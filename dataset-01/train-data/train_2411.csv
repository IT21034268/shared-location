3,Unsure about this one...,I dusted my dog with this and he's been throwing up ever since. He had never thrown up before using this product. So it's made me concerned.
4,natural product,Much better to use to controll pests around the house without chemicals. The only thing should be changed is the container. It has arrived in plastic bags. Thank you for considering the change.
4,DE -food grade,"I bought this to be used as an animal parasite killer. It seems that both my pet cat and dog were infected by some parasite that had entered their body. I mixed a tsp. of the DE into their meals for 10 days and it worked well. My pets had no problem with the taste of their food, and the parasite is gone."
4,diatomaceous earth food grade,"I ordered this at what I thought was a good price ,and got good delivery service I read a lot about the health benefits but don't know how its working It is supposed to be good for a lot of other things as well"
3,How to get Diatomeous earth stains out of mattress.,Ok I bought this product because I had bed bugs. I put it on my mattress and underneath it on the box spring. I left and came back at night. I took paper towels and wiped off the larger accumulations. I was left with large white stains(somewhat funny) on my mattress. I probably used to much of it.(I know to use less next time) Parts of the mattress there are no D-Earth stains but there are a number of large white stains. The mattress has a dark blackish blue color so the stain are noticeable. Does anyone have any advice or experience with these stains? I've tried dish soap with a towel as well however they keep returning every time I wipe them down. I'm planning on purchasing hydrogen peroxide and using that as it is suppose to dissolve D-earth. I Would really appreciate any advice.
3,I like the product..,".. BUT, the packaging sucks. It didn't come in the white/green bag (as pictured), it came in a large clear plastic bag.. no reusable tie or zip-lock, rather inconvenient. Other than that, the product is good."
1,Doesn't work...,"I bought this food grade DE for indoor and outdoor use to kill fleas. I spread this stuff all over my house and instead of killing the fleas, it just made a thick dust cloud in my house and gave me a cough for 2 days. The stuff is so thick that my vaccum crapped out on me when I still had 2 rugs left to do. Still trying to clean it up..."
4,This product is a good value.,"I previously purchased 1 lb. of diatomaceous earth from a brick and mortor retailer and the contents were pure white. The diatomaceous earth from PureEarth D was an off white/ light beige color. Is the off-white product as pure as the pure white product I purchased earlier? I am new to this product and do not know what I should expect. The off-white PureEarth D product is ground finer and does not have as gritty a texture as the pure white product I bought first. I am using PureEarth D for its health benefits and am experiencing no ill effects. I can also use the off-white diatomaceous earth product as insecticide if I can’t safely consume it. Although I was not experiencing any health issues before I started using diatomaceous earth, I continue to use it to maintain good health."
4,Diatomaceous Earth Food Grade 10 Lb,Diatomaceous Earth Food Grade 10 LbDidn't work to get bugs as well as expected...shipped quickthanks and stuff
3,Not too sure yet...,"I'm using this DE to try to control the flea issue I'm having. I've tried so many different products so far. I buy the expensive medicine from the vet and I didn't get good results from that. I don't like using toxic chemicals on my pets any more that I have too. My dog gets infested with fleas! Even days after vet medicine. (So what's worse, toxic chemicals or fleas?) I bathe her every several days and keep finding MORE fleas. I'm giving her Brewer's Yeast with garlic, bathing her with Dawn dishwashing liquid, dusting her with Diatomaceous Earth, washing her bedding every week, vacuuming daily and she is STILL infested! I'm at my wits end. So I cannot give this product a good rating either. Nothing seems to be working. There are no directions on how to use this product. I dusted her with lots of this stuff because it's supposed to be so safe. Guess I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and pray for a COLD winter to KILL these little buggers!! UGH!!!"
3,Good value,I don't know for sure if the product is working yet or not. Tough to spread without a duster. Looks like a bag of flour exploded where I put it.
5,Great product,We purchased the diatomaceous earth to protect our house naturally against fleas for our dogs. Application is a bit difficult however the results are worth it. We sprinkled the diatomaceous earth all over the carpets then spread it around with a broom. We let it sit for a day or so then vacuumed several times. The dust is very fine and floats in the air for awhile after applying to the carpet and it is extremely dusty to walk around. Overall though we have not found one flea and we are very happy with the product.
3,Not enough,"This stuff is cool and great for conversation starting but it's not enough. I used it, lots of fun for a Saturday project. When it came time to vacuum it up my vacuum kept stalling due to the fineness of the powder. It has the consistancy of talc powder, silky. If you do decide to use it, wear a respirator mask and isolate your pets from the area you are working in.In the end I also bought Ultracide, a combination flea killer and growth interrupter because the diatomaceous earth does not kill the eggs and the larvae. The literature says it is not toxic to humans and pets after a few hours. The toxicity comes from the flea killer, the growth interrupter is not toxic to mammals or non-larval insects at all."
3,It's not as safe as some would lead you to believe.,"Reading up on diatomaceous earth everyone suggests making sure to apply it only with a protective mask. At the same time, it's often touted as ""100% Safe"" and ""Completely Non Toxic"". Bull.It's basically microscopic particles of glass (glass dust). As soon as you open the bag it gets EVERYWHERE- it's so light and takes to the air so quickly that it might as well qualify as a gas. You breathe in that stuff and your lungs will not be happy campers. I inhaled just the smallest amount by accident and I'm still feeling the scratchyness 2 hours afterwards. I can only guess what it's doing to the linings and alveoli of my lungs.I'm sure it kills roaches and ants, etc. but it is not a wonder powder. It needs to be handled with care and caution- and I think it's extremely irresponsible for those marketing it to misrepresent it's safety and not provide proper warning notices."
5,"Many, many uses!!!","I love D.E. it is super safe for humans and animals. I not only keep a light layer of it all around the inside edges of the house and outside around enterances to keep all insects OUT! I also gave it to my dogs in the food just in case of paracites or toxins. I even used it to clean out my system! I shared a little w/ a friend for insects in the house and he had great results. So many uses, safe and inexpensive! One cam't ask for more."
5,"Organic pest control, simple and easy","This product, diatomaceous earth, is a silica compound made from ancient seas and fossils. When roaches crawl over even a fine dusting, the crystals puncture and dehydrate the insect. I have been using it in my basement, especially around the water heater and drain pipe, and under the sinks as here in Albuquerque roaches mostly come in through the water systems. All I ever see is a few very dead roaches that make it past the waterheater/furnace room!"
1,Unhappy,"Didn't work for me. My pets are still rife with fleas! This is so powdery, not sure it delivers what it promises: ""little razor blades that cut the exoskeletons"". My dog still scratches herself to bleeding no matter how much of this product I use on her!"
1,NOT GOOD FOR FLEA REMOVAL,"I BOUGHT IT TO KILL FLEAS IN THE HOUSE. BUT IT DIDN'T WORK, JUST MADE A DUSTY MESS. I'M GOING TO FIND ANOTHER USE FOR IT, WAS A LARGE AMOUNT FOR LITTLE MONEY, BUT DID'T EFFECT MY FLEA POPULATION."
1,Not what I expected!!!,"I bought this item, because we have bedbug problem in our house after researching online that this type of product helps to kill bedbugs more efficiently and quickly. Well, after trying this product as suggested by the online community, our bedbug problem never went away. In fact, we still have them and are finding them begs in places we sprinkled this powder. Apparently, after reading more on this online, I found out that you need a different grade of powder, which is more dangerous to human and your pets. After using just little and seeing the result, I have not used it again. I will probably throw it away."
1,Didnt work for me,Not only is this product hard to apply.... it didnt work for me.... maybe i didnt put enough down but it just didnt help curb my bug problem at all... not to mention it is messy.... it wasnt worth my money and is now sitting in my closet going to waist..... dont bother.... deal with the chemical ways... they are MUCH more effective
3,Super fast delivery not used yet for that end of it.,"This product looks quality and it was packaged well. Came in like 4 days super fastdelivery. I have tried it around in the garage area so far here in the Winter months in TX.But of course the garage had been major cleaned recently and bombed a couple of times.So, next I am going to try in in the perimeter to see if it deters the chiggers and in the barns forspiders and around the perimeter of the house for scorpions. I will repost in a couple of months tolet you know how it worked on these pests."
3,Writing = 5/5 Art = 1/5 - short review,"There's no denying the importance and greatness of Astro City as a literary work. Unfortunately, the stellar writing is complemented by a sloppy, choppy rendering of art by Brent Anderson. Many people are able to overlook art and focus on story. I'm not one of those people. For me, great art can supercede decent writing, but likewise, bad art can kill wonderful writing. This book takes the latter route.Anderson's art is just plain sloppy. There really is no other way to describe it. And it's not just a fluke - I felt the same way about Rising Stars (a beautiful JMS series that was completely ruined at the end by an awful artful finish of the last few issues by Anderson). To me, this made the book nearly unreadable.I tried, I really did. I tried to overlook it, but I couldn't.If art is important to you, I'd give this book a pass."
4,A fun read...!!,"A DC-reading friend of mine has been after me for years to check this title out... So I *finally* did, and it's great fun. Kurt Busiek, who brought the Marvel heroes down to earth in the acclaimed ""Marvels"" series, again looks at the capes through the eyes of the regular citizenry, but this time it's in the fabled streets of Astro City, a place with more superbeings per square mile than anyplace ever seen before. Busiek revels in the giddy, kitschy, high-flying storytelling style of the classic comicbooks of yesteryear -- if you read DC or Marvel in the 1960s or early '70s, these stories will have a familiar feel. ""Astro City"" cheerfully riffs on numerous superhero archetypes, with parallels to Superman, Wonder Woman, The Fantastic Four, etc. -- all playfully tweaked into a new, all-fun, irony-free universe, where it's clobbering time all the time and all the streets are named after comicbook artists, publishers and the like... Long story short: I'm hooked. Bring on the next volume!"
3,Uhhh....It was okay.,"Let me start with this: I am not a big comics fanatic. I read some of these bigger collections from time to time for entertainment, but I've never been to a comic book shop, I don't own a Green Lantern shirt and there's no Superman sticker on my car.But, I do know what I like and, for me, Astro City was an ""okay"" collection of new superheroes. This collections includes 5 stories, 2 of which I found tedious. In the intro, Busiek claims to want to get back to basics and stop the ""deconstruction"" of the superhero. Get out of the superhero's head and back to the action. But, the first and last stories are all about getting into the superhero's head. They were interesting stories, but they went against the spirit Busiek claimed to have been wanting to avoid.In short, kudos to Busiek for creating a whole new world of superheroes, but this still didn't grab me enough to make me look for further adventures of these new superheroes."
5,The best of all four!!!,"This game is the is the best of all four!!! I mean its excellent! the new heroes, the new faction: Angmar and it's cool powers, The new campaign story mode, the new ideas, the new ""create a hero"" options and it's new class: the trolls, and even more!! What i really like is that there is the new faction (Angmar). The snow trolls are special because their clubs are strong enough to kill Eowyn!! ""That is if you have two packs of snow trolls"". And Angmar is really good! if there are sixty groups of enemies, an avalanche could kill all of them in two rolls!!!If you try inflicting fell wind on an enemy hero it gives you the chance to strike him/her while on the ground! The game is just so nice!!!Really, this is a game that DESERVES five stars. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! IT'S WAITING FOR U OUT THERE!!!"
3,This game gave me anger problems,"this game could have been so much better, this game is SO umbalanced. the new faction Angmar is easily the most powerful faction in the game next to the drawrves which makes me so mad because, this is a pretty good game other than these problems, the other problem is the worst AI known to man, (next to superman 64) it will completely ignore your units and go for your resource buildings (espicialy on brutal) maybe... just maybe a patch will come out and fix the bugs and if so get this game"
1,Unable to play due to errors,After receiving and installing the game was unable to play due to an dat.error. Apparently this is a known issue from EA forums that many people experience after instillation. DO NOT recommend buying as EA has not released a fix. The only way is to download a torrent with a no cd crack which is not a fix.
4,An excellent addition,"While the witch king does not dramatically change game play, it does add to the original game.The Angar faction is a wonderful addition. They have added new, much needed, units to the other factions, additional maps, and beefed up the create a hero system. They also added a few heroes to some of the factions, like the Dale hero from the dwarven side.I heard that the War of the Ring additions are also great, but I haven't had a chance to dig into that.Overall, this expansion has peaked my interest in playing the game. I mostly play it on skirmish mode with other players. If you like the original, you will definetly like the additions with this expansion."
5,"a fascinating, honest account","This book has warmth, insight, precision. Michel Thomas lived an extraordinary life, and the story here has been wonderfully told. Potential readers should not be influenced by comments posted at Amazon by journalist Roy Rivenburg.One can only hope that readers will find their way to this remarkable book including the new last chapter added by author Christopher Robbins to the paperback edition. The new material convincingly responds to Mr. Rivenburg's attack on Michel Thomas' credibility--and sadly underscores just how how cavalier the press can sometimes be about somebody's good name."
4,Cute and comfortable,"Price: The sale price was unbeatable in the $20s.Shipping: Was fast! Two days with standard I believe.Product Quality: Cute and very comfortable. There are no supports holding up the leg portion, so it's real flimsy. Because there are no supports, I wouldn't recommend this as a snow boot. Perhaps as a fall/colder weather boot to keep your feet warm and looking good."
5,A Timeless Guide To Farm Enterprise At The Market,"Having enjoyed Jeff Ishee's ""Virginia Farm Monitor"" program via RFD-TV weekly for a while, I was happy to discover his book. It was pricey since it is ""out of print"" and thus a ""collector's"" but worth every penny of the price I paid. Common sense and insider tips abound, and if you've ever considered selling your produce or products at a Farmer's Market or even organizing one in your community, this is the ""bible"" of such enterprise and something you'll need to succeed. The author tells the story in personal terms based on his own experience but also includes a section of responses he got when the book was in ""beta"" and he put it online for comments by other farmer's market sellers and growers. Therefore, while it is based on his VA experiences, it really applies to all such markets everywhere."
3,Front inputs will break down,"I like this video selector, but it would have been more effective if the front inputs didn't breakdown so soon. My suggestion would be use the front inputs but never unplug them , otherwise this is a good selector."
2,This George is OFF,"Despite being a Deep Dish fan, I was very disappointed with this. DD stick to what you know best (GU & Renaissance)"
2,Commercial,"The commercial mixes of Deep Dish.If you are just getting into electronic music, this would be an option. Obviously not a cd for the advanced..."
4,Sweet,"I'm a big Deep Dish fan. So I had to buy this one right when it dropped. I must say I'm very happy with it as far as an artist album goes. I'm not a huge fan of Morel's voice, however I LOVE Anousheh's vocals on her 3 songs. The remixes are also very stellar, giving great use to any DJ who wants to spin some kickass versions of ""Say Hello"". Maybe a few slight mishaps here or there, but all in all, I must say each song bears enjoyable elements to me. The ""Dreams"" remake is wonderfull as well."
4,I still listen to this.,"I love this duo and I love this album and I especially love the second half of it. The remix of ""Dreams"" is so light and spacey. And the song ""Say Hello"" is clearly an iconic hit from that period of time in dance music."
3,"Great DJ's...Mediocre ""Producers""","I was pretty excited about Deep Dish's second studio album. In my opinion, when these guys mix as a duo, they are difficult to top. Anyone who has had the pleasure of listening to them live would probably agree unless they don't like house and progressive house music. Unfortunately, I don't think their amazing mixing skills translate into the world of producing.I'm not sure what I was expecting from this album. Probably something a little closer to the tracks featured in their amazing four disc set, Global Underground 025:Toronto.George is On contains four tracks that I actually enjoy. The rest are very mediocre and a couple are fairly lame.If you love GU021:Moscow and GU025:Toronto and expect similar tracks on this album...you will be DEEPly disappointed. I was."
2,"Too ""pop"" vocal for me","Everyone saw it coming. The turn from hard line bass lines and cool sexy vocal tracks TO mainstream billboard ""poppy"" tracks. Don't get me wrong...Flashdance is now a classic as well as the Say Hello ""hit."" But these are the only exceptions. Overall the CD seems to be an effort to get into the mainstream. A place that I would rather not be."
4,great,"I got this for my Wife who isn't into electronics, but she finds it easy to use and loves that it came in pink. No problems so far, have had it for several months now."
2,Great while it lasted,this was a fine product while it lasted even though the file navigation is a little primative for todayit lasted a total of 9 and a half months would never buy another archos product
3,"Among other things, a pain in the butt to clean","We had the predecessor to this model, until it plummeted to its death. At this point I have completely come to accept that store bought bread must be trimmed to fit. The big complaints are as follows:It's huge, they added a cord wrap and rounded the lid, so that the unit is now nearly twice the size. Harder to store.Hard to clean, you cannot remove the grill plates, and cannot immerse. This, combinded with these openings behind the lid where oily stuff accumulates, can make it really difficult to get the unit truly clean. It would be worth it to find one with removable grills.Overall its a great product we use every morning for french toast."
5,Strauss: Die Fledermaus,"It''s a special edition, with great operastars as guests at von Eisensteins big party."
3,the hoarse whisperer,"I honestly want to like this album. I ordered it ages ago and waited forever for it. Well, I finally got it and... ehh.The music and sampling is great, totally smooth, an amazing job. The thing I find so off putting is the vocals (he can't hit the notes and endlessly whispers out of tune) and the lame lyrics (juvenile and predictable). I think mr. Coates would be great if he stuck to the instrumentals. I wish there was a karaoke version available without the vocals.maybe it will grow on me. I don't know.This is his 1st album, so maybe things will improve."
1,"Poorly planned, I don't know who this book is for","The description of this book says it's for ASP developers transitioning to ASP.NET. I have worked with ASP for over a year, and this book was pretty much useless. The only redeeming factor was that I was able to get it from my local library, so I found out before it cost me any cash. The first part of the book delves into topics with zero explanation, and very little code, so you don't have a chance to get your feet wet with actual code, and the topics are dull and dry. The last portion of the book looks like it would be a nice reference, but honestly, why would you buy a book like this for a reference? Isn't that what the 'net is for?Two thumbs down. I'm working through a Sam's teach yourself in 21 days book and it is significantly better for anyone transitioning from classic ASP or learning ASP.NET from scratch,"
4,Great book for history of Denver,I am a native of Denver and remember some of these mansions before they were demolished. I bought the book to get the background history of the houses. It give a lot of the history of ownership and dates.
2,tv episodes,"never liked the planet of children episode with starbuck ,couldnt see kids taking the cylons on one on one ,still dirk benedit did get to lock lips with audrey landers that in itself has inspired fantasies over the years, anyway dont buy unless you want more back story on the tv episodes"
2,decent but not stable,"Decent product but hard drive did not seem to be held in there well - you get exactly what you pay for on this. If you value what's on the drive, spend the extra money just to be on the safe side. Also requires use of two USB drives.I returned mine."
5,Fits my needs,This works perfectly if you have an old 2.5 ide drive. Only complaint I have is that the screws were tiny and hard to screw in.
1,Did Not Work!,"Item purchased utilizing product description @ Startech.com, thinking I would obtain the most accurate info. I was wrong and should have used Amazon's info. How Amazon got it right and the Mfg did not, is idiotic. Mfg site states it is precisely for the use of a 2.5"" ATA/IDE hard drive. It does not fit an ATA/IED hard drive. I guess it is for a 2.5"" PATA/IDE hard drive as described by Amazon, but I can not confirm this. I suppose my main frustration is with Startech.com and not Amazon. But in any case, I am very peeved, Especially after running into, basically the same problem I had in an attempt to get one from the Best Buy boneheads. They are losers as well!"
4,"Eric Clapton, Sessions for Robert Johnson","EC is infatuated with Robert Johnson. He decided to make a CD/DVD of recording the music of Mr. Johnson. He surrounded himself with great musicians and performed the music admirably. Not a true representation of Robert Johnsons music, but replaying it with EC's style and talent, backed up by guitars, piano, organ, drums and recorded in different venues that allowed EC his moment to pay homage to the man who had given him inspiration for Blues of the Americas. Good viewing and listening. I hope EC gets back to contempory music of which he also does well."
5,Fantastic!,This DVD and CD collection is perfect for the Blues fan. Eric Clapton is an amazing musician and recreates Robert Johnsons' music perfectly. Well directed and filmed.
4,One size,"There arn't any size adjustments other than the size of the leg holes and the strap accross the chest. I find this harness just a bit too big for me at 5'10"" 175 lbs. Quality is excelent."
4,Good value,"Relatively easy to put on and reasonably comfortable. Durable and strong. I like the hip D rings. Good buy if you only wear it a few times a week. If I were going to spend hours every day in one, I'd spend for a little more luxury."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle","I enjoyed the first half of the book, the way the author did not try to tell you what Nostradsmus was thinking. He layed it out for you with several definitions for you to think for yourself. He also says honestly that he doesn't know what is going to happen in the future since no one knows for sure what Nostradamus was actually thinking and seeing at that time.Then he starting preaching the bible. I respect religion and practice it myself but the last half of the book is about the comandments and saving yourself. That is not what I bought the book for. The first half was a very enjoyable book."
4,Dream cast,"The pairing of Netrebko and Garanca is simply as good as it gets. The role of Boleyn is about as grueling as there is in Italian opera, and it is difficult to imagine anyone else in it today."
4,Anna Bolena,"This beautiful, intense opera fell out of favor because of a preference for love stories and novelties. But in 2011 the work was revived for Anna Netrebko, perhaps the greatest dramatic soprano of the decade. The staging for the Vienna State Opera production is basic, and the costumes show that they are made of light, modern materials, but the singing is incredible. Netrebko as Anne Bolyen and beautiful Elina Garanca as Jane Seymour are outstanding, especially in Act II. There is no sign of strain in their voices, even in what seem like extremely difficult passages. The recent Met production with Netrebko was visually more compelling, but I think this production is a little better. The last few minutes -- in which Boleyn's young daughter, Elizabeth, appears wordlessly and sees her mother's (simulated) execution -- are striking. This two disc set is something that may lead you to go out and tell others about it."
1,"Great Performance, Bad DVD","The costumes, performances and music were fantastic but the DVD was defective in that it only gave Italian subtitles, so I returned it. I tried twice to get English subtitles but each time it played Italian subtitles. Then I tried German subtitles; again, Italian. And so on through several more languages in the subtitle menu. I'll reorder in a few months when Amazon gets a fresh batch, hopefully with functioning subtitles."
4,"Nice performance, but so many cuts","I must confess I was very skeptical when I knew that Netrebko was going to sing Anna Bolena, the first of Donizetti's trilogy about the Tudor Queens. Well she was pretty good, much better than I expected. True, she's not perfect and her beautiful voice lacks agility. Also she has some breath problems; however I enjoyed her performance. Garanca is more on style here and her voice blends perfectly with Netrebko's. I didn't care so much about the production. A dull scene with lavish costumes but static, and with little interest apart from looking at the gorgeous dresses. The Wienners sound glorious, even with a 'routinier' like Pidò. There are many cuts, most the cabalettas are abridged. Also the confrontation scene from Act 2 is heavily cut."
1,The Art of Teaching Art,I bought this book hoping for clues to help my high school students. It didn't happen. This book would be a good choice for college instructors.
5,The Art of Teaching Art,This book teaches in depth the learning foundations of drawing based art for higher level arts students. The book requires lots of reading and study: it also has many black and white examples of principals being taught. The language could be somewhat confusing for non artists.
4,where's the DVD version?,"It surprises me that so many terrible movies have been converted and released to a DVD format, while this excellent classic along with so many others have not for whatever reason."
2,High cringe factor for me,"I really enjoyed her ""The Daddy Clock"" but this effort was all kinds of wrong. Yes the narrative and the dialog are snappy in parts, but the monumental duplicity that is exercised in this novel really made me wince. I prescribe to the concept that people have secrets and telling your loved ones about actions you've taken can cause more harm than not and hence should not be disclosed, but Kate/Karen just went overboard and the ramifications, while ultimately not catastrophic, still left me with a queasy feeling in my gut."
4,The world needs more Prince Buster!,"If they'd spent a few more bucks spent on audio restoration, this could have been wicked! That said, the sound is certainly NOT terrible as was previously suggested. I can't say the choice of songs is definitive, either, and the liner notes are barely there. So, why should you buy this? Because from the first note to the last, this collection rocks! Prince Buster is a true original and, at least until someone puts out the anthology the Prince truly deserves, this belongs in your collection, even if you just have a passing interest in ska."
2,Dissappointing sound,"This disc is the first and the last one for my Prince Buster collection. The sound is terrible, I understand that this musician recorded its music more than 40 years, but there is no intention for remastering the original records. The music as well as the lyrics is not that good. I would rather recommend ska musicians like The Skatalites."
3,Hay mejores,"Esta obra es muy buena y ha sido por años un clásico en la enseñanza del griego del Nuevo Testamento en el mundo de habla inglesa, pero tiene la debilidad de ser una traducción del inglés de una obra que no toma en cuenta al estudiante de habla española. Yo prefiero El griego bíblico al alcance de todos de José Antonio Septién,Editorial CLIE. También la gramática que usan los estudiantes de FLET, Aprendamos griego de Clarence Hale, que aunque es una traducción, ha sido completamente revisada y adaptada para el estudiante de habla castellana. Esta última la distribuye Editorial UNILIT."
5,Baker's Rack,These cooling racks are great! The space between each square is small enough so that your cookies don't fall through!
4,Great Product!,"I really love these cooling racks. They are nice and big so I can put a dozen or more cookies on each one as necessary. I also like how flat they are, making them easy to store. Highly recommend."
5,Great product for my simple needs,"I love to bake for myself, my family, and my friends. This serves my needs. They are sturdy and nonstick. Great for everyday use, and they clean up well. I would buy them again."
1,"Another nothing special ""Wunderkind""","This record is a BORE. Nothing special in any way. When will the record labels stop piling on the ""Kid Prodigy"" crud? What next, a 4- year-old on the spoons? Specifically, there is nothing good about this record, banal songwriting,lousy production, and the simple fact that there are Dozens and Dozens of better guitarists out there."
2,"okay, just okay","This record isn't bad - but I saw his stage show in New Orleans and thought it was pretty lame - amateurish - which is what you'd expect from someone his age. There is a lot of hype about ""the next Hendrix or Stevie Ray"" Having seen both of these greats lots of times, I have to say that this guy is no Hendrix, no SRV. As with Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, the playing is strictly cerebral, thought out, preplanned, not from the heart - not from the soul. I have only seen one player reach the level of Jimi and Stevie Ray, and that it Mato Nanji of Indigenous. Of all coinciedences, I saw him at the same New Orleans show aforementioned - Jake was opening for Indigenous. Nanji is the only living guitarist who plays with that spirit and soul, and can honestly be classified amongst the greats - I hope him a long life, watching him play, summoning the spirit, is truely spellbinding and awe inspiring."
1,Stinker,"A series of borrowed chops and borrowed tunes played at or below the level of any average Austin TX guitarist, a waste of hard-earned money in my case"
3,Not Too Bad Freshmen Effort,"When I saw him play as a kid four or so years ago I thought he might turn out to be something special. This CD is pretty good, but not as good as I would have hoped for. It is a bit uneven as he appears to be poking around different styles to see what catches on. Also, the only real strong material is the stuff someone else wrote.I think Jake may be the best of the many young male blues/rock artists out there --he can play, sing, and write his own tunes. If any of them are destined to make it, he will be the one. I hope he sticks with it, improves his song writing skills, and waxes some cuts showcasing the true talent I think he is. He has a decent voice for a 19 year old. I look forward to more from Jake."
4,Time saving instruction and well thought out topics.,"This is a good instructional book. It tackles several Dreamweaver techniques and offers a good variety of time saving tips.The book really stands out because of its real world application. Almost every section can be applied to real design and development situations. The projects are well designed and the techniques are, for the most part, easy to follow and are backed by sound design.Unfortuneatly, many books in this series are very simple, ""show and tells,"" lacking useful instruction. That is not the case with this book. New Riders hit the target on this one."
4,Info Packed!,"This book is filled with solid, practical tips that will help any developer broaden his/her knowledge and skill set within Dreamweaver MX. It covers what most users are asking for in the Newsgroups. A worth-while investment in time and money."
4,a side project from Ash Ra Tempel and Krautrock Scene,"This is a cheaper version of the Tarot (ohr disc); a project which is basically an Ash Ra Tempel + Wallenstein thing, i.e. Ash Ra Temple with more melodic piano passages. The best thing - the tarot artwork - is missing in this version, which makes it much less enjoyable. Afterall, it's a little jam session that similar to the cosmic jokers series (e.g. galatic supermarket, etc). Not very impressive, a nice collectible anyway."
5,my baby sleeps to this cd,some of the songs are a little quicker but overall it is a very relaxing cd & my baby falls asleep to this music every night. Definitely falling asleep music when played softly.
4,Another book that's heavy on the Airstreams,"As the owner of a '54 Yellowstone camper, I was excited to find a book that marketed itself as being about all those other silver trailers that don't get all the attention that Airstreams do. Someone could and should do a book that provides in-depth coverage about all the aluminum beauties out there that doesn't devote 80 pages to Airstreams.This book provided lots of beautiful photography and historical information. Don't get me wrong, we did end up enjoying it quite a bit, but not for the reasons I had initially hoped."
3,maybe not best choice,"This is a pretty good recording and probably worth the money, but not the one I'd recommend. Maybe just the fault of the sound engineer, but the piano does not come through strongly enough. Instead go for Andras Schiff with Ivan Fisher and Budapest Festival Orchestra."
4,An introduction to Bell,"This disc provides a fine blend of virtuoso and lyrical pieces, offering Bell a chance to show all dimensions of his talent. He finds repose in the Schumann, soaring lyricism in the Sibelius, and plenty of technical fireworks in the Sarasate and Wieniawski pieces. For the nit picky, the torrential thirds in the finale of the Carmen are a bit untidy and there is a regretfully insecure chord at 5:01 in the Bloch. Otherwise, his performances are well played and offer a fine introduction to his prodigious talent."
4,pretty good,"Neuwirth's Shadow Cities provides a good account of areas of towns come into existence largely outside of the traditional legal framework. Neuweirth deals with Rio, Mumbai, Istanbul and Nairobi as examples. He goes into how these areas developed, how they deal with the local governments, how businesses have been created and how infrastructure has developed.Neuwirth also deals with how such slums/shantytowns/other preferred term have existed in the first world, mainly in regards to the US to illustrate how such areas have developed. He also deals with how these areas and their residents are perceived on the outside."
4,"Tremendous start, disastrous dissappointment","I will go to my main point on this book by Mr. Neuwirth, the first chapters are engaging and very interesting to read. He basically writes on the daily life in ""slums"" of Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Istambul, and Nairobi. These first chapters are the only chapters worth reading as he presents very interesting finds while living for months in these ""shadow cities."" I actually studied in Brazil for a year and spent my last three months living in Rocinha, which is the favela (slum) he investigates and writes about, i found all his descriptions and overall view of Rocinha credible. The last chapters, as other reviewers mentioned, are not that interesting as it fails to make a point, although, it has some interesting facts about the history of ""slums."" Finally, I would really recommend reading Mike Davis's work, Planet of Slums, It is a great work on ""slums>"""
3,"Functional, but not robustly designed. Worth half the money!","In this price range, and with the usage of the word ""premium"" I honesly expected better. As I type this review, the keyboard bounces up and down about a quarter of an inch; and the adjuster lever is tight as can be... It's just the sheet metal is too thin to offer much rigidity. Also, the tolerances in the sliding mechanism are overly loose, so that when fully tightened, I can still swing the tray side to side by about 3/4 of an inch. On the plus side, this platform IS large and does easily adjust for height and angle, and also slides easily out of the way."
1,No plastic window,"Just has a hole in the metal for the screen, no clear plastic protection. Also has a removable plastic spring clip on the back, not a wrist cord like in the picture. Caveat emptor."
2,Angry angular attempts,Severely limited abrasions merely updating the minimalist assault patterns avant-punk bands like Lightening Bolt were implementing years before.
3,Menomena's underground gem,"I first discovered 'I Am The Fun Blame Monster' last year and was impressed, and I still have the same thoughts now compared to when I first heard it. Menomena's debut sounds unlike anything that's out there, a hybrid of musical styles combined to create completely fresh and unique. Just think post-rock meets jazz with a touch of DJ Shadow. The beats have the time-signatures of electronic music, but by using real percussion. Thrown in there are these spacey, almost trip-hop sounding, experimental noises. This CD probably won't be included on any Best Of lists at the end of the year, yet musical creativity is in the ear of the beholder. 'I Am The Fun Blame Monster' should be part of your personal best of 2004, it definitley belongs there."
2,a tease,"A book which is not bad as a quickie read on the basics of Camille, but it comes up quite short as an authoritative source on the storm. Many survivors stories, while compelling at times, begin to sound repetitive, and, strangely enough, leave the reader with a sense that not all has been told.It is also quite apparent that the author is a born-again Christian, as he often elects to print survivor contentions that they were saved from the storm by their personal Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Not that this is bad per se, but is does add to the repetitiveness of the narrative, and after hearing it once it seems superfluous, as well as adding a hidden agenda to the text.This is not a National Geographic-style book about Camille; it tends to stay on a base emotional level; hardly detached, never scientific, and certainly not the last word on the topic. A disappointment, in short."
1,Avoid this book. Not worth the read.,"Horrible book filled with numerous inaccuracies. Among the most noticeable was the part about the so-called ""Hurricane Party"". The party never happened and Mary Ann Gerlach was not the lone survivor, several people survived the destruction of the Richilieu apartments. Seriously get it right. The book also contained numerous meteorological errors. Sad that this book glosses over one of the most well known and destructive hurricanes to have ever hit the United States."
2,Not in color nor good on kindle fire,"This book is not really very visible on the kindle fire. It depends upon illustrations that are delivered in low resolution, and not in color as stated. I don't see much point in buying or renting this book as the information depends upon completeness."
5,Neat Study of Hustle Moves,"Book discusses home poker games. However, the value of the book lies in its description of various hustle moves that can be done at the table for those who want to take every advantage in a game."
2,Very Basic Book,"My husband and I are starting to think about having kids so I thought this book would be a good place to start with a basic overview. It does do that but it didn't say anything different or insightful that I couldn't find for free online. (i.e. don't drink alcohol, no smoking, chemical hazards)Most of this book(16 chapters) deals with infertility. This is something that I don't need so most of this book was not useful to me.I would pass on this book. There are definitely better books out there like, The Mother of All Pregnancy Books: The Ultimate Guide to Conception, Birth, and Everything In Between."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The first 1/3 of the book was helpful as far as what to expect and the changes your body will go through while pregnant. The last 2/3 of the book was all about infertility...not what I expected. This is a great book if you and your partner are having problems conceiving but otherwise, not a good buy."
4,a fan,"I just saw Becky, Gordon Johnson, Brian Fesler, and Susan Christianson play live. Amazingly this CD does not quite capture Becky live. Becky and her band are truly talented. I like this CD, Drifter Like Me, California Night, and Cheyenne are great songs on the CD. They have a bluegrass feel and have beautiful harmonies."
1,Would give it 0 stars if available.,"Very poor documentation to use the player and the web site of Lexar does not support the unit. Do not buy this device, you will be sorry."
2,"Gorgeous moments, but only a hint of what would follow","Lisa Germano is a truly creative artist for the '90s. This isn't the best CD to find that out, but it's an album Germano fans should check out. Lisa spent considerable time in the '80s as a session musician for touring musicians. But her debut, 'Moon Palace' has attitude. That courage & attitude carries the record. ""Riding My Bike"" is a nasty show of how roadside perverts leer, and how women rise above it. Many of the best tracks are instrumental, with violin and Eno-esque lofi controls. This is beautiful but uneven stuff - still required if you're a fan of Lisa Germano."
1,Poorly made mp3 player,"I purchased a Creative Zen V mp3 player 3 weeks ago - during the course of a walk the on/off switch fell off and got lost. The company refuses warranty coverage claiming normal wear and tear. This is a poorly made product, do not purchase one."
3,"Great sound, nice looks, spotty reliability!",Creative makes very nice toys but I have had big issues with reliabilty! This Zen V plus lasted 10 months before the display faded and shortly after the unit died. Still under warranty...but you have to pay a $25 service fee + shipping! My son had a Zen Microphoto that lasted a little over a year before it too crapped out. C'mon Creative...let's get with the program!
1,Battery life= 1 hour,"The battery lasts roughly 1 hour, creating a practically useless product. The design is fine- its small and easy to use; however, because of the insanely short battery life, I wish I had gone with another mp3 player."
3,Neat...but,"There is a lot to like about this MP3 player but ..for those of us who are sometimes electronically challenged the instruction book is a little on the ""poor in explaining"" catagory. While relatively simple to install music into the unit am having problems with being able to manage the music once it is installed."
3,"Technologically sound, mechanically defective","I chose the Zen V Plus for a couple of reasons, not the least of them being its fantastic price. It just seemed to do so much more than the iPod for so much less. I couldn't put it down! Sadly, very shortly after I got it, a small crack that had been growing steadily in the joystick finally gave way, splitting the thin plastic. I exchanged it for another, hopefully less problematic one. With both players, I encountered sporadic freezing, but on the second one, the reset button didn't work. I gave up and just sent that one in for a refund. It may just have been bad luck, seeing as I know others who have not encountered these problems, but be forewarned: the plastic seems quite fragile. If it weren't for the manufacturing, I would have given it a full 5-star rating."
4,Very satisfied with the product,"Pros:Drag and Drop compatibilityFM tuner and voice recordingPhotos and videos featureColors on the screenSleek designDecent battery lifeClick wheelPrice (atleast $70 cheaper than 4GB Ipod Nano)Cons:Location of buttons, though not a big deal once you get used to it.Headphones supplied does not fit tight in earslack of good accessories.Had bought this for $95 (after MIR), its every penny worth. Very satisfied with it."
2,Zen Player,"This player is ok. It tends to skip on tracks periodically. Sometimes it will skip (stop playing a track without the display showing that it's paused) 1 to 3 times in one track. That gets annoying very quickly. Also, the software I had for it is designed for Win XP, but NOT Win Vista/7. If you try managing the files on Windows Vista/7 without the Creative software, good luck. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Even the Creative software, when used on XP can be a bit hairy to figure out.I should have known better than to buy a Creative brand product. Had a CD-RW drive of theirs on a computer. The drive didn't last very long - maybe a year or so."
4,Good replacement,"I bought a used Zen V to replace the one that broke for my husband. He's had issues with two others, so I didn't want to spend a ton on a third one. We already have some extra items (speakers and such) for the Zen V, so that's why we stick with it. So far, this one is working well. Most likely we will move to a different brand soon due to the issues (freezing up usually) that keep happening with the Zen V."
2,Not Worth the Plastic It's Made Of,Anyone who would pay $100 for this device is seriously not in their right frame of mind. Anyone who would actually pay the MSRP of $200 is an outright sucker.Here goes: My player constantly crashes. The library deletes itself whenever it wants. The battery life is extremely short. It doesn't charge as it's supposed to. Sound quality is average at best.I now realize why Apple has the brand loyalty it has.
2,"I love Creative, but this is disappointing","I bought my first one used from Amazon back in July and within 2 weeks, the screen died. I ordered another one, only to have the firmware corrupt and whenever I tried to reload the firmware, the player would disconnect from my PC. At first it seemed nice. It had decent sound and a good size of screen, but for all the trouble, it's not worth the money. Creative doesn't give a long enough warranty. I have a Creative sound card and sound system for my PC which have been wonderful, and my brothers each have a Vision M which has no problems, so I'm disappointed in the quality. And why is it $300 now? It was only $80 when I bought the first two this past summer. There's no way it's worth $300, let alone, $80."
4,works great,"the sound quality is very good, i like being able to just drag & drop files into the player have not found any problems with it so far"
1,Terrible Documentation,"Physically attractive, with many interesting features, the Zen suffers from serious limitations. Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment."
1,"ZEN Looks Good, But Is Bad!","This unit looked good, had great looking and easy to use software, but there is one biggggg problem:The device continously wanted to ""re-build"" the library structure and regularly locked up on me. The reset hole is so small, a regular paper clip would not fit in. I had to use a straight pin, but I think that after a few resets, the pin did sme damage to the button.I returned it to Amazon and am awaiting a credit on my account."
3,"Good, but...","I like Creative Players. Good price, good sound. I like this one, but I don't like the navigation joystick (if you have big fingers it's a little difficult to use it).I'm a GNU-Linux user too and to use this player on it, you have to install some extra libraries (and not always work with Amarok)"
2,Creative Zen - Not very USer friendly,I had to return it after 2 days of trying - It just kept hanging - The buttons and the body finish was very cheap - plastic like - and they did not repond correctly - A very bad product.
2,Not worth the money,I purchased the 4G Creative Zen V Plus two years ago. It was not as user friendly as other MP3 players. It froze on me twice: couldn't turn it off or use any functions. I sent it back to the manufacturer and it was either repaired or replaced. I couldn't tell the difference. It worked for another few months and then it froze again. I was done. I do not recommend this product and have replaced it with another make.
2,Good player but backlight burned out within 3 weeks,This is my second Zen Plus. The first one I used for over a year and still works. I bought a second with more memory but the backlight burned out within 3 weeks and it is nearly unusable.
1,Disposible PMP,"I purchased a Zen V 4 GB In February, it has now died in October. So I have had 9 months of use for my money, all the time carrying a paper clip in my wallet to reset this buggy player. I would urge anyone considering buying this product to go to eBay and do a search for ""Zen V as is"", and then search under completed items to see all of the non-functioning Zens that are for sale for parts. I really did enjoy the Zen V when it was working properly (great for audio books except for Netlibrary's long files), but it's freezing problems and short life make it a poor value. It looks like there will be a Cowon D2 in my future, no more Creative."
1,"It Didn't Work, and Now I Have to Pay","So, my Zen V Plus did not work right out of the box. I did what Tech Support told me to, and still it did not work.Now I have to return it, and guess to has to pay to ship it there? That's right, me. Creative makes a crappy product, and when it does not work, I get stuck with the trouble and expense of returning it to them.During my research to fix this problem I came across other people who have the same glitch as I do, so apparently this is not a one-time-only deal.Buyer beware!"
4,Very Nice Little Gadget,"I bought this MP3 player for my wife after owning the 30GB Creative Zen Vision:M for a year. I am a fan of Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer."
1,No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back,"Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand."
2,Creative doesn't seem to like their customers,"I've only had it 24 hours and I'm already disappointed. The documentation is minimal, and what exists is scattered around in web pages, 2 printed booklets, and a PDF file installed deep within the program files folder on your PC, so there's no single source for basic documentation. Support is available through email. (The site says to check your manual for a 24-hour phone number, but the manual says to their web site.)The CD ripper that comes with the player does NOT rip to MP3 format. Apparently, they used to charge you $10 to be able to do that, but now all you get is sent to a dead link on their web site.There's a discussion forum if you're interested in workarounds.All in the all, the device itself is perfectly adequate compared to its competition, but given all the negatives, you might as well buy a comparable brand that's much more customer-friendly."
1,DON'T BUY,"This player worked ok for about 3 weeks - just occasionally freezing. Then it started freezing several times a day, and the cursor would scroll down any menu without anyone touching the toggle switch. I couldn't choose any selection with the toggle because the cursor wouldn't stay on a selection. I returned it to Amazon & they exchanged it. They were great! Amazon's return department gets 5+ stars. The new player was fine for about 4 weeks & now it's again freezing constantly, but the reset button won't work. To reset, you have to let the battery run down fully, then recharge. It's really a shame, because when it's working it's a neat little player."
1,Poor Deal,"Worked great for a couple of weeks but now the firm ware quit working. This product is now not supported by Creative any more!First Amazon product to not work, all other products have been GREAT."
1,"second time around, same problems","I had the same exact creative mp3 player previously but dropped it and got a second one. I like the first and second ones for the same reasons. Small, fairly easy to use and great for when I run. But, I freaking hate them and would not recommend this version and possibly all creative mp3s. Why? Because both would randomly freeze up or start skipping from song to song, volume would go all the way up or go all the way down and then sometimes it would skip from song to radio back to a different song to radio. I click the reset button and sometimes it would work for week and sometimes it would need to be reset 2 or more times. I'm just about ready to pitch this one and get an entirely different mp3 player. I hate to spend this much money on them and then end up with crap. I had both for longer than a year so no warranty or anything. Don't do it. If this only happened to the one, then fine but both are twitchy."
2,Not Reliable,"I purchased two Zen V Plus and both freeze quite often and have to be reset. The 4gb one screen has gone blank and this product is only 6 months old. If I had known I was going to have this much trouble with these units, I would have purchased cheaper products. I thought I could trust Creative Labs products. I've tried the online fixes and will send this product back to Creative Labs (for a fee of course) and I will post the results."
2,Good product except freezed in a week,"This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player."
1,"Display went black, terrible warranty support","Bought for my daughter in Sept but display began fading after a couple months and finally died in December. Annoying that it lasted just past the 30 day Amazon return, but not much more. Per Creative the cost is $25 non-refundable for ""labor"" diagnosing returns.That is outrageous! Over %25 of product cost for them to make it right (assuming they honor the warranty). Due to the lack of medium term reliability with the added insult of paying for warranty service, I will never buy another Creative product."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this because I didn't want to give in to the ipod monopoly. I was excited about the fm radio, but you rarely get reception. The organizer is just a waste of space. I never could figure out how to set the clock on it. But for about a year,it played back my music which is really why I bought it. Then the screen went out and I could only play the last album I listened to over and over. I downloaded updates and the recovery tool from Creative, but nothing worked and eventually the player stopped working all together. What a waste of money. And even though I didn't want an ipod, every accessory out there is designed with an ipod in mind. Sometimes, you just have to give in."
4,Creative Zen V Plus 4 gb,"I've had this player for three months and it has never frozen on me. This is my first MP3 player and so far, I am very pleased with it. Using the software to rip CDs was pretty easy and intuitive. Making playlists using the software was easy. The sound quality is quite good, in my opinion. The headphone shape could be better (they have a tendency to fall out of my ears if I try to walk around with them on). I haven't tried to put video on this, so I don't know how easy that is yet. I have downloaded some Zencasts, and that was easy. However, I do think people should know that they are very unlikely to be able to put 2,000 songs on this player - I believe 1,000 is the maximum one could put on this."
1,charging from ac or car doesn't work,"This is a neat little device and i would rate it highly, except I purchased a charger for it and it will not charge except through the USB connection. This is a fatal flaw for me."
2,Too many resets,"Product has some very good pointes. I like the size, capacity is sufficient, light, the interface is pretty good. However, the frequent reset cancels out all of its good points.I have to reset it a couple of times every hour. I got to the point where I taped a pin to the back so I will be able to reset it where ever I go. The support site only tells you how to reset with no other advice.I'm looking to buy another player but don't think I can buy another of these."
3,"GREAT DEAL AND PRODUCT, BUT FROZE ALREADY?","This product has been great since I have owned it for about a month. Once I figured out how to use it and get it all set up with my computer and a music-to-go site it has been great. It just froze on me completely though and I am hoping it is just a firmware upgrade that is needed, had to restart the whole thing loosing all the music and pictures that I have put on. I'll be keeping my figures crossed that that fixes it! Overall, it is a good product, and at a great price at that."
3,Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Portable Media Player,"This was my third purchased item thru Amazon. I am totally satisfied with the service aand delivery. I reviewed the Zen product prior ro buying dur to it's high rating. Since the purchase, I have had to reset the device three times after it wouldn't power up. Researching the WEB, I found similar problems experienced by other owners of the device. Many were able to have it replaced under waranty. This, in my opinion, is beyond Amazon's control. What I found out, throuogh my own trouble shooting, if I removed the ear plugs from the plug point while the device was playing I would get an system trunoff and then be on able t power it on. Resetting the device brought it back. Now I make sure the device is shutdown prperly before disconnecting the ear plug cable. Overall, I extremely satisfied with my Amazon experience and pleased with both purchases."
3,Save your money and get the regular Zen V. The V Plus isn't that great for videos.,"It's a nice gadget. I love it for music. The screen is very clear and easy to read in all but direct sunlight.The problem is with video. A typical movie will use up 2GB to 3GB. There is simply no way around this due to the fact it does not read compressed video formats.Also, even if you can spare 2GBs for a movie, good luck trying to convert a DVD into a format this player will use. Even better, how about downloading a movie from any of the vendors endorsed by Creative? Guess what - none of them support the Zen V Plus!!!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I am very disappointed in this player from Creative. I own the Muvo Tx Fm by creative, and I love that player. The fidelity of the sound is incredible. The reason I did not go with another Muvo is because I needed more space so the 4gb zen v was the player I chose. Well, this player is cute and the ease of use is great, but that is where my infatuation ends. I found that a lot of my music sounds distorted when there are any bass notes played! I have changed the EQ settings over and over and it is horrible!!! I even tried just turning the EQ off. The sound was very hollow! I hate the sound on this machine!! I wish they had kept the type of sound they created on the Muvo for this player. I am contemplating sending it back for this reason alone."
4,Good Product,"Works well, but should come with a charger!Also, if your main focus is to watch videos, look elsewhere. The screen is small and the battery runs down quickly when playing videos.But, for music playback, it works fine, was worth the money."
4,Mini Jukebox,This product was more than I expected. It holds just about all off my CD collexction with room to spare. Very easy to operate. The only problem That I had was setting up the radio stations.
4,zen player,I am very pleased with the service I have recently recieved from Amazon. I didn't recieve my Zen player and Amazon sent out another one. Thank you so much. I am going to give it to a my daughter for Christmas so after Christmas I will let you know how good the zen player is. Again thank you so much for your assistance.
1,Buy the extended warrenty,I've had this player for 3 months and have already had it replaced twice - screen goes black. Makes it hard to use the player
4,All You Need.,"I agree with all the other positive comments about this player. The only thing I would caution someone about is the little ""joystick"" that is used to navigate. Over time it will most likely wear out because I had a another similar product and the same type of ""joystick"" navigator wore out. Other than that this is a good buy for the money and it is very easy to use."
2,"Broken Power switch, Freezes","I got my Zen V Plus about 3 weeks ago and if froze a few times the first couple of days. I downloaded firmware and it has only frozen up twice since then while I was trying to bookmark a book which is very difficult.Yesterday the power switch fell off and is lost and I have been trying all day to get a response from their customer support by e mail and phone. All I have been able to get is a auto response via e mail that says they will respond within 24 hours. I was never able to hold long enough to get to speak to anyone in their customer service dept. The player has great sound, poor battery life, freezes often and seems to be poorly constructed. I wish I had shopped around a little more."
1,big problems,"My wife and I both bought a Zen device. we liked them for the first 3 months. Then, within weeks, the headphone jack of both of the players shorted out.I tried to contact customer service but after spending hours trying to reach them through the internet, through their call-in numbers, and even by mail, I could reach no customer service person nor get anything but an automated response with help topics that had nothing to do with my problem.I was very disappointed."
3,Creative Zen V Plus,The ZEN V has a lot of nice features and is easy to setup. The software package that is included is designed well. The iPod's don't have as many features but are built much better. The Zen V's plastic casing has a cheap feel to it compared to the iPod's.
2,"Good sound, but it died before it was a year old!!","This Zen V was the first Mp3 I have owned. I found the software not intuitive at all, and had to reset the device frequently, and it was nearly impossible to delete content after it was placed on the device. This is bothersome when you listen to audiobooks. I could live with those faults. The sound quality is decent and my money was already spent, so I was not unhappy. However, when the device died at about month 9, due to a known ""red screen"" manufacturing fault, I was done with Creative.I found out about the known defect but unless you have the original receipt, the company will not replace the defective device. The product was registered with the company at the time of purchase but they still will not replace it. With this lack of customer service, I'll spend my money elsewhere and will recommend that other do as well."
1,Stay away,"I have bought several of these units and in each and every instance they have failed after a few months.They haven't failed because of abuse. They were all gently used, strictly to listen to audio books.Once a unit fails it is a hassle to return for an exchange, through Creative Labs."
2,Works Just Fine... Until It Doesn't,"I bought the Zen V Plus because I wanted a player that could also record, something the iPods don't let you do. I discovered that it records at such a puny sound level that it's of very little use. That was fine, I still had a good mp3 player. But nope. After a few months, it suddenly locked up: none of the buttons would work. Not even the power button! There was no way to turn it off, and the battery wound down to nothing. Connecting it into my computer was no help, because the computer couldn't detect it. Creative's website has no troubleshooting tips, and neither does the owner's manual, so when your Zen Plus dies, it's gone, along with your money. I'll never buy anything from Creative again."
5,Outstanding!,"This product is excellent in terms of form and function. It is so cool looking! I love it! And, it is easy to download music, etc. easy to use and the website has all the information one could ever need to learn how to use it. Customer Service via email and phone is available should one need their direct help."
3,"Easy, one-handed player","This product from Creative is very easy to use. I downloaded 795 songs in a short afternoon from my PC which I needed to do for my trip. Needed to download the newer version. Listened to many of my songs on the plane, sounds just great. The real test will begin shortly as I am going to the Arctic Circle. Loaded with many features and I like that it fits into my coin pocket on my jeans. So far so good. I can give a much better review in about a month. The price is definitely right. MGhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBNXX2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,"Great features, BUT","This little player has many good things going for it. I like the controls better than Ipod, and the radio function is excellent. The problem is that it freezes at seemingly random times. It is easily reset, but there seems to be a limit to the number of times this can be done. My unit froze permanently after four months of use. I would not buy another of these."
1,A Nightmare!,"I did read the reviews on Creative and this player, and thought I was getting a good deal when I bought it. The player was less than 3 month old when it started to freeze up and all the resets and software downloads Creative directed me to, did not fix the problem. I want to send it back to them as it is still under warranty but I cannot read the serial number on the product so they will not accept it. I am going to buy an Apple iPod - should have done that in the first place."
2,Best can turn to worst!,"When I got the ZEN, it was great but some times it would freeze.then after about a year, the screen turned orange! And now I can see anything on the screen!....When downloaded some music and then listend to it THE SONG WEREN'T ON THERE, AND OTHER SONGS OF MINE WEREN'T ON IT EITHER!!!!I don't no if it was just mine or everyone's but if it I know not to buy this product anymore!:("
3,creative zen v plus,"my public library provides recorded books that can be downloaded to my computer and then to an mp3 player that is wma compatible. when this was first available, the existing players did not bookmark, so they were useless for listening to recorded books. recently, i checked and found many players now include this feature. i chose the creative zen v plus. it has 10 bookmarks and excellent sound. the instructions are all but useless. there is no on-line tech support, nor is there a telephone number. it took me more than a few days to figure out how to use it, to download, bookmark, fast forward, rewind and delete."
1,ATTENTION!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL BREAK WITHIN 6 MONTHS. THE SCREEN WILL JUST DIE AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO FIX IT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT OR NOT, IT WILL JUST NATURALLY BREAK. IT IS SOMESORT OF PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS MP3. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MP3 IF YOU BUY IT. BUY AN IPOD, SANSA, A ZUNE, IT DOES NOT MATTER, AS LONG AS IT IS NOT THIS. ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY CREATIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE I ALSO BOUGHT HEADPHONES THAT DID NOT WORK. I REPEAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK. THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN TO ME, IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, AND DOZENS OF REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ ONLINE. THE ZEN V PLUS WILL WORK FOR ABOUT 6-12 MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT THE SCREEN WILL COMPLETLY BREAK AND THE PLAYER WILL STOP WORKING. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN MP3. PLEASE PICK A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR."
1,Half a product in the box,"I purchased this product specifically to be able to download audio books from the library, as well as listen to music. The Zen V Plus is one of the few MP3 players with that capability.1st problem - the instruction manual is over 60 pages, 12 in English. None of which give adequate instruction on loading music into the player.2nd problem - it is incompatible with Windows Vista.I sent an email to tech support. Received a quick & complete reply. I was told that I needed to download 4 applications (99 Meg) to make the unit compatible with Vista, to be able to download audio books & manage files.In addition I was directed to a website to gain instruction on ""How To"" download music & audio books.I believe that a ""complete"" product should be shipped when it is sold. This one is sold as a music/audio book player with voice recorder & picture viewing. I think Creative should be ashamed to put it on the market."
1,don't buy if you expect it to work,"I bought this for myself, and the very same day I bought it, I was scrolling through my list of songs and it froze. I waited a minute, then tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't even do that. When I returned it that night, the light was still on. I couldn't figure out how to get the battery out, either. Getting songs on it was easy, but mine wouldn't create playlists without putting all of the songs in that entire section (album/artist) all on the playlist instead of a single song like I was trying to do. Apparently I'm not the only one with a messed up version of this product, so I'd highly recommend getting something else such as a SanDisk. I currently own the SanDisk e250 and love it."
3,Does not support folders,"This player does not support browsing by folders, which makes it a pain if you have a bunch of miscellaneous mp3s. Also, there is no option to make it continue on to play the next album when it finishes one; it just goes back and repeats. No speed scroll capability. I think the firmware on the Zen Nano was designed better than this one's."
2,Not Pleased,"I bought this product before reading the reviews and ran into some of the same problems that others faced. After about a week my player froze and I had to return it. I got a replacement but because I was out of the country I was unable to return the defective one in time. I had to pay for both and now I am stuck with two. Fortunately for me the original one started working again after the battery went flat and was recharged so I am going to give that away and hope that it continues to work. As a plus though, it has a very good sound when it funtions properly, could have gotten a higher rating from me if I did not have that bad experience."
1,Be Warned!!,This was a great player while it lasted. I had it for around six months then it died. So be warned!!! It seems as though there are way too many people who have had this same experience. If you are looking for something that lasts you might want to try something else.
4,Nigh-perfect Handheld,"I got this mp3 a couple years back now and it has been a simple and reliable device in all that time. The interface is easy, though the scrolling could be a bit faster. The screen is bright but forget about seeing it in sunshine. It's light for its size and has a lovely finish. I'm quite fond of the microphone as well. There was some worry a couple months back when my Zen would not boot up all the way, I feared something nasty had happened to it, then found out later that the player has a recovery mode (hold play while turning on) that was able to fix the problem and it's as good as new now. The thing I love most about it is how it fits in the hand, almost like a perfectly substantial hotel soap. Very nice player."
2,Zen V Plus 4 GB Portable Media Player,"This is my fourth media player purchase in the past year. The Zen V Plus like most other media players is fickled and not very durable. This one failed to power up after only six weeks of nominal use with proper handling and no droppage. Never load the company software that comes with the product, they are normally poor and the product should run off the media program in the computer (i.e. Windows Media Player)anyway. These products are designed for younger teens who will continue to purchase these items regardless of their performance. With the advancement of cell phones these type products are destined for extinction soon. And not too soon for me."
1,"had to send back, very disappointed","My Creative Zen V Plus would never get out of ""Recovery Mode."" I upgraded the firmware, but that didn't help. The email support was pretty lame (Me: ""My product is stuck in Recovery Mode""; Them: ""Here's how to access Recovery Mode""). I finally got a human being to respond by email, and they sent me an RMA # to return the product. I've spent many hours now troubleshooting, emailing, repacking, and now I'll have to make a trip to UPS to ship it back, at my own expense. Who knows what they'll send back to me and if that will work."
3,Great Value But Average Performance,"Very nice little MP3 player for a 4GB player, but the sound quality is only average. My old player is louder and clearer than this one, but with true surround sound ear pods the difference isn't as bad. Thats my only gripe about this player...the sound quality is only average."
1,Waste of money!,pfft. waste of money. i loved it until my screen faded and consequentally went BLACK after 5 months rendering it USELESS.
2,Long-time Creative user,"I've had a Jukebox Zen Xtra for years and it hasn't had any serious problems. But I got the Zen V plus for Christmas and it froze up after a few days of use. Everytime you turn it on it just freezes and has to be reset. I took it back and exchanged it for another, and I didn't even get to play 2 songs on it before it froze up the same way. I've tried everything I can think of.This would be a good player if it worked. Creative makes some nice products, but this is not one of them in my opinion."
1,"Keep on looking, this MP3 player needs to be renovated","We liked this product until after a few hours after we got it, it stopped working and froze. The reset button did not work. When searching the net for answers, I found many instances where others had the same problem. It was not Amazons fault but the Creative company who needs to do some tweaking on their product."
1,"Little player, little enjoyment","If I had to do it again, I'd spend a little more and get an iPod.Extremely low output when used as AUX with stereo systems. My screen kept getting dimmer and dimmer until it went completely black, luckily within the warranty period of 3 months. Creative was not horrible to deal with from customer service stand point, but is that why you'd buy a player? I'd rather have one that doesn't require additional work in a few weeks.Not bad for using around town, workouts or even on the slopes, but don't expect this to be the best of what's available."
3,"Great device, Zero service","I really enjoy the ZEN V Plus, but don't try to find any answers to questions on their web site. You will go in circles. I would give the device about 4.5 stars, and service a zero. If you click on the ""Contact Us"", it takes you back to looking through their archive of answers. The only way to contact them, as far as I can see, is to comment on their web site. OTOH, they don't seem to care enough to get back to you even then. BTW, you apparently cannot copy FROM the Zen V Plus TO your hard drive. When I try, it disallows it. That's available even on the super-cheap MP3 players."
1,so many flaws,"ok, first of all it could be a good product, but it has too many flaws. i have have my player for about 1 year, like other people stated, it freezes, then you have to wait until the battery goes dead then recharge it, it reboots on it's own, etc, but the final straw is my player screen started to go out, first weird lines came across the screen, then after 2 days the screen disappeared completely, good thing i know how to work it because im going to use this thing to it wont play no more, i paid 200 bucks when it first came out. just be weary of this player. i wish i read reviews back then."
1,complete waste,"At first it did everything I wanted. It was a nice little player that Ihad no problem putting music, pic etc. Then randomly the whole screen just went black. If you look on creatives site and other boads. This is a common problem.I returned it and now Im trying the samsung YP...hopefully I'll have better luck."
4,Important Background on the BCP,"A good overview of the Book of Common Prayer - both history and usage. The BCP is the base prayer book for the Episcopal Church, and the Anglican tradition generally. First written in the 1500's, it has evolved over time as the Church has evolved. However, the book itself forms the format and basis for worship for the Anglican churchgoer. Where the Anglican tradition appears to be relatively flexible on dogmatic theology, the Church seems very firm on the form and format of worship as contained in the BCP. Jeffery Lee discusses the controversies and issues that have arisen over the 450 years that the BCP has been in use, and discusses the historical, ancient, elements and traditions contained in the BCP. If you are new to the Episcopal Church or want to understand the Anglican tradition better, this book is critical to understanding the what and why of the BCP and the form of worship."
1,TV flicker a lot DONT BUY,"After 2 weeks this TV flicker a lot. Philips has a poor customer service. I had to file a complaint to corporate just to get a respond. After long 6 month they replace, but the new TV still flicker with DVD & Cable box. If anyone have the same problem please call corporate Exec. Mr. Dominique Magic @ 1-877-293-0903"
1,Horrible TV and the Customer Service,"I have purchased a Philips 37 inch LCD from Best Buy and i purchasedthe warranty with it and within 6 months the TV would not power on. Icontacted Best Buy and they reffered me to the Allens TV and the TV waspicked up by Allens TV for Repair and the TV has been in for repair for60 days and still they have no clue whats going on. I purchased theBest Buy Performance Service Plan and still everytime i talk to Best Buy,they only thing they have to say is Sorry. I am really frustrated asBest Buy has been very unhelpful in resolving the issue and putting anypressure on the Service Station. The service center had hard time figuring part for this TV. They have ordered part 3 times and it would not work. Still i am waiting for my TV back. This is the second Philips TV i have issues with. I am never buying any Philips Product again.Stay away from Philips Products"
1,Piece of Junk,"Purchased this television in December 2005 and at about the 18 months mark, it died. The not-so-funny thing about this is that it was just out of warranty and the repair company said that it would take approximately $2,100 in new parts to repair (I could buy a brand new version from Costco for $1,200). Apparently Philips LCD TVs are notorious for this kind of thing - bad power supply and internal boards are to blame.The TV gave a beautiful picture and worked flawlessly right up until it failed to turn on one day - purchase one at your own risk."
3,"Nothing new here, but...","One would have thought that after Chubb and Moe's book we would find new insight here; but these writers are not only not economists, but are generally 'conservative' in the sense that they simply won't admit that impoverished kids are desperate for better schools. This book is somewhat closed-minded, but there are valuable lessons to be learned as well. Those who seek profit in education are the vultures who await perched upon the current debate. But things are indeed desperate, and these troublingly complacent academics are not helping things, in my opinion. Worth a read, to be sure..."
1,used for fleas,"I bought this as it was stated that it would kill all fleas in the house, what I mess, the dust gotall over the furniture and had to be almost washed all, it could not just be wiped off. and worstit did not kill the fleas. at my house anyway"
4,Results from diatomac earth,I used this product on four cats and four dogs. All visible worms were gone within about a week. I have two finicky eaters so it has been a chore to get it into food that they would eat. The worst side effect has been that of hard stools for all. I have used pumpkin and oat bran for that. I have had terrible problems with worms even using revolution and the wormers has been hard.Diatomaceous Earth(food grade)is cheap compared to the wormers. I also have one female cat on magnesium low food for kidney infections. All animals seem to have tolerated the product well. I would like to have been told to put on goggles as no matter how careful you are it gets in your eyes. It doesn't seem to hurt them but just annoying. If you don't put on goggles have a eye wash ready or some solution for dry eyes. Great product despite the few problems I have had.
4,"Natural way of getting rid of fleas, ants, etc.","I sprinkle the cat food that I feed 2 ferals with DE. I also take it myself because it can be taken by humans. I don't notice an effect on me. On the ferals, well the white cat used to have redness around the ears and eyes and nose, and that seems to have disappeared. I also sprinkle it where I see ants and they stay away from that area where I sprinkled the powder. I also sprinkle it on their beds. If you will use it on your pets, then you will be able to tell whether it drives the fleas away."
3,Diatomaceous Earth,"Not a bad product, but, as with any powder washes away when it rains. On the plus side It temporarily rids the yard of fleas & ticks without poisoning the pets."
3,flea killing,"I'm sure that I must have been doing something incorrectly, but I had researched this item and thought it would be good for killing fleas on my cats. As far as I can tell, it didn't do much. I still had to spend money on a brand name flea killer(which also worked very slowly). maybe Someone else will have better luck with this. I received it very quickly...no complaints about the seller!"
1,terrible mess - didn't work,I tried this for bedbugs. Did not help in the slightest. But did create a terrible mess - and ruin my vacuum when I tried to clean it up. My daughter had a similar experience - using this to get rid of fleas.What we both finally found did help - is a steam cleaner. Mine is very expensive (from allergybuyersclub) - but it not only got rid of the bugs - but got my rugs and floors almost like new!
2,it was ok,i thought the product was just ok...it did cut back on bugs but did not get rid of them at all.
4,Diatomaceous Earth,"Everything went fine: quick delivery, product OK, only packaging of product not great - plastic bag, easy to spill once opened. Otherwise good value. Tx."
1,Doesnt work,"Read on-line that this product helps to kill worms and keep animals from getting them. I have now used all but 5% of this bag and it has worked on helping NOTHING! Maybe this item is good for other things, but not for getting rid of worms in puppies."
3,havnt used much,I havent used much but i did spread it all over my carpet and man could you see the fleas jumping around! bad thing is in vacumming up all of the dust the vaccum got clogged over and over and it was a pain will not do that again but wil uset he rest in my yard and plants when spring comes :)
5,works great,"Kills fleas on my kitty cats, and it is supposed to be good for them if they eat it as well."
4,Flee control,"So far it's reducing the flee population with weekly use on furnature and carpets combined with regular vacuuming and cat washing. Had a much better effect than borax and is safer for the animals. After a topical flee treatment burnt hair off my cat and caused sever allergic reactions, diotamatious earth seem to be the best safe treatment for my flee problem."
2,Not idiot proof like a crock pot,"I've tried chicken wings, turkey breast, ribs, and a roast, each prepared to time specifics in the guide that came with the product. Each meal has been an utter disaster! My experience with each meat is that it gets extremely dried out, unlike the description that cooking on low gives the meat a tender, juicy effect. Quite the opposite. I would buy this product if you consider yourself a chef. Otherwise, I might think twice."
2,Indoor BBQ,"The indoor BBQ is more like a slow cooker. It takes hours to prepare a meal. It is not made to cook hamburgers,hot dogs or steaks and does not provide the outdoor BBQ flavor. I would not recommend this product."
4,Barbecue crock pot,"This was a Father's Day gift for my husband who is a very talented cook. The ribs that he prepared using the barbecue crock pot turned out very well. They were tender and the meat fell off the bone. A word of advice, please be sure to wear protective gloves when opening the crock pot since the temperature of the steam generated by the crock pot, can be quite high."
4,Love it!,"Shortly after receiving the BBQ pit we cooked a rack of ribs. We used one of the rubs that was recommended in the book that came with it. They were delicious and very tender. Since it was winter, we put the BBQ pit on a counter top and the smell filled the house. I see several people here have complained about clean up, but we soaked the pan and grills in hot soapy water for a couple hours and had no problems. This weekend we're cooking a whole chicken. Freeing up space in the oven is another plus."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this with great anticipation. A rib cooker, with a crockpot included--a multi-use product. I have a small kitchen, so I wanted something that would function in several different ways. I am disappointed in the Crockpit. Yes, it cooks ribs to ""very tender."" My oven does that, too. As a crockpot, it leaves a great deal to be desired, because the temperature is not low enough and the seal is not good enough. The few things I've cooked (pork roast, beef short ribs, sauerkraut and kielbasa) have been fully cooked in less than half the time it used to take in my old, now-dead Rival crockpot. And it dries things out, too.It is huge, and takes up half a cupboard shelf in my kitchen.I think it's going to the rummage sale. I am looking for another crockpot today, as a matter of fact."
4,BBQ is so EASY,"I bought my husband the BBQ Pit for Christmas. He is a BBQ master and we have BBQ all year, despite the temperature outside. It was lovely to go out all day and enter the house and smell the wonderful aroma of ribs cooking, ready after cooking all day in the BBQ Pit. The meat fell off the bone and melted on my tongue. I washed the pit afterwards. We had oiled the metal first with cooking oil and clean up was no harder than any other pan that had cooked meat. We cooked our ham in it on Christmas day and I think I let it cook too long. So far we believe the pit to be a winner. I would have preferred a timer so it would switch off automatically. You have to have a place to store it inbetween using it and its rather large. We put it ontop of the fridge. It's a good idea and we look forward to cooking a roast in it. Any fool can BBQ cooking with it and you'll be impressed with it afterwards. I recommend putting some water in the bottom during cooking, to help with cleanup."
5,CAREER COACH RECOMMENDS CAREER COACHING YOUR KIDS,"If I were to write a book on career coaching for kids, it would be EXACTLY like this. The authors have done a wonderful job in creating a book that is not only useful, but thought provoking for parents. It had me sold when they talked about following the lead of the child and feeding their interests. It seems simple enough, but when parents (naturally) view their children as extensions of themselves, it poses a significant challenge for many. With well-written wisdom that will benefit parents with kids of all ages, I highly recommend this book. The price here on Amazon practically makes it free. Get it today!"
1,STAY AWAY - COMPLETE GARBAGE,This unit is exactly as the other 2 described.. just wish I'd seen them before I bought this crap at home depot. Thanks a lot... it doesnt work AT ALL. Light just stays on and I followed all directions and it's only 10 feet from the sending unit. Complete and utterly worthless.. couldn't be more irritated.
3,Decent player,"All-in-all this is a decent mp3 player. It does everything that I need it to do. The sound quality isn't bad at all. There are only 2 complaints that I have. 1: The battery life isn't that good. 2: It takes quite a while to switch songs because the player has to load all the song info before it can switch songs, turn up the volume, stop the song, or pause the song. But for the price and the amount of storage one can get out of it, I would say it is a pretty good buy."
1,Unreliable product and bad customer service,"Surprisingly or not, I had the very same experienceAs Mr James Hughes above. I bought my player from EBAY.I was brand new, I've charged it and listened. It sounds great and even pushed my HD600 very good. But, when I've tried coping song to it, the transfer was very slow (60 minutes for a song???) and most of the time the USB connection was broke. The HD was making sounds like a DEAD pc HD. Tried it on my laptop, and still the same problem.I've contacted the customer service, and they told me to send it to them for repair. I've waited for 6 weeks until it was send back, spent half a day at the Israeli customs (because the guys from France didn't mentioned it was a repaired product) and got home just to find out it has the same problem.Now I'm looking for a new player. Obviously it will not be an Archos."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back. I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products."
2,A little disappointing...,"I found this book a little disappointing. There are a lot of recipes in this book that call for vegan cheese. My kids don't like vegan cheese. I'm trying to find more creative recipes that do not depend on meat substitutes. One funny thing, there is actually a recipe for a whole carrot placed on a hot dog bun as a substitute hot dog! That is what people who make fun of vegetarians imagine we are feeding our kids every night! I would recommend ""Vegan with a Vegeance"" over this book."
5,Brown Clogs,The shoes are very comfortable and of high quality. The price was great and the delivery time was minimal. I would absolutely order from this site again.
4,madness visited,"What is it like to go mad? What is really going on in a psychotic's mind? I don't know from experience(I hope) but vicariously felt what it may be like through this book. The description of what is actually going on in the plot, and how it is understood by the main character, felt very understandable. Reading this book is no picnic, but it is unforgettable and poignant."
2,Falling short of expectations,"The characters are stereotypical, and the dialogues lack power. The languge is remarkably barren... Although this book follows the tradition of Kafka, Nabokov, and Dostoevsky, in my opinion, it cannot appear on the same list."
3,Difficult,"Canetti's prose is difficult to read in English. The translation is a little wooden, and you have to devote your concentration to the structure of the sentences more than you would, have you been reading a native Anglo-Saxon author. Snip: (...)"
1,blah,"Dont buy this book.I am very disappointed.It is a waste of time and money, what is more important?"
4,A Nightmare,"The first part of the book reminded me of some familiar dark comedy, maybe an early Nabokov or the neglected American author Russell Greenan. In the second part, our protagonist leaves his bookish sanctuary for a series of delusional misadventures, accompanied by a differently delusional dwarf, who almost seemed to be a parody of Sancho Panza. The third part introduces the protagonist's brother, a seemingly rational pychoanalyst with much more functional delusions of gradeur.No one should expect a happy ending from this dark comedy. If anything, it makes the point stunningly that each of us is trapped in his or her own absurd states of misinterpretation of the world and the others we encounter and that cruelty and disregard of humanity seems to be unavoidable.This book, for some reason, gave me a few nightmares, so I guess it must have been worth the time to read it."
5,Beautiful!,"Offend anyone with with George's outlook about disease, religion, even children! It's by far his best album yet, but hey- that's what's great about George Carlin--- he keeps getting better and better."
3,I know there is a joke here somewhere,"Too bad the jokes on you. Chances are, if you have a pulse, George has something against you. Don't get me wrong, this disc has it's moments, just not enough. Some of it reminds me of banter I said with my buddies when I was 12, and other parts of it are Bill Hicks rants. Very preachy in his own way, yet prophetic in his views on terrorism. He basically explains how to do it, and it's eery to think that this was how it was actually carried out on the 2nd Tuesday of September in 01. He also foretells of the collapse of the US economy, if only he were here to laugh at us (I know he is somehow). There are a few really good laughs here, and Carlin makes several good points. It just makes me wonder if I want an alcoholic cokehead who seems bitter about growing up Catholic telling me how to live my life and judging me. Nah..."
3,He has had better but not bad,George Carlin on this CD seems to be yelling mindlessly about stupid stuff like Cigars and Angels. He has had much better work on Back in Town and on Jammin in New York (his best Cd I must say) If you can borrow this from a friend and judge for yourself. I will be seeing a Carlin performance tonight and I hope its better than this. But overall it does have its highlights like advertising lullibye and there is no god. But try to borrow it from a friend instead of wasting seventeen bucks like I did
2,social commentary without the humor,"I have all of Carlin's albums, since I enjoy both his light-hearted observations of life's little moments and his scathing social criticism. I agree with most of his points on YOU ARE ALL DISEASED, but he's just not funny on this album. Carlin's attempts at humor here lie primarily in the exaggerations he uses when complaining about things, not in the subtle asides he mixes in with the complaints, as he did in BACK IN TOWN and JAMMING IN NEW YORK. The first time I heard YOU ARE ALL DISEASED, I didn't have a hearty laugh until halfway through the record. As I said before, I agree with most of his opinions here, but -- for humor -- on this album George is at the least creative and laziest point in his career."
2,Not the George I Used to Know,"Like many people, I have been a George Carlin fan for a long time. I have always enjoyed his unique perspective and presentation. However, there is a disturbing trend in Carlin's comedy. George Carlin has shifted from astute observations on the inane events and occurences of our world to a disturbing bitterness that is very hard to enjoy. While at times ""You Are All Diseased"" is interesting and thought-provoking, most of it consists merely of bitter rants and anger. The album's angry mood culminates in the final track in which Carlin curses God. While Carlin has talked about religion before in many fun and interesting ways, he has reached an all time low in this album. If you want George Carlin at his best, look somewhere else. If you want angry bitterness that aims to shock, then this is the album for you."
5,With an edge,"Let me just say that I completely disagree with the folks that say that Carlin turned old and bitter towards the end of his career/life. I say he turned funnier, more aware of the crazy weird world around him, and more mature in his dialogues. I listened to 'Class Clown' recently and it was sophomoric and silly. 'Diseased' (along with all of his newer efforts) has a great bite to the humor and an honesty that you don't get with most other comedians. Carlin tells you how he feels about the mess that is America and doesn't give a damn how you feel about it. I miss him ..."
5,God must be a man,I bought this yesterday and started listening. I just absolutly agree with his complaints on children. I wonder why people want to raise these little sh**s to be yuppies. I also agree with his rant on religion. God must be a man to let alot of these things go on.
3,Disapointing,"I've loved pretty much everything Carlin has done -- but found this CD very disapointing after the the last 3 brilliant albums he has made. The CD is entertaining, its just not very funny or thought provoking. There are some laughs (this is Carlin after all!). However, this time he seems to have left off the joke writing to go with the anger."
5,Warning!!! Biased Review Ahead.,"I'm a BIG George Carlin fan.I pretty much love everything he's done. Not only is he funny but he also gives you something to think about. If your looking for some unbiased, track by track breakdown of this album, you're going to need another reviewer because I'm not that guy. I'm a George Carlin fan plain and simple."
2,Warning!,"TO CARLIN FANS...Do not buy this album. it is his worst one of recent, and one of his worst ever. there is very little humor to be found, he sounds more [...mad] at everyone for everything, and it is just not funny. this cd was a waste of money."
1,Just An Angry Old Man With NOTHING Funny To Say,"This isn't comedy. This is just an old man complaining about america. No laughs here. Just a lot of swearing and cussing for no reason. Horrible get any other George Carlin album, but not this."
2,"all promise, no action","This period was actually extremely fertile for McCartney, but you'd never know it from this collection of tunes. Check out the singles and the accompanying B-sides for the real action...songs like ""Big Boys Bickering"", ""StyleStyle"", ""Sweet Sweet Memories"" and ""I Can't Imagine"" (among others...) For some reason McCartney went for this collection...for the most part lifeless, but (as usual) not without it's highlights. For my money, ""Hope of Deliverance"" ranks up there with the all time great Macca singles, and the two tunes co-written with Mr. Costello are fine as well (though check out the acoustic live duet with Elvis on ""Mistress and Maid"" on the LIPA concert recording for a little perspective on the ""Off The Ground"" version.) Macca is brilliant, but he gets lost amongst the band in this one. His poorest since ""Red Rose Speedway""."
3,nothing groundbreaking here,"The album is ok I guess, but I find the tracks just lack that extra something. I think that Paul reaches true magic when he is solo: listen to 'little willow' or any of the other solo outings on 'flaming pie', they have a kind of organic mellowness to them. Here, he is with a band, and it feels strained and a little artificial in the way he sings. There is a lack of heart in these songs.That being said, there are a few good songs here: 'Golden earth girl' is the one time he records something near beutiful on the album and the oboe/flute (not sure) is excellent. 'The lovers that never were' is nice. But I dislike the tuneless 'get out of my way' and 'biker like an icon' has no melody, similarly 'looking for changes' is overblown and pretentious and irritates me, especially the 'you know what I mean' bits. Overdone and false. I also find 'cmon people' overblown and pompous.Not great."
3,Off the Ground,"Off the Ground being McCartney's 1993 is an ok album but some of the texts are just a bit too political. The lyrics for Looking for Changes is a hoot that talks about animal rights and sounds hokey. Hope of Deliverence is quite a nice track that I remember hearing on the radio back in the day when this album was released. The booklet is a mess filled with shoddy photos, no lyrics but the listing on the back of what each of them play is nice. 3/5."
3,"Gets a Little off the ground, but....","The oddest thing about this album, for me, was that he previewed a bunch of the songs from it on MTV a few weeks before it was released and they were wonderful performances and made me anxious to get the album! Then I got it and--Ooooch, where's the fire?Still a good album and once again, as with ""Flowers In the Dirt"" the Elvis Costello co-writes are my favs.""The Lovers That Never Were"" is my favorite Macca/EC collaboration. ""Hope of Deliverence"" ""Off The Ground"" and the rockin' ""Get Out Of My Way"" are great.Of course my ultimate memory of this album was that on the day I bought it the record store I was in had a shoplifter take off on them and the security guard and I chased and tackled the poor guy in the pouring rain. They were grateful, but, I still had to pay for Paul. ...............................:)"
2,Half-baked Paul,"This is a major disappointment,coming off what was probably Paul's best overall album (Flowers in the Dirt). The voice is in good form, but the material's thin. While the title cut is pretty good and the McCartney/Costello ""The Lovers That Never Were"" is great, the rest of the album is incredibly lame. ""Looking for Changes""---did he really think think was worth putting on the album? Overall,his weakest effort since Wings at the Speed of Sound."
3,Just a few tracks on a par with the Beatles,"I love Paul McCartney and don't want to denigrate his post-Beatles repertoire, but for a Beatles fan searching for solo Beatle material that's worthy of the Beatles, there ain't much here. There's `Biker Like an Icon', but `Paul is Live' has a more energetic, less precious version. And there's `Golden Earth Girl', sort of a companion piece to the Beatles' `Mother Nature's Son' (which was a de facto McCartney solo track). The collaborations with Elvis Costello aren't bad, but are unilikely to be songs you'll want to hear again and again. `Hope of Deliverance' is a bit borderline, but once again, a `live' version on `Paul is Live' is superior. Another borderline case is `Winedark Open Sea', especially if one makes the false ending the real ending."
3,Like a late Wings album,"After the difficulties Paul seemed to have with his albums for a while in the 80s, this album seems more coherent. There is a sense of Paul working well with a group here, and it does give an impression like a Wings album. It does take some listening to appreciate. It seems to denote a new flower power era of some kind hard to define."
5,One of my Favorite CD's,"This really is one of my favorite McCartney solo albums. I really like the rocking nature of the album (different from Flaming Pie in that respect.) I agree with the other review, that the band was tight, really tight, on this one.And, they actually did make another album. It was released in Europe as a promotional 2 CD set (called Off the Ground: Complete Works,) and it includes a couple of live cuts from the Unplugged session (same band) as well as the full length version of Cosmically Conscious. I think this song is Paul's most Beatle-like song in years. If you can't find the double CD set, but enjoy the music on this album, I recommend looking out for the CD singles which do contain the other tracks.All in all, great music, by a great composer/musician."
4,Undiscovered Gem,"I remember a lot of people not liking this album for the exact reasons it's such a strong entry in McCartney's discography--it's an exceptionally clean pop album, perhaps too clean for those who like his more ragged (though no less charming) efforts such as ""Flaming Pie"" or ""McCartney"". What makes this album an even greater effort is the fact that the songs themselves are not lost in the candy-coated mix. There are songs of great substance here, like ""Hope of Deliverance"" and ""Looking for Changes""; there are great rock 'n roll songs, like ""Biker Like an Icon"" and ""Get out of My Way""; and, of course, great McCartney ballads: ""Winedark Open Sea"", ""I Owe it All To You"". This album is a great progression from ""Flowers in the Dirt"". My wish is that Paul would have kept this band together for a few more albums. It's certainly the best group of musicians he's surrounded himself with as a solo artist."
2,"What a disapointment - ""Off The Ground"" & off the charts","Following his ""comeback"" success with ""Flowers in the Dirt"" and the subsequent world tour that followed, Paul should have followed up with an even stronger album.This ain't it.Paul took his new socially/enviromentally conciousnees to the studio...and came out with a vapid, preachy, boring mess.It's not a total loss (no McCartney album ever is). The title track is catchy enough. ""Get Out of My Way"" is a bit of a rocker that came out better live. And I'm kinda fond of ""C'mon People"" in spite of myself. In addition, ""Hope of Deliverence"" is one of his better tunes that should have appeared on ""Flowers...""Paul and his band performs well thruout...it's a shame that the material they were performing was less than memorable.Basicly, this was a ""let's get an album out so we can tour"" thing...the tour was sucessful, the album pretty dismal. For completeists only."
4,"Second Single from ""Off the Ground"" Rocks","The 1993 ""Off the Ground"" album gave Macca his last true international success. It spawned 4 singles, this being the second of them.""Off the Ground"" (5 tracks, 19 min.) starts off with the rocking title track, just great. ""Cosmically Conscious"" is excerpted on the album as the fade-out but featured here in its full version, and a great song. ""Style Style"" is an above-par mid-tempo rocker, and could have easily fitted onto the flow of the album. ""Sweet Sweet Memories"" features great vocal harmonies, another great B-side. ""Soggy Noodle"" is a short guitar instrumental, and unnecessary, frankly.In all, though, this is a great single, and a necessary addition to any Paul McCartney completist."
2,A poor one,"I love Paul McCartney, but this one is quite poor. The songs sound all the same: two chords and that's all. Paul has written great things since he left the Beatles, but they're not in this album!"
3,Not Bad,Looking for Changes ought to be PETA's anthem....that's a great song... it's so funny... it's like every once in a while... Paulwill just churn up a wonderful song making you forget momentarily thatThe Beatles are no more.... and then... he'll slip right back into mediocrity..overall though.... this album has a nice environmenal message andsome interesting song-writing by Paul... I don't recommed it unless you'rea big Paul fan...
2,A STUMBLING ATTEMPT BY MACCA,"With the exception of ""Hope of Deliverence"" and ""Mistress and Maid"", this is typical substandard McCartney material. Some very nice melodies, but weak lyrics(these are the kind of lyrics that John would have gone after Paul about).Not a total loss(that would be WILD LIFE, RED ROSE SPEEDWAY and BACK TO THE EGG), but nothing to get excited about. Paul did this album by route and the songs lack substance(the b-sides from the ""Hope of Deliverence"" single are better than just about everything else on this album!). Paul clearly needed a co-producer that could edit his worst impulses.Not recommended."
4,Better Than Casette,In the Casette I Have of This album There are 10 Minutes empty in Side B(Side of Cam'on People).10 Minutes unprovected That could put in There one or Two Songs More or Change one or two Song from SIDE A To Side B.The CD I Think only Ther are The song but not that Empty Space.
4,A Lost Early 90's Gem,"I heard this album in high school and brushed it off as older McCartney fluff, preferring The Beatles and his 70's stuff. But now having just heard it again it has aged quite well, almost like a fine wine. I remember seeing the ""OFF THE GROUND"" video and that song was and still is the best one. But there are very few fillers here. ""Mistess & Maid"" and ""The Lover's That Never Were""are two other highlights. ""Flaming Pie"" still is his better 90's album but this is a worthy predecessor. So put this album in your cd mix with ""Flaming Pie"", ""Driving Rain"", and ""Chaos And Creation In The Backyard"" and have a Good Time."
5,Great score,"There are some mis-prints, as there often are. I wish I would have bought the hard cover but this is a good value"
3,More used than I'd have liked,"The score had highlighting throughout for a part other than mine as well as markings, but it will serve my purposes."
1,Italian only,"The ""Look Inside"" and other reviews indicate that English is included in this edition but the one I got has only Italian. Sounds like this edition is misrepresented."
1,Get the Dover instead.,"I'm a graduate student in opera conducting. This score is awful. A reprint of a reprint. Time signatures and tempo markings are almost if not completely unreadable. Some pages have the barline running down the entire page despite there being three separate systems. The English is printed ABOVE the Italian, making it difficult to read, and both are in an identical font. In addition, the staves and systems are cramed so close together, there is a LOT of bumping and absolutely NO room for marking of any kind. I will probably buy the Dover/Ricordi editionLa Boheme: Vocal Scoreto replace this - would have already if I weren't on a tight deadline."
1,Terrible waste of money,"This is forty minutes of nothing.I would not recommend this to anyone.One of the biggest thing about this battle is the moving battle theme,that they left out.Don't waste your money.If anyone wants this for free i will even give them the tape for the cost of the shipping."
4,Tripp Lite PR50 Power Supply,"I've been using this product about 3 weeks with no complaints at all. The unit runs a Yaesu FT-950 Ham Radio Transceiver. The unit is rock solid, no voltage sag, no noise, the heat is pronounced, no vibration and no hum. The shipping container is an embarrassment and was damaged. The internal brown packing paper is a joke for a product this heavy. Lastly this one is truly a quality control issue, the rubber feet are missing. I'll contact Tripp Lite and see what gives."
2,Buy an Astron,"So i saved myself 50 bucks of so.If i had to do it again I would get the Astron.It's a fairly noisy,and runs very warm.I keep a cooling fan on it now to keep it cool.I have used Astron's for years and i should have stuck with them."
1,Skim it for free at the library!,"I took this book out from the library, instead of buying it...I would have been really disappointed if I had wasted my money. Right now, I am in the process of applying to law schools and checked out a few books...the ones I plan on buying are ""Law School Confidential"" and ""Planet Law School""...I've also heard really good things about ""Law School Insider"". ""JD Jungle"" is so light weight in comparison. There is nothing new or insightful about this book. The legal pop culture references to television, movies & sensational trials - feel more like name dropping than useful information. Erin Brockovich in a law school guide? C'mon! She's never even gone to law school. Who needs to hear about how well Julia Roberts portrayed her in a law school guide?!? I did find the interview of Justice Stevens insightful...but again not enough to justify buying this book."
2,Survival Guide sinks,"I expected more from JD Jungle. A barebones guide, only sparse and vague advice is given on how to study, how to brief a case, how to outline for exams, and understanding the IRAC procedure. A mere 1.5 pages were devoted to how to ace law school exams, for example. No example cases or practice briefs were provided unlike other law school prep books I have read.The only reason that I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 was the engaging interviews in the last chapter. The chapter is entitled ""Inspiration"" and it did not disappoint.Such legal heavy-weights such as Erin Brockovich, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. are included in this chapter.In sum, I would recommend a different guide. Or, better yet, do it the free way~ online. I have gotten extensive feedback from online law student message boards and online advice columns (such as lawnerds)."
3,Nothing special,I had to get this book for a class but I wouldn't buy it if I did not have to. All of the pictures are in black and white. Netters books are much better!
4,good overview,"Its a great overview of all the major statistical methods used in archaeology to examine data, and the best thing is, its written in plain english for anyone with a bit of mathematical knowledge to understand. And its by far the best one among the bunch of ""statistics"" books in the field. Great value for money, as youll always be going back to it. Great reference material."
3,"Again, good singing, mediocre sound","Gabriela Benackova's silvery soprano and poised dignity make a most moving effect in the title role. Vilem Pribyl's nobly sung Laca and Nadezda Kniplova's raw-voiced but impassioned Kostelnicka are much the same as they were 10 years ago on the Angel set, while Frantisek Jilek conducts the Brno Janacek Opera Chorus and Orchestra in an affectionate reading that accents the score's lyrical as opposed to its melodramatic character. The main problem is the murky sound, which lacks presence and definition."
1,Awful book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was so bad, I thought it was written by a 10 year old. It amazes me that anyone could rate it as a 5. Must be the author writing reviews over and over. I feel sorry for his students."
2,PX4Storm Holster,"I purchased this holster after getting my conceal permit. I was so excited to open this product up and try it on. The first thing was i am so excited. Then i put my gun into it. With or without any ammo in it, I noticed this is not for concealing a pistol. I would have to wear 3 jackets to hide a pistol. This holster fits the gun superb, however if your trying ot keep low key. this is not the product for you. Again it is a great model, great fit, and easy to use... however your not able to conceal a ny wepon with this holster. the fun sits way to high and is too heavy for that."
5,"Great holster, but no so good for CCW in the summer.","This an excellent and very secure holster. My third Fobus and second paddle holster. However, it is not the best for concealed carry wear during t-shirt weather. It prints quite obviously under a t-shirt. But what do expect with a bigger sub-compact like the PX4?"
4,Holster,The screw that allows you to tilt the gun will loosen during use. Other than that it is a great product.
5,Flying into excellent writing...,"Flying Into Limbo was recommended to me and I read it thinking it would be good (since it was recommended)and that it would be about the medical world. It was not only all the above, it was also an excellent study of ethics. I kept asking myself what I would do in the same situation. I could hardly put the book down because I wanted to know how the problems presented would be resolved. I was not disappointed. Marifran Dirkes not only wrote an excellent book, she provided me with characters I really liked and hope to meet again. I was also amazed at the amount of research it took to write this book. Five gold stars to the author!"
3,Wrong tip shown,"The tip shown in the images is incorrect. Product no longer comes with the blunt needle tip which is what you need to get into those tight spaces of the smaller trains. The product now comes with a tapered plastic tip that cannot get the oil where it needs to go. The new tip is worthless. This is a Bachmann packaged product, not sure why they changed tips."
1,BEWARE of the Shipping Charges,You can buy 10 of the pencils for $10 and they'll charge you $45 for shipping!
3,It's okay.,"These eye-liners were okay, but shipping was exhorbitant. They are a nice, true deep color, but for me, they don't sharpen well at all. I would not buy them again, but I have read where some other people like them a lot. I guess it's just a matter of preference. I would not pay this shipping again, and it took too long a time for them to mail them out to me."
1,Sick,"What kind of people set out to create and perpetrate hate of this nature? I have seen this and is is crude, convoluted and false."
2,Not what I expected,"I understood that this was a catalog of movements, but the movements were so exaggerated that I really did not find them to be useful. The performances at the end of the dvd were more like a bellydance fusion and good; unfortunately Im not a fan. This dvd isnt for someone looking for a caralog of dance moves to build into a choreography for oriental dancing. I dont think the movements were helpful. Sorry"
1,Inaccurate and poorly written,"A friend gave me this book b/c I am an art historian who specializes in the Italian Renaissance and b/c I love romance novels. This is an absolute DUD! The writing is terrible and it is full of historial inaccuracies. None of her descriptions of life in 15th c. Florence make any historical sense. I feel like she consulted a junior encyclopedia written in the 1920s for her history, then added the names of some Florentine artists and other personages. I was so disgusted with this that I tried to write my *own* romance set in the Italian Renaissance !! If you want something fun to read before visiting Florence, try Foster's ""Room with a View"" or ""The Agony and the Ecstasy."" The latter is pretty much *pure* fiction, but at least it's fun!"
4,Good Replacement Band,"I purchased this product as a replacement band for a dive watch. It did not fit perfectly and I did not expect it to because it was not intended for my specific watch, but it was pretty easy to cut the band down with a razor blade to make it fit. Once I got it to fit, it went on easily and it has been comfortable to and sturdy."
2,drjec20002chen,"Had to trim the ends of this and then still could not get the band onto the watch. This is a tricky type of band to put on a watch and, although I've been able to change many others bands on other watches over the years, I just couldn't get this one on. Good luck to you if you try."
3,Good band,"Good band, but not perfect for my Casio F-105 watch. Had to trim with razor blade to fit. 18mm width was correct, but band was too snug against the watch body to fit in the pins. This band is beefier and wider around the wrist than original. My last replacement band was the Voguestrap TX1826 and it was more like the original Casio band and more suitable for this watch. Do note that this band is not claimed to fit the F-105."
5,cost effective and it fits,I've had my Casio G-Shock watch for several years. The band wore through after years of everyday use but the watch still worked fine. I checked several options for a replacement band. They ranged from $29.95 (almost 1/2 the price of the watch when I bought it years ago) to 6.95 + shipping for this band. It arrived quickly. Was a little tricky to attach it to the watch but no worse than any other band would have been. It fit my watch perfectly.
4,"Overall, it was good, a different sound than normal swing","The CD has some really great tracks on it, espicially number 5 and number 7. They change style a lot on the album, so it doesn't become boring. The only drawback is the lead singer's scratchy voice does eventually become somewhat annoying, but the horns and rythym section cover it up nicely and produce a nice album for their dubut on Atlantic Records."
2,Atomic Fireballs Are Repeat Happy,"I'm sure this band is great to see live. ""Man With the Hex"", the first cut, would surely bring any house down. The hyperactive energy of every song leaps right off of this CD. But after the first few songs, I found the formula this band uses to write its songs - call and response from singer to the band and A LOT OF REPETITION. And the band's aware of it. In fact, the lyrics read, for example ""Drink, drank, drunk"" (x3) or ""swing"" (x42). Dancers who just want to move a quick and energetic beat probably won't fret with the lyrics on this CD. But . . . I'm personally tired of seeing a band slap on a pair of spectator shoes and a zoot suit, add horns, write lyrics where every other word is ""swing"" and jump into the scene. Indigo Swing or Jet Set Six, this ain't."
3,Commericial Swing Ain't the Thing,"I got a promotional copy of this CD and I must say I was disappointed. This is what happens you try commerialize a musical trend. Weak lyrics, predictable horn arrangements, lack of tempo changes. This CD is a lot of fun but gets old quickly. There are better, and less commerical, swing bands out there. Indigo Swing, The Chazz Cats, Jet Set Six and Lavay Smith to name a few. Check out the Cigar Store Indians for a great roots/rockabilly dance sound."
4,Great music for driving,"I first heard ""Man with the Hex"" on a ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" episode. Despite my juvenile television preferences, I can definitely recommend this CD to grown-ups. The music is great for road trips, or just after a generally bad day at work."
2,This cd was thouroughly disappointing.,"Swing Time magazine stated that Atomic Fireballs were going to be the newest craze in swing...I don't understand this. The vocalist sounds like Louis Armstrong screaming lyrics out of tune. The band's horn work is simple, repetitive, and nothing different than most other neo-swing bands...in fact, the horn work is much worse (it is often tinny and thin sounding without good support from low brass.) My last gripe with this album is that all of the songs sound identical (all use the same call and response formula except for ""Flower in Sand."") In one word; disappointing."
1,Terrible quality!,"The first time I used the sheets the cookies turned out perfect. I've used insulated cookie sheets before and never had a problem. I baked more cookies later, following the same recipes and they were flat as pancakes, These cookies were to be gifts so I was terribly disappointed. I followed the recipes to the letter and yet they were flat. None of the rising ingredients were expired, I made sure of that. So it was the sheets. I'll never get this brand again."
2,Non stick coating looks like garbage within months!,Have been using this pan for three years and am now in the market for a stainless steel pain with no coating. Yes this pan will bake cookies that are nicely browned without being too browned. My main gripe is that within 6 months this pan started looking DISGUSTING! You can't scrub this pan w/o scrathing up the non stick surface. Also the non stick surface holds some stains such as sugar and butter. Sort of hard to describe but overtime the pan has black spots and stains. There's no way to scrub them out. Can't put oven cleaner and bake it off in the oven. I'm actually embarassed for anyone to seem me baking on this pan!
1,The coating is too delicate,"Despite being careful, mine started to develop scratches in the first two days. I'm very disappointed."
1,OUCH!,"Don't let any water get in these pans or you're setting yourself up for a nice steam burn. A little water got inside of one of mine, which I didn't notice. Used it the next day and when I went to pull it out of the oven, the seam on the bottom split open, steam poured out and burned two of my fingers. So don't let it soak in the sink and be careful with using the dishwasher. Also, the nonstick coating looks like crap pretty quickly, which I think someone else mentioned. Not worth the money."
2,NOT UP TO BAKERS SECRET STANDARDs,I only use Baker Secret Products and was VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product it seems flimsy and also dents very easy. Would not recommend this one
5,Great for baking,"I discovered insulated baking sheets a few years back and love them. No more burnt bottoms! This one is nice and large so you can fit a lot of cookies on, and cook them on the same shelf for even more even baking. The non-stick surface helps, although I use parchment paper most of the time to ease clean-up."
5,Great value and quality,"They are fairly non-stock, though I prefer to use parchment to ease cleanup. Great price for set of two. Look sturdy. They stack nice and flat too. Great size."
3,non-stick doesn't last,"When I first got this sheet is was great. It was so non-stick that it was hard to keep anything on it. We only washed it with warm water and soap, but the non-stick has faded fast. things now do burn on it and don't slide off anymore... now it's just like any other cookie sheet. Not bad, but not great. The price is excellent though."
5,Delivers the goods,"Jennifer Marks delivers the goods. The tracks on this album cover a broad range of sounds, from the sultry stylings of ""Window"" to the infectious grooves of ""Live"" to the thoughtful vulnerability of ""Raggedy Ann"" and ""Fragile."" Jennifer Marks mixes up a fresh sound with her unique, slighty-skewed worldview and leaves your lips smiling and your toes tapping. ""Any Other Way"" and ""High School Reunion"" are tasty songs that you'll probably find yourself singing as you step out of the shower (if you're inclined to do that sort of thing). I highly recommend this CD."
4,Heavy duty bike rack,"I ordered two of these racks -- one for my road bike and one for my heavy mountain bike. The racks fit both types of bikes nicely. However, I would recommend using anchor screws to put in place. I didn't use on mountain bike and came home to a mess where the weight of the bike pulled the rack from the wall. The screws don't line up with my wall system so we had to make our own holes in the rack supports. It required us to buy a new drill bit that would go through metal. Other than that fact, I would highly recommend."
5,Excellent in all Respects,Te Kanawa and Carreras blend gorgeously in this fine recording. Chailly finds the elegance in the score like no other. Buy it.
1,"Strongly disagree and grossly misleading - ""0"" star","It is clear one needs to read ""The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin"" to see Mr. Gacis's dissertation is riddled with holes and I question this author's intention to sensationalize the practice of Buddhism, mainly to practice any Buddhism is to gain self-liberation, to gain individuality and ultimate individual happiness verses being a pawn in part of the mass ruled over by the State (in this case the author refers to Shinto); Nichiren Daishonin refutes being ruled over by the State, in fact Nichiren Daishonin writes:""Even if it seems that, because I was born in the ruler's domain, I follow him in my actions, I will never follow him in my heart.""[The Selection of the Time (WND066), Page 579, col 2, line 1, sentence 1 in paragraph 4]"
1,Kent misses the boat,"There's a lot of good content in here, but there's a big problem, as I see it. Specifically, the chapter on the line ""Where there is doubt, let me sow faith"" is just completely off base. There is no way Francis would have espoused the universalist nonsense that Mr. Nerburn puts in here. He would never have thought that all religions, whether buddhist, muslim or whatever, lead to the same God. There's no way you can read Francis' writings and come away with that without some seriously revisionist thinking.In general, the author strays way too far from the Christian Gospel that Francis espoused and epitomized. What Francis was about was pointing to Christ, not just some new age rhetoric about how to live our lives, or some fuzzy feeling about the unknowable God. He pointed to Jesus who is the living hope, and the worship of whom is the chief end and aim of man. So if this is your first encounter with St. Francis, skip this book and read Englebert's or Green's biography instead."
5,simple TRUTH,"So simple; directions to finding TRUE Life! It's all there,we just need to SEE it. How our world can change, if more of us begin to SEE this- it's been with each of us all the time."
1,GOT bored with it,"This book was boring ,I read 50 pages(In pain)mind you,before I said thats enough,the language was adult,but the story was not going anywhere,what a waste"
1,Stupid book,This is the stupidest book I have ever read. I couldn't even finish it. Don't waste your money. Too bad my mom bought it.
4,Invasion,"Eric Harry doesn't waste a lot of time introducing characters. He goes right to the action. And he doesn't stop until the last page. He also scares you a little with his realism. I especially like this book because during the invasion of the U.S. by China, he described a lot of places where I've visited. A great book, as were Protect and Defend, and Society of the Mind. We are anxiously awaiting your next book Eric."
1,Just say NO!,"I am ashamed I bought, read and finished this book. It was so unbelievable. Like all books lately the women act like men and the men begin to act like women. Stephie Roberts the presidents daughter serving on the front lines (right) transforms into Rambo. The president sees a hot chick at a war briefing begins to sleep with her even while being investigated as a enemy spy. The president acting like a love starved wimp. It just made me sick. I can go on and on but the bottom line is do not buy this book. Even if you get the book for free don't read it."
2,what happens to the ending?,"This book is really disappointing. The ending is so abrupt it begs for a second half. The character development is too lengthy, with not enough focus on the battle scenes. In his previous books, which I enjoyed immensely, Eric L. Harry devoted equal attention to the ""grunts"" in battle, the ones we really cared about. In this book, I couldn't care less about the Chinese, their politics, or the president and his scandals. The ending, once again (it bugs me! :-)) is so forced. The repriation to the rebellous factions is so swift and has a brushed over feel to it. And what should be a whole half of the book, was half a page long. Unless Eric L. Harry comes out with a follow on book that blows my mind, I will start questioning his writing skills."
1,Not a review - a plea for a sequel!,"I've already written a review of Invasion years ago, and I'm just typing a plea for Mr Harry to finish the story - Invasion had such an abrupt ending you had to wonder why it was left that way. This is such a fantastic story and it deserves a conclusion! Speaking as a retired Marine, I wanted to read about the 3rd MarDiv landing on Mainland China for some payback (OK, that may be a bit of a stretch ;-)Please, Mr Harry - finish the story!"
1,What was the point of this book?,"How can anyone give this book anything but two thumbs down. I was so disappointed in this book. After reading both Arclight and Protect and Defend, I had high hopes for this book. No such luck. Please don't waste the money on this travesty. Spend a little extra time doing research on military hardware also Harry. Never knew the M-249 SAW fired 40mm grenades. What a joke."
1,Not up to Harry's standards,"This was the second Harry book I read. Since I read it, I've gone back to reread his other works, and I can confidently say that Invasion is his weakest book.The characters are poorly realized and difficult to believe; the battle action is incredibly repetitive, and the whole premise is suspect. I was really disappointed."
1,"Extremely tacky book, but with little writing style...","I do not know Eric L. Harry, but he must have very little respect for the value of human life. Every other paragraph described a persons body being blown apart by shrapnel. What is even more dissgusting, is that he goes into detail about it. He also tends to favor women into that category, which is even sicker.What I cannot believe, is that Russia is totally out of the picture. Russia has second largest army in the world, and the largest nuclear arsenal. Don't tell me they just died off with the rest of Europe.I would recommend anyone reading this book, to stop reading it. I also suggest that Mr. Harry receives professional help; He is obviously insane."
2,english language the big loser,"Not a bad read, provided you can suspend your disbelief for long enough to ignore the implausibility of the story. What was amazing was the tortured grammar and generally poor english throughout and the numerous typos and spelling mistakes. Don't publishers employ editors to read the book before they put it into print? The author should sack his publishers."
3,Invasion,"I just finished reading Invasion. The battlescenes and the human drama associated with war are good, this being the trademark of Mr. Harry. However, the geopolitical scenario is too-farfetched as if the US and the Russians would not lift a finger to stop an ambitious China before its too late. There is hardly a mention of the Russians here.Likewise, being a fan of technothrillers/military novels, it is implausible for the Chinese to easily master naval aviation (supercarriers etc). But then, thats why they call books like these as fiction.Mr. Harry, I have all your three books. They're good to pass the time and raises questions of what if... Keep up the good work and hope to see you new work soon."
4,Tough story- good read,"Excellent projection of real ""bad news"" geo political situation. Perhaps a bit unrealistic in terms of technology and ""human"" capital. However, well written, fast paced...excellent beach book"
3,Fascinating concept!,"Imagine that China has just invaded American soil. Imagine that the draft is in effect and also that females are no longer exempt from the draft. Imagine that you are in the infantry in Alabama and the Chinese are knocking on the door. If you can imagine all that, then you are set in this novel. It literally takes you to the sweat of the battle, tells you what's going on in the battle and then rubs your face in it. This was a great read. I truly did not expect to enjoy this novel, but I did. What I really liked about this book is that for most of the action, it is told by a woman's point of view. What she goes thru in the invasion and how she fights and learns to survive. It truly is amazing to see the transformation she goes thru.**Pandora"
5,Great reference for understanding cultural differences,"The largest group of immigrants to the United States are Mexicans. In this book, the author, by mean of interviews, shows the several differences between the culture of America and Mexico.Questions like: Why do Mexicans come here? Where do they work? What do they miss? are answered.The experience of crossing the border, the ideas of the women and family that stay in Mexico, the reality that they find here, are also covered, and also the changes that they experiment living here, and the ideas of the children of the immigrants (chicanos).I think that everybody who needs to understand the mexican immigration from its roots should read this book."
3,I don't think this model has a handle,"I think that product number 13101 has a handle but 13191 doesn't, based on Shoreline's website (see www.shorelinecases.com) Hopefully, Amazon will investigate and replace the incorrect picture."
2,handle lacking,"this model does not have a handle! amazon must have mixed up the images. it is indeed very frustrating, for who needs a laptop case without a handle?"
1,"Disjointed, disappointing, rambling","Well, I believed the hyperbole by the publisher, and got the book at a book store. What a waste of a reasonably inventive plot."
1,If only there were a ZERO STARS rating,"This is the dumbest book ever. I really can find no redeeming value in it, other than the obvious humorous title and catch phrases. I am seriously at a loss as to how this woman became so popular. Maybe it is because our generation of moms (and I include myself) really don't know what we're doing and are searching, searching for someone to help guide us, and this woman just happens to be one of the funnier and do-what-feels-right advice givers. At one point in the book, she actually suggests reasoning with your toddler while they are throwing a tantrum. Please tell me that was another attempt at humor that went horribly, horribly wrong.... I say, don't waste your time on this worthless rag. You will get a few chuckles for sure, but there is nothing useful in here at all (unless you run out of toilet paper)."
2,angry feminist author in the guise of humor,"This book provides a few funny moments, but is not so much a humorous take on parenting as an essay on feminist, ultra-liberal viewpoints.Three cheers to the author for acknowledging that there are many different kinds of families. And that motherhood can be so much different than acknowledged by mainstream parenting books and magazines.However, Ms. Gore allows her own politics to color the book much too frequently for my taste. I found her statement that only liberals can practice attachment parenting, and that political conservatives are insensitive parents that just let their babies cry, ridiculous if not insulting. It is great that she is a successful single mother; however she has a subtle anti-male, anti-nuclear family slant to her writing.Many may enjoy this book; I personally prefer the ""Girlfriend"" series by Vicki Iovine--much funnier and minus the male-bashing."
2,"I guess I'm not as ""hip"" as I thought","I think Ariel Gore is a wonderful writer. She's funny & she writes about feminist issues without being too preachy. I guess my problem with this book is that it wasn't for me. I'm a liberal, young, hip mom -- but not hip enough I guess. This book is geared toward really young moms, unwed moms, poor moms, moms without traditional partners, moms without partners at all, moms without cars, moms without shelter, etc. Having a husband, a house, a car & some money in the bank made a lot of this book irrelavent. The author makes it seem that if you aren't fighting to just get by that you aren't hip. Well, fine, I'm not hip then, I guess.If you don't think you'll need to know how to get cheap legal advice to sue for custody, balance school & your kids from 4 different dads, or take the bus with your infant, you could probably just read another book. I suggest Naomi Wolfe's Misconceptions -- it's for the truly hip feminst mom, not the down & out one."
5,Fabulous!,"What a great book and what a hip mama! After you get this one, check out my new book, The Single Mother's Survival Guide. Another book for the hip mama's of the world! God Bless ya...Patrice Karst the author of God Made Easy and The Single Mother's Survival Guide."
2,This is more of a feminist book then a survival guide,"I wanted information on pregnancy and how to deal with it. All the info this book gave was what was going to happen in each trimester and very vagulely I might add. It is mostly a feminist book. Her advice is shadowed by this. Also in the book she slams the movie Beauty and the Beast. It was not about an awful beast that will always be a beast, It is about peoples impresssions of how someone looks and judging them by that. She needs to watch the movie again and put her man hating aside"
2,Not for me,"I'm sure this book's very useful for mamas living in dire financial conditions, but as for me, most of the advice the book has to offer was irrelevant. I hope I'll never get to a situation when returning an old used sweater to the store will seem like the only way to get some cash. (Not to mention the fact that where I live, you will never ever get money back for a returned item from a store. :) )As for the style of writing, I found the book mildly entertaining at first, refreshing even - but then it just went on and on and I soon found myself bored."
5,What a great book... finally!,"After years of books telling us that the only way to have a baby is with a million dollars and a husband, Ariel Gore's book shows women that it's possible to be both hip and a mom.Gore gives practical advice to women both approaching motherhood and those already knee deep. Her conversational style of writing makes the book easy and enjoyable reading... something that can't be said for most motherhood manuals.With chapters covering health, childbirth, coparenting and the like Gore gives practical advice for hip women everywhere, taking the fear out of childbearing.With so much pressure today telling us that we can't be young moms and hip femminists at the same time, I found Gore's book empowering for our generation, and those to come."
3,"Works, but not what I expected.","I received the product, installed it and it does work but it is not what I expected. When the product arrived it was in the original packaging but the clear overwrap was so brittle I knew it was ""aged"". The graphics on the box were faded so it had also spent some time in a store window. When I saw the note on the product that stated ""This product is Year 2000 compliant"" well..... I installed it anyway because I was desperate. If it lasts for a few years I will be happy, if it dies qucikly I will be upset. It would have been nice to know I was buying a piece of technilogy that was infact 12+ years old but represented as ""new""."
4,Path of Destruction,"The Acacia Strain are a new metal band I had decided to investigate after reading some good reviews, and after repeated spins I can certainly recommend them to any fan of death metal or grind.One of the first things you notice about The Acacia Strain is the sheer ferocity of their attack; they pummel you severely right off the bat with the neo-Meshuggah-like polyrhythms of ""Sarin: The End"" and don't let up throughout the entire disc. Tight, sometimes quite progressive riffs adorned with harmonic squeals and never lacking in heaviness; this is a great new band whose guitarists come across like a hybrid of Pantera (in the super-agressive playing style and buzzsaw-like tone) and Meshuggah (in the complex time changes). Add the harsh, quasi-death metal vocal style and nihilistic lyrics, and the overall package is a great metal release. Recommended if you need a dose of the good old ultraviolence."
5,A Soul beyond Compare,"Yes, I liked this book. I finished reading it in under 24 hours. That is a compliment all by itself! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes a good believable ghost story; however the first three chapters are slow but interesting. Then, the story really grips you and demands you continue reading it to find out what happens next. You can't put it down. I found the characters to be everyday people that you can empathize with and I would read more books by this author if and when they become available."
5,Hindemith just beautifully played,"Beautifully played and recorded, this one. Lots of dynamics in Mathis der Maler, subtly performed. Trauermusik is my favourite piece though, with a mourning viola, tugging at the heart strings, playing its melodies just perfectly.A must-have for Hindemith lovers."
3,Statement barely overshadows substance,"Interesting precursor to the thrash-jazz movement comes packed with explosive avant-garde interplay but also suffers from the strained dynamics. While the Metheny-Coleman alliance is an interesting one, it does not always work in favor of the music. Only when the duo go all out, abandoning tradition in search of brass-bliss cacophonies that the experimentation does not feel like a double-edged sword. Besides for rampant dissonance, there are a few tracks, especially on the new version, which demonstrate actual attempts at symbiosis. There is a lot to find in between cracks on this one, the end result is just uneven and even unsure."
2,Not for Metheny fans ... more of a pure space jazz effort,"I own all the Metheny releases, even Zero Tolerance. I like his jazz stuff when I can enjoy his guitar expertise and unique melodic phrasing. This CD doesn't offer much of that.Make sure you're into hardcore space jazz before you order it up. If you are, you might love it. If not, you'll be disappointed."
2,Too much ugly and not enough ugly/beauty!,"Although I enjoy most of Metheny's work and much of Ornette's, this album just doesn't work for me! Buy it if you find yourself able to enjoy repeated listens to cacophany, but if melody or harmony or even harmelodics are your thing, look elswhere!"
1,What was Pat thinking?,"Pat Metheny's style and quality of music is most often a symphony of sounds that can invigorate even the most dull of souls. This effort is not up to par. I should not blame Pat, though. This is NOT the Pat Metheny Group. This group was thrown together to make some really wacked out ""jazz"" that causes me to say ""I'd like my money back""."
5,Awesome Shoes,"For whatever reason I have always had trouble finding shoes that really made my feet comfortable. A few years back, after doing some research, I discovered the New Balance M1122MC (The single M is for ""Men"", the MC is for ""Motion Control""). I have been wearing this shoe, and its previous incarnations, for several years now and without a doubt this is the best shoe I have ever worn. It's is built around what New Balance calls an SL-2 last (or ""mold"") and and the extra room that this gives my foot in the toe box makes all the difference in the world. With out a doubt this is my Number 1 choice in shoes!"
3,Big Running Shoe,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
5,"From disco to house, all 12"" versions!!!","One of the best volumes in the series, this one is loaded with familiar tracks. My only real complaint is the 3 minute version of Rock the Boat, a song available in this length on numerous compilations. It seems out of place on a collection of 12"" singles. Other volumes are called ""Groovin You"" and ""more more more."" Track times are:1. I'm so excited (5:39)2. strike it up (5:03)3. love come down (6:14)4. rock the boat (3:20)5. say it isn't so (6:44)6. cherchez la femme (5:46)7. native new Yorker (5:31)8. I'll be your pleasure (7:48)9. you fooled me (5:35)10. I'm in love (5:53)11. leave a light on (13:29)12. I can understand it (6:23)"
1,all together disappointing,"Although I've read other books by Joe Casad which I liked, I'm disappointed with this book. I don't think its a book for someone who is a beginner or even someone who has a basic knowledge of active directory. I think this is geared for someone who has experience with NT and wants to upgrade to Win 2000 active directory. There's nothing wrong with that. But I think perhaps the author should have been more clear on that so that people like me don't have to waste time and money to find that out. I also think that there seems to be no order to the book. It jumps around from subject to subject. Maybe others would disagree, but I like to have a book that starts with basics and then works itself up. This book altogether has been a frustrating experience."
2,"Schiff does a solid, but boring job","Schiff's French Suites are much better. It sounds as if Schiff was not totally up for it when he recorded this one. The result is bland, uninspiring and careful, although excuisit, playing. Where is the dance and drama?Listen to Glenn Goulds excellent 5-star English Suites before deciding to buy Schiff's."
3,Schiff's Weakest Bach,"I agree with the other reviewers here that this recording is a mystery. Schiff's Well-Tempered Clavier is amazing, likewise his French Suites. These are bland. All the more amazing since I find English Suites 2 and 3 among the greatest keyboard works in the world.I strongly disagree with some of the stuffy dimwits who claim that Pogorelich's recording on DG (now out of print, but available in Europe) are 'inhuman' or disregard the true 'SPIRIT'. Get a life! They are the best renditions available and Pogorelich's best disc."
3,Schiff is not my cup of tea; a bit too boring,"Andras Schiff gets great reviews from the critics. His versions are generally praised by such authorities as the Penguin Guide. But to my taste he is a bit too middle of the road and bland. Of course, tastes vary. But I prefer Gould's English Suites."
5,Quality recording.,"I realise that many people do not appreciate Schiff's interpretation of this piece. I have listened to many other pianists' version of the English Suites, including Gould's, Peraiha's (spelling?), etc. but I still think that Schiff's interpretation of this work is excellent enough to be worth buying. Maybe not Schiff's best, but that's still better than a lot of others'!"
2,Outdated Info!,"For a book written in 1983 I believe the information is a little outdated for todays woodworker. No mention of Euro cabinets, which is the majority of what is built now days. The book has some good information but all in all needs to be updated."
2,poor illustrations,"This book offers a single technique to cabinet construction with little background or reference. The illustrations throughout are like the one on the cover, isometric line drawings. It would be nice if they had some call-outs and some photos of actual construction. For a do-it-yourselfer who wants to learn, this was disappointing."
2,This didn't tell me much I didn't already know.,I'm not sure what I expected but was hoping to glean some new information about building cabinets... Not so much.
3,Police Officer Puppet,"This is a good puppet...durable but smaller than I expected. My children enjoyed watching me entertain them with it, but they don't play with these puppets by themselves. I bought this one for my one and a half year old along with one for my seven and ten year olds and none of them play with them."
2,Not the greatest,"Being a police officer, I purchased this for my office to liven it up. The puppet is not too bad....the one patch was faded, and the right eye stitch wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to send it back for a replacement with Christmas around the corner...I'd never get it in time."
5,Alzhiemers Disease: Frequently aske question,This book helps me understand. The book also helped me explain Alzhiemers to families. I have recomended it to families.
5,The best book in the world.,"This book started my physical collection of furry publishings, and still remains the best singal pice I have. Not only is it perfectaly published, but contains excellent examples of anthropomorphic artwork. Its my personal bible."
4,High quality exhibition of anthropomorphic artwork.,"I think this is the best of the series, it's a shame that they had to be discontinued. The standard of art is very good, and I'm hard pressed to find a picture I like better than the front cover illustration by Michele Light :)"
4,Incredible.,A supremely well assembled collection of some of the best furry art in existence. I particularly liked the works of Michele Light.
3,Its a artist review book,Not a comic book not a story book its a collection of art by a couple artists
4,Good stuff,"For the most part, the artwork in the book is good, although I agree with other reviewers that it is blurry on some pages. It has a very broad selection of work, not all of which is furry. My only complaint is that it isn't in color. (Had I read all the reviews I would have known this) I expected it would be, and was kind of disappointed that it wasn't."
3,They work.,"These stuff sacks are heavier then better brands, and aren't of the best quality. That being said, they work just fine."
3,Very Small - too small to use for a sleeping bag,This is probably my fault for not paying closer attention but these bags were way smaller than what I thought. I was hoping to use them for sleeping bags but these are not even close to being big enough. Very bummed.
3,Aretha Franklins got such agifted voice but....,"I love her voice, but I could have done without all the talking in between songs. Still there are some gems on this recording"
2,Amazin grace The complete recordings,"The sound quality wasn't what I expected, also the CD wouldn't play in my player as most reproduced CD's wont that were burnt as opposed to factory issued CS's."
5,Gospel lover from California,"Absolutely wonderful...and for me, better than the original vinyl I bought when if first came out because there were original, live comments from those who participated in the production. A real flavor for the recording surroundings and what Aretha was experiencing at the time. I'm so very glad I ordered it and grateful this version is still available to own! In my opinion, this is the best album Aretha ever recorded & one of the most spiritual & uplifting gospel albums I've ever heard. I literally play it on my laptop every day."
5,Over the top!!!!,"My vocabulary cannot come close to describing the spirituality, the soul, the love, or the hope found in this work of art. I was four years old when the original recordings were done. Now, 27 years later, Aretha, the choir, the songs and the arrangements are unbelievably strong and moving. You are doing yourself and injustice if you do not get this!!!"
3,Prefer the Original 1972 Release,"I much prefer the original 1972 release of ""Amazing Grace"" than the complete original recordings. While the original release had some overdubbings and enhancements, it was a soul-stirring, well-produced compilation of the songs. Bring back the original release, please!"
5,incomparable!,"This is just one of the best gospel albums ever. Aretha Franklin's voice soars and transports, and the choir behind her is extraordinary too. It is impossible not to be moved when listening to this music."
3,Enjoyable Light Reading,"I enjoyed this book but was somewhat disappointed. I kept thinking I had read this same book under a different title and with only the names changed. I would still buy the book again and recommend it to someone who enjoys decent, light reading and love stories."
4,Excellent premise,"You'll not only love both of these wondrous tales, but you'll be impressed with the format."
1,utter disappointment,"if i could give this book 0 star i would. Horrible! The heroine in the first book is stuffy and overly conceited. There is nothing humble about her and as much as i tried to like her, ultimately found it impossible to do. I just could not find anything attractive in her personality, which by the way completely threw me off since the first impression of her was an absolute clash as to how her personality develops. First shes sweet and goal oriented, then she turns into a crazy snob harpy! As far as the male main character, i don't even know what to make of him since he did not stood out either."
4,Good product.,"Pulls your bullet out cleanly. Although a little bit scraped, the bullet is completely useable all to the exception of a competition bench shooter."
5,MUST LISTEN,"If you are a club fan, a rave fan, or just like to occasionally cut loose, you have GOT to check this one out! The mix is FLAWLESS and the selection 1st rate. Actually had the chance to see St. John spin live at a Northern California event New Year's. OFF THE HOOK! Check out his Fierce House 2 also. Same vibe....same style....same NRG!"
1,Highway robbery,"$8.99 for 1 pound of candy (cost at corner store $2.29) in a thin plastic box, I call that highway robbery!"
5,Pretty funny take the trials and tribulations of owning and showing horses,"If you know horses, or know someone that has horses, you'll definitely ""get"" the humor in this book. Even if you don't, the cartoons are still pretty amusing, and will give you good insight into the mind of the horse owner/rider/enthusiast.I highly recommend this book - very funny. And this is coming from a person who lived with an obsessed equestrian for many years."
5,Perfect Storm,Having been out of the Flute world for a long time it was great to return with this artist and playing music written by the nationality that has contributed so much to the literature and technique of the instrument. I look forward to hearing more from this artist.
4,No hole in my spoons,"I've had these spoons for quite some time now. While I do not use them for soup, I do use them for serving appetizers, such as ceviche, shrimp cocktail or carpaccio. I'm very happy with the cost, and performance and highly recommend these spoon for the uses I have outlined."
4,Nice spoons for the price,"I bought these spoons as a gift, and was pleased that they are as advertised and just what I expected. They should be a welcome addition to the table of my Chinese daughter-in-law. The reviewer who complained about the holes must not have paid much attention to the pictures.My only problem was that two of the handles broke in shipment. I glued them back together, thinking to just keep them for my own use and say nothing to the intended recipient. I emailed the vendor just as a courtesy to suggest that they beef up their packaging, so was pleasantly surprised when two replacement spoons arrived in the mail a few days later. They obviously take customer satisfaction seriously, and I wouldn't hesitate to order from this vendor again."
1,Beware,"Beware the return policy of this company!!! Do not buy unless you KNOW what it is and you know you will not have to return it. The spoons ordered are too short and fall into the chinese bowls, meaning you have to fish the spoon out from the bottom of the bowl. Also, there is a hole in the ends of the spoons, so they look like they are meant to be hung as decorations, not usable soup spoons."
2,Soup Spoons,"Spoons are much smaller than I expected... yes, ceramic and fit the description, but I was expecting more of a tablespoon size, not teaspoon size. The size of the spoon was not specified with the ad. Also was not especially pleased with the packaging.. the spoons were loosly bubblewrapped with enough tape to secure an elephant.. and the bag that it was sent (via US Postal Service) was previously opened and re-taped.. I'm not sure whether it was opened by the post office or it was sealed that way from the vendor. I will think twice next time I buy something from an FBA vendor... i.e. NOT sold by Amazon... I paid shipping, got it much later than expected (Amazon Prime spoiled me) and it was not packaged with the customer in mind. But I've got spoons now.. time to eat. Thanks.Ceramic Soup Spoons"
3,Ceramic Is Overrated,"I was looking for a good, functional Asian soup spoon that could be used with various homemade soups (Pho, Miso, etc.). These spoons are ok, but they're not great. A few quick-hit comments:- 4 spoons arrived damaged (merchant replaced them quickly).- Overall, they feel very delicate - a sentiment reinforced by the originally damaged bundle.- They're particularly shallow.- The weighting doesn't quite feel right. The bowl, understandably, holds the bulk of the weight. However, they feel awkward to hold.- The ceramic can be a bit slippery.Overall, I think I'll be looking for some less-fragile, less-shallow spoons to replace these in the near future."
3,Smaller than anticipated,I ordered the spoons excited to use them. They were about half the size I expected. My daughter thinks they are great toys to feed her dolls.
3,It lacks spark,"It does tend to drag a bit; ironically, even a requiem mass should have a bit of life to it. And the balance between the instruments and singers needs adjustment-a bit muddy for my tastes.However, the Pelleas part was quite satisfactory"
5,Take Your Time,"Having heard many performances of this piece, I have to differ with the reviewers here who say this performance ""drags."" Faure's Requiem is not a dramatic stage production like Verdi's, or a liturgical heavyweight like Mozart's. Faure's approach is entirely meditative and contemplative. You're supposed to float along with the gorgeous sounds. Dutoit sets up such a quiet continuity that the one major climax in the Requiem sounds overwhelming, even though it would be a quiet moment in the Verdi. Dutoit and Montreal recorded much of the Romantic and Contemporary French repertoire exceedingly well, and this is no exception. With a fine Pelleas et Melisande on the same disc, this is the one to own."
3,Drags quite a bit,"I have listened to many recordings of Faure's Requiem, and this, sad to say, is not one of the best. The music is, of course, breathtaking, but under Charles Dutoit's direction the tempo drags dismally. The lilting ethereal quality of Faure's delicate harmonies is lost under Dutoit's heavy-handed and overly romantic interpretation. Ironically, much of the dramatic impact of the more passionate moments, such as Libera me, is also lost in a sea of bathos. The only selection which I found did justice to Faure was In Paradisum, which, while more emotive than the usual choir of angels, did have a glorious, heart-expanding climax. For a more authentic, and ultimately more moving, recording listen to the Choeurs et Orchestre National de Lyons, under Emmanuel Krivine. I am sure that Faure would have preferred it."
1,Well performed garbage,"The dialog is a joke. The makeup makes everyone look like clowns. The production as far as costumes, audio and video is excellent but as far as operettas are concerned I would put this at the bottom of the pile. If you are familiar with the The Merry Widow and like it, then you will probably like this performance. This is no Die Fledermaus."
5,Gorgeous roomy car seat! Quality!!!,The car seat is very room and made very well. I had a Graco before and this is much much nicer. It comes w/pads for the straps too. This fabric is SO pretty and looks great w/my Joovy Caboose orange stroller.
2,2 defective units in a row,"I bought this unit about 6 months ago and the install went great and it worked solid for about 3-4 months. Then the rear right channel went out in the deck. I confirmed it wasn't the Amp or any intermediary wire so I submitted a RMA and Dual took care of it immediately and sent me a new one.It was the same unit so I kept all of the wiring in place and swapped it out. The new unit they sent me only works when Aux power is on but not when the car starts. This sounded initially like a wiring issue so I checked all of the wires and even completely replaced the wiring harness with a new one they sent me, but still the same issue. I'm not going to return this unit as I'm already in the red with shipping costs etc. Just going to start with a completely new brand.Disclaimer: When it was working, it was a decent stereo, and their customer support was nice, I just don't have time to keep going back and forth nor can I afford the shipping."
1,False Advertising,Item is advertised as USB IPod control. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH IPOD TOUCH or IPHONE. Do not buy this if that is what you want.
3,nice features but limited quality,"product sounded good for the price but only had generic EQ presets and didn't hold upto rough street cd skip, USB would only support IPOD shuffle.... then blackout, while turningup the volume, complete output failurealso, the box showed a remote to be with the unit, yet remote was nowhere to be found"
5,Dual CD Player,I ordered this item for my son's truck. He loves the unit. Thank you Amazon for offering items at a reasonable price with great quality. I received my order on time and my son was able to install the unit with ease.
2,broke,This radio has already stopped working after less than 4 months use . Going to try for a return but I no longer have the box.
1,Does NOT work with iPod Nano or Sansa View,"I bought this device mainly for the USB input port so I'm really disappointed that it doesn't work for two common MP3 players! Would not have bought it if I'd known, since there are significantly cheaper car stereos otherwise."
5,Dual XDM6350 AM/FM/CD Receiver radio,"A very good looking radio. Great value for money, works really well and has a soft bloe dial which makes using very easy.I could not buy a similar radio in Australia for the same cost. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a car radio. I have fitted mine into my caravan."
5,works better than expected for the $$$,"Remote control is nice + . I have this in my sauna. Plays anything mp3, cd, aux input, USB. Works great, sounds great.I am impressed with this unit for the money it can't be beat !Loudness feature is great makes the unit sound awesome at low volume levels. Would definitely buy again.The moron who said it won't play dvd's needs to read before he posts, most CD players DON'T play dvd's. The unit plays CD's perfectly."
2,Works for the most part,"The features work, but the higher end Dual is a better deal. This model is very limited to what you can see on the display. Also, it works for crap in the winter months. When it gets really cold, you have to push the reset button for it to turn on. Keep it warm and it works okay. I use the AUX jack a lot. Definitely worth the money if you have a broken factory radio, but the higher end model is better."
3,O.K. But Not Great,"The only problem I have had with this radio is the spotty radio reception I get with it. I always think of these things as a radio first and everything else as add-ons. With a radio that only works sometimes it can't get real high marks from me even tho every thing else works just fine. I like that I can fill up a gig. memory stick with music and listen for hours on end while I'm driving, however once in a while you've got to switch over to the radio for traffic reports and when all you get is static when earlier you got a good signal it's a bit frustrating. Maybe it's just mine, but why risk it. Keep looking."
2,WRONG INFORMATION,The description in amazon's web page says it is a AM/FM/DVD reveiver.....But it doesn't play DVDs...I complained but Amazon told me to write to the dealer...and guess: silence....no reply at all. People at amazon should check since..it is the same model I ordered but the information was wrong on amazon's page
4,Serenity Exposed,"This is a nice, precise book that de-mystifies relaxation techniques and meditation. Mr. Miller has done a wonderful service by offering up numerous simple exercises to reduce your level of stress and anxiety. He has also accomplished the neat trick of presenting these techniques divorced of any specific religious tradition--which means, of course, that the exercises don't require you to convert or follow any specific faith in order to benefit. As a matter of fact, he makes a strong case for experimention and individual creativity within the exercises so that you can create a ritual that works for you--because it works for you--and not because someone else says this or that should work for you."
4,Unbiased? No -- Biased? Nope.,"The problem with ethnic issues is that often the only people that care about them are people of that ethnicity -- therefore, this author is going to be called biased and unbiased by the 2 sides. I found this book an interesting account of how the issue of Karabagh was used by the National Democratic Movement (a loaded term -- basically, the people who were pro-democracy in the end of the USSR who also happened to all be of the ethnicity) in promoting their own goals. I read this book twice in an academic setting and found it to be one of the best on the subject."
1,Very misleading and dangerous.,"This book seems to be a regular product of propaganda. It is biased, misrepresents the facts and does not meet any standards of honesty."
4,shipped quick,"I bought this as a bed bug killer, a safe non-toxic way to keep bed bugs at bay. I have no idea if it works as of et, although an exterminator that I mentioned it to said it does work. So, if in several months, years, I don't have a reccurrance of bed bugs with a tenant, then I guess it works. The product shipped quickly and with good packaging and arrived intact."
5,Critter Control,"We took over a 20 unit apartment complex in Cincinnati, OH. All 20 units were infested with bed bugs and roaches. We drilled holes in the walls, floors and ceilings, and puffed DE into the holes. We used squeeze bottles cause you don't need much. Drill high so it drifts down the inside of the walls. We pulled most of the carpet out, as it was easier to treat. For easy application on floors and baseboards, spread a light layer with a dry dust mop. Use a dry paint brush to treat cracks and crevasses of furniture, pictures and wall hangings. Don't forget to dust around and inside electrical outlet. We are now bedbug free. We do occasionally see a stray roach, so a second application is in order. Very safe for pets."
4,Good Product,"Shipped fast, packaged well, worked great on removing flea issues after a few applications. 6 more words required to finish review."
5,Qucik delivery.,"I have used this product before.The powder does not work immediately but it does work. It kill fleas, bedbugs, ants etc.... And if you feed it to your pets that have parasites, it will help them also."
5,Many Uses,"I purchased this product for a family member who has morgellons disease. She uses it all around the house, in the laundry, etc and she ingests the DE to help get rid of parasites. I have given other family members product to try and all rave about how much better they feel physically in the knees, hips, the increased energy levels and more after mixing the product with a liquid to drink. I will purchase this again."
5,Perfect for my business,"The only thing I have found that works for me and my chicken farming is diatomaceous earth when it comes to mite and parasite control. I mix a little in their food, put it in their bedding and cages and also on the chickens themselves. They always look great and it helps keep them healthy and happy, plus its all natural! I love that."
1,Diatomaceous Earth,Great waste of money. Got sucked in by internet reviews for killing fleas. Hard to spread and even more difficult to get back out of carpets.
3,?????,"I don't know how this is supposed to work, but is messy and cannot use as a liquid in sprayer. Didn't help with insects either, apphids turned into an infestation. I must be doing something wrong."
4,"It fits, it works.",It fits and works as it should. It fits and works as it should. It fits and works as it should.
4,12 Dilemmas,"The original Higgins theological excursion into the subtleties and moral morass of the modern christian in the post-existential era. This is the seminal study that sets the theological baseline for all further refinement. A masterpiece of equivocation. I only wish the author had named each dilemma after a specific apostle to further reinforce the theological origins of western morality. The work make's Russell's essay ""Why I am not a Christian"" obsolete. Bravo! p. tillich"
1,This is NOT music,"This is the worst garbage I have ever listened to. Yeah, you can call it Heavy Metal if you're refering to the sound of trash cans rumbling down the block. This is not music and should not even be classified as such. Who are these people? American Idol rejects?Do not purchase..unless you like throwing away your money."
4,7 track single,"1 unreleased mix 2 original 12"" mix 3 funk mix 4 dub mix 5 radio edit 6 barry harris disco faq mix 7 take that to the bank"
1,Low sound quality,"Not CD quality, cassette quality sound. I would be a little nervous to repurchase from this vendor again because of the lack of quality sound. I could have recorded it off the radio on to a tape player and it would sound better."
4,Great Track Selection,"This release is definetely FuNkY. If you're just starting to get into the underground scene, then this is a great CD to start off with. There aren't too many hard breats and the tracks are seriously ""movin music"". Be sure to check out the song that caused dance fever in North America ""NEEDLE DAMAGE-THAT ZIPPER TRACK"". That song sits at the top of my list as one of the great productions of the YEAR!"
3,Not Quite the Same...,"Don't get me wrong, I really like D.J. Dan. I think that he is a wicked dj and can get the crowd on the floor. I've seen him twice and his sets were fresh. This cd doesn't represent the hype that he can create live. It is mixed smoothly, but I'm not a big fan of the lack of creativity. He could have done more, especially with his own great track--""That Zipper Track"". I've heard some great stuff done with that track, but D.J. Dan just plays through the set a little too conservative for me. Synopsis--Great D.J., conservative album!"
5,House Fans Unite!:),"If you really love House music, buy this! You will not be disappointed! I bought it two weeks ago and it is my baby. The best tracks are ""The Reason We Took It Underground"", ""House Of Funk"" and ""Phreakin'"". DJ Dan knows how to do it right!"
4,Only A Few People Have Funk,Dj Dan is one of the PHATEST djs around. This Cd is a must have to keep the good vibes rockin all night.
4,A lot of fun...,"...Just like Kreskin's stage act. If you read it in the same spirit, you'll enjoy it immensely. As for the other reviews on this page from Kreskin's ""mentalist"" competitors who did not enjoy this book, I say ""lighten up."" Your jealousy is showing. Kerskin's the big name writing the book and you're not, get over it."
4,Good,"I purchased this book prior to buying my 928. The one thing I wish that would have been covered is the suspension. Replacing the front a-arms on a 1986 is very expensive. Otherwise, it contains a lot of good information."
5,Ama takes writing and performing to a new level!,"Ama's talent shines in this latest collection...her songs are beautifully written and performed with maturity and style. Her knack for lyrics and soulful rhythms are inspiring. I look forward to seeing more from this rising star! I recommend this CD to anyone looking for a fresh, eclectic mix for their collection."
4,"If you missed this series upon release, you missed a lot...","This is pure 12"" heaven with clean, excellent mastering. Just wish there had been more than 3 volumes, and more popular track selections. Other two volumes are titled ""So Excited"" and ""groovin You."" Track times:1. everybody everybody (5:20)2. shame (6:31)3. pow wow (7:14)4. more more more (6:17)5. to each his own (5:18)6. standing right here (6:58)7. I can't go for that (6:05)8. if my brother's in trouble (7:21)9. love is always on your mind (10:09)10. inside out (6:23)11. hold tight (11:05)"
3,Disappointing third release.,"Grand Puba's third and long awaited album Understand This finds the Nowrule lyricist on a new label (Koch) and a very low budget. His lyrics are still on point and he still keeps it real, even though his beats don't match up to the rhymes. The album is produced almost entirely by Puba with guest appearances from his Brand Nubian partners Sadat X and Lord Jamar and MCs from Pubas label, Rising Son. If you are a devout Brand Nubian/Grand Puba fan this would be a good purchase, despite the heavily analog keyboarded tracks. But if you haven't heard of Puba, I would pick up 2000 and Reel to Reel before spending money on this release."
3,a couple of really good songs...,...and the rest is pretty bland lyrically. I will give this cd credit for having great production. I just wonder if the Grand man finally lost his steam.
3,Kinda disappointed,"Dont get me wrong absolutely LOVE Carol Burnette and Cast, but was very disappointed that for $25 that there was only 2 episodes on DVD."
2,"Dull, Dull, and more Dull",I am a fan of Sharon Kendrick and have read a lot of her books but this one was not one I found to be at all interesting. The story was slow moving and the characters were forgettable. It is not one of my keepers.
3,Pay your taxes,"Heading out of the solar system, the TARDIS passes Pluto further into the future and materialises - the Doctor blaming the new paint for jamming things. Outside, everything is wrong: there is a breathable atmosphere, a large city and much warmer than it should be. And there's a man about to commit suicide...'The Sunmakers' is Robert Holmes' rather scathing black comedy about taxation, here adapted by Terrance Dicks. Casting the Doctor, Leela and K9 in anarchic roles, and opposing them with bureaucratic opponents, this story is fairly fun romp."
1,"Warning, this product has Soy!","When I took this, I started getting stomach aches. I am allergic to soy, and there is no mention of soy on the list of ingredients here, however, it is listed on the bottle, which, I know, I should have read before I opened the bottle. Now, I am stuck with 176 tablets of a supplement that I cannot take. Please, Planetary Formulas, for the safety of your customers, list any potential allergens with your ingredients!"
2,Myelin Sheath Support,"I wish I could say that it has helped like one of the reviewers has written. However, after weeks of using the product, still no relief.However I will continue to use the product and hope I am wrong. I would like to report that it suddenly has done what is advertised. I know I have a blood vessel touching a nerve based on my MRI, and have typical trigeminal neuralgia. I am also using a prescription drug Tegretol, and trying acupuncture. So far the drug works, but I am not pleased with the side effects the drug causes."
2,"wanted the benefits, but...","I have MS and bought this product for the support of the myelin that is being damaged through the process of my disease. Unfortunately this product made me feel like I had the flu. I ached all over my body and felt feverish after only two days of taking it. I was fine the very next day when I quit taking it. If I had not developed these symptoms, it would have been a good product and I would have continued taking it."
2,A Sherlock Holmes case NOT solved by SHERLOCK HOLMES?,"Granada's habbit of replacing the Holmes or Watson actors if they weren't available with Mycroft Holmes is half repeated here. Jeremy Brett (Sherlock Holmes) was ill, and therefore, in the beggining, he explaines to Watson that he must go on a trip, and therefore, he barely makes any appearenences until the end of the film. Watson is is called upon to help ind a man by the name of Garrideb (taken from the original story THE 3 GARRIDEBS), if he exists. Meanwhile, the lazy Mycroft is asked to find the Mazarain stone, recently stolen from a museum. A connection is found bettween the 2 cases and soon, Mycroft and Watson are working together. Not an overal bad film, but Holmes's abscence takes away some of the ""quality"", shall we say?"
3,Pure fun with poor subplot,"As in the other Peabody mysteries this is less about the mystery than about madcap action and humorous hyperbole. Peters does it well. The book moves along quickly, characters appropriately absurd while still functional in terms of moving the plot along. Peabody's continuous commentary is vastly entertaining. The only complaint I had in this novel was the side plot of Peabody being concerned with Emerson's fidelity; it distracted from the typical energy and closeness of the two detectives.I'm sure within a few months I'll have completely forgotten the plot, but the memories of individual scenes (e.g. Emerson fighting off numerous ""high priests"" with Ramses clinging to his side) will be retained and cherished much longer."
1,KINDLE EDITION?,Why is this the only book in the series I'm not able to read electronically? This is a nasty trick. Amazon needs to explain...
2,Awfully disappointing...,"I bought several Peabody mysteries based on wildly enthusistic reviews on this site. To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The suspense level and depth of this book are on a par with Nancy Drew. Characters are so one dimensional, I was sick of them halfway through. The plot is predictable and the reader doesn't much care if the thing gets resovled or not. It is a well-constructed little formula mystery I would recommend for 10-12 year-old girls."
4,a little whiter for sure,"These strips are not the same as going to the dentist, but I definately noticed a little more brightness, maybe 2 shades after trying them for 10 days, which is good enough for me."
3,Extended period required for effects to be noticed.,"Check the expiration date on the box. Do not buy unless the date is at least several months away. The strips are small for someone that has a big mouth and/or large teeth. I have to use three strips at a time-two for the bottom row and one for the upper row. If you talk, the strips will become misaligned and slip which requires setting them on your teeth again. I am considering going to a dentist for whitening treatment instead of continuing to use this product."
3,Fountain not level,"While I loved the fountain, it arrived defective as slate parts were not level and I had to adjust to make it look reasonable and not like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I did not buy it on Amazon. Note: Manufactured in China. Also note that fountain does have a switch on the cord which I appreciated. Motor may not be top quality (small and hums) but I imagine it can be replaced if it wears out. Be careful to research size of any replacement motor as the cavity you place it in is small. I hope the manufacturer can correct the level issue as this is otherwise a solid and attractive product."
4,Nice fountain. Bit larger than expected.. wish it had a light,"Bought this fountain as a gift for my mom for Christmas as she likes the sound of table fountains and such. I have no real complaints other than the fact that the brass in the ""cup"" portion of the fountain was more dirty than brass tarnished. I'm sure over time the brass will get it's fair share of ""green"" brass tarnish however that's what gives it character. I set the pump on max water flow which seems to be more than enough to get a good flow. Unlike some of the reviews I experienced no problems, no leaks, no splashes, etc... Mom enjoyed adding this one to her collection. Only thing I wish it had was a light or something and a bit nicer rocks. Both easily remedied by a visit to the local craft store. I should note that this had a nice long power cord on it and a on/off switch inline with the cord which was nice to have if plugged in to an outlet that may not be easy to reach."
1,Crap quality,"I wouldn't even give it one star but it was described as a fountain, and it did arrive as just that - a fountain. So I offer one star.Other than that, it appears to be manufactured by 6 year olds. The base is crooked, so the whole fountain leans to one side - I'll have to shim it 3/8"" to make it right - this will make it splash all over the nice table its sitting on. The bottom water wrung was falling out upon arrival - I had to use silicone to 'glue' it back in place. This is ridiculous. Its so heavy, returning will expensive - on top of that, the packaging pretty much fell apart when I was removing the fountain from the box. Grr."
5,Surprisingly nice,"I was surprised at how much I ended up liking this fountain. The build is very heavy, solid, and strong. It appears some buyers get different fountains. One reviewer said theirs appeared to be some sort of laminate to simulate slate. Very strange. Mine appears to be some sort of rock. I doubt the colors are natural, it's probably painted, but it looks just like the picture.The metal pipe pieces where the water falls from are a bit crude in creation. This fountain, and the metal pieces, is clearly hand-made. I actually like it because it gives it a unique look and not a plastic store-bought look.The pump works, the right amount of rocks are provided, and the power cord DOES include an on/off switch. A reviewer said their's did not so, again, it appears some people receive different things.Highly recommended!"
4,Fountain,Serves its purpose. Decorative and works like it should. Set it up with an automatic watersupply otherwise runs out every 2 days
5,INCREDIBLE tabletop fountain,"Bough this for the wife last year to sit at the top of our stair case. It's a natural slate fountain (duh), and makes the perfect subtle trickling sound that my wife loves. It took less than 10 minutes to set up, and has performed flawlessly. The ONLY addition I've made to it is to add an LED ribbon bar behind the arch to give it a soft backlight. Makes for a perfect combo.Great addition to any house."
4,Positive experience,"The Kenroy water fountain works as advertised. It has a very pleasant sound, is restful and attractive. I took one star off because of minimal splashing. However, this IS a water fountain and protecting the surrounding area is easy."
2,Thoroughly Disappointed...,"Bought this for someone for Mother's Day. Received it in a timely fashion. Made of real slate, and beautiful, so that was excellent. However, I decided to take it out of the packaging and give it a test run before I gave it as a gift, and boy, am I glad I did. The fourth side of the reservoir was not mortared properly to the other sides, causing it to leak water when filled. It defeats the purpose of having a fountain. I would like to know who allowed this kind of poor craftsmanship off the line and into the hands of a consumer. I will be returning it."
1,Why pay $60 for an HDMI cable?,Unless you live next to a nuclear power plant your not gonna get any interference with ANY HDMI cable. Every cable is the same
5,The Song of a Neglected People,"Ray Elliott's Wild Hands Toward the Sky is a powerful, naturalistic portrait of a people and land we don't often read about: the American Midwest not long after the close of World War II. As the people go about their lives (farming, hauling cattle, keeping house) the war's impact is always there in the background as they consider their own experiences or those of their relatives who died or survived the European and Pacific theatres. This is a charming coming-of-age novel from the viewpoint of a boy who closely observes the people and surroundings of a pivotal time of his life. We share his experiences, comic and tragic, we sweat in the heat and shiver in cold prairie snowstorms with him. Overall a fine novel of a neglected people, period and landscape."
4,Racy humor and good food,"Fun book. As the author points out, first cookbook I took to bed.Receipes are somewhat basic, almost all with a healthy slant. Book is set up starting with appetizers and finishing with desserts. Many suggested menus using the books receipes."
5,can't go wrong,"The price is great. It works really good. My friends can hear me clearly and it even picks up sounds in the background, so don't think that because it's cheap that it doesn't work well. I've had it for a year already and not ONE issue :)When I bought it, I only paid 11 bucks though."
2,Worked good until it suddenly broke,"When I first received this headset, I was pleased that it was much more comfortable than the standard Microsoft headset. I have never heard of plantronics before I ordered this but I was happy with my purchase. It did its job just as a headset should do. But after about 13 months, my ear piece suddenly stopped working. People could still hear me talking but I couldn't hear absolutely anything. I was forced to throw this in the trash and order another headset."
1,defective,"Ordered this product, not once, but twice based on the reviews. Both times it was completely disfunctional-save your money and buy something else!!!!"
4,it's a better choice than the original,"First let me say that this item is more solid than the flimsey original headset that I have had to replace over and over but it isn't perfect. It's advertised as OVER THE EAR when in fact it IS NOT. The ear pads are slightly larger than the original but do not cup around the ear, they still rest on the outside. Another annoying thing is that the cord is angled at the controller end and constantly turns and gets in the way. my only other complaint is that the volume/on,off controller is much lower on the cord making it trickier to find in a hurry, On the original it hung abount chest level but on this one it in your lap, other than that it seems to work fine so far."
2,Not very good,"I expected better from Plantronics. The headset is comfortable and easy to use, but for some reason my voice seems to cut out a lot and I am always repeating things. Very inconvenient."
2,Cuts out,"When i got them, at first they were doing ok for the first 5 hours. Now i have to yell into the mic for ppl to hear me"
2,WORKED GREAT...until it broke,"this item was working great until people on the other side of the gaming world could not hear my son. he can hear them, but the mic on this item gave out. i already tried to fix it by jiggling the wire, but it just doesn't work anymore. it probably worked for about 2 months (weekends only because my son is not allowed to play on school nights)."
3,Cheap build and overpriced,"I bought these a while ago at about $7-8 and when they turned out to be junk I figured that you get what you pay for. The extendable head part separates easily and once its popped out it never goes back in firmly. The arm has poor resistance so it will start to fall after a while, and eventually it gets weak enough to break. When I came to order a new set of headphones I was appalled when I saw that they are charging $20 for this junk now. If you want to spent $20 get the Microsoft ones. Still giving three stars since I bought them for $7 and it was good enough, but if I had to pay $20 I'd give 2 stars."
3,Help?,Can anyone tell me if this comes in a packaging or is it just in the box they mail it to you in?
3,Good piece with loose plug,"The material construction is good with decent quality plastic material.I don't understand why MS used 2.5 mm plug, however, I don't really understand why this plug doesn't make click fit to the socket!The plug doesn't come out but I don't like the fact that it doesn't make click fit.Maybe I paid for what I bought."
4,headset for xbox,My daughter who this was bought for really liked how comfortable it was to have on while playing. She has had nothing negative to say about it. Good quality GREAT price!
5,Excellent Headset,"I purchased this headset to replace two other very horrible headsets. I had my fingers crossed for it to be good and so far it has not disappointed me. This is one of the best headsets I've used. The sound quality is great and everyone can hear me fine. It is also the most comfortable one I've tried too, as well as being the only one that can be used on the right or left side. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Works Great,Bought this because of the other customer reviews and it being cheaper than the official microsoft one. Turned out to be a great choice. Voice quality seems to be a lot better and it's just more comfortable than the original. Good Buy :)
2,Buyer Beware,"When I first bought this Xbox 360 wired headset, I noticed that it was much more durable, comfortable, and overall better than the default wireless headset that comes with the console. However, after the first month, the speaker on the headset cut out. My friends told me they could still hear me because I could speak through the microphone, but I had to listen through my TV speakers to hear their voices. A week later, I purchased another one of this product and sure enough, after less than one month, the headset speaker cut off, and I could still talk through it. If it hadn't broken the two times bought a different one of these headsets, I would have been happy with it. In short, buyer beware."
2,ear headset,"when using this headset you could hear static in the line, we had to return it for a different brand."
1,Only works for a couple of months,Microphone broke after only 2 months with normal game time playing (about 2 hours a day).
5,Great/Cheap Headset,"I had the original XBOX 360 wired headset that came with the system before I got this. That lasted for about 2 years before the jack that plugs into the controller snapped off. I've had this one now for a couple months - I got it because it was cheap and had good reviews. I'm extremely happy with it. It shipped fast, works well, and looks awesome. Mine is black and green. It's comfortable but I don't play for more than 4/5 hours at a time so if you are a marathon gamer, consider this. If this breaks, I'd definitely buy another one."
3,Fits weird,"The mic and earpiece work great. The only problem is that it fits funny. Maybe I have a big head, the hard plastic isn't very comfortable. With the actual communications equipment, Plantronics keeps its reputation with me- everything is loud and clear and unlike other brands of mics, you don't have to dig your nails into the on/off switch to toggle it. That's pretty handy.If you game more than a few hours a week, you're better off spending [...] bucks on a good piece."
4,Good reliable head set.,"I bought this to replace my aging wireless head set as I cant afford to buy another 60$ one. I also was not keen on buying the default microsoft one. This has lasted me a good 3 months with no wear. The audio comes in well, your voice is heard at a good level, and the adjustable mouthpiece is nice. Im not a big fan of the clip mute, as I'd rather it be on the controller orginal xbox style, but most headsets come like this now."
2,A Good Device With One Major Flaw,"I ordered this device for one reason: the price. From all the reviews on Amazon, as far as I could tell this was a perfect substitute for, if not an improvement on, the standard Xbox headset. However, upon firing up MW2 for the first time to play with my new Planktronics Over Ear Headset, I noticed that the mic symbol was always on. For any avid COD players, you know that the mic symbol means that you are currently talking, if there is no mic symbol then you're not making any noise. On this particular headset, it always thinks that I'm talking no matter if it's dead silent on my end. So my teammates basically hear static throughout the game unless I turn the mic off. This is a major flaw and for me it ruins the otherwise well designed device. I don't know how this headset performs with other games, but for COD it's useless."
1,Very bad mic,By seeing all the good reviews and also seeing that it was made by Plantronics I thought it would be a well done mic. Though I guess you get what you paid for. The sound was very bad. You can not hear the person your talking to. Also you have to shout into the mic for them to hear you. I had other mics that were the same price but a lower brand work better than this. Its sad because I really do trust Plantronics for everything. Sad they make a bad headset for the xbox
3,"Does what it needs to do, but not for me.","The headset does well on what it's designed to do, but doesn't consider those with wide faces, like me, when it comes to the microphone. Even though I was able to extend the mic out and bend it, it didn't seem to reach my mouth. That may not be needed, but when attempting to whisper or talk quietly, the mic did not pic it up."
4,"Much better than the basic Xbox Headset, and cheaper; great quality for price","Firstly, I bought the basic Xbox Headset (the $20 one) and it didn't pick up my voice very well, and after about 6 months, the mic no longer worked, so it can be used to listen to people, but not to talk to them. So I invested in a new headset.I came across this headset, and it was a perfect price, and after reading a few positive reviews about it being better than the Xbox one, picking up sound better, and being a bit stronger (structurally), I decided to try it out.So far, great quality in comparison to what I had before. Picks up sound much better, so I can talk using a regular speaking voice without moving the mic closer with my hand. It is a bit snug around my head, but it's just about perfect on the biggest setting. For the price, great quality, exactly what I want.Note: This headset does not include in-game sounds; just in case that's the kind of headset you're looking for."
4,You can't go wrong with this mic,"To be honest, when i was looking for a mic to use I wasn't looking to find a cheap product, I was looking for one of those high-end mics( you know, the expensive ones). But then, I found this mic, and a lot of people were giving great reviews for it. At first, I was skeptical, but then I thought to myself ""it's cheap"" so what the hell. I decided to order them. It came within a week! As soon I got them 'em in my hands i immediately plugged it into my 360 controller and started a game with some friends. As soon I heard my friends speak to me i realized the quality of the headphones. Not only can I hear them clearly, but there's no static, either. I was stunned with how good they worked. So, if you're looking for a good mic that's not to expensive, try these out! But! I will warn you though, if you plan a playing long sessions with these on they will start to irritate your ear,that's the reason why i left off one star. So, other than that these are a good buy."
4,Pretty good for the price,"This mic is pretty good for the price but after using it for a decent amount of time it started to make crackling noises where the sounds comes out, but it's only once in a while. so I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to the $20 xbox mic."
5,Excellent Item,This headset is comfortable and so much better than the Microsoft that digs into your head. I definitely recommend this product if you need a new headset.
1,Didn't work,It didn't work in-game. No sound coming or going. I was able to get very low sound sending voice message though. I think it's because I use HDMI and this only supports analog for gaming.
2,"Great, until it stopped working","Worked perfectly for about a month, and then it stopped working completely. Very disappointed with the quality of the product, waste of $20."
3,Regular headset is better,"My original headset broke, so I got a new, uncomfortable headset that works great. Then I got this one and my friends can hardly hear me talking."
3,Broken?,"After about 4 months of steady usage it broke as my brother stretched it over his head.He then superglued it and left it, I came home and got super glue in my hair.I guess after so much use anything breaks, Right?"
1,Headset does not work,"Bought this thinking it would be a great replacement for the OEM headset. Wrong, earpiece does not work and you can only hear what other people are saying through your TV."
2,Good until it broke after one month,The headset works great until about a month after opening the package. I was playing with my friend on GTA 4 and it just cut out and didn't work anymore. I got so pissed I tore it apart. I big waste of $20.
4,Works better than the MS product,"The standard Microsoft product that came with my Xbox had a lot of static interference like it wasn't getting a good connection. This one sounds much better, with no static. The only thing I liked better on the OEM headset was the location of the mute switch. This one has it dangling in the middle of the cord."
1,Works Intermittently,"When talking into the headset, it will only transmit the first couple of words spoken, then nothing, then an few more words, then nothing, over and over. So the listener only hears broken pieces of the speech, with every couple of words missing. It can hear OK."
1,terrible,I got this so i always dont need to wear my turtle beach. The headset looks nice but it never picks up my voice. I always have to talk so loud for it to hear me. Every other headset iv owned heard everything.
4,Better than Stock,"First off let me say that this headset is WAY more durable than the one Microsoft one. Second, the audio quality is also a little better and it looks cooler too. Only problem I had at first was getting comfortable with it but you get used to it after an hour or so. Overall great buy for great price. Buy this if you don't want that cheap Microsoft one anymore."
4,Works just fine,"I bought this to replace my standard Microsoft Xbox360 headset that has been slowly going bad. I surfed around and ended up buying this one. It works just fine, in fact it works better than my old headset when it was brand new. it feels good on the head and i can hear everybody just fine and all my friends say that i sound better. good price and works great"
4,Good Value,Works as advertised for someone who likes to do some on-line gaming. Comes in black. I have had no problems.
1,Did not work,"Purchased this headset as an attempt to upgrade standard plug-in xbox 360 factory item. The headset did not work (speaker worked, but microphone would not - headset jack would not fully seat into xbox controller).Headset was returned and another factory headset was purchased.Would not purchase again."
5,Great Headset,"Much better than the Default xbox one. Very comfy spend the few extra dollars and get this one. I like things to be loose fitting and hate tight things and this thing feels like air, I've got a big hat size too. Played today and everyone could hear me great. Looks sturdy too."
1,Not even a year old and it broke,"I loved this thing when i first got it. Far cheaper than the microsoft one, more comfortable, sound was better and Mic was further away from the mouth which is nice. But after year the speaker just decided to go PooP on me. I take great care of my electroincs and in this case it's clearly a defect. I've tried everything to fix it w/o breaking it in general, and nothing. Although i've considered buying another one, i'm checking to see if there is a 1 year manufactures warranty before i do. This is a great disappointment give its performance up until now."
2,Fatal Flaw,"This is inexpensive, we ll made, comfortable and you can hear clearly.So what's my beef? The fatal flaw is you have to take your hands off the controller to mute the mic. With the inexpensive xbox headset, the mute button is the flick of a thumb where it plugs in on your controller.If you never need to mute your headset, this is great...If you do, pass"
3,Whisperers beware.,"For the price, it really isn't a bad headset. The issue that I kept running in to was it seemed like I had to talk loudly, sometimes very loudly, in order for it to trigger the mic, and stay triggered. The voice sensitivity on my XBox was just fine, but the mic would constantly cut in and out unless I maintained a loud voice. I couldn't even use the mic at night if my girlfriend was sleeping because I certainly couldn't whisper for it to work. I wound up ditching this headset and went with the Turtle Beach X31.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap headset, this will work, but keep in mind that if there are instances where you're trying to keep your voice down, you'll render the headset useless. Pay a bit more and pick up a Turtle Beach mic, you won't regret it."
4,Almost a year and still works!,"This item is just awesome.Great value, great sound, doesn't squeeze your head and the mic part is a bit flexible.Definitely a better buy than the stock head set.For the price and the quality you can't beat this item.Would buy again if anything were to happen.."
4,not great but not the worst,The xbox 360 over ear headset is actually really good its not like turtle beaches overall but its way better than an xbox 360 microsoft headset if you would want to buy this headset I would suggest it if your not the biggest gamer but like to play for fun..if you take the game seriously this mic is not for you.
2,headset,it so sensitive it picks up your breathing and makes it sound like your eating your microphone
3,"Work, but low price for a reason.","Sound fine when working. Nice comfortable headset for $10 bucks, but mine broke within 60 days.I was not rough with them, an only used them an average of 6 hours a week.Wish mine still worked, but I will not purchase them again."
3,just ok.,"This headset ""worked"", but it was very hard for my friends to hear me talking on Xbox Live. I would have to talk louder than normal for them to hear me with this headset. The microsoft one is better, in my opinion."
4,Over headset,"This is a very good product, and the price is very resonible. My old head set that came with the xbox had alot of problems and was ready to llok for a new one . This product overall vaule is worth it still lasting after 6 months clear as day."
3,Very good for its price,"It works very good, other players hear you good enough and its confortable. BUT, the volume doesnt get high enough to hear some players, it is too limited and wouldnt be strange if u hav to push the headset to your ear sometimes to get to hear."
5,Awesome,This headset is great and cheap i bought this around march and still working perfectly i would recommend this to anyone who is planing to buy a cheap headset
5,Best headsets ever,"These headsets are the best ones I've ever owned in my life of playing Xbox 360. They are sturdy, adjust to your head size, and even the mic adjusts in length and closer or further from your mouth. There is no echo to the players in your party or game, and the sound from them is very loud and clear to hear.I'll never buy any other headset again!"
4,Buying Again,"I bought this product roughly 6 months ago. It just broke and it was probably my fault because I am often dropping my controller over my chair on accident, which unplugs it in a rough manner. I am buying this product again because it worked great and was very durable. Also, it was very comfortable, even when the end opposite the speaker got chewed off by my dog. Overall, it is a great product and very durable, I will be purchasing it again."
3,ok but still like the original better,"( This following product was used for xbox live only )Well its ok but a few things i noticed really bothered me after the fact. These are the four things that i find wrong with this product would be. 1.) the mute and volume control is in a awkward place, 2.) the pad that fits over the ear is kind of uncomfortable but nothing you cant get used to 3.) the plug fits loosely in the jack and 4.)its kind of hard to here other people over Xbox live....... over all still decent but not what i expected"
1,Worked for 10 minutes,It worked very well for 10 minutes. It was very clear and crisp. Ten minutes later and my friends could not hear me barely at all. I switched over to using the Kinect as a microphone. At least I didn't spend a ton of money.
4,Great affordable mic,"If you're looking for a mic that just works, this one does great. I have had it for over a month without any problems. Overall, good product."
3,Decent enough for the price,"My standard headset that came with my xbox conked out on me a few weeks ago. So I saw these online, saw that it had some decent reviews, then decided to get a pair. Well... they work. So that's good. They weren't expensive, that's good too. My only real issue is that I have to speak a little louder than normal for people to hear my OK, on the other end. In general, they're nothing fancy. They're cheap and they work. Do you need more than that? Hopefully they last a good while. That I'll have to wait and see..."
3,Didn't work,I was never able to get this headset to work. My husband ended up purchasing one from Turtle Beach that has worked great.
4,Good headset,"Good nice headset fro those of you who want one, but don't want to drop 50 bucks for one. It feels good and probably is better than the one Microsoft offers."
4,Great Value and Durability!,"I bought this to replace the headset that came with the Xbox 360, which unceremoniously broke shortly after I got the console!The headband is comfortable, and much sturdier than the flimsy plastic the default headset is made from. The ""earmuff"" piece is also much more comfortable. Microphone also feels less flimsy when handled. Overall the build quality of this headset is *far* better than the Microsoft one.The only annoying thing is that the volume and mute switches are on a remote clip, and not directly near the controller. I generally don't clip anything to my shirt while playing, so this made for some confused fumbling when trying to mute sounds.Nice bonus is that the product works with both Xbox and 360.Overall, a fine unit, a great replacement for the default 360 unit, but the controls could use some work!"
3,"Take something, give something back","I bought this set on a whim, needing to up my order for the free shipping. I was always happy with the official 360 version and I don't notice any difference in sound quality over the 360, but the construction feels somewhat sturdier, which would be a plus. On the other hand I miss having the volume and mute controls right under my fingers as in the original headset. That's just perfect! With this set I need to look down to find the switch, which is also tough to slide with one finger."
1,terrible,"I purchased this to play MW3. The first time I used it it worked great. I went to use it a second time a couple hours later and the mic wouldn't work. I tried everything I could to get it to work, but with no success. The old saying is true. You get what you pay for. This is a $12 POS. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
4,Serviceable,Not a bad option for 360 headset. Plug is not snug but sound is good both for you and others.
2,It does it's job.,"It's pretty uncomfortable and the microphone gives quite a bit of feedback to all my fellow comrades online. Oh well. Does it's job, just don't expect top of the line."
2,the design is knock off quality,"the actual audio of the headset isn't bad at all. it's the design where it really goes bad. the mute/volume being on the wire (instead of the plug like the microsoft headset) is so stupid it's ridiculous. also the adjustments on the head band and mic aren't very good. the mic only adjusts up and down, you can't bend it farther/closer from your mouth."
2,didnt last long,13yr old complained about this constantly. My recommendation would be to spend a little more money if you want it to last more than a year or so.
4,Decent headset,"The headsets alright. I havent broke it yet which is nice. Its kind of uncomfortable at first but you grow into it, but it seems to be holding together i would probably buy it again."
2,Nothing short garbage,They worked and I could game while chatting fine but hurts my ear and in the end just stopped working out of nowhere.
3,works well,works well just wish the volume and mute control was connected to the controller for quick and easy access while gaming.
4,Gaming Headset,"This is not a game but the headset to listen to the game and speak to friends over (as we use it) XBox Live. Seems to work fine. I think it was a little uncomfortable for my child's smaller head but he wears it without complaining. The picture shows it to be white (which he was excited about) but it was gray. Overall, a good buy for the money."
3,Good headset but short life...,I've had two of these headsets in a year and each only lasted about six months. First thing to go was the headset speaker on BOTH headsets. They never showed any signs that they were about to die they just went dead all of a sudden. I wont be buying any more.
2,Disappointing,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It had pretty good reviews. He said he likes the way it looks and fits, but it doesn't have a tight connection. I tried it on, the sound comes in and out, and sounds static-y. Not worth sending it back, but I definitely don't recommend it!"
2,Not good...,You have to practically put the mic in your mouth for it to pick up your voice. Not what I need.
4,More comfy than the microsoft original,"I bought this for my husband 6 months ago, and recently bought myself the same headset. Managed to get it for less than the microsoft headset and it's a more comfortable fit ... for me it is anyway. It's sturdy on the head and the mic doesn't get in the way when I want to take a drink. All in all, it's a great product for the price."
3,does the job but,The headset itself for chatting does well. But the cord is much too short and i keep pulling it out of the socket while move the remote and playing. Going to try find a better one.
1,Experienced a poor product,"I have returned two of these so far. Both times the reason has been the earpiece. I was able to be heard on the mic but the audio stopped working. In a period of a minute or so, it went from full volume to about 20% to being able to hear nothing. Again, I experienced this with two different shipments of the same headset. This was VERY gently used during the short time I had it. Adult use only, no children. I applaud Amazon's return policy as it is hassle free and I did not suffer any financial loss. I'll be back to researching a better product for gaming."
5,"Durable, comfortable, and worth it","I bought this after both of my Microsoft headsets broke and it arrived on time in the original packaging. I sadly lost my warranty, though, because me and my brother were wrestling and broke the band of this headset. We put full weight on it and barely broke it off... I just finished the job then duct taped it to a wool beanie so now my head is warm and I can talk with my friends. It still works perfectly and proves durability and I love this headset... when i get some money I'll replace it. Hell it outlived my wired controller which is kept workable by duct tape... ghetto, huh?"
2,"Better than Xbox's, but still broke","This headset is better than the one the comes from Microsoft but its still not great.It does what it is supposed to do. I can talk through it on xbox live and hear others.The main problem is that these headsets are not made to last. This one snapped after a few months. I tried to tape it up but it was uncomfortable.Get some turtle beach headsets. They are quality, last a long time, and are worth it for games like COD. I am glad I did because I kept wasting money on the cheap plastic ones."
4,So Far So Good!!,Seems to be sturdier than the microsoft version. Works well. The price is right. What else could you ask for?
2,Stopped working,This unit stopped worked about a month after we got it. Had purchased before from Best Buy without issues but this one did not last.
5,Very good,"Must say for the price its 100% worth it, good in & out sound, sometimes i can her my voice but maybe it is for the internet connection, but with that price i can't ask more 100% recommend it"
4,Gray and white?,"The mic seems to be of decent quality, not much different from the standard headset from microsoft. Though they're definitely not black and green as the video review shows. Which was the whole reason I got them. They're the same set shown in the picture. If I had to buy them all over again, I'd probably just get the standard microsoft set. They're slightly cheaper and actually match the 360 slim controllers."
3,could be louder.,"This headset works well, but I wish it was just a bit louder. Great microphone for the price, however. If you need a mic for xbox live, don't bother spending too much for the microsoft brand, those break far too quickly."
4,Good for the money,"I'm currently going through some of my old order to review how they've held up. I purchased this item in 2008 and it still works great! A confession first: I am not a hardcore gamer. If you are planning to use this every night and throw it when you lose, I can't guarantee this headset will last.I use mine about once a week. Sound quality is great, still. While I have several friends that break in and out with their official Xbox headsets, I've never had any issues. The separate volume control is great and the headset itself is comfortable. If you're a casual gamer, this headset is perfect."
3,It's ok for use with official xbox controllers....,This headset works wonders if your using an official xbox wired/wireless controller. Using a third-party controller (i.e. a controller from Game Stop) will result in the inability to chat on xbox live. Your mic will have a bunch of static/noise and your voice will be extremely low.
4,Great Buy,"This headset is by far a cut above the $20 Microsoft headsets.It adds new depth and clarity to voices and is very comfortable at the same time.The mic has to be placed just so to pick up your voice, that is due to the noise canceling technology that this headset includes. You can have another person near you and it won't pick up their voice even if they are speaking loudly.I feel this headset is WELL WORTH the price + shipping!"
2,headset.....no different than original ones,"i dont see the difference between these and the ones that came with the xbox to warrant the higher price. also, the mic switch is harder to get to than the original ones"
4,Not a game,"This is a headset - not a game. It makes the games a better experience. Sound quality is good, mic is good, and headphones are comfortable"
2,Audio cut-outs happen all the time in Xbox Live chat,"Like some of the other reviewers here, I'm having issues with this device not properly transmitting audio to the headset. The microphone works fine, so other people can hear what I'm saying, but I can't hear them during long periods of time. I've tried messing with my wireless settings on my router, but WoW seems to run fine with minimal latency so I have to believe its a problem with the headset as opposed to my network configuration. It's cheap, and you get what you pay for here."
1,not worth it,i bought this and within a moth i found out that the wires for the mike were ripped were you talk so it was a waste of $20.00. So don't by it from amazon warehouse by it from one of the other sellers or go to Wal-Mart
3,2 songs,There are 2 good songs on here. Reinvention and Beneath the Encasing of Ashes. Buy those two songs on itunes and abandon your ideas of owning the entire cd.
2,Not what I thought,"I really thought this was going to be a re-recording of Beneath the Encasing of Ashes. Its not at all.. all they did was put all of their early stuff on one cd. There are five songs at the beginning that are re-recordings.. but other than that, this is a waste of money. I had their ep's and Beneath the Encasing of Ashes already.. I didn't want another copy of them."
3,My grandma gave me this book and...,i red this book with my gramma its a prity good book the colors arent vary pritty and i like the monkys and all the animles the hippo looks funy in her dreem this is a good book for kids
3,"Nothing better out there, yet unreadible for students.","An absolutely essential reference. There is no more comprehensive and complete survey of the history of archaeology. The revisions in this edition all make sense, kudos to Bruce Trigger for bringing this excellent text forward 20+ years, and rethinking some of the more distant historical contexts as well.No other work can stand in for this book, and yet for the purposes of teaching the history of archaeological theory, the book doesn't work. It is lethal. Undergraduates will not read it; they can't, and maybe they shouldn't be expected to.I'm not interested in running in the other direction, administering Death by Theory or something equally light on content. That doesn't work either. But how can we justify assigning this text in light of the small fraction of it that will actually be absorbed, even by majors in the discipline?"
2,More boring than necessary,This book was informative but laid out in a confusing and boring fashion. Not worth a read unless you are absolutely required.
1,yuck,my parents play this record all the time and it puts me to sleep.I wish the songs were more original. they sound too much likeall the other surf music around. when they do another albumI hope that the songs dont all sound the same.
4,"Fun, even for adults","This is a fun toy even if it is just a flashlight. It has several sound effects that play when you turn the light on. I bought it for a 3-year-old's birthday, and my fiance enjoyed playing with it more than the 3-year-old."
3,Not to happy with this flashlight.,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because she loves spongebob. I was expecting it to have spongebob talking. It just has 3 sounds that are kinda boring. The light is really bright so I think the age limit should be set higher.
3,Ok flashlight,We bought this for a friend and it was pretty disappointing. The battery wore out pretty quickly. Some of the pieces come off easily
5,Words to Savor--,"Ever hear the expression ""They don't make um' like this anymore?"" Well they don't write um' like this anymore either.--50 Great American Short Stories-- is just thatDamn good writing!The short stories are written by Shaw, Poe, Steinbeck, Hemingway, O Henry, and Hawthorne, just to name a few of the classic geniuses. THe vocabulary is lush, musical, and flows into one's ears like a kind of sugar for the brain, the soul.The only problem with reading these stories is--if one is already a writer of sorts, they must come to the conclusion that arriving at the same level as these literary 'Gods' is not an option--only a tool for them to grasp, hold, and savor in their minds like a priceless gift.My suggestion is to unwrap these little jewels and drape yourself in their beauty--then wrap back up and pass along to somebody else!***Thank you to the teacher at St.Scholastica for allowing me to be an out-of-classroom-student*** I loved it!"
4,Home be Another Way,"Our church school class has used this book of sermons for our Advent, Christmas and Epiphany lessons. We have been very pleased and will pick up with the sermons for Lent and Easter. this is the third of Barbara Brown Taylor's books we have enjoyed."
5,When Brycen Died,"My infant son died two days after he was born. Where was God in all of this? I went to God for both comfort and hope, but I found myself also feeling angry at Him. I wanted to know Him better. The lectures in this book opened my eyes to a God that is full of love and compassion. I found this book to be helpful in my healing and helpful in reconnecting me with my God. Many times I refer to this book to find hope. In particular, there is one sermon titled ""Life Giving Fear"" that talked about suffering and pain, and where is God in all that. Through this sermon and the scriptures shared, I've come to realize there is no connection between sin and suffering. This book is wonderful. I continue to read it to help me in my relationship with God and my spiritual healing."
3,YEAH ME TOO,"OK, I was in the first dinner theatre production of ""A Chorus Line"" with Joe Inscoe who was in ""From the Earth to the Moon"" with Elizabeth Perkins who was in ""He said She said"" with Kevin Bacon."
2,Lots of totally worthless trivia,Only good to go along with the game--and the game is impossible to play.
1,A Substandard Work,"This is a badly written book. While the author provides some useful information on Jaspers's life, the writing is tedious, indeed almost incomprehensible in some places. Jaspers is a philosopher well worth reading, but his own style tended to be opaque. The author of this volume does little to help us understand him. Perhaps the author lacks confidence in her own command of English or German. At the end of the book she appends a number of Jaspers's letters in German with her own English translations, noting that she is unsure of the adequacy of her own translations."
2,Where's the Evidence?,"This is a ""legal mystery"" story centered on a criminal trial. The defendant is indicted and prosecuted on an alleged crime committed thirty years ago. The prosecution does not have a scintilla of evidence against the defendant. The Defense wins the day by offering ""surprise"" documentary evidence that would never be permissible in an actual trial. The drama rests on such a flimsy premise that it's ridiculous."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.I think D. W. Buffa is now at the top of the pile when it comes to legal thrillers. In 'Breach of Trust' he's written a novel that takes you through the corridors of D.C. while providing thought provoking political commentary. Some of his characters are somewhat long winded--what do you expect for politicians--but make some interesting points. The pace is not always fast but the story will definitely pull you in with its great depth.With its mystery and courtroom scenes, Buffa is going places Grisham hasn't even thought about.Keep it up.Highly recommended."
1,Booooooring,"What has happened to this author? His first two books were great, but his last three books have all been the same, long winded. George V. Higgins comes to mind. Antonelli gets a case, goes out and has 3 or 4 long talks with witness's and than he's ready for court. Not one cop shows up in his plots. No forensic work, no investigators of any kind. Why did Buffa mess with all of the wonderfull cast of characters he had in the first two novels? Those were good reads. Don't waste your money on this hardback. For that mater the paperback either when it comes out."
2,Forget it!,"This is really SLIGHT stuff! Aside from ""Depuis le jour,"" there's not much here. Naxos has done a good job of the sound transfer -- but what can you do when the music is as weak as this. It's no wonder this has gone out of the repertoire all over the world. No opera company today (or record company either) would spend the money to mount a production."
2,a disapointing pack,"This pack is definitely not a very good pack. There are only a few good cards like Relinquished (still, not a very good card), Megamorph, and Axe of Despair. All three of those cards can be found in starter decks (Relinquished in the Pegasus deck, Megamorph in the Kaiba evolution deck, and Axe of Despair in the Yugi evolution deck. It's also a little bit of money for something that isn't worth buying. Don't listen to the people that say that cards like Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, and Toon Summoned Skull are good! Trust me on this, I made it to the finals of a tournament without Toons. When I first opened one of these packs, I thought I would get something great, but I didn't. To wrap it up, this is a bad buy. If you want some good cards, buy some Invasion of Chaos packs insted of these."
2,magic ruler basher,"Of all the booster packs for yugioh this is perhaps the worst. the only good cards in this deck are: Axe of despair, Relinqueshed, Megamorph, and maybe a few more. The other thing is that all the good rare cards can be found in other decks, Pegasus starter deck, and you need not waste money on this series."
5,One of the BEST Sweet Valley Books,"I gave this book 5 stars because of the suspense, and scarieness! This book is very good and is one of my favorite books in this series. If you like suspensful books then I most definetly recomend this book!"
3,Frightening? Not!,"Am I the only one who doesn't think the book was at all frightening! I read all four and I was not scared and my heart was not pumping faster! It was confusing too. I mean if Eva was not dead shoudn't she be older and bigger by now.I think she should be taller then the twins and she must have outgrown her clothes and slippers. Its silly! And how did she managed to enter their dreams? If it says that Eva was a ghost, I would believe it . So, the books were not scary and I will not recommend it."
5,Scary But Exciting!,"I love This Book.I'ts like a cliffhanger for me.And unlike the other books,it's sort of like a mystery in a way.Elisabeth and Jessica are being attacked by a monster in thier dreams and it won't go away.Because of something the twins mother did many years ago.............. You have to read it to find out! See ya, Brandi"
5,Only gummi bears I will ever eat!,I will only buy these type of gummi bears. The Haribo brand has an awesome quality and flavor to them that is uncomparable to all the other gummi bear brands I have had....I love that I can order a 5lb bag and have it delivered to my door! It is a better deal than buying them at the store. When certain stores have them on sale for 99 cents I usually stock up but now I don't have to!
5,Great deal on my favorite candies!,"WOW. That's what I said when this huge bag of Haribo gummy bears landed on my porch. I was slightly afraid that it would arrive at my home in one huge globby mess, but lo and behold, it got here just fine. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bears weren't sticking to each other very much at all--as soon as I brought them into the house, the first thing i did was transfer them to tupperware containers (and put a batch in the freezer for frozen gummy bear treats), they lasted me a good 3 weeks! I was the only person to eat them, so if you have a family then I'd imagine they'd go a lot more quickly. All in all a great buy! And if you know you love these (but really, who doesn't?) then it just makes more sense to buy them in bulk this way. 5 stars!"
5,Haribo bears,These are the Gummi bear gold standard to say the least. Delivery was prompt and the pricing is reasonable and the product is great.
2,5 lb Gummi Bear,"This package arrived in Florida on a lovely June day. All the little bears had fused into a single five pound gelatinous block. I'm sure that I will find something to do with it, but it will not be what I had planned when I ordered this package."
1,So hard! Not edible!,"Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound BagMaybe I haven't had gummy bears in a while, but I don't remember them being this hard. Oh well 4.99 lbs to go...."
3,"Weeellll, they're O.K...","Once upon a time (about 20 years ago) I was able to buy gourmet gummi bears from a kiosk in a local mall that knocked the socks off these. I was able to choose my flavors, too. Ah, for the good old days! I hate to be the Philistine amidst all these raves, but I just can't seem to get excited about these gummi bears. They are so rubbery that they seem hard to bite into, so of course they are also kind of hard to taste. I didn't notice any light dusting to keep them from sticking together, either. I'm just glad my grandkids like them, because I would have a heck of a time eating this whole 5-pound bag by myself otherwise!"
2,ok gummies,"my bag was not very fresh at all,i have all gummy products and this is my only bad purchase,i love when its fresh these are like almost hard..........."
3,"more of a packing issue, but important for food item.","I have ordered this gold-bears with another bag of raspberries, both are 5lb bags. When they arrived, the gold-bears bag was taped together with a clear tape. I had originally thought it was just a random piece of tape. When I looked closely, I saw the bag was cut open and the tape was sort of holding all the bears in. The bag must've accidentally got cut opened at some point and taped together before it was even packed for shipping. I was disappointed. The shipping package was not damaged at all. So it looks like some one in the Amazon packing department decided that this is safe to ship this to the customer. I contacted the customer department and they were easy to work with. I needed the candy for kids' party, they offered to ship one-day but I didn't want to risk for another damaged bag. Maybe next time I'll think twice about buying a big bag."
2,Seriously think about how hard you like gummy candy.,"I was so anxious to eat these gummy candies, but after a couple of bites with all the members in my family. We agree that these hurt our teeth =(. You have to really enjoy thick gumminess to truly enjoy these. I guess i just got unlucky."
3,NOT VEGETARIAN,I found these in a vegetarian search and just wanted to make it clear that Haribo gummies are NOT VEGETARIAN.
2,not 5 pounds,so when i got my gummy bears i noticed that something just wasn't right about the bag and so i had weighted it and it was not 5 pounds at all!!! and so i began to cry because it was 4.13 pound instead of 5. but over all it is really good. i am very sorry if i spell thing wrong. btw just in case you want to send me another one. you can contact me at my email. but if you do send me more make sure it is 5 pound because when i get it i will make sure it will be 5 pounds so please do not make me cry again. <333thank you
5,5 pounds!!!,There is no way you can go wrong. You buy this bag and you have all the fun in the world while you are at home or on the road. They are the perfect balance of sweetness and gumminess (yea it's not a word but who cares)!! Haribo makes the best gummi bears on the planet. I won't eat any other gummi bear.
4,Danger - 5lbs of Gummy,"And that is how I started putting on so much weight. Ok, I have a few weaknesses in my life and gummy candy is one of them. My coworker and I decided to go in on a 5lbs bag of these. Big mistake, I went through that bag really fast (two weeks maybe). The candy was great, so why the four stars? Four stars because I need to point the finger at someone for the extra pounds I put on at the time (in this day and age why would I take responsibility for my actions, haha). Ok, but seriously, what would help is if these came in a resealable bag.Hum, anything else? Yes, you can find these gummis at any drugstore. Go buy a bag if you are not sure, then order if you want to put your self on a path of eating more candy. Yummmmy =p"
1,Do Not reccommend,I received the package of gummy bears inside another bag. The original package was open and the gummy bears were spilling out to the second bag. The gummy bears are hard and there is no refund policy. Not impressed at all. Will not buy again.
4,Overall Pretty Good,"The quality of the gummy bears is great, I'd give that five stars. The only problem I had with the product is that the bag came ripped open and inside another bag. I did weigh the bag on a digital scale and did the math, and I'm only missing about ten or so gummy bears, so obviously not something to complain about. I was a bit worried that they'd be stale with the bag being ripped, but they were fine. They were actually softer and chewier than some of the smaller bags I find at grocery stores."
5,Haribo gummis,"This was a great purchase!!! We all love these in our house but have been unable to find them around here. What a bonus to find them sold in 5-lb. bags. So, of course I had to get us each our own bag. We got them shipped quickly in time for Christmas!"
1,One big melted mess.,One big melted mess of gummy goo. I will be going to the store next time I want some gummies.
1,Horrible Packages,"I ordered two bags of Haribo Gummi Bear and the package arrived on time. However, once I opened the box I realized the original bags were opened and the gummy bears were hardened. I was so upset about this order."
2,pick another one,"These gummies are really hard compared to any gummy i've had. I now hate gummy bears, don't think oh i'm going to order these gummies because i love gummy bears!! No you'll hate yourself. Looking at this picture even makes me think WHYYYY."
2,Not that great,"Personally, I think they could be softer. Maybe they were stale? I dont know but I was not pleased with how hard these gummies were. The flavor is just ok. My kids seem to prefer the kind you buy in a box at the grocery (with characters on them) to these."
1,gummi glob,"I ordered the gummi bears and I recieved a gummi blob. I contacted amazon and they said they would sent me another order for free.Guess what?! I now have two gummi blobs.If you live in a warm climate,careful you may end up with a gummi blob."
1,Tasty Rubber,"I expected something softer in texture, but these are like chewing on rubber with flavor. Much too hard for my 3 y/old child. If you're looking for something tasty & softer in texture, try Kasugai Gummy Candies."
1,Not my taste...,"With all the rave reviews, I was really excited about these gummy bears. The flavor is good, but the texture is what really turns me on to gummy candy. Unfortunately these were too chewy for me and they didn't go over well with my friends either. I guess it's all about personal preference. I'll look elsewhere for my candy."
5,Best type of gummy bear!,"If you really want good gummy bears, you can't really get any better than the ""gold"" standard, Haribo Gold-Bears. I have always found these gummy bears to have a step up in flavor and possess just the right amount of chewiness- not too stiff, but not too soft either. On top of all this, Amazon offers a great price in terms of value. If you were to buy the equivalent amount of gummy bears in 5 oz. bags for around $1.50 each, you would end up spending $24 as opposed to the roughly $15 that Amazon charges. On the flip side, willpower is probably a good quality to possess before purchasing, seeing as a five pound bag doesn't offer much in the way of deterrence from binging. Also, make sure to store these bears in an airtight or almost airtight bag, or they will become stiffer as they lose moisture. Overall though, a great value purchase for the best gummy bear available!"
4,good stuff,"My boyfriend brought me several small bags of Haribo gummy bears from Germany recently. These are the same and are good. I was going to have him get me a big bag the next time he went over, but now I don't have to... he can bring chocolate now!"
5,"Great bears, great price!",This product was perfect for my daughter's 4th grade report on Germany. She gave away gummi bears to show a sampling of a German product. Lots of bears for a great price!
3,Buyer Beware...,"While there is nothing wrong with these, please keep in mind that Haribo gummies purchased in different countries have drastically different ingredients. These are considered healthy snacks in Germany because they are made with real fruit juice. Even the Haribo brand gummies purchased in the U.S. are not made with fruit juice. So, while I'm disappointed that I can't get what my niece has the privilege of eating in Germany, this is the best gummi in the U.S."
3,"Haribos are the BEST, however....","Haribos are my all-time favorite gummy bears. I was really excited that it came in such a big amount. HOWEVER, when the gummy bears arrived, they didn't taste or feel fresh. When I first opened them, it was hard and chewy. I guess it's always best to buy in person and feel them before you buy them. =)"
5,Haribo gummi bears-the best!,These are the best gummi bears to buy! They are fresh and will remain fresh if you place them in an airtight container after you open them. They're a great price and will always be my favorites.
1,Not so gummy bears,"I received the Gummy Bears today and couldn't wait to ""gum them"" but they were hard and not ""gummy"" at all. The package stated "" best if used by September of 2012"". I think it should have said best if used by 2000!! I think they were old!! I couldn't send them back because they were opened. I definitely don't want to get more of them every month so need to figure out how to discontinue the automatic resend!!"
1,US Gummies made with artificial colors and flavors,"Unfortunately these came up in my search for German gummy bears but when they arrived they were the US version complete with artificial colors and flavors. Real German gummies use all natural colors and flavors so they taste much better. Haribo makes crappy US candy, stick with European."
1,I Blew Chunks,"I ordered this 5 pound bag of Gummi Bears and ate them while watching basketball games one weekend. Yep, ate the whole bag. I then blew chunks all over the carpet. Yep, I woofed, I puked. Some of my vomit even got onto Eric's shoes, the guy who was sitting next to me, as well as my own shoes. I could see tiny chunks of chewed up gummy bears in my barf. So, I don't recommend that you buy this 5 pound bag unless you want to heave all over your own carpet and shoes. Its not worth it, unless you do want to regurgitate on Eric's shoes."
4,Big Bag o' Gummi Bears,"The Gummi Bears were tasty, just as expected. The only drawback was the packaging: the bag was not resealable. I ended up transferring the candy to Ziploc bags."
3,"Great gummy bears, not too great of a price.","I bought this thinking it was going to be a lot of gummy bears, just to have at work. But turns out that 5 pounds isn't as much as I thought it would be, a co-worker and I finished these in about a week. I thought $15 was a great price for the amount but it really is not. I have gone to other stores such as Target and bought some of the generic gummy bears which taste almost exactly the same for about half the price. But then if you really do like the Haribo gummy bears it is a good purchase, but if you are not picky I would suggest you buy some generic ones."
2,Stale,I ordered these just to have a lot of gummies. I did wait till after the summer so I didn't worry about them being melted. They arrived nice and quick no issues there. Started eating them and they are stale hard to chew. Not the soft chewy funniest I was hoping for. It is my fault for not ever trying to return them. Oh well stick with buying from a store locally then you don't spend so much on them and the shipping.
5,Great gummy bear,This is one of the best gummy bear I've tried so far. It's not too sweet. 1 bag was gone within a week. Yummy!
5,DELICIOUS,"delicious, fresh, yummy goodness!!! I was addicted and got sick of buying those small packs (and $ adds up as well), so I just went for this big thing. Best decision ever!"
5,YUM!,May be one of my husband's favorite gifts that I have ever bought him! He loved that not only was it a 5 pound bag of gummi bears but it was haribo too!
5,Yummy.,These bears are amazing. got them for a xmas present. and mmmm he said they are good good price to.
4,A happy child,"I bought these to fill up my sons party bags. These are one of my son's favorite sweets and they look great in his party bag that I made. I recommend these, they are yummy."
5,Excellent Candy and Free Shipping,"This is excellent candy. They can melt in your mouth. For the price, however, do not pay shipping and handling. Make sure you get they Free Shipping. Otherwise, they are too expensive."
5,These Gummy Bears Rule!,I've tried every Gummy bear out there and these by far are the best. Love them! Not too soft or too hard. They are perfect. Only problem is that once I start eating them I can't stop.
5,gummy bears,well they are gummy bears. you cant really go wrong. the flavor is great and they came nice and fresh.
1,Hard gummy bears are not good,"These arrived stale. Bag appeared to be intact, which indicates they were just very old. Not a good experience, and price at SAMs club appeared to be better too."
2,Chewing jerky bear,"It was hard when it arrived. It took awhile to soften up, even then, it was still hard. It was like chewing on beef jerkey. Not worth the sale price."
5,Must... Stop... Eating,These bears are so good it should be a crime. I had to lock them away from myself to stop from eating more than a pound at a time. Very great price and very delicious.
4,I Love Haribo Gummy Bears,"I love Haribo gummy bears and although 5 lbs may be alot I love to put them into little snack bags and store them at work, in the car, and in my bookbag when I need to study. I got it at a great price for $11.50 but I did see a 3 lb bag at Target for $6 which is a little cheaper and you don't have to buy so much at a time."
5,Nice little treat for the kids--and yourself,"These gummis are by far the best; the taste is tart and sweet, and the consistency is yes, gummy but not sticky. The bears resist the teeth with a pleasant rubbery consistency. And the outside is lightly dusted to prevent sticking together--however, they will melt with high temperatures in the Texas summer. They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way.A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear. They are great for teaching counting, too. Or getting things done. Put a bowl of gummis out and an empty bowl next to it. When one task is done, put a gummi in the empty bowl. At the end of your list, eat the gummis. Yummi."
5,Directly opposed to previous review,"I'm giving these a 5-star rating specifically because they are not vegetarian.This is to counteract the fact that somebody gave them a 1-star rating for the same reason.Also, they are delicious.So is steak."
3,Haribo Gold Bears 5-pound bag,"It would have been good for me to know the ingredients prior to purchasing. I expected the German-made version which has real fruit extracts. This 5-pound bag is from Hungary and contains artificial and ""natural"" flavors instead. The difference in taste is noticeable, not to mention the obvious advantage for one's health to have something with real fruit rather than something with flavor.On a side note, expect to pay a lot for shipping. There appears to be no land option, airmail only. But, that might depend on whether you live in the same country as the retailer or not.I realized after the purchase that I would save 30-40% by purchasing the small bags at a local store that imports them from Germany."
1,Pay for what you get,"Great price...not so great product. No volume control on machine...very HARD to figure out for the technically challanged...had an IPOD, and a Creative zen V plus! Sticking eith the creative Zen,"
2,Worked great for two months,"I loved this little guy when I got it, does everything. Then it started loading everything REALLY slow, and then eventually it just stopped all together, it says hard drive not found.Still awaiting to see if I can get the warranty honored, only 2 months old."
1,"Good watch, but not for myself... at least this time","Well, I liked everything about this watch comparing with other watches on the net. When I received the watch after 9 days - cause I chose the free shipping, It was out of order, or defected one, called citizen customer service trying to fix it without going thru the hassle of returning the product. After several hours of frustration, it is now being sent back to Amazon for a full refund. I will see how the refund process will be completed in a timely, professional manner by Amazon which my next purchase with Amazon will be based on...."
5,Great Watch,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I find this to be an excellent time piece, without any major flaws. The digital display is small, but easy to read, plenty of contrast. Once you spend some time with it, setting it is easy. The alarm signal is soft, and while it may not wake you up, it is great for timing meditation sessions or other applications where you don't want a loud signal.The analog displays automatically adjusts to the digital... only need to set the digital. Lots of easy to access features. My watch performs very well; it loses 3 seconds per month against an atomic clock. Correcting for any variation is easy.Only draw back: the luminous hands are difficult to see at night. You won't get many clicks from geiger counter held up to the glowing pieces on the face.The Watch is great to look at. It works very well with either casual and formal dressHighly recommended, although it is probably not the watch for everyone."
5,cool and professional,"This watch is both very cool and very professional looking at the same time. The only problem is set-up: it's a bear to program the day/date,etc. A cd is provided, but you need lots of time (and reading glasses).Do your homework and check around for a good price. This is a popular watch and prices fluctuate (sometimes by the hour). But it's a great watch to add to your collection or for everyday."
4,Good watch - missing a thing or two,Excellent watch for the price and provides lots of great functionality at your finger tips for active pilots.Would like to set labels for various time zones myself instead of pre-defined labels. Also would be nice to see a date without having to choose between date or a different time zone.
5,It Just Runs and Runs,"I bought this watch fresh out in December 2002 and Nearly 8 years later this watch is still running perfectly. Worn everyday, the face is still virtually scratch free and the titanium band only has minor scratches.Its a joy to use for someone who travels alot. You can change your time instantly at the push of a button by selecting your current city/location.Since I had this watch at least three of my friends have made a similar purchase with no regrets.Maybe in two years I will pass it on and upgrade to the atomic version.Keep up the good work Citizen."
3,"some oddities, but plenty of full length hits too","This volume of the 3 disc series isn't ripe with many big hits, but it has enough to make it worth the purchase. All of them are full length 12"" versions!!! Other volumes are titled ""More More More"" and ""So Excited."" Track times are:1. turn the beat around (5:33)2. happiness is just around the bend (6:19)3. mainline (6:56)4. don't tell me tell her (5:15)5. behind the mask (6:30)6. automatic (6:06)7. express yourself (11:42)8. grooving you (6:15)9. dancin' (7:04)10. I don't know anybody else (7:02)11. I don't know if it's right (6:17)"
3,Haribo crocos,These do not compare with the similar types that can be found in Europe. These are harder. The European ones are smaller and softer and are a pleasure to chew. These are not. They taste the same though and are a good replacement if you crave Haribo's magic gummies...
2,Colossal Crocs not classic Haribo flavor,"I love the green and white Haribo frogs, so I was expecting these Colossal Crocs to be even better, since they come in different colors. Unfortunately, they taste very artificial, typical of generic American gummies. I was quite disappointed that Haribo would sell such an inferior item when most of their products are the gold standard of gummies."
5,yummy and fresh,"These were a great buy and for those who like gummy critters, these are a large mouthfull. Very fresh and good. Wish there were more red and not so many green."
5,"The Best there is,The Best There Was and Ever will be.","As a Bret Hart fan and a Wrestling fan,I cannot wait till this comes out and like others have been waiting for a long time.Bret deserves this tribute to his career and this will be in my prediction one of the Top Selling Wrestling Sets of all time.As Lance Storm said,this should be mandatory viewing for any person getting into the business.1.No one ever got hurt while in the ring with Bret,always protected his fellow worker.2.How to be over with the fans and how also to be a Heel,Bret excelled at both,no matter which role he played.3.Bret truly a Gentleman outside of the ring as well,so if your a Wrestling fan,buy this Dvd and own a piece of Wrestling History.Bret Hart is in this fans opinion one of the top three Greatest Performers in the History of the Business."
3,NOT the Best,Bret Hart was really a mediocre performer. He's better than everyone else only in his own mind.
2,What a crybaby!,"Just when you think you hear the end of Bret Hart, he comes out with a dvd. He was a great aerial and mat wrestler, his only problem was opening up his mouth. H e is such a complainer, I couldnt stand him and will never stand him. I am rating this with 2 stars only because the formatting/order in which everything is shown is well put together"
3,"Great wrestler,but one big *** crybaby",Yes Bret Hart is an great wrestler.No doubt.Professionally he is almost one of the greatest to lace up an pair of boots.But personally I never liked the guy and probably never will.Bret thinks the sun rises and shines on his *** likes hes the greatest thing to hit the generation but he sure as hell is not.Brets cockiness goes to no end and thats turns him off as an true legend to some people.
5,One of the best dvd sets!!!,This is simply one of the best dvd sets out there right now. Three discs of bret hart and everything you would like to know about him. I would have liked to see other matchs instead of what they included. Only other dvd set that comes close is the ric flair set.
2,not good enough,"Why Bret Hart skip to choose so many great matches instead of boring ones.He forgot about these matches:vs Ric Flair, and his first wwe title.vs Rowdy Roddy Piper in Wrestlemania 8.vs Shawn Michael in Survivor Series 92.vs Razor Ramon in Royal rumble 93, a nice to remember.vs Jerry the King Lawler in Summerslam 93.vs Lex Luger.vs Owen Hart (steel cage)in Summerslam 94.vs Bob Backlund (i quit match) in wrestlemania 11.vs Jerry the King Lawler (kiss my foot) in King of the Ring 95.Vs Steve Austin in Survivor Series 96.vs Undertaker in Summerslam 97.vs Shawn Michaels in Survivor Series 97.and of course his WCW matches with....Sting, Hogan, Goldberg."
5,best there ever will be,"This was an awesome three disc dvd set. Bret Hart was the man, and deserved the credit for keeping the WWF afloat during a very trying period in wrestling. this is a must have for true pro wrestling fans."
1,horrible!!,This is one of the most horrible books ever written on Latin America. Its mixture of political theory with empirical analysis is too confusing. Don't loose your time with it.
4,great trap,"Now in all honesty I have no reason to own this trap other than pure entertainment, its sits on my desk and that's about it. I am an outdoors person and do camp and hike frequently but I'm not gonna go out and trap if its just for fun. It does rust so you are going to need to oil it like anything else that is exposed metal. But this thing is the real deal it will trap and hold to what I think is a coyote sized animal, it is easy to set and use but I warn you keep your fingers away from this thing when set, the snap seems more than strong enough to put you in the hurt box for a while"
3,No Instructions?,"Bought this to show to my scouts. I am a complete novice and this was for entertainment (and a don't do drugs analogy). I was a bit stunned when I opened the box and there were no instructions. I guess I am not man enough to try to figure this out on my own. If anyone has some instructions or a place to find them, please help."
5,An Amazing Book,"I read this book for a school report, and I didn't expect it to be very good. After I read the first page, I was hooked. I couldn't stop reading! Somehow, Haugaard combined history, action, sadness, joy, romance, and wisdom all in one amazing book. This book is the best book I have ever read, and don't let anyone tell you any diffrent."
4,How this book influenced my life,"This book that influenced my life A Samurais tale by Eric G. Haugaard, addresses the Habbit of mind Intellectual Curiosity because I've always wondered what life was like back in the fuedal age of japan as seen through the eyes of a Samurai. This book tells the story of how a young boy,Murikami whos father(a samurai)killed in battle is given a life as a peasent, but later in the book he gains the rank of samurai.I recomend this book to people who like to know about history and japan"
3,a seventh grade point of view,I thought this book was not very exciting but it was historicly accurate and provided an insite on the life styls of the samurai and thier obstacles in life. I wouldn't recomend to read this outloud but maybe induvudually and the do a small fun project on it.
4,A young servant boy keeps his dream to be a samurai.,"In English class in 6th grade, our teacher lent us copies of The Samurai's Tale to read. Through the book, the orphan, Taro, has many different positions and jobs. He was a servant, helping a cook named Togan. With Togan, Taro learned many things, including to accept his position and be polite. Then he worked as a stable boy for Lord Akiyama and later became a messenger in Iida Caslte. Taro also has many adventures. He meets a ghost and even falls in love. We thought this book was really interesting, though in some parts it got a little boring. We recommend this book to people who know a little of Japan and who like historical fiction."
2,I read it for a school project and it was very bad.,"I had to read this book when my class was studying Japan. I hated it because it was so boring. The majority of my class thought it was boring also. The story is about a boy who was a samurai's son and then he was turned into a servant. After many boring chapters, he became a samurai. It sounds like an interesting book with lots of excitement. There is almost no plot. Nothing happens that is actually interesting. I made a survey in my school to see what people thought of the book. Most people thought it was boring and pointless."
2,So-so,"I had to read this book for an 8th grade book critique. This book was BORING. So boring that in the end i skipped 4 chapters just to be done with it. I dont know why everyone else thought it was good but MAN, it isnt. didnt even know what was going on half the time cause it was so bad."
4,An exceptional book,"I had to read this book for literature. I was confused at first, very confused actually. But then i kept on reading it and it really didn't seem that bad. If you were to get a choice to which book to read, and the Samurai's Tale was one of them, get it"
5,A review of The Samurai's Tale by Erik Christian Haugaard,This great adventure through feudal Japan and the history of the Takeda family wraps you up from the start and never lets you go. It is a story of a young samurai's son and his fall from grace. He vows to return to the status which he knew as a little boy and be considered an equal of the highest ranking lords' sons. This story beautifully describes his many troubles and triumphs along the path to his redemption. It is a tale you won't forget. If you are a fan of 16th century Japan and it's tales or of great books in general this is one you won't want to miss.
3,"Pretty Pictures, but Beware the Text!","Beautiful pictures will inspire you and spark your imagination, but the omissions in the text may cause you to pick the wrong plant for your situation. Running Cedar only ""presents a clean weedless look"" if there is no competition at all from other plants and you happen to have the exact, unique conditions it requires to thrive. Hall's Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) is not merely ""as vigorous as a weed"" it is a pest and is on every state detrimental invasive plant list I've seen. Morning glories are pretty and it's true ""nothing grows faster"", but he leaves out that nothing seeds in more and becomes a pest more quickly. Honeysuckle 'Dropmore Scarlet' is touted as ""a rampant grower"" that will ""smother everything in its path"", when actually it is very wellbehaved, especially compared to the others listed above. So, enjoy the pictures, get some ideas, and buy a really good and responsible reference book."
2,Over and over and over and over and over and over...,"I bought this CD by mistake. I was trying to get ""Don't Stop"" by the Freestylers. Appearantly they have another song called ""Don't Stop the Rock"" which is feature PROMINANTLY (understatement) on this CD.I've tried to listen to it quite a few times in my car, but it just seems to be the same song over and over again. Sure, they remix it nine ways to Sunday, but deep down, it's still the same song.Don't make the same mistake I did. If you're looking for the popular song I was looking for, check out the ""We Rock Hard"" CD by the Freestylers."
3,Better Sausage Than Some,"I love breakfast sausage, but have had difficulty in finding sausage that is just right. I tried Esposito's Finest Quality, even though it is expensive and was a large amount for a trial, in hopes it would be excellent. I am disappointed with the result. Overall the sausage is of high quality, but contains a lot of fat and its flavor comes mostly from salt. I would prefer less fat, but more importantly, better flavor- less salt, but more sage and other sausage seasonings. There is no accounting for taste and many people raved about this sausage so it is obviously right for many if not most people. Maybe that's why I can't find sausage I like, because my taste is not main stream. I will not purchase this product again, but have nothing against Esposito. In fact they sent a package of their Italian sausage as a sample and we loved it! I will look at the other items they offer and may purchase some of those, but I am still in the search for my kind of breakfast sausage!"

4,good old porky,"great movie.boys will be boys. yes sex no drugs some rock n roll.this is like animal house, like private school. good old movie."
3,Piranaha Blues,"This effort had a fine assembly of talent. I was expecting something beyond maybe Lovin' Touching' Squeezin' ala Journey, maybe more snappy than Stevie Ray, or ZZ Top. It just wasn't Bluesy enough. Neal was Neal, but the song selection was crappy. I gave it three stars for the recording quality."
5,Neal tearing it up!! MUST BUY,"As a big fan of Journey's first 3 records and knowing how Neal is such a great player with a killer tone it is great to hear him playing the crap out of his guitar. I loved Beyond the Thunder and Electric World but this is how I like Neal best. The singer sounds like a cross between Warren Haynes and Paul Rodgers. Neal, if you read this thanks for a great cd and please keep this band together for more cd's and maybe even a tour."
2,Blues is not Neal's forte...,"Although Neal is one of the best guitarists to ever grace a stage...or a recording studio, he has missed the mark with this one. Just what were you thinking, Neal, when you chose this singer. His voice is like fingernails on the proverbial chalkboard. Except for a couple of good solos here and there, this album is far from Neal's best. For those wanting to hear his better post-Journey work, tune in and turn on to ""Beyond the Thunder"" and ""Electric World"". Those two are guaranteed not to disappoint..."
3,The art of being silly,"I remember watching this for the first time as a little tyke on my parents' small black and white television on one of those late-night monster fests in the sixties. Before I watched it again many, many years later (on this DVD release), my only memory was that the ""monster"" gave me the creeps (being only five or six years old at the time, it was understandable). So, mainly for nostalgia reasons, I purchased the DVD when I happened to come across it. Watching it again was totally enjoyable. It's very silly, but a good silly. Highly recommended for fans of cheap, old ""horror"" movies.As for the DVD itself: A fine print, accompanied with an entertaining and informative booklet. As I said, if you're a fan of this type of movie, do yourself a favor and buy it. Then, late one night, when you're bored and everyone else is fast asleep, curl up on the couch with a coke and popcorn and pop it in. It's a great way to end your day."
1,Lack of Plot meets Bad Acting,"Ok, this one actually hurts to watch. I thought that Plan 9 was the bottom of the barrel, but this goes way beyond that."
1,"Beware , Ed Wood!","This movie gives Ed Woods worst a run for it's money. Low budget, bad acting, dopey dialogue, awful special effects, and ridiculous plot all conspire to make this a truly awful movie."
1,"not even so bad it's good,just BAD!!",i thought this would at least be funny! wrong!!! just bad and the print is the worst!!!
3,A must for hard core britten fans,"The concept of basing each scene of this chamber opera on a set of variations is a fascinating one. But its basically an intellectual excercise. This is one of Britten's most sterile scores. He wrote it quickly and it shows. The piece, based on a famous tale, works in the theater so it has held the stage. The cast of this recording is a group of top notch professionals so it is satisfying on that level. Just don't expect to be swept up in it like one can be with ""Peter Grimes."""
2,Not good for use with all families,"This book has beautiful pictures, and is good at teaching deep breathing. What I did not like, was that it sent the message that being mindful makes everything better. This is not the case, especially when the book is used in therapeutic situations. It also specifices how ""beautiful"" mother is, and how ""wonderful"" father is. This book is not appropriate for all family constilations."
2,"I like the idea of this book, but my kid has never wanted to finish it.","Lovely thought. Nothing to engage a child. I bought this book nearly 5 years ago and my child has never cared to get to the end. She's doesn't even like plots, the drama of a plot troubles her. But there is nothing to engage a child in this book for five minutes. Save your money and just meditate."
2,de-icer guard,The item arrived on time. It fits the de-icer. The company that makes the de-icer should just include it: it is silly to make the buyer purchase from two separate places and then assemble it.
1,Damaged,"My pond heater and this guard ""heater"" floater was received with a missing part and broken wire rack. The reason was because both items were jammed in one box lest resulting in broken wires and missing connecting spiral to hold the heater to the wire rack. I wrote two letters to your shipping department inquiring and received no reply."
2,Out of the Dust Lit Plan on CD,"Just got this CD, was not happy. If all you want to do is read and write it's fine. It talks about extra activities but does not include word searches, crosswords, etc. I believe in the description it lists word searches and crosswords but if they're there I didn't see them. Wish I could have seen an example before I spent $20. Don't waste your money on this. The paperback from Teacher Created Resources is much better (and a lot cheaper)."
5,Satellite radio armband,"I actually have the black/yellow armband, however, it is the same product. I love the armband. It is easy to tighten (one handed)on your arm. It protects the satellite radio very well. I have had absolutely no problems with product. It fits very comfortably on your arm and holds on tight very well. The armband and ring stay in place and do not get twisted when tightened. The plastic does not cover the keypad or joy wheel (I now have a Pioneer XMP3 player) and you have access to change stations. I would most certainly buy this product again."
4,Handy fold-away stand,"This stand is perfect for packing with the item you wish to place on this foldaway stand. I use it mainly for my Asus Transformer 10"" tablet but is perfect for digital frames, etc. as well. Adjustable back support to accommodate any viewing angle. Allows for rotation of the device you wish to hold up. Adjustments stay in place pretty well with a click action. Of course, applying too much touch pressure on the device being held may push back a click changing your set viewing angle. Not really an issue as the stand is pretty strong and one does not need to slam touch a tablet. Very good item for me, I use it always. Takes up little space when folded."
5,"What I needed all along for my ipad, thanks!","This is the best ipad holder I have tried so far. I primarily use my ipad at home, this holds it perfectly! So easy, small and lightweight too!"
5,Great portable stand,"I use this for reading my Nook at lunch. It's a great design, holds securely and does not slide due to nonskid rubber in strategic places. It's adjustable in many ways and holds my Nook at an angle so there is no glare off the screen. I've only had it for a couple of months but it seems to be very sturdy and I expect it to last for a long time.I'm going to buy some more for gifts to my family."
4,"Very cheaply made, I expect a short life","It's a $5 item in my opinion, very cheaply made and will probably break within a few weeks to months if you frequently adjust the legs. If you leave it in place, it might last a year or so is my guess."
5,A No Brainer,"I keep this on my coffee table to put my iPad in. Keeps the iPad vertical, handy, and visible. There a rubber pad along the edges for a no-slip effect. It sits there securely. This item is a steal at this price."
4,Portable stand,I bought 2 stands for our ipads and we love them. Them are quite durable and fold up small for travel!
5,Great Stand for Office or Travel,"This is an incredible product. I love this stand and have recommend it to all of my friends with iPads. It is so versatile, it holds the iPad in so many different positions and the iPad can even be charged on this stand, if needed. It folds up and travels well in my iPad travel case. I use this stand every day in my office and it is still like new. Very durable. It is simple yet elegant. My wife bought me the Apple iPad stand, which I use to charge the device overnight, but I prefer this one in my office because of all the different positions it can assume.I highly recommend this stand."
5,Great Portable Stand,"Great portable stand. In my opinion, the item description nails it. It is very portable when folded up; can be easily tossed in a drawer or bag. It held my iPad perfectly while in its case and is sturdy enough to operate. It didn't slide around the counter tops and is adjustable for different viewing angles. It pretty much suits all of my requirements. However, my one minor complaint is that when the iPad is sitting vertically in the mount and the charging cable is plugged in, the cable interferes with the stability of the iPad. In other words, if the mount held the iPad maybe just a half-inch higher off the surface, the plug wouldn't be a problem. Horizontally is of course no problem. I personally don't find this to be an issue as I seldom have it plugged in when I'm using it anyway."
5,ideal,Keep my ipad now on the kitchen counter. This take hardly any space and good to skpe family while cooking!
5,Great little Stand!!,I ordered this stand for my iPad 4th Gen 64gb wifi/4g and it Does the job!! and the Price was right! I'm Not paying Apple 50.00 or more for a stand when I don't need to!!
3,It wobbles a bit ...,"It works pretty well, however it would be great if it were just a little more stable. Otherwise, it's fine!"
3,one of many,I thought this would be good for holding kindle while I was reading but not really.I do use it on my night stand which is better than just laying it down.
5,arkon foldup stand,very handy item we use it with two different size tabletsadjusts to watching or typing positionsfolds up to travel very nice
5,Works well.,"Just received the stand and used it on a table. An important feature for me was the multiple positioning of the back support which can be made to reach all the way to support the top end of the ipad when it is in vertical position giving the ipad stability when pushing on the top end of the screen. Other stands which allow for either the vertical or horizontal positioning of the ipad, the back supports barely come halfway up, which I would imagine makes them unstable when pushing at the top end of the vertical screen. The rubberized surfaces grip well, preventing the stand from slipping even when pushing hard on the screen. The grooves to hold the bottom end of the ipad are deep, holding the ipad safely, and positioned so that the access to the ""on-off"" button is not compromised. The grooves make it easy to move the ipad on to and out of the stand. I am looking forward to using it, especially when travelling because it is very sturdy, compact and lightweight."
5,Works well with Asus Transformer,"Asus Transformer fits well, padding on the stand hits it in all the right places, very stable in both horizontal and vertical positions."
5,Elegant simplicity makes for an easy win,"I bought this for use with the Acer Iconia Tab A500. It works great. The stand is easily adjustable, solidly built, has enough grip padding to hold things in place with no worry of scratches, and is pretty inexpensive. No complaints here, it just works. ^_^"
5,Great all around stand,"First off, I though this stand would be a little smaller than it actually is. The good thing is that there are so many angles you can use to utilize your Ipad or android tablet (we got an ipad 2 and a galaxy tab. Both tablets have a sleeve for carrying them around, I have not been a fan of cases very much, therefore the stand was a perfect fit for me. The only advantage I see cases with integrated stand options having is that you can easily use them while they are on your lap. This stand will not work effectively on your lap.Overall a great buy, and arrived in 2 days after purchase! (prime member)"
5,great versital product. i use it for Asus Eee slate,Great sturdy well designed product. I use it for my Said Eee slate and my cell phone so my 2 year old doesn't have to hold the phone its self..
5,Fantastic Motorola Xoom Stand,"For my Motorola Xoom, this stand is amazing. It does a great job in both portrait and landscape and with the adjustable ""v"" base, I'm not afraid my device will tip over regardless of the viewing angle I have it in. If I had to pick on area to complain about, it would be that the size of the Xoom's charging cable's plug means you need to flip the device upside down if you intend to charge in the stand.This really is a well designed, cost effective stand for people like me who hate cases and need a great deal of flexibility. I can't recommend this enough."
3,nice stand,"Nice stand, but not excellent. It is cheap, though. I use it to my kindle, since i got a dock for my iPad, but it works fine for iPad too. Just don't you expect to put the iPad on it AND wirte on the screen. Better get a wireless keyboard for that."
1,It Wobbles,"The stand wobbles. It's unstable on a flat surface. When I try to touch the iPad while it's in the stand, the iPad moves.Either it's a design flaw or was poorly built at their factory. In either case, no quality control check was done before they sent it to me. It's too cheap to bother returning.This is the second Akron product I've bought. The other one was a car dashboard mount for a smart phone. That product also was unusable due too poor quality. I won't buy any more Akron products."
5,Portable Folding Stand,"The portable stand exceeded my expectations. It's extremely portable and very versital. I have used it in so many different situations, it would surprise you. For the price, I would recommend that every person that has a tablet, buy one."
4,Huge but functional,"Are very high perfect for 10"" tablets, not suite very well in 7"" tablets, makes his work and its cheap."
4,Still holding up,"Well, I have had this stand for almost a year now and still holding up well. Some of the padding in the notches has worn off, but I have a really good case on the iPad and scratches aren't an issue. The screws have not loosened up yet, but I do not fold up the stand often. All in all, it's a well made stand I would recommend to friends and family."
5,Brilliant Design,"This little stand deserves all the praise!It ratchets into many positions that make it ideally fit whatever device you want... from the 10"" iPad, 7"" Galaxy Tab, or your smart phone. It folds up to a pocket size about like carrying a common pocket knife. The plastic is not cheap either. It is padded with rubber in the contact areas to protect your device and also on the bottom to keep it from moving around. You can even type with both hands on the virtual keyboard and the stand keeps the tablet firmly in place.Go For It~!"
5,Just right,You have to wonder if those whove given low star reviews were throwing this stand against the wall! This is perfect for a tablet. I have the Acer Iconia A500 and it holds the tab wonderfully. Highly recommended.
5,"Great stand for the Xoom, just one minor issue...","This is a nearly perfect stand for my Xoom. My only complaint is that the stand is too low that when you plug it in to charge while on the stand, the power cable pushes up against the surface and makes it unstable. I'll share a picture of it soon so you can see what I'm talking about. This isn't a huge deal or anything, since I can just stand it up instead of laying it sideways. Great stand though overall. It has soft pads where the device touches it."
5,Great tool,Securely holds the iPad at multiple angles in either orientation. No slip surfaces work great while on the airplane. Folds up into a compact product that easily fits in your pocket or briefcase Highly recommended.
5,Neat little gizmo.,"I use this gadget for holding my iPhone, iPad, cookbooks, or whatever else needs propping up. The flexibility of the design is ingenius and grippy material is located in all the right places. This is great for using FaceTime unless you like holding a phone the whole time.It's not exactly pretty, but I can't imagine not having it!"
5,Perfect!,"I purchased this stand to use with my new iPad and it just works. iPad sits solid in portrait or landscape mode, even with my iPad still inside it's leather case. I also use it with my Kindle (and it is in a leather case as well) and have zero complaints. It is small and lightweight and fits folded into the smallest space, no problem. I highly recommend this product.My only complaint: Considering it is just made from plastic, the price is a bit high."
3,Not as great as it looks,"When I saw this, I thought it was the perfect stand for a tablet. When I actually got it, it was nice and compact, adjustable for any angle and any tablet, but it is not high enough to allow the tablet's cord to be on the bottom of the stand. This means it's impossible to have an iPad plugged in and standing in Portrait mode, or an Asus Transformer to be plugged in in Landscape mode. The other drawback is it's a little flimsy, and wiggles around a lot while you're tapping. It's not nearly as bad as the credit-card size fold-up ones, but it's annoying and can cause your tablet to fall over.Mostly it's great, but hopefully they make a better version."
4,Great stand with only one small flaw,"This is a great little stand. Lightweight, compact, and very sturdy. The ONLY reason I would rate this stand at 4 instead of 5 stars is because the base of the stand comes in contact with the iPad's volume lever, either raising or lowering the volume, when the iPad rests horizontally on its right side. And even at that, the pads of the stand grip the iPad firmly enough that it isn't really that big of an issue. Simply rotating the iPad 180 to its other side solves the problem. Although it is irritating to have the main iPad button on the wrong side, it's a small price to pay."
5,High quality,Larger than I expected but it fits my Nexus 7 and my spouses Galaxy Note 10.1. Adustable and has good quality foam pads for anti-slip and where it makes contact with your device.
4,Afforadble and practical.,"As described in the heading, this device is well worth the low cost. Probably one of the better IPAD accessories for the cost. And wath's nice is that the positions are adjustable to almost any angle."
5,Ipad Stand-Arkon Portable,"This was well worth the money I paid for it, I love the design, fold up real nice, hold the Ipad very sturdy. My Wife loves her's also. Can't beat it for the price. It has real nice foam pads. It's adjustable viewing angle make is real usable."
5,Works great for many devices.,"With a little adjusting I can use this stand for my Ipad, Kindle and Nook Color. I tried using my Ipad keyboard while it was on the stand and it works fine.You can't go wrong for $12.95.I ordered mine from Mount Guys thru their Amazon store. Free shipping and it arrived in 3 days."
5,Perfect iPad stand,"I use this stand every single day. It's lightweight, inexpensive, very versatile (can be used for both landscape and portrait positions), folds up easily and can be tilted to a variety of angles. Extremely portable too. Love this simple but necessary product."
4,Pretty Slick,"I ordered this based on several reviews on Tech Sites, so I hsd a good idea what I was getting.This stand is pretty slick. It is a great design and for the price it cannot be beat.The rubber pads on the base and areas that hold the tablet are a njce touch and show that some thought went into the stand.I will be purchasing some more for stocking stuffers this year."
4,"Good value, does its job, good buy","I bought this because I was tired of holding my iPad in portrait orientation when using Skype or FaceTime. It is adjustable to almost all angles between 90 and 180 degrees. It is larger than I expected, but it does the trick. I can now multi task when using video chat. Made of plastic, foam/rubber inserts where the device contacts the stand. Not disappointed with this purchase. Would get 5 stars if it were slightly cheaper in price."
5,Just what I was looking for...,"I was looking for something that will hold the iPad in portrait AND landscape; but could not find one with adjustable angles. So, I came across this stand and decided to give it a shot.Some Pro's:1. Portable: once its folded, feels like a pocket knife.2. Price and build quality: the iPad feels stable even at 15 degree angle; does not feel like it will tip over.3. You can use it in ""portrait"" and ""landscape"" modes, adjustable angles.4. The stand does not slide on wood or smooth surfaces, it has fake-leathery stuff on the bottom. This same fake-leathery stuff is on the part where the iPad stands, so the iPad wont slide/move.Con's:1. Can not use USB/Power cable in ""portrait"" mode.2. Not sure how many times you can pack/un-pack this stand until it becomes loose."
2,Poorly Designed and Cheap,"Pro's: portable, folds down small, lightweight, fits iPad with a case on, many options for angling iPadCon's: cheaply made plastic, rubber pads come off easy, collapses if a small amount of force from tapping/touching the iPad, at certain angles in portrait mode the charge cord either won't fit comfortably or is bent too much, overpricedBased on the cons mentioned, I'm looking for another stand that is more sturdy so I can tap/touch the iPad screen without worry of collapse and so I can comfortably charge my iPad in either landscape or portraight mode without fear that the cord will crimp. Other than for travel, I wouldn't recommend this poorly designed and manufactured stand."
5,Also works for Viewsonic G tablet,"I saw this on amazon as I was looking for accessories for my Viewsonic G tablet. It looked like it would fit, and it does. I use it to take the tablet with me to work, school, and even work on stuff in restaurants... I would guess that it would even be a great thing to use on the plane, on a tray table.It is adjustable for angle, and it does not cover any of the ports or controls in either portrait or landscape position (although it does cover the volume control if I use it upside down).It is also light weight, but sturdy. I can't say how long it lasts, as I have only had it a few days, but it seems like it will last.Give it a run. You'll be happy. I'm thinking about buying a spare..."
4,Good product,"Simple and allows a lot of flexibility. My wife has a kindle and an IPhone, this allows here to sit at the table and have them at an angle that works for them. Width wide is can be a bit narrow so with something wider like the kindle it can tip if the table gets a good bump, but honestly it takes a good bump that would also knock over the salt shaker."
5,Does exactly what it is supposed to!,I am happy I purchased this. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. If you are looking for state of the art equipment this is not it! Please keep in mind that this is a few pieces of plastic constructed to hold up your iPad or tablet and it works great. I would definitely recommend it. It also works if you have a thick rubber gumdrop case on your iPad.
5,Can't beat this solid product at a solid price!,"I Recently acquired a Kindle Fire (which is wonderful but thats a different review) and needed a stand for viewing movies and freeing up my hands. I searched all over and found walmart was asking far too much for stands and they didn't suite my taste. I am so glad I found this amazing stand! So far the stand is solid, very good looking, (bond gadget?) and allows a multitude of viewing angles. It is very sturdy despite what it may look like, has a nice grip, and folds up for on the go. Good product."
5,Hello,Bought it for my aunt and she absolutely loves it! Very convenient and helpful. She uses it every day. Thanks!
5,Perfect Little Stand,"I was looking for a simple stand for my HP TouchPad. This one fits the bill great. The stand is made of sturdy plastic and all contact points (those where the tablet touches the stand, and where the stand touches the table) are rubberized to protect and prove a non-slip stand.This product is designed for use WITHOUT a case. While it might work with one, I think that most cases have their own built-in stand. However, I wanted to mention it anyway. The reason for this is because the notches where the tablet sits are sized for just the tablet.The stand is very flexible as far as configuring the back for just about any angle.My only concern is that over time with opening/closing/adjusting the stand so much that it will start to loosen as the plastic wears down from friction. The top joints could be tightened with a Philips screwdriver if necessary, however the bottom two cannot (thought they probably wouldn't be).This is a great little stand."
5,Wow!!! Functionality is great!,"I just received this little stand for Christmas from my brother, who was so impressed by it, he plans to get himself one for his iPad, now. I asked for this to support my gTablet, and it does so perfectly in horizonal position, which is the way I display my tablet most often. I haven't used it much in the vertical setting, but it seems stable enough so long as you aren't hitting the top of the tablet for typing or using any sort of force...after all, it is a touch screen!The settings for the stand are preset and click...as a general rule, I tend to leave it in one set position, so I haven't had any degradation of the notches for each of the clicking adjustments, but I can see where, with time, these notches may wear with time. For now, it is a wonderful item and I am very glad my brother had the insight to order it for me."
3,Good for its price,"Although it's not pretty, it does its job. It's firm and doesn't sway for normal uses, and not much even for gaming. But if you put your iPad on it for prolonged time, the rubbers start to stick to your iPad and be partly detached from the stand."
5,Holds the Ipad 3 Well!,"Does a really impressive job as an Ipad 3 stand.What's not to like?The Rock Bottom Price,the Build Quality?I love this!Best stand that I could buy!More importantly kudos to amazon.Package arrived late,4 days although I am a prime customer and they refunded the full amount!Impressed!"
5,shopper 1,great little item to cary around when you don't want bulk. very good idea for sitting up in bed or in a chair and reading.
4,Works very well and also works for iPhone 5!,"This stand is great if you're not interacting with your iPad too much while using it. The top part that holds top of the iPad doesn't seem to be firm enough to hold up to much pressure.As a bonus, I folded it down and found that it held up my iPhone 5 as well!"
5,LOVE IT!!,"For $[...] and free shipping, how could you go wrong? We use this iPad stand daily. I originally got this with the idea of using it on a trip... plane or train usage on fold down table or in the room. But we use it to stand the iPad up when it's plugged in and to view when in kitchen or living room. We use the DirecTV guide on our iPad to change channels so this lil stand is nice to place your iPad on the coffee table. When I first got this I was bummed until I realized the bottom legs did open up further. At first, it seems like it doesn't which would make it unstable and flimbsy of a stand. Nope, it opens up as wide as the picture shows it. It's not perfect, but it's close to it. I love how you can adjust every aspect of the stand to fit whatever angle or shape you want. It is very cushioned with padding behind it and on the legs so your iPad is scratch safe."
4,functional,"This is plastic, nothing fancy but it does what it supposed to do. Works with my iPad 4th generation well with the cover on. It is sturdy, holds the iPad's weight well, foldable for easy transport."
5,Great Stand,What can I say? This is a great ipad stand that folds up well for travel. It allows a range of angles which makes it perfect for using this to read a book or watch a film on the ipad and minimize glare for wherever you are.
5,crazy digital,"great response received my order in no time at all fast,fast,fast products where great worked like a charm i will buy again from crazy digital very happy with there product and response time."
5,mememe,This is a very convenient little gadget. Folds up nicely and works great-it doesn't slide all over the place and you can turn your dievice upright or horizontal-super excited about it!!
4,Easy to use and very portable.,Used this fold up stand for my Epic 4G and Galaxy Tab. Both fit great. I bet you can use it for other tablets just as easily. Has a great compact feel to it. Loved the felt grips on the bottom and on the stand to prevent sliding and slipping. If the price was around < $15.99 this would be a great product and price.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I've been looking for the ideal stand since I bought the iPad. I've tried several designs, but this one does everything I need: holds the iPad firmly, adjusts to many positions, folds up for easy portability--all for a very reasonable price. Portability was especially important, as I take my iPad and keyboard everywhere, and I need an easy way to prop the iPad when typing. There is a non-stick flexible surface on the bottom of the stand supports that keeps the stand from sliding on airplane tray tables or uneven tables. All three items--iPad, keyboard, and stand--fit into my notebook case. Very handy item--I highly recommend it!"
3,Too Bulky,This product works perfectly and is a steady reliable stand. However it is too bulky.If i could go back and choose a slimer product I would.
5,Perfect for my iPad 2!,"I wanted a stand for my new iPad 2 but didn't want to overpay. This one is perfect. It's small, sturdy, and feels like it's made for my iPad. Works in portrait or landscape position. You can easily adjust the tilt angle until satisfied. Great for the breakfast table."
4,It is pretty good,"The stand work pretty good. I use it for my Motorola Xoom, the only thing is not that easy to access to the ports."
5,"perfect stand for Acer Iconia 10""","I wasn't sure whether this stand would work for my Acer since the reviews seem to imply that it did not work well with other tablets. It is PERFECT!! I can now read without having to hold my tablet. It will tilt to most any angle for easy reading and can go vertical or horizontal. I ca also plug it in while on the stand. It also folds easily to take anywhere. I could not find it in stores, but it was a great price at Amazon. Buy it here - you won't regret it!"
5,Great little stand..,"I use it for my Acer Iconia Tab 500. It's extremely sturdy and adjustable for use in both landscape and portrait modes. It folds up small enough to fit in your pocket and, although I don't have a case for my tablet, it looks like it would hold it even in a case."
5,As Advertiesed,"This is by far one of the best products i've ordered, I especially like the fact that it's universal but not only that.. it supports my Asus Eee Pad and i have access to the charging port which is awesome.. great product and great price. more durable than other's i've seen.."
5,Does what it is supposed too,I bought 3 - so far I gave one away and I am using one for myself. I the person that received the other likes theirs. No complains here - using iPad 2 and a non branded tablet.
5,iPad stand,"This is a near perfect product. Light, small, and easy to use. It is everything I was looking for. Holds both my Kindle and iPad."
5,This thing is awesome,"I admit, I was a bit skeptical when I first saw this stand. It looked flimsy in the pics but, it did receive great reviews so I decided to give it a try. Am I glad I did. The stand is much sturdier than I thought it would be. It holds my Motorola Xoom nicely and I love the fact that it is adjustable. No matter which way you have your tablet in the stand (horizontal or vertical), you will be able to adjust it to your favorite viewing angle. It folds up to a compact shape/size and is super easy to take along with you. I use mine on the kitchen counter all of the time. Works well. For the price, you can not beat this item. I like this way better than the $70 one my buddy scored for her Ipad. Do yourself a favor and buy this. You won't regret it."
5,Great stand! Works as advertised and feels solidly built.,"While not as elegant looking as some other products, this stand allows for a lot of different angles in both portrait and landscape orientation. It feel sturdy and locks securely into place for stowing and travel."
3,Can be useful,Pros:- Portable- Sturdy plastic- Good price- Adjustable to several viewing anglesCons:- Can't charge an iPad while sitting in landscape orientation because of the low height.
4,A great little stand!,"This is without a doubt the best value stand on Amazon as of the time or writing. I purchased it primarily as a stand for the Kindle Fire. However it also works excellently with my 6"" no brand player, and will even hold my phone upright on my desk.It can be a little stiff when it first arrives, but it soon loosens up with some gentle pressure."
3,Works well,"This stand works well with Ipad 1, 2 really well. Our ipad has an otter box on it and it is one of a few stands that will allow for the thickness of the cover and still work"
5,Great iPad Stand,Really like the product. Folds up nicely for travel. Very adjustable. Takes up small space and I use it with a wireless keyboard.
3,Decent,"Stand was great initially, but after a few weeks of use the notches started wearing out and the vertical support would start slipping. Also, the grip pad started to peel after a month or so. Sometimes when I want to quickly pick up my iPad, it'll stick to the device which is a bit annoying. Overall, I'd say go with something a bit more sturdy and durable."
2,Wears out quickly,"I loved this product! I bought the case from the ipad store, but It doesn't really work. It's barely able to stand up when long side up. When place wide side up, it flops. At first, I loved this stand.After a few month's use, I have changed my mind about this product. While the two leg pieces still work just fine, the back piece does not. The screws that hold it have loosened, and, because of the plastic it is made from, it cannot be tightened enough to hold. The weight of the iPad causes it to flop over backwards. Another flaw is the height of the legs. They do not hold the iPad high enough to let the charging connector clear of the table when the iPad is I. The stand.I no longer recommend this product."
4,Good stand.,"I wanted a good stand for my new Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, and for the price, this stand is perfect, though the legs sometimes are at an odd angle depending on the height set."
5,nice portable,"Good quality item , great materials, portable, low price. It is easy to carry around, different ways to use your tablet, phone. Universal fit for an unlimited numbers of tablets , phones, ereaders"
5,Best stand ever,"Best little stand ever. I've had this for about 4 months now and have traveled with it frequently during that time. People on the plane are envious of it. I use it for my tablet and kindle and phone. It folds up nicely and fits nicely in the front pocket of the Amazon bagAmazonBasics Netbook Bag with Handle, Fits 7- to 10-Inch Netbooks, iPad, HP Touchpad (Black)"
5,Works good for Kindle Fire,"Very happy with this stand for my Kindle fire. It has a lot of adjustments and compacts nicely for travel. Looks like it would work good with a bunch of different ""tablets"", would recommend."
5,"Great, simple stand","Bought this stand for the Motorola Xoom. Due to the power cord sticking out of the bottom of the Xoom (landscape mode), I simply rotate the screen so the power cord sticks out the top. The stand works just as you would expect and holds the tablet at any angle you require. Simple, pratical, and serves its purpose."
5,Lovely Solution,"Hi All,I bought this item to use it on my Windows tablet, it is really great stand never seen such in the market.I do highly recommend this lovely solution which is really great.I love to use this item all the time.with all the best."
4,"Great stand, great price","I haven't settled on a cover for my iPad yet, although when I do it will probably have a stand built-in. In the meantime, I needed a stand and this one does the job. It folds down pretty compact so that I can put it in my purse if needed. It has a lot of options for adjusting the angle of the iPad. The rubber on the bottom and where you set the iPad keeps the stand and the iPad from moving around (if you accidentally bump into it or are touching the screen)."
5,Great stand for iPad2,"This little stand is perfect for holding the iPad2 at pretty much any angle you want, portrait or landscape view. I think the only angle that the iPad2 cover is better at is the very low typing angle. But for viewing and casual tapping and swiping, this stand is MUCH sturdier and flexible. Very portable as well. So glad I found this!"
5,Very happy,I'm very happy with my purchase. I use it for my Kindle DX and Galaxy Tab. It can be adjusted at different angle. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a low cost stand.
5,Quite possibly perfect,"A simple and elegant iPad stand.I have the Apple magnetic iPad cover along with a snap-on shell for the back. The Apple cover can elevate the top end of my iPad about two and a half inches, which comes in handy in a lot of circumstances, but it really doesn't help for those times when I want to really stand my iPad up. Whether I'm reading the news with breakfast, using my iPad as a portable TV, or reading a recipe in the kitchen - I need something that will hold my iPad at a steeper angle when I can't or don't want to hold it.I knew this was exactly what I wanted when I saw it. Amazingly small, functional, and maybe even perfect - I can't complain."
2,"Clever design, but slips up","Am I the only person who's had the problem of the iPad slipping off the stand? The so-called non-slip stand in fact every so often sends your iPad slipping and sliding, even onto the floor. So in spite of the clever design in other respects, I find that I'm wary of using the stand. Some non-slip material on the base would probably do the trick, but hey, isn't that what I bought the stand for in the first place? A good idea badly executed."
4,Works well,"Feels a bit flimsy but once you prise it open and have your iPad mounted on the stand it is really steady. Probably wouldn't try typing on the screen with it on the stand - wobbles around a little bit - so a Bluetooth keyboard is recommended for typing, but infrequent tapping would be ok. iPad sits nicely in both portrait and landscape orientation and doesn't slide around, held by rubber pads on the two legs and a large pad on the vertical strut behind."
5,Best I have found,"This thing, simply put, does what it says it does. Everyone I show it to wants one. I've only had it a few weeks but I use it several hors a day and it shows no sign of wear. I really, really like it.Toally flexible. Lightweight yet sturdy. And very inexpensive. My favorite iPad accesory."
4,"Cheap, inexpensive and works.","I am using this stand for the Viewsonic G-Tablet. Because of the different size than the iPad, this stand does not quite adjust perfectly which is why I give it 4/5 stars. Currently the vertical support only makes contact with the tablet at the very tip of the stand. I was hoping that I could adjust the stand a little more to have the entire tablet supported with the vertical padded support. If the manufacturer gave a couple more ""clicks"" on the setting of the vertical support angle, it would be perfect, but as it sits now, it's not quite there."
5,This is a great product,"I just received this stand for my new iPad. It's much better then I expected. It is totally adjustable in ANY position you want. It is is very well made, especially for the price! I highly recommend it. I can easily leave my iPad cover while on it too. It would fit any generation iPads. I will use it while cooking so I can look at my recipes on-line, while it sits on the counter and I will use it to talk to my mom on Skype, while it holds my iPad on my desk or kitchen counter. It will be great for the airplane to watch movies or to read books. It's supper small and very efficient and versatile!"
4,Great design... great for portrait mode.,"My case for my galaxy Note 10.1 only does landscape mode. This simple (and cheap) device lets me do portrait mode without removing the case from my tablet. Folds up into almost nothing. Seems rugged, but it is plastic so I am sure it will break eventually. Anything less than a level surface will cause it to be unstable. The extreme range of adjustment means I can use it for my tablet and my phone."
3,review,"I had difficulty trying to open it and put the ipad on it. but once I figured it out then it worked fine..thanks,v moore"
2,Not Compatible with Toshiba Thrive,"I purchased with stand to use with my 16GB Toshiba Thrive TabletToshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016From the description and reviews I thought it was a sure bet. The description clearly says Toshiba and they only have one tablet. This product description should be changed to reflect the fact it is not compatible with the Toshiba Thrive product line. Well only thing is that the pre fabricated slots for width of tablet is notcompatible with Toshiba Thrive. The Thrive is too thick to sit in the grooves on the stand and continually falls out and remains very unstable.Not too upset because stand was cheap, but I really have no use for it. Guess I will give it to one of my friends who has an IPAD.Still happy I bought the Thrive b/c really enjoy the access of full size USB and SD Card slots but starting to realize how much thicker it is than all the other tablets."
3,Works well. Has a very strong odor.,"I would give this stand 4 or 5 stars but it absolutely stinks. The pads are made of the same stuff as very smelly mouse pads - might be neoprene. In any case, it's very strong and even after 2 weeks sitting out in the hot garage to off-gas it still has such a strong odor I don't want it in the house. Other than the smell, it looks good, is easy to use - all the things you want in a small, portable stand."
4,"Great inexpensive,stand for Xoom",I just received this stand today. For 14 bucks I got what I paid for. It holds my Xoom perfectly and I also have the gel case on. Its a real bargain if u want quick portable stand for Xoom .
5,Very good gadget,"If you don't want to use a cover or other book like option this little gadget is the one for you, it lets you use your tablet on portrait or landscape mode"
4,Excellent and stable tablet stand!,"This is a very good stand for tablets and is surprisingly stable. The only thing I would change is the height off the table. If you have a speaker cable plugged in, it can't sit at the bottom, you have to rotate the view."
1,garbage,Made of cheap plastic not the way the description reads in details of product used for one day and broke a waste of10 dollars
1,"Arkon Portable Fold-up Stand Apple Ipad, Galaxy, Tb, Kindle","don't use can't hold weight of Ipad. Would be great for mini ipad. My ipad fell over with it o my desk and cracked the glass, so it had to go i for repair."
2,fold up stand,Another of those that sounds like a ( it is never where I need it)...good idea... but really is NOT!
5,Great Gadget!,A must have with the ipad and it's reasonable and sturdy! Especially great for when you want to SKYPE ... so the ipad isn't jumping and has adjustable angles!Great Item!
4,Good stand - Fit very well for Notion ink Adam,I like this stand. It is very small but serves the purpose. It fit my Notion ink adam very well. My only problem if any is with the adjustment of the stand. it is not as smooth as i would like.
4,Wonderful!,"This stand is a just little large for my iPod Touch, and very slightly on the small side for my iPad, when it is in my Kraken case.Also, it is hard to have the charging cable plugged in if I want my device to be in portrait mode.Otherwise, this is extremely nice:1, very solidly built-I expected something much flimsier, like most products these days;2. soft, non-skid material on the underside which won't harm the finish on your coffee table;3. very easy to use, no manual needed!;4. extremely adjustable to various sizes of devices;5. small enough and light enough to easily toss in your briefcase or overnight bag when traveling.I like to rest my iPod or iPad on this, and leave it open to whatever chat app I am using, and I can monitor chat for replies out of the corner of my eye. No more do I need to keep bending my head over my device like I did when it was laying flat on my desk. :)I am very impressed with this, and heartily recommend it to anyone considering it!"
5,So nice I bought it twice!,"Simple and economical stand works great with our KINDLE FIRES. Folds up and makes it very convenient to travel with. I feel it is very durable for the price. Not a ""cheap-o"" feel. Safe and stable with no worries of causing harm to the tablet. Highly recommend."
4,The lasting attraction of Kat'a,"This re-release of what is arguably Janacek's finest opera is essential listening for anyone with even a passing interest in good music. From a composer described by some as the greatest opera composer of the twentieth century, and conducted by the able baton of the great Mackerras, the extraordinary dynamism of this performance cannot be ignored. Janacek is, for me, a master of orchestration in opera, never relaxing into even mildly predictable music. Instead he drags the audience through the tragedy of Kat'a's adultery by the earlobe. From the atypically (for Janacek) well-crafted overture to the tumultuous final bars, the spiralling emotions experienced by the sensitive and at times half-crazed Katerina are forced into the listener's belly via timpani and exquisite vocal lines. High points are Katerina's moving and shattering monologue in Act 1 Sc 2, her climactic love scene with Boris in Act2 Sc2 and her final breakdown prior to her suicide in Act3 Sc2."
1,Not what I expected,"I wanted to hear the soulful Bill Wolfer, who worked with Stevie Wonder, Jon Gibson not easy listening"
4,Civil War on Sunday,In this book Jack and Annie get whisked back to the Civil Warand go to a hospital base to help the nurses.They get a list of whatto do to help make the sick feel better. When Jack and Annie meet Clara Barton they decide to help her rescue more of the wounded from the treacherous war.One of the people they help is a young drummer boy named John. Little do they know that young boy is one of their relatives.
5,Civil War on Sunday was a FABULOUSE read!,"I bet a lot of people have heard of the Magic Tree House series. Well I really like book #21 Civil War on Sunday. It is about Jack and Annie go back to the Civil War. They help some people and meet some people along the way of helping people.My favorite part was when Annie and Jack were in the tent with the wounded drummer boy John. What they did for him was very nice. They were nice to cheer him up.I would recommend this book for K-4. You might need to read it out loud to a kindergartner, first graders could get through it with some help, it is just right for second graders, but for third and fourth grade it might not be much of a challenge.This book has 21 others in its series. The next book will come out in May of 2001. These great series of books can also help teach many different things. This book was written by Mary Pope Osborne."
5,civil war on sunday,My son started the series and couldn't put the books down he was reading 3 books a day. We have the complete collection at home and he is always looking for her to release a new book. I plan on giving himm the recearch guides she and her husband have done together. We look forward to any new releases.
1,arrghhh,"I bought this book thinking it would be a GUIDE for blues rock lead playing, like the author suggest. Well the author forgot that GUIDE means enlighting and take someone to a path. But that's not the case.The book starts with the worse explanation for pentatonics fingerings ever. Shallow and short, leaving you with that ?! face.When reviewers say its a book for advanced players, its because there is no explanation or at least a clear explanation for the licks and phrases shown. Because the licks aren't for advanced players, I garantee. They're attainable for the mid player, if there is enough patience to play such unpleasent phrases.If your dollar is hard earned like mine, stay away, buy something else. This is just another book to get dust in the closet.Don't be fooled by the Musicians Institute reputation like I was."
3,Somewhat mechanical performance for my taste,"While Ashkenazy is undoubtedly very strong technically, he makes a mistake in my view trying to play the piano and conduct at the same time. The Beethoven piano concerti are challenging enough that when the soloist must devote his attention to the piano part, he literally has no time to conduct the orchestra, which must then go basically on autopilot until the soloist can surface again. Of necessity, then, this recording is often much more mechanical and rigid than I think Beethoven, a Romantic, would have preferred. My preference is to hear renditions of these works by Murray Perahia, who performs the Emperor concerto in particular with the majestic abandon I think Beethoven must have wanted."
4,Beethoven: Piano Concerto No.3; Choral Fantasy,"Dear Sir or Madam,As for Choral Fantasy, I'm more impressed with Peter Serkin's performance."
5,good shop,"Goes is damaged or if, I was worried about how bad the condition of the disk, I received the order of the state. Thank you."
5,A must buy !!,"This is it people,Walter Aziz proved again that Assyrians can compete with the world when it comes to music.Before this album I dont know if Assyrians did that but AWAY is the real proof of going to that direction.I recomand this album to all Middle Eastern & no Middle Eastern music lovers."
5,"Walter Aziz ""AWAY"" is the ultimate Assyrian/Middle EasternCD",This Is it people!! If you dont have this CD and you are a middle eastern music lover then you are missing out.AWAY is beyond what Assyrian artists can do.ITS AMAZING!!!!!
3,Charming (though a bit reverential) look at these groundbreaking and door opening twins.,Charming (though a bit reverential) look at these groundbreaking and door opening twins. The filmmaker wisely cuts away from the subdued and ordinary framing concert at every opportunity using the music as a backdrop for the sister's fascinating history. I would love to see the Topp Twins tour with a reunited Romanovsky and Phillips.
1,Author,"do not get to the point. He actually provides no explanation on how homeopathy might work. And it is not a big surprise - he is not a specialist in CAM, and he did not conducted thoroughly investigation.To say that homeopathy is placebo is equal to say nothing, because up to date no theory exists which explains all phenomena observed during placebo investigations.One who really want to understand how homeopathy might work should read articles and monographs by Harald Walach -professor for Research Methodology in Complementary Medicine at Europa Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt/Oder.I reccomend to read his two articles :1) ""The Efficacy Paradox in Randomized Controlled Trialsof CAM and Elsewhere: Beware of the Placebo Trap.""2) ""Magic of Signs: A Nonlocal Interpretation of Homeopathy""Both these articles are freely available on the web.Homeopathy is a big scientific mystery, but due to dogmatism and pressure from Big Pharma and allopaths science mostly ignores homeopathy."
1,Worthless,"Here are reasons not to buy this WORTHLESS ""camera"":1. Flash worked 7% of the time2. Expect button jams 41% of the time which means expect wasting two or three pictures per jam.3. Strap was pre-frayed stringy mess upon arrival4. Four rolls of 24 exposures = 17 pictures... thats an 18% success rate!?[...]After spending two weeks on vacation with this camera we would have to give it an absolute zero. Paper cuts are more fun than this waste of time and money. I would not recommend this ""camera"" [...]"
4,It was a very smooth reading book.,I must say that I enjoyed this book very much and so havemost of the people I have spoke with. It is a good poetic book with a lot of great insights into the heart and soul of Saint Francis. Bodo has a wonderful way of expressing the poetic heart of Francis through his own poetry. A must read for anyone interested in Saint Francis of Assisi.
4,Great little book,"This is a great little book. I first read it in 1972. It had just been published. I was a freshman at St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, and Fr. Murray was my English teacher. So it has special significance for me.I've kept my copy and read it many times over the years. I've carried it with me in visiting Assisi twice.In my view, Fr. Murray does a great job of expressing the simplicity of Francis' philosophy, the power of his vision and the beauty of his life.This book is a poem and a prayer. Like all great poetry, it will inspire you. And like all prayer, it will connect you and give you peace."
5,Beyond the Sparrow,"Fr. Bodo has captured the essential mystical spiritualism of St. Francis. Through deep anecdotal description of Francis' profound faith, the reader simultaneously is introduced to the events of Francis' mortal life as embedded in his spiritual world view. This is a brilliant, insightful, moving introduction to the life, work, and faith of a saint."
5,Ashkenazy...probably the best pianist on the planet,"There is nobody else, who recorded all 4 Rachmaninovs piano concertos. The 3rd is probably the most difficoult concerto in world repertoar...and Ashkenazy plays it brillantly!And quality of record is very very good...because it was recorded in concert hall of Amsterdam, and not in a small studio without acustic.Do you want the best record of Rachmaninovs piano concertos?Buy THAT!!!!"
4,Nice sound for the price,"A previous reviewer had problems with this unit, however it seems to be a very good sounding reciever. Haven't had any quality problems at least up to this time. There are also lower end two channel units by KLH and Sherwood and the Sherwood does not have the bass response that the Teac 370 does. (Not sure about the KLH model)."
1,Stopped functioning after four months,"This receiver is of poor quality. After about four months it stopped functioning properly. Anytime a loud noise goes through it (i.e. a gunshot during a dvd movie) the volume cuts out for several seconds. Also if you adjust the volume knob the volume cuts out and you get white noise until you jiggle the knob and turn it back and forth several times and even then you don't generally end up with the volume level you were aiming for. However, if you insist on buying it anyway it has almost everything you could ask for in a stereo receiver assuming you get one that functions properly. It even has phono jacks for those of us who still play records. However, it does not come with a remote control. Also the instructions on setting up the AM antenna are unclear."
3,One really annoying feature,"Every time I turn it on, it starts on AM radio, rather than on whatever was used last. Otherwise, it seems fine, though I haven't really used it enough to do a full review."
1,The ionic feature cannot be used on cats!!!,"Without batteries, this is just a regular hair brush. But with batteries, you can turn on the ""ionic feature"" of the brush. However, when turned on, the brush emits a very high-pitched buzzing sound. Even though I could barely hear it, both of my cats immediately got very scared, ran out of the room, hid, and wouldn't come back until the buzzing offender was removed from the area. The sound this brush emits is extremely irritating to cats (don't know about dogs, but my guess is, dogs as well), so I wouldn't bother with this product!!"
5,Great Mozart Miniatures,"This is a fine recording of several piano compositions which are small in scale, but contain marvelous music. I would note especially the Adagio in B-minor (K540) and the Rondo in A-minor (K511)---both of which, in spite of their comparative brevity, are masterpieces."
1,Does not open far enough to grip food!,"I bought these tongs because they were a pretty simple design i.e. easier to clean. However, the ""open"" state of the tongs is not very open, so it's hard to grip larger items without having to pry it open with your fingers first - so what's the point? I now have tongs which are spring-loaded and they work much better, and keeping them clean isn't really a problem. If you decide to buy these tongs, I'd recommend buying them at a store where you can see how far your particular pair opens and get a feel for how they grip."
5,Feelgood classic- a surefire US hit if it gets marketed well,"Toploader actually come from the same town as me, Eastbourne on the South Coast of England. This song has made the UK top 20 twice, first in original form and then as a remix by Stargate. This is the original one, which is closest to the vibe of King Harvest's original (which I also like having now heard it). The style ogf this, being uplifting and positive, is indeed a throwback to Britpop, and makes a change from the dour Travis. Nice guitar pop, and a major international smash. Only the US remains to be cracked."
4,Nostalgic................,"This song's getting pretty heavy airplay around here on MTV Asia as well as Channel V, though not enough on any counts for me. This is, without doubt my ""pick-me-up"" song for the moment. Take a listen, and you will see, or rather hear, why !"
5,Amazing!,I was at this show and it was one of the best concerts I had ever been to. It's wonderfull to be able to relive it whenever I want to just by popping this into my cd player.
4,Very happy with purchase!,"This is a great globe, it has raised land marks, detailed up to date country's , but it has a nice classic vintage look, so it can be displayed in living room or office."
2,horrible.,Bad editing! Very bad. Its choppy. In all the performances its the track singing! I would have loved to hear her live voice!! Very disappointed. Its great to see her though that's why I gave 2 stars.
2,TWO Different DVDS,"I see that there are TWO different DVDS of this...both with the same Interviews and Interludes, but with different performances. One of earlier music and one of the later years? Has anyone else noticed this as well."
3,Expected more,"There are only three appearances on this disk.I thought we might get a song from each appearance....but no!Because I love Selena I gave it 3 stars, but I really feel they cheatedSelena and me."
5,Covers ears and neck,This is exactly what I was looking for: a light weight white reflective hat that protected my ears and the back of my neck - protection not available on baseball caps or even some brimmed hats. The hat is made of thin nylon fabric. I have not washed yet so I can't comment on upkeep.
2,Not as nice as the photograph,"As sometimes happens, this cross appears to be much nicer than it is in reality when it arrives. It is quite flat and does not look as good as the photo. The chain is quite nice. Rather a disappointment."
1,not interested at all,"Just the previews I heard on amazon turned me off. Cam is whack, his rhymes are whack, and he needs a new formula. His rhymes only prove to me that he has a rhyming thesaurus, cuz he tries to jam every word that rhymes into however many bars he gets at the time. The Hood Cat In The Hat, pink fur and all.Can't believe people are actually paying their hard-earned, recession-tight dollars on this ish! His rhymes were better when he was chubby. Maybe he's just hungry. All I know is, Julez needs to take this joe back to the drawing board."
4,"""Real Rap"" Camron is a true lyricist!","Cam'ron has always produced ill music and a type of gangsta flow. Cam, Juelz, and Lil Wayne are up there together as far as great lyricism! He has definitely produced another fire album which is a must buy....."
4,Pretty nice comeback!,"I'm a pretty big fan of killa cam. In all of his albums, I'd put this 1 at #3. This jawn is pretty tight, but it's not a purple haze. Wish I hadn't brought the clean 1 by accident! lol! But still it's worth buying!"
3,Could be better,This album could've been a lot better. I'm a Cam fan but I was disappointed. This would barely qualify even as a mixtape
4,CAMRON YOUR OUT TIEC TOCC IS IN !!,IM TIRED OF THESE WACK old artist still trying to take all the spaceI find alot of great new indie major atist on amazon.com I Love Tiec Tocc 's New single Frozen Highly Recommended and The Dream and keri hilsonand ways cam no mam
2,"Not A Classic,Not A Good Come Back!","I'm a big fan of Cam but im gonna keep it real unlike others :(, i heard better from Cam past albums this album is like a mixtape, & let's be serious here these tracks can't line up as classics they to silly lol at least is way better than Jim Pray IV Reign that album is completely trash!"
2,Very Sturdy; Limited fun,"I bought this for my Elmo-obsessed 19 month old. She's thrilled with the pictures of Elmo that are on the toy, and she likes spinning the block with his picture on it; however, the thrill only lasts a few seconds. The toy is way to heavy for her to lift herself. Two of the picture blocks have upside-down pictures (probably why this toy is on sale).As she gets older, I'm sure she'll be able to lift it, and she'll have fun recognizing the numbers and letters and counting and making words. The letters are color coded so that the kids can self-check spelling words that match up with the pictures. I think this toy could have made better use of word families so that there would be more word possiblilities to be formed by spinning the letter blocks.All in all, for a child who is crazy about Elmo, it might be worth the [..] I spent on it. Otherwise, I'd say there are other toys out there that are better suited to help a child learn letters and how to spell words."
5,Worked perfect,I just needed a hoist to do a light weight job and this hoist worked perfectly. I haven't used it for anything heavy yet but I am sure it will do just fine. My only wish would be for if to have a longer cord on the control handle.
4,rare and strange,I've had the soundtrack on CD for this movie since it first came out. (Miles Davis trumpet) You can't explain this movie to anyone. They have to watch it but you can't rent it anywhere. You have to buy it. Big name cast and great music for such a convoluted story. I'm glad I have my copy before it's gone forever.
3,"Great game, poorly made!","I have HAD to buy at least 4 of these games. After using it for a while, about 2-3 weeks, it breaks! The red controller button breaks and will not rotate to make the game inoperable! It is a waste of money! It is a REAL pain to send in for a replacement! I love this game for the different games it offers, but, it does not last! I am very disappointed!"
2,Love Tetris but...,I love this game but the unit is poorly constructed. I have had four of these units .They are getting harder to find and they are becomming more expensive. They only last a few months before the controller begins to wear out and becomes irratic. The problem seems to be in the electrical connections.
1,worst,this i believe was the first item that i purchased at amazon. And i believe that it was the worst i've ever purchased.I believe that i bought 2.And none of them last a month or two.worst and worst.
1,Not For Me,"This player lasted barely 6 months before it died. And throughout its short life, it was very sickly. The sound was fine -- good, in fact -- but the software just did not work. Most of the time, the button pushed did not provide the requested function. Instead, the player would do something completely different -- play instead of mute, turn off instead of on, delete instead of save, etc. The database never quite knew what items were or were not on the player; an item would be there one day and gone the next, perhaps to return a few days later. In the end, nothing could be added or even deleted. All it would do was play whatever it thought was there on that particular day. Not the sort of performance I wanted."
3,not very good,"I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE EASY TO MAKE PLAYLIST ON IT, WHEN YOU HOOK IT TO YOUR COMPUTER IT, SHOULD SHOW LEVEL OF BATTERY AT THE SAME TIME NO MATTERWHAT.........."
3,A fun little supernatural soap,"I'll keep this review very simple. Hellfire is not John Saul's best, and it's not his worst. It's good, enjoyable, easy to read, and the plot is never boring. The main storyline is given a nice wrap up, and there is enough nastiness to keep horror fans happy. It also helps that the characters are interesting, and I wanted to follow them.Pick it up. It's barely over three hundred pages, and it flies by. I read it in one night, and when the book was over, I felt satisfied with what I'd read. Perfect for when you are stuck inside, and daytime TV just isn't cutting it."
4,Good book,I borrowed this from my county library for Kindle. I found it intertaining and well-written overall. I liked the characters. It gets my recommendation.
4,Read this book if you dare!,This was a good book The characters all resemble that of a small town and the haunted mill was a good location for the storys plot. Unspeakable things happened to children working at that milll long ago. The doors have been shut for years when the last surviving heir of the Sturgess family decides to turn in into a mall.His family will end up paying the price for the reconstructing of the old abandaned mill. The ending was quite satisfying but as readers of John Saul no his endings usually leave you hanging in mid air.
1,The fire should have stayed in Hell,"This has to be the worst John Saul book I've read recently (and I've read 6 in the past 2 months!). It's more like a V.C. Andrews book than anything that's supposed to be horror. Evil, rich, spoiled girl makes life a living Hell for poor, sweet, step-sister? Please! How cliche can you get?"
5,Excelente,"Selenium es una marca de JBL de Brasil que esta ganado posicones en el mercado, son relativamente economicos y la relación precio valor es buena, el sonido que despachan es de calidad, a pesar de que la conformación del cono es algo simple."
5,Why there were riots in France's banlieus,"This is a great book about the way architecture affects the lives of people who live in it. If you want an explanation for the recent two weeks of riots in France's banlieus, you will find part of the explanation here. This is MUST reading for anyone interested in urban planning, or in modern urban society. I give it the highest possible recommendation."
5,Amazing sounds,This is perfect for experienced players or beginners learning to play. I used it at church as a temporary fix and it was fine. I haven't used it with the computer - I'm not interested in composing - but it looks like it would be a great tool.
5,Best buy in a long time,"This unit is all that is advertised and more. The hundreds of voices and available synthos make it a ""close to pro"" instrument. The onboard speakers are plenty loud for inside and the key touch is awesome. I am going to buy another one for Christmas."
5,faye,Excellent features - probably too many for me. Still exploring all the possibilities. Nice Sound.
2,Disappointed with stand,"The Piano was good, but be WARNED.THE STAND THAT COMES WITH THE PIANO DOES NOT FIT THE PIANO.I discovered this when trying to put it together."
2,So So,"If you want to learn to play piano, go to a better one or a real one, this one is really a toy."
5,Cute and funny for preschoolers,"This book is always popular with the young children I teach. First of all, for three- and four-year-olds, almost nothing's funnier than a sneeze - they love to join in at the end and make the loudest (and longest) sneeze you ever heard. And the illustrations are adorable. Also, it makes a great lead-in to talking about hygiene - washing your hands so you won't get a cold - and sneezing and coughing into your elbow. These are things young children need lots of reminding about!"
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE - BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!,"This shopping experience was a nightmare. I ordered the necklace as a Christmas present. It arrived on 12/22, but was a different necklace than pictured. I immediately called and they said they'd ship the correct necklace via Next Day Air. The 2nd necklace arrived and was the same WRONG necklace. At this point, my Christmas present was ruined.I requested that they issue a Call Tag or send a shipping label for me to return the products. It took over 3 weeks and at least 8 phone calls to get the necklaces returned and a credit issued. Every time I called, I got a different excuse. I finally had to get their UPS account # and do it myself. On 3 occasions, I was assured that someone would return my call, and they NEVER did. I spent so much time on this - it was ridiculous.This was horrible from start to finish. I will never again order from this company."
5,gateway to classical music,"As a listener more frequently of pop music by artists like the Beatles and Beach Boys, I was surprised to find how much I was moved by this recording. The music is vigorous, economical, and witty; the performance passionate; and the recording superb. The introductory three note tag to the first piece grabs you, and the rest holds you. I have this album around for the times when I get too tired of the mechanical simplicity of pop music."
3,A little too late,"Dusalina Giannini is best known nowadays for her 1920s recording of Aida with Pertile and the La Scala forces. These broadcasts from SanFransisco find the bloom off the voice. Some top notes are not secure, nor very attractive. The best selection is the Cavalleria Rusticana excerpts where the mezzo key finds her more comfortable. What is evident from this CD is that we no longer have anyone singing in the Grand Italian style. While there are some beautiful voices out there one has to return to such a singer as Giannini to hear what Grand Opera was about. Imperfect yes, but much more exciting than our scrubbed clean approach of today. For that reason, this is a flawed but enjoyable Cd."
3,Pre Nancy Drew Book,"Overall I think that this book can be closest compared to an intermediary between the Bobbsey Twins and Nancy Drew. The book has a lot of action but seems to lack the developed plot of a typical Nancy Drew (female detective) book. The thing that I liked about this book was that it did not claim that Heather Reed, the blonde girl detective, was spectacular.Overall the book also was a little hard to follow and had to spell out who was the ""bad person"" and motives in the last chapter because there were too many different possible paths along the way.An average girl detective book that would be perfect for a third or fourth grade reader. While I did read through this entire book I cannot picture myself reading another in the series because it lacked a certain fluidity that I look for in a good mystery book."
1,Rip-off poor quality,"I expected these batteries to be a little less quality than ""name-brand"", but they were extremely poor! I used them in a camera and a flash light. The perfomance was pathetic! Life was only %20 of other brands. Do not purchase from this cheap, false claim company. ""super heavy duty"" - what a lie. very unhappy."
1,Under powered,"We tested these batteries upon arrival for use in wireless com. They tested under power right out of the box, and didn't even last two hours. These are little more than battery cases in bulk."
2,Dont work in camera,"Figured that with 50 batteries even if they didn't last quite as long it would be OK. Figured wrong. New set of batteries last 3 to 6 pictures then get battery exhausted message. Too little life to shut the camera down. Have to remove batteries and start over. Same results with several tries, gave up and bought some rechargablesDave B."
1,What a waste,"I bought a pack of these because I needed 40 batteries to power a bunch of battery operated LED lights for one night...not even one night, about five hours. Thankfully I tested them prior to the night I needed them because they barely lasted an hour. I decided to use them in my TV remotes and a wireless mouse, but I find myself throwing them out in a matter of weeks.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on real batteries. I wasted $11 trying to be cheap and then wound up buying real batteries on top of it."
1,Disappointingly fast discharge,"Have to concur with all the one star ratings here. I bought these batteries for my electric timer candles that I use to lit around my house windows. The candles usually lit up for about 5 hours per evening. After less than a week, all candles went dim during the hours when they were supposed to be lit. Turns out, all the batteries went below the needed charge power. Thats after about 5 of 5 hour usages running up tiny candle light. I should have sent this back indeed. :( Amazon should take negative credit for allowing to advertise this product as ""Super Heavy-Duty""."
1,Batteries,"Very unhappy with these batteries. They do not hold a charge for very long, they last approximately 2 days in my cordless computer mouse."
1,SPEND $$ ON A BETTER BATTERY,"I bought these batteries to use only for my electric toothbrush. It didn't take long for the batteries to die...even though I use my toothbrush twice a day for approximately 3-4 minutes each use. I shouldn't have to change my toothbrush batteries one a week. With these universaly batteries, that's exactly what I must do. Next time, I'll just spend the money on a more expensive, but longer-lasting battery!New- UPG D5322/D5922 SUPER HEAVY-DUTY BATTERY VALUE BOX (AA; 50 PK)"
3,An unpleasant surprise...my fault,"This experience will teach me to shop carefully! I did not read the fine print, and reacted to the attractive price. (I use a LOT of batteries.) When I got the package, I noticed that it nowhere said ""alkaline"" batteries.Years ago, in an effort extend the sales life of ""carbon-zinc"" batteries, the various companies re-labeled them as ""heavy duty"" or ""special heavy duty"" but alkaline batteries have pushed the carbon-zinc batteries out of existence. I thought.But, no, wait! I would bet that these are CARBON-ZINC batteries! I read the reviews, and I see that they certainly perform like carbon-zincs."
1,Heavy-Duty my butt!,I put a set in my camera - - use it for a half hour - - turn camera off and set aside for a day or two - - NEXT TIME I PICK UP CAMERA LOW BATTERY LIGHT IS ON.Size of batteries seems to be a bit SMALLER than other brands.Rip-off.
1,"These batteries only last about 1-3 minutes then, they go out, no power.",Dont buy these batteriesThey are no goodThey only last 1-3 minutesBe carefulThe battery life is so short you will need an autoloader into whatever you are operating.
1,Substandard quality...,I knew the price was too good to be true. These batteries just don't last compared to the top brand names....spend a few dollars and buy a brand name....
3,Price ver value?,"The price is very reasonable, but the life is shorter than what I would expect compared to others I have used. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of these, as I get better life out of others I have used,,,In actuality,rice/val, it is a draw,,but having to change batteries in the middle of a session is frustrating."
1,Not for long lasting,Battery life is very poor. Not suitable for toys . you may use it for clocks or small electronics. consider buying the alkaline batteries.
4,Good Value,The author does a decent job of introducing basic concepts that any business should implement in order to gain the confidence of customers and earn repeat business. Some of the ideas appear to be obvious but my guess is very few trades people implement. Most of the core concepts could be summed up in a few short pages but again most trades people I know do not do what to many would be obvious.
2,Not very durable,"I received my front and rear set of Floorliners for my 4Runner yesterday. Installed them and went to dinner. In a 15 minute ride to the restaurant, my dates high heels really scratched up the passenger mat. No surface scratches, deep ones. I'm replacing them with a $20 pair of rubber mats from Sam's Club today. They may be good for snow, mud and spills, but they met their match with women's shoes!"
1,No 2-way power,"While the specs above say:2-Way power supply offers plug-in power with selected Sony or Aiwa portable recorders; battery power for use with all other recordersThis is NOT TRUE. There is no battery unit shipped with this device; you can see it in the instructions, but it isn't in the package. So, unless you are using it with a ""selected Sony or Aiwa"" device, DON'T BUY THIS. It won't work.BTW, I am a slow learner. When I bought the first one of these, I thought it was defective because it didn't have the battery pack. I returned it and got another one, which was absolutely unopened -- guess what! THERE IS NO BATTERY PACK IN THE BLISTERPACK."
3,"Wrong product description... otherwise, okay","The product description used on Amazon incorrectly states that this mic comes with a power supply. Wrong. The Sony ECM-CS10 does not come with a power supply. The Sony ECM-C115 does. And the two models share a User Guide, which may be where the confusion originated.After reading a few of the reviews where this was a concern, I did some research, and was pretty sure that I was not buying a mic with an included power supply. So I was not disappointed. But had I not done that research and relied on Amazon's description, and had I needed/wanted a power supply, I might have been a little upset.As far as quality of the recording, it's a marked improvement over my digital voice recorder's (Sony ICD-UX70) built-in mic. It's not studio-quality, certainly, but an improvement all the same."
2,Be careful... no power supply,"I purchased this mic and did not notice it did not come with a battery in the line. That is, the computer, camera, tape recorder must be able to supply power to the mic because the mic cannot power itself.I returned this mic for a full refund."
1,ECM-CS10 does not have battery power capability,"Despite being advertised otherwise on Sony's site as well as many vendors, this unit is plug-in power only ... it does not come with a battery clip to permit operation with non plug-in power devices. I purchased and had to return."
4,improved sound but still not perfect,"I use my digital voice recorder to make relaxation CDs for my patients so that they can practice the skills I teach them. This microphone definitely helped improve the quality of the sound; however, it still comes across somewhat distorted. One of my patients mentioned that it sounds a step up from the bootleg CDs you can get on the streets, which he believes was an improvement from the CD I made him before (without the microphone)- but it's still not great."
3,A Decent Clip Mic,"The Sony ECM-CS10 serves its purpose. Its shortcomings are that it is built to a price point and the resulting sound is bass anemic even for voice recording. So it could sound better even for the price. Still, it is fairly inconspicuous. You really can't complain too much at this price point. I give it a mixed-bag rating of 3 stars."
1,WARNING: This product DOES NOT INCLUDE battery box as advertised.,"Sony ECM-CS10 Tie-Clip-Style Omnidirectional Business MicrophoneAlthough the product description says that this microphone includes ""2-way power supply"" IT DOES NOT. The required battery box is not included. It is plug-in power only. After many phone calls with Sony, it appears that only the ECM-C115 microphone includes a battery box, but Sony has discontinued that model and no longer has battery boxes in stock."
4,Another valuable volume for the space enthusiast,"Apollo 14 may be best known for Alan Shepard's return to space (and perhaps his golf shot on the moon). But it was also the first serious science mission as well as the return to flight after the near-disaster of Apollo 13. As usual, the text includes the pre-mission press and internal reports, and the post-mission summaries and crew debriefings. The accompanying CD contains hundreds of photos from the mission as well as an interview with astronaut Ed Mitchell.Yet another valuable volume for the space enthusiast."
4,Good overview of networks but author a bit naive,"""Linked"" gives a good overview of what networks are and the effects they have on phenomena like business, mathematics, marketing and biology. The author does however seem to think no one knew about networks and network effects until he started researching it in 97 or 98. So if you know something about networks this will be a bit irritating. If you've read ""New rules for the new economy"" by Kevin Kelly a lot of the thoughts are going to be old news but Barbasi does take the ideas one step further and that makes the book worth a read."
2,"Repetitive, obnoxious","I am a computer engineer. I know this is a general audience pop-sci book, but it was too watered down. I would have been better off reading a short research paper on the subject.All the author seemed to write about was his jet-hopping and his good ol' boys club of researchers. I'm surprised he didn't advertise Albert TV: the webcam--see me at my desk, writing my next book...about...myself!Much of the scientific writing was repetitive--as if he were trying to fulfill a publisher's page quota. Maybe I've just been exposed to the topic before, but most of the concepts seemed to be common sense. If you remove the hub in a star network, it will go down. REALLY!?! I smell Nobel and Pulitzer!In summary, a grand display of hubris, speckeled with a few easily-digestible facts amid a sea of repetition."
5,"Applicable to Al Qaeda, SARS, and Getting a Job","Linked traces the developers and development of network theory from 1929 to 2002. Barabasi uniquely combines a sense of the theorist as a person and a personality with a summary of the theory they developed and the constraints it overturned. He also applies these theories to diverse areas from cellular biology to corporate boardrooms and Asian financial markets.It's easy to see how this book is applicable to Al Qaeda and the current SARS epidemic as well as to your own approach to work. For example, in Chapter 4: Small Worlds, Barabasi relates the Strength of Weak Ties theory of Granovetter that in finding a job ""our weak social ties are more important than our cherished strong friendships.""The most suprising thing about the book is that Barabasi takes a rather boring, paradoxically isolated area of dry intellectual inquiry and manages to convey how exciting and applicable network theory is to everyday life."
3,The author still has room to enjoy and improve his writing,"As many others say, this book is good in diffusion of ideas about the science of networks. But from my point of view, the author is not yet mature in his writing style.If you compare this book with best sellers of Gladwell or Thaler or Arieli, the book does not deserve 5 stars, but 3. I explain it.The book does a good job in explaining basically the concepts of networking. And the author puts himself in the middle of the current development of the networking science. That helps to find the book interesting. Now about the other stories along the way, well, it looks that it was not enough information to make a book and then the stories where added. You can easily cut them without losing any flow in the explanation of science concepts or the personal story development.You can still enjoy reading it."
4,An exploration of networks in our lives,"Linked explores how networks are formed across a variety of perspectives ranging from urban development to in-person networking to the internet. I must admit, I'd be fascinated to see what the author would say about social networks, but this book was written before they were developed. With that said, this book provides some fascinating information on how networks are formed and maintained as well as giving some consideration on how people can understand and work with networks better. It's a useful book for anyone to read because it will help you understand what networking really is and what it could be."
2,Expecting more,"After reading this book, actually quite sooner than that, my reaction was: is that all there is? As one reviewer has said: there is a lot of fluff here. Instead of lingering, his arguments and explanations could have been stated more succinctly; instead of repeating, his descriptions and references could have been expanded. This is a fascinating topic that warrants a substantial treatment. However, its execution is more like a long-winded journal article than a monograph."
5,Network theory and its applications,"After reading Mitchel Resnick'sTurtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams: Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds (Complex Adaptive Systems), my exploration of decentralized networks went down a very viral path. This book, in particular, discusses the application of network theory in the context of its historical significance. The author explores how it can be used as a tool and device to understand cities, computer networks social networks, human-human interactions (speech), human-computer interactions (HCI), computer-computer interactions (protocol), diseases, computer viruses, nature. Based on this book and its related siblings, it inspires tremendous amounts of ideas for the next big thing in marketing strategy."
2,Mixed bag,"I regret to say, that this book did not provide many ""Ah Ha!"" moments for me, and I also didn't think that it was a compelling ""readable"" read. There is very valuable information contained in the book, but I look for books about popular science that are also entertaining. This was not entertaining, but instead, tedious."
3,"Interesting, but somewhat dissapointing","Barabasi gives an interesting account of what he and others have done in recent years in the field of networks. However, one thing I would've liked to see more of is the mathematics behind these ideas. Maybe it is because the book is intended for more of a general audience and not a hardcore science/math audience that Barabasi left the majority of mathematics out. He does include some when he discusses how the networks he has been dealing with follow power laws, but I would've liked to see more. I do think that the book has a nice flowing style and is easy to read. If you want an introduction to some of the current ideas about networks given in a non-technical way, then this is a good book for you."
4,The Importance of Hubs,"I really enjoyed this eminently readable book. I consumed it in one sitting last night. Not only is it intellectually stimulating, ""Linked"" has proved to be quite practical. My business involves the facilitation of entrepreneurial networks. Laszlo Barabasi's erudite explanation of scale-free networks helped me better understand a mis-match between the structure of the network we serve and the structuring and pricing of our services. The former won't change, so we're working hard to figure out how to better adapt the latter."
3,Interesting history - but not very insightful,"A little dry to begin with... but he brings up some interesting points on our linked and possibly soon to be ""Orwellian"" world of interconnected and publicly available information.Very heavy on the history of linked ""networks"" but very light on ""what it means""."
3,There was a life before...,"""Linked"" presents a reasonable overview of what was doneby physicists these last years in the fieldof networks. However, this book is very subjectiveand the author essentially cites his own workwithout almost no reference to previous important work.In particular, sociologists, mathematicians and otherphysicists worked on networks before 1999 (when Barbasipublished his first paper in the field) and thepoor bibliography does not give credit to them.In addition, the author falls short on applicationof the theory: apart from some trivial conclusionsthe theory is not yet ready to help people finding a job,improving their business or understandinga terrorists network !"
1,Missing AFTERLINK,This is a GREAT book the the Kindle edition a whole 15 pages that the print version has.I have both copies but purchased the Kindle version so that I could have it portable and use it on my computer and they're missing 15 pages... ug.I feel ripped off :-(..... UPDATETHE ENTIRE INDEX IS BROKEN.That's right. The print version has a real index with page numbers. This one has an index with the words but NO page numbers.FAIL.Good thing it's half the price :-(
5,Inspiring,"Reminds of ""The World is Flat"". It covers lots of ground really quickly. It was an interesting subject, something I've speculated a lot on my own and it was reinforcing to have a professional discuss lots of patterns (biology, physics, society, information networks) in a short-form context. It inspired me to write some graphics code based on the diagrams in the book and for that it was worth reading."
3,Novelty Wore Off,"These nonfiction books are often times very enlightening and entertaining for all 300 pages, other times they only manage to do this for about 100 pages. This book fell into the latter category."
5,Mortification's Greatest Album Ever,"This album is truly the highlight of all the Mortification stuff I've heard and got. This shows a more united band, with them finally having a consistent lineup. It has more involvement of everyone in the band, as opposed to being Steve, with a couple of guys providing the music. I didnt think that anything could top Primative Rhythm Machine, but I was proven wrong by this album. I bought Hammer of God right after I saw them live. Was a great experience, I truly recomend this album. It shows that Mortification can match it up with any of the 'great' metal bands of our time."
4,Didja know Daniel was a mosher?,"This is a very cool heavy metal album. It's metal, pure and simple, complete with a growling lead vocal and pounding riffs and drums. Vocalist/bassist Steve Rowe writes passionate lyrics about martyrdom, war with Satan, angelic visions, and the simple fact that God rules. Combine that with hard-driving music that takes control of your head and neck muscles and moves them along to the beat, and you've got a great listen. These guys make no bones about their faith and when the great war with Hell kicks off I'm sure they'll be right there up front. I'd recommend this CD to any fan of heavenly metal or metal in general."
3,Updated review,"After fortunately being blessed with one of Mortification's older cds [Break The Curse], I now look at this cd a little differently. I realize that this cd is starting to deteriorate on me a little bit. I loved this cd when i first bought it but now i just look at this as an average effort by a great christian metal band. But, I still do like some of the stuff on here. The best songs on here to me are ''Ride the light'' [Best song on here], ''Martyrs'', ''Medley'', and ''A Pearl'. While i don't really listen to this cd that much anymore, I do at least appreciate this cd for being a decent metal cd."
5,A good Christian metal album,I really like this cd. It has some great songs on it. The best songs are metal crusade and visited by an angel. I recommend this cd. It is cool.
4,"Great music, but the cover...there is an hexagram...","I am a fan of mortification, but whoever came up with the cover is misinformed about what an hexagram stands for. We all know that a pentagram is satanic, but the hexagram is as much satanic or more. There is no such thing as a star of David in the bible. Owners of the CD, please throw away the cover. Get the occultic items out of your home, lest ye be cursed. Look at what happen to Joshua when he tried to go to battle and lost because the children of Israel kept a pagan garment. If you don't believe, search wikipedia for the hexagram."
1,I'lll hammer them instead,These bible basher bands don't seem to realise WE DON'T NEED OR WANT YOU IN THE METAL SCENE.
5,We want more epizodes in English:),"My chidlren and I like very much Cedric. Cute stories from the everyday life of an 8 year old boy. The dvd has 5 epizodes. We would like to see some more in English, since this show has many seasons(unfortunately only in French)."
5,Jason,This book was one of a kind. A real pageturner!! It really paints a perfect picture on how life really was back then. A must read!!-A big fan
3,WORTH GIVING IT A SHOT,"This is an interesting book. I cannot I say I agree with the entire premise, but I did find it rather thought provoking and certainly worth considering. As always, I do have a problem with the author's absolutelisms, but hey, it is their book and they certainly have a right to their opinion. Of course books such as this will only be given their final worth with time. Sort of gives you good incentive to live to be about 200 years old, huh? Anyway, I have this one three stars simply as I did not feel it was their best work, and parts of it were sort of sloggy, but I do feel it is worth the time to read it and certainly ponder it."
4,Excellent view of strategies for the near future,"Fine book looking at how war has changed in recent decades, what is coming in the near future, and what we should do about it."
2,"""Neo-Marxist"" clap-trap","Allow me to quote from R.L. DiNardo and Danial J Hughes's article ""Some Cautionary Thoughts on Information Warfare"" Airpower Journal winter 95. ""The Tofflers' theory, a neo-Marxist concept combining economic determinism with an ocerarching chronological gramework, is reminicent of elements of the Communist Manifesto."" DiNardo and Hughes go on to state that in many instances the Tofflers are simply wrong in their analysis of historical fact, including the development of AirLand Battle. The Tofflers stand on very shaky intellectual ground and as such their prognostications should be held suspect. What is frightening is how persusasive this mode of thinking is amongst the United States military."
1,neo-Marxist nonsense,A confused mix of Marxist revisionism and conservative ideology makes for a slog of a read. The content is as non-sensical as the title.
5,I Flipped!,"I was already a fan of Jim's having read his previous book, Business Plan for the Body. I have had some success with this plan so I bought his new book and got even more practical advice and, best of all, an ""excuse squelcher."" I always used the ""I'm too busy"" excuse. I plan to read this book to accelerate the success I have already had with his first book. Bravo Jim!"
4,good but his third book is better,This book is worth a read but I would rather you read Cardio Free Diet.
1,flip the switch,I ordered flip the switch by Jim Karas. I was sent flip the switch by Robert Cooper. Not happy. This is the 2nd time this happened through amazon. no more orders from me!!! I will deal direct with book dealers.
2,Not a good game.,"the physics are easy to master. i bowled 6 strikes in a row and scored a 229 after 5 games. the graphics are ok, but the cut scenes are horrible.player creation is very detailed but the game only tracks your progress, not your bowling stats."
5,Simply The Best!,"Instead of getting one Emperor 400 filter for an 80-gallon tank, I got two Emperor 280 filters for my 50-gallon tank. That way I have been assured that I have plenty of filtration and believe me, after 15 years of doing this; you can never have TOO much filtration. I replace the carbon filters every 3-4 months, but periodically clean the `crud' off of them in the sink. I change the plastic containers that hold the ammonia crystals about the same time, also cleaning the outside of them. However, I try to stagger the cleanings every 1.5 to 2 months as changing them all at once can be stressful to my Cichlids. They work extremely well and are quiet and clean very easily. There are comparable items out there for filtration (Penguin, etc.), but I found Emperor to be the most reliable."
5,great for anyone,"First Ide like to say this is the best bang for the buck.. Wish it was an acoustic-electric but for what it is. No complaints. I bought a student version 39 in length but thats fine cuz its a full body, not a cut-away, so anything higher than the 12th fret is not happening.. This is a good guitar to learn on. I dont know about soft frets.. they seem to hold up well. of course Im not doing a lot of bending either.. I would rate the sound quality as good as any $250- 300 martin. Of course my acoustic playing is very limited.. Ive been playing electrics for 40 yrs. At least you owe it to yourself to check one of these out before buying anything...you may end up owning it for a few years before you move on.lots of pros.. (mentioned)The con: it does seem kinda cheap. and its very light. If your not careful you canFubar the thing by setting it down too hard or leaving it too close to a heat exchanger.FYI (I dont know where I read it) But this guitar is not made out of plywood."
5,Great music from a premier trumpet player.,Downloaded to my Kindle Fire. I listen to it over and over. If you like New Orleans jazz and trumpet music this is a must have.
5,This is a doggone good calendar.,"If you have a Blue Heeler in the family, this calendar is for you. Great pictures do justice to this intelligent and noble breed. These are wonderful dogs."
4,Good book!,"I've just started this book and I'm only in the second chapter, but it is already a page turner. I recommend this book."
3,Ceramics: Techniques& Projects ( A Sunset Book),"I try to find old pottery books. Here some projects are good with children. They are basic, but still I find some projects playful for me to apply to my handbuilding works."
4,My 5th one,Great watch for the price. It keeps great time and if I damage it at work I just buy another one
2,Not a Women's Watch,"I have no negatives about the watch as a functional timepiece. My only complaint is that this is wrongfully labeled as a woman's watch. It is too large for a woman's wrist. I gave it to my brother who loves it. If you want a woman's watch, this is not the item for you...unless of course, you like a huge watch that takes up the majority of your wrist. A safer bet is to go to a shop where you can actually see and size the watch yourself. This would have been a perfect watch had it been half the size. Anyone out there know of a watch that is small and discreet on a woman's wrist? I can't find one anywhere."
2,Not well made!!,Bought this fountain and it had a crack in the bowl then the coating/paint started to peel within the 2 months we had it. I have to fill it 2x a day as the water does not stay in the bowl and I am in the process of trying to send it back. Not sure I will have any luck.. Buy something else not this model as it will not last long if you do.
1,Product stopped working after 6 months,"I ordered this product through Amazon. It worked like I expected for 6 months and then one day it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I realize that blowdryers can sometimes be flaky but I feel like a $50 one should last more than 6 months. I contacted the manufacturer to replace it and they said that because I ordered it through Amazon they could not replace it for me. I couldn't find anywhere on the Amazon website to request a replacement. From what I understand, Amazon only replaces products that are brand new. So, needless to say I am a little disappointed with the quality of the product and the lack of product guarantee."
4,Very Nice for the Price,"I bought this after owning cheapy hair dryers for years. It heats up nicely and dried my fine hair in about ten minutes on the low setting. I was impressed at the softeness of my hair, and didn't need to flat iron it afterwards. It is a little heavy, but other than that it performs well for a 30 dollar hair dryer."
2,Good While It Lasted,"I purchased this dryer less than a year ago and I loved it. As the other reviewers note, the high setting is seriously high, and I've been able to dry my hair more quickly with this dryer than with any other. Unfortunately, in the last several weeks it's begun to act up: when I slide the switch to high, the dryer shuts off rather than kicking into the high setting. I contacted Conair (the actual makers of this dryer) and was told that I will receive a replacement for the dryer, as long as I am willing to pay to ship it back, pay for the return shipping of a new dryer, and wait two to three weeks (AFTER they receive my dryer) for the replacement. As I told the customer service rep, that's a long time to be without a hair dryer. I'm giving this item two stars because it's great when it works, but the durability is questionable and the warranty is far less than stellar."
2,Not a quick dryer...,"My wife has used this new dryer a few times and reports it's not quite as efficient as her old Conair dryer. After all the positive reviews, I was expecting a better result."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this hair dryer for my wife. She was in desperate need for a new one. This is not the best product on the market, but it is a great dryer and totally worth the money."
2,A little dissapointed,This is a nice dryer but two big things that are not right for me. The hot setting is not that hot and the high setting is too high. I have to dry my hair on the low setting but since the hot doesn't get that hot it still takes a while to dry my hair. I have super straight hair and when I use the high setting my hair gets so knotted its annoying (and painful). I'll keep using this because I threw out the box before giving it a week to try out but I will be replacing this at some point.
4,time saving blow dryer,cuts my blow drying time in half. My hair is smoother and easier to flat iron. Just a little heavy.
4,Awesome hair dryer,So far has not let me down!!! I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a dryer that gets it done fast
4,Good value,"I agonized over which hair dryer to buy, and I'm pretty happy I went with this one. I picked it because it's a good brand for a good price with decent reviews. It's very sturdy and it has the look of a more expensive, professional dryer. The cord is very long, which is a huge plus. The airflow is strong and doesn't get too hot. It's not the quietest or fastest hairdryer ever, but it does the trick. The only thing that drives me nuts is that I keep hitting the cool button all the time. It's in an awkward place and depresses easily. Overall, it's a strong play if you're looking for a simple, effective dryer."
4,"Love it, but...","LOVE this dryer. The difference in my hair post-blowdry was immediate, my dry time was cut in half (I have fine hair but LOTS of it) and the best part? ZERO frizz! It's so nice to be able to just blowdry and not have to use a flat iron afterwards to get the simple/sleek look I like.My one and only problem is that the concentrator has since melted a bit at the edges and now falls out very easily. The plastic it's made of just doesn't seem to hold up to the high heat. I wish there was a way to buy a replacement or even a better quality concentrator because it makes such a difference when using the dryer.So, 4 stars it is. It'd definitely get 5 without the concentrator issue."
1,Broke after 4 months of use,The button to turn the dryer from off/low/high started slipping after 4 months. Now it will not engage on high at all. It works fine on low speed and turns off when moved to high. Would not buy again.
5,Best Dryer Ever!,This dryer does what it says it does...it's quiet and dries my very thick hair in half the time! If you have thick hair - this dryer is a MUST!
5,Never thought you could love a hair dryer!!!,"I always bought cheap blow dryers at the drugstore, and will never do so again! It drys hair way faster, and my hair really is more shiny and manageable. I would't hesitate to recommend this buy, especially for that price.One very small flaw is that it is easy to press the cool down button by mistake if you don't pay attention. On the other hand, it is also very easy to reach when you do need it...:)"
5,Loooove,"This dryer is great. I will never go back to another brand. It is a little heavy, about six pounds, but it makes up for it in performance. Love dryer and would highly recommend."
3,not for me,"Way too heavy for me, it's a tank! other than that it's great! Fairly quiet low pitched hum considering the power"
4,"Awesome, but heavy!","This is a great hair dryer, but it is heavy. I was looking for something to make staightening my long hair a little faster, but the size and weight of the dryer makes it difficult."
4,"good power, quite heavy",I like the hair dryer very much. You get a very good dryer for a good price. The only reason for only 4 stars is that it's a little bit heavy. But I am trying to get use to it. (so I can train my muscles while drying my hair)
5,Great Product,Wonderful product. This blow dryer dries so fast! I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to cut blow drying time down by half!!!
1,Doesnt work!,I bought this hair dryer thinking it was the best for this price. I used it twice and really liked it. The third time it stopped working. I am returning it.
4,Great!,"This product arrived early and in great condition (exactly as described). It was a little heavier than I had expected, but I still love it!"
5,Why did I wait so long?,"I bought this dryer because of the awesome reviews but was still not sure how good it could be. Well, seeing is believing. I, like others, have been buying average dryers from local stores and hate them all. I have curly hair and like to wear it straight but because it always turns out frizzy I usually just deal with the curls. Not any longer. Since I got this dryer I have been wearing my hair straight and no more frizz. I can't even explain how happy I am with this dryer. Not only does it keep the frizz down but it is really quiet and dries my hair much quicker. It's a keeper!!!"
5,Great Hair Dryer!,"This hair dryer was definitely a smart buy! I've been using it for a month now, and I love it. It dries faster than my old dryer, and has 6 settings that are easy to use. It's quieter than my old dryer, and while it is a bit heavier, it's not too difficult to hold. A great blow dryer at a great price!"
2,Great dryer but the paint peels,"I like the way it dries my hair. It gets very hots and dries fast. However, the black covering is peeling off the dryer and every time I dry my hair I have black pieces all over. What mess!! It is heavy too."
5,Great product,"Very functional, it is a good professional dryer for a fair price.You get a fast and well done hair."
5,Hair Dryer and Mini Space Heater in Winter,I seldom review products but this hair dryer is simply AWESOME! Forget about just drying hair with it because you can do so much more. In the fall my university's dorm management wants to cheapen out on gas and leave students surviving in their cold rooms AND they ban all space heaters so they can cut down on electricity bills and give themselves a higher salary for doing nothing. Guess what? I simply turn on my babyliss pro dryer for 2 hours and I get a warm toasty room. Been doing this for 3 years + hair drying and I've owned this baby for 8 years and still going strong!
4,This dryer is great,"I really like this dryer because I have very thick hair and it does dry my hair in half the time without the damage that other dryers cause. I also use this dryer on my two ""puppy girls"" and I can dry them in half the time. One is a poodle and it would take forever to dry her. Now it's a snap.I would have given this dryer a five star, but I didn't because, like other reviews, it is a very ""forceful"" dryer. I do wish the airflow was slower, and that the ""barrel"" was ""shorter"" I did consider returning it and trying a different BaByliss dryer, but I do like the fact that my hair doesn't feel like ""straw"" after drying it. It dries my hair very nicely. I'm getting the hang of working with it. I would not order another one, however I would order another BaByliss, it's a well made product."
3,Just OK,"As other reviews have noted, this dryer is very heavy. Because it is heavy I tend to want to grasp it at the top of the handle but unfortunately that is where the 'cool' button is, so I'm always pressing the cool button by mistake. I like that it has a lot of settings and a long cord, but the weight is just too much to recommend it."
5,Terrific hair dryer,"My hair is extremely thick so it always takes a long time to dry it. With the BaByliss dryer my hair is dry in 7 to 10 minutes, as opposed to the usual 20 minutes. My hair also comes out much shinier than with any other dryer I have ever used. It is a little heavier than others, but because it drys so fast it is not really a problem. I am very pleased with this product!"
5,GREAT BLOW DRYER- GREAT PRICE,"I used this with Alfaparf Cristalli for the first time on my thick chin length very thick hair that is fried from the -30 Alaska weather, flat iron and frequent coloring. It works wonderfully! It weights average, not light or heavy. It's quiet, cuts my drying time in half and it felt much silkier and less frizzy like I had been to the salon. I'm not sure if it's the hair dryer or the Alfaparf cristalli but either way I'm happy with the results and I've tried a ton of expensive hair products in my time."
3,"Good dryer, a bit heavy","This dryer works well, but it's a bit heavier and larger than I expected for a blow dryer with ""baby"" in the title. A retractable cord feature would have been nice too."
1,Babyliss Pro Caramix Xtreme Dryer,This is the worse hair dryer I have ever had...very heavy & was broken when I got it...stuff was rolling around in it!
4,LOVE,"I bought this because my old hair dryer caught on fire in my hand - no joke. I wish I had upgraded sooner. This literally dries my hair in half the time, leaving me about ten extra precious morning minutes to get ready. It gets super hot and works well with a round brush to get my hair smooth. Only complaints - it is a bit on the heavy side (I personally don't mind because I am not drying forever, but if you have thick hair you might) and the ""cool"" button is RIGHT where my hand goes. Going to take some getting used to so I stop accidentally hitting it. Otherwise, perfect, makes me love my hair so that's priceless."
4,Good buy,"Powerful and quiet. I have always bought drug store hair dryers but they never last, so I decided to spend a bit more and for the price and quality of this dryer I am glad I did"
4,Good Hairdryer but has its Downside,"This hairdryer is very good at drying my hair. I feel it's a little heavy and the buttons are hard to use (to turn on and off). They are flat and when you have slippery fingers it's impossible to get it to turn on and off. Also some of the coating is starting to flake off (after about 6 months of use) and I have black flakes all over my bathroom. But as far as drying, it's a great hairdryer and I'll probably just live with the downsides until I need a new one."
5,"quiet, relatively; never Conair again","This one is relatively quiet. Not muffled but a dull lower sound. It is impossible to have a quiet one that is also powerful.I had one of the Conair gun type dryers and it was a high pitched loud and it felt really plasticky and cheap. On the basis of this dryer, I would never, ever buy anything from Conair again.This Babyliss has a understated look, it is not trying to look rich, no decorative trim, no imitation steel or chrome, no stupid logo that starts to chip and fade away. It feels solid but not unduly heavy. Unlike Conair, it feels like it is meant to last a while."
3,Good Dryer,"A little bit heavier than I'd like, but long cord and dryes fast. I don't know about being better for your hair. I did not notice a difference"
3,Good for the price,"I would say this hairdryer is very comparable to the higher end models of the drugstore brand hairdryers (Revlon, Conair, etc). I bought this to replace a Revlon hair dryer that I had been using for about 3 years because I started having issues with it overheating. Even though the price was so low on this Babyliss dryer, I was expecting it to perform better and it just didn't. It does work well, but I didn't notice it drying my hair any faster than normal or with any less frizz. Don't get me wrong, this is an OK hairdryer. Just don't expect to receive super great results from this dryer if you were already using a decent hairdryer to begin with. Those giving this hairdryer a 5 star rating were probably using a super cheap and old dryer before purchasing this one."
4,Great product!!,"I read all of the reviews for this product before i bought it and they are very precise. This dryer dries my hair in about 5 minutes (my old blowdryer took at least 10 minutes) and it makes my hair feel like silk. The only thing I can say that I don't like about this product is that the air flow is really strong so it can kind of blows around your hair and makes it tangly...so I would suggest using a brush! Other than that, I am completely satisfied!!"
2,Great Buy!.....or so I thought,"I just recevied my BaByliss Pro yesterday and I love it! The speed and the heat is perfect and it cut my drying time in half. I would have paid much more for this dryer. Less than $40?? This is a an amazing deal! Throw away your wimpy Revlons and Conairs and Vidal Sassoons and get this dryer!Only 4 months later and my beloved BaByliss has stopped working. Sometimes it will turn on. Sometimes it won't. When it does decide to turn on, there is no telling how long it will stay on. And once it shuts off it won't start up again for several minutes (if at all). Very disappointed because I really loved this dryer...for the few months that it worked."
5,One of the best!,"I am a hair stylist and am buying this hair dryer as a replacement for the exact one I just broke. =( I use this hair dryer for clients and personal use. I accidently kicked it ""on"" the other night on my floor. It was covered by a blanket, I was half asleep and the motor burnt out. I'm lucky all I lost was the hair dryer!! Whew! Anyways, this hair dryer is powerful enough to take on my massive amount of hair and completely dry it in 10 minutes. Other hair dryers I have tried, Hot Tools, Conair, Revlon...etc, have always taken at least 25-30 minutes to dry my hair. My hair feels healthier after drying it with this dryer compaired to others as well, I like to use it on the hot setting, then use the cool shot button for a minute or two at the very end to get my hair nice and shiny. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a professional grade product."
2,Way too heavy,Brought this for my wife because of all the good review and it was a bad idea. She complained that it was so heavy that she had a hard time drying her hair. Feels like there is a small lead weight inside. No idea how a hair styled could hold this al day. It is quieter than the old one probably cause less airflow.
4,fab,love it! best hair dryer i ever bought by far. fantastic. made my hair so big! seriously worth the price.
3,Kind of wish I'd gone cheaper,"I think the almost-$40 for this dryer is over-priced. The feature set and the quality really don't justify paying more than half that. I have an old one that I think I got at Target for about $20 and I got this as a replacement because I doubt that old one's gonna last a lot longer. I still use the old one! I'm thinking about putting this on eBay. If I can get half what I paid, I'm ordering one much less costly."
5,BaByliss,"This blow dryer works great and dries my hair in no time. Very powerful ceramic blow dryer at a good pricw. A little heavier, but much better than the ones at the local stores."
3,I don't hate it but I wouldn't buy it again,"There are a few design flaws in this dryer that aren't so annoying that I returned it, but are bad enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Firstly, the temperature and on/off switches are not raised at all so it's difficult to move them--especially when you are right out of the shower and have lotion and/or hair gel on your hands. I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled. I usually have to stop mid-dry to brush all the tangles out. And even though it's so powerful, I don't feel like my actual dry time is shortened."
1,Won't heat up! BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,"With all of the rave reviews, I figured this was THE hair dryer to buy. How could 300+ people be wrong? Well, from my experience, it isn't. Not only was the heating element dead right out of the box so all it blows is room temperature air but it's WAY heavy and unbalanced. They should call it the BaByliss POS!"
3,I don't like it.,"Well I bought it with the understanding that I was buying a worth while product. Unfortunately this was not what I was expecting. Not only was it heavy the buttons are positioned in such a way that you don't have these ease to turn it on and off when necessary. So that you can blow dry and shut it as you go along. It was also too hot which I thought I would appreciate but no I didn't because it would burn my scalp, fingers and hair. I gave this one away."
3,pretty good dryer...,I returned this for the more expensive Babyliss... They're both good hairdryers... but this version reminds me more of my Conair 1800 dryer...The 60$ version is more powerful...worth the money... and served me well for the past 3 years.... It's like a salon dryer...Love it!
3,good but heavy,"It was heavy, which I can adjust to, however the nozzle was too small. I didn't feel like I was ever going to finish drying my hair! So this is why I returned it. I gave it 3 stars b/c it is probably a good hair dryer, but I only used it once."
1,Very Disappointed,"I will never buy a BaByliss hairdryer again. I paid $80 on sale at a beauty products store. Within four months the heat sensor kept coming on and turning the dryer off. It comes on after about one to two minutes use! I can't even finish my hair. What a disappointment for my first ""quality"" and expensive dryer."
3,"Ok, but not as good as the review let you believe","The hairdryer is better than my last, but still takes awhile to dry. The reviews were right in explaining that it is pretty heavy. Not bad, but not thrilled."
2,Good for 8 months,"This hairdryer worked great when first purchased - very powerful for its price.Unfortunately, 8 months later, the high speed setting no longer works. With long hair, this makes the dryer all but redundant unless you want to commit your entire morning to your hair. The rubber around the handle has also started to fray and peel. The dryer was never put under any more stress than you would expect - used to dry hair once every other day, stored in the bedroom away from steam and humidity.I can't recall if it came with a warranty (I assume it did; although the box, instructions, etc were lost during a move). If you do buy this dryer, I recommend keeping hold of all that information just in case. I emailed the seller to see if they could help on the warranty situation but never got a response."
1,Hair Fryer,"I had been using an ionic hair dryer for years. When it was time to buy a new one, I thought I'd try something that appeared to have newer technology. This dryer made my hair dry, brittle, and fly-away. Back to my old brand."
1,Very Disappointed...barely lasted 4 months with avg. use.,Bought this item at the end of July and it is already not working. I am the only one who uses it and it is used on average 5 times per week. Return window is only 90 days:(
5,Gift,"The girls just love this blow dryer, it has plenty of power and I would get this again if needed."
2,Junk,"I bought this dryer in August, 2012, by December it stopped working. I contacted Conair's customer service and was told that since it was still under warranty they would fix it, but I would have to pay postage for their defective item, which was $16.00. It has been a month since I sent it to Conair and I have still have not gotten it back. When it worked it worked great, Conair = Con-job."
4,Great Dryer! Saved My Natural Hair!,I bought this hair dryer because my stylist uses it. My hair is natural and we all know what humidity does to natural hair. It does an amazing job resulting in very little to no frizz because it dries hair so well!
4,"Good, not great","I had used a friend's BaByliss hairdryer while staying at her house, and it was awesome! It made my hair look the best it had ever looked, dried it so quickly, and it was so stinkin' shiny! Of course, I immediately came home and went on amazon and found this hairdryer. I saw the price and was so excited! So I bought it.I'm not sure if it's not the correct hairdryer, is a different model or a different year, but the other dryer was way better. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice product. But it's pretty heavy, not quite as powerful, and is just overall more like a drugstore hairdryer rather than a salon one. It does the job, but is definitely not the best hairdryer I've ever used."
3,meh-heavy dryer--ok for the price,"This did work better than the dryer I usually use from the drug store. Frizz and poofiness was reduced somewhat but it honestly wasn't THAT great. I still had a lot of frizz...I have naturally thick, coarse, frizzy hair. I'm returning it to Amazon and investing in a better hair dryer. I want something that leaves my hair with a smoother finish. It's also quite heavy."
3,Great price,Good price for this dryer. It is very powerful and good quality but it is extremely heavy.
2,Marketing lie or dangerous device?,"If you buy this thinking this is a 2000W dryer, please keep this in mind. Mathematically that is not possible. A 2000W hair dryer running on a 110 circuit would draw 17 Amps of power. The cord and plug used are designed for a maximum load of 15A. So either their marketing folks have lied, which I hope is the case for SAFETY reasons, or this hair dryer is designed to draw more current than it's socket was designed for. To truly draw 17A would require a 20A circuit and a 20A rated outlet with the weird plug that has a keyed sideways prong.This is probably a good hair dryer but truth in marketing is gone."
3,Ok,"I bought this after all the hype about it and I can honestly tell you that my 15 year old hair dryer gives me the exact same results.This hairdryer made me belive that my hair would dry faster, it didn't. It made me belive I would have less frizz than my previous dryer, it didn't. All in all I didn't have to buy this and just continue using my old hair dryer which is fine."
1,Way too heavy!,This hairdryer is beyond heavy. I have very thick hair and it usually takes me an hour to dry it completely straight. No way can I use this heavy thing for 1 hour. Disappointing.
2,Not loving this dryer,"I ordered this dryer because BaByliss has a good reputation, and everyone else seems to like it. So I was kind of surprised to find myself hating this hair dryer...Pros:Hot is hotGood powerCons:HeavyReally loudVibrates a lotBecause it's heavy, it tends to slip in my hand until I am pressing the blue cold air button. I feel like I'm fighting with it all the time! Needless to say, I will be looking for an alternative..."
4,very good hairdryer,This is the product my hairdresser uses on me (highend salon) and I love the way my hair comes out. I am a perfectionist so for the most part I am very pleased with it. It is very hot..which I love. It usually takes me about 30 minutes to staighten/dry my hair. Using this dryer it now takes me about 25 minutes. I am a little disappointed it only shortened my drying process 5 minutes. I've only had it for 2 months so we'll see how long it lasts. My hairdresser said she has had hers for 2 years.
1,Hair Dryer stopped working after less than 6 months!,"Hair dryer worked well for the first five months, then started shutting off on its own every time I turned it on. Customer Service would not allow me to return this item for a refund or replacement, because the ONE MONTH return window had expired. DO NOT BUY!!! Quality items should last more than 6 months, and I should be able to return a defective/broken item within such a short time frame since purchase."
2,LOVED it... broke 5 months later... not so much love now,"Fabulous hair dryer. HOWEVER, after my last trip (got home Sunday 6/13) and my hair dryer did not make it. now loud clunking noises ... obviously something inside broke. warranty? um... not really...exactly how long would you consider average or acceptable to be on the phone for customer service? 10 min? 20 min? how about 53 min before i got ""disconnected"". i only stayed on hold for 22 min the 2nd time before i gave up.LOVE amazon... HATE the customer service (or lack thereof) of BaByliss"
1,Not a Great Hairdryer,"This is the worst hairdryer I have ever purchased. Neither of the settings are low enough to not tangle my hair into knots, which I have never seen a hairdryer do before. Its heavy, and my hair is a wreck by the time I use it for only 5 minutes. I will never buy this brand again."
3,A decent dryer,This hairdryer does have some oomph to it! It also has temp choices. I like the velvety grip on the handle. It does not seem to dry as thoroughly as an ionic or ceramic variations.
3,Shorter drying time,"I bought this hair dryer after my Coroliss Apollo broke. It came quickly so kudos to the seller.As far as my experience. I have relatively fine hair (don't get me wrong, it's not thin, but it's fine). It's the kind of hair that looks amazingly full after a wash and blow dry but can fall limp mid day. This hair dryer dries my hair much quicker- let's say 5 min versus the 10 or so prior and it also makes my hair feel dry. That may be the cost for more efficient drying. I'm not complaining though- my hair retains its fullness bc it doesn't get weighed down with oil as easily, but this may bother others. Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars. It's a good buy for the price."
5,The only brand of hair dryer I will own from now on!,"My daughter has the kind of hair everyone wants - full, thick, full-bodied and long. That being said, her hair is extremely difficult to manage. I bought this hair dryer because we've burned up several in the past several years and needed to find something more substantial to handle her hair. This dryer dries her hair in about 2 minutes (usually took 7-8 minutes) and it doesn't blow it around so much that it becomes more ""poofy"" after drying it. It takes me less than a minute to dry mine.The hot setting isn't super hot, like most other dryers I've owned and this could be why the hair isn't frizzed out at the end of drying. The air flow is strong enough that we leave it on the medium setting.Also worth mentioning is the fact that I found this exact same dryer at at BB&Beyond; for $25 more. I buy everything I can from Amazon these days!!"
5,So far So good.,"Nice hair dryer. Does the job efficiently. Hope it lasts a year. I seem to replace hair dryers every year. Funny thing is I only blow dry 2x a week. Babyliss has a good reputation for quality, particularly on the professional level. Spent the extra money hoping for better quality. So far, So good."
5,Seems like a great dryer,Time will tell but this is the best one I've bought in a long time. A tad on the heavy side but it seems to be built to last. I can work with both speeds. The low speed is pretty quiet which is good when the wife is sleeping in.
4,Great Dryer,"The dryer is awesome. My hair is thick and curly, but this dryer straighten really nice. It took little or no time for my hair to dry. I also like the soft body of the dryer. I would say the only thing was I don't like the control switch, it's to flat and it's difficult to adjust say when you have oil or satin hair product residue on your hands."
5,babyliss pro ceramix xtreme dryer,"This is a great hair dryer, light in weight and has lots of power. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,so so,"I previously was using a $25 ConAir hairdryer that was 1750, and I don't notice much of a difference between the results of that dryer andt this one. Plus the BaByliss is much heavier!!It's a fine dryer, but the $25 ConAir delivers the same results."
2,Heavy,"This is a very sturdy dryer and I'm sure would be good for a professional, but for me doing my own hair it is very heavy and unweildy. And I wasn't able to maneuver the buttons with just one hand. It may be a very good dryer but for me was just too hard to use myself so I had to send it back."
2,I think it cooked my hair,"When I first received this hair dryer, I thought it was great. It is not as heavy as I was worried it would be, and it dried my thick hair very fast on the high setting - manageable and with a shine. However, as I continued to use it on an almost daily basis, I noticed my hair getting drier and more brittle, less manageable - it just seemed damaged and unhealthy. I bought new shampoos thinking that might help, but it didn't. Finally, I resorted to using a different hair dryer, the Conair Infiniti. It takes slightly longer to dry, but my hair has quickly returned to its healthy state. Perhaps the high-heat, high-blower setting on the BaByliss was too much for my hair, but the lower settings took forever to do the job. At $50, this was an expensive mistake to make."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this hair dryer about six months ago. I loved how well it worked and how fast it dried my hair. And then, one day, it just stopped working. It's not worth the money for a hair dryer that only lasts six months."
3,It is ok but not over my expectation,"This product has a high review and price is good considering almost 50%off. However, it is nor beyond my expectation. I think $30 is a fair price for it. The wind is gentle. But it does not dry my hair fast. And it is a little noisy."
4,Great dryer!,"Great power! My long hair dries much quicker now. My old hair dryer was 10 years old. It was time to replace.. After I started using this product, my hair actually looks and feels healthier than before. Love it! I only wish it was little lighter. It's not too bad though since you don't have to hold it too long."
4,Good product,this particular blow dryer came recommended by my stylist. It works great stays hot and dries my hair in a timely manner.
5,Best dryer ever!,They say you get what you pay for and I agree totally. I have always just thought a blow dryer was a blow dryer and then I bought this one...boy what a difference!!! Even though I have a short hair cut I still need my hair to dry as straight as possible and the heat settings on this is fantastic!! Great investment!
5,Best blowdryer in this price range!,"I used to be a die-hard proponent of Conair hairdryers (quality + longevity), but after hearing so many good things about BaByliss from friends, I decided to give it a shot. I was debating between this product and a higher end dryer in their line, and ultimately, I am glad I chose this one. All the higher end dryers I've tried significantly reduce the time it takes to dry my hair, but they are also extremely hot and tend to make my hair flat. I use the hottest setting on this one and while it takes me about 15 mins. to dry my hair (medium thick, wavy), I feel like it creates a good balance between heat level/time/volume/silkiness. The cool shot button is easy to access when I'm curling the ends of my hair in/out. I was also worried that this particular dryer would be really heavy, but I got used to it quickly and it's not an issue at all. I'm happy with this product and I'm hoping it lasts a long time!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had this unit for approximately a year now. I purchased it along with a Sony 42"" Grand WEGA RP-LCD.This system is good for a small room, but it is not nearly loud enough for a normally-sized living room. The satellites don't become effective until you have the volume cranked to the 60s (out of 70) and the subwoofer doesn't pump out nearly enough bass.It's obviously tailored towards a casual user, which is perfect for the price. Wish I had just gotten something louder.Also, this system has 2 remotes: 1 for the receiver, and 1 for the DVD/VCR. You have to use both unless you get a universal.The Good:+ Cheap+ Includes all cables+ Easy to setupThe Bad:- WEAK POWER- 2 remotes: 1 for receiver, 1 for DVD/VCR- Subwoofer is sub-par. Not enough bass."
4,nice rendition of space invaders but the controls disappoint,"It's a nice game, except for the controls. The joystick control which moves the tank left and right is not precise enough to play the game well. The arcade game used buttons for left and right, recognizing the importance of timing to dodge the incoming missiles."
1,V1 Steam Engine,This kit is not for beginners. You will need to get a hobbysize butane tourch to put the boiler together and small dia solder. The casting the cylinder is to mate to is not machined so the steam just pours ou every where. No pressure relife valve on the boiler. The casting and piston mateing part have to be resurfaced for a perfect fit. I have had years of experince in precision parts so that I did get the motor running but not to the point it could be used for anything
3,ok,I ordered this volume of the timeless classics because I wanted to share them with my grandchild. This one was OK but disappointing. I remembered this as better than it actually was. Also my grandchild did not enjoy this as well as the other volumes.
2,Great until it broke,"Awesome product that has everything I needed, but while using the hex wrench my entire tool just broke apart. The internals that held the wrenches together just exploded out, and now I have a bunch of worthless components."
2,awesome till it exploded,"Had it for about 6 months but when I was torqueing on my seat rails, the metal rod inside snapped sending my entire multitool allen keys all over the trail."
4,great tool,could use a 10mm wrench and knife blade too but other then that this thing has everything
1,Very poor is far too generous a description.,This book is very poorly written but fortunately this doesn't matter too much as the author has so little to say. It was presumably written for the author's benefit as I cannot imagine that any reader has ever gained anything useful from reading it. This is probably the worst book I have ever read on radiotherapy treatment planning.
5,wonderfully enjoyable,"This is my first Julia London book and I enjoyed it completely. Good solid characters, well written. I highly recommend it. The Regency period is one I would have loved to have lived -- as an aristocrat with antibiotics of course!!"
3,Hated the heroine!,"This was not Julia London's best effort. The plot line was slow and the romance was nil. There was zero sexual tension, zero hero jealousy, and the tired marriage of convenience theme.There was too much repertoire between Ava and her sister and not enough going on with the hero.I felt the h/h were in love only because the author tells us they were. There is no build up to the grand climax. I just kept waiting for it and nothing happened.I gave it three stars because I really enjoyed JL's older work. For a great read, check out ""Wicked Angel""."
4,Breathe Taking!,I seriously couldn't put the book down. It was a riveting love story. I really got into it. I think that if you are looking for a good romance then this a good one to pick. You'll love it. Well I did so I hope you too.
1,heroine is not a very likeable,"Geeze it is terrible!!!!! The Fairchild clan learns that their stepfather ran away with their late mother's money. Ava, the eldest of this clan, locates Jared Broderick, the Marquis of Middleton and heir to a dukedom and he marries her. She should feel lucky!! Especially in light of who she could have ended up married too. The endless mind games she played with Jared were not a sign of a smart go to gal who knows what she wants, which is I think was Ms. London was going for. Instead, she comes across as manipulative, which makes any romance with her and the actually very nice Jared unrealistic. A very poor romance. In fact, I would say a very frustrating one. Half way through any romance book, you have to be rooting for H/H to get together, declare their love and live happily ever after. In this one, you hope Jared can get a divorce!!!!"
2,Broken Wheels,"A very useful tool, but a wheel broke while I was standing on it and I almost fell. I am not a large person so I cant imagine this scaffold holding up under the weight of a large person. I am currently looking for replacement wheels but they cost almost as much as the entire scaffold."
1,Product Never Delivered,"The supplier failed to deliver the product even though it was ordered on November 27th, almost a month prior to Christmas. The service reps were completely clueless, and of no help. I cancelled this order on December 24th, yes, Christmas Eve as the ""big surprise"" gift failed to come. Never ever again will I order from Shopzeus as they have shown a complete lack of customer service, and no clue how to get a product delivered in a reasonable amount of time."
5,A must for a child intersted in airplanes,This is a wonderful book for children intersted in airplanes. The pictures are clear and the information is written in a very understandable language for children. Would highly recommend.
3,Works great...bad USB port,"I've used the QDisk as a backup drive for my laptop for 9 months now. The drive works great with Windows XP, no driver issues, plug and play. The USB 2 connection is fast. The only problem I have with the drive is that the USB port in the drive broke off. I've been pretty careful with the drive, I occasionally take it back and forth from work - I didn't drop kick it or anything. The port just fell out as I was plugging it in."
5,First Class Brad,"This item was well packaged, delivered on time and it is as all Brads CDs are, first class music. Another great Brad CD to add to my collection."
5,It fits,"For anyone who likes BP this CD will fit nicely into the collection. No shocks or surprises, just good music."
5,WOW!,"""Who Needs Pictured"" is one of the best country CD's I have ever heard! It is great to see a guy from your hometown area make it big in something this huge. Way to go Brad! He has really got a bright future ahead of him!"
1,He Didn't Have to be,"I bought this cd after seeing ""He Didn't Have to be"" on CMT. ""He Didn't Have to be"" touched my heart and made me cry that night so when I bought this cd I was very excited. However, to be honest, other than that one song I really didn't like this cd much at all. I should have just bought the single and called it a day. Oh well, ya win some and ya lose some."
2,rodeo clone,"Here he is, fresh-faced fodder from the Nashville clone factory, ripe and ready for the new country meat grinder. Not that this West Virginia native didn't work hard to get where he is. He's an accomplished songwriter covered by folks like Tracy Byrd and cowrote or wrote every song this debut, a rarity in this genre. But despite some notable moments of appropriately silly two-steppin' wordplay (Me Neither, Don't Breathe) and solid balladeering (Who Needs Pictures, In the Garden), Who Needs Pictures breaks no boundaries, tests no standards and bares no teeth. It's an above average debut but it still suffers from the same nagging predictability and benign qualities that have come to define Nashville at its worst."
4,Fantastic Singer!,"I absolutely loved two of the titles: Me Neither, and He Didn't Have To Be. This was a great album overall. I love his new stuff more than this current album, but as always, Brad Paisley never disappoints. You will listen to this album over and over!Enjoy!"
3,No Cup Pocket/Pouch,"This product appears to be well made and relatively comfortable (as comfortable as an athletic supporter can be, at least).Just be clear that it does not have a cup pocket/pouch, in spite of the description. That is why I purchased it, but it's not worth sending back."
1,Do not buy if you need S-Video out,"We bought this specifically for S-Video out. The box and specs on the outside mention S-Video out but fails to mention that the VHS will not output through S-Video. On top of that, it says you should not have the component video and S-Video out connected at the same time because the picture may be ""unstably"" (sic).The other features may work fine, but the product packaging is misleading."
2,DVD Player Quit,"A refurbished unit of this model was purchased for me as a gift. It is easy to set up. It is a DVD player and a VHS recorder/player. I am not so much bothered by the lack of a TV tuner as I was not having a display to tell me the tape location of the VHS, which is handy when you are recording on tape from the TV. I had a Panasonic that split up the recordable area of the tape into five sections, beginning to end.As my title suggests, even more distressing was the fact that the DVD player quit recognizing DVDs a year after I received it. I tried using several wet and dry cleaners to no avail. I can still play them on my computer, so I know the DVDs are not the problem. The VHS player still works.As I indicated, it is a refurbished unit, so this opinion should not carry as much weight as those for units bought as new items. Nevertheless, my experience was not a good one."
3,Meets my needs,"I bought this as a replacement for a VCR. I was aiming to get a fairly inexpensive unit that would record and play VHS tapes. It does both of these things just fine. I haven't even tried the DVD player. As others have noted, it doesn't have the coax antenna connection, but I don't need that connection. I'm happy with it."
1,disappointed,"I purchased this unit from Discount Jungle. When it arrived, I could not find a cable input/ouput jack on the back. When I called their customer service department, the man was less than helpful & told me that I would have to pay a reshelving fee if I were to return the item. After ""haggling"" with the ""customer service"" department, they did offer to forego this reshelving fee. This purchase was not worth the hassle & aggravation. I sent it to my daughter who has her own business & deals with electronics on a daily basis. Phillips is usually a good product. I think it was the supplier. I will not purchase electronics online again."
3,Good Unit But Shoddy repackaging,"The unit seems to work fine but the seller sent it out with the operator's manual highlighted from a previous owner, no batteries for the remote and missing a cord."
1,HORRIBLE,"This has got to be the worst camera i have ever used and even ever seen... its pictures dont save, no zoom, horrible blurry pictures, this is worth 5 dollars, i would have given it 0 stars for everything but 1 star is the worst i can put down.. listen to me on this and dont get this camera, its the worst, cheapest, peice of plastic you can buy on the market..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I was extremely disappointed with this so called digital camera. I felt like I couldn't go wrong because it was so inexpensive. The camera worked only one day and didn't work any longer. The pictures I took for the one day that I had the camera didn't come out very well at all. I returned the camera because I thought the camera was broke because the pictures came out so awful and the camera stop working. I was sent another camera and it still didn't work. What a piece of junk.
1,A BIG piece of junk!,I got this camea from a friend for my birthday. We took goofy pictures at my party later and tried to install the disc. It wouldn't work. We tried it three more times and read the instructions about FIVE more times then gave up. Some files on my computer were broken and my poor computer ended up with a virus. Save your money and time (and your computer) and DO NOT buy this camera!
5,it servers its purpose,"This toy, I like to call it a cameria, but it severs it purpose. I read many reviews on how bad this cameria is, it is as good as whoever is looking though its view finder. You have to have the right light in order for you to get picture perfect pics. Also you can use the software that is included to improve the picture quallity if your not a pro, all and all it serves it's purpose"
2,It has its uses (web cam),"My daughter got this for a Christmas present, she finally got around to using it. As much as it is for a kid. it does not the most kid friendly software, it took me a little while to teach her how to use it. Not the greatest pictures but then again IT IS a kids TOY. THE ONE GOOD THING we have found with it. Is the web cam part of it. With family of out state and Internet connections, we are able to talk through a messenger and they can see her as they type to each other."
1,Very disappointing,"I wanted to take fun pictures and videos. I can't figure out the video part, and the pictures don't come out most of the time, and the ones that do are blurry. I tried to download all my cool pictures I took and the computer said that there wern't any pictures to download. Where did they go? The phone number to call for help to figure out the different modes told me that I'd have to wait for 45 minutes!! Yikes! very disappointing"
3,Fun for the Money,I found this camera at a reduced price...and felt I couldn't go wrong. It needs fairly good lighting and does pretty good outdoors. It download easily and I would recommend it for children. No great loss if damaged. Teaches them the basics of camera / computer interface. The photos are only good for emailing and viewing on a PC. Forget printing these bad boys up. USB connection required.
4,it is fun but sometimes it dies on you,when I first got this it worked very well but sometimes it woudn't turn on so I had to take out the batterys and put them back in or I needed new batterys but other than that it worked great.
1,digital camera by saktar international,"this is one of the worst digital cameras i have ever seen. the screen dosen't show the picture and i dont have a port to make the pictures. in two words ""it sucked ""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cuban comfort music...,Purchased this disc because I heard it at a listening station here in NYC. This makes for great cooking music or background music. Sit on your front porch and enjoy a cold rum and coke!
1,Philips is trouble,"I have had this television for over a month. I was not able to access the ""Menu"" portion of the screen, thus I was not able to get digital cable. I ordered the television from the Philips online site, and their customer service in dealing with me has been absolutely terrible. I have had to fax my warranty to them 3 times - and each time they claimed they didn't recieve it, and then I emailed them my warranty twice. Don't deal with Philips, they don't know what they are doing."
2,Dont buy it,"The picture is good, but it has been nothing but problems. The TV constantly buzzes very loudly. The plastic trim always falls off as well. Best Buy has been out to repair twice, but they cant make it stop buzzing. Im going to return it for a panasonic this week."
1,bad quality,I purchased this Television from Best Buy a few months back. The front black section that goes around the whole tv has seperated from the television I constantly have to press it back on especially if the tv is on for a while . My assumption is that the glue they used to make attach this part is heat sensitive and it melts everytime the tv heats up. Considering that heat generation is one of the problems with Plasma tv in general it seems as if Philips would have had a handle on this problem. This is unfortunate since this is not a cheap television therefore one would assume better quality products would be used. Unless you enjoy having the front of your television falling off like an old pair of pantyhose when your friends are over oohing and ahhing this probably isnt the tv for you.
1,50 inch plasma,"So far we have replaced the signal board 3 times too no avail. Picture gets continuously worse with every repair. Luckily I purchased with my Amex card and Amex credited the full amount back to my card until I am satisfied with the service. Don't buy Philips, horrible customer service. Will update later with results."
1,Piece of Junk,"We took our tv out of the box a week ago, and today it died. The picture simply turned off. We tried to turn it back on, but to no avail. When we called Philips directly they said it would have to be sent in for repair or that we could just take it back to the store.The store took it back no questions asked, which was nice, because on top of this problem, there were several others. For example, the tv seemed to put out a great deal of heat. There was also a steady buzzing noise coming from the speakers and an obnoxious thin stripe along the left hand edge of the screen. We exchanged it for the Panasonic and we are happy so far!"
1,DON'T BUY.,"I had the 42"" model for a year. After 8 service calls, Circuit City gave me a new one. This size was discontinued so I tried the 50"" It started with the same problems on the first day: turns off and on at will, half the picture goes blank, I could go on. Progressive problems througout the year. Picture is good, ambilight is beautiful (that had a recal) but it the model is a lemon. Before you write a review here, live with the TV for a while."
3,Star Charm,"Within the month the gold has wore off the star on the charm. Good price on the charm, but hoped for a bit better quality."
3,WWE is in need of an dire miracle!,"Now enough is a d*mn nough.Ive had all I can take of seeing this clown respresent Raw as their WWE champion.What is happening to the WWE?Remember in the old days when the WWE was such a hit and the Austin/McMahon rivalry was strong and the Rock and Stone Cold had unbelievable matches that captivated audiiences.Or when Bret Hart and the war with Canada vs America was at its peak also.Well I do and I miss those days,but anyway back to the point its just like the WWE throws stuff together nowadays and can really give a d*mn what sh*t that they throw to America and call it a 'match'.I mean if you look at past WWE shows and watch the matches that were like back, then and then you watch the ones now then you see a complete difference.What ever happened to the spark that entertained wrestling fans in the mid to late 90's?What ever happened to that special 'feeling'.Well to be honest I dont know but as I said in the title of my review WWE is in need of an dire miracle."
5,Survivor Series Predictions;,Melina will be the new womens champion.Chris Benoit will win the best out of 7 series against Booker T.Eric Bischoff will beat Teddy Long in an G.M's match after interference from various superstars.Ric Flair will beat Triple H in an last man standing.John Cena will beat Angle by d.q after guest referee Muhammad Hassan turns on Cena.Taker will return and beat up Randy Orton leading to an Hell in An Cell Match at either Armageddon or the Royal Rumble.Team Raw will beat Team Smackdown.Ok this may not happen but before you get your (...)in an bunch you can go to (...) late tonight or tomorrow for the full results of the 2005 Survivor Series.
5,GREAT MATCH,"LET ME JUST SAY THIS WAS THE GREATEST MATCH I HAVE EVER SAW. I WAS THERE LIVE YO! IT ALL STARTED WHEN THE ROCK PULLED ON HIS CUB CADET LAWN MOWER AND RAN OVER SOME REPORTER AND ALL YOU SAW WAS HIS HANDS AND FEET SHOOT OUT THE SIDE IT WAS AWESOME!!! THEN THE MATCH STARTED IT WAS THE HULK VS JOHN MELONCAMP. JOHN TOOK THE LEAD WITH HIS WORLD FAMOUS TUMBLE TUCK KICK. THE HULK WAS OUT COLD FOR 35 MINUTES AND THEN THE MATCH ENDED AND JOHN WON WITH A KO! THEN IT WAS CENA VS SPIDERMAN, AND OF COURSE SPIDEY STARTED OFF WITH HIS TRADEMARD WEBBLASTER TO THE FACE, BUT CENA DOMINATED THE REST OF THE MATCH. AFTER THAT VINCE MCMAHON CAME OUT AND BREAK DANCED ON THE MATCH AND BATMAN FLEW OUT FROM BACKSTAGE AND KICKED THE CRAP OUT OF HIM. IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!I RATE THIS MATCH 11/10 YO!!!!"

5,Ric Flair finally got what was coming to him after 20 years!!,"In the NWA and WCW, Ric Flair was the leading member of the Four Horsemen and did whatever he could to hold on the NWA world championship (Currently around Jeff Jarrett) and the WCW championship (Renamed world heavyweight championship and worn by Angle for the 2nd time). He single-handedly injured Sting and anyone else who tried to take his world heavyweight championship and enigneered the demise of Hogan at the 1991 Survivor Series when he lost to the Undertaker. Ric Flair finally met his match in a determined and focused Triple H. Triple H finally broke free from Flair and Triple H is clearly the dirtest player in the Game and he was the one to finally give Ric Flair what he deserved. Ric Flair had it coming and after 19 years, it finally happened.Triple H crushed Ric Flair and it was about time."
2,Bad Survivor Series,"This is the worst Survivor Series EVER! If it wasn't for the return of Undertaker, I would gave it a 1 star! No one should get it! It's a waste of money."
2,The Truth,"Look, Cena can't wrestle. AJ can. I agree with daywalker. but stop argueing on frickin' amazon.com. go to a wrestling forum. i have no problem with it, i've said a few swears in my day. but anyway this did suck major a$$. The matches simply can't compete with TNA's death defying matches. I spent $35 that I killed myself earning for this junk? Tna ppv's rule. The one reason WWE will never die is Wrestlemania. By the way see you there. I'll be holding a sign that says THANK YOU MOM. I waited 12 hours for those 200 dollar tickets. Anyways, in the next few years, be ready to see a wrestling war. Long Live...Wrestling"
5,John Cena is an embarrasement as WWE champ!,"Ya darn skippy.John Cena has been champ for 9 months and Im ready to see someone else as champion.Plus he's a thug and likes to freestyle and rap like he's Eminem or Kanye West.Well listen here bro,if you wanna sing and rap and do your thing then quit WWE like Chris Jericho did (because he wanted to make records with that dumb @ss group Fozzy )and get a deal with Cash Money or G-Unit or something because you suck as a wrestler 4 real.World Life!Other people that Id like to see as WWE champ besides Cena;Shawn MichaelsEdgeTriple HKurt Angleand others."
3,F&CK CENA,"D@#$ right, Brian. I am sick and tired of Cena having the belt. I really ticks me offf that the WWE has BOTH champions winning constantly. It isnt intresting anymore with Cena as the champ all the time F?CK CENA. The Cerebral Assasin rules. I am not biased but I am getting sicka nd tired of it like a lot of other fans. Coem on Kurt.Kurt kicks Cena's A$$Booker beats BenoitSmackdown! team winsThe Game beats FlairMelina beats Trish"

4,WWE Survivor Series 2005 review,"The Booker T-Chris Benoit match was a hard-hitting,high-tech & pretty good and the same goes for the Trish Stratus-Melina-Women's title match. The HHH-Ric Flair-Last Man Standing match was a bloody,ruthless,hardcore & a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The John Cena-Kurt Angle-WWE title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth bout. The Theodore Long-Eric Bischoff match was a dumb,boring,childish waste of time. The Team Smackdown-Team Raw-10 man tag team elimination match was a hard-hitting,enertaining,high-flying,back-and-forth tag bout.I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
3,Survivor Series 2006,"The main event for Survivor Series will be a survivor series classic match like last years.It will be ""Team ECW"" vs. ""Team WWE"". With ECW coming back full time and another ECW 1 night stand, Vince will decide to spice it up a little with WWE vs. ECW almost like in 2001. Im guessing there will be 2 guys from smackdown and 3 guys from raw vs. 5 guys from ECW.My Predictions:Team WWE- Rey Mysterio, Kurt Angle, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and CarlitoTeam ECW- Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, CW Anderson, and Axl Rotten. I think this might turn into a hardcore elimination match.Also- World Heavyweight championship match- Batista vs. ???Probably Trish Stratus(WWE) vs. Jazz(ECW)"
