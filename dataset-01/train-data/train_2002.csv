4,Good Value,"Does exactly what I expected it to do - fits on my Delta drill press and gets the job done. Is it perfect? In a word: No. However, for most of your sanding needs it serves its purpose. My final analysis: a solid product at a fair price. A good value overall."
1,timothythetoolman,The drums won't stay on the rubber holders unless you really tighten them. If you do that then the drum bubbles out in the center and makes it hard to get a straight sanded side on your stock. It was bad enough that I purchased an osculating table sander.Tim
4,Descent kit for the price,"I only use these ocassionally so for me these are well worth it. If your a serious woodworker, these may not do it."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Really good music let down by extremely poor overprocessed sound restoration. I have all these tracks on various old LPs and the sound on this is no improvement and in most cases worse. Not in the class of reissue labels like Jazz Oracle, Retrieval, Timeless or Frog. A great shame!"
3,Decent non big budget suspense film,"Good lower budget film that has a decent pilot and acting, kind of a surprise considering it was not a big named film and had a cast of unheard of people in it. But does contain a lot of language,some sexual dialogue, and some nudity so nothing different than most films have but not for someone under 16 to watch."
1,Waste of time,"Movie was a waste of time, low budget flic with nudity, poor acting, horrible dialog, foul language and reference to homosexuality. The movie is called the Devil's Racecourse but I have no idea why, there was no race just four girls and 1 guy hiking in the woods that run into a serial killer with two other guys."
2,case for what?,"i used this case for several months and quit for all the headache it was giving me. i kept it in my pocket and due to all the (unnecessary) holes in the case, for speaker, data port, and what-ever-the-thing-on-top-does, the case fills with sand and all kinds of bits of stuff. collecting behind the plastic makes screen visibility difficult under most lighting conditions.plus my friends made fun of me for this case :( so i tossed it."
2,really long,I have had issues with A shirts in the past being too short. These are way too long. They bunch up under your clothes because there is so much excess length.
1,Too long!,"Im 6'1 and these shirts go down to my knees, yes i read the other reviews and thought they couldnt be that bad! They are!!!! Do not buy unless u want to wear them as a dress"
1,"feels thin and cheap, way toooo long",So i bought this hoping for a good A-shirt but it turned out too be waayyyy tooo long. Unless your a really tall person dont get these. I got the small size and it reached too my knees.
2,They make great cleaning rags,"Fruit Of The Loom!! I am suprised you would market these undershirts -- they are HORRIBLE! Thin cheap ITCHY ITCHY ITCHY material with a poorly made hem that rips when you put on the under shirt. And yes they are very long but that is irrelevant -- they are horrible, and that about sums up the long or short of it.What a waste of my money. The only thing I can do with them is use them as cleaning rags."
4,A Very Good Undershirt,"Some have complained that these t's are too long. I disagree. They are just the right length. I want a t-shirt that STAYS tucked in, even when bending over (and eliminating the dreaded 'but-crack' exposure!). The cotton makes it very breathable, and wide(r) shoulder straps make it very comfortable. Order a larger size to allow for shrinkage when you wash it."
1,way way way way too long,unnecessarily long. would be better if they were shorter they might actually look nice and can be used for a purpose
1,FRUIT of the LOOM A-SHIRTS RUN VERY SMALL,"I purchased the Fruit of the Loom Men's A-shirts (3 pack of white A-shirts, XLarge)as a Christmas gift for my husband, but they run VERY small. Consequently, they would not fit him. We later purchased locally 2XL of the same A-shirts and they fit great! Unfortunately I could not return the 3 I purchased through Amazon within 30 days (I bought them for my husband in November 2011), and they are sitting here in the package. The other items we purchased, BVD Men's A-Shirt Black/Heather Grey, X-Large, 4 Pack fit him great! We have never had this problem with any purchases from Amazon, and I buy many items from Amazon each year."
2,Really tight and see-through..,"I ordered a small (I usually wear M) but I went with the sizing info here. I have a 32 inch chest but the website stated small was 34-36. It was unbelievably tight. Also, the cotton was not meshed well together. I could see my nipples and boxers through the tank top."
1,too tight,"These shirts are so tight that they almost constrict your breathing. I am a fairly small guy and can wear small or medium t-shirts. I ordered these in a medium and they are much too small. They are also very long, so they need to be tucked in as an undershirt if that's what you're looking for."
1,Too long and skinny,"These under-shirts are too long. I bought a medium size from Walmart store in Princeton, NJ, and couldn't believe their size.I generally wear Large sized shirts, but when I bought large size of Fruit of the Loom, I had to exchange it back for a Medium size. But even medium size was big enough, and I couldn't find a ""Small"" size in the walmart store. Seems like they don't want to have people buying the right size they deserve.Moreover, the cloth is so darn thin and transparent, my whole upper body is almost visible through this thing. Unlike what's shown here in the picture, that it is white in color, it's not true. It's actual color seems to be whatever your body's color is!"
3,gift,I bought this item for my brother he had no complaints. Im sure they were alittle cheaper in stores however
1,These are irregular!,"The undershirts I received were a full 9 inches longer than the medium sized undershirts I bought in the store. The packaging had no warning or description that this batch was extra long. The shirt has the appearance of a dress. This is inexcusable. As such, they are unwearable and I must return them."
3,good quality but unusual length,"As other people have stated,the shirts are very long. Which ultimately is a matter of preference as I would rather they be too long then too short"
1,puhlease!!!!!1,"this software, besides being unusable, once ""opened"" had nothing but tripe inside. awful; you are better off reading 'investor's business daily'"
5,An enlightening book,"Finding Home is the story of the journeys of several people from the Roman Catholic Church to the Episcopal Church. As an Episcopalian, I learned a great deal that I didn't know about Roman Catholicism, most of it extremely positive. There was no R.C. bashing in this book; in fact, the majority of those who made this journey did so with grief at losing the parts of their previous church which had been particularly meaningful to them. This book is well written. I recommend it highly."
4,"Personal, and not offensive","This book was fairly helpful, and as a Roman Catholic(in transition) not very offensive, especially compared to many outlandish works such as Boettner's Roman Catholicism.This book really brings up good points, and while reading it, I several times thought ""Wow, I can really relate to that"" since it is from the perspective of everyday former Roman Catholics.And, Roman Catholicism is not the world's largest religion because it is nessicarily something great. It dominates where it was once the state-enforced religion. You don't find many Englishmen, Swedes, Lutherans, and especially Russians or Muslims flocking to Catholicism.The book is keen to point out that these people were born into Roman Catholicism and taught there was nothing more, and I know that really does keep most Roman Catholics from ever thinking of stepping into a fine place like an Episcopal Church.I'm glad I read the book."
2,"Altogether, rather discouraging","It indeed is interesting that Roman Catholics, taught grave misconceptions about the Anglican Communion, found a ""home"" in the latter in adulthood, and certainly any growth in the spiritual life and church involvement is a happy development to see. Unfortunately, there are several misconceptions about Anglicans which this book seems to underscore!In several cases, the attitudes of those mentioned seemed to be ""I love the liturgy - but don't want the morality or faith of Rome."" Granted - the approach within the Anglican Communion is not based on ""fidelity to a magisterium,"" but this hardly means that the commitment is less. Many of us Anglicans hold moral viewpoints (yes, even on abortion, fornication, and concubinage) which would match those of the most devout Roman, and our attitude towards divorce would be no more carefree than the RC annulment mentality.The book is not dishonest, but certainly is very incomplete."
2,Biblical Arguments Missing,"I purchased this book as I was considering converting from the Roman Catholic Church but after reading this book I changed my mind. The stories are sincere but are often based simply on the persons views of the RC which may or may not be clearly indicative of the Church's real teachings. I was expecting a volume which like - Surprised By Truth Vol 1&2, gave the testimonials of former Protestants who became Catholic after providing detailled biblical reasons for their conversions. Which often entailled giving up lucrative ministries and careers in their former denominations.I learned a few things about the EC but not enough to justify a conversion in good conscience."
1,horrible,I only bought this because my friend's son was in this band. Had no idea of the negativity and swearing in it. I destroyed the CD
1,Very Disappointing!!,"I was so very excited when I saw this dvd was coming out! Screw the BEST of American Idol--I was definitely more interested in the WORST! The terrible auditions are what make American Idol worth watching in the first place!! Unfortunately all we get are heavily edited segments where the singing has been cut out! I have to agree, it seems the producers didnt get the rights to the songs so all we get are the same judge reactions without the guilty pleasure of hearing the contestants sing! I was really angry and upset by this. Some of the most memorable personalities from the auditions have been reduced to nothing more than Simon, Randy, and Paula's critiques. Cmon American Idol! Next time dont fool us into thinking this DVD is going to be something more than it is. Next time I'll stick to my Tivo and enjoy seeing and hearing the real deal on tv!"
2,FOX IS TOO CHEAP TO PAY FOR THE SONGS???,People this is a lame dvd. Sure some of the favorite moments are there but where are the performances? Mary Roach without her singing?!? Just not as funny. It appears that Fox did not want to pay for the rights to include a lot of the songs on this dvd. So it is an emasculated version and hardly worth your time. Nice going Fox!
2,not for big fans of A Idol... you've seen them all,"If you've followed the show and seen most of the episodes then you've seen 95% of the clips on this video and will be disappointed. If not, it's a great way to see the funniest clips from the show. However, since i've watched past seasons i've seen all these people. Good to see them again, but I was excited and hoped to see all new clips which just weren't there."
1,Worst watch ever,"The watch looks good on the first view, but that's all.The bezel is an immovable fake, not a scuba-bezel as imitating. It's just a show-off watch, useless for outdoor.The alarm is difficult to set and the wristband requires special equipment to be adjusted.I've never worn it and scraped it, although it was a present. Didn't sell in on eBay because of bad conscience and afraid of getting bad rating because of selling crap ...Better buy a Timex if you are interested in good value for rather little money."
1,biggest piece of junk,"Biggest piece of junk, I dont get how seiko could release this. While trying to set the time I found out that the hr and min hands wouldnt match up so you couldnt even set it to 12. the flip up magnifier was cool but the compass bezel is junk and isnt a compass at all its just a bezel that moves but u must move it, you might as well just use the watch hands to find out your postion. The good, it looks nice and thats it."
3,Disappointment,"Despite what ADV claims, episodes 25 and 26 did not receive directors cuts. The only episode on this DVD that is a directors cut is episode 24, which smacks of greed on ADV's part since they could have just thrown episode 24 onto the first Director's Cut DVD. Frankly, I'm really disappointed, as I was looking forward to seeing a directors cut version of the TV episodes 25 and 26."
3,A Pure Money Maker,"The show, no matter how great it is, is not changed in any significant way in this DVD. It is just an attempt for ADV to make more money. Only worth the price to find out more information on the upcoming live action NGE movie. Only worth it if you are a true fan."
3,Don't Let This Book be a Stray,"The Stray Dog has a simple lesson, taught through the story of a family finding a scruffy stray dog, Willy. This book is light hearted and kind. It uses colorful and witty illustrations to draw the reader into the true story. If the family would have not helped Willy out he could have ended up at the pound, due to the dog warden. It seems like so many families go through the experience of falling in love with a stray dog, this one happens to have a beautiful ending of Willy finding a home where he belongs. The right family, at the right place, at the right time makes this story beautiful and relatable."
5,Heartwarming Hound Tale,"This heart-warming tale comes with ""blast-from-the-past"" illustrations is squeaky clean and super sweet. A family on a picnic spies an adorable dog. Fearing that he has a searching owner nearby, they leave without the precious pup. A week of concern leaves each family member neglecting responsibilities as they worry over the left-behind mutt. Returning to the park, they arrive just in the nick of time to rescue the pup from a chase with the dog-catcher. Predictable and precious! A tale for every dog-loving parent and child."
5,I love The Stray Dog book,The book is about a dog that doesn't have an owner and kids were on a picnic. They found the dog and played with him until they had to go home. They named him Willy. The kids wanted to take Willy home. They got home and their minds were on Willy all week. On Saturday they went on another picnic and saw Willy. Willy ran past them and didn't stop because the dog catcher was after him. The kids ran up to the dog catcher and the dog catcher said the dog is a stray because he doesn't have a collar or leash. The boy took off his belt and said it was his collar. The girl took off her hair ribbon and said it was his leash. They took Willy home and gave him a bath. Then they introduced him to the neighborhood.It is a good book.
3,Th e Stray Dog,"This was a sweet story about family structure, which is much needed in today's time. Mr Simont demonstrates family values when the family waits to see if the dog has an owner. This book teaches patience to the children in the family.They are anxious to take the dog home but the parents convince them to find out who the dog belongs to. The story shows kindness and caring. The family feeds the dog and watches over him to see if anyone claims him that day.The illustrations depict a plain and simple yet wholesome family life which I think we all can appreciate.Jennifer Dunagan,author of Auntie Jennie's Puppy:The Adventures of Santana andSantana's Harrowing Halloween"
4,Pet Love,"There is nothing more rewarding than to find a family pet, in particular a stray who is in dire need of a home. Thus, Marc Simont has retold an actual account of a family which has done just that, found a scruffy little mutt. In the simplicity of his retelling and illustrations, Mr. Simont has captured the essence of the love for a pet within a family structure. Beware of this heartwarming tale; you may end up at the pound filling out adoption papers! Marc Simont has been involved with children's literature for over sixty years. His accolades include two Caldecott Medals (one an Honor) and the 1997 Illustrator of the Year by the Professional Association of Illustrators."
5,Heartwarming and not at all schmaltzy,"Anyone with a soft spot for animals will love this colorful picture book about a charming stray dog and the family that can't get him off their minds even after they leave him to fend for himself in a park.Of course they go back to the park to look for him, and they find him just in the nick of time. I love the way the quick-thinking boy and girl fashion a collar and leash for the dog out of their own clothing, claiming him as their own before the nasty dogcatcher can nab him. My heart is doing happy little flips just thinking about it!"
5,The Stray Dog,"My children(ages 6,4,2) and I love this book. It has a lovely little story with a very nice message. Any parent or child who loves animals, especially dogs, will love this story. The illustrations are lovely too. Highly recommended for children aged 2-8."
4,Well judged performance.,"This is a nice and enjoyable performance of this great symphony, in general terms.Muti seems to be more mature approaching the 3rd, so we won't find the poor and dullplaying of the 1st nor the noisy and unbalanced 2nd. He delivers a better thought 3rd,with adequate lyricism, balance and beauty of sound. Excepting a fast Finale (Tempo diPolacca) and some problems in sound quality, it is a very good 3rd, but you'll findbetter options in Karajan, Abbado and Järvi."
3,Outsider looking in...,"I read this book for two reasons. The first of which was to open a window into Nicaraguan culture. And the second was to learn some more Spanish.This book helps with both of those objectives. I am not a judge of poetry and can't really offer much on that front, but this collection does allow one to gather a sense of the things that are influencing culture in Nicaragua and that these poets feel are worth commenting on.The passion and raw feelings expressed help to see (for me) the humanity and similarities of people regardless of geography. So, good book for exposure to culture.Great book for helping with Spanish! Poetry in Spanish on one page and the same poem in English on the other. A great self-study."
1,they have the wrong price for this! i can buy a season box cheaper then one dvd!,i really want to get this in febuary near my b-day! an was told that the price was right cause many other sellers have it for this price. but when i looked on ebay it was cheaper for 1-4 and 1-6 and so i wont be getting it on here EVER till the price is right.
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this book along with Link's most recent book ""Magic For Beginners"" due mainly to the high praise that is heaped on these two collections. Sadly (at least with ""Stranger Things Happen"") I'm left feeling dissapointed. The writing is very good but the stories just dont ""do it"" for me. I have yet to read ""Magic"" and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will be as good as the majority of critics seem to think. Before you buy this book (Sranger Things) try and loan a copy first or I do believe there maybe a free downloadable copy from Link's official web site?Instead of buying this I would suggest you try Jeff vandermeer's ""city of saints and madmen"", far more satisfying,a worthy 5 star book."
5,Genius?,"There is a long tradition of short stories in the field of SF. As Arthur C. Clarke said in his introduction to the new book Science Fiction Quotations, ""...the short story is to science fiction what the sonnet is to the epic poem."" Link's stories all have an appropriately poetic feel. Every story creates a sense of wonder and magic. The kinds of stories that will lull the reader, where reading stops and immersion begins."
4,As good as scallion pancakes,"I have to admit that it took me a few stories into the book to get into it, but as they say, patience is its own reward. By the end of the book I was thoroughly enjoying ""The Girl Detective"" while coincidentally enjoying some scallion pancakes with my partner in our favorite Chinese restaurant. I think my favorite story was the one about the Donner party, only because the line about being alive sort of choked me up, and then the quote from the pioneer woman in the story's end, shook me out of it and made me laugh again. This book, like the scallion pancakes, is a real treat."
1,verbal uncertainty,"Reading Kelly Link is a lot like sitting next to a passenger with Alzheimer's who insists on talking to you on a long trip to an unknown destination. Rambling dialogue reaches new heights in this fantasy world. Whether this is done by shuffling word cards or sorting through old post cards from Tasmania is anybody's guess. At first, it's amusing, then it's tedious and you never really get to the point where something has been achieved. If you're a psychiatrist, you'll love it. If you're just a regular sort of reader, you're in for a bumpy night."
1,Simply boring disjointed prose,"Based on all the positive reviews I decided to give this collection a try. The first story was great and I thought that I had discovered an exciting new writer! But boy, was I wrong! The rest of the stories are plain boring, consisting of disjointed prose that either fails to make any sense or is just very uninteresting. Some reviewers compare Link with Jonathan Carroll but while Carroll's stories also tend to the absurd, his prose is always interesting and his characters are so lifelike that they seem to jump off the page!Apparently I am a dissenting voice but Link is clearly an author that is not for me!"
5,Really different,"I read the review of this book on Salon.com and just had to rush out and buy this book. For a book published by an independent press, I was very impressed with the physicality of this book, how it is put together, the cool illustration on the front from ""The Girl Detective."" Kelly Link is really different from just about every modern writer out there. As well, each story in this collection is different from each other. Her style is really diverse, and impossible to really describe fully, but she always takes you in new directions that you wouldn't expect. Some of the stories affected me more than others, but there was not one in the collection that bored me. And for those of you who grew up on Nancy Drew like I did, the last story will really amuse you. If you are sick of all those books now that all seem as if they've been written by a computer or a room full of random monkeys (...), you should definitely check out Kelly Link."
5,wow.,"I was astonished by most of the stories in this book- literal: dropped jaw, that was amazing, how can i become friends with this woman so she can tell me stories at night before I go to bed?Kelly Link manages to weave fairy tales, the paranormal, modern relationships, aliens and other bizzarities (I know that's not a word, but it should be) into some of the freshest, coolest fiction I've read in a long time.If you're looking for unsettling ghost stories, cousins who make themselves disappear, women that travel the underworld Orpheus style with twist on top of twist. This IS the book for you. (Even if you didn't know you were looking for those things.)I'd hate to go into great detail. It would ruin the magic of these incredible stories.If you like Aimee Bender, Stacey Richter, and/or Neil Gaiman during his Sandman days. Read no further, buy this book."
5,Fairy Tales...sort of.,"Though I typically struggle with short story collections (Adam Haslett's ""You Are Not A Stranger Here"" excluded), this grouping is a phenomenal and delightfully surprising read.The stories in Kelly Link's collection really touch on the elements of human life (more specifically--human suffering) and a quirky twist is added to each to take the ideas to a new level. While the ideas are a tad extreme/odd (i.e. man has voluntary amputation to identify with the idea of loss) there is nothing here that should scare off more mainstream readers. Fans of Jonathan Lethem will like this collection.Most notable stories include: Louise's Ghost,Most of My Friends are Two-Thirds Water, and Water Off a Black Dog's Back. Keep an eye on this author for a full length novel. Should Link be able to expand her story-telling to novels, you'll be looking at some seriously popular books.Grab Stanger Things Happen. Definitely worth the cover price."
5,Rare Richard Thompson C.D.,A great concert from a great great performer.... and his now famous son joins him for a couple of songs as well.First rate - love the guy.
2,A big disappointment,Save your money. Buy the Heather Kosar video instead. The scenes were too similar so the video got boring after a few minutes. The video lacks creativity. The triplets made this a 2 otherwise it would have been a 1.
5,Painfully funny. I laughed till it hurt.,"If you ever saw Star Wars and thought ""Han Solo would be much cooler if he were 300+ lbs."" This book is for you. If you ever harbored a desire to shoot up an intergalactic saloon & get paid for it... This book is for you. If you've ever considered resigning from your current job and becoming a disciple of the SlagBlah priests... This book is Definitely for you. Phil Foglio was also co-author of 'Illegal Aliens' and is the illustrator of a whole bunch of those 'Magic the Gathering' cards with his wife Kaja. If you can get it, this graphic novel is well worth it."
5,Noir Detective trips Fantastic,"Buck Godot - Zap Gun for Hire, Vol. 1 has the skeleton of typical detective novel aspiring to Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammet levels, with admixtures of Terry Pratchett and Lewis Carroll to flesh it into something that is too much fun to take seriously, but subtle values touches that come back weeks later to remind us of the imperfections of our world. The hero resembles some folks that I grew up with being, in appearance, overweight, good-natured, and hedonistic in a limited way. He then offers us wish fulfillment by being the durable friend that everyone turns to, who never fails to respond with the exact amount (and no further) of violence that a situation calls for, and imitates a calm serenity despite surrounding surreal chaos. There are hints pointing to future story lines set in a very rich fantasy universe filled with an immense range of possibilities."
2,Should have written it sooner.,"I purchased this book with great expectations having read his work before. However, after a 100 pages or so, I found Arthur constantly using the same examples over and over to prove his points. His book is a feeble attempt to repeat what has already been done so well by another author he quotes as being his inspiration for writing this book. If you want to read a great book with lots of evidence and solid writing, buy the book by the author who believes chariot warfare was the dominant form of warfare before the advent of the foot soldier. I am sorry the title escapes me, but the book is a great read. If you want a good work, don't buy this book, you are liable to have a good nap before you finish it."
1,Chaotic writing,"This is a chaotic book, wonder why it was published. The only positive points I could find are a few illustrations and the high quality paper it was printed on. The text, despite the apparently reasonable chapter division, is a mix-up of themes, the author jumping from one subject to other without regard to any apparent logic. Therefore it lacks depth of analysis, and focus on matters totally irrelevant regarding the books title.The author might be knowledgeable about what he writes (although foot or end notes are absent) but the information is presented in such a chaotic way that it is hardly of any use for a serious student."
1,awful book,"This book is terrible:1) very little information about chariots. Lots of anecdotal info (half the book!) about Chinese (and other) history - interesting but . . .2) just a list of facts - no discussion of the theory of chariot warfare.""chaotic"" is a great word to describe this book. I agree with the above review. Can't fathom why this book was published, or even written."
3,A Good Look at the Beginnings of Warfare.,Like a previous reviewer said the book kinda jumps around and has a tendancy to repeat itself. I found it interesting nontheless in its description of ancient warefare in the Near East and Asia. Its strickly for Historical enthusiasts and Gamers.Many of the subjects in the book would be familiar to those addicted to the old original Microsoft Age of Empires game. It repiqued my interest and I'm replaying the old pre Rise of Rome scenarios.
3,Basic information about book,"Book chronologizes Martin J. Blake, C.M.'s seven month sojourn in Ireland, England, Wales, France and Italy. It is written as a diary of his trip. The book was a limited publishing for private circulation."
4,"These are great, old-fashioned recipes (with a twist)!","If you have some time to spend cooking, this book is for you. For special family-style suppers or lunches with guests, these recipes fill the bill! This book has it all- including menu tips using the side-dish and dessert recipes found in this book. This is probably one of my favorite cookbooks and I refer to it again and again!"
3,Interesting,"It took me a while to get into this book. And it was almost the end of the book before I could remember what the main character's name was. Her name was hardly ever mentioned. Did I like it? That's a tough question. I didn't and I did.The eating disorder thing was annoying - really it seemed like an after thought. And the evil step-mother... was it really that black and white? What father sends his daughter off across the ocean in the middle of the threat of war (if it wasn't obvious why was Aunt Penn off giving peace talks?) to live with relatives she's never even met? I hate it when I just can't buy the premise.But the imagery was good. And the characters, even if not fully developed, were quite likeable. Piper and Daisy's journey home was very interesting. And I really wanted to know what happened to the boys and Aunt Penn. So I did like it."
4,a well-written novel,"Daisy is sent from Manhattan to England to stay with her cousins to get away from her stepmother. Shortly after she arrives her aunt goes away on business, and war breaks out the next day. She and her cousins are forced to leave the house and come to understand how strong their bond really is when they get separated but manage to end up back together. They must protect and help each other in a time when war is everywhere and having no adult supervision suddenly isn't so appealing. This story is a bit disturbing, but also riveting and captivating, and I finished it in one sitting."
2,Not Appropriate for Young Adults,"This was highgly recommended by another adult friend. I wanted to like it. I kept reading it waiting for it to get better. It never did. I feel like I wasted my time - although it's a fairly quick read. Interesting concept of war. However, the plot revolved significantly around underage infatuation and even S*X between underaged cousins. Really? We don't need more of that. And I don't feel like there was a real point to the story. Save your time and also give your kids quality books that fill their mind w/ wholesomeness and not junk."
1,Childish twaddle,"Sadly I purchased this book expecting some sort of Jack Womack-esque, pre-apocalyptic, ""breakdown of society"", fin-de-siecle science fiction. What I got was a book written for 10 year old girls, and written badly at that. This is no Hunger Games. Do not buy this book."
1,What?,"This was such a weird and odd book. I read it a few years ago and to this day, I still am a little enraged by the outcome of it. I felt it was anticlimactic and just weird. I don't recall any specific literary meaning or morals learned in this book and it felt like a waste of time. I looked over some of the reviews and feel like I should give it another go, but I can't bring myself to it because for whatever reason, I am seriously enraged when I see the cover because I hated it so much. When all was said and done I remember saying, ""What? That was so stupid."""
4,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It's the type book that stays with you long after you finish reading it. I wasn't thrilled with the cousin to cousin relationship, but the rest of the book was well-written and thought-provoking. I would recommend it to readers who like a book that lingers in your thoughts well after you've put it back on the shelf."
2,I do not understand the praise for this book.,"I wanted to love this book, I really did. I read the description, I read all the glowing reviews, and I was so looking forward to reading it. Then I started it, and by the end of the first chapter I was bored out of my mind. I finished it out of a sense of obligation but didn't enjoy it at all. The long, rambling sentences were practically unreadable. A male character named Edmond who hung the moon? Twilight, much? I won't even get into the ickiness of the incest.I think this subject matter is intriguing (the war part, not the incest/telepathy crap) but it was very poorly executed in this book. Perhaps I'm just too old to get it."
3,Too much; not enough,"I'd like to enjoy this book, but I am finding too much borrowed information from the past blearing the lines of today.Am I in 1940 or 2007? Eating disorders, incestious relationships, English manors and countrysides, Absentee parents, Terrorists, Cell Phones and Email...and who is the small group capable of killing so many people and disabling a nation?And the Capitals Used In mid-sentence drive me bonkers. Is it emphasis? Am I supposed to be getting it? What the heck is IT? Am I Just An Old Lady now Too Stupid to comprehend today's GENERATION? Is the point that The Past is The Present? See what I MEAN?Well, I'll pass it on to my teen for her Interpretation."
2,Bleh!,"This plot of the book was good. Interesting, in the way the kids go from heaven to hell in a heartbeat. But the fact that Daisy falls in love with her cousin is desturbing. They sneak off and have sex in the barn in the daytime, and in their room at night. And Daisy likes the way he tastes because he smokes. That's just flat-out nasy.The other thing is the run-on sentences because they go on and on forever and take up whole paragraphs and half the time there's only two to three sentences on one page and there's no commas or any punctuation in them unless you count the periods and you end up getting confused and exasperated and distracted from reading because you're wondering when the sentence will end but it never does until the next page and then there's ANOTHER run-on sentence and see how annoying this is?The last thing I have a problem with is the dialogue. There is none. The author only describes what's being said. What happened to SHOW instead of TELL?Hence the ""blech."""
3,How I Live Now review,"There were a lot of really great things about this book. The girl Daisy is very interesting and she has to face a lot of challenges when the war happens in England. She has cool relatives and they get to live independently during the war, and she has amazing adventures. She is pretty funny, too. But there were other things about the book that I thought were too thin soup. How did the war happen? What is up with the psychic powers that people have? What happened really to end the war? I thought that this was a book that could have been a lot longer and it would have been a lot better."
2,"mediocre writing, alright story","I have to say, this was a difficult book to get through. I downloaded onto my kindle and it was riddled with many many many errors. i.e. Strange strings of mid-sentence capitalizations, run on and on and on sentences... etc. Once you got past all the structural technical deterrents, the story wasn't much better, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I think this was due in part with how the story was paced... it ended better then it began and also, in part by the development of the main character... which started out as someone you didn't particularly like or care for to someone you still didn't particularly like or care for but were glad they developed some sort of depth beyond their own subjectivity. There are better books out there, with better stories and better characters..."
3,how I LiVe NOW,"Daisy is a teenage girl who gets sent to live with her aunt and 4 cousins in England. Daisy was sent to England by her horrid mean pregnant stepmother. One of the things that make this woman terrible is that she sends Daisy to a war ridden country. So Daisy goes and lives with her cousins and aunt and ends up falling head over heals in love with one of her cousins and in my opinion that is kind of gross but it ties into the story well. Then, because this is a war ridden country the home they live in becomes war headquarters so the family has to move out and in the movement the family becomes separated. So, because she has no shelter or food source Daisy has to learn to live off the land. With a happily surprising ending to this sad and depressing story you will not be disappointed."
1,"Terrible, worst book I've read","This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all."
1,Maybe I was too young...,"As I read other reviews for this book I got the impression that though this was put in the young adults section, maybe it was aimed for at least the older end of that market because I did not like this book one bit but it seems that some older readers did. When I started it, it seemed to be a fun book, but as I read on I began to like it less and less. The two main things that stuck out to me were the main character falling in love with her cousin which just felt wrong and the main character going on and on about how she hated to eat. I forced myself to finish this book since I was stuck with it on a long car ride, but otherwise I may not have ever finished it. I would not recommend this book though maybe if you are older you could take a try."
5,Great read...fantastic.,This is a great story...hard to put down. I'm not an advocate of censoring children's reading so I don't have a problem with kids reading this. Parents can discuss painful issues with their kids by reading what their kids are reading. I recommend this to kids and adults. Great author.
4,the perfect book to make you think,"From the moment I started this book I was thinking and through out it I came to conclusions. Definately not one of those books you can skip passages in so you can get to the action. The ending, although not a running through the fields sort of happy ending, did end on a positive note.There are a few things in this book that could have been explained: is it set in the future? If so how far? They have cell phones and computers, but they are in a WWII style war.Is this a magical world? It's never really said whether what goes on with Edmond is telepathy or just being really intuitive.But, once you get over these unanswered questions (and you can just decide for yourself since they don't really affect the outcome of the book) it's a great read."
5,A great tutorial on tools and tips for creating video products,"This DVD shows you exactly what tools you need to start creating your own low-cost, high-value DVDs. It's amazing how easy it is to create a simple home video ""studio"" using what Bill covers in this DVD.I use the term ""studio"" loosely because it's really just a few of the right tools setup in the right way. But in the end, you'll be able to create videos that look and sound like professional productions with little effort.Bill makes all of this easy to understand in this DVD and offers you tips on which tools to buy, how to set things up so that creating your videos is easier and how to create a professional looking set using just a few simple tricks and a spare bedroom or office.This DVD along with his other products helped me create my own DVD products so I don't think you can go wrong with this disc if you're looking for a fast way to learn the basic tools needed to create great how-to DVDs."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I used to love the original version so I rented it to watch with my grandkids. It was so revolting that we had to turn it off after 15 minutes. It seems that some [people] got hold of the idea and wanted to make their own version.My wife and I have watched it all the way through several times, and I was completely disgusted each time. It is degenerate filth that you wouldn't want in your house."
3,Semi-Erotic Movie,"Not a bad spoof, only moderately sexy. However, it's obvious at least some of those involved were familiar with all three Buster Crabbe serials."
5,Flesh Gordon,"Very **Adult** parody on the Flash Gordon movie series. Absolutely Hilarious featuring Seka. Great costuming and creative designs, but be advise that this is strictly adult content."
3,PORNO SHALL HAVE A NEW QUEEN TONIGHT!!!!!!,"The fact that this film has the worst acting and script ever doesent slow it down at all from being a masterpiece. A true cult classic and funny comedy at the same time, Flesh Gordon is a fast funny and fleshy film with not so much flesh. Wang is dastardly looking and I also agree with the two smart guys below me that FLESH GORDON himself is the most boring character in the film. FLEXI FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,flesh gordon,"a fun film with lots sex things a spoof for the prudes and religious idiots . a movie to enjoy a freedom choice, for free thinkers to enjoy"
3,some people's children....,"I agree with A customer from Milton, WA United States. But the funniest part is that He and his wife watched it several times and were disgusted every time! What! Did they think it would be different if they kept whatching it????"
4,"Plenty of Flesh, Some Gordon, Great Camp","Purchased VHS of this years ago and couldn't wait for the DVD because I saw some things I definitely wanted a clearer view of. Unfortunately, the video quality of the DVD is no clearer than the tape which is a shame because there are some real knock outs in this flick. It's an entertaining mix of soft porn and a parody of the Saturday Morning Serials from the 40s. My favorite scene is the attack of the killer robots with their power tools. You guys have got to be kidding about who does the best job of acting in this; if they could act they wouldn't be in it. Pondering who does the best job of acting in this flick is like speculating on who's the greatest poet in Alabama. This is advertized as the Collector's Edition which contains 15 minutes of restored video. Wonder what it was like before it was restored. It's a fun movie but they didn't waste any money on quality film."
4,why make giving a review more of a hassle?,"Haven't watched it yet but received the DVD in a in a very prompt fashion. Thanks! Thanks, thanks, thyanks, thanks."
1,Just another softcore porn film,"This film is nothing but a softcore porn film made to a sci-fi theme. Don't let your kids anywhere near this thing. In fact, it's just dumb so I would avoid it as well."
2,Midnight Movie Madness,"Though not for all tastes, the uncut version of this 1974 softcore spoof certainly has its moments. However, the restored footage is not an improvement - resulting in a draggy midsection. The sophomoric hijinks worked better in the original R-rated version. Highlighted by some surprisingly good special effects (even Buster Crabbe was impressed), ""Flesh Gordon"" remains more palatable than the majority of low-budget midnight movies. If a theatrical revival comes your way, see it with a late-night audience."
3,For FLASH GORDON fans - and adults - only,"When I was a teen-ager in the 1970s I used to watch the Buster Crabbe FLASH GORDON short subject films on PBS television. As an adult I saw FLESH GORDON and, knowing what was being parodied, laughed a lot. I wonder why people unfamiliar with the original FLASH GORDON films would want to see it, as they aren't going to get some of the jokes. (Does anyone know why FLESH GORDON has that woman being tickle-tortured, or is there supposed to be a point to it?)"
2,"Hate to say it, but...","I first saw this movie when I was 16 at the drive-in drunk on Boonesfarm. I thought it was hilarious.I've always wanted to see it again, but could never find it. Over the past 18 years I've told everyone they've got to see it.I finally found it at Amazon, so I immediately bought it.I couldn't wait to see it again.Well, I hate to say it, but I should have let it remain a memory. I forced myself to make it 3/4 of the way through, but finally had to turn it off.(And I like wierd stuff). The acting was beyond horrible. The special effects were intended to remain true to original series, but they were actually worse! It was an excellent concept, but the end result was just plain awful. I will give it one more shot. Maybe a little smoke will make it more entertaining."
2,Worth a look,"Only Worth the second stop-motion sequence, when Flesh fights a robot twig. That scene is almost flawless and as good as any Harryhausen animation. The one love scene with Flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice. The film is worth a rent if your curious but it's really just a lame and unfunny movie. If your open to seeing a trashy sci-fi satire of Flash Gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look. Especially fans of stop-motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences."
3,the cult film par excellence,"This is kind of a corny idea: not quite an adult film, but certainly not a kid's film. The script is pretty blah and there are only a couple of laughs. I wish they had taken it more seriously. God, if they had had Mike Myers working on the script it would have been genius. But as I was watching this I saw the opportunity for many jokes that were never pursued.I sure do like the design of some of the buildings and rocket ships, though.One other thing: if you actually take a peek at the original Flash Gordon strips from the 30's, they were practically begging for this, the way they were drawn. Hard to take them seriously after watching this film."
3,"So bad it's good... well, kinda","Flesh Gordon is easily one of the ""best"" worst movies that I've ever seen. If you're openminded and enjoy a good eroti-comedy, then you might enjoy this one. The picture here isn't great and neither is the sound (especially since it's called a collector's edition), but it's okay for what it is. Just don't watch this movie with kids since it contains both male and female full frontal nudity."
3,Flesh,"This movie is like a comic, it is erotic, the female character loses her clothes during the adventures. It has a good screenplay and a touch of humour. The special effects are old but effective. The result is a singular, comical, erotic cult film."
3,Are these people functionally illiterate?,Pay no attention to the comments of the reviewers who dismiss this film as degenerate softcore porn. That's what it was intended to be. How stupid do you have to be to purchase something entitled FLESH Gordon and expect it to be FLASH Gordon? It might also have helped to read the Editorial Review which makes it very clear that this is not a kiddie film. To those reviewers I would recommend purchasing some of the books and tapes in the excellent Hooked on Phonics series.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"First of all I to was enthralled by the mixes, especially the Vission & Lorimer mixes of CAN'T KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU. But this cd was really weak. With the Berman Brothers behind it, one would think it would be like their signature dance style of their previous efforts, Real McCoy, She Moves, etc. Don't waste your time. Get the singles. Hope the follow up is an improvement."
5,"THEY PUTT IT DOWN FOR THE BLACK ''N'' BROWN ENES,ITS FIRME!",I LIKE THIS C.D. AS MUCH AS I LIKED 17REASONS. IT'S ABOUT TIME LATINO ''N'' BLACK CARNALES COME TOGETHER TO SHOW THAT BAY ARE AINT NO JOKE!!!! THEYRE PUTTING IT DOWN FOR NORTE CALIFAS!415 SAN FRAN MISSION!! TU SAVES!!!!
4,Music for Alice,"This book I bought to do a lesson plan on for an ESL class. The book is something I would read to my students if I were studying people's needs in tough times, effects of the war on the Japanese people, or perseverence. The book arrived in a timely manner, and in excellent condition."
5,Very good news about this book,"This is a handbook in how to use Ericksonian hypnosis so it is not easy to read because is a trainig handbook, no a reading for the weekend. I do not recommend to read first the second book on this series(Hypnotherapy 1979)because you will not understand fully simply because they are sequenced. I have translated the 3 books by Dr. Erickson, Dr. Rossi, and Sheila Rossi (she participate in the first book)into the spanish so soon it will be sell in your favourite bookstores in all countries with spanish of Mexico. You can accelerate the publication writing directly to Dr. Jeffrey K. Zeig the President of the Milton H. Erickson in Phoenix, AZ.I am the president of the Milton H. Erickson Institute of San Luis Potosi, S.L.P.,Mexico and I have been teaching clinical hypnosis for more than 30 years so I know the usefulness of this book."
5,Happy,Book showed up in great condition. Was very cheap and arrived in a timely manner. Very happy with it
5,Major history book,"It's always great to find a book that is so detailed about the history of musical theatre. And that's almost everything this gigantic tome has to offer you. Not that it's not good or enough. But it would have been nice to see all the major - i don't know - last Tony winners, for example. Still, it's a really complete book, with lots and lots of great great big pictures, which is always fascinating."
5,FANTASTIC!,This book is great for anyone - from the Broadway musical savant to the average curious person to the theatre student.
5,A Promethean Study of Race,"In two visionary essays on the modern validity of W.E.B. Du Bois' ""The Talented Tenth,"" Professors Gates and West have collaborated on a book that will enlighten anyone interested in race relations in America for years to come. To summarize ""The Future of the Race"" does not do it justice. Suffice it to say that the scholarship of these ""three"" learned men elevates the topic of race to higher ground. If you are looking for an easy read, or easy answers to racial issues, this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you dare to examine your own feelings about racism, I can't think of a better way to begin than by reading this book. I disagree with the reviewer from Chapel Hill who described the book as the ""patter' of ""public intellectuals."" It's too easy to dismiss scholarly works as a product of academia, but thanks to intellectual giants like Du Bois, the essays of Gates and West have been made possible. Thank you, professors."
3,"A ""publishing event,"" not a book","The essays here are fairly good, although anyone familiar with the authors will have heard a lot of the patter before. And the piece by W.E.B. Du Bois--why is that in here? The implicit comparison that Gates and West make of themselves and Dr. Du Bois is absurd. One difference between these men and Du Bois is clear: he never published fluff. Again and again, Du Bois gave us original, groundbreaking scholarship. It has been many years since either of these brilliant gentlemen has offered anything of the kind. But that's the fate of ""public intellectuals,"" apparently--they become more and more public, and less and less intellectual. There is not much here."
4,"more in depth, than most can imagine...","I have not even read the entire book; instead, I've studied it, and boy... Is there ever a lot to 'study'. Now in my freshman year of college, I realize the importance of having blacks becoming more educated, because surely, there is power in education. If you leave yourself open to ask many questions about the book, much can be learned. From the meaning of the title, to interpretations of the cover (on which we've spent more than a week), to what the pictures on the back of the book could represent. These are just a few of many topics that can be spoken about, without even getting inside the cover. If I can ask as many questions as I have about the cover of the book, then surely, reading the book would catch any person's attention."
5,"A strong statement,!!!","I can only quote Amazon editorial reviewer's presentation of this record: ""...insulated, spare and stripped-down. Willfully restrained, raw and uncooked, 'Kill the Vultures' is a masterful exercise in excision and reduction"". It's a perfect description of this music. I can only add that this is a very strong musical statement, something very hard to find these days, particularly in this line of music, hip hop, junk hop, whatever. I absolutely recommend this music to anyone but the faint of heart..."
4,the style it takes,"Having just recieved this record today I've got to sit down and write a few words about it! An insight into the beginnings of a truly great band consisting of the previously released but hard to come by singles ""Lee Remick"" and ""People Say"" and nine other songs, the latter recorded in Roberts bedroom in Brisbane. Though poor in sound quality there is no hiding the warmth and charm in these songs. The Go Betweens were always more about personality than actual musical skills. That is not to say that the playing is bad on the contrary it sounds very tight and fresh but technique was never an issue. Personality and style was. What a rare quality!"
3,Great insight into a great band,"A fabulous relic that's finally seeing the light of day, this release is made up of mostly home recordings made four years before the Go-Betweens recorded their first proper record. While the sound quality is of course a little grainy (it sounds about as good as most bootlegs), and on or two tracks the sound cuts out, the songs shine through the non-existant production value: all of them are clever, gorgeous pop songs. However, the best thing here is the inclusion of the first Go Betweens single, ""Lee Remmick"" and the b-side ""Karen."" These two songs are worth the ten bucks alone."
2,Blown fuse,"Maybe I have bad luck with international power converters. I was using this device in Australia, and it stopped working. After reading other reviews for this product, I immediately suspected a blown fuse. The little plastic door to get to the the fuse was practically impossible to open. After nearly breaking the case to get the stupid thing open, I discovered that yep, it was blown. If you get this unit, I suggest packing extra fuse or two, because you'll have a hard time shopping for obscure electronics in a foreign country!"
5,great,I have owned one of these adapters for almost a year. we live in germany and use it to run our american blu ray player. never have had any problems. maybe some of yall are not looking at the watts before using this. idk. works fine and actually just ordered another one for an american tivo.
1,Didn't work,"I travel internationally several times a year. I bought this Converter because of the price and the product lightweight. At first, I was impressed because it did not sag when I plugged it in, like some of the heavy converters. I used it properly with my electronics and it lasted 1 week, then no longer worked. I am disappointed in the product and had to send it back."
1,bad converter,This was a bad converter. It never worked and left us in a bad position since this was a trip of a lifetime and we couldn't find another converter in any store.
1,Wow. Unplugged it when it started smoking,"I bought this product for travel in South East Asia. Besides all of the negatives that previous people had mentioned, I'd also like to add that it almost caught fire after 6 days of intermittent use. I smelled smoke and looked down and this poorly engineered fire hazard was melting. And all I had was a computer plugged in."
2,They DIED!,"I bought 3 of these to take to Italy and use for printer, cellphone chargers, and PCs. I had read up on transformers and what devices they should be used for. (suggested for PC, small electronic chargers like cellphones, printers, etc.) I was reassured by the manufacturer info that neither the PC nor the MAC really needed the converter, but I decided to be extra cautious. I bought an Italian surge protector (5 openings) and plugged all three of them in. The ones with my printer and MAC were in use most of the time, the third, not much at all. After 5 weeks, the one my MAC was using died. So I plugged the MAC into another. Then IT died too within 24 hours. Now I only have one left--and 10 more months in Italy. Disappointing!"
1,Jensen 50 watts converter,"Got this to make a trip to Germany,first time it was plugged in it blew the fuse and fried my hair dryer.Very disappointed with this product."
1,Terrible Product,"I brought this converter to London with me. First off, it is way too heavy so it sags from the outlet and frequently falls out. In addition the prongs become bent because of the weight. I used this only a few times before it stopped working, not a clue why. When I buy another one I will be purchasing a different brand."
3,"Well, It Worked Until...","I used it for charging my cel and my camera batteries in Israel... until I blew it trying to charge a laptop. PAY ATTENTION TO THE MAXIMUM WATTAGE! Nothing over 50 watts or you'll fry it. It'll overheat, but it won't create a puff of smoke like some of the other products I've been reading about."
1,doesn't do the job,I bought one for a trip to europe. It claims to be rated for up to 50W but it overheated and died while charging a netbook rated at a 40W draw.It did successfully charge a digital camera and an Iphone with no overheating problems.
1,did not work from day 1,The first time I plugged this particular converter into the socket for use - the light illuminated for a few minutes and never again after that. It is totally non functional...
5,Power Pop Lives!,"I am thrilled that Van Duren is still rocking! His partnership with Tommy Hoen is seamless - more like an extension of what I heard in Van Duren's music and intelligent lyrics.Not since the Beatle have I heard such fun melodies and good hooks. And for lyrics to be intelligent and often witty in this day and age is a gift from the gods!MORE, PLEASE!!!!"
5,Attention beatles fans . . .,"If only it were 1965, these guys would be the American Beatles. But it is not 1965, and music like this does not get airplay any more, so you've never heard this CD. If you liked the Fab 4, Badfinger, Emmit Rhodes, and the like, then you must buy this album. There's not a dud on it. It does well what the current musical groups today fail to do: catchy tunes, clever lyrics, infectious harmonies. Van Duren made a great solo album in the 70's (""Are You Serious"") that has remained one of the few vinyl albums I still keep playing. This album is nearly as good, with the only minor quibble that there aren't enough ballads (notable exception, ""Full Moon, Empty Heart""). The rest are great uptempo pop tunes that will burn themselves into your brain. I have never written a music review before, but this CD screams for an audience. Give it a listen."
5,A Great Book,"When I started reading this book, I thought I was going to be reading boring material. I was WRONG. Mr. John gives specific details and gives factual and unbiased opinions. This would be a great book for researching about Nazis in America."
3,1939 Nazi Spy Threat,"Written in 1939, right before WWII. He is advancing arguments and examples for German Nazi infiltration of the US, Mexico and other places in the western hemisphere. He certainly has an interesting writing style, and he keeps the book moving.At this distance in time, figuring out what is true and what is not would be a great deal of work, and is not of sufficient interest to me to address."
4,Mediocre,"The only problem I've had with this mp3 player is that it won't sync with my computer. I can't load songs directly from my personal laptop, but can at my dell at work. This is a little annoying, but I guess after you get the songs on there's not much you need a computer for.All over this has run pretty well. It's nice to have a bigger screen and I didn't have any problems actually getting the music/pictures on. It's a little annoying that you can't charge it directly from an outlet, but I'm so happy it doesn't run on batteries."
4,Great low cost option,Love this MP3 player. For the cost it is one of the best MP3 players I have used. I have never had a problem downloading songs and the sound quality is great for what I use it for.
4,Sansa the Great,i love my Sansa.It has a nice screen.It has great features.VideoMusicradiovoice recordingIt even records radio.I owne a sansa of my own. I thought it was going to break the first day i got it because i accidently dropped it in the pool. Sansa is so good it didnt break even after dropping it in the pool. I left it out a day to dry and it worked again. Thats how good sansa is.
3,Player froze after a few days,This player is freezing after a few days. Will send it back since it appears to be defective.
4,Sansa MP3 player,"It's a cheap but well working MP3 player. It could use a little better instruction booklet, though."
1,Designed to Anger Audiobook/Podcast Listeners,"If you use your MP3 player for music only, my one-star review is very harsh. For the money, it is a decent player if you never listen to anything over five minutes long. However, if you listen to audiobooks or podcasts, do not buy this player. I have used about a dozen different players over the past few years and I have never ever seen one so ill suited for playing lengthy files. There is no bookmarking feature and the fast forward is so slow that it is completely useless. You cannot start and the end of a track and rewind back to your spot either. Worse yet, it seems like the designers almost were determined to make it impossible for someone to maintain their spot on a long track. The record button has a hair trigger and is very difficult not to accidentally touch, and you had better manage to listen to that audiobook on one battery charge, because recharging will also cause you to loose your spot."
4,Great for the price!!!,"I just received this MP3 player today and I must admit that I love it. The screen is bigger than the iPod Nano's and it is very bright. It was very easy to upload songs using Windows Media Player's sync function. My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll wheel should be a lot easier to press. They could have made the buttons wider or lowered the height of the scroll wheel. Also, the ear buds could be better. I will probably look for some replacements soon. Overall, I love it. And for the price, it's hard to beat."
4,This MP3 Player Is More Like A 4.5 Then Just A 4!,"Pro's.....1. Good for the price.2. FM radio.3. Great sound with most headphones including the ones that come with it.4. Bright.5. Good batterie.6. Pictures look nice.7. Organize for you. (Songs buy genre, album, etc.)8. Shows some album covers while playing songs.9. Recording voice.10. I guess thats it. L.O.L.11. Oh yea, CAN ADD MORE MEMORY! (That made up my decison!)What Suck's.....1. Video is the worst I have seen in my whole 15 years of life. L.O.L.2. While recording the FM radio it plays it back fast.3. No AM radio. (Yes people still listen to it.) L.O.L.4. Can only charge with usb.5. Sometime freezes. (Rare!)6. A little bit thick.7. Smudges.8. Sometimes does not play a song and you would have to put it back on the MP3 player. (Rare)9. Headphones sometimes get uncontable.10. I guess thats it!"
1,sansa e250,"I am very happy with sound quality, ease of use and memory. It has two glaring faults: one is that the pause button will pause, but when you resume you go back to the begining of the track and the other is that you cannot scroll through the track with fast forward or the command under songs. Since I bought this to listen to audio books those two features are key. I have to listen to whe whole hour of text or start at the beginning next time. To add to that customer service is useless at solving the problem. For these reasons I will never buy Sansa again nor would I recommend it to anyone"
1,Better have a lot of patience,"Despite all the raving reviews, our SanDisk turned out to be nothing but frustrating. Songs did not download properly, and playing them back was often impossible to do. Also: READ THE SMALL PRINT ON THE RHAPSODY CONTRACT - UNLIMITED FREE DOWNLOADS ARE ONLY FREE IF YOU KEEP THEM ON THE COMPUTER, AS SOON AS YOU TRANSFER THEM, YOU WILL BE CHARGED, EVEN THOUGH YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION WILL NOT STATE THIS."
4,Great Product ----Good IPOD alternative,"Bought one a month ago as a gift. Good product....sound was good and play mpeg 4 too. The only thing i don't like about is the Sansa don't offer enough language selection like japanese, korean, chinese and etc..... other than that all are perfect. It has more feature than Ipod Nano with lower price."
5,nice alternative to iPod,"very good alternative to iPod if u don't want to pay the extra bucks for iPod. Provides other features like radio, voice recording and pictures too.If you compare sound quality of Sansa with iPod, you will feel that iPod's quality is couple of notch better but I would avoid to pay huge extra bucks to gain on that quality."
2,player not detected by pc??,"after installing the software and connecting the player via USB to the pc, it shows connected in its screen and it also charges. But when opening either Windows Media Player 10.0 or Sansa Media Converter to transfer music or pictures, it keeps saying ""device not detected"" (WMP) and ""no available player, please connect your player"" (SMC). I did not find anything in the manual to solve this. Maybe it is just a silly detail or maybe something is working wrong."
5,very good,i like my sandisk 2 gb mp3 player. i havent got the time to put and try the videos section but i did get to watch the demo that they put in the mp3 player and i like it alot. i love the photos part. its very easy to use and i just like it alot.
3,Eh,It is an ok player but it freezes constantly. Sometimes it just doesn't have any data and the crenn doesn't show up sometimes. All in all it is alright but i would opt for an alternate player.
2,I loved it....until it stopped working correctly.,"Ok, I bought this thing a bit more than 2 weeks ago....and for about 1 week, it worked just great (see ""positive"" reviews). Then, I wasn't able to add anymore songs to it. It loaded up into the player thru the computer and showed up in the drive when plugged in but didnt show up on the songs/albums list. Its like the song disappeared or was hidden somewhere.So I took it back to the Best Buy where I bought it and the nice clerk told me that she ALWAYS saw this player returned (out of all the mp3 players). She kindly told me this after I told her I wanted to exchange it for the same player. I took her advice and took store credit cus I didnt think she'd lie for no reason.SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! They may have some kinks to work out. I suggest either buying something else now and trying some later models of this. Sandisk may have rushed this to get it out into stores."
3,VERY GOOD BUT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,I BOUGHT MY SANDISK ABUOT 4 DAYS AGO...I LOVED IT THE PICTURE IS AMAZING ON THE VIDEOS AND THE MUSIC IS GREAT...BUT I TOOK IT OFF HOLD AND TURNED IT ON AND IT JUST FROZE...THE BLUE LIGHT FOR TURNING IS STUCK ON AND FROZE COMPLETELY...IDK Y THIS HAPPENED BUT ITS ODD...
1,Stinks!,"I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my teenage daughter. While not an iPod, it was more affordable & seemed to offer the same features. What a mistake. It never really worked well from the beginning. It kept loosing music. the video portion never worked fluidly. Then, one day I called tech support & they gave me tips on reprogramming it. We did & the screen went rainbow. My daughter never used it, went back to her old fashioned use the batteries mp3 player. Leaving it alone, a cat walked on it broke the screen & it's the biggest waste of over $100 I have EVER made. Sandisk sucks! @least this Sandisk product does."
1,Not so good,"We purchased this for our son for Christmas. It worked until we put music on it, then the screen died. We are now in the process of getting it exchanged, but through Sandisk.I will never buy another electronic item from Amazon again. All of the electronic items we have purchased have been bad."
2,It break in between ..the wheel light is on,At times the wheel blue light is on and it never goes off. The screen turns blank. You wait for battery to drain and then turn it on. You have to keep waiting for a day for player to work if ur stuck up in such a situation. I'm returning mine as it has happned twice. Dont want to take changes till it crashes completly. Seems the s/w has some bugs yet.
4,Good alternative,"I consider my purchase of a sansa e250 with satisfaction. It has had a few niggles, but it has proved to be a fairly solid player.+sound is quite good+easy interface with windows media player+attractive menu/screen+easy to use scroll wheel+good battery life-screen gets scratched easily-buttons sometimes hard to push and cheap-looking-software issues (Had it crash twice during the 2.5 months I've had it. No big deal, wait until battery runs out, recharge it and it works fine)"
3,Useful but frustrating,"We bought two. The support documentation out of the box was poor at best. What documentation was given refered to a CD that was not included with either. (Much more useful information is available at the company website.)One player was returned to Amazon as defective; the screen went black and would not respond to any command.For the player that we kept, my contact with the company's tech support late on a Sunday afternoon was very helpful and resolved a vexing problem."
4,Sansa e250,"Excellent MP3 player. It is small, light, durable and has great features. The sound is excellent. I really like the wheel for manuevering around through the player. I also like that you can view the album art. It isn't a neccessary feature but nice. I purchased the DLO Action jacket also which protects that player without adding any weight and it also has a handy clip to attach the player to whatever! You won't be dissappointed... especially with the price!"
2,"Works, but a lot of problems","Seems to be a well constructed item, however, a lot of the time it can't seem to load the selection for 3 or 4 minutes. Menu is simple to use, but there's no real shortcuts to hitting the button and waiting for it to make up its mind. I've only got it about half filled with downloads from Napster. Screen and front scratch VERY easily. ""Earbuds"" aren't confortable at all. They're simple small speakers with a thin foam pad on them.Would I buy another one or recommend it - not if there was another option."
4,Not quite an iPod killer,"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. This is a good solid MP3 player. I also agree with the two major complaints. The buttons and wheel are pretty flimsy and hard to use. The buttons are even worse once you add a case with a lip around them. I also find it silly that you can't charge and listen at the same time. Maybe they'll have a fix in the firmware for that at some point. The Sansa has two features that almost make up for it, and are the reasons I purchased it.1. The battery can be replaced with a $20 kit. Something about the iPod ""send it back"" model just doesn't work for me.2. The expandable memory with SD cards was the other big selling point. This basically makes the capacity unlimited."
4,I like it too.,"I have had this mp3 player for 3 years, and I still like it. I have never had any problems with it and it does everything I need it to do.I bought the case for it and use it when working out or cleaning the house. It still looks as goos as it did when I got it.I would recomend it as a great alternative to an Ipod."
1,don't waste your time or money,I used this for about 3 months before it died. never dropped it and always kept the battery charged but it froze up and then wont do anything. I even waited a month before trying again and it turns on but then freezes. Buy something else
4,great product,"this is a good mp3, shipped very fast. I like the look of it, its very small and light-weight. So far I am happy with my choice. But it came with 20 preloaded songs and a demo video that seem to take up some memory and I havent figured out how to delete them. I used windows media player to download songs, and its was quick and easy!"
4,Great for talking books,"I purchased the MP3 player to be able to download talking books from our library system here in Alaska. I am on my second novel now. This is great for walks. I could care less for downloading rap, rock, country western or wall music. I will download come classical music if I can find any. Tha battery has great life and doesn't take long to charge from the USB port."
3,whats going on!,"i got this sandisk as my first mp3 ever in december,at chritmas. it worked beautifully when i got it,till about march. then,suddenly,it stopped taking songs or charging. i then bought another charger, which stopped working within a few days. i was annoyed and surprized. when the battery ran out it just shut off(because it couldnt be charged) and now it dosnt work. NEVER AGAIN. i'm sticking to the ipod now."
2,WARNING: microSD Card expansion often not useable,"I received version 1 of this product. There are two modes for use: MTP and MSC. MTP is REQUIRED for use with Windows Media Player 10+ and other software, but when the player is in MTP mode the microSD card expansion slot is UNUSABLE. This has been confirmed by Sansa technical support."
4,Great little MP3 player,This mp3 player is a steal for the money. I needed one to take on motorcycle trips and backpacking excursions. This one worked out real well. It is fairly stout and can withstand some bumps and abuse. I got a rubber cover for it which helps protect it. I was also happy with the free software for converting video content for uploading onto it. Get it at the Sansa website. I keep my pictures and some video to share with people who I meet and I can get most of my music on there too. Volume is adequate but could be better at the cost of battery life which is also just adequate. I carry an extra charged battery on backpacking trips and can change out the dead one in a minute with a tiny screwdriver or knife blade. Radio is good but can be directionally sensitive. Voice record works great. I recommend this item.
2,Audio problems and substandard electronics,"This mp3 player has many different features which can be useful, however, its drawbacks are rather problematic. First of all, the volume level cannot reach high enough, for those who like to listen to music at a relatively high audible level, or if the audio file is recorded at a low volume level and you need compensation. Second, the sound quality does not offer good bass sound and the stereophonic quality sound it offers is really not high quality. Third, the buttons often jam because of the fragile construction, or in other cases the circuitry jams if various different buttons are pressed too rapidly in succession because the corresponding electronic systems are poorly designed. Also, the memory size can be problematic. I would say every mp3 should offer at least 4 GB of memory."
4,A great player,"I've bought 2 of these. Its a great player, the FM tuner is nice to have. Sometimes have a bit of trouble with the software, could be a bit more user friendly, but otherwise I definitely recommend this player."
4,"A very good product, and at a great price through Amazon.com","This is an excellent product and I've used it to completely replace my 60-cd player, and then some, since its 2Gigs can hold far many more tunes than 60.My only negative is the lack of the associated cd that contains certain useful software; it wasn't included in the purchased package and I believe it does come with the new product."
4,Nice for music,"Great for music. Wish it had 'bookmarking' for downloaded E-Library books, but it will save your spot if you pause it before turning off."
4,SanDisk Sansa mp3,"Love the mp3. Only problem was figuring how to add music onto it. It did not come with instructions or software, but once I figured that out it was great. I like it better and so far have had fewer problems than Ipod."
1,Not Impressed with this MP3 player,"I have bought a lot of mp3 players in my life but this one suxs the most. It has a great appearance, even great features but all that doesn't do any good if I can't hear the music i put on it. I am a very active person, either by running, playing basketball, or working out I use my mp3 player. There is only two choices to adjust the volume and the highest one is still like a whisper. It doesn't work with my fm transmitter also. So i my personal opinion, I would not buy this one because now I have to buy another one and haven't had this one a month yet"
4,Pretty Good for the $$$$,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, because he wanted something he could watch videos on and listen to music on at work...I have to say I was pretty impressed with it..up to the point where you are locating video's to download. I was not familiar with that process, and it seems to take a while to do it..most likely thats my ancient computer. He is very happy with it..good buy for what I paid!"
3,ok!!! Customer,"I ordered a SanDisk MP3 Player,at first we cannot make any changes it got stocked,I was about to return it,but my daughter somehow made it to work...I rate it OK or 3 stars mixed feeling for a new item that did not work at first and then now it is working."
4,"First one was defective, but....","The first e250 I purchased from Amazon was defective. The output jack wasn't secure and the slightest movement would cause the sound to crackle and cut out. Confirmed it was the e250 and not the earbuds by testing with a known good earbud set.Amazon replaced the defective unit with no hassles (5 stars to Amazon.com and their customer service).The new one works as it should. It's simple to use, holds a lot of files (especially with the expansion slot) and is an all around good performer.The only downside I can think of (beyond the first defective unit) is the blue scroll ring. It's stiff and doesn't turn too well-could be better designed. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 stars. Overall I'm very pleased with the unit and would recommend it."
2,Not What I Needed,"I was disappointed in this product. I attend day long meetings several times a year and wanted a device that would record a series of sessions. The device only records in two hour or so increments. Additionally the battery ran out after several hours. So for short recordings, it works okay. But if you need it to record additional information, be sure to get the car charger (or find an outlet) so that you can record all day. Lastly, it was not that easy to figure out how to use. The instructions that came with the device were minimal. It took awhile, but I finally figure out how to use by trial and error."
2,mp3 player,I like the player but am very disappointed that there is no way to increase the volume. It is very hard to hear the music when running outside
4,my christmas gift to myself,"I love this thing, radio is not very strong, but it plays well. downloaded music right away, even with my 2000 computer. I have yet to figure out how to remove items download. Does what I need."
3,Sansa E250 Player,"I would rate this MP3 player higher if it wasn't for the software I use to play and download my music. Rhapsody needs to get their act together or folks will go somewhere else for a good quality MP3 player. Nice compact size, nice graphics, and the sound quality is excellent. I got a very good value from Amazon.com and was able to purchase one for me and one for my wife. The thumbwheel is intuitive and very easy to use, and the blue blacklight makes it very cool. I guess when I become a MP3holic I will upgrade to mthe 8MB player but only if Rhapsody does better in their software and support."
1,"Sansa MP3 Player , Poor Quality",This is now the third Sansa player that has died in a very short time.... very disappointed as it was a present for my son. I won;t be buying anymore Sansa...
3,For music only,"It has been 2 years since i got this, and it's pretty durable. Doesn't play ANY of my WMA files, so I had to copy those songs onto a CD, and then put it back on the computer, rename the songs, and finally put it on the player. Very annoying. It also can't hold basically any video, so dont even think about putting any movies on!"
1,DOA,Mine was dead within 5 minute of being attached to the computer after charging. The screen turned blue and the seller wanted to have it checked. I just wanted a refund. Not another product who which should have been checked when it was mailed to me.It was purchased for a kid who did not need a big multi gig for xmas.I would not accept this player free if reconditioned and DOA.It could be a good product I'll never know as it's not heavy enough to use as a paper weight.Remember never not buy electronics from a barn.Miatab
4,Sansa review,"I enjoy using it very much. Was difficult to follow instructions for me. My grandson (17) did it better, but even then it took him a while. I downloaded several discs to it and have a difficult time initially finding where it is and how to get it. Needs to be more ""elder"" friendly. Once I am up and running it is great, even with the small earpiececs.I am enjoying it."
4,SanDisk e250 2GB mp3 - great product,"This is my first mp3 player. I researched mp3 players for a couple hours, reading the reviews and looking at the features. This one has the best bang for the buck.It's not that expensive, has a screen, radio tuner, and has picture/video capability. I haven't tested the video yet, but the pictures are very clear to be on such a small screen.Overall I'm very pleased. The only negative thing I can think of is that sometimes after dragging and dropping songs to the device, the songs just disappear and it has to be done a 2nd time.If I had to do it over again, I'd buy again."
5,Why pay big bucks for an Ipod ?,This thing is amazing! It will do any thing you would expect from an Ipod. Great tech support. Had to call for a minor issue that could have been avoided if I had read the booklet.We can use the same mini SD card that we have in our camera phones if we need more memory.Got it for $0.00 Highly recommend it!
3,good while it lasted,I bought my sansa in november used for about a month everything was great and it hooked up to my rhapsody account easily the only problems i had in the first month were a little bit of freezing but i was able to reset that every time until a little while ago i tried to start it and it wouldnt go to the menu also the headphones broke pretty easily I contacted tech support they said they were going to send a firmware update but i dont think that will fix so i will either get a new one or get a creative i would say get a creative i had another one a while back and it was great
5,Truly enjoy it!,Thi is my 2nd SanDisk Sansa. I bought it for my husband because he liked mine. We both have been pleased. My first one I have had for a year and it works great. Very easy to use.
4,Great Product,"My son loves the sansa e250 player, the only issue was that he wasn't a big fan of the earphones it came with and replaced them with much better ones. In all, it was a good buy for both my son and i cause i saved a few bucks. ill recommend the product to anyone."
1,Junk that falls apart,"This thing is junk. The big button on the front falls off all the time, and I finally lost it. I contacted them, but they don't sell the button. You have to buy a broken one on ebay and salvage the button. No problem finding those, but they go for a premium because everybody needs salvage players to fix theirs too. I didn't want to buy an ipod because they are so trendy, but now I look them with the perspective that no moveable parts means less stuff that can break."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who can't stand iPods. He loved it, but the first day of use, the sound started cutting out randomly. He tried different headphones with no luck, so we exchanged it. Second one worked for a little over a month before the same problem started up again, then it started making whining noises in his ear. We returned it and are going to buy a Creative. It's really too bad as the features of this mp3 player are perfect (except that the battery life is REALLY short) and the price is great. But I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"Good for the kids, not suitable for audiobooks","The kids wanted MP3 players for Christmas and I instantly fell in love with Sandisk's e200 series players (Santa delivered 3 of them). I thought I'd borrow one of them from the kids and switch from being a ""books on tape"" to a ""books on MP3"" listener. Wrong.Like so many other MP3 players, these are missing 2 important software features: variable-speed/high gain fast-forward & reverse, and bookmarking. Without these the unit is worthless for trying to listen to an hours-long audio book. Without bookmarking, you'll frequently find yourself inadvertently reset at the beginning of the book. And its 5X fast-forward would take 2 hours of button-holding just to get back to the end of a 10-hour book.Each of these features is a fairly trivial bit of software/firmware. And Sandisk has wisely built into the e200 series the ability to update the firmware. For now I'll hold out hope that Sandisk will retrofit these features into their firmware."
2,Ok MP3 Player.,"I bought my Sansa 2 GB at Radioshack and 2 weeks later it went into an incredibly little interface crash and has been irresponsive ever since, the player does not want to work at all and the 14 day return policy expired (before you buy please check if there is any return policy) Other than that enjoy the little life it has. Its a very good mp3, i loved the earbuds!"
1,Spend the money and buy an iPod,I bought this little MP3 player and returned it when it messed up my computer. I bought an iPod Nano and now I'm happy
4,It's Fair for the Price,"I gave 3.5 stars, because it's good for the price. I'm using this device mainly for running, it fell twice and still working. The LCD is great; I believe is better than the Nano. However, I `m sure you want to read the negatives. I don't like the noise it makes every time change songs, the bulky thumbwheel and/or the smalls bottoms which I need to stop from time to time to change artist or songs while I am running. Other than that it is a good product for the price and for my purpose. Se los recomiendo. Gracias"
1,Terrible Firmware Quality,"Cons:1. Unit freezes, requiring hard reset every so often.2. After a album ends, it does not play the next album.3. Play all plays songs by alphabetical order of their titles. This makes it useless for audio books.4. No Eastern languages support.Pros:1. Decent audio quality. Some buzzing is heard, but not too noticable.2. Decent battery life."
4,"beautiful unit, but....","this is a real nice unit. great features, but here are a few that bugged me. the recording button can be pressed by accident much too easily. it has an equalizer, but not a customizable one. the battery is rechargable & replacable. but not like the c & e-models. they use a AAA. just pop in a new one & you're good to go. plus, you can only recharge via usb. not that convenient if you ask me. the display is top notch. really nice. displays time, pic of the album, battery life, time of song played & time expired. also, it has a slot for mini sd cards for expandable memory. really nice feature there. but if you have a really LARGE library, i suggest something with large memory capacity like a creative zen. i've seen high as 30GB but be prepared to spend. good luck."
3,Sansa e250,"In general, the device works well, the sound quality is good, and I'm generally pleased.But, it does have some negatives:1. The most significant issue is the computer software interface is very, very poor. It is difficult to use, hard to manage the sound library on either the computer or device, and downright clumsy. This is a significant negative.2. The earphones are tolerable, but uncomfortable. How much could it cost to upgrade them?3. While it has radio, it does not receive am.4. I purchased the case offered through amazon. To say it was cheesy would be a compliment."
1,Disapointed,"I was really impressed when I first received this player. In fact I loved it! However, the first the first time I actually took it to the gym for a workout, I was showing a friend how I had this cool video of my Grandson to take with me wherever I go, and while showing her, the video froze and the picture just started fading away till it was gone. That was the end. It was totally unresponsive from then on. It's a gamble purchasing this item. I noticed others had the same problem so I didn't get a replacement."
1,"Beware, Never worked. Nice piece of garbage.","After reading all the reviews, I decided to take the risk and order this player in the 2 Gb version (e250).The player was nice in outside, I get to my house open the box, charged the player and.... nothing happened.The player started and after the San Disk Logo, it went into a black screen. I follow all the instructions on the FAQ in the San Disk web site, and in the instruction book in the included CD.After reseting the player it alternates between a black screen and a stripped one. The player never worked.I packed everything and will send it back to Amazon. I will ask for a refund and I will buy an iPod from my local retailer.It's a shame, it was a nice player"
1,Sansa e250,This is the worst made pruduct of its type I have ever purchased.The screen cracked becuse it fell the distance of aproxamatly 6-8 inches(from the arm rest to the cup holder) and the manufactuer would not let me send it back for repair or replacement and it was only 32 days old. I have a family of six and have many mp3 players and none of them have been built so poorly. Never have i had such poor customer service with any other related product. I would not recomend this to anybody that would actuly use it outside their home with any consistancy.
4,SDMX4-2048-A70 Sansa e250 2 GB,Nice user controls. Great screen clarity. Be careful with the screen. I would consider leaving on the plastic coating that comes with the device or buying a cover to protect it.
5,Beats iPod nano,"Awesome gadget. Packed with features, considering how small it is. Very sleek design. And oh so tiny! Memory expansion is great! Beats iPod nano for the same memory capacity! The only thing iPod is good at is putting high price tags. People need more than just play media ...e250's screen is small but very sharp. If only the bundled media converter also converts iTunes m4p that would be terrific.Thisis an awesome product! Worth the price, so much much more.The only thing apple is good at is putting a high price on their gadgets."
1,Fragile TRASH!,I would have liked this better if:1. This thing didn't stop working on me.2. I dropped this thing one good time while walking and I lost the middle button to it.I'm done with this brand.
2,Doesn't work after a month.,I bought this as a gift to my friend. She only used it a month and it stopped working. :-/
2,"Good, when it works","Only had it for a few months, and already having issues with it. Seems to have an issue with just about any pair of headphones I try using with it. Great when it works, but its too much trouble to get it to that point once it goes sour."
3,Ok Sansa Player,"Was very pleased at the beginning with mp3 player. Easy to use and loved having my songs out & about with me! However, over time it seems to make some of my songs ""bad tracks"", this is even with having re-formatted the player (which is a real pain). Still seems ok, but probably would buy a different brand after this."
4,Great MP3 Player,"I love this mp3 player. It is easy to use and has alot of memory even without using the SD expansion slot. I have about 200 songs on it, which has only used about half of the memory. The radio works pretty good even without the cord being used as an antenna. The battery is pretty good also - it lasts through several of my study sessions for medical school. The only thing that totally annoys me at times is the case. This is because since the case just slips over the mp3 player, it gradually slips off when walking or running if the player is loose. However, since it is really good about protecting the player from scratches & it does stay on when it is in my bag, I'll live with the case."
5,Excellent player,"This is a great mp3 player. I was going to get an ipod nano, but i saw this one, for 129.99 at circuit city I got a 4gb and it's awesome. i have 233 songs, music videos, and pictures. and if i ever need more memory i can get a memory card. the video quality is great, and the screen is twice as big as the nano's. love it!"
5,easy to learn and affordable,"The Sansa was easy to figure out..and I like easy. The 2GB is just perfect for use in the gym or just about anywhere. I think I loaded 360 songs the first time I tried. Size is great and the arm band is a must for working out. Excellent sound quality. Price is more than reasonable and I did find them on sale for less than I originally paid. I had originally purchased an iPOD and for the added exprnse it was too difficult to learn, and I didn't have the freedom of using my own CD's. With the Sansa I choose the music and weather or not I wish to pay for it. No special sites deal with unless I want too. Sansa is very good...I would recommend it for every one from 10 year old Jimmy to Grandma.."
4,Great for the Money!!!!,I really like my new mp3 player. It is very easy to load music and what I like most about it is that you're not just stuck to one computer for loading music and you don't necessarily need SanDisk software to add music. I use media player.
3,Complicated contraption,"I bought his item for my son for Christmas and it nearly ruined mine. It was very complicated to get songs downloaded and then it downloaded every song we had. Now to delete you must hook it back up to the computer. It would be much easier to use a CD burner and a compact disk player. Plus, the instructions to use it are online so if you have a problem with it you have to go online to find the answer. It was a huge PAIN!!!"
2,Not for audio books,"If you want to listen to audio books, the software on this player is terrible. I've had it for a year and use it occasionally when there are no other options (CD player, casette player, or laptop). I really dislike it and customer support says they have no intention of improving the software."
4,Very equiped,"This MP3 player looks nice, also is very equiped for a good price. It has voice recorder, memory slot, FM turner, among others. The wheel is a little unconfortable."
3,Good MP3,Good mp3 works well but cant get video to work so if any of you know how i can get it to work that would be great advice to have....
4,Nice MP3 player for those on a budget!,"This Sansa MP3 player is a nice, rugged piece at a great price!Pros: Solid metal case feels substantial, long battery life, nice screen size, cool blue backlight, plays videos, lots of accessories available, great volumeCons: Controls difficult to use for someone with big hands/fingers, no ac charger included(charger included works off of PC USB port)All in all, this is a very nice Ipod-like MP3 player. Make sure you buy a case and AC charger with it!"
4,"Good musci player to buy, great alternative to IPOD","I have bought 3 of these for my fmaily and friends. I have one for myself too, no problems with nay of them. I personally think this is a good alternative to the IPOD for people who are not crazily into videos and everything else the IPOD offers. The player works well, has good functions and the headphones are good too."
5,Nice alternative to the Nano,"Love this MP3. Had it for a couple years now and its worked fantastically on vacations, runs, all-nighters, etc. Holds battery well, though no outlet charger. However it's a durable machine--dropped it on more than one occasion on less-than-soft surfaces and its always bounced back. PROS: sleek, cheap(er), durable, easy to sync and arrange music, AM/FM radio, voice recorder CONS: no outlet charger, hard to find accessories, buttons hard to use at times, picture and video not worth it. Final say: reliable and economical with a extra features that if anything will work if you're especially bored or need a radio/recorder in a jif. Would recommend it."
3,"Problems, but decent","The e250 functions well as an mp3 player, bit has PC connectivity problems.The screen needs an overlay or a case; it scratches easily. The included headphones are uncomfortable.The PC charged, but did not recognize, the device the 2nd time I plugged it in. The expansion slot holds a micro SD, so I used the chip to swap out tunes... until the blue ring of death. (That's what the help blogs call it.)I sent Sansa an Email & they responded within 24 hrs. When the hold switch is on, the record button is a reset. The e250 will connect if plugged in while the record button is held. This sounds easy, but an extra hand to hold the USB helps if you use a hub. The firmware must then be reloaded.Great! It worked for a month. Now sometimes (1 in 10) my XP computer recognizes it or at least knows I've plugged something in. my vista PC & the iMac can only charge it.The m250 came with better headphones, a clear action jacket and armband and no connectivity problems. (My Mom loves it)"
4,Rugged little players,I have gotten two of these for my kids. They are feel more rugged and solid than IPODS and are cheep. Controls are not as easy and smooth as IPOD's but for small kids they are great.
4,Love it !!,"I love it !! I was able to purchase a 4 meg upgrade and now have 6 GB for all my music. I have been confused by it ( transferring playlists from my PC ),but after reading the manual it (duh) worked out. the only thing I would change is making the plugin module internal and having the device treat all memory as contiguous. Sound is great (but then I'm older and went to a lot of live concerts when I was younger, and was always close to the speakers <grin>) and works for me and all my favorite 60's and early 70's music. Yeah !! Right F%^*^%% on !!!"
4,A good little MP3 player...I bought 3!,"Here is what I like about the SanDisk Sansa e250:It is nice lookingThe scroll button is a great featureIt is easy to navigateIf you shut it down it starts up where you left offIt is just the right size for me, not too big or smallIt seems sturdyHere is what I don't like:Although it has a category called ""photos"" it does not accept JPEG or BMP formats. I have yet to try various other formats.You have to delete songs on the MP3 player from your computerAll in all I am quite pleased with it."
4,kewl,good sound... easy to put songs on.. but if ur get the blue screen its pretty easy fix.. just take the screws out in the back.. take out the battery and put it back.. and its fixed... no biggie.. anyways... im enjoying this booger.. :) its nice to have! have a good one!
3,SanDisk,"The first one that I recieved, the battery wasn't no good. It was not getting a good charge. But once I email Amazon and told them the problem, they got right on it and send me another one out. Now that is better."
4,Nice Unit,Got this unit for Christmas. Works well. I like the two ways you can load music. You can treat it just like a mass storage device or use the automated upload. I'd give it five stars but one of the ear phone pads fell off the first day. In contacting SanDisk I was informed that the ear phones are accessories and are not covered in the warranty.
4,Great for the price,"Not a bad little player for those out there who are unwilling to join the nerd herd iPod bandwagon. The price is outstanding and the pros outway the cons.ProsDrag and drop any music file and it playsAM/FM receiver works fineGreat pricecompact/lightweight=great for runningGreat little screenConsSpin wheel takes some getting used toVideo and pics are only transferable after converting them to some weird format. software included (one more thing to install on my computer)Only recharges when plugged into computer so i have to make sure i have one with me whenever i am away from home for any lengthy trip.All in all, i really like the player. what can i say, I hate Apple's insistence of buying songs from iTumes that won't play on anything but an iPod. Down with DRM. This player accomadates my music gathered over the years from different places and is a great little music player, especially for the price."
4,Sans MP3 player is nice unit,Have enjoyed the MP3 player so far. It is easy to use and download music and pictures to.
5,Functional and Easy to Use,"My son insist that the IPOD and all of its derivatives are the best. I strongly disagree. This mp3 has all that I need, including an integrated radio. I can use it for all of my subscription services and the download process is effortless. I highly recommend it."
4,Good for the money,I've had a few mp3 players but wanted one with at least 2 gb. I searched for a long time and read a lot of reviews before deciding on the sansa e250. Amazon had the best price. It's compact and has great sound quality. It does not come with good instructions but playing with it teaches you fairly quickly. The bonus is that it also has fm radio. Great selling point.
1,Buyers Beware!,RCA does not stand behind is product! I bought an MP3 that they admit is DEFFECTIVE but they will charge me $62 for a replacement when I paid $59 for it at a local store! And no there products are NOT Vista compatible. They don't have any other alternative drivers or software for vista at this point. But I found a way around that to find out that the Mp3 player itself is deffective. Spent an hour on the phone with customer service and she told me I should send it back but I would have to pay more to replace it than I paid for it new! There customer service also informed me I wasn't the only one with these problems! STAY AWAY FROM RCA!!!! I had a similar thing happen some years ago with an rca VCR!
3,Sansa e250 and Samsung T9 compared,"I purchased this mp3 player and Samsung T9 2Gb at the same time. This was for my wife and T9 for me. After using both I think T9 is much better product for about $[...] more.T9 is better because1. T9 has 30hrs battery life2. Brighter display3. Buttons are easy to touch (one who used this will know what I'm talking about)4. Menu navigation I found more intuitive5. Thinner6. LighterGood part about sansa that it has a micro SD expansion slot, which is missing in T9, even though I'm not sure how often people use it."
4,Really LOVE IT!!!,This mp3 player is great! I think it is better than the I-pod! I am giving it 4 stars only because you cannot purchase a wall adapter to charge it. Beware when charging with a laptop ---it doesnt charge as well.I think MP3 players are one of the best inventions ever! And a lot more durable than CDs. I will be purchasing one soon for my 7-year old.
4,Great MP3 player...,"This is a great sounding player... and I like the features and screen. The memory size is a bit small... but, I don't think that I need more, having the ability to remove playlists and add new music. The expandable memory is a big plus. I can add more memory at anytime.Some things that I wish this player had or was different. The headphones sound good but, are VERY uncomfortable. A user configurable EQ would be a nice addition to an already great player. Removing music from the player wasn't easy to do at first... you have to show hidden files and folders on your pc if you want to take off the songs that are preloaded.It looks sleek and is not too small in your hand. I purchased this going on reviews I got from several reputable sources and have to say, so far, I am completely pleased. Picture resolution is really good for the size of the screen."
3,sandisk sansa e250,"Great product, arrived on time. I was a little dissapointed to find out that I could not transfer recorded TV programs onto it. I have a panasonic mp3 that is similar and does allow me to transfer Tv programs."
3,Could be more Linux friendly,"This is a nice unit, although the controls are clumsy. The play, pause, forward, and back buttons are over a ridge outside the navigation ring instead of under the ring.The device and the flash card (when installed) are recognized in Linux and are easily loaded from Amarok and Konqueror.It's too bad that this device does not recognize ogg vorbis and flac formatted files.This player is easily a superior value over the ipod."
5,Great MP3 player at an affordable price,"I bought the Sansa e250 after reading many positive reviews here on Amazon. I was looking for a simple PC compatible MP3 player that didn't require a lot of software on my computer. The e250 is very simple to operate and easy to load with music, photos, and video shorts (I haven't yet figured out if I can load a full length movie, not to mention if there's enough memeory for that anyway).I was pleased with the Sansa, so I've bought a MicroSD card (another 2 GB of memory), car and home chargers, and a protective cover set. All here on Amazon, and all very affordable.So if you want a quality MP3 player without the fancy name and pricetag, buy any of the Sansa ""e"" series (pick the amount of memory you want)."
4,I would love IT even more if...,"I could find accessories for it. I love it because it comes with a FM tuner, a recorder and the expansion slot. I just wish there were more places to buy ""made for Sansa"" in my area."
4,Pretty Good Product,"Holds a lot of songs, battery isn't the greatest. Really small and lightweight. Easy to travel with. Overall good sound quality."
4,"Great player, for a lot less than an iPod","Bought this for my young daughter, but also used by my wife when she is working out at the gym. We just needed a small mp3 player with a nice interface. We have lots of mp3's and wma's, and no aac's. So we didn't need an iPod. This player works well, is small, light and easy to use. Granted, it doesn't have the touch controls like the iPod, but what it does have works well."
1,nothing but problems,"It keeps freezing up and now this time after trying to do a update on it, it is frozen up and won't clear up. I have taken the battery out for the night and this morning it is still stuck on ""database refresh"". Can't seem to get a good solution for this on going problem either. This has been going on for about a year now, but this time it has had it I guess and is ready for the trash. I would search other places for product review besides amazon before buying, because there is a whole lot of other people out there having the same problems with this and the other 200 series as well and customer service is poor. I will never spend money on a SanDisk product again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The product looks very nice, however the performance level is extremely unsatisfactory. I have had nothing but problems since I purchased this product. I continuosly get error messages (synchronize) I have been unable to use this product for a full 48 hours(((((VERY UNSATIFIED CUSTOMER))))))"
3,2GB MP3 Player,"This is my 2nd Sansa MP3 player and was a gift for my dad. The quality, once everything is done is fantastic. It seems easy to get around and play what you want, volume, sound quality - all great. However, the initial set up overshadows this greatness. It wouldn't work with my Mom's laptop because it didn't have a 2.0 USB port. My 1 year old computer had difficulty recognizing that the player was plugged in. And I had to contact SanDisk to find out how to remove the songs that the player initially came with. It all seemed quite awkward and hard to navigate. Again - I say, once it was done, it's been terrific. But very frustrating getting to that point."
4,First MP3 Player and satisfied,"I got this MP3 for my birthday and am impressed. There are some flaws in it though. First, the Rhapsody is an ordeal. I had a username and forgot it with my password. I could email them to get my new username and password but I didn't get it. I tried this multiple times. Also transporting pictures is also hard. It says when I have the Sansa connected, I have the pictures. One other minus is that the earphones sometimes become uncomfortable and fall off. Good things about it is that the FM Radio is good but sometimes has bad reception. Ripping and then synching CD's is easy. But I cannot sych the songs I have on my Playlists from Windows Media Player 11 unless they are from a CD. I have not yet put on any videos on it as I am not sure how to do it. I would recommend this because of the price and the capabilities of it. Just remember to write your username and password somewher safe:)."
2,so so quality,"I have this model for almost a year. I expected to us eit for video play or image slide play. But I just can't get it right for most of occasion. Now I almost foot I still have this e250 until I saw the page from here so I think I need to share part of my experience.I don't sign up for any online music service. Only use media player to transfer music from my library and collection. For many times I have difficult to transfer the right songs to right location in this e250. I feel there are many bugs issues in this model. So I gave up and go get ipod to get the better life. For sound quality I may give it 3 stars but for ease of use I will give it 1 star. The conclusion, the quality at sound can't even compare with the digital voice recorder ""OLYMPUS ws-300m"". How sad!!"
4,A Really-Good Purchase!,BUT!? the iON-BATTERY BURNT-OUT ? = WHEN WE PLUGGED INTO THE SANSA-USB/AC-ADAPTER-TO CHARGE ? OTHER-THAN present-occurence; THIS IS AN EVOLVED-SANSA :-)THANKS FOR ASKING
1,Not the best device,"Not a happy camper - although I liked previous Sansa MP3 Players, which is why I bought this one, along with it's replaceable battery, this device seems to have NO on/off switch, only the option to set the automatic off time feature, wasting valuable battery power. It came with NO cd, only a link to the Sansa website to download the connecting information, except the website does not list this model ????"
2,its kind of good,its a nice mp3 but it has several problems. it does this thing about after a year were it says bad track and you cant listen to it any more. also the middle button does come of easily and you have to select the song above the song you want to play that song.
2,Don't buy for Recording,"I purchased both the Sansa Fuze and Clip... to record lecture broadcast on FM station. While technically they can record, they both make a continuous clicking sound that is recorded as well. Can't believe Sansa does not acknowledge the problem."
3,junk,"The player turns on by itself without you even touching it, I have worked around this problem by keeping the ""HOLD"" switch on when its not in use. The seller offered to send me a new one but all my music is already on this one and I have worked around the problem so I declined.It sounds good othewise."
3,"Great design, easy to work, bad software.","The player is really easy to work, with personal playlist function, which is really usefull, more features even than iPod. The problem is: the player freezes when you turn on, probably half of the times. The first time I turned on, new from the box, it froze, and you have to press and hold on/off bottom for 12 seconds and try to turn it on again. This solution always works, but it seems the player just won't turn on someday. It's frustrating."
2,It does not recover from a crash easily.,"I was perfectly happy with this product when I first got it. The sound is acceptable and the interface simple. I was never very excited about the wheel controller because it does stick an awful lot.The main problem with this product is that it is very sensitive and can crash easily. If you do not disconnect from your computer in exactly the right way, it gets very upset and will crash. Once it does crash, it does not recover well. I have spent two days reformating, deleting everything, trying again and getting more frustrated.I cannot honestly say that this product is otherwise so special that it is worth putting up with this frustration."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent buy. Especially for for your young teens. Can do everything the ipod nano can do. Easy to navigate and upload music and videos. Even has a fm dial.......
3,title,"the players seemed cool, however, it seems that the quality is not all that good, my first player kept die on me... however, the second one seems to be working well."
4,Ipod,"This is a great Ipod, easy to use, great price, great sound plus it has a radio Apple doesnt have that. Luv itIt did crash 2 weeks after I first got it but contacted the company and after i shipped it 3 days later I had a new one. Great response time."
3,Looks Great. Waiting for replacement,"Looks great, worked great, for the first 3 weeks. All of a sudden it freezes up. I cannot get it to stop cycling through the Sandisk title screen, over, and over.... I tried the reset, about a million times. Let it drain then tried agian. Nothing. Thank Heavens for Amazon's return policy as I am returning this and requesting a replacement. I am willing to give it one more try. This time the first thing I will do is update the firmware as I did not do that before it got stuck in start up mode. Funny thing is I bought two of these. One for my son and one for my wife. They were half the price of the Nano and they wanted other things for Christmas. My daughter just wanted a Nano, so I got her the Nano. She is laughing at us while listening to her Nano and we have problems with this Sansa."
1,Cannot play normal mp3s,I bought this product and it got to my house today. I opened it up and I found out that this product like way to many of the current mp3/ media players cannot play normal mp3s. what I mean by normal mp3s is an mp3 gotten by putting the data from a cd on to your computer. The only mp3s that it can support is ones that have the special permition encoding like ones bought online. This product did not even deserve the star I gave it. If you have a library of mp3s that is all bought online then this is the mp3 player for you.
1,"Good Product, Poor Support","This mp3 player works great, BUT! I purchased two of these units for my daughters. They work great and hold more music than an average person could listen to in a month. The problem is that Sansa offers no accessories for them. You can't get a car or wall adapter to charge the unit. There are NO cases available that will fit properly. The plugs on Sansa products are NOT the same as Sony's, so don't waste your money trying. If you are not constantly near a computer with a USB port, you cannot recharge the battery. Because my daughters carry them in their purse and no cases are available, they get all scratched up. Until Sansa gets their act together, I would not buy any of their products. I even called them, whereas I was told accessories would be out by Christmas (2006). Here it is April of '07 and still no accessories. Most stores are now refusing to even carry this product. Bad, Very Bad company support."
3,Good Deal,"Good deal. I had purchased as a gift for my young son.2 gigs is plenty for him. Haven't figured out how to get ""factory""pictures to erase on it yet.Also, not crazy about the fact that they inscribed ""refurb"" into back case. Have an 8 gig refurb bought from different supplier that is not marked refurb."
4,nice player for the price,"This is old news. I'm sure there are new models now, but I bought this for my wife last Christmas. She loves it. I wish it had a slot for an SD card for added memory, but other than that it's great."
3,"Almost good, but not quite","[...].The player is reasonably small - smaller than an iPod nano, but not as small as other mp3 players. The screen is pretty good, and easy to read. The battery is easy to replace. All pluses.The downsides....the 'click wheel' feels very cheap, and liable to break at any moment. The other problem, getting the player configured with rhapsody.com. After 4 hours of trying I gave up and took the player back to the shop. I bought a Creative Zen vplus instead. A MUCH better buy. Its smaller, far more robust, and connected to rhapsody on the first attempt.Bottom line, the Sansa e250 is ok, but there are much better players out there for the same price."
2,use at your own risk,"i bought it because it was cheap for like $100 but I dislike how it glitches and freezes, then I'd have to pull out the battery with screws to restart it. It's difficult to use with just one hand, and the integration of software for it is not so good and very frustrating x_x to use. It doesn't support unicode languages either, so no chinese/japanese/korean etc on the US model. Think carefully before you buy this."
5,My Sansa e250 Review,"This MP3 player has lived up to all my expectations. I haven't used the micro SD slot yet. I've just synched songs from my PC and played them on my MP3 player. I've done most of my battery charging while hooked up to the computer although I also purchased the extra Macally SN-A411 USB AC Charger. I should use the charger while on vacation. Later, I bought an arm holder that I put the MP3 player in and use while working out. The MP3 player is held steady this way. That's the main reason I bought an MP3 player. So far, I've used it while working out and while working on the lawn. Amazon's price was the best I found and when I later found the same unit in a store, it was more than $20 more expensive at the store. Delivery was as estimated by Amazon. The only disadvantage I've seen is most optional equipment is made for Ipods but for the price difference I'm not concerned. I think Amazon or SanDisk is the place I could find such equipment made for my unit."
4,Good product,"Product is everything it was said to be. Haven't played with it alot, but so far it seems user friendly."
1,VERY BUGGY!,"When mine works, I really like it but most of the time I get random ""Bad Track"" messages and songs that don't work. And once in a while, I'll finish a listening session and all my songs are fine. Then I turn the device on later that day to listen to more music but most or all of my songs say ""Unknown"" for the title. I cannot figure out what causes the device to do this but I do know that it causes me to get pissed. Good luck getting video on it because I can't get mine to take ANY video. But in the devices favor, it has a nice bright screen, easy user interface, and good battery life. I just wish it wasn't so buggy so I could listen to music easily! Don't listen to people who say it's not loud enough because that all depends on your earbuds/headphones. I have some Philips earbuds that are so loud, I can only turn the volume up to one. But overall, just don't buy this, get a Creative or something."
4,Not very loud.,"It is a pretty good player. And for what is on the market in this price range it is one of the best buys.But, if you plan to listen to it while cutting grass you will have to have it turned up all the way (my old Rio Nitrus was way louder). Maybe the ear buds it comes with make it louder, but I like my old sony wrap-arounds.And, I am not a fan of the bottons, they are stiff, probably so they don't get pushed while in pockets, but I don't like the feel of them or the toggle ring.The battery life has been very good so far.The voice recorder works pretty well."
3,FM radio barely works,"I'm not sure if this was a defect or if they're all like this, but the FM radio on mine hardly worked at all, it could barely pick up even strong stations. Since this was one of the main reasons I bought it I returned it.Not a bad player overall but:- menus are a bit hard to navigate- not much tactile feedback on center button, hard to use- bulky compared to nano, more so than I thought- it seemed solid enough, especially the scratch resistant back, but not as nicely made and not nearly as slick as ipodsCenter wheel works fine, blue illumination looks cool, screen is OK for menus, marginal for photos and videos. Sound quality seems about the same as ipods which is fair but not great.Since radio doesn't work anyhow, I'd pay the $30 more and get a nano."
1,Only worked for 2 months,"This was a good little player, and I would have given a much better review if it hadn't died on us, twice. The first one lasted 2 weeks and wouldn't charge or power on anymore so we sent it back. This one did the same thing 2 months later, and they won't take it back because it has been too long. watch out!"
1,Freezing Video,"Music plays fine on the unit, but I purchased this for my 5 year old son so he can watch videos while his big brother uses the tv. I downloaded the Sansa media convertor and did everything as stated. The videos all froze up after only a few seconds of playing. To get the player working again it had to be shut down and rebooted. Again, the video froze.I'm trying an 8gb Sony Walkman now and see how it can handle videos."
2,Defective Item,Within 1 to 2 days of receiving item started to have problems with it not staying on or going off on it's own. However Amazon's customer service was excellent and told me to return the item and a replacement would be sent. Not only was the replacement sent before I even returned the item but the return shipping was free.
4,A good option,"Sansa player looks quite robust and durable. The screen is brighter and is quite easy to use, the interface intend to be iPod like. However, compared with iPod, the sansa player feels a little bit coarse.The goods:. Price. Memory expansion. Easy software to uploads videos. File system do not scramble your mp3 files and folders (just read them however you upload to it). It comes with a small but useful case (to avoid scratchs). You could record directly from the microphone. You could record the radio. SizeThe bads (that is because I didn't put 5 stars). The volume wheel is completely mechanic, then your thumb works out spinning the wheel.. Software to upload mp3 does not have as many features as the iTunes has. The interface could be better. Headphones could be betterSansa e250 is a QUITE good mp3 player. It's a good opponent to the ipod nano if you don't have enough money to buy one of those."
3,Some things left behind,"I just purchased one e250 and really the device itself is good looking and solid buit. The earphones sound very well too, with good bass response.But also I figured out that some things were left behind:1- It won't work on anything else other than a computer running Windows XP. I myself use a W2K machine, so I have to borrow a computer to transfer the songs. You also can't use it as a USB flash drive because it won't work on any computer.2- The file formats it deals with is very limited: MP3, BMP and .MOV Quicktime movies. To watch movies you need to convert them all with the supplied software. The software only works with the device attached to the computer, so it also doesn't work on my computer also.3- There is no arm strap or case for the earphones. That's something that really misses on a portable device.4- It does not support accents on the name of the musics. It will show accented characters as a square."
3,Good but could be Better,"I just received mine today.Complaints so far...- Only chargeable by USB cable, does not charge when PC is in sleep mode.- While USB is connected the device is inoperable.- I've already had to reset my device once, it hung up on me.- The buttons are really tricky with the silicone skin on.Compliments so far...- The price- The screen is very nice- user serviceable battery(take that iPod).**************FOLLOW UP -Returning my unit. 1. The screen keeps going out and have to reset unit to bring back display. 2. While using in car noticed a thump noise in between songs - not very pleasant. Also the buttons are hard enough to get at, but damn tricky with the silicon skin on.Hate to say it but may give in to the darkside and go with the iPod."
4,My husband loves it,I would have rated it 5 stars but I am an Ipod lover. I bought this for my husband to use when we workout at the gym. He loves it. He has put all his CD's on it. He even walks around the house listening to his music. The only problem we have is we can not figure out how to make a playlist. He uses the artist or albums list instead and he doesn't really care that much that there are no playlist on it. He did purchase new headphones because the ones that came with it were too large for him. I think he is ready to get the microSD disk for it so he can put even more music on it.
4,A winner!,"I just purchased this for my son's birthday and he loves it. Well he loves the sleek design, features etc. However he is having a bit of difficulty loading his music on. We thought it would come with a cd especially for the pictures feature. When he figures it out...he's feverishly working on it, I know HE will come back and give the other star. In the mean time if there is any one who can aid him along we'd appreciate it!"
4,Good cost/benefit ratio,"Have had the mp3 for about 10 months now. I don't write reviews of things I have not used enough.Overall I think the product it's pretty decent, but this is what I liked the most / least about it:PRO's:-Lot's of functions for the price-Battery lasts longer than I expected (I listen mostly to talk radio, not songs)-Once you figure out, it's pretty easy to copy/paste the files you like in the unit- Recorder and radio feature are kind of OK for a multi-task unit, but don't expect marvel reception or flawless recordingCON's:- Software is awful, they could have done something simpler- Sandisk, keep the headphones and give customers a cheaper product. They are worthless.- Sometimes it's hard to find the file you want if titles are very long- I recommend the protector. My 3 yr old daughter cracked the screen the first time she touched the thing.-It would be nice to be able to charge the unit not connected to a computer, or at least be able to play it while it's charging"
4,Great alternative to IPOD,"Bought two, one for each of my daughters, at about the same price as one IPOD with the same features. Easy to use, nice physical format. I think they are a great value when compared to alternatives."
3,Great Product,"This unit is great, mp3, video, FM radio, the only drawback is the limited 2 gigs of memory, which can easily be resolved through its mini-SD expansion slot"
5,great player,"Yes this was a gift for my daughter for xmas, I was very surprized how easy it was to set up and navigate without even having to look at the manual. It has very good sound quality and the screen was easy to see. The only drawback was wished it came with an audio converter software not just video conversion software. Overall and excellent player."
4,Very good product! It rocks iPod for less money.,"Good quality and just the right product, as expected. One disadvantage is all about the buttons around the roll keys, because they are too small and sometimes is very difficult to press if you have huge fingers."
2,"Gr8 innovation, poor product","BUYER BEWARE!!I loved the idea of putting so much data on the Sansa e250. I didn't love it freezing up on me almost immediately.When I was looking for an MP3 player that can hold a lot of music it was a bonus to be able to add photos BUT!!! It froze up on me almost instantly and wasn't easy getting it to function properly. My husband and I worked on the Sansa for over 3 hours to get it to work. Once we got it loaded it froze and wouldn't turn on/off. Seriously disappointed.I learned my lesson after this purchase - ALWAYS READ REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY! After pouting and stomping we did read others' reviews and found so many others had the same problems.We bought ourselves and our 2 kids Sansa ""m"" series Mp3 players and thought we'd have the same fortunate luck with this model - NOPE!Great design - poor functionality."
2,Works great the first week,"When I purchased this product,I was looking for an MP3 that was compatible with Rapsody to go. I bought one for me and three others for my sons and my husband. However all of our Sansa's stopped working sooner than later. Mine was the longest lived and it lasted about three months. My sons' and husband's MP3s all died within a month or two.If you are looking for an MP3 player that is compatible with Rapsody, I would try the zen. That was my next MP3 and it is still working well. My husband got the Sansa clip and he has had that for a few months too. The clip is also great for workouts."
3,Not as strong as Almost Innocent,"Sheila Bosworth has an incredible gift for evoking the sentiments and atmosphere of the deep south. I absolutely loved Almost Innocent which I believe was her first novel. I could not wait to dig into Slo Poison and I did enjoy it. However at times I felt it to be stylistcally overdone. There are passages that sound forced and the dialogue and reminiscences don't flow as naturally as they did in the first book, That said it is still a fine novel by a very talented writer."
1,I am so disappointed,"I am really disappointed with this product and I bought four :(When i got it in the box, all the liquid which is some sort of ink was leaking, I initially bought them as gifts for my co-workers, now i am stuck with them (makes no sense returning because i live outside the USA and to return will cost too much)I tried cleaning them up but everytime you touch this the ink gets on your hands..be warned this product is just a big mess!!!"
3,It's ok,I got this for a gag gift and that is what it pretty much was. It would have been okay if you could even read what it said haha. All in all it was just okay. Nothing I would buy again and I used to love that Magic 8 Ball
3,Amusing gag gift,"I bought this for my husband as a gag gift to put into his stocking. He loves unusual, funny , stupid gifts and this was no exception. Although this one was on the lower scale of his preferences it was still enjoyed. For those who enjoy a little sarcasm with their coffee, this is an ideal gift."
4,fun toy,Fun toy. Carried it in to office cubicle. Co-workers love to stop by and ask it silly questions.
2,Very Disappointing,"It is very difficult to be able to read the captions. The piece that has the captions on it seems to float too low in the liquid, so it is very hard to be able to read. Tilting it repeatedly seems to eventually work, but after that effort, the intended humor is gone. I don't know if it is related to that issue, but I have only been able to get ~3 different responses to ever come up. I suspect that the weight of the floating piece is too heavy, and not equally balanced. It was intended to be a gift, but I ended up not giving it, since it wasn't fun to use, since it was so hard to read. Part of the packing inserts were missing, so I suspect I got one that had been returned - probably since it didn't work well."
2,Not really what I expected,I was hoping for something a little more edgy. This was too politically correct for my crowd. I'll pass it on....
3,It was something cheap,"To add to the collection of 8 ball, affirmation ball and etc at the office... If you need something goofy at your desk It's worth the $5, but nothing special."
4,"Cute, but all of the answers are ""no"" answers","A fun & silly gift. I just wish it had some sarcastic ""yes"" answers. The only answers it has are all in the negative, like ""yeah, right"", ""get a clue"", and ""in your dreams"". Still works fine for what I'm going to use it for."
3,Why does everything seem so cheaply made these days?,Besides the ball being made of cheap plastic (is there such a thing?) It seems the answers in the original 8 ball are more sarcastic than these.
1,Warning - dangerous toy - leaks ink!,"This is a cute toy, but after sitting on a bureau for a while, I picked it up and noticed it was stuck to the bureau. It leaked it's blue ink, damaging the bureau permanently and creating a mess. This is a dangerous toy for children and should be taken off the market."
1,"Would be fine, if it worked.","I ordered the Sarcastic Ball as a little joke to go with my gypsy/fortune teller Halloween costume. I had a magic 8 ball when I was a kid, so I figured this would be the same, only sarcastic, right? You would think so, but no, apparently not. The liquid inside the ball is sludgy. It's too thick for the message die inside the ball to rotate and come to the surface. In the ball I received, the message never came completely up to the surface of the window, and the liquid is so dark, that it has to be on the window or you can't read it. So, after 10 minutes of shaking the ball and hoping it would begin to get better, I gave up. It's being returned. Also, as a side note, the construction was crappy. The ball has a seam around the middle that was assembled badly and had some glue reside on it. It was just very cheaply and poorly made."
2,Shipping Issue,"I read a review about how one of these balls had arrived broken. I just thought that it might have been a fluke... So I ordered the 8 Ball for a friend here in Iraq. I got a message from them today telling that they had the same problem and that they had blue water all over them. I am not sure, but it seems to me like the manufacturer may need to improve on the design of this ball."
1,Save your money,I bought this for the company Christmas gift exchange. It looked like it might be a cool gag gift. When I received it I was so disappointed I ended up buying something else and threw this one out. The comments displayed by the ball are very hard to read. I cannot recommend this to anyone. Save your money.
1,Does not work! Do not buy!,"I thought this would be a fun item for Christmas with the family, but to our great disappointment, we were not able to read any messages in the ball even using a flashlight. It is such a rip-off! I should have read the reviews before purchasing one myself."
1,SARCASTIC BALL,"Sarcastic Ball was received in non-working condition!!!Due to apparent customer demand, a replacement was not available from seller.How good is it? Who knows!"
2,Not what I thought,"This is a ""must be shaken"" item in order to ""play"" I thought it was a ball that is sqeezed and a recorded saying randomly is said. It is hard to read the words, the window is too dark."
5,Accoutrement Sarcastic Ball,"This has been a lot of fun to play with. My nieces and nephew got a kick out of playing with it. I've taken it to the office and we've had fun ""consulting"" it for questions. Has provided some good stress relieving laughs."
4,Cool,"Cute idea and funny answers to questions asked. the only issue I had was that some of the answers are illegible so you have to ask again . . . . but that's okay - for the price, can't beat the entertainment value . . ."
2,Sarcastic Ball,The words are too hard to read and don't seem to come up flat enough to the clear bottom to see. The answers are too general and not funny enough for most adults. It could be improved - I'm not happy with it.
2,Hard to see,"The people who make these fun balls must not have an R&D department, if they did they would see how hard it is to see the letters. Very frustrating."
4,Crystal ball from the past,My daughter loved the Majic 8 ball so I thought my son in law would enjoy the sarcastic ball and I was right. I even enjoyed it. Just remember it is a toy and you will have lots of laughs.
1,Misleading title,"The title should have been ""Everything you ever wanted to know about memory, except how to improve it"". A 1-star rating is too good for this book, but there wasn't a ""no star"" option to pick from."
2,Ignore the Title,This book is not what the title sugests. It does not contain how to's on learning faster and remembering more. It is a summary of other's scholarship on how the brain works. That's it.
2,MISLEADING,"When I bought the book I thought I would be doing practice after practice, making my mind stronger and my memory better. What I did not expect was 1/3 of the book to be written about the developement of a child's brain, and another 1/3 of the book to be about problems with the brain when people get older, much older. Being neither child nor elder, that only left 1/3 of the book pertaining to me. Unfortunately most of that part of the book talked about how the brain works. In the end feel dumber and more forgetfull... My final evaluation would be... what was I talking about?"
3,"Great DVD, but annoying techno glitch","If you like American Idol, you will love this DVD, especially if you were not tuned in to the early seasons. You get the highlights without being dragged through the debacles, and there is a minimum of filler. There is a manufacturing glitch in the current version however, which makes 3 out of 4 of the season reviews (I'm guessing about 25% of the content) unwatchable. A replacement disk had the same problem, and on different DVD players. The good news is that Amazon.com was fantastic in their response (replacement and eventual refund)."
2,DVDs are defective!,"My daughter is an American Idol fanatic, so I ordered her this DVD for Christmas. The DVD I received wouldn't play anything past the ""Season Reviews."" Amazon.com sent me a replacement DVD, which had the same problem. So I sent the replacement DVD back to Amazon.com. I don't think it would be worth trying to get yet another replacement.."
3,Bad Disks Again?,I got this DVD as a gift for my husband as we both enjoyed the show so much. The first DVD I got wouldnt let me view anything from the season reviews on. I figured it was just a bad disk and got a replacement DVD. Same problem. I was really happy with the content overall up to this point with the DVD. I think they picked some great performances and it was nice to see all 4 seasons on 1 disk. I'm not sure that its worth getting a second replacement DVD.
1,Not the best,"Being a very big fan of american idol and watching the show since the first season, I was excited to see they had a video out with thebest of American Idol. Well, this was definately not the very best. The clips of the performances are short. There's more talking than anything else. Save your money and watch channel 11 American Idol Rewind."
2,"American Idol, Best of","The ""extras"" portion of this video would not play. It was returned for another which was also defective. The main program was OK."
5,Synopsis?,"This item is not released yet, so I don't know whether it is good or not (although I am really looking forward to it), but can someone do something about the Plot Synopsis?This is some stuff that doesn't make sense.1 - American Idol is not really a ""Star Search' clone, but ok I can live with that one.2 - People do not have to use AT&T; wireless cell phones too vote, that option was introduced during the second season for text message voting.3 - The judges are not a part of the voting, and do not decide who goes home4 - The prize is not a recording contract AND a million dollars, it is a one million dollar recording contract. two very different things5 - Finally, not all the other contestants get recording contracts."
2,"Great content, bad disc!","As an American Idol addict, I was loving this DVD. I loved rewatching the performances. It was great for giving me my American Idol fix as I wait for the season premiere in January. But then I got to the season reviews, and the disc crapped out on me. The picture was jumbled, so was the sound. It just wasn't worth it to watch the rest of it like that. And yes, the whole rest of the disc was like that. I bought another disc in hopes that the new one would work, and had the same problem. If you're only buying for the first half of the disc, by all means, buy it. But if you're excited to watch the entire disc, you're going to be disappointed if you end up with a bad disc like I did."
4,American Idols DVD,"I've enjoyed watching this DVD, it sure brings back great memories of the first 4 seasons of American Idol. I would reccomend it to anyone who follows the show regularly."
5,Max & Ruby - A Merry Bunny Christmas DVD,"Purchased this DVD as an addition to our daughters movie collection. She loves Max and Ruby, and the christmas theme of this DVD helped us get her into the christmas spirit. Super fast shipping, super low price."
4,"Best Kid's Shows, For The Little Ones, or Anyone!","Each episode is delightful, and heart felt. Max is the typical busy toddler! He is in search of adventure,and he has many ideas! He is constantly keeping his sister, Ruby, on her toes.This DVD has a good share of holiday fare,along with regular episodes. It is sure to spark holiday cheer, without being too long of duration. This keeps small children occupied.The minuses are small, with little extras,and no closed captioning."
2,Harsh Read,It was not what I expected. It was heart wrentching and sad but good too. Hard to say but not the light hearted romance I was expecting. Keep your tissues near.
3,Devil's Mistress,"The very first part of the book is good. It does downhill from there. Who in their right mind after being accused of being a witch and almost getting killed because of it, sticks around somewhere else where they start crying witch again and killing people. At the end after Sloan gets Brianna out of there, she fights being with him. It just was kind of stupid. Not one of her better books. Guess I just did not really care for this one. It's not that it was horrible, just something about it did not sit right with me. I also had a hard time deciding between a 2 and a 3 on this one. Not one of my books I will re-read as there are so many I enjoy more than this. I have read it twice, but just forgot after reading it so long ago, that I did not really care for it."
4,I think it's a Stilton.,"It's a rare jem. It's earned a place on my comedy charts above Speed 2. And that's saying something special. If you want trippy sci-fi that makes you piss yourself laughing, buy it, don't think, just enjoy."
2,You stupid Earthlings would watch anything,"To call this low budget or a b movie would be too kind. There is no war. It is like looking for Kong on Kong Island, or the She Gods of Shark Reef. It just ain't gon'a happen.Captain Alex Hamilton (John Richardson) hates machines that think they are smart enough to give orders. His Commander is in silent agreement. Therefore, it is off to space for Hamilton who will be out of range of the knowledge needed to run the WIZ or order-giving machine.On his way home, a mysterious signal and a couple of denigration toting alien drones deter Hamilton. Wouldn't you know it he is up against an alien order-giving machine. Shades of ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" (1970).Will Hamilton just have to take orders or can he come up with a unique corrective answer that has success in biblical times?Don't worry no matter what he does the movie will probably go on and on and on Earthlings.Colossus - The Forbin Project"
4,Product review,For the Money it is a sound buy and it has the essential to get you started. All you really need is a Montor and maybe a printer and scanner. all can be brought for less than 200.00. For 339.00 it's a good starter PC for a Novice or a student to use for just about anything. I have built 6 PC's myself so I would buy it for myself if I were intereted in another PC.
5,The Family Virtues Guide,This is a perfect parents guide and is a philosophy that everyone should adopt. It stresses the importance of all the good virtues that a person should possess. These principles teach a child to be a responsible and good citizen. Parents learn while they are teaching the child.
5,Charley Craft: The life and Times of a North Carolinian turned Oklahoma Homesteader 1872-1834,A very good book and research on the life and times of Charlie Craft. Such hardships but nothing seem to stand in his way.
5,Excellent Mr. Samad,Anthony Asadullah Samad writes from his heart. This is a book about rebirth and the changes that he went thru to become who he is today. It's about being an advocate for his people at all cost. It should be required reading for African American Studies everywhere. It will captures you from the beginning until the end. Excellent debut Mr. Samad.
5,Great book on mobile security,"I really liked this book due to its breadth and attention to examples. Since the book goes from basics to advanced topics, it was easy to understand. The authors did a good job in bringing up theory and tying it to practical applications. The diagrams and tables were very useful as I seriously did not plan to read every page! The IT manager notes and tips boxes were nice so that, again, I did not have to read every single page!The other thing I liked was the actual layout of the material. It was relatively easy to read and the diagrams, text size, and headings all made it useful as a reference book. I do plan to refer back to this as it seems to have very interesting material that can be used as a basis elsewhere."
4,My husband really enjoyed this CD.,I ordered it for him as he is a big Lawerence Welk Show fan. This seems to be the only website where I have found some CDs of the Lawerence Welk show performers.
5,Fit for Summer,"Did I need motivation? Did I need to get into shape? Did I need to get more flexable? Did I need to get off the couch and move? The answer to these questions were all YES!!. Did I do anything about it? The answer is yes!! By getting the CD by Eric Wilson called Fitness Rhythms I actually looked forward to getting into shape, being more flexable and getting away from the TV. I used the fitness cd daily. I would put it on and start my exercise. First with the stationary bike, than with just dancing. It worked for me. Different from other CD's it actually takes you from warm-up to full throttle, and than back again. I even lost a few pounds which were ""icing on the cake"". I look forward to the next Wilson CD."
2,Fitness Rythms,"I am not very happy with this product. What it doesn't tell you is that the personal trainer talks through the entire CD. I was looking for music for my classes and this doesn't work because of the voice over. I liked the music and if I could get rid of the voice over it would be perfect for the workout as it stands, I can't use it."
5,Get Sweaty,"If you need some music to get your ass off the couch, this one will do it for you. It starts with a mellow beat, but the narrator quickly gets you into the groove with some serious rhythm. Great for taking to the gym or on a run. I even listen to it in the car."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Griffin reminds me of a boxer that fights one too many times and is rendered brain damaged.Griffin is living proof that men aren't the only ones who can be pigs sometimes. Women can be too. She's a foul-mouthed idiot who isn't even funny.With this she has truly proven to be lower than D-List, E-List is a better term to describe her."
1,TERRIBLE AS USUAL,"Kathy Griffin is a terrible comedian. This sucked, as most of her stuff does. I don't know why I even watched it."
5,Really Great!,Love having the uncensored specials plus they put everything that was cut out of the TV special as an extra feature so you get to see the whole show. Love her and have all her DVD's.
2,"Lots of story, not so much on the whole jokes thing","I always think she is funny so decided to try this out. It is entertaining to listen to her stories about the Emmy's, her visit to Cher's house, and her mom but is more of a narrative with amusing anecdotes than laugh out loud jokes."
2,Not classic Kathy material,"I got this DVD last night and watched it with my mom. We are both huge Kathy fans and have seen her Stand up on TV and seen her ""Life on the D-List"" show. This DVD (SHE'LL CUT A BITCH) seemed short and we probably laughed once the whole time... I should have listened to someone elses review who said it wasn't great because after watching it I wouldn't have bought it. Sorry Kathy we love you!"
1,Not this particular DVD.,This particular performance is not worth watching. There are decent bits but it's not justifiable as an investment of time or money. Try something else.
1,Expecting A LOT MORE,"I love comedy and it isn't all that hard to make me laugh, as long as there is some substance to your jokes and its done the right way (duh). This dvd is not worth buying because all Kathy Griffin does is talk about shallow topics in an anecdotal way which gets kind of boring and monotonous. There are no jokes, just a bunch of stories where she tries to make it seem funny. She has done better shows, I know that for sure. It is not worth buying AT ALL. Good thing I saw it for free on Amazon Prime's Instant Video."
4,"Don't ""Suck It"", its great!","I love, love, love Kathy Griffin. She's so funny and such an ""on point"" honest comedian. This DVD was funny and I watch it over and over again."
1,Not interesting at all,"Shapiro does a really a great job in Globe trecker Mexico city. I cannot appreciate all of the sexual inuendos. I think people sheould come to their own conclusions, especially when it comes to art. I also do not rate highly her friends as she travels. I think she could find people with more class. Most of us who travel like to enjoy good travel information with some class. I do however like Globe trekker Belgium and Luxembourg. Those were well presented and classy."
3,Strange movie,"The jealousy struggle between the two sons (one in particualr) and their mother following the father's death and the appearance of another man in the picture is understandable enough, but some of the other turns in this telling leave me cold. I followed the emotional conflicts OK. The aarson attack felt extreme and crude with the shooting prelude and event worse yet. But maybe it's a cultural thing and I don't get it. Anyway, my curiosity on this film is satisfied. I think it's a flop but gave it a neutral rating for its slight cultural and/or emotional worth."
3,Good bread but...,"The title of Cooking with Artisan Bread is a bit misleading. Bassetti and Galton give only one recipe for artisan bread at the opening of the book. That one bread is indeed excellent. The crust is chewy and the interior is moist and delicious. However, be aware that the recipes in the balance of the book are for dishes one would serve with the bread -- having only a passing connection with artisan bread; e.g., Macrina's Ham and Cheese Panini is delicious but is not ""cooking with artisan bread."" In summary, the book's misleading title is a disappointment for those of us interested in artisan bread. So make your purchase based on the book's actual content, not what the title purports. A better choice for bread bakers would be The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking by Brother Rick Curry; it's filled with wonderful recipes and bread lore."
2,It's Ok,"Better to read Presentations for Profits. This book is just a collection of random ideas that don't really help at all. The last chapters are a bit better because they have to do with a certain topic, but most of the stuff can be found in Presentations for Profits book."
1,sold as is,Crane has gone bankrupt there is no tech support and I recieved a bad module. They did let me return the unit but I think that they will sell thier stock as is from now on.
1,Outrageously Overpriced,"Well, let's just say that this is one way to finance your career transition--sell a very short book for a very big price. The first few chapters, which describe some of the cultural norms that may impede a physician's career transition, were engaging and informative. About a third of the way through, though, the book became pure, unadulterated, non-informative filler. Meanwhile, the book is priced like a medical textbook. Under no circumstances should anyone buy this book at full price. Just because I made this mistake doesn't mean the rest of you have to! ;-)"
4,slipper socks,"The ad says fits all sizes - that means fat feet only. They contantly skew around my feet so that the non-slip portion is in top of my foot,"
5,Bob Guyer-Guide to State Legislative Lobbying & Seminar,"I highly reccomend Bob Guyer's Guide to State Legislative Lobbying as well as his seminar. The information provided in Bob's book is highly informative and clearly presented. Bob discussion on the theory of lobbying and its importance to all organizations should be require reading for senior management and decision makers. The wealth of experience and the passion Bob displays in his seminars will leave a lasting positive impression. As a lobbyist for both Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, the principles I learned from Bob were used in my day to day interaction with legislators, regulators, and executive branch officials.Mark ReedGuide to State Legislative Lobbying, Third Edition"
1,Rip Off,"This book is a complete rip off. It's a tiny paperback with ""fluff"" note pages inserted to bulk it up. The information is very basic. There's no way it's worth $50!"
5,Guyer's on the money,"A seasoned pol once said that ""Getting the vote is 10 percent access and 90 percent heat.""Frankly, what Bob Guyer's guidebook doesn't teach is what it can't teach - building personal connections with legislators to gain access. For everything else, Bob has written a complete and carefully thoughtout guide to preparing and successfully steering legislation. In other words, bringing the ""heat.""He doesn't offer all the answers, since the nuances of each bill and state legislature prohibit a cookie-cutter approach. Instead, Guyer asks, and gets you to ask, the right questions to guide your bill writing, lobbying team organization and strategic plan.His many years of experience are condensed into a book that reveals the secrets of the temple."
1,Copyright Fraud,Nothing is in color except the cover. I have never had a problem and usually give high reviews but this guy obviously is committing copyright fraud by copying the pages himself. The top captions and page number of each page are cut off when trying to copy the pages and the pictures are all black and white. He is lucky I don't care about the pictures otherwise I might want my money back.
5,A Classic in Georgia Archaeology,"""The Waring Papers"" is a posthumous collection of the various writings of Dr. Antonio J. Waring, a Savannah doctor with a deep and abiding love of the archaeological heritage of his native state of Georgia. Waring was a prodigy in that not being a trained archaeologist, he understood it better than most archaeologists of his day. He also furthered its advancement through scientific studies and reports, and these are collected from various sources and from his unpublished papers for this volume, which is highly recommended to all who share a passion for Southeastern archaeology."
5,Very well designed,"This is a very well designed and manufactured little item. It does not drip in the slightest and is rather elegant. It's a tad larger than I would have liked, so pay attention to the size, but it's still very nice. It arrived in less than two days, so the kind of high shipping charge was worth it. It reminds me of a little bird!"
1,Factory reset,No where it was ever made clear that the device MUST be sent to factory for resetting every 2 to 3 years at a minimum of &#1611;$180 plus parts costs.It says in marketing materials never needs factory calibration.
4,"Good product, deceptive marketing","Good flavor, taste, texture, however disappointed in the amount.It stated a shipping weight of 1.8 pounds so I figured about a pound or so of salmon...actually only gives 3 four ounce packages surrounded by a wood frame. Forget the fancy packaging and give bigger filets! Still, a good product.Steve T."
2,"Not sliced, & not so good","If you are expecting sliced, translucent smoked salmon like millions of stores carry for aboutthe same price, you will be disappointed. This is smallish hunk of fairly heavily brined salmonin a sort of foil casing with more brine. You can perhaps make a spread using cream cheese, lemonand other ingredients, and it would be servicable- but it sure isn't the stuff you'd put on yourbagel or use for canapes. It also had a sort of dried out quality to it, in spite of the brine.I would not order it again."
1,Not indestructible.,"I used to think Schubert's 9th was ""indestructible"" music, because I'd never heard a bad performance of it. Well, Yuasa has changed that. I love this symphony, but in Yuasa's hands it just plods along with no form or sense of purpose. There's no feeling that any moment is connected to any other moment. By the middle of the second movement I just didn't care anymore if I heard the rest of it. But I persevered, and found myself noticing how out of balance the various sections of the orchestra sounded. When the performance finished, I felt I had heard the notes, but I hadn't heard a _symphony_.The recorded sound is adequate; a bit distant and over-resonant."
3,How can you judge between excellent Callas and horrible Tucker?,"Richard Tucker spoiled two potentially great Callas operas from La Scale in hte Fifties, this La Forza and the Aida. I cannot fathom why EMI used him; despite his fame at the Met, this bawling, crude tenor with his ubiquitous sobs and woeful lack of interpretation, had no international career and not much of one outside New York City.Callas reputedly had vocal problems during the recording, and yet this is one of her signature roles. She conveys the tragedy of Leonora's situation as no one else ever has. It's unfortunate that there is so much beautiful singing to do, however, because Callas wasn't beautiful vocally the way Sutherland, Tebaldi, and Leontyne Price were. So I keep this set in order to listen to Callas and skip all the bits with Tucker, while for the complete opera I turn to the RCA set under Levine with Price and Domingo."
2,Sound doesn't synch with the start of the movie,There is no way to not autostart the movie. Technical support was of no help. The music does not start at the same time as the movie.
1,Refuses to Work,"Products like this are why piracy is rampant. Here is a product that is sold and flat out doesn't work for a lot of people. I used an older version and loved it. (Version 3.) Since version 4, on multiple systems, it refuses to work correctly, crashing at various stages.When it DOES work, it's a fantastic program. Just be aware you really are taking a gamble that it'll work okay for you.Look on it as an exciting bet. You may get an awesome app. You may get a coaster."
1,Waste of Money,I don't normally write reviews but this product is HORRIBLE. The sound doesn't match up with the video and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of customer service. Don't waste your money.
3,it's alright.,"The neck gaitors that we were issued in the military are almost nothing like this. They were tighter, longer, and probably warmer, too.Oh, well!"
4,Great sign,I was very suprised of how nice this sign was.It is a very nice sign for the money. I highly recommend this sign.
5,Exactly as described,"This Stop Sign looks exactly like the picture and looks great in my Colts-themed room. There's not much to say about it really, but I will say one thing critical of it. There is a small hole at the top and the bottom about the size of a hole-punch on notebook paper. But I don't know what the holes are there for. It still looks great and doesn't cause me to drop the rating down to four stars, but I wonder why it was made with those holes."
3,In need of support!,"This bra is not very supportive at all for larger sized women. I thought that since it came in the larger sizes that it was made for that, but that is really not the case. It could be used more like a sleep bra, I guess, but that is not what I was looking for. I also don't like that you have to pull it over your head to get it on and off, and it works like a sports bra, and squishes you together in the middle, creating one big lump across your chest.I had a Bravado bra with my first pregnancy and liked it, but I guess this one is not the same style."
1,No such story,This story is unauthorised and the publishers have gone bust. See www.casca.net for details.
2,Hopkins deserves more,"Anthony Hopkins, being, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors, deserves more in a biography than this. The book is basic and tells you information, but in trying to make it unique, the author bores you, confused you, and makes you less interested in reading it."
2,Light-weight biography of an acting heavyweight,"I read the original biography by Quentin Falk, a showbiz hack and mediocre writer, several years ago and remember it only as a very superficial treatment of a very complex man. This new update contains too much spin control by Hopkins' ex-wife and not enough insight into the man himself (or seemingly input from him) to make it worthwhile. Hopkins is a great actor and a very intriguing man, he deserves a more in-depth analysis of both his work and his persona than Falk can provide."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Product - Buy a Tablet/Touch PC","I've owned a MPP for almost 3 years and I've come to realize that it's a great idea but a very poor product. My first complaint is the battery life - since day 1 the battery would not hold a charge for more than 30 minutes. I sent it back to Freehand and they supposedly replaced it but the second battery did exactly the same thing. Now it doesn't hold a charge at all and I have to use the power cord every time. I've considered buying a new battery but Freehand forces you to purchase 2 at a time for $90! No thanks! My second complaint is that the hardware is slow and the software is very limited in what it can do.Buy an iPad at half the price or a touch PC for the same price and get much, much, much functionality with faster speeds and loads more battery life.On a related note, I have a MPP for sale if anyone ignores my comments above and is interested :)."
3,Music Pad Pro,"I have been using the Music Pad Pro for 5 years and it has been a lifesaver. The problems with it are the footpedal and the battery. The footpedal works intermittingly and the battery is going dead to the point that using ac power takes a while for the unit to start working. There is no support from the company for this unit and I have had to resort to using an opposite polarity chord to turn the pages backwards. I print them in a backword mode so that I start with the (last page first). I did not find converting the Word documents that I set up on my computer to be any problem. I simply print them to the ""freehand printer"" and they get formatted correctly. Using Bold Arabic makes them very visible. Even with the problems I have with this unit it is well worth the money."
3,MusicPad Pro,"Over the years I've really enjoyed this product. Even with software/hardware shortcomings, it beats packing around a small suitcase of gig books. With the introduction of modern pads like the iPad (too small), the Freehand unit needs an upgrade. They're working on it but progress is slow.

3,Songs and Dances from Poland,"The music track doesn't have a nice sound. The music itself is fine, but the audio isn't as nice as it should be."
4,A Real Page-Turner!,"This book is great - for what it is. In fact, it succeeds wildly in its genre of plain, entertaining gay novels. It is a LOT better than most of them, but not for those who only embrace the real literary stuff. Think Jackie Collins or Judith Krantz for the gay set. Characters are fun -- villains and heroes, both -- and all have detailed back histories (or baggage) to carry around. Occasionally its has an uncomfortable Gordon Merrick moment, but it comes back again. Highly recommended for a true entertaining read."
5,Something to wake up for,"I brought ""Winter"" on vacation with me because I loved the title so much, and I was captured immediately by the beautifully written first line. Although I'm at a point in my life where I often fall asleep reading a few pages, this book kept me up until midnight--and I got up at 6 am the next morning to finish it! The story is well-paced, absorbing and evocative of the 70s; the characters are totally believable and sympathetic; and the subtle word play is witty and hilarious. Often when I read first novels I find myself getting sort of anxious on behalf of the novelist, but in this case I was completely confident that the author wouldn't betray my trust. I was rewarded with a great, satisfying read and the only thing I regret is that I no longer have the anticipation of discovering the pleasure this book gave me."
4,With apologies to Shakespeare and Steinbeck,"I ordered this book on a whim and wound up enjoying it -- in the sense that there is so little truly worthwhile contemporary gay fiction to begin with. This book starts on the longest day of the year in the last summer of the 1960s, and from there becomes a ""pilgrim's progress"" -- or more properly a ""rake's progress"" -- for a young, impossibly attractive Florida teen, taking him through the 1970s and 1980s. The shallowness, humor, and plot contrivances of this novel are, curiously, part of its appeal."
3,Colorful Booklet For Beginners & Tourists,"This 15 page booklet has some very nice color photographs of the Palo Alto and Resaca De La Palma Battlefields, modern & period drawings, photos of artifacts, a photo of part of a US military uniform, map of contested lands, and a map drawn by a US participant. There is also a brief guide to further reading which includes sources in English and Spanish. This booklet is similar to other booklets in the series of National Parks from Southwest Parks and Monuments Association, because it is intended for the visitor who wants the just a little more than the basics. The booklet might be good for students who need a quick, easy to read, condensed version of the battle for a History report in high school, too."
5,Excellent book for Christians who love fantasies,"Whether you agree with him or not, Veith knows how to make a Christian think. I happen to agree with him, though. I've read most of Veith's books, and I was not disappointed by this one. I thoroughly enjoyed it, learned valuable things I didn't know, and highly recommend it to all Christians who love fantasy literature, and to all parents whose children love fantasy literature."
2,These clamps are junk,"I purchased 2 of these clamps several years ago. Out of the package it was easy to see these were more cheap Chinese junk from Delta. Looking on Amazon I see 'Steelex' brand clamps seem to be a little more substantial. Think I will give them a try. If you are looking for a strong clamp with good holding capacity, do not buy the Delta ones."
3,So close,"A great idea that is poorly crafted. Poor quality materials and assembly doom this model to obscurity in the Tool Hall of Fame.The clamping turnbuckle is cast, not machined. In an effort to clean it up, I reamed it with the appropriate tap (10mm -1.50). The casting material just fell out like sand grains/powder as the reamer trued up the cast, female threads in the turnbuckle body. The clamping screw is machined but required several passes with a die for cleanup. The clamp still rotates hesitantly, even with a liberal application of lubricant.The pivot points on the vice arms have extremely loose tolerances (>.010""). This slop causes the whole tool to feel like a rag doll when loose in your hand and to wobble when applying a clamping force. Took a good wack on the upper, pivot point rivets to tighten the bearing surfaces to acceptable levels."
2,Poor quality product,Looks like and feels like a cheap tool. Flimsy. Nothing like any Delta product I've ever seen.
3,Good but faulty movie,"My daughter enjoyed the Dora Saves the Mermaids movie, but when she tried to go to the menu selection and pick which movie she wanted next, the last option began in the middle of the episode each time."
2,3 episodes - not a movie,"I thought this was a movie, but is is 3 different Dora episodes, one just happens to be ""save the Mermaids"" could have just ""TIVO'ed it."""
3,It's alright,"My daughter loves Dora, so I got this movie. She likes it but it's not her favorite. It's kind of boring."
1,Garbage,"These are not properly manufactured. I'd stay away from the entire Nature's Life brand if I were you. These capsules are not appropriate for their contents, and moisture seeps in and immediately turns the powdered extract into a rotten tar-like substance, funky smell included. These expire in 4 years according to my label, but I'd guess they actually expired a while ago. Who knows why/how this kind of bad product got into my hands -- manufacturer, reseller, quality control, I have no idea, but this product is poor enough quality I can say unreservedly that no one should ever ingest it."
4,question!!!,well i have the other guides to the other ones but this one cant be ordered at barnes and noble and i come on here but i want to know why its so expensive..??i cant figure out how to play it without the book...
3,Not really my thoughts.,These aren't really all of what I belief but was presented in a very interesting way. Would be helpful if you are of the Mormon faith.
3,Reasons to buy and not to buy,"Reasons to buy:+THREE containers with enough volume to store most prepared meals.+Probably the best bang for the buck you'll find on Amazon+rough base makes it less slippery on a flat surface (see below about stacking)Reasons not to buy:-Lid design that snaps together with other lids is a raised cylindrical shape in the middle of the lid*Design is not very useful, as conventional lids could be stacked although not secured. See Rubbermaid for a better lid design-The construction of this product makes it slippery when stacked.-Why do these manufacturers always add so many USELESS engravings to the containers? They only make them harder to hand wash. This product is no exception-Regular cheap plastic thats flimsy and absorbs odors overtime. No idea if its bpa freeOverall I recommend it just because its cheap."
5,For my sister-in law,"When we go to my brother's house for dinner, my sister-in-law always sends us home with left-overs in plastic containers. These were perfect to act as replacements for her supply."
1,"Ugh, I hate these","They have that weird lid, with the center piece so the lids snap together. That's okay, if I stored the lids separate from the dishes, and if the bump to accommodate the snapping didn't make the lid less user friendly when I try to use it in conjunction with the dish. Doesn't work for me. Not recommended."
4,Exactly what I needed,Great size to store leftovers. This allowed me to buy more than one container without having to get the other miscellaneous sizes that I don't want or need.
1,The cover is Misleading!!!!!!,Do not buy this DVD! The cover of this dvd is so misleading it should be illegal. Basically you amateurs walking around videotaping women back sides with a cheap video camera. The female you see on this cover is not to be found on this disc and it's not what you think nor expect. The editing skills is completely annoying and unnecessary. Trust me on this one and save your money. Hell I'll copy the dvd and send it to you and believe you me its not worth a 10 cent disc. I understand entrepreneurship and creativity but this is a sham.
5,A True Sleeper,"For those of you who may be doubters, be assured that this is exciting Beethoven. If you love this symphony surely you must be frustrated with the namby-pamby, wimpy performances of most recordings. This may not be the most polished 7th but it is truly a gem. If you have been wishing for a 7th with muscle, a 7th that truly is ""the apotheosis of the dance,"" this is the closest you will come with performances on CD today. This 7th sings and dances and gets right in your face. It is wild and unrestrained as I believe Beethoven intended it to be. Bravo, Barry. You got it right, man!"
4,Nice watch,"Good looking ,good quality. Good price.It can be hard to read, especially at 40+ yrs of age, but I am very happy considering the price."
3,No nonsense,"An information-packed guide giving lots of overview information on a wide range of issues facing the UN, as well as on how the UN was formed and how it goes about its work. The no-nonsense edition is not very user-friendly, with heavy black type and no pictures or other softening features, but the information itself seems to be very complete, well-managed with regards to clarity for the layman, and extremely interesting for world politic afficianados or students."
3,Accurate But Flat,"Warning -- like many first novels by authors whose previous works were all non-fiction, this one is poorly written andpoorly edited (right down to omitted commas for almost every subordinate clause). Despite obviously authentic details onbloody battles and civilian suffering, the narrative is so flatthat it often sounds more like a story retold on the porch of a hospital than the ""saga"" (Toland's own word) it was meant to be.The potentially most interesting inside story -- how and why theJapanese leaders decided to wage war on a vastly larger enemy -- is also the most confusingly told.All that said, if you like Pacific Theatre novels, this one is worth reading. And if you want to see how a genuinely good novelist covers the same ground (or islands), read just the relevant parts of Neal Stephenson's ""Cryptonomicon""."
4,Look and See,"As a newlywed, it it very helpful at highlighting problem areas and helping with solutions. Purchased this shortly before I eloped and started it then. It still is helpful after you're married."
3,A few helpful insights but I didn't learn much,"Maybe it is simply because I have read many resources about Christian marriage, but I did not receive much benefit from this devotional book. My fiance and I picked up this book, because it is the only one we have seen on the market for engaged or dating couples, rather than married couples. The reading is not backed up by much scripture."
4,A great buy for couples,"This book is really good, because it gets you and your significant other talking about important issues that matter. So, in a sense, this book is a conversation starter. I recommend this book for couples that are seeking a deeper relationship. Word of caution though. This book, I feel, is more directed at the engaged couple, but there are still some really good things in there for you two."
3,A decent couple's devotional,"-Marriage is the focus of Starting Out Together. This book doesn't deal too much in the dating or engaged stage of a relationship, but it highlights several aspects of marriage to get the couple to be thinking about long-term commitment.-The topics change daily, rather than having a weekly theme to tie several reflections together. Therefore, you don't explore a theme in very much depth and touch on a broad range of topics rather than several key ones.-The daily devotionals are generally a page and a half and leave a bit to be desired. The goal is to get you and your partner to discuss the content and the subject in more detail, but I often got to the end of the devotional and feel a little disappointed that Wright didn't go further.-The book has sparked a lot of discussion between me and my partner, though. We have been able to grow closer together through this devotional and therefore it accomplishes the task it was meant for."
1,Weak Sauce.,"Honestly, I feel that this was written for the spiritually immature. This book has no real insight and does nothing to inspire anything more than the most superficial exploration of faith and love."
4,"Worth a read, even if you're not a LEO","I bought this book in the hopes that, as a concealed weapons holder, there might be some useful bits to learn. As expected, though, the book is heavily centered on techniques and procedures that I would never encounter. Nonetheless, the book is a fascinating read on why police officers behave the way that they do, with numerous examples of police officers who died when they let their judgment lapse.The downside is this book is very out of date. Published in 1980, the book could use an update that includes more modern procedures and weapons usage. Regardless, it's worth a read by anyone in the law enforcement field."
3,Why cops act the way they do.,"Street Survival opens a window to what law enforement encounter on a daily basis. The police never know what they may run in to when they leave home each day. They don't know wether they will even live to see another day.When nothing is happening; nothing is happening. Most of the time, police work is extremely boring. When something happens, it's all or nothing.Police carry guns and they have to make split secound decesion pull a weapon and fire. People in law enforcement are under great pressure doing a mostly thankless job."
3,Street Survival,Useful text but needs a reasonable amount of technical knowledge for it to make sense. Well worth the read if that's you.
2,easy read but thin on content,"This book does a great job of paralleling basic business concepts with Monopoly game play. This would work perfectly if business was conducted by four persons in your living room.The book covers concepts including aggressiion, opportunity, maximizing odds and negotiation. If you find these concepts new or intriguing then this is a great book for you. I found it somewhat humorous and witty but not enough to recommend to friends.I do find myself oddly excited about my next game of Monopoly as I now have some insights on game strategy that I never knew or cared about before."
2,Book Lacked Focus,"This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish. Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life? In both cases, it came up lacking. The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game. For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life. That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative. Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it."
4,Wrong Side Of The Whip is rocking my brains out,What is the deal with this band? I don't know anything about them but Wrong Side Of The Whip is rocking my brains out. Somebody at ITunes put it on a playlist of songs from the Scorcese movie The Departed but it is not on the soundtrack.Tracklist:Taken A LifetimeFirst Thing I WantIn The CityDown On My LadyTen Times As HeavyGod Is CocaineFlowerWrong Side Of The WhipHardcore CaliforniaWasteland
3,Very short.,"I wanted this book because I read a review that said it had a ""liberal, left wing agenda."" Sadly, I didn't see that, but maybe you had to be there.A young girl creeped out by Santa Claus invents her own holiday gift-giver (Potato Claus) and writes a play about him that she and some friends put on for the class. There is a strange obsession with potatoes.This book is really short with big type and lots of color illustrations, so there isn't much room for the usual Pinkwater weirdness. It's still kind of nifty, though."
1,Worthless as a first repertoire book,"With all due respect to the other reviewers, who are likely more accomplished players than I am, I found this book fairly useless, and worse yet a waste of time that I could have been spending learning more opening concepts. The problem may have been my expectations for the book -- it's obviously intended for an advanced audience -- but I took Gufeld at his word when he says that players of all levels can benefit from the book... Note especially the point about people buying repertoire books to save time, whereas GM Gufeld's choices require far more time to digest tons of theory.For us patzers, the best opening ""repertoire"" I've found so far is in the last three chapters of Seirawan's _Winning Chess Openings_. It may lack the sheer volume of variations that a strong player would require, but it's very strong on concepts, which is what I need."
2,Jumping that old Shark Second Season,"I was highly disappointed after watching the wonderful first season to see this group of lackluster episodes. The addition of ""The Diner"" and it's manager the love guru, Parker's new steady girlfriend (a surefire shark jumper right there) plus the toned downed hatred and angst of all the other characters, Larry K, Parker's Sister, fleshing out of every villain in the show, made the season all about camera angles and which guest star can we spot.The writing was FAR less witty and creative compared to the first, and I must say, I can't imagine season 3 being any better. That said, I treasure the first season, which was Gold."
4,Colourful shirts and characters,"Parker and his shirts, is just as colourful today as he was back in 1990. It was fun to step back in time and relive the highschool years"
4,LIFE MUSIC,"Yo, loving this dude, been feeling the Celestial Blues track for some time now although the version on this album is different from the Gary Bartz one. I'm all about this style of music, with emphasis on the life lyrics, this is what we all need in excessive amounts to maintain. ..."
5,Great Viper,"An excellent product and great service, easy to follow directions and support. Quick delivery and service!!!!!!!!!!"
1,All thumbs down on this.,"This ipod arm band case was the worst thing I've ever gotten. Luckily it was cheap. Learned my lesson. Sloppy stitching, color was not as shown, and worse...the case didn't come close to fitting! The dial window was way too high to fit my Ipod nano 2. Go somewhere else and pay more!"
4,nice,"it takes like 2 or 3 weeks until you notice the effect but as soon as it does ,for sure you are going to feel the pump!!! nice product with no ""2 effects"""
3,Average,"Perhaps for the fact that the story about the ""Untitled Fourth Album"" was explored numberless times, this book didn't appeal very much for me.On the other hand, it has provided a few interesting details about the band at that time, such as the research for coming up with the symbols choosen by each member (tough Jimmy's is still a secret) and other stuff.I didn't like the somewhat weird CD format. It makes it looks less serious than it is, actually."
5,Wow! It features original cast members from the original TV show from the 70's!!!,"What a great set of DVD's (six DVD's with four episodes each,for a grand total of 24!!!) from Questar Home Video!!! A great show for the whole family,""The New Adventures Of Black Beauty"" from the early 90's has two of the original cast members (William ""Doctor Gordon"" Lucas and Stacy ""Jenny Gordon"" Dorning)from the original classic British series from the early 70's!!! So,if you were a fan of the original series you'll love this one too!!! It even has the classic original theme song that was used in the original series!!! Also recommended for horse lovers!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
4,Why missing two episodes?,"This was one one my favorite series when I was a child. What's not to love? Beautiful scenery, wonderful horses, independent teenage girl, and cute German guy. But I never met anyone else who had even heard of it, so I was very much surprised to find it available on DVD. Also delighted, because I'd only managed to tape 15 of the 26 episodes. But when I got the DVD I saw there were only 24 episodes. Why on earth did they leave off 'Horsepower' and 'Horse Sense', two perfectly innocuous episodes? I can't understand how or why this oversight happened. It's just so annoying, I buy DVDs in order to get rid of my tapes, and now I have to keep this one. And I'm left with this little nagging feeling whenever I look at my DVD set on the shelf, and remember that it's not quite complete. Absolute torture for one with OCD."
5,A Book that Lasts a Lifetime,Extraordinary and completely unique work of memoir and psychological insight. I read this book nearly twenty years ago and it has stayed with me all these years. An unusual story of the Holocaust and one that stands out in its attempt to understand the influence of the perception of evil on the psychology of the individual and the individual's response when it meets it in reality. The other reviewers understand the profound insight this book offers.
3,Tea,"Although it didn't taste bad, my girlfriend had to drink a few cups to get results. Otherwise it was nice and helpful."
5,It works!!,"I had bought this tea for two of my daughters. They both have problems with their hormones at certain times of the month. They both looked at me with a ""What are you trying to tell me?"" expression. I didn't hear any thing about the tea until just lately when my younger daughter said her sister recommended it to her because she had tried it after a particularly stressful day and it worked. My younger daughter said she tried it and it seemed to work for her also."
1,Don't like the taste!,"I bought this tea after doing some online research, that stated how beneficial it was for women with painful menstrual cycles/PMS. The box does not look like the picture, it's totally different, and it claims to be organic when in fact it's part organic, not 100%. I really can't say whether this works or helps because I couldn't get past the first cup! It tastes like licorice (to me), which I hate, so I cannot drink this tea. I'm used to drinking herbal fruit teas, so this is not palatable for me."
1,New part was defective,"The new part worked for about a week so I through away the noisy but functioning original. Then the car started being hard to start sometimes. Eventually it wouldn't start. long story short: o-ring for the pressure regulator wasn't installed right, and moved, causing a loss of fuel pressure. I took it apart and reassembled and got it working again, but it didn't hold pressure per the spec. Plus since it had started out ok once, I didn't trust it. So I replaced it again.It cost me a few hundred extra to get it sorted out.Amazon promptly refunded my money for the part, but not the few hundred extra their defective part cost me.Do yourself a favor and blow on the tube before you install it. If you can blow through it, return it."
5,Service was Great,had a problem with the actual color and the guys at Boston solved it with complete professionalism. Thanks John...
5,worst review of a CD...,"The review written by nmernst is just plain embarrassing. Please don't let it dissuade you from considering this historic recording. If nmernst would promise never to write another review for a Classical CD, I would be glad to perform the service of purchasing this CD from him/her."
4,Elena,Interesting story slow paced a realistic portrait of a family and their interactions.and an understanding end of the story although disappointing
3,Elena,"This Russian film is similar to other Eastern European or Scandinavian movies that I have recently watched like My Joy, Aurora, Michael and Noi. The suspense in this film is built on what is not said rather than dialogues.This film is filled with slow-paced, with long winded shots of every day routines and scenes that depict an atmosphere of bleakness, and a satisfactory and unexpected ending that compensates the long wait.However, my reason for not giving it more than three stars is that it all happened too easily. Elena takes a decision and with no problem whatsoever carries it out without any sort of obstacle. I gave it three stars for the ending and take away two stars for the lack of conflict."
1,disappointed,I was really disappointed. Not what I was looking for. I wanted more fireworks. Not the history of. I bought this for my autistic nephew for Christmas. Fireworks captivates him and thats what I thought I was buying. I record Thunder over Louisville for him every year.I should have watched it before giving to him.
1,SHOULD'VE BEEN CALLED BATHMAT,"I ORDERED THIS RUG FOR MY GRANDSON AGE 5 WHO WANTED A TRAIN TRACK RUG TO PLAY ON. ONE REVIEW STATED THAT HER BOYS HAD ENJOYED MANY HOURS OF FUN PLAY ON THEIRS SO I ASSUMED IT WAS MUCH LARGER. IT IS ONLY A BATHMAT SIZE. I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT, I PAID $30 AND WAS ABLE TO FIND A MUCH LARGER TRAIN TRACK RUG FOR $50 WITH FREE SHIPPING BUT DECIDED IT WAS TOO MUCH TROUBLE & EXPENSE FOR RETURN SHIPPING, SO I GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO A FRIEND WITH A YOUNGER SON. I WAS DISSAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT IS TOO SMALLTO PLAY ON, BUT AS A BATH MAT OR BEDSIDE RUG, IT WOULD BE FINE."
1,DIY,"This backer pad will not center itself on the grinder's 5/8"" spindle due to its oversize mounting hole. It appears this design depends on the lock nut for centering. However, the lock nut is undersized and too small for the sanding disk's hole to allow the sanding disk to center itself. The end result is an un-centered pad and an un-centered sanding disk which result in undesired vibrations. I am returning this one and looking for another brand in hope of a more precise design."
5,Excellent lab supplement,This laboratory atlas is very helpful for a beginning Microbiology class. The slide pictures are very clear and all of the explanations of organisms and experiments are very easy to understand. I already recommended this book to some of my classmates.
4,Microbiology: photographic atlas for the laboratory,very helpful in my labs as it explains purpose and outcomes as well as possible pitfalls to watch for. would recommend this for anyone taking microbiology with a lab
4,I sure loved em,"Yes, I purchased these sneakers years ago, I had the lime green and brown leather ones...they were so cute and got plenty of compliments from guys and girls. In fact, I have been trying to get my hands on them once more. I gave 4 stars b/c this shoe had no real arch support and the bottoms seemed narrow, bottoms as in the actual rubber part of the sole that hits the ground when you walk... I have flat feet (as long as I wore jeans that are long enough w/ them, it didn't look odd)so...final thoughts, they were and are still fly (means nice)."
5,Nice and inexpensive,This tail light was a good fit on a 1997 Chevy Cheyenne K2500. I would recommend this product to replace rather than trying to restore old faded tail light. For 15 bucks you can't go wrong!
1,The tail light shown does not fit all 1999 Chevrolet C2500's,"If you are considering this tail light from this company, don't go there. The tail lights I purchased didn't fit so, at their request, I got my Chevrolet Dealer to give me a OEM number (not a real pleasant job) only to be told ""We don't have a tail light that fits your truck"". Their selection system will lead you to this tail light if you type in the proper description for this vehicle and their product will not fit your vehicle. I told them their system does this, but they have not change it. Their service was quick enough but the results were very poor."
5,perfect fit on '95 chevy shortbed,perfect fit would purchase these again to replace faded out taillights easy and quick to install highly recommend cheaper than LMC Truck
4,The price was right...,"It looked good and fit properly, I gave four stars only because it seemed to be made of lighter-than-original GM material which it was, I guess, but for the price what do you expect?"
2,"""Not good for hard steel""","I made a mistake a hit a GR5 screw, the blade went dull instantly. You may want to invest in a better blade with carbide, of course it may be a much higher cost. This blade seemed OK for mild steel and aluminum."
4,410 scope mount,"It came on time , I mounted it my self looks good and works great , good price, my son is happy with it"
4,Great Watch & Customer Service,"I have had this watch for quite awhile and really love it, I think the mio products are priced way more realistic than some other companies, maybe pro athletes need more but not me."
2,Battery Problems,After a year the battery failed. Installed a new one and it lasted less than 5 months. Only a fair watch/ monitor in my humble opinion.
1,Poor Quality Product,The first one they sent was not working. The second unit they sent failed in less than 60 days. Very poor quality product. Highly recommend you look elsewhere.
2,nice watch but...,I wanted the watch to monitor my heart rate. This is a nice watch.. when it works. It only registers the heart rate intermittently which is a disappointment. It does appear to be pretty accurate but again it doesn't register BPM consistently. Data entry for the other features seems like it would be a hassle.
4,After having this product for over 6 mos...3 stars instead of 4,"I've had this for a couple of months and use it each day while working out. I'm over 40 and had concerns about over working heart, but with this product, I don't worry. I gave it a 4 rating because there are times where I have problems getting a read while exercising. I have found that I need to push it up a little further on my wrist and then it works. I think you will like it a lot for the price.I have now used this for several months. It also shuts off after 60 mins. and seems to still have stop completely to get a good reading. I would probably give it a 3 star at this point"
3,Hard to program,"Whike this watch takes alot of time and reading to program, once it is up and running it works just fine. Use the quick start insructions instead of the very thick and intimidating manual."
1,MIO Shape watch seems to be defective,"Being an avid exercizer I have happily owned MIO watches for several years. I purchased and returned 2 MIO Shape watches in one week. Either I received the ONLY 2 defective watches OR ??? Nonetheless, I ordered the MIO Shape Elite and have had good results. Not sure what happened."
2,MIO Shape Heart Rate Monitor Watch,"I am disappointed with this product. It takes more than 7 seconds (which is what the manual states) to receive my heart rate. This is if I receive my heart rate, as there are times I do not. The watch will just default back to the time.I will look it over again this weekend, and if i still feel discouraged by that watch, I will be returning it.However, I could just be one of the few people that this item does not work on (manual also states this).It is nice not having to wear a strap on your chest though."
2,Expensive and slow,"This watch is much slower than the other Mio watches. I have this and a select (that I paid even less for at wally world). The select reads my heart rate about twice as fast as this one. My wife is using this one right now and says it is ok but can be tough to get a reading out of at times. All in all, I say go select if getting a mio. Also check around for prices because this watch is normally priced $20 cheaper at other stores and the select is $10 cheaper than this one at other stores."
1,Don't bother,We have returned this three times (We really wanted it to work) but have yet to get one that the light worked on. Since most of our workouts are indoors or at night after work the light is a key feature. We wound up calling Mio directly and they were good enough to send us a free battery to see if that was the issue. It wasn't. So they offered to send us a new watch. A CHEAPER WATCH THAN THE MODEL WE BOUGHT. Unacceptable Amazon..unacceptable Mio!
1,Damaged Goods,"I have just received my SECOND BROKEN WATCH - completely inoperable. Either MIO is dumping bad product via Amazon, or MIO has serious tech difficulties to get through. Absurd."
4,Thanks Mr. Obvious...your a life saver.,"This album is great, except it is missing ""The Service Call"". Which is found on ""camel Toe"".Also, too much of a good thing can tire pretty easily. I can only listen to it in segments.""Mr Obvious"" is the only thing worth listening to on Bob & Tom."
5,Jane Horrocks-The Big Voice of L.V.,Great listening. What fun to find another cd as good as the first. I would highly recommend this cd to all who enjoyed the first. Good music.Great song selection.
3,This is a better album than the other reiews suggest,"Not being a huge Thin Lizzy fan, I don't have the same impediments to enjoying this album. I know it will make fans cringe, but I like many of the covers better than the Thin Lizzy originals. So if you can get past the bad juju of the die-hards, check it out."
1,Please allow NO STARS for rotted cabbage,"One star gives this recording way too much credit. For years I thought that it would be really neat to emulate the Gorham/Robertson twin guitar duo, as well as the backing of Downey and a solid bass.Here, this rag tag mix of jobless 80's metal die-hards try and make a giant stewing pot of rotted cabbage. They have destroyed any chance of a real tribute.My guess is that the aging, balding lot of them thought they could grab a few bucks for m ashing out some classic Lynott masterpieces.Thanks to Amazon for allowing me to sample before buying. Just for a giggle, ya gotta hear the lead vocalist (I think its the guy from Autograph ((turn up the radio)) ). He pouts and smears like he is auditioning for the Mascara Maidens, cica 1986.Do it better, or mimic a master...... this crew from Barnum's sideshow does neither. They would fit better with red wigs and in the center ring, popping out of a tiny car."
3,"Come on, not so bad....","This tribute did not come from the long line of ""BOB KULICK TRIBUTE PRODUCTIONS"". Maybe that was the problem. This one was produced by British guy Lea Hart.The trouble begins already in the credits. There are not credits for each of the songs, just a general list of musicians involved in the project (from Paul Di'anno to Glenn Hughes), without telling the listener who performed in each song!!AS for the recording itself, they are not so bad, in the sense that each line-up (whoever they were!) tried to give their own spin to the classics, instead of playing safe and covering the songs exactly like the original. You will lose absolutely NOTHING by not listening to this, even (or mainly!) if you're a die hard Thin Lizzy fan, but it's not that bad."
2,ONLY ONE MERIT,"Only one merit in this ""tribute"": song selection. It really has on of Lizzy's greatest tunes ever. BUt the performances... well, just listen to the samples and you'll hear ..."
1,Terrible DVD on Acupressure,"This DVD is the most horrific product on acupressure ever made. It was short and not informative in any sense. Don't buy it... President Brooklyn Institute of Massage Therapy ( Brooklyn, NY )"
1,did not work,"The dvd did not work, no replacement option and I have to paid shipping for a refund. Product cost $4.99, shipping $2.99. Not worth shipping back. Basicly I lost $5.00"
4,Too Much Talking with the Other-One Inside the Head,"A good trilogy with very interesting mix of characters. However, characters talk too much to their (other)-selves, and that gets annoying after 500 pages. And, that (thing) happened to reborn is just plain stupid. Oh well... a good read non-the-less if you could withstand some disappointments in the storyline."
3,courage of falcons,when they found out they were going to die why didnt they have sex?? but i think these books are great!does anyone know if theres going to be the next after this??
2,This Is For Jewelry,I have a one man foundry for ceramic shell lost wax casting of sculpture. There are many challenges and opportunities to do things better. This book did not help because it is for the jewelry maker who is doing lost wax casting and not for the foundry casting art sculpture.The pictures and illustrations seem to be from the 40's and the book is for the person who is experienced and equipped as a machinist.
3,60's hit from the old gem and minerals magazine,"This is a grouping of articles that were published in the 60's and or 70's If my memory serves me. As I no longer have my magazines i can not check. It has been updated only in the safety warning area due to the asbestos that was suggested in the original articles. You really don't have to be a machinist or have a ton of tools to make the stuff in the booklet. You will need a basic knowledge of shop/metal work and have access to some hand tools, power tools do make it faster and some what more fun. To borrow a phrase MORE POWER!!!! If you go over the list of material at the end of each section. you will be able to come up with substitutes for the asbestos at your local ceramic supply. Also remember that the fire bricks and even the new replacements for asbestos have dangers. So take the necessary safety steps.There are a number of things to make in the booklet that are low cost versions of fancy items that cost big bucks.I own it."
3,Not for beginners - too many mistakes and typos,"I would rate this book 5 stars for the material. But, gosh, is there any Oracle book without mistakes? When would authors and publishes care enough to eliminate them, or at least minimise them? Even errata contains only about 50% of necessary corrections - after 6 months from being published.What is the value of instructions if you can't follow them?If you know how to correct them by yourself, then you can buy this book, otherwise it would be another pain."
2,"Disappointing, full of errors",This book has almost one error per page which is much too high for a technical book. It is unfortunate that the authors did not put in the effort to proof read the book and to check their solutions. It is interesting to note that the solutions on the web site are not consistent with the exercises in the book.I wonder how the authors authors keep their real jobs if their attention to detail is the same as demonstrated in this book.
2,not the best,"The play has very strong actors, but the performance left a lot to be desired especially by Dustin Hoffman. Lee J. Cobb gave a better performance and his fellow actors. Hoffman's portrayal of the main character, Willie Loman leaves you with questions about what is actually going on. The play with Cobb is clear and to the point. I really enjoyed watching the play more and came away seeing why the play is such a classic."
5,Treasure Hunt I Spy,I boought this for one of my granddaughters. She has always enjoyed theI Spy and Find Waldo books. I am sure that she has enjoyed this too.
3,I Spy Treasure Hunt,This is a cool book. It kept me busy for a long time. Buy it for your child. They will love you for it
5,"Great photos, the best I Spy","I own several ""I Spy"" and ""Do You See What I See?"" books and this is one of my favorites. The whole book is based on a model of a seaside village with each page focusing on one part of the village. Almost every page has the objects dissimulated in the scene. There are only 2 pages with just a jumble of objects, and even those are nicely presented (not just objects scattered on a white background) in the context of the treasure hunt. My only complaint about these books is that the ""riddles"" are not real riddles, but just rhymes. There's nothing to figure out. My other favorites are ""I Spy Spooky Night"" and ""Can You See What I See? Once Upon a Time"", both because of the excellent scenes."
3,I like see this item in prime ship,yes like to see this product in free shipping for the custumer a meanspecials customer
5,Graves on Genesis,"Basically, Robert Graves does for the 61 stories he finds in the Book of Genesis what he did for The Greek Myths. This time he employs the aid of an eminent Jewish anthropologist and Biblical scholar, Raphael Patai (not Pata). It appears that this is a little difficult to find right now in 2006, but the search is worth the effort."
2,Hebrew Myths,"I was expecting something more like the Greek Myths, which explicates the etiology and the meaning of the myths. This book does not cover the complete Old Testament, which was disappointing. It's more interesting as a step in Graves' evolution than as a reference."
4,They work,"What else can be said? Didn't break, makes cuts in normal (for a bandsaw) time. Didn't have to go looking for one around town."
4,Excellent book!,"In the book North by Night the main character changes from a girl to a women by the end of the story. The main character in this story is Lucinda Spencer, a sixteen-year-old girl trying to make life-changing decisions in the mid 1800's. Lucinda comes from a very loving family of a mother, father, two brothers, and one sister. Growing up Lucinda (Lucy) would watch her parents help ""run-away slaves"" escape to the North, never realizing that she too would someday have to leave her family to take care of ""run-aways"" herself. As she tries to hide ten run-away slaves she must face the angry slave owner Clayton Roberts who comes looking for them. Lucy must think and act like a grown up, if she wants to protect the two women and their seven children that are in her care. Through her acts of courage and sacrifice she too, becomes a women."
4,The people's Review,"The Book North by Night was set in Ohio in 1850. The main characters are Lucinda, Cass, Miss Aurelia, Hope, Jeremiah Strong, Tom, and Will. The problem is that Lucinda needs to get Hope to Canada for freedom. The turning point is when Lucinda goes on the Underground Railroad to get to Canada. The solution in that Lucinda and Hope get to Canada from the Underground Railroad. Treat everyone the same is the theme or moral of the story. I liked the story because I learned a lot from it. I would recommend this book to others because they could also maybe learn more things. I think this book will be read in a hundred years because it has to do with history that really happened."
4,Good Choice for Younger Audience,"The first time I read this book, I plowed right through it: Katherine Ayers is no doubt a talented and interesting writer, who uses all the elements in a teen's life (romance, adventure, marriage, etc.) to enhance the character of Lucy Spencer. For a first time read, it was fabulous, and I'd recommend it. However, if this book is read often - which in my case, it was, due to how much I loved it - you start noticing all the little ""things"" that take away from the book. The exessive romance is just that - exessive. It's a tad overkill for a 16-year old of that time period. And I find the book unneccesarily sugar-coats some topics. Other than that, it was a good read. I hope Katherine Ayers comes out with more historical fiction, soon; practice makes perfect."
4,Wanted more!,"I loved this book about a 16-year old girl, Lucy, whose family helps slaves escape to Canada. The author makes all of the characters come alive and I found myself really caring about what would happen to them. It's a good book about the horrors of slavery and those who fought for slaves' freedom.The ending was disappointing to me because I wanted to know more. Readers are left wondering what will happen next. I wish the author would write a sequel......."
1,paste,Dont try to fix an xbox just by a new one. Im not stupid but six months of repasting and heating did not get me anywhere.
1,"AVOID this item, use a ceramic based paste.","unless you know exactly what you are doing dont use this compound, it killed my motherboard when a little amount came in to contact wiht the MOBO."
1,got a bad batch,"I have used this many times & NEVER had a problem until now. This got real thick & wouldn't spread after the 1st use. Yes, I put the cap on tight. It was the same with both tubes. I will order again because this is the best...I just got a bad batch."
5,Great Stuff,Easy to apply and works very well. I'm glad to have some around so I can swap out my cpu.
5,Great!,"No problems so far, everything was as described! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone! The price was good too! Definitely a good buy!"
5,Its arctic silver,Really do you need another review to convince you to buy this? Its Arctic Silver....its the best thermal paste that you can buy. So.....buy it already.
3,Not applicable,"The paste was ordered because the CPU ordered at the same time wasn't detailed enough to describe whether it needed the paste. In this particular case it was ordered but never used. However, since it is common for CPUs to possibly need to be reseated, it may be necessary to apply the paste at that time.Tim"
1,looks like a scam,"How come it didn't come with a box? or any literature? all I got was the the tube in a plastic bag. I am pretty sure that this is bootleg thermal paste inside the arctic five tube. 9 dollar thermal paste comes in some sort of a container, I've bought these before."
3,Didn't help the cooling,I got this product along with a cpu cooler that turned out to be too big for my case so I had to reinstall the stock cpu cooler. Core temps were no lower with this product than the original setup. I later installed a different after market cpu cooler using this thermal grease and saw little if any reduction in core temps. Certainly there's nothing wrong with Arctic Silver but it didn't live up to the hype.
2,Sketchy,"The Arctic Silver was shipped to me from a Chinatown address in CA. It had no packaging that indicated it was packaged by the manufacturer. Instead, literally just the tube/syringe was put into an envelope with nothing else. Those are not things that inspire one's confidence that one has purchased the real thing. I used it to replace the thermal paste on my PS3. If it overheats and fails, I'll know why. So far, seems ok, but then I'm not playing games on it--just using it for the bluray player for a movie every now and then."
5,Amazing....,"Well.., i am not an expert in temperature and stuff like that.., and i didn't test the product with another program such Sandra (to say a program to monitor it) the only i can say, if that before, the monitor that comes with the bios of my intel motherboard, showed 50 degrees, now its shows near 45, and i can feel more fresh the air coming out of the tower, and i hear the fans working less than before...I think this product its excelent and at least do what is says it does...,"
1,Never felt so good to grease up some smooth surfaces.,"Yea my laptop cooled down at least 5-10degrees C after applying a new coat. It really didn't have anything to do with AS5, but rather with the fact that some chinese worker decided to glob on a huge amount of grease on it during assembly. It's good for marketing because then the chips burn out faster.I'd give 5 stars if they would've just sent me like a crackball size amount instead of a whole eighth, as if I would need that much thermal grease in my lifetime. Like I said before, it's just good marketing. I only used like 0.1g, which is like a dabsworth. A 0.1g dab will take you really far out, man.I only give 1 out of 5 because I didn't even use 1/5th of 1/5th of 3.5g of robot smegma."
5,AS5,Best thermal compound for many years now.Use a grain of rice size and it cools your hot overclocked cpu.
5,The best,Simply the best thermal paste you can buy. Easy to apply and does the job well. It was cheap too.
5,Cheap and great,"I bought this for the new processor that I ordered, I currently have on my computer and it lowered temperatures about 10 degree Celsius. Very great, buy this if you are building a computer with a processor faster then 2GHz!!"
5,Arctic Silver as Advertised,"I have finished my first build of a computer. In reading reviews, reviewers stated that the cooling on my new CPU, Intel 3770K, could be better than what came with the CPU. In going over reviews for coolers, most reviews recommended the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO. Those same reviews recommended the Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound in lieu of what was supplied by either Intel or Cooler Master. I did in fact purchase both items from Amazon as recommended by reviewers. Prior to applying the paste I was concerned about spreading the compound evenly over the CPU. This concern was in the end not warranted. One reviewer stated that he used a business card to spread the paste evenly over the CPU. The paste was just the right viscosity and it spread very evenly over the CPU, it could not have been easier. I wish to thank you reviewers and Arctic Silver for helping make my first computer build a success!"
4,High Class Thermal compound,"To be honest i didnt fell any tempeture work with that product, people says that is one the best int the market but i think is pretty expensive just for a 3.5g"
5,always need this,never ever replace the cooling fins without cleaning off the old thermal paste and applying a new layer. carefull about how thickyou apply it too.
5,Best Stuff,"This is the best compund you can really use for any cpu, gpu, or whatever else yo have that needs compound added to it. Used it in my gaming rig."
5,expect nothing less,"great product. keeps pc cool once the bonding is completed. overclock i5 ivy bridge 38 degrees going steady. I have kept my pc running guild wars 2 for 8 hours straight , no dedicated video card, my temp increase by 2 degrees. this is some real type sh!!t."
5,A little dab'll do ya,"I repair PS3 systems from the dreaded YLOD. The key is not to use too much. While the tube is small, it lasts for a lot of repairs. Also,the price is good and the shipping is free."
5,Great,"My CPU + stock fan would overheat alot. I had used the free crap that came on the bottom of the heat sink, and it didn't work. Rebounded the same fan with some of this paste instead, and average temp under load went down by about 8 degrees Celsius. Good buy."
2,Temp differences over stock were so-so,"I bought this hoping to drop my cpu temps a few degrees cooler, the website showed promising differences over stock paste. Stating changes as high as 8c difference over stockthe results are in. Stock paste temps idle - 29-39c / Gaming - 35-45c,Artic silver 5 - Idle - 27/38c - Gaming - 34/46cActually a little warmer while gaming over stock"
2,Worse performance than Cooler Master stock compound,"For my V6 GT I've been using the stock CM thermal compound. Temps got up to 80C or so at 4.6GHz @ 1.3V on my 2500K. 80C is a high limit for Ivy and Sandy Bridge, so I was interested in getting the ""5-10C"" drops other people are getting. The result: 10C HIGHER temps at idle and 3C HIGHER temps at load. I know AS5 has a LONG cure time, so I hope I can give it a better review after it cures. It's supposed to cure in 100Hrs or so, but review websites are finding it's more like 120Hrs+. Still, the stock thermal compound from CM has NO cure time, which makes it more valuable to me. If performance doesn't improve over the next week, I'll try reapplying and see where that gets me."
5,Best thermal compound!!,"I repaired my PS3, and used some standard thermal compound, but it was to noisy, at times i could hear the PS3 fan over my speakers, so i got tired and bought this artic silver 5, it just wowed me.it's a bit harder to apply compared to a standard thermal compound, because its stiffer, but man it's magical.My PS3 it literally new again, runs super smooth.ProsBest Quality out thereWorks better over time (the more it heats up the better and more efficient heat transfer)ConsTakes some patients to apply since its stiffonly available in 3.5 and 12 grams (would like a bigger tube)"
5,Now I'm cool..,"I live at the Caribbean, its hot here the hole year, simple facts:Processor i5 750 (quad) at idleIntel compound: 70-74COther compound: 90-100CArctic Silver: 60-64C"
5,Must have item.,"When I built my new computer I used a similar product, purchased locally. Big mistake!. I ended up having to remove the heat sink and the low quality thermal compound I originally used due to bad performance.If you don't build computers all the time, as I don't, you will want to include Arctic Clean 1 & 2 for cleaning up and removing old thermal compound.I thought I had done my homework when I researched the components that went into my new system. I neglected to consider this most important element. You NEED a quality thermal paste and the accompanying remover and purifier to complete your well built system. I learned the hard way. This is a superior product."
4,Great tool,"I used it to change the thermal paste on my PS3, it now works like a charm. It does what it needs, it is not that thick, so careful when you apply it on the surface, also the curing time is around 20 hours, Just let it rest and be patient."
4,Worked perfect!,"Bought this to replace the thermal grease that was on my 360 after it Red Ringed. Only thing I would say is be careful when applying it around sensitive electronics. It has a tendency to spiderweb and may fall onto the board when pulling up. But, I highly recommend this product!"
5,Artic Silver 5 CPU thermal paste.,"Use this in all builds from i7 to single cores. Have been around the block with other products of the same. This is the best. Example: My i7 950 runs @ 28C loaded. 35C with other products. The same with my i5 2500K. Granted I do have aftermarket coolers and they are needed. Arrived in perfect shape, packed well, and early delivery. Amazon is the place to purchase it."
5,Performs as advertised,"Been useing this stuff for a long time, pretty cheap and works very well at lowering cpu temp. No need to look elseware."
3,Big chunk of something,After opening and trying to use noting came out. It was plugged with a big chunk of something. After clearing the clog I found that half the paste was solidified and formed the clog. Still enough to use but what a waste & a pain.
4,Keeping it cool...,I always use this stuff to help keep my cpu's (processors) cool in my system builds. Being an IT guy I have to make sure I got at least 1-2 tubes of this stuff lying around to make sure all or my computers run cool and smooth. Kinda like this stuff.
4,"Good for older systems, don't do anything for newer CPUs","I applied this to an old Athlon 1.2ghz, temps dropped 5-10C, when appliedto a E6850, no improvement at all."
3,Does the job,"Pros:Significantly better than any stock compoundCons:Significantly inferior to some other 3rd party compoundsOverall:I'm getting back into the overclocking game after about a decade gone. I remembered Arctic Silver being the ne plus ultra of thermal compounds, so of course, I went back to it.It's as good as I remember. Multiple degrees were lopped off of my AMD Phenom. But I also experimented with other compounds after reading some comparisons such as the one at Skineelabs.Using a Spire Thermax heat sink, I saw two-to-three degrees Celsius difference between Proliamtech's PK-1 and the Arctic Silver. For nothing more than the paste selection, that is pretty significant to me.If you are not overclocking, this paste will work fine. Otherwise, I would go with another brand."
4,arctic silver 5,"Use on a core i5 750, the temp are at idle 30-34 and a full use 40-42 more or less. Great value, good performance"
5,Arctic Silver 5 Thermal compound is exactly what you need!,"It is 99.9% per silver which is one of the best heat transfer compounds on the market. When I buy a CPU that is preloaded from the factory, I clean it off and apply Arctic Silver.It's cheap insurance. That little tube has enough product to prep at least 10 CPU's.And its inexpensive too!"
5,Good stuff,"Dropped my temps under full load by 9c, I am very pleased. One tube will last a long time. Product works very well."
5,Can't Get Enough of it!!,"I just finished watching Vol.7 today. To tell you the truth, I liked it so, so much, and I can't wait for the next one to be released. I've watched all of the volumes till now and I sure will keep buying the upcoming ones. I don't know, but I think that I like Tsukuchi to be with Tsukasa more than with Rui Hanazawa. I can feel that he loves her so much, though he is a spoiled brat who got used to always get what he wants. I want them to end up together, but we will never know till the end. Rui is a good guy but he is better off with the one he loved and I think that he still cares for her and that's why he refused Tsukuchi, though he implied that he did so because of Tsukasa, his friend since childhood. Anyway, for those who loves this series, this one is a must one and for those who doesn't know about it yet, go for it and try it. Please release the next volumes soon.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No"
3,It worked fine,good item. i bought this item so one of my employees at my Tattoo shop could learn how to do Henna. She used it more on herself that any customers. Make sure you have a demand for it before you buy or it just might become another play toy.
5,Definitely the best kit out there!,"This is definitely the kit to buy if you are interested in doing henna - all the supplies are top quality (henna powder, cones, tubes, tube tips)and make it easy to get started. The booklet contains very clear information on how to mix and seal the henna and includes ideas for designs. The only thing that could make it better is if you order another design book as well."
4,Nice !,Got three of these for my compressor. Two used for the individual hose lines and then one on the bottom of my compressor as the drain valve.Nice but one of them was a LOT harder to open than the other two...
1,Very inconsistent...,"Boy, I bought one set of four and they were great. I purchased four more sets (16 batteries) and many were duds. They would not take or hold the charge and simply didn't deliver. Sorry guys, I can't recommend."
3,SOLD GUITAR DRIVEN ROCK [!!]?,"Surprised there are no reviews for this cd, so here is a brief one. Some solid guitar driven rock, without all the plastic sounding crap. You do get a great version of Thin Lizzy's ""Don't believe a word"" Along with a heavy version of Creams ""Sunshine of your love."" The original songs on here are great to crank in the car or whenever you need a big lift off. Would like to have seen this band, sounds like a real good time to be had by all."
1,WARNING: SOURCE COUNTRY IS CHINA; NOT DISCLOSED ON LABEL,"WARNING: THE ORIGIN OF THESE VITAMINS IS CHINA. THE NAME ""THIAMINE"" WAS MISSPELLED ON THE LABEL WHICH RAISED MY SUSPICIONS. SO I CALLED THE COMPANY IN SANTA CRUZ. THEY PUT ME ON HOLD AND THEN CAME BACK AND SAID ""CHINA."" THESE ARE GOING DIRECTLY INTO THE GARBAGE CAN; ONLY THE GOOD LORD KNOWS WHAT'S IN THEM.BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,Perfect for Mise en Place,"Along with the other available sizes, these ramekins are perfect for holding measured ingredients while I prepare to cook. They clean up from dry duty easily in the sink and wet, sticky ingredients come off without a hitch in the dish washer. The bottom of these dishes is unglazed, so if you set them in water you'll want to let them dry before changing their temperature. Otherwise, you can do almost anything with them.Other sizesHIC Porcelain 2-Ounce Ramekin, Set of SixHIC Porcelain 6-Ounce Souffle Dish, Set of Six"
4,Great for sauces,"These are the perfect size for sauces and side condiments. Would also be great for mise en place. A little small for desserts or souffles, unless it's for children. Also a good size for timbales. They are dainty, which is pleasant, but could cause them to be a little fragile. Quite pleased with them."
3,ok,"they look nice and work ok, but are very fragile. one of mine broke in the mail but i was too lazy to send it back"
5,"Discusses principles of life, living and our nature.",Emerson is quoted as often as any other writer or speaker. Not becausea few lines here and there are profound. Rather because he understands more about human beings and life. He is thought provoking and so deep its a joy to read the same essay several times. If people take the time to read it they will understand many things about life they can't get other places.I find it interesting we live in a period of time where civilization is far more advanced yet it appears Emerson knew many things society still doesn't get. There have probably only been a handfull of what people call Masters of life. Those people who had few equals. Without question Emerson is one of these people.If you haven't read the essay Compensation you are missing a very important classic which will speak to you like it was written today.
2,Elementary text book,"Demiurge is a force that you can influence it to make your wish come true. Prana, astral light, universal subconscious are other name for Demiurge. I suggest you to read Ophiel's Art & Practice of Getting Material Things Through Creative Visualization. Why ? Because this ""demiurge"" book for me just like elementary school text book. And that ""getting material things"" book is university text book. More detail, more fascinating."
3,clock review,I had the original unit that was US timezones only. Worked like a charm.I needed an alarm that worked worldwide. This unit scrolls through the world timezones in alphabetical order! A major pain. It also requires a lot of button pushing to set the alarms............
1,only for the techo folks,Radio shack programmed it for me. Friends who had atomic clocks and the directions couldn't even set and turn off the alarm.
1,WATCH OUT FOR MFG SUPPLIED BATTERIES,"Have had the item for a little over six months and had both MFG suppied batteries leak all over the place, In conjunction with the Daylight saving not working automatically I would recommend any other travel clock, Oregaon Scientific has lost the edge on this one! Difficut to set, not easy to program alams."
4,Good alarm clock but complicated to configure.,"I've owned this clock for several years, buying it primarily because of its link to the US time-signal radio station, WWV, maintained its accuracy. Excellent features include long battery life, night illumination when needed, and a small footprint for travel. The single and the weekday alarms are nice. The loudness of the alarm increases as it sounds. The alarm pitch is excellent for my older ears; I cannot hear alarms on many electronic clocks (or watches).I found changing options complicated and unintuitive. Because months could elapse between these changes, I needed to consult the manual whenever I made them.Recently, its radio time-setting ability failed even though the WWV signal strength remains high. Bottom line: I'll buy the same model again."
4,Does the work,"The installation gets it well secured to the banister, I like that it's clear, some times I don't even notice it."
4,Useful as expected; Some installation tips,"It does its job.Some installation tips to make the process easier:This is easier if an extra person is available to hold up the other end of the plastic, otherwise it tends to fall down, making it hard to mark/puch holes. I managed to do it myself:- I first stapled one end to the door frame/wall. A regular stapler worked but if your wood is harder you may need a staple gun (or just a nail with a large head would likely do).- To keep the plastic propped up I used packing tape and taped the top part to the railing.- I had to make holes further from the edge than the hole puncher could reach. A drill with a 1/8"" bit was very easy (just be careful that the drill bit does not glide along the plastic surface and scratch it). Also make sure to drill from the side of the plastic that faces the child (so the sharp edges around the hole are on the opposite side)."
2,Hole punch is worthless,"When I read that they sent a tool for putting the needed holes in the plastic, a typical elementary school style hole punch isn't exactly what came to my mind. We got a couple of holes in the plastic before the hole punch bent under the pressure my husband had to use to try and get it to punch through the plastic.Also, I don't have a typical banister, so the 1 inch along the top or bottom being the only place I could put holes doesn't work for us anyway. Since other people have complained that the plastic tears easily even with the hole punch, I couldn't even just use a drill to put the holes where I want them because it would shred the plastic. Now I need to find something else, and find something to do with roll of plastic..."
1,Useless,"The good part about this item is that it's cheap, the bad is that it is junk. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is just a plastic sheet that you are supposed to punch holes in yourself and fasten to your railing any which way you can. After struggling with this thing for about 20 minutes, I was not confident my crafty and relentless little one wouldn't just tear it up and slip through. Highly not recommended. I ended up getting a sheet of white plastic garden lattice from the local Mega-Lo-Mart, cut it to fit, and fastened with zip ties. It looks OK, and more importantly there is no way she's busting through that without X-Men powers."
3,It does the job,"This a convenient way to purchase the cheap materials that make up this kit. The ties that go around banisters were not long enough, so I had to double up and came up short. No big deal, I guess, since you can get a pack of 100 of them at Harbor Freight Tools on sale for $2. Also, the plastic material rips rather easily around the holes. I was trying to be rather careful and still got one tear."
1,HORRIBLE,I would pass on this product at all costs. It's flimsy and is better suited to cover schoolbooks IMO. It is blatantly false advertising. Spend the extra 15 minutes and 5 bucks more to buy plexiglas at your local Home Depot or Lowes. Awful product.
4,Safe bannister,We got this because our cat had fallen from between the rails of our bannister and were afraid he might get hurt. Thankfully nothing happened to him except for him becoming frightened. I think this is a great idea but was hesitant about being able to properly install it.( Spacing the holes correctly and then putting all the ties in place). I did not think the ties would look nice either. Then a friend of mine suggested weaving the plastic sheet in and out between the rails on the bannister. That was so easy and it worked out great. It just took minutes and I just secured the sheet at the ends.
3,Stair Guard,"I got this to help protect my toddler in our new house that has banisters on the 2nd story hall. It works fine, but definitely doesn't blend in like I had hoped. It was difficult to put up neatly/ straight and the plastic is sharp where we needed to cut it. Still, if it keeps the baby from falling two stories, any cosmetic issues of it being a bit off is worth it. I like my house clean and my toddler tends to ""Slimmer"" the plastic. I likely would have gotten mesh just to not see that, although it does wipe somewhat clean."
4,Great product,"I got this item so that my small dogs can't go through the second story banister of my staircase. Originally I was a little concerned that the plastic would look tacky, but I am glad I decided to try it. This product was reasonable, and looked as good as any other option that was out there for the purpose. You see that it is plastic if you look at it and see the shine, but it is better than having an option such as mesh (my previous, temporary solution). It took people to install it: one holding the roll tight, and the other person using hole punch and zip tying the plastic. The roll was too long, so we had to cut the plastic, which was a little struggle to cut straight. Overall I am very satisfied."
3,serves a purpose,It does what it is supposed to do but it looks terrible. It looks cheap and my husband hates it. He can't wait until the kids are older so he can take it down.
4,Serves its purpose,"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this product since it was just a roll of plastic with a hole punch, but it turned out to be a decent fix for what we needed. I did not like the hole punch as we felt it was better to attach the ties in the center of the railing as well. We used a drill to make the holes in the plastic and the process was smooth. We installed the banister guard in under an hour. It's not the most attractive thing to look at, but it does its job with no permanent damage to the banister."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!,DOES ITS JOB PERFECT! YOU can use this stuff for some amazing things as well! I have animals and grand kids-and find i can never get enough of this particular product! Great on the open stair way-and still looks awesome!!! Adds that touch of safety!!!!!!!!! and PEACE OF MIND!!! Its more pliable and cost efficient than plexy glass and still you can certainly use it to a degree close to that! VERY good product.
3,OK,"Does sort of what I want to do, but product is just some clear plastic with a hole punch which is difficult to use, some tie wraps and a few screws. We'll see how long it lasts. Plastic is starting to tear. Needs more holes punched and more tie wraps for proper support. Ended up using a screwdriver to punch the holes (guess an awl would have been better had I had one) since it was easier and I can put them further in to the plastic for proper support."
4,good,"Good but a little too soft in my opinion, I imagine it might break where I had to make the holes if someone pulls it really hard. And the softness causes it to crease if you bend it too much. So far it works great though, and it's been through a few weeks of live baby testing."
3,"Beware! Measures 34"" tall! Not 3 ft as advertised!","This would be a great product if it actually covered the whole space between my floor and the top of the banister. It is 34"" tall and my banister is almost 36"". I bought this to prevent my child from dropping toys down to the first floor, so the 2 inch gap is a deal breaker. Not to mention that the description says it is 3 ft tall!!"
4,Serves the purpose but..,"We were initially surprised to see ""just"" a clear thick plastic sheet and a punch and some ties in the package. I don't know if fabric stores sell thick clear sheets but it looked like we could get these stuff for a lot less . But with a baby around since we don't have much time to do all the exploring before buying, this is a better option.Its little hard to install on the railings of the stairs. We installed it on the top balcony and it is serving the purpose."
1,Not a good product.,The pouncher broken after the first hole. Have to buy a new and cost extra money. Not recommended.
5,"Yes, It's Just Plastic, BUT","It does the job, you can barely notice it's there...and it's just PERFECT!! So glad we purchased this! We use it on our banister that overlooks our downstairs. I have 18 month old twins and I needed it for peace of mind....it's great!"
3,Not pretty but it serves its purpose,"Installing this to our stair balusters was a two person job, one on each side of the balusters. It serves its purpose of both keeping the dog from going between the balusters and preventing the baby from sticking his arms between them and also from throwing toys down the stairs. It's not pretty and it would be nice if there was a better way to deal with the two ends."
3,Kidkusion Banister Review,"The kit was complete for what was needed, but if I knew what it was exactly I could have gone and bought all the parts at a local home depot for alot cheaper. Otherwise it did the trick and that is the most inportant thing!"
5,He'll always be in our hearts....,"For anyone who knew of Bo (and if you have to ask Bo who, don't bother reading on) or watched him coach for the two decades at the Big House, you will love this book. This is a behind the scenes look at what you always wished you were a fly on the wall to observe. This gives you another view of what the man was really like. I actually read about some of the players I knew when I attended. Most importantly, it shows the kind of human being Bo was: the BEST! This will make you laugh, cry, and scream ""Go Blue"" with every chapter."
1,Cup hooks and wire?,"Hanging a plain wire from small ""cup"" hooks is not what I consider a hanging lantern. Looks kinda okie. Not sure if it would even meet code to hang a wire as they suggest. You would have to spend another $15 for chain and decent looking hooks to make it presentable. This is only half of a hanging lantern. really a ripoff. What you get is a light socket attached to a wire and plug, two cheap ""cup"" hooks and the paper shade."
3,Slightly damaged,"This light arrived slightly ripped and damaged. Since I intended to paint it, I repaired the small holes with tissue and glue. It's very cute now, but it was not worth the price in its original damaged condition."
4,Great CD,As a George Duke fan I found this CD to be a rare treat. The tracks remind me of vintage Duke with smooth piano rifts and great jazz sound. Jazz piano lovers will enjoy.
3,nice,George's voice does not do justice to his music. It wouldbe 5 stars if Dianne Reeves was the vocalist
2,Wire wheel,"Not ballanced at all...causes my bench grinder to vibrate so badly, I had to remove it...not worth the effort."
3,A bit wobbly but settles down after use.,Made the bench grinder walk off the bench at first but seems to be settling down after a bit of use.Very good at cleaning rust of anything as well as removing skin from thumbs!
3,"Deeply, disturbingly disrespectful of Strauss","Superb conducting (equal to Bohm), very fine sound, and a great, great Nurse. Empress is a judendliche soprano, very fine. Everyone else is forgettable: Muff hasn't any nobility as Barak with his colorless, underpowered voice; the Dyer's Wife has a crone's voice, with screeching on high notes to match; the Emperor is anything but a young sound, with wobbles so wide that time stands still (catch up on email). Even the tiny but essential role of the Falcon is entrusted to a soprano whose dessicated sounds will certainly strike fear in your heart but for the wrong reasons.Pity the conductor, orchestra and Nurse & Empress --- why did they bother? As for EMI, is it any wonder they've withdrawn from classical recordings with judgements like this?Avoid unless you've checked this out from the library."
3,Stick with Solti,"To passably negotiate such a difiicult score surely deserves praise and Sawallisch is more than up to the task. But this opera is such a case of gold amidst dross that it requires special and extraordinary pleading to make its case. Cheryl Studer is wonderful, the rest of the cast far less so. The orchestral playing is dutiful; the project also sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of a well. Stick with the Solti."
4,"Awesome new camera from Kodak, well worth it.",This new Kodak digital camera's color and sharpness is unbelievably crisp and clear. Includes all software for editing on your PC. This is a great camera to bring on a long trip or just shooting around for fun. Recommendation: Buy
1,Delta 4inch drill press,This press is the worst. It does not fit the drill press it was designed for. The mounting holes do not line up.
2,Drill Press vise,"The vise holds OK. The slots in the vise don't match many drill press tables. It is not cheaply made, but not well-made either."
2,"Won't fit Delta DP300L 12"" Drill Press","This vice won't fit the Delta DP300L drill press. It is too small to adequately bolt to the table in any direction.There are no bolts included with the press. Also, the casting for the base was very poor on this unit and would likely break if a bolt were tightened on the thin area. The box advertises that it will fit the following Delta drill presses.11-090 32"" Radial Dirll Press17-900 16-1/2""17-070 14""11-900 12""11-980 10""I will return it and try a 6"" vice."
2,Not the best ever,"Holds the work like it should, but requires a second pair of hands to adjust the position on it."
5,Inspiring!,"Finding your passion doesn't require going outside of yourself, but going within. This tape inspires the actions necessary to find your passion within."
2,NOT the original version,"This book is cute, but I remember as a child the original version and this strays so much from it it's not near as fun or cute. Still a cute book with more illustrations and has cranes and tractors (so little boys will like the book more) but does stray from original."
5,Little Bunny Foo Foo,Love the book-we have had the best time with it and the kids sing along with me!
4,My nieces (2.5 and 5) can't get enough of this!,"It's a great retelling of the classic song, with hilarious illustrations.Some differences - in this version, Little Bunny Foo Foo scoops up far more than just field mice, and he ""bops"" them with mud pies.At the end of the book, the classic song is given (with sheet music), and the actions are neatly illustrated.I love it, and may buy a copy for myself instead of just taking it out of the library."
4,Christianity and Cultural Studies,"In my experience, I have found very few self-avowed Christian writers who interact with cultural studies theory using its terminology and concepts. Warren attempts this in his text and for the most part, I believe he succeeds. He leaps off from Stuart Hall's notions about commodities, production, and hegemony to challenge religious people to consider how they interact with their culture. Although the title would suggest that Warren's analysis is limited to media, he also deals with the related areas of image interpretation and advertising to move people to think about the hegemonic structures of culture in which they live.The only shortfall of the book was the chapter on metaphor. Although this is an important topic in and of itself, I didn't think that it fit with the overall subject matter of Warren's text."
3,ex-Shalamar/ Soul Train Dancer Debut,"This is the debut album from original Shalamar (""Dead Giveway"", ""Second Time Around""..)member and former mid 70's Soul Train dancer Jeffrey Daniels. The album is a mixture of mostly electronic dance oriented songs strongly influenced by Daniels visits to England where at some point in time he hosted a ""Soul Train"" type music program in England. This album did not sell well in the U.S.,however it faired better in Europe where it appears Daniels career continues to thrive. He was also married to the R&B vocalist Stephanie Mills (played Dorothy in the Broadway production of ""The Wiz"", and had a very succesfull solo career on MCA from the early 80's to the early 90's with hits such as"" Never seen love like this before"" ,""Home"" etc..)for a period in the late 70's. For anyone interested in early 80's techno dance/funk will find this disc although ""dated"" in it's sound might still find it interesting enough at the going price."
1,What a JOKE!,"These books are ridiculous! They repeat the exact same sentence on page after page after page?? Are they kidding, why cant we just xerox the same sentence on 5 pieces of paper and have our child stare at it in complete boredom! This is exactly what I WAS NOT looking for. Try the sight word D.V.D.'s, especially the ones from Preschool Presents, they're great!"
5,Sight Word Readers,"Excellent books for children learning to read and memorize their sight words. Stories are very short and the children enjoy being able to read them by themselves. The stories only use the sight words and other words such as I, an, on, and the. I purchased these for my grandson and am very pleased with these books."
5,fantastic practice for your beginning reader,"This pack covers all of the best sightwords that your kindergartener needs to know before first grade and some of the 1st grade ones too... They are funny, colorful and thus very engaging. Teachers might be able to get the CD from scholastic which accompanies this set."
3,Sight Word Readers,"I rate these okay because I thought they would be a little stronger covers like card stock, but instead they are paper. However they are good readers."
3,not quite what I was looking for,"I bought this to help my 4 year old start reading. She can sound out words very well, but these books did not seem to help with helping her notice those words you just have to memorize because they make no sense sounding out - you know like, THE or HAVE. But, the books did help my 2 year old son start talking in full sentences. Before we started reading the books every night my son had 2 or 3 word phrases, and after reading the books it seemed like something clicked for him. Not a total waste for this household..."
3,"Nice quality, but NOT water resistant or sweatproof","The Elta MD UV Lotion SPF 30+ is a high quality product, but this should NOT be used for athletes as it's NOT water resistant or sweat-proof."
1,It does not work,"It is not my first time to buy Elta UV lotion, I bought SPF 46 before and it really worked very well in protecting my skin from sunshine, but this SPF 30+ does not work AT ALL. DO NOT buy it."
5,Best sunscreen if you care about your skin...,"My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen and I have now been using it for 6+ years. I can be on a boat in Lake Tahoe for hours or gardening in bright sunlight with a hat and glasses and show no tan line or sunburn. It feels great going on, is not greasy, soaks in immediately, easy to apply a light foundation over if desired and does not feel at all heavy. I have never had a problem with it stinging my eyes either like some sunscreens in the past. I have this great product to thank for my skin looking so good."
1,Allergic reaction,"Despite claims of being hypo allergenic, I had an allergic reaction to this lotion and had to discontinue use. I'm disappointed, the search for a body lotion with sunscreen continues."
3,Christmas DVD?,"I thought this was going to be a Christmas DVD of the Wonderpets, but the only thing it has to do with Christmas is the part about saving the Reindeer and the beginning of that story line. All of the other stories on this DVD have nothing to do with Christmas, so I was a little disappointed with that. Why make a DVD with one Christmas story, and the rest normal? I don't get it? Oh well I guess..my 2 year old loves it."
4,I wish they'd Save the Parents....,"My kid loves the this one. I really should give it 5 stars but it's just so tiring. It's all of the things a kid will enjoy about the Wonderpets...the singing, the saving of pets...but the parents may be exhausted by it all after the first 100 times. Again, there aren't that many episodes...maybe 6? I don't know if that is the standard amount, and I could just be overly picky....but I think children will just love this."
5,Two thumbs up for the wonder pets!,If your kids like the wonder pets they will like this one! My daughter watches this one over and over! The really like the Christmas story! The wonder pets have a cute story and good music. There is nothing to worry about in a negative way or anything odd or bad that they will learn from watching the wonder pets!
5,wonder pets dvds,"i have purchased 2 wonderpet dvds from amazon and was really happy with them both, we had to change the setting on the dvd player as we live in australia which was easy enough to do"
1,I don't work in philips machines,"I'm sure these disks are good for computer burners, but if you are new to the cd-r revolution like myself, don't make the mistake I did. Philips requires a special type of cd-r, it carries a logo of ""digital audio"" which should be located directly below the ""Compact Disk"" logo. Make sure your cd-r's have this on the package before you purchase if you own a philips."
5,rabbit pajama party,rabbit is having a pajama party. next they had lunch. I liked it because Rabbit has 3 friends over and I think pajama parties are fun too!
1,"Not believable, no character development","This book is great if you're looking for names of Boston restaurants. As for the story... no chracter development at all. The man she's sleeping with is about as three dimensional as a piece of cardboard. He's not even a cliche, he's barely there! Why would she go out with him? What makes her keep thinking about him? The author tells us almost nothing about the guy, his conversational skills seem to be nada and consist of very brief phrases. On the other hand, the conversations the main character has with herself and REASON, ROMANTICISM and her other little voices stretch on tediously for pages. I loved Bridget Jones, I love Sex and the City, I hated this book. Pick up something by Jennifer Weiner or Sophie Kinsella instead."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"The characters were forgettable and the plot was unimaginative. Very disappointed, the book was trying to hard to be like Sex and the City (and is not even close)!!!"
1,Could this book be a bigger rip off?,"Several reviewers mentioned that this book is a huge Sex & The City rip-off. I've never seen any episodes, so I can't speak to that, but this book is a BIG TIME Bridget Jones's Diary rip off. I'm less than a quarter of the way through the book, and let's see...a group of friends, all unmarried, JoAnne is obviously supposed to be Sharon. She also has a gay friend. Oh wait--and only one friend who is actually married. Although in Bridget Jones, that particular friend already had a child, and in this book, that friend is pregnant. The Mom and Dad who are recently separated/divorced and the mom runs off with an exotic, foreign man. References to Mr. Darcy (of Pride and Prejudice). The narrator falling for a cheating cad! Even the format of a chronicle of the narrator's year. WHAT A RIP-OFF! I would have put this book down already, but I might keep reading just so I can spot all the Bridget Jones material that has been stolen. It's almost like a game at this point."
4,A Realistic Romp Through the Life of a Single Woman,"Chamberlin's novel precisely blends actual reality with fictional fun! In contrast with other books of this genre (the ""Bridget Jones""-ish chick-flick book), the characters seem well developed, have realistic thoughts and goals, and participate in actual daily activities. Enough thought has gone into the process of writing the novel so that there's some meat on the bones of this baby--takes more than a day to read it, which, to me, means it's not as insignificant or disposable as other young-single-women's books tend to be. I'm thoroughly gobbling up this book and coaching the heroine as she missteps through her life! Also intriguing is its up-to-date approach to the plotline--this is the first novel I've read with a reference to September 11th. A wonderful read...it will be well-worn by the time it cycles through my circle of friends."
3,Disappointing,"I love the single girl genre, but this book was a disappointment. The characters are 1-dimensional. There was NO character development. No plot development. The story is about 4 friends, yet I didn't see much friendship. It's simply a series of benign conversations that try too hard to be witty. If you're looking for fun, interesting characters, and plot development try any of Marian Keyes' books."
1,Romance and Reason,"Overall, this wasn't a terrible book. It was a fairly quick read so that was nice. Erin's relationship with Doug annoyed me first of all because he was a married man. She was never going to get what she wanted out of the relationship because he was already married. And also because he obviously wasn't good for her and didn't treat her right. However, I enjoyed reading about Erin's friends and their relationships.The main thing that annoyed me throughout the book was ""Romance"" and Reason."" In every chapter at least once (and often many more times) mixed in with Erin's thoughts were Romance and Reason. It started on page 3 ""That was Reason."" It got old fast always reading the struggles of Erin's life through Romance and Reason.In general, it wasn't a badly written book. However, I didn't agree with Erin's moral standards and that made it difficult to read the book.I received this book for free from LibraryThing Member Giveaway in exchange for an honest review."
3,Bought this for someone who grew up there.,"My uncle enjoyed this book, especially the photos, which showed the town as he knew it, growing up there. I would recommend it to anyone from that area."
4,Feel The Tension,This is a pretty typical episode of Inuyasha including the never-ending tension between Kikyo and Kagome.In this episode Kagome is the only one who can save Kikyo and she does so but not without some hurt towards Inuyasha reaction to Kikyo being alive. Kagome shows great understanding and even Inuyasha has learned to be more sensitive to Kagome's feelings when it comes to Kikyo.This is a great episode that explores the more intimate workings of Inuyasha and Kagome's developing relationship and problems they face. Great episode for one who wants to see more of character development.
1,too much shrinkage,"This product was nice until it was washed, then it shrunk to the point where it is no longer wearable"
1,Horrible shirt. Not worth $0.50,"I bought one of these muscleshirts to try, with the hope of buying more. I was quickly disappointed with it when it arrived. I usually wear shirts like this every morning at the gym but felt the cut of this one was just strange. It just didn't feel right but that could have been the super-thin fabric. I don't think there is a cotton fabric any thinner than this one. Honestly, I could have bought this in China for $0.50. It is definitely not worth the rediculous Amazon price."
2,Not very satisfied,"This shirt has a very strange cut and it fits awkwardly. I am not satisfied at all with this product, if I could exchange it I would. I will never order this product again, nor I will recommend it to anyone."
5,Great companion to the Freedom From Addiction book,"This is not just another ""how to"" book. This book points the reader to Jesus Christ as life. Jesus Christ as our hope and freedom. This is written from Mike and Julia's perspective of their life and journey to freedom together."
5,Very good for the money,"If you looking for a 6 inch drill press vise for home use, or light industrial use its hard to go wrong with this one."
2,Poor quality,Jaw faces poorly machined. Many burrs that dig into the workpiece.Screw drive binds.No feature to quickly slide jaws to approximate positon before using the screw drive.
4,ordering data,This is a quality vise as are most Delta products. Before ordering be sure this vise will fit on the table of your drill press. Those specs are not available on the website....call first. When I received this vise I had not realized it would not mount on my Delta model DP 250 drill press so I gave it to my son who is very pleased with it.
3,Item specification differences,"I received this product today and what I received is actually not what is advertised/displayed. There is no quick release integrated in to this vise, whether this is due to a design change or receiving an incorrect item I am not sure (I have already contacted the seller to remedy). As for the construction: well made for the price and looks like it will hold up fairly well. I'm just disappointed about the quick release as this was one of the feartures listed that sold me on this particular vise."
2,Too large for 990 bench drill press,"Although it's advertised to fit the Delta 990 press, it does not. The bolt holes in the vise simply will not line up square w/ the slots in the drill press table. I can c-clamp it to the table of the press and it works fine, but no one wants to have to make such basic compromises with a brand new tool. I'm going to return it and look for the 4"" vise instead.The two stars reflects my frustration with the false advertising, not the quality of the product. I agree with the prior reviewers regarding the quality."
1,Weak design at quick release pin (see pictures),"I purchased this vise because of the quick release. Turns out that is the problem with this vise. There is not enough material behind the quick release pin to support the pressure the vise can produce. See the pictures I uploaded at the top of product page to see how this vise broke at the quick release pin.The machining appears to be pretty good on this vise, but the casting is rough in a few spots. The rough casting was most obvious in the mounting slots, but it didn't cause any problems when mounting or adjusting the vise.I didn't get to use it long before it broke. I drilled around four test holes of different size in both wood and steel. It was straight and true for the short amount of time I was able to use it.Until they redesign the quick release pin I can't recommend this product."
4,"Great storyline, love american indian backdrop","The first few chapters were somewhat slow, but is starting to pick up towards the end. Sam Casey speaks to the dead, but in this first book I haven't read much of that so far. Maybe there is more to that story-line in the next book. This is a fast read and I will definately read the rest of the books in this series.It is hard to find books that contain content about American Indian lore, so I will read more books by S.D. Tooley."
5,I Agree,"I read the reviews here as well as on other similar sites. I always thought that the 5 star reviews were just the author's family members pumping up the book just to increase sales. That is clearly not the case with ""When the Dead Speak"". Tooley weaves an interesting and involving story mixing excitement, intrigue and suspense like an author at the end of a series of books rather than at the beginning. I look forward to Tooley's next installment."
4,Great book,"Like the author, she keeps you wanting to read more to see whats going to happen next. Will read more of her books."
2,No chemistry and the plot felt forced,I found the lead characters unlikable and the mothers meddling was archaic. The plot felt forced and didn't seem to flow at a natural feeling pace. Would not recommend.
2,Could show some promise,though this book is poorly written there are some shadows of a good series learking through out. I will have to read on to see if they stay shadows or if they come out play on the pages in word form.
4,Hard to put down mystery,"If you don't happen to have a couple of free evenings try not to start reading S. D. Tooley's, ""When the Dead Speak."" From the very first page to the last this is one mystery novel that holds the reader in a tight grip of intrigue and mysticism. Move over Sam Spade, Sam Casey is now on the literary scene."
2,An ok read,"The plot was interesting...just wished that the main character used her ""abilities"" more often. It seemed to be a selling point for the book, but she didn't use that characters ""talk to the dead"" trait as much as I thought. There were also a lot of characters to get to know, but you really didn't get to know them. I got confused with a few of the characters and who did what. So, an ok book, but not as ""paranormal"" as many other ones out there."
2,"Plodding, don't waste your money!","I was expecting much more after reading the reviews. The story plods along, never really seems to get to the point. Boring."
4,Very good!,"Detective Sergeant Samantha Casey has a ""gift"" from her Native American heritage. She is able to speak with the dead. Not words, but images. When a man's body is found encased in a cement pillar in a burb of Chicago, she is called in. The dead man has a golden pin shaped like a lightning bolt clutched in his hand.Sam, with a little help from Jake and Tim (a boy computer genius/hacker), she unravels a complex case which dates back to the Korean War. The case gets worse as it connects to the death of her own father years ago.I did not think this one would be good. A detective that is able to speak with the dead? Never work! I was wrong! This was an interesting book from the first page. The case gets more complex than I let on. Very good reading here!***"
2,Mainly 2-d Characters without common sense or personal ident,"I was hoping for a lot more from this book based on the review ratings and was somewhat disappointed. How Sam Casey ever made it through the police academy is beyond me. She doesn't think anything through. The villains are smarter than she is. Jake seems more interested in Sam's mom Abby. The chapters are broken out strangely and there are some horrible grammatical errors. The overall idea of someone being able to speak to the dead is a fantastic one, but little is done to flesh out the concept other than some minor(and very typical) ""psychic"" touching of objects stuff."
4,"More, more!","Sam Casey is a wonderful character! The story was interesting, the characters (Jake, Abby, Alex, Frank) were deep and fascinating, the mystery held your attention until the last page. The narrative did tend to be a bit disjointed at times to smooth over jagged bits of the plot, and some of the secondary characters were sketchy, but all in all I'd say this one is a must have!!!"
4,Classic Worship Songs,"A very good collection of Worship songs from the early days of Contemporary Christian music. Great orchestration and vocals. Most of these songs are still popular today, though they may have been updated in terms of rythym and style."
2,No luck.,"First, let me say that the customer service on this seller is very efficient and prompt. Unfortunately I had to use it, twice. The first cartridge had a line running through the page, so I asked for a return call ticket and they emailed it right away. Sent it back, their cost, and waited for cartridge #2. Same problem, only worse--with a big sticky black line running along the side. They sent another return ticket and did issue a full refund. So they're good that way. But, neither cartridge worked, and it was a waste of an entire month to get a new cartridge that worked from a different seller. Sorry."
4,Daily meditations,"I am using the daily readings from ""Sacred Moments"" in my morning meditations. Many aspects of my spiritual nature have been revealed to me.I feel through my reflection on these daily readings I have been given the insight and spiritual power to deal with challenging issues that face me each day. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get in touch with their own spirit."
3,A Quick Reading,"This is a collection of relevent ideas. It is without conversationalist depth, but leaves me to sort out my own thinking based on a quote.I like it."
4,"Great watch, looks good and doesnt cost heaps","Going on holidays with this watch is perfect. Not only can you go out doors (bush walking etc) but you can wear it dressed up and casually too. Looks really good. Price is good cause if you get robbed its not going to cost you so much to replace it, but the attachment might sting for a while ;]"
4,big and comfy,"there's a leather backing to the watch, so that makes it comfortable. i was looking for a casual watch with big numbers, and a green strap. this fits the bill! great price too. very comfortable"
3,"Nice, but with qualifications","I liked the design of the watch, particularly for the leather backing behind the case and the web strap (metal watches seem to produce an alergic reaction for me). I was pleased with the watch's appearance, but annoyed by two things: (1) the web strap is quite short; my wrist is not exactly beefy (7 3/8""), but the strap would be too short for a guy with a big wrist; and (2) the case is really thick and heavy. You might need to wear it alternately on your right wrist to keep from over-developing the muscles in your left arm.All that being said, I kept the watch and would buy it again."
4,Difficult to read; but nice colors,"Several reviews mentioned that this watch is ""huge"", but it really is no larger than a typical sport/dive watch. What bothered me about this watch (which I did buy) was the magnifying cover crystal, which opens. The magnifying glass increases the size of the watch dial and numbers, but also greatly increases the degree of reflective glare which, therefore, makes the watch more difficult to read. Also, the luminescence of the watch numbers is minimal; only lasts about 4 hours in darkness.Another con: it is too frik'n difficult to use the alarm because of the extremely small, tiny adjustments to the dial which must be accomplished in tandem with the second-hand meter.Overall, though, nice colors, handsome design, and the most practical watch I've researched to date. **Still can't understand why other reviewers complained about the size, which I didn't find noticeable**."
3,Pulsar Men's Tech Gear Terrain Watch 2PF3357,This was the biggest watch I ever seen! I wasn't aware of the magnifing glass covering the face of the watch. H-u-u-u-u-u-g-g-g-g-e-e-e!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Bike!,"This Bike is great! I have 3 children who love to go on bike rides. My youngest, at 2 1/2, could not keep up and hated sitting in her stroller. This bike allows us to keep up with the older kids. She loves it and I'm constantly getting compliments on it. It is well worth the money."
3,Not for a petite child.,"My daughter is 27 months old, 33 inches tall and can barely touch the pedals. I bought this trike for her at Easter (then 20 months) and she couldn't touch the pedals at all. So for 7 months we have been using Mom and Dad power to get her around. Thank goodness for the nicely padded push bar. It can be a little hard to steer with the steering column un-locked and when it's locked you really can only go straight. The seat is padded which is nice and it has a 3-point harness. However, if you want them to learn how to pedal and they are petite, I recommend buying something else.As for my daughter she thinks it's great! I think this trike is great too, but I do want my girl to be able to use ""Girl-Power"" instead of parent power to get around."
3,only one bad thing,I love everything execpt THE HANDLE BAR WOBBLES. WHEN SHE DOSENT NEED IT ANYMORE THEN I will be 100 % happy.
5,The perfect first bike!,"My parents bought one of these for our 22 month old because she was getting anxious for a bike watching her big brother ride around at their house. This is perfect. She is strapped in, and we push her around in it, but she's still in control because she gets to steer the bike. She can almost reach the pedals, and as fast as they grow she'll be pedeling all over with her big bro in no time. The canopy is nice also, it gives her sensitive skin a little extra shade. We love it so much we bought her another one for our home! A definate must have for your little princess."
3,ok for price,"This product turned out to be ok for the price. I got a set in black and a set in the wood finish. The black set actually only came with 9 frames in it for some reason but Amazon quickly resolved the problem.The backs of the frames where the pictures is held in is actually a bit cheap and doesn't stay together the best.The fronts look nice however.If you're looking for a bunch of decent looking frames this is probably one of your best options, if you want high quality frames you should probably look else where."
2,"Nice frames for price, but...","These frames are a very nice walnut color and come in a good variety of sizes, but they won't accomodate photo mats. I'm not sure why you would make a frame that can't also fit a mat -- this was very disappointing."
4,Great for the price.,"These are very nice sturdy frames, the only problem I had was that one of the frames had a deep gouge which is very noticeable. They were packaged extremely well so it's not a Target issue but a quality control issue. Other than that, they are great for the price and I'm happy with them."
4,"Nice Frames, Great Value","Just got this set of 10 frames and have hung a few of them around the house. These are a great value. If you want something for expensive artwork, diplomas, etc. - you will want something fancier and more expensive. However, if you have a ton of blank wallspace begging to be decorated and/or a lot of great pictures you want to show off, you can't beat what this set gives you for <$30. These are sturdy, the glass was nice, they have a nice combination of mounting loops, and there was no damage after shipping. Would definitely recommend at this price. Might order a second set now, actually..."
4,Nice basic frames,"Good product, nothing fancy, basic frames, I put them in my son's nursery, they match the crib perfectly. Gave it four stars because the frames had a few scratches not very noticable, so I didn't bother returning them. Would buy these frames again."
3,Nothing about NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict,"Seeing that a Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany, leading to all-out battle on the ""Central Front"", is now firmly in the realm of alternate history, one would have hoped that there would be at least a couple of stories about possible campaigns in Germany. However, the stories in this book deal with things like an alternate Korean War, a clash between U.S. and Soviet naval forces in the Mediterranean during the Yom Kippur War, several stories on alternative outcomes to the Vietnam War, a Sino-Soviet war, and (the last entry in the book) a completely tongue-in-cheek story about a NATO plan to wreck the combat effectiveness of the Red Army. Fun, interesting and overall well-written, but when I think of ""Cold War Hot"", I really want to read about ""the big one"" - the clash between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Really for the hardcore alt-hist fan."
5,If your in Sales.....,This book is a must.There is a reason why this book has over 40 reviews and has 5 stars on every review.Its changed my life.
4,Good book for job search,"This resource was recommended by GeekMBA360 as an excellent source for job searching. Think about it, you are ""selling"" you. This was great for thinking about the job search differently."
4,Old School approaches that are tried and true,"Our Sales team was motivated to read this book prior to a training ... We had those who scoffed at the book's title, let alone the notion that they could learn something new about selling. An easy read [<4 hours for the slowest reader], Frank Bettger recounts his methods and experiences from a longstanding career as an Insurance salesman. Pertinent to virtually any selling responsibility, Bettger anecdotally recounts all the little things he did to transform his early, weak sales into a career of methodical sales execution. This is a good read for novice sales people or as a refresher to the hardened sales professional."
5,A MUST Read,"If you have to sell for a living read Frank Bettgers' ""How I raised myself from failure to success in selling"". I'm not easily impressed with the average self help - look what I did or those type offerings but Frank Bettger is the exception. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't read Mr. Bettger. He past-on in 1981 but his book is timeless and an easy read. More of an autobiography he writes without lecturing an his concepts are as important today as when he wrote them.This book was recommended to me by a self-made man who started his own business out of his basement and built a multimillion dollar business. The best recommendation I've had in a long time and now I can recommend this book to you."
3,"Excellent book, but this edition had printing problems","This is my favorite book on selling. The author writes plainly, providing clear anecdotes to illustrate problems and definite steps to address those problems.The particular book I received had several pages printed too lightly to read. Hopefully, your mileage will vary."
5,Excellent book,This book is a must read for anyone in sales. I enjoyed it immensely. Nuff said.Highly recommended if you want help in making that close.
4,"Timeless, Practical & Applicable Sales Advice","I bought this book in spite of a ho-hum initial impression of the simplistic & dull cover. You know what they say about judging a book by its cover ... glad I overcame that temptation because it proved to be a pleasant surprise.This is a really good sales book that contains timeless advice and applicable nuggets. There is a wealth of practical knowledge shared throughout the book along with interesting stories of how the knowledge was derived and applied.Even if you know it ""all"" when it comes to sales, this will provide a good review for you. If you need some practical pointers to improve your sales performance, this book will help you provided you apply the lessons."
3,the product is good,"the book was fantastic but I have a challenge,i cannot access it now and I had not finished reading.the access is dull.what could be the Issue?"
3,decent,Not bad has some good advice probably would be ok just reading the footnotes. bettger goes off on to many long stories.
5,Timelessnes of a unique wisdom and craft,"My initial contact with Bettger's wisdom was some 27 years ago through an audiotape version of his book. Now, I've been reacquainted with the man through his book. What a timeless nugget of wisdom! This book,in its virtuous compactness, has turned out to be The BEST book from which I've learned much that is priceless in effective communications (sales). In fact, it is so priceless to me that it has become a constant companion, occupying an enviable corner of my briefcase. I recommend this book very, very highly to any serious-minded sales/communications apprentice, anywhere, anytime. Read, re-read, internalize, practice, and watch the positive results materialize, inexorably!! Things (generations, perceptions and culture) may change, yet there appears to be a constant theme and thread common to them all. This book, in my opinion, transcends those boundaries..."
4,An old story brings new motivation,"While this book was written a very long time ago, the tale and techniques are timeless in motivating any individual in ways to gain success in their newfound sales career, regardless of product. But it is of particular benefit to those in Financial Services.The ideas and stories are timeless and are a particularly beneficial way to look at the power of persistence after you have made a career change.Raise your eyes and realize that if you keep going, you'll eventually get to the finish line."
5,One of the Best in Sales and Psycology of Business People,"This is a great book. I read many business books ranging from Marketing, to sales, to managment to finance, and this book was one of the easiest and interesting to read. I think I read it in record time. Learned a lot about selling and how to persuade people in business. This book is a Must Must for a person in sales and a great help to those that deal with Marketing or even Management. I suggest this book to everyone I meet in the business world and so far no complaints."
5,You don't even have to be in sales to gain from this book.,"This was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It is such a pleasure to get good, practical, workable information in such an easy-to-read format. Bettger's story is filled with excellent illustrations of some of the most powerful principles from Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People. And Dale Carnegie wrote a glowing introduction to Bettger's book.As the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, I'm expert on self-help, and I can tell you without any reservations that Bettger's book will help you deal with people better. And if you're in sales, I don't see how it could possibly do anything but increase your income. I recommend it highly."
5,Motivational,Wonderful book helping anyone in a sales profession be inspired and motivated to press through the tough times and rise to the the top.
5,Timeless advice !,"Excellent, clear , to the point advice on the ""real deal""! This guys ""been there done it"". Proof positive that a "" go get what you want"" attitude can take you where ever you wish your life to go.Either give up and get a job as a clerk or ""go get"" and live the life of your dreams... Your choice ! You'll know what I mean after you've read the book.All the best,Dave Wacholtz"
5,Outstanding,"While I was reading this book, I had to keep reminding myself that it was written in the 1940's, and that the author passed away more than 20 years ago. It's clear from the first chapter that the world of sales hasn't changed much in the past 50 years. Every chapter has relevant, helpful advice on how to deal with common problems we encounter in sales. Even non-sales types can benefit tremendously from this book because it emphasizes relationships with people, not just making sales. This ranks up there with ""The Richest Man in Babylon."" Seriously, it's that good."
5,One of the most significant books of all,"It's taken me over 40 years to have even heard of this marvelous treatise on salesmanship. I just can't believe it!! It is a classic that can only be summed up in the forward to the book by Dale Carnegie, ""The most helpful and inspiring book on salesmanship that I have ever read."" It is must reading for ANYONE in or contemplating a career in sales. Moreover, it is simply a very sensible method of how to engage others."
1,How I raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling,"I chose this rating because this book has not yet been delivered to me. Realizing it is the holidays, I gave ample time to receive it. Time for it's delivery has past. Receivng this book would be greatly appreciated. At this time a proper review cannot be had to my satisfaction."
2,Mislead by reviews,"Ok, let me be honest with you guys. Out of all the tips within this book, maybe only two would be helpful. Considering this book was published in the 80's, the methods used are mostly outdated (IMHO), it is 2010 now, 30 years later. The author of the book narrates what he does throughout his selling career which was probably sometime in the 1940's.If you're not selling life insurance, this book would do you little help. I really thought that this book would be great considering all the great reviews it had. But I was wrong.Hope this review would help YOU guys, not be mislead by the reviews."
2,Rather poor from today's perspective,"This book may have been modern and a real guideline when it came out. From a today's perspective, this is well-known stuff even for junior salesforces."
1,Why did I waste my time?,"This was an impulse buy. I was told by my colleages that if I wanted to sell great, then this was the book to do that. I have rad this book and I am still not selling."
4,Back to basics,"This book offers up timeless advice for sales professionals. The world has changed quite a bit since this book was written, but the basic principles of persuasion still ring true!"
1,Aggravating !,"I've had nothing but bad experience with this phone. It froze up like an old computer all the time. I couldnt even turn it off, I had to take off the battery to turn it off then back on.Definitely not a fan of this phone!"
4,Price justified only if the product lasts,"I hope you agree with me when I say that most men handle tripod roughly. And why not? Tripods are meant to stand on the elements. Water, sand, hot stone....But the good news is that most tripods are built to withstand this kind of abuse. But what about the tripod strap? Will it stand the abuse too?I don't know, but for the price I paid for this Op/Tech strap, it better last me long. Otherwise I am quite happy with the product although it takes a little effort to get the padded portion correctly over the shoulder. And getting the straps twisted in the wrong directions happens quite frequently. Not sure if they could have made a better system, but nevertheless I am satisfied."
3,Volo az 504.,"Esta camciòn y el album desde hacia tiempo los estaba buscando, las demàs canciones estan pasables tambièn."
2,Don't waste your time.,Psychotic book. A vile man's attempt to deny God. Book has no conclusion. Except there is no god but himself.
5,Actual literature in 2005,"If books were sold according to how good they were, you'd have to lay out at least a hundred bucks for this sucker. Fortunately that's not the case. Not a fast paced thriller, this book takes the time to do it right. The one big disadvantage you'll suffer from if you read it is that most everything else you've ever read (and probably ever will read)is going to seem like cheap junk. That's OK, that devilish little bargain is well worth it.I'll leave it to other reviewers to spoil the plot for you."
1,Bad vacuum cleaner! Sucktion was lost after 1day of usage,"It was OK when I got it, but soon stopped working after overheating and then when cooled down and started working again, it lost sucktion. Bad product!"
1,WARNING - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I used this vacuum for the first time and noticed it had virtually no suction power. Used it approximately 4 times doing light vacuuming. The last time I used it, it emitted a burning smell, made a horrible noise and kicked off. It has never worked again. I have checked to make absolutely I didn't run over something, which I didn't. And of course, since I owned it for barely over 30 days, Amazon would not refund my money. THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF $90.00."
2,Not much better than an old broom,"Don't waste your money, after less than a year, I'm shopping for a vacuum again. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money and buy something that actually works."
5,Great Vacuum for a Great Price!,"Like the person who reviewed this item before me, I just received my Eureka 5550A and eagerly put it to work. Also like them, I had NO idea my carpets were that full of hair and dirt. How embarrassing! Thankfully, the Eureka 5550A was easy to use and amazingly powerful. I'd recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially if you have pets that shed!"
4,Very good vacuum for this price,"Just received this item and my first impression was good. The handle feels light when push round on the floor. It picked up almost everything; I never know my carpet was that dirty. There is an extra belt came in with the box. I am not too sure about long term, but 50 bucks were well spent at least for now. Other than the color, no complain."
2,disappointing,"this vacuum worked great when first purchaced, but after about 6 months it failed to pick up anything, I removed the brush and cleaned it, cleaned out both filters,and still, the vacuum would not pick up. the hose attachment still works very good, but not ideal for doing a entire carpeted area. very disappointing!"
1,good for three months then nothing,This vacuum was great for the first three or four months then it got worse and today just quit altogether- I kept the hoses cleaned out and the filter changed- I am disgusted-
1,DOES NOT LAST!!!,We bought this less than 2 yrs ago for a year and a half we had hard wood floors so only used it on 2 area rugs.. so this has barely been used.. the suction is gone and the vacuum is useless!!!!! What a waste of money... DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!
5,my carpets have never been so clean,"The vac does a great job on picking up the dogs hair I have never used a better machine.With the extra long power cord you can do so much more of the house without searching to plug back in, a very important feature.The front of the vac is very low great for getting under your stuff.For this price it is a steal."
2,great-for 3 months,"This vacuum was great for about 3 months. I rely heavily on the attached hose. The hose is useless now. Had incredible suction in the beginning. It has hardly any suction at all now. Doesn't pick up much at all. I checked the passages and nothing appears blocked. Also, as I was vacuuming one day (not with the hose), the vacuum quit working entirely. I thought that was the end of the vacuum. After letting it sit for about 1/2 hour, it finally started back up. I guess it overheated. I've had other vacuums before and I've never had these problems before. I'm now on the search for another vacuum."
2,"Think long term, dont get it","I had this vacuum for over a year. The suction is fine, but over time the noise level has gotten unbearable. The cheap casing around the roller begins to vibrate making sounds as loud as a lawn mower. If you buy this, think long term. After the 1 year warranty is up there is nothing more they can do for you. I recommend not buying this product because of the cheap quality."
3,Catchy Material,I wanna Be Rich was the cut a Decade ago.Sir Lancelot was kinda catchy as well.The Calloway Brothers from Midnight Star bring their Formula here.some things work some don't.it's always about the Groove with these Cats.their best stuff was with Midnight Star.but when they hit they hit.
4,Amazing with minor Problems,The book is a very good book. Recommended to anyone who needs a little guidance in life or someone who just wants to delve into something new.Reason for 4/5:The problem was the book binding was a little torn in the back and the top of the pages was smudged with black marker. The front also had a stripe of black. Everything else is perfect
5,Living Out Loud,"This is a very inspiring book. I keep in my night stand and I re-read parts of it when I want to create; my medium is paper crafts. It helps me to get going and not be so afraid to make a mistake. Just enjoy the freedom and the process, and flush out those judgemental, critical demons in my brain that hold me hostage. This is a fun, whimsical book, yet it asks deep questions and really gets me to examine what is holding me back."
4,Big inspiration,"I loved reading this book, it gave me a lot of inspiration and hope that I can be creative. I will be reading this again when I need some inspiration"
5,Laughing Out Loud,"I enjoyed this book so much the first time I got it, that I bought it again for an artist friend of mine. Lots of fun!"
2,Not What I Expected,"This book has some okay ideas, but overall I was disappointed. It's not really what I thought it would be. I was expecting it to be sort of on the order of Wreck This Journal (which I love), but it sort of reminds of a self help book."
2,too vague,"The author discusses some interesting topics, but I found the book far too full of vague statements about the usefulness of various ways of encoding XML and of database architecture. Similarly, the chapter on querying XML databases was enough to whet my appetite, but it was mostly on the representation of queries (useful, to be sure, but confusingly presented), had little about efficiency considerations (surely of paramount importance when discussing queries), and presented as ""algorithms"" methods that are so unrefined and simplistic that they're better labeled ""query methodologies.""To be fair, I haven't been all that impressed with the other XML books I've been skimming..."
2,Too much of theory and not practical,The book is kind of blur and not much indication on how to do it. It is not worth to get one actually.
1,Not novel,This book. Is what it is. The ideas presented are not new.It's full of code which should have been left out of the book.His writing style is hard to read. He goes off on tangents that make no sense.A very bad book.
4,Low Cost High Sound,"The system works great and you can't beat the sound quality for the price.I'm able to walk all over my house and still get great reception. The headphones are a little heavier than other models, but still comfortable."
5,Great Camera Case,"Great camera case for the Oly C-50/60. I like it because its very compact and doesn't waste any space with extra pockets, etc. I take it everywhere with me!"
1,a pain in the ass!,"the last reviewer was worried about dropping the camera while getting it in/out of the case - well, i got the C60 and this case along with it, and the camera did fall out, dashed the LCD frame and damaged the lens. this happened last christmas, 2 days after i had been gifted it! the c60 is a very good camera but i would try to find a more reliable carry case for it. (one you can wear around your neck rather than have to attach to your belt, for example)."
3,Its kind of big,"The case makes the camera a lot bigger, but it sure does protect the camera from anything and everything"
4,Perfect fit for my camera's safety,"Just wish had battery compartment, but does have room for two extra batteries on side."
2,don't,"the price was right, but the inner padding was always getting in the way and the Velcro closure Tore Off in a few weeks after minor useage. I ended up throwing it away within a few weeks of receiving it."
1,weight gain!!,"I used the Cellulean gel for 1 week and, at first, saw my skin was smoother and firmer... Then, I found it made me gain 7 lbs! I have not gained any weight in over a year (my weight is stable) and after using this product GAINED 7 lbs in ONE WEEK! A week after I stopped using it the weight is still there so it is not just water weight... I also noticed I now have a lot more cellulite than before! This is scary--the product not only did not work but had the opposite effect it was supposed to. VERY disappointed.LipoSculpt (which has no smell really) worked well for the abs but not for the thighs. The only product that works well for the thighs (but is sticky, stains, & smells bad) is Dermalin APG by Klein & Becker, which seems to have been sold to Nutrasport and relabeled as Cutting Gel. I will be going back to using Dermalin despite the smell & consistancy because it works."

4,A little to pricey!,"Inuyasha is a great TV series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. The price is going to be the downfall of this product. Fans of this show will be better off financially to just watch the show on TV or buy the paper back books for the series. With only 3 episodes per disc, you really are left wondering why you made that impulse buy to see if Naraku finally gets destroyed. Extremely addicting and fun to watch but too pricey."
5,Inu Yasha vol 51,"This DVD contains 3 episodes (152 - 154):* Protect & Plunder!* The Cruel Reunion of Fate* The Demon Linked with the NetherworldIf you are already collecting the Inu Yasha series individually, I would recommed this one. If you are new to the Inu Yasha world, you would probably be better off buying the box sets."
5,A PERFECT RENDITION OF A MASTER PIECE,"Shame on the review below. This got to be one of the best chamber music recording of the last 30 years. Perlman, Ashkenazy and Harrel put so much commitment in their playing, it would be bad luck to miss this CD. Go and buy it. I'm quite assured you will not only love it but cherish it for a long time coming."
2,Three stars that do not add to five....,"Well... Mr. Sobel said it all. I added one star because I did find moments of beauty. Sadly enough, only moments."
1,shame on Delta....,Wire wheel is so out of round it made my grinder and stand vibrate across the floor(no exaggeration).....How could Delta allow their name on such trash (that's justwhere mine landed)!!!!
1,Dinky Little Piece of Overpriced Junk,"The product dimensions listed only roughly represent the package size. The ""tool"" is only 7 1/2"" long. Not sure where the weights came from but certainly NOT from this teeny tiny piece of junk!!!! It would be hard pressed to outweigh a Big MAC! Actuality is that it is a little dinky dresser that can be had from Harbor Freight for a third of the price. Additionally, the packaging was so OLD that it was thick with dust, crumbly, broken and had fallen apart in the shipping box!!! Other than that...not too bad I suppose? ;-)"
3,"Sort of good, but not good enough","I bought a pair of these at my Lawn & Garden center. I thought they worked quite well for house plant maintenance. However, after very little use, the thumb lock, which I had thought was so great, doesnt keep the scissors closed any more; so they are sort of a dangerous eyesore."
3,Not bad but ...,"I am a gardening enthusiast and always looking for tools that make the job easier. I bought these and had to send the first pair back. They just fell apart. The second pair were ok, but weren't very sturdy. If you are looking for a tool that is ONLY for pruning flowers these are not bad, but don't expect too much."
4,Worth the Price,"It has worked great for me. It was easy to program and it picked up the time signal in less than 10 seconds. The base station lost the signal from the remote once soon after putting it into operation, but it reprogrammed easily and has been trouble-free since (now over two months). The forecasts seem to be pretty acurate for the advertised 12-24 hours in advance. Overall, this unit has met my expectations and is a good value."
4,Wish it had a back-light function...,This unit works great. the outdoor sensor is about 130yards from the base unit with the entire house in between. Reception is good and bateries last over a year. Just wish it had a backlight feature so I coudl see how cold it's getting at night without turning on the bedroom light. Alarm clock function is handy too.
1,don't buy this,"arrived promptly. Remote sensor senses fine. Main unit senses fine. They don't talk to each other, even at 6 inches. This is a rip-off. Customer service as Oregon Scientific is non existent. Total waste of money."
5,"Go, Myra, Go!","This is a very good Christmas CD! The best song has to be Myra's ""Frosty the Snowman."" If you enjoyed this song, be sure to pick up her CD called, ""Myra."""
5,Fantastic,Installed these to replace my smooth rear brake pads on my road bike. The difference was noticeable immediately. Far & away the best brake pads I have ever bought...Immediately returned to buy 3 more sets...
1,product designed by morons,"these are so screech loud regardless of the setup, caliper, type of rim etc. they are UNUSABLE. It is a black color in the photo with salmon color in brackets, how are we supposed to work out the color have you ever heard of red? you morons. If you believe other reviewers that these are great you will believe anything."
4,Excellent brake pads,"Excellent brake pads, I used these to replace Tektra P453 and these work much better. The brake pads did not fit my front brakes because of low clearance between the fork and rim on m bike, no fault of the brake."
4,"A little dry, but worth the effort!","This is perhaps one of the best refernece books on what is acutually going on when a ball is struck on the pool table.Koehler has decent organization, clear examples, and perhaps too much in the way of genuine scientific analysis in this book. But it is still one of my favorite refernces when trying to understand what I need to do to make the cue ball and object balls move in a specific way.Without a doublt it belongs in any serious player's library."
5,Comparative Evaluation,"I have a large collection of books on pool. I not only collect then, I read them from cover to cover. I go to the table and test every concept, drill, stance, stroke, and practice routine that the author discusses in each book. After all this reading and studying I have come to the conclusion that Jack Koehler's book THE SCIENCE OF POCKET BILLIARDS is the best book ever published on the subject of pool.Since I have all this pool knowledge all my pool friends come to me for advice about various aspects of pool. If the question is about bank shots, I refer them to Jack's book. If the question is about deflection, I refer them to Jack's book. If the question is about rail shots, combination shots, or practically anything else about pool, I refer them to Jack's book. In summary, the answer to practically any pool related question can be found in the book THE SCIENCE OF POCKET BILLIARDS."
5,BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK BOOK,"I can't say enough about this book. I am willing to bet that there is more accurate information in this book about bank shots than there is in all the other pool books combined. The same is true for rail-shots, deflection, English, and many other aspects of pool. Like the laws of physics, the principals of pool will never change. I expect to keep this book in the family (and treat it as an heirloom) for many generations to come. Buying this book is a winning proposition."
5,"Stop ""monk""ing around and learn the game","After reading many billiards books that are filled with an over abundance of subjective pseudo-psychology it's nice to see one that concentrates on the facts. The psychology behind the game is very critical, but I've spent good money on books that were too long on the mambo jumbo and too short on the facts. If you want to understand what's happening on the table and how you are making it happen (or not)this is the book for you."
4,Pocket Billiards From a Different Angle,"As other reviewers indicated this book approaches pocket billiards from a scientific perspective which to me is good. There are many detailed graphs and tables which certainly no one is expected to memorize. However, these aids give you a good visual feel for what to expect as the many variable of the game come into play. One area that this book covers in detail is collision-induced throw which comes into play with every shot that has ball english on it. Graphs show the throw angle under all different kinds of conditions. This book covers all aspects of the game and has brought out some shooting techniques that I did not find in other sources. However, like any subject one should not limit their learning materials to a single source as there are several good books that covers this subject. But do add this book to your collection as it is complete, detailed, and has great graphical representations of what is being described in the text."
4,helpful,"This book is helpful for those who have a good conversational grasp of Mandarin Chinese and can read some. It seems like after studying for several years one can reach a plateau that is difficult to overcome. This book is a careful selection from Mainland news papers. It is already out of date though with respect to the social environment in China. Overall, it is helpful to keep moving forward."
3,Acceptable,"The book is satisfactory for those who have reached at least an intermediate level of Chinese proficiency. The articles are generally interesting or as best a language textbook can be. It has heft for sure and the topics contained are varied for a good smattering of vocab. On the other hand I find its definitions for words lacking, often giving only a couple English words and no Chinese definition. Its explanation of grammar is also less than satisfactory I feel.Given the varied nature of the articles and the style with which they are presented I feel it is satisfactory but I say this with caveats considering its less than stellar presentation of the ""meat and potatoes"" of language learning."
3,MY REQUIREMENT OF GRINDING WHEEL,"I need the following WHITE ALUMINIUM OXIDE WHEELS on a regular basis.THe outer surface is GRANULLATED SURFACE.I AM NOT AWARE OF THE TECHNICAL NAME.The purpose is grinding synthetic rubber rollers to get a smooth finish.THe sizes required are:INNER DIA OUTER DIA THICKNESS(WIDTH) MM1. 95 230 252. 150 250 150Kindly quote PRICE & DELIVERY time, immediately.IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE PRODUCT- SUGGEST A GOOD MANUFACTURER!"
3,Good Combo,This is a good light-action set up for the money. No problems yet...pulled in a 2 lb bass with no problems.
5,Fantastic Science Fiction Book for Teenagers and Adults,"Although this book is mostly aimed at teenagers, adults would also enjoy it. I read it when I was 12 and loved it. Very suspenseful with a fantastic ending. Upon re-reading it as an adult, I still enjoyed it."
5,Excellent read...,I recommend this to anyone interested in Zen Buddhism. It lays out the basics in an easy to read manner.
1,Not Worth It!!!,"This bracelet is not worth it!!I usually never leave comments, but when i saw the price for such a simple bracelet i had to say my opinion!If it actually took talent to make this bracelet, then yea i would say you should pay 40 bucks for it. But it doesnt! All it is, is random colorful beads through wire, there is no weaving or color scheme to this at all. Those beads are even cheap. I make bracelets all the time and i actually use a pattern and have to weave through to make a beautiful work of art. Please if you want something like this just go to a bead store and buy what you need there! It will save you $10 and you can make it your own!!"
4,Drop Dead gorgeous but too short...,"I ordered two sets, the lanvender and the multi, both earrings and bracelet. They are absolutely beautiful, even more than the picture. The only complaint is that the bracelet is too short. I am going to have to see if I can exchange of a slighty larger size. Because of the size if the stones, it is not a ""TRUE"" 7.5 inch in fit."
4,Gorgeous Bracelet,"I bought this a few months ago, and I wear it almost daily. It matches EVERYTHING, and I always receive compliments on this bracelet. The only downside is that I work at a computer for 12-hours a day, and sometimes the pointy parts of the crystals dig into my arm. Nothing that a little shake of the arm to adjust the bracelet can't fix though. Definitely a must-buy!"
5,its awesome for the price,"omg yeah its great, I love the way it sparkles, its really sparklie, it almost mesmerizes you its so nice. People make comments all the time about it, and wonder where and how much it costs. its just gorgeous. It consists of smaller gems on the sides and in the middle larger ones, to make it look like the centerpiece its so nice!"
1,Very disappointed,Trinket that is worthless. Looks like a plastic trinket that should go for 99 cents. Useless product. I am disappointed.
2,Teen Dream,"I bought this bracelet for my over 50 sister, who loves a little bling, and Swarovski crystals are sparkly and beautiful. I was so disappointed to open the box and find a bracelet full of plastic beads! Very fashionable for a teen or young adult, but not at all what I'd expect for an older, more mature, adult."
4,Cute and sparkly,"The bracelet is indeed cute. The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is because in the picture, the bracelet appears to be equally thick throughout its length, but when I got I saw that it has slightly bigger crystals in the middle, while those closer to the two endings (clasp) are smaller. Still very cute, just a little different that what I imagined based on the picture. Overall a nice purchase, fun and sparkly."
1,Can't hear it!!,I do not recommend this toy - our daughter enjoyed pushing the buttons until we took it out of the box. The warning about the volume reducing once you take it out of the package can't be seen until you've already done so. And it's not a terrible idea - a lot of toys are so loud these days - but it's so low you cannot hear it. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!
2,He doesn't like it very much,"The phone would be nice for the kids to play with IF they could hear what Barney had to say and sing. The speaker is on the back of the phone, so it makes it look less and less like a real phone. My son does like the lights, and he likes to push the buttons, but he always asks me ""where?"" because he can never hear Barney singing or talkin to him when I tell my son that he is calling him. I wouldn't recommend this toy unless you don't mind your kids turning it into a throw toy or something worse."
1,Why buy it if you can't hear it!,"I was so disappointed in this toy. My son adored this toy in the store and when we took it out of the box the volume of the phone drastically reduced! I changed the batteries and still it was barely audible. After much frustration, I noticed a warning INSIDE THE BOX AFTER YOU PURCHASE IT. IT STATES: VOLUME OF TOY WILL REDUCE AFTER REMOVING FROM BOX FOR SAFETY REASONS. How unfair. This notice should be outside the box, not AFTER you purchase it. I am so upset. My son already forgot about the toy and pulled out his barney doll that can talk to him & hear!"
2,"You can play at the store, but not at home!","My son was so excited when we purchased this toy. After opening the package, the volume reduced drastically. My son got frustrated and went back to playing with his singing barney. After changing the batteries which made no difference, I noticed inside the packaging there is a note printed: VOLUME OF TOY WILL REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN TAKEN OUT OF PACKAGING FOR SAFETY REASONS. I was furious, because that notice should have been outside the package! Not inside after you buy it. So, you can play with it at the store, but take it out of the box and you can barely hear it. I'm returning it today!"
1,Leave it at the store,"I bought this phone for my daughter's b'day, it had good volume until you remove it from the package, hardly any sound at all, even if you hold to your ear, she lost ineterest in it the same day, too bad I threw the box out, it surely would have ben a return!"
3,Timeless Story Telling?,"These books will seem dated for young readers today, but they certainly reflect the time when they were written. The first chapter of this novel takes place at an airport, where the Hollisters are meeting a favorite uncle. Amusing coincidence reigns, as the Hollisters buy a toy snake in a gift shop, then discover their uncle's flight has been disrupted by a large snake that somehow got loose among the passengers. Snakes on a plane in 1967! The lack of security and paranoia at the airport is refreshing and charming!"
5,Couldn't be more in love,"This is the EXACT paper I have been looking for. It is like the prints that you could get at the Sears back in the day when they had a photo studio in house. PERFECT for framing, and giving away. Used it for printing a customer's senior wallets; they were a hit since I could have them back to her in 2 days rather than 8 if I had ordered them."
4,Good for the price.,"It's not the best according to rating. Though, I like it. It's a bit glossier than most luster. Which is like."
5,paper,I was encouraged to buy this luster type photo paper by my teacher.I hated the fact that the paper cost more money but he was right when he claimed that the paper was worth it. He also claimed that this paper would make my photo look so much better them gloss paper and it does.:)
5,HOtel soap,"I, too, got this at a hotel. Bets soap ever. Cleared up my adult acne. I can't believe a hotel soap cleared up my acne - I can't believe it was this simple."
5,Super Clean!,"I love Peter Thomas Roth's Botanical Buffing Beeds and thought this gel for a lower price might be good. While it lacks the slightly fun aspect of the buffing beeds it gets the body really clean without scrubbing. If you have any buildup of creams, lotions or dead skin a little bit of this cleansing gel sends it right down the drain. It leaves a squeaky clean feeling without being drying. It just leaves skin feeling like pure skin without a trace of anything. Absolutely no film. It also works quickly and rinses off very easily. I sometimes also use Herbal Essences, which is certainly cheaper and of course, smells good but it's not the same super clean feeling. This gel has little fragrance (just a nice hint of lavander) and is very effective and no-nonsense. I think it is great for both men and women."
2,Don't Bother,"Was hoping for a fun game, however graphics are bad, game play is slow, save your money and buy any of the Silent Hunter games instead. (review bassed on 13 yr old stepson's input)"
2,fun? what fun?!,"I would like to let you know who ever is looking at this product of buy it, well dont, you have to take a college level course just to understand how to use this ""game"", is more suited toward comanders that want to horn there skills, hence simulation, it is indeed a watered down simulation, military simulations, that is the real thing are not supposed to be fun, there supposed to streach your limitations on the job that you do in the military, not to many fun times in the miliary but who knows this may be the ""game"" for you, I gave it way after spending to much time trying to figure out how to what ever this ""game"" is supposed to do. and remember the front cover picture of this game is just that, its a front cover picture not what it looks like in reality. Yea do as you wish, wast some money on this thing, for thats what your doing"
1,Worst game in EXISTANCE!!!!!,"Ok, if you want a fun sea battle game, DON'T CHOOSE THIS ONE!!!!! Like some people said it is for college people, so unless you want to pull out your hair and go mad for the rest of your life, don't buy this at all!!!"
1,sucks,"purchased game downloaded it, game never worked, contacted help, the help needed help, on top of it all could not get a refund or even try it on another computer, thats it for me boys and girls, if it does not come on a disk i am not buying it, too bad the first time i tried downloading a game had to be a bad experience"
2,Caveat Emptor.,"The Amazon.com download for this product works as advertised with Windows 7 32-bit. With my 64-bit version of Windows 7, I only got a pop-up notice that a network connection could not be found, although my Internet access was connected and functioning."
4,Good Game,This is a fun game that was definately worth the insanely low price that I paid for it. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a low cost game to play that is tons of fun.
5,Excellent Simulation,"Full disclosure: I used to work at Sonalysts (10 years ago, now) and know some of the people involved in creating this sim. I also have a bias against games that ""simulate"" some things -- such as ""Golden Tee,"" the golf game -- in which the motions one executes in the game are nothing like those executed in the actual activity being ""simulated."" And lastly, naval warfare lends itself to simulation because of the systems used. All that being said, this game gives as close to a feel of actually conducting naval operations as one can get without getting seasick. Very well done."
4,"an obscure ""Best of"" with a rare track","This 1994 Japan issued ""Best of"" disc is not even noted in allmusic.com which lists Rhino's 1998 ""Very Best of"" first in their Dokken comp section.What set this set apart from all other Dokken compilations is ONE Song.the ""b-side to the ""Dream Warriors"" single called ""Back For The Attack"".That's right. A Dokken LP Title Track has not been featured on any U.S. album release or compilation yet. Not even as a bonus track.If you have this and the 45 that is the only two places I think it appears. Versions of this CD I think also appeared in Europe.This release is noted here on amazon and on www.rateyourmusic.comIt's a good ""Best of"" and over 70 minutes long."
5,A Great Read - Informative and enjoyable,"As a newcomer to NASCAR, I've read a lot in the last year trying to learn - books, magazines, newsarticles. This well written book- takes the technical aspect and makes it part of a great story. A MUST read if you're new and learning, an enjoyable read if you're a knowledgeable fan"
4,Outstanding !,"If you want to experience NASCAR this is it. As a fan, newbie, crew member, driver, sponsor, or owner. I felt like I was on the team. I enjoyed every page and wished there was more..."
5,When you think it's all glitz and glory...,"If you think NASCAR racing is just a Sunday afternoon chase-your-tail, READ THIS BOOK. If you think all the driver has to do is point and shoot, READ THIS BOOK. If you lay on the couch watching a pitcrew perform on TV and say ""I can do that"", READ THIS BOOK. Sure, you've watched Jeff, Dale, Rusty & Mark in interviews always thanking the crew back at the shop, and this book is why. What about the teams that don't have big sponsors, millions to spend, teammates to run with and winning drivers to thank them all on TV? They struggle furiously with raw talent, determination, grit and total faith. These little teams are the underdog in every battle, but they are the majority of what makes NASCAR racing interesting. Like ""Rocky"" or ""Rudy"", you just pull for them 110%. What a ride..."
1,This book is a bigger disaster than the Titanic...,"Absolutely littered with factual errors, for example ""ship such-and-such has no balcony cabins"" when it in fact does. I have been on many, many ships and when comparing those to the books descriptions, estimate there may be in the HUNDREDS of errors in the complete book. The ratings are also very uneven, as the author fell into their own trap of trying to use a very sophisticated rating system and then fails to apply it evenly. For example, one ship with small cabins claims that they are all ""suites"", and he points that out, whereas with another ship and the same situation he does not. This 600+ page mess, along with the arrogant ""ultra expert"" tone, when in fact I don't think this guy has been on most of these ships ever, really does make Berlitz Publishing a ship of fools."
1,Broken - should have listened to the other reviewers,"The package arrived in horrible condition. There were two boxes - one within another. The inside box was in disgusting condition, and was simply packaged inside a larger box! Obviously the souffle dishes were broken... Good price, but definitely not worth the trouble."
3,They don't stack,"No shipping problems, received six 8-ounce ramekins as ordered, but they aren't designed to nest securely on top of one another in the cabinet. Try to stack them and they'll lean randomly, and fall over if you're not careful. I mean really, how big a design challenge could that be? Otherwise, they're fine."
1,Six dishes turn to one!,"I had the same problem as the first poster. By all appearances, this item is advertised as 6 souffle dishes. Heck, the item number ends in dash 6 !!!"
2,8 oz ramiken HIC,"I bought the set of 6 two ounce ramikens which nest nicely in the 4 oz ramikens which nest nicely inside the 6 oz ramikens. Wouldn't you think that the 6 oz ramikens would fit into the 8 oz ramikens? They don't, now I have to order the 10oz so I don't have to install another cupboard in the kitchen and I will take these 8 oz ramikens up to the lake. I noticed many people having trouble with the stickers - they should put them on the box and not on the dishes, but I work with adhesives and the first tool you go to to remove something that is put down with adhesives is heat. Get the heat gun or blow drier. Gently heat and pull on the label until it starts to give and it will come off with the adhesive intact. Don't pull the paper off first and try to get the adhesive off with the heat - the idea is to remove the adhesive still attached to the paper label. Captain Ron"
1,Picture is misleading,"One would assume you would be getting six dishes as the picture shows six and the 4, 10 and 14 ounce versions come in packs of six. However I only received one and had to call Amazon to correct this."
5,Spineshank+Meshuggah+Fear Factory= Mnemic,"Let me just say that if you are a fan of Spineshank,Meshuggah,Fear Factory, or like me a fan all three of them then Mnemic is THE BAND for you. They are amazing I havn't heard metal this good since well forever. With a CD like this U can't go wrong. it is so hardcore and heavy. If you like meshuggah, spineshank, and fear factory then this record is your holy grail."
4,Pretty Good Stuff!!!,"There have been quite a few comparisons here regarding Mnemic as a Meshuggah or Fear-Factory clone. I really don't agree with that. While there may be some similarities as far as the Meshuggah/FF-esque staccato guitar riffing here & there, the comparisons should end there.Really, this band is much more like Strapping Young Lad, but less chaotic and insane (although, I love that about SYL).These guys are very good though. They have a good grip on writing catchy-songs without being too pop-y or ""radio-friendly"".I would recommend this to fans of Strapping Young Lad, Static-X, and Demon Hunter."
5,Mnemic's back and better than ever!,"With pummeling death metal riffs, start-stop arrangements, double kick-drums, and both hardcore barks and clean vocal harmonies, are all spun together through a dizzying maelstrom of technology; and, really, all the listener can do is hang on for dear life. Future Fusion Metal band Mnemic has done it again. Denmark's Mnemic offer a futuristic metal style evocative of post-industrial outfits such as Fear Factory and Strapping Young Lad. Formed in the town of Aalborg, circa 2000 the group unleashed its debut album, Mechanical Spin Phenomena, in 2002, through Nuclear Blast. Timely appearances at Europe's major outdoor summer festivals followed, and having gained generally rave reviews and a small but loyal following, Mnemic proceeded to record their second album, The Audio Injected Soul and now the moment we've been waiting for is here. If you like Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, and Meshuggah, then u will definately wanna get this."
4,This is real metal folks,"Hailing from Denmark, Mnemic is a prime example of what the future of metal could be, and with these guys in the mix, the future looks very bright. This isn't nu-metal or aggro-rock a la Korn or Linkin Park, Mnemic combines hard death metal riffs with engaging harmonies and sweeping choruses to create something truly special. Songs like ""Door 2.12"", ""Illuminate"", and ""Overdose in the Hall of Fame"" are great tracks, while ""Dreamstate Emergency"" is amazing to say the least. If you are a fan of old Meshuggah or Fear Factory, I strongly recommend picking up Mnemic's ""Audio Injected Soul"", it's just the right metal fix you need, and it will help you remember just what real metal is."
2,very funny,"Another side project from the ever prolific singer from Wheatus, This one finds him in very funny satanic black metal form, made hysterical by things like white denim jeans and pentagram trucker hats that are great satire on the genre, Very funny stuff and hilarious vids, not really much for repeat listening though as the tunes are a bit like if linkin park produced a Fear Factory record, but funny as all his projects are. Again though with his sides, no greats like teenage dirtbag to really grab onto."
5,Puerta para entrar a la iluminación,"Fue con este libro del Maestro Kuthumi con el que inició mi recorrido en busca de la luz, me encontraba leyendolo cuando un buen amigo me visitó y me informó que estaba dando clases de este material y de otro libros. Fue allí donde me interesó conocer un poco más de los Maestros y las leyes que rigen este universo. Te lo recomiendo, te iluminará."
3,thrilling; most extraordianary volume.,"in the beginning, there was no one to hold the story line. however; after the preamble, the verse continued to embellish and florish. the main character became totally embroiled in the battle of the minds. i was truly enthralled and mesmerized............i later fainted, and upon becoming revived; resumed my jouney anew.........as i sat thinking to myself, i realized the prozac had worn off and i was again most stoned."
2,Great idea,"This is potentially a good tool. Unfortunately the jigging for tools is unstable and not straight. In addition the water reservoir ""valve"" does not work well. I've used (struggled with) it for about 3 years and now have it up for sale. I'm a professional woodworker and haven't time to mess with something like this."
1,expensive junk,"The wheel that came with my sharpening center was so out of round that it produced too much vibration to even use the sharpening center. By the time I got it dressed enough to use it, it was half gone. In actual use sharpening planer blades, it turns to powder so quickly that it takes about an eight of an inch of stone to sharpen one side of one blade. Since the blade travels across the lower 3/4 of the wheel, this leaves an eighth inch raised area in the center, which automatically dulls the blade at the same time you are trying to sharpen it. Considering the cost of the stone and the cost of planer blades, you come out even at best, so it is better to buy new blades rather than go through the mess and frustration of trying to use this piece of junk."
1,Waste of money,"This is the worst grinding wheel I have ever used. The Delta 23-712 works OK, but the 8 inch wheel is useless.It simply disintegrates. I've ruined 2 of these now and will never buy another one.The wood shop tool retailers acknowledge this is a very bad wheel.It does not matter what you are trying to sharpen the wheel turns to powder.Don't waste your money."
3,Not Balanced,"The wheel was out of balance, causing the grinder to oscillate badly. Even after dressing the wheel I couldn't get the grinder to run smooth. The grinder runs smooth when the wheel is removed."
3,"What, no sprinkles!","This is a lot of money for your basic brick shaped like a doughnut! Oh well, I guess if you need one to get your planner blades sharp again, it's not too much (right! Keep telling yourself that)."
5,Good beginning,"I have been studying Swedish for about a year and found this program (I had the CD's) very useful, even though much of the vocabulary was familiar. The repetition is great but the best part is hearing the language as it is actually spoken (i.e. dropping the ""t"" out of ""det"", the ""g"" from ""jag"" and ""och"" is prounounced ""Oh"".) The CD's are also quite good about drilling you in the hard-to-get double-falling tone of certain two syllable Swedish words.I wish I had had this before I went to Sweden last summer.It is disappointingly short, but definitely worth buying."
3,Pretty basic,"I got Pimsleur Swedish from our local library, not here.The language material is well presented, but extremely limited due to the high level of repetition. The repetition is great for learning, but when you're done with the 5 CDs, you've learned about 50 words. The effect is sort of like Dr Seuss, without the humor.I appreciate the good timing, which gives the student plenty of time to repeat every sentence. It's also good for practicing intonation. But you need about 5x as many CDs to learn a useful piece of Swedish."
2,Weak for Pimsleur,"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Pimsleur Spanish... It's by far the greatest language product I've ever come across. Russian is also amazing and the best. I highly recommend Pimsleur to people but the Swedish product is not up to the standard of the others.It's of course the great Pimsleur method but it is too short and doesn't nearly cover the amount of material that would be covered in 10 lessons of the Spanish course... The middle 4-5 lessons have you saying ""I want something to eat"" or drink non-stop over and over and over again... It's ridiculous how little you learn in the middle 50% of this product.There were so many more useful verbs and things to be covered and half the product is wasted on saying you want something to eat. It gets incredibly annoying and then picks up the learning pace towards the end in a way that should have been maintained throughout. Overall not terribly useful or well planned."
5,Incredible!,"This is a wonderful premiere solo album for the Cirque du Soleil Superstar singer Francesca Gagnon. She's splendid in English, French, Spanish and Italian vocals. Wonderful album, extremely delightful packaging."
5,Track List,1. Dame La Fuerza2. Au-Delà Des Couleurs3. Occhi De Ciello4. Je Voudrais Bien5. Vagda6. Juste À L'Idée7. Que Mas Da8. Zilinga9. Vivo In Te10. Bella11. À L'autre Bout12. I Believe13. Mandami Un Po'di Te
3,Blue Topaz is Synthetic,The earrings are sparkly and pretty. It wasn't until after I bought them when I went to create a review that I found the stone is synthetic. So be aware.
3,Not as solid as it looks,"The stone is beautiful as is the celtic artwork, but the lack of weight/thickness to the silver portion makes it feel and look on the cheap side. Too bad."
2,"Very light with no backs, lost one first time wearing","Earrings pretty to look at but very light. A good price didn't matter since I lost one the first time I wore them. Earrings this light should have backs to keep secure. I complained to vendor and got no reply, not even an an acknowledgement or apology."
3,Celtic Knot Earrigs,"I recently purchased these in both the blue topaz and garnet. A lovely design and a nice size but a pity they are ""flat back"". Drop earrings sometimes show the backside when worn. If these had been sculpted on the back also, they would be outstanding."
2,My stones are different sizes!!!!,I love the earrings but one of my stones is noticeably smaller than the other. I don't wear them much because of it. Wish I could buy one earring in hopes of matching a pair.
5,EXQUISITE,THESE EARRINGS WERE A GIFT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS 17 YRS. OLD. BOTH SHE AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL. SHE IS OF IRISH DESCENT SO SHE LOVED THEM EVEN MORE.
4,Lovely...,"These were a Christmas gift for my daughter and she just loved the fact that they are her birthstone and of course, sterling silver. Nice value too!!"
3,Cute earrings,"Very cute. Not heavy at all. Fun pair of earrings. Good size for adults, not recommended for younger girls. Did not irritate my ears at all."
4,A Nice Gift,I bought this for my mother-in-law and my mother.They both loved it and they look high-end earings.The only thing I didn't know and I didn't like was they are heavy and it shows when you are wearing them.
3,silver celtic knot blue Topaz Hook Earrings,"This item was very pretty and the stone beautiful color of topaz,but the wieght of the sterling siver was very thin and light. I would rather have spent a little more mainly because it was a gift. For myself I would have loved them knowing they were a deal.Silver insanity may offer inexspensive jewelry,but cheap on presentation,arrive in tiny ziplock bags."
2,Don't go by the picture.,"These earrings look great in the picture but, when I got them they where very cheap looking. Lucky they where a gift and the person did not mind but, BEWARE these earrings are cheap looking."
4,really pretty!,"i'm very happy with these, for the price you can't beat them. i get compliments every time i wear them."
3,earings,The earings are ver nice. The only negative is that i got 2 sets and they came in the same jewlery bag. They were for 2 different people so i had to buy a bag to put the second pair.
4,Good stuff!,"these are very pretty. they came on time and for the price, are beautiful. i will note one thing that i was mistaken about was that I thought the stones would be set in the metal, like having a silver backing. but they are just ringed with silver and you can see their backs when you turn the earrings around. however, i guess this will let the light flow through them, which is pretty. also the metal is just a tad (really, just a tad) thinner than i thought. but i give it four stars because you wont be disappointed once you know what you are getting: very pretty earrings for a great price.cheers"
1,Cheap...plain and simple,My teenage son ordered these for his mother and sister for Christmas...what a disappointment they are cheaply made...came bent. Returning immediately. Buyer beware on this one.
4,Excellent speed and Quality!,"I bought this, as well as the trinity knot bracelet back in December as an X-mas gift. The shipping was fast, and the workmanship on both pieces were excellent."
3,Pretty earrings,"I bought these as a set with celtic knot blue topaz ring, where topaz is genuine, and I can tell the difference in luster, clarity and color. But still they are a very nice and well done earrings. Silver is very well polished and knots done well."
3,too small,they are nice but smaller than apperedneed measurements to go with those picsthink I should stop buying jewelry online
4,Celtic earrings,Pretty. Looked well made and attractive in style. I will look for more items like this in the future. Thanks.
5,Funny!,"HEEBIE-JEEBIE HULLABALOO is top-of-the-line Simpsons! The presentation is high-quality with an embossed cover and bright, clear graphics inside. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Great read in the wonderful Capital Crimes series,"This was another one of Margaret Truman's gems in the Capital Crime series. I had set out to read all 24 books in the series in order and was able to accomplish the journey. It was fun making friends with some of the same characters from the previous books. Sadly the journey came to an end with the publication of the final episode shortly after her death. I will enjoy reading these books again in the future, after a period of time has gone by so that I won't fully remember the story lines."
5,One of his best albums!,"""Creation Song"" is excellent. Also contains a great version of ""Be Thou My Vision"". Track #10 ""If I Flee on Morning Wings"" is arguably the best song in the album. It's based on Psalm 139 and certainly does justice to its poetic vision."
5,A True Inspiration,Fernando's music is truly inspirational and comforting. His faith and love of God come through in each and every song on this CD. His music will enrich the lives of all who listen.
3,Disappointing.,"The eyewitness views were not from the grunts in the war, but the officers and their views were biased."
4,Mooniversity,"More than happy. Book was great quality - exactly as described.It arrived a little earlier than had been forecast - but that was still probably 3 weeks.Books like this (out of print) are hard to get hold of. To be able to source it was terrific.Overall, a good investment from my perspective...and good service"
3,very interesting...very tiny.,"I am a moderately new Batman memorabilia collector so I could not pass up the chance to not only view but own copies of the Batman covers for the first 25 years. This tome does deliver as far as that is concerned. One thing I did fail to notice (I blame myself for this) is the size of the book: 4 inches x 4.5 inches! Tiny folio means just that. The art is still colorful. It is easy to read all of the print. It also includes all of the Detective covers prior to the introduction of Batman (which was really cool). The covers run all the way to 1963 so this publication allows the ""reader"" the opportunity to appreciate the transition of Batman during his early years. There is a nice, informative intro by Joe Desris. All in all it is a very interesting collectors item. To bad it is so damn TINY!"
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed and will not order this again.#1: The notebook I received was white (not black like the picture) and had a big black ""Xtreme"" logo in the bottom right hand corner. There's nothing in the description that says colors may vary.#2: The pages are more almost 1/2"" shorter than the cover and dividers (width). The edges bend very easily and lead to very ragged corners."
1,Musty,This item was listed as in very good condition. Granted there were no markings in the book; however the musty odor is almost unbearable. Also the cover came off the binding in only a couple days. I glued it back on with Elmer's glue and that is holding it together. Good thing I'm a fast reader and the material is interesting because the smell is bad.
5,A Unique Offering,"This is a beautifully produced album, albeit quite a different sound for Richie Havens...a full on rock band, with none of his signature open-tuning guitar strum. Still, the voice is ever-present and the songs are great. Much more of a commercial offering, but a world-class singer like this can pull off anything! Highly recommended!!"
3,Run of the mill WWII yarn...With some twists...,Simple safe heroic script. The writers enhance our concern for the three US Paratroopers by inserting key flashbacks that effected each of their lives. Predictably this all plays out in the final battle scene. Even a German soldier finds redemption. Beware ladies! Have your supply of tears ready! Produced with a low budget and reenactors there is a feel of the quality of a bigger picture. Makes for a good rental!
5,wish it was longer...,"It was low budget obviously but great story line. Seeing both sides view an getting to know them other then a soldier, as themselves."
4,Great action flick,Similar to Saving Private Ryan. I recommend this well made film. Equipment on US & German sides appear accurate. Enjoy!
4,Glad I bought it,"The first ""Saints & Soldiers"" was better IMHO. This one was good also but started a little slow. I watched it with my dad who is a war movie buf. He liked it. I would buy it again."
3,"o.k., but not as great as Saints & Soldiers","I don't think anything could compare to Saints & Soldiers, but I was hoping it would be longer and more complete with its character development than it was."
4,We liked it,This was a much different story than I was expecting but we really enjoyed it. My sister is a film student and had many criticisms of the movie but the story was one of encouragement and courage during a very difficult situation. God Bless America.
5,Saints and Soldiers Excels Again,"For a movie made with a small budget this is fabulous! I truly love the story also and it gives you faith again in the goodness of mankind. The acting was actually really good too, surprisingly so for a smaller budget movie."
1,Horrible WWII movie!,"I watched this movie and was totally disgusted by how fake and unrealistic it was.First, there are no mountains in the area of Normandy where the Allied Forces parachuted in. The terrain in the movie looked more like parts of California than France.Second, Hollywood directors don't know jack about the military. Soldiers don't bunch up in a group and fire on the enemy. And they don't fire standing up or kneeling down. They lay down in the prone position to avoid being shot. These actors were just that. Acting. And not acting very well.Finally, US soldiers didn't save Germans during D-Day by letting them live to fight another day. For the most part they were under orders to not take prisoners.Overall, this was a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the Band of Brothers theme but was so badly written and directed that it is more of a comedy than a drama."
3,A light and quick read ...,"The fourth book in the Hawkenlye mystery series is a short quick read. It's set in medieval times (circa 1190) in an Abbey in East Anglia. The plot is a simple one with a predictable outcome.Three sisters arrive at the Abbey with no place to go. Both parents are dead. One exhibits strange and violent behavior. Soon, a pilgrim to a nearby holy attraction dies mysteriously.When the Abbess investigates, she uncovers another violent death. The outcome is predictable. There's a very minor romance sub-plot that adds a bit of spice to an otherwise mediocre story.If you like Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series or Peter Tremayne's Sister Fidelma series, you will probably like this book. But if you prefer brain-teasing puzzles or a book rich with accurate history, then this book probably is not for you."
3,Solid book,"Alys Clare has a long and successful mystery series set in the XI century, featuring abbess Helowese and her friend, the knight Josse d'Acquin. Her books are short and light, with the focus on the rich tapestry of historical details and authentic data. Her forte, unfortunately,isn't the staple of a good mystery, the proverbial puzzle. Her mysteries are lightweight and not very mindgripping. For marvelous portrayal of the times begone she deserves 3,5 stars if possible."
5,"great , so far","I have recently purchased this riveter and it has worked well. it will set a 3/16ths rivet with ease. I use mostly 1/8"", so it will probably last forever, which is really the only concern that I have. I usually shy away from taiwan tools, but a US built rivet gun is $500-1000, and I just don't use one enough to spend that much. I will say that import tools from taiwan have made great strides recently(a vast number of companies in taiwan/china are former US companies that moved overseas). I will do an update later, but it has been flawless so far."
2,Better options exist,"I bought this riveter to assist with building my race car, which has 1000+ rivets holding the various aluminum panels in place. This tool hasn't been much of a help. It works okay fine with 1/8 rivets, but for such small rivets, it's simply easier to use a hand riveter. For 3/16 rivets, which are much harder to manually squeeze, this tool ends up jamming 50% of the time. I spend so much time trying to drive the jammed rivet plugs out of the tool, I may as well have used a manual plier-type tool.My recommendation is that if you have many 3/16 rivets to drive, spend more money and get a better unit."
2,"Very Cheap tops, about half of the bottle tops already broke!","I bought these bottles for holding beauty products that I make with essential oils. If you screw the cap on tight (so The oil doesn't leak!) the tops of the bottles crack. These are very cheaply made and are quite expensive. I will not purchase these again. In fact I ordered another set hoping that i wouldnt have the same problem but its been three weeks and I havent even received them yet! My advice, look elsewhere!!"
1,Caps are too fragile for use,"I bought these to use for pure oregano oil, which is very potent. I couldn't tighten the caps sufficient because they would crack. As a woman of a certain age, I don't have the strongest hands, but I still managed to crack every third cap while tightening them. I would not recommend buying them if a tight seal is important to you."
5,Sweet and touching,"I totally disagree with the editorial review here. The illustrations are sweet and the story adorable. I was saddened to see it was out of print, as my one copy is so worn out from use. My three girls have loved this story since they got it years ago. It has such a good lesson, that no matter how busy the Mommy is, she (as Mrs. Gigglebelly, anyway) always has time for her little girl, so long as the girl is patient. And the first time each of my daughters found out that Mrs. Gigglebelly was really the mother in disguised, was priceless. In my opinion, this book is a classic. Go to the library and read it to your little one, I bet you'll agree."
4,power packed with ideas,"This little book is power packed with ideas for purses, felted and not. I've never seen a knitting book with so many cute and stylish patterns. I will probably be making most of them."
2,Not in the bags,"The patterns in this book are nice, cute, interesting but very difficult to knit because of the many mistakes in the patterns. There is a web site you can go to for corrections but with so many on a page it made it even more difficult."
4,White Fudge Covered Pretzels - Recommended,"These ""White Fudge"" covered Pretzels are very good and make a good sweet snack since the white fudge covering is fairly thin, just enough to make it tasty but not enough to be overpowering. These get eaten up fairly quickly by my teens if we leave them out, so we generally put out one or two bags at a time.Recommended!CFH"
3,Good but tramatized,I use to absolutely love these and would've given these 5 stars until........One day I purchased a bag from my local grocery store and as always I'm eager whenever I get my hands on these little guys anyways I open them I have one and I'm like mmm yum and I rest my hand in the bag and when I pull the nxt pretzel to pop into my mouth I see a maggot crawling on it and I tear open the bag only to find the whole bag to be infested with maggots!Why?! I don't know! As far as I was aware maggots eat rotting flesh not fudge covered pretzels :( anyways ever since then I have never again boughten a bag of these....... But if I remember correctly they were good and well worth the 4-5 bucks spent on each bag.
4,Good,"I love chocolate covered pretzels, and these are pretty good. The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book. It's easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting.I have tried the dark chocolate variety but found those to be pretty tasteless, the milk chocolate definitely complements the pretzels. If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars."
3,"good, but could be better in the chocolate department","These are good, but the chocolate coating is a bit waxy and the chocolate could be more chocolaty. The chocolate kind reminds me of a heftier version of the chocolate coating that Hostess or Little Debbie cakes have as an icing on their products."
4,Extremely refreshing,"Its really, really difficult to put to words and music the truth and love in the christian message without sounding too preachy, holier-than-thou, or cheezy. Josh Caterer manages to relate his convictions with honesty and beauty, as only a songwriter of his credentials could do. Singing straight from the heart, as he was made famous for in his Smoking Popes days, he's written a collection of unpretentious songs that achieve just the right balance of melody, truth, and honesty. Its not condescending, its not overly judgemental, its just deeply personal and sincere music... just what I've been looking for."
4,A good buy,I bought this album for my teenage son who really liked it. I found to my surprise I enjoyed it too.
4,Fun Book,"My mom is visiting for a while and we like watching Paula's show. So I gave my mom this book for Christmas. We have tried a few of the desserts and they are simple and easy to make. However, I picked up on one mistake - I had just watched the show on Chewy Sugar Squares and I decided to make it and it turned out really well. But in the book ""butter"" which is one of the key ingredients is missing. I don't know if there are other errors.My mom like also likes the book as Deen writes about her bio in depth and has a very personable style of writing."
4,Simple Southern Sweetness,"Ms. Deen has put together a simple yet delicious group of desserts that ooze Southern charm. A lot of these I remember from growing up and others just look delicious. I have made the signature Gooey Butter Cakes and many of the cookies. The Stick To Your Mouth Chocolate Cookies are sinful! Anyone interested in either Southern Desserts or just easy to prepare, delicious ends to their meals must purchase this book. You won't be disappointed at all."
3,Not tempting enough,"I received this book as a gift for Xmas and was quite excited to read through it as I enjoy PD's cooking show. However, I was really disappointed with the recipes and have only made one of the recipes in a years time.The biggest disappointment to me is the use of processed cake mixes and pie crusts. I can't cook to save my life but I can bake really well and there's a reason I do it ALL from scratch. :) Because many of the cakes call for premade mixes, I'll never bother to make them.I think the rest of my distaste is simply that the recipes don't really appeal to my personal tastes (much to my surprise). I'm not a big fan of coconut, chocolate or bananas. :)"
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this book. There were very few photos (16 pages of photos for 120+ recipes). I expected higher class recipes from a restaurant (less use of canned Pillsbury biscuits, brownie and cake mixes, jarred ice cream topping, frozen whipped topping, and saltines). And way too many recipes call for coconut (with no note of possible substitutions or omissions).I bought this book for my mom. I hope she likes it more than I did."
3,"Just OK, nothing more.","Recipes contained are ok. I've scanned through the book and there just isn't anything with a ""WOW"" factor."
3,Nothing great,"Read the recipes carefully, mistakes abound. Desserts pretty good, alot of box mixes, etc.. Really doesn't teach alot about cooking, but recipes are easy and some are very quick."
3,Could be better,"I love Paula Deen, and I love to bake. I am also pretty good at it. Most of the recipes are very tempting, but I do not like to use cake mixes and other pre-packaged food in my baking. I expected better from her.Also, I have made 2 things so far. The orange brownies, and the pumpkin squares. While the brownies were very tasty, the baking time was way off, and the glaze is very thick - way too thick to pour, as she directs in the recipe. It's a very simple recipe, and I am sure that it was a mistake in the instructions.The pumpkin cake was very good, but that was because of the icing. The cake itself was bland and tasteless, and crying out for additional spice and butter instead of corn oil. I belive that a cake needs to stand on its own, and the icing just enhances it.That said, I'll still use the book, but I am aware that I will have to make a lot of adjustments."
3,ok not up to date old cookbook,"I was disappointed, I expected her newer recipes in ther but instead they are old ones."
1,Someone with an Axe to Grind,"A very well written and analytical analysis of the Chabad movement. Berger is able to hide and mask his hatered and venom against Chabad in a sophisticated manner.This is nothing short of ""baseless hatred""!"
1,distorted facts,I find it very aggrevaiting to read a book of lies and hate that the auther seems to have towards a great group of jews who do so much for world jewery
1,Lies from an unknowledgable author,"David Berger attacks the Chabad movement in this book, when in truth he is comparing all of Chabad to the small percentage who actually believe that the Rebbe is the Mesiah. He is creating a negative stereotype of a movement that does great acts. He is degrading a man of great stature,a man who brought many great things to this world, only to try to elevate himself. It is a shame that during such troublesome times as these, a man such as David Berger tries to split people appart, and cause much animosity and hatred towards fellow Jews. I am just an Orthodox Jew, but seeing all of the great acts preformed by the Chabad movement can not just sit back and watch such lies be said about Chabad-Lubavitch and their esteemed leader."
1,Mis-information and Bashing a True Jewish Community,"B""HDr Berger's book does not accurately describe Lubavitch nor the Messianic prophesises which the Rebbe himself stated. His accusations of the Meshichisten are totally false as no normal Mechichist belives the Rebbe is G-d. Certainly, no Lubavitcher has the Rebbe's picture on the eastern wall of any room. The Rebbe's piety and unswerving committment to Torah True Judiasm is well-documented and anyone who slanders the name of this great Tzaddik will have to deal with Hashem after 120 years. May Dr Berger do Teshuva before Moshiach comes with the Emes. To compare the Rebbe, a Gaon and Tzaddik, to a Rasha who tried to destroy the Torah and caused 2000 years of grief and pain to Jews is unforgiveable. It is well-known that many our later-day Gaonim including Rav Aharon Soloveitchik and Rav Moshe Feinstein had only the greatest respect for this Torah giant. Use the money you would spend on this book, to give Tzedaka and do a Mitzva."
2,"A man, a book, and a witchhunt","David Berger is certainly an erudite scholar but he is hypocritical in this his first book about Lubavitch Chasidism. He claims that the Lubavitchers in believing that their leader was the Messiah are violating a fundamental principal of Judaism. However, I believe that the most fundamental concept in Judaism is Love Thy Neighbor, a law that Dr. Berger violates with cruel intent throughout this meticulously researched book. Who is the better Jew? Dr. Berger or the typical Lubavitcher, that is for you the reader to decide, but Dr. Berger is surely no saint himself!"
4,Further Analysis,"After reading this book and discussing the situation with a number of researchers and followers of The Rebbe, I have come to the following conclusions. First, it is difficult to discover who is and who is not a ""believer."" Where I live, it seems that most are ""believers,"" based upon signs on their houses and cars. Second, In talks with scholars who focus their research on Jewish - Christian relations up to 300 CE, the view taken by ""believers"" is exactly the same as non-Paulist Christians (Paul was the one who went to the non-Jews). Third, the position taken by the ""believers"" adds strength to Christians who try to convert Jews. When visiting my son is an Orthodox camp in the Catskills, I saw a billboard with the picture of the Rebbe and the words ""Right idea, Wrong Person."" Yes, while Chabad have brought many people to their brand of Judaism, if the ""believers"" continue to do their way, what religion are they supporting? That, seems to be the thrust of this book."
4,Very important book for Orthodox Jews,"This is a very important book for non-Chabad Orthodox Jews, every one of whom should read it.I don't think it matters one iota for anyone else.Unfortunately, Berger spends far too much time comparing modern Messianism to Christianity rather than getting to the heart of the matter, which he finally does in the final chapter: Can you trust the hashgacha of a Chabad Messianist Rabbi? (Check with your own rabbi; the answers are complex.)"
1,the ego of a man can blind a person,"David Berger, a man looking to ""make it big"" in the Jewish world has found yet another culprit. This time it is the largest Jewish outreach organization in the world! An organization unmatched in its kind. Yet Berger has no problem doing that, he actually find that to be his main goal, in order to make it big he must take a culprit who is that big and the largest in Judaism today!(...) I know first hand that in the community I live in the Chabad representative is nothing (not even close) to what Berger portrays them to be.For all of you out there looking to buy a book with truth! This is not one of them. if you choose to buy it consult with your chabad rabbi and find out true facts."
1,what a shame!,"How can someone, in the right mind, write such a book is beyond comprehension. It is clear that Dr Berger knows nothing, or very little of what chabad it."
1,A yid who wants moshiach!!!,"I have never seen a more depresing work! A primary for ""baseless hatred""."
1,not interperting correct,"This book is written as if the author didn't know the first thing amout Judaism and the messiah, Don't buy it. It's a waste of money!!"
1,Interesting book,"Berger uses cuning scare tactics to further his baseless agenda. If he didn't write these books he would be a ""nobody""! He wouldn't have a penny to his name. So he attacks a giant! How easy... How cowardly...It is well known that ""to make an accusation is easy, to disprove it is almost impossible""! Anyone can say the president kennedy had an affair with them...In this case you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize the foolishness & inacuracy of this book.After the first page I was certain that this book fits in Reb Moshe Feinstein's category of books that ""you're not allowed to take OUT of the Bathroom!"
1,A real Surprize from Professor Berger,"Unsurprisingly enough, Prof. Berger spared no talent nor time in writing this highly controversial book, dealing with one of the most (if not the most) famous, and productive groups of Chassidim in the world today.Creating the uproar and ripple effect as it did, I decided to purchase the book for myself. Don't we all have a spark of Curious George in us?I was shocked beyond words when I read the first few chapters, which dilate on nothing more than hate, and (although intriguing, however) unnecessary spiteful information, about what I consider the MOST productive and helpful orginization in the world.The content of the book is not only Halachacly imbalanced, (and these issued were addressed to Prof. Berger by very prominent Rabbis), but also ignominious, as it tries to 'undo' all the good that this group has done for the world in the past, preset, and what this group will hopefully continue to do in the future."
4,Berger admitted on the radio...,"...That the beleif in a messiah from the dead is not a veiw which contradicts torah veiw, however he claims that it is a minority veiw, which also doesn't prove anything , just because it is only mentioned several times , does not mean that it is a minority veiw! His remaining two complaints is A)the fact that lubavitch veiws the rebbe as the definitive messiah. That is a false claim as well; one does not need to immediatly explain that he is the probable messiah just like the gemara does not immediatly warn of that when describing the POSSIBLE messiah! B)The alleged lubavitch beleif in the rebbe as g-d ch""v. The above is simply an exageration of a similar veiw mentioned and encouraged in torah- which is spoken about by some mashpi'm.Berger's proffesional avoidance of the above simple points made me give him a four star"
3,good adea but not a kid friendly,"The choice of train sets is huge. I chose this one: I did not relize how fragile those sets (or is it this particualr one?). It is not easy for an adult to assemble it correctly (very small part, diffiucult to see if the rail connection is good),"
4,A Good Starter Set,"If the children in your life love Thomas as my Grandsons do, they will love this set. I purchased some extra rolling stock to make the train longer. Bachmann's coupling system with this set is difficult to manage and is frustrating for my Grandsons. So far they have not broken them so they get points for durability. NOTE: the controller stopped functioning after about an hour of use. Fortunately I have additional controllers I could use. Bachmann sent me a new one in good time. You can't beat their warranty."
2,cute but controller broke within a week,the controller no longer works- only goes one direction very disappointed with the purchase. need to buy a new one
5,Thomas,Made the grand son very happy. Easy to assemble and to use! Good learning set for a young train enthusiast!
1,crap,"Bought this for my grandson, what a piece of high price crap ! will not stay on track no matter what you do. The cheap engine and cars are too light."
2,So-so,"The main problems with this train are: The train does tend to fall off the track, mostly at high speed. The THOMAS car is not really strong enough to pull Annie and Clarabelle, so often he derails. Also, the hook up for the trains is terrible and the don't stay together. My 3 year old son likes to watch Thomas go around all by himself, so HE likes it. I, on the other hand am a little disappointed and would not recommend it."
4,Thomas Electric Train,"We got this for our son; he is too young for the tiny pieces, which we didn't know until we got it. It looks like a lot of fun we will have together, so we decided to keep it for his summer birthday--by then, he will be better able to take care of it and have fun with it."
5,Facinating,Wonderful. Nicholas and Alexandra come alive. Also very sad. A wealth of historical information. A must read for the History Buff. I would recommend it for all to read.
1,Don't be fooled. This book is not obscene.,"It just seems like it is. The author supports thoughtless reproduction to create cannon fodder for the ""End Times,"" and never using the faculty of reason that God gave us. These Talibangelicals oppress their women, beat their children, and blame it all on God.This isn't Christian. It's just crazy. Somebody needs to bone up on their Beatitudes."
5,review by an editor,"Of great value not only to the researcher but most helpful for diligent students and questing laypeople as well, with its thoroughly up-to-date detailing of many commonly-encountered endocrine maladies and a number of exotic disorders as well. As a scientifically untrained reader, I found many articles of interest and enlightenment."
4,Really cute!,I've got all 3 of the other CDs in this series and they're all great. My toddler really responds to the other children's voices and wants to hear it all the time. He just can't get enough!
4,thought provoking and informative,"de Boer's work is thought-provoking and insightful. Whether or not you agree with her conclusions, it will certainly widen your horizons and make you think hard (and probably outside the box!)."
3,Who was Mary?,"I read all I can about Mary. This is a nice addition along with Starbird, and of course, Defenders of the Holy Grail. We have been the victims of a patriarchal plot to remove Mary's role. This book helps restore balance"
4,Fine,"I thought I might be able to put these in another locket, but they are rather big to put in more than one or two I think, but I""m going to keep looking. As for them being crystals, I don't know, they seem maybe a bit better than plastic. I would say the bag and box they came in are probably worth the price, so win win either way!"
4,Perfect gift,The birthstone set worked perfectly with the locket. My mother in-law wears it daily. She enjoys it very much.
2,wrong item i wanted,i thought i was getting the sat of 36 studs you offer... bummer. its not worth returning at 498 on a 6.99 dollar item...
5,Every pubescent kid should read!,"This story is the best I've ever read when it comes to describing a pubescent child in love! As an adult, I still like to read it for a good laugh."
4,Positive viewing,"This was a gift for my son-in-law who said that he liked it very much and learned some valuable things from it. He is a dancer, thus I respect his opinion."
4,Advanced Tango figures,Nice but hard figures for very advance dancers. Some you may never use unless with your practiced dance partner.
5,Lets change the sub-title,"I usually look for books which delves into details about a subject familiar to me. This book covers an area of history that was a complete blank to me - the Japanese connection to the Holocaust. Germany's Asian friend in the then Axis of Evil was the only nation who had a plan to stop the extermination of the Jews. The plan was to save at least one million, but they ended up protecting only tens of thousands. Still a better track record than the US.Schindler got a major motion picture out of his story, this tale remains next to unknown - lets change that.As for the book: Rabbi Tokayer writes as he speaks: very well. I might have to buy a second copy since mine always seems be lent out."
1,Worst Math Curriculum Ever!,This whole curriculum is the worst I have seen in years. How can you teach someone math if you just give them a workbook full of problems? Maybe a text book with instruction along with a few solved problems as examples would help.
1,DO NOT USE THIS BOOK,"These series have not examples to follow, no parent helps. No other books are taken home to show how to work the problems! Unless you (an adult) have extensive algebra training, forget this series."
1,Awful,"The Connected Math series is utterly useless. My 13 yr old for the first time, now hates math. The title of the series is a joke, my son feels very disconnected to the concepts. As a parent, I find it difficult to understand, the language is terrible. Our public schools our using them & the teachers hate it. ( The one star is because Amazon makes you give at least one."
1,Worst math book!!!,"This is the worst math curriculum ever! All the teachers in our district can't stand it but are forced to use it. The teachers have to supplement the lessons with their own worksheets that provide explanations of the concepts. There are no examples of how to do anything, so if the child does not know what to do they are out of luck, especially for homework. For parents, it's a nightmare. You have to go online and find other curriculums that actually teach the child the concepts in order to help your child. This book assumes your child knows the concepts instead of teaching them the concepts. This book should be banned, it's that bad."
1,Best used for kindling,"I'm normally against book banning or burning of any sort, but for this entire series of so-called textbooks, I'll make an exception. A one-star rating, frankly, is too generous.If you're already a mathematician who enjoys no instruction whatsoever along with mind-numbing ambiguity, this is the book for you.If, however, you're a middle-schooler trying to learn and understand new math concepts, you could learn just as much by banging your head against a wall. Which, by the way, is probably what you'll end up doing out of frustration, as will your parents."
5,Great resource,I found this book to be an excellent resource in my quest to date and place old family photos. I have been researching family history and in the process have gotten many clues from old photos. This book is a great resorce to help interpret what a photo is telling you. I will keep this as a resource in my genealogy library.
5,Wonderful,"This is a great showcase for McPartland's interpretations of songs. I gave the CD to one of my adult piano students who drove around in her car getting inspired by it. The songs are the best & I should've gotten myself a copy. If you like jazz & solo piano, you should get this absolutely wonderful CD."
2,Samsung mouse - disappointing,"Pro : It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand, good shape.I use it with a CAD system and wanted a high resolution optical mouse that will work on any paper on my desk. It does this well.Con : I had difficulty setting the scroll wheel scale factor to give similar results in various applications and CAD windows. Never got it really satisfactory with the Samsung driver.The rubber coating started wearing off and got lumpy after 2 weeks use.The scroll wheel died with a click after 3 weeks.Most disappointing."
2,"I knew it was something different, but...","If you are an old fan of JT forget about this cd. Now, I don't know if it is good or bad, because I am not able to forget the ""old"" JT, maybe it is a good music in its own.Lastly, I can't find the bonus video track in my japanese version..."
4,infectious,"At first casual listen I was quite disappointed, the 70's Tull sound now completely gone by this albums creation in 1984. But subsequent listens grabbed me. This is a great album! I can't even point my finger on it but there is something really enjoyable and infectious about this music. I've been listening to quite a bit of the other, mostly 70's, Tull albums and this one is refreshing for a change of pace when I discovered it recently. This was an album I wrote off before I ever listened to it, big mistake. Ian proves he can master the more electronic and synth influenced music and make it work- and work well. Kind of funny, but after listening to Under Wraps for a while, the other Tull material is what sounded 'different' and a bit off. Its all good but give Under Wraps a chance, look past some of that 80's vibe and you'll find some great timeless music. Just give it a couple of listens before you pass judgement..."
3,Tull Goes Techno!!!,"This is the first Jethro Tull album that was engineered and mixed entirely by the band. It not only is a divisive album amongst Tull fans, but also amongst Tull musicians as well. Martin Barre says it's the one Tull album he listens to for pleasure, while bass player Dave Pegg says the Broadsword outtakes would have been better.This is also one of the few albums that Ian shares writing credits on, with keyboardist Peter Vetesse doing most of the collaborating.The album suffers from the lack of a human drummer, Ian Anderson choosing instead to employ a drum machine. It also suffers from a lack of flute as well, as the Peter Vetesse's synthesisers take center stage for this album. In some respects Ian Anderson is a sideman on this album. Because of that every song with the exeption of ""Under Wraps II"" sounds the same as the previous one.Under Wraps is a lot like the Drama album in the Yes catalog, good example of 80's rock, not so good example of Jethro Tull."
2,jethro tull,"While I dont really like this lp, Im going to give Tull a pass on this one. I dont know what it was about the eighties, but so many good groups put out horrible records. I guess it was the advent of computers and synthesizers that groups felt pressure to put that sound into their music. Big mistake for a classic rock outfit like Tull. Just pass on this one and pick up something from earlier on in the catalog. This lp sounds like a cheesy movie soundtrack."
2,It had to happen.,"Tull is my favorite band, and ""Songs From The Wood"" is my favorite Tull album. (I've bought SFTW three times.) The cover art of ""Under Wraps"" has always intrigued me, but the reviews always scared me off. Well, it wasn't as scary as it was cathartic to finally hear what has to be the worst Jethro Tull album ever. Every band has one, and this is theirs. It is Ian's version of eighties electronica music, a genre that I'm sure he felt he needed to explore at the time, but a genre which is the opposite of his strengths as an artist and composer. If you listen to their album ""A"", you can hear a more successful and finessed style of synth-dominated songs. If you really like ""A"", you may appreciate the sound of ""Under Wraps"" more than I. I need to hear the acoustic instruments and natural themes of classic Tull when they sound like Tull and not the flavor of the times. But, hey, an artist has to experiment to stay interested so no problem, Ian! Thanks for all the amazing music, mate."
2,2.5 stars...not all bad,Sounds extremely dated...drum machine gets on my nerves...there are some good songs though and probably would sound good live and done with real drums...some interesting keyboard work and some guitar passages shine...I didn't know Frasier's brother Niles was a member of Tull !
1,Absolute Crap,"I'm a huge Tull fan, and I even really like some of their work that has been less than well-received ( such as ""A"" and ""Broadsword and the Beast,"" but ""Under Wraps"" is undoubtedly the most unimpressive collection of nonsense they have ever released. I bought it because I have been slowly collecting all the remastered Tull, but as I listened to it for the first time, I found myself realizing that I would probably never listen to it again - any of it. It will probably also be the one CD that I own that I will not load into my iPod, because honestly I never want to hear any of it again. A major disappointment."
2,Under Wraps? Underwhelming.,"As someone who loves the ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Broadsword and the Beast"" sections of the Tull catalog, it's probably not stunning that I was less excited by ""Under Wraps,"" with its excessive (and frankly, rather tepid) electronica. Having adored ""Broadsword"" and its evocative textures, I pounced on this album immediately after release, but ultimately it just leaves me cold. There are always great moments in a Tull album, and ""Under Wraps"" certainly has a few, but ultimately the memorable is outweighed by the annoying. If you liked ""A"" -- and I'm in the middle of the road there, feeling that the players were better than the material -- you might find something in ""Under Wraps"" to like, but there are at least 15 better places to start where Jethro Tull is concerned."
2,Two stars were a gift.,"I have been working through Jethro Tull albums for a while now, starting at the oldest and working my way to the most recent. This album, unfortunately, stopped me in my tracks for a few years. I have only recently been able to skip over it and continue into their discography. It was really that bad.I know a lot of fans dislike A. And while I too found it to be a bit of a curveball, I grew to love it. Under Wraps I just could not bear to listen to. I tried once or twice, but ultimately, had to shelve it. The only redeeming aspect that earned it 2 stars was the track Under Wraps #2. It is a quite good track and has earned itself a spot in my Jethro Tull collection."
3,Mediocre Tull record,"As a longtime Jethro Tull fan, I often recommend CDs to start with for friends and/or new fans. Unfortunately, 'Under Wraps' is never one I recommend. Why? Read on.The songs here are good for '80s synth pop. But it's just not Jethro Tull's area of strength. Ian's voice is really good, but it's just not great. And Ian's voice is usually great, but it's just not here.Now, I will say, I enjoyed the acoustic, back-to-the-seventies-Tull 'Under Wraps #2,' but other than that, there's really no reason to give this album a listen.I give it three stars because it's Tull and for 'Under Wraps #2.' But otherwise, this is not a very good record. But Tull is one of the best ever, so that is why I give it three stars.Recommended for the Tull collector and die-hard, but nobody else."
3,Less is more,"Disc#1 is ok if you in to relaxing, very down tempo music. Disc#2 had some promising artists and contains some good tracks. Both 2 stars.Disc#3 is in my opinion a compilation that truly belongs in the Balance Series. It reminded me somewhat of Balance 5 (in my opinion the best progressive album ever). Very smoothly mixed and great tracks! 5 stars.So less is more, I think 3 CD's is just to much. And after listening the #3 I do not think I will soon be listening to the other two again.But for Disc#3 this is definitely worthwhile buying."
1,Wow Jimmy just wow ...,I am gonna make this review short & sweet I cant believe what jimmy tried topull over on us here I can maybe understand one downtempo disc but two & a half ??? That is just down right wrong !!! Now I just picked up his newer version 10.1 and that one disc completely blew this 3 disc set away with outa doubt I have been a fan of Jimmy's for a very long time since the 90's & even the free mixes he was putting out as a hype tool for this album killed it I saw him with Sasha at Space in Miami for this tour & He was great so Ijust don't understand what happened ... And I have loved almost every balance that has dropped but this one just hurt especially the time I put into finding this album ... Tisk tisk tisk
3,pretty but weak,"We stayed at a friend's house with one of these in the guest bathroom and my children fell in love with the beautiful, glittery light it puts out. We had to have one for their room! The glitter inside is very pretty, just as we remembered. What I did not recall was how weak the light actually is. It is fine because the whole purpose of this light is to give them enough light to get to the door for night time trips to the bathroom but if they really needed to see much it would be pretty useless. The unit also gets a little more warm than I would like. We have to be really diligent about making sure it gets turned off as soon as they wake up (all of our other night lights are automatic). All in all it was a fine purchase for the price but decidedly less magical than we remembered."
3,Glitter show doesn't last,"First of all, very pretty to look at and very awesome that it's a replica of the large lava lamps. Disappointed the glitter stops swirling after being plugged in for some time. I had to unplug it and shake it then put it in the socket. All that trouble, why bother with a switch?! I also just noticed now the product description included size but this is definitely a little larger than I was hoping for."
3,"Trendy, Cute & Hot","This is a cute item and is NOT a toy. We have a blue and a pink one and neither one give off much light in the dark. The base of the light does get to be pretty hot and needs to in order to heat the liquid inside to get the glitter to move. It's a neat effect indeed. It has a nice toggle switch on the front to make it convenient to turn ON/OFF. We don't leave ours on all night. We slip into the kids' rooms once they are fast asleep and turn them off. They seem like them might burn a lot of energy staying on all night and I'm uncomfortable leaving them on all night as well, given how hot the base gets. Call me old fashioned and safety sensitive."
1,Dud,Annoyed that the glitter remained settled like one that has already been running for too long. This was the first time that a new one has behaved this way.
3,Doesn't Swirl....,"I bought this little glitter light to liven up the powder room for a St. Patty's Day party. As a night light goes, it is OK, and maybe I was expecting too much. There is no 'swirling' to speak of, unless you want to focus on an area of 6 inches by 6 inches directly behind the light. If you really look closely there is a very subtle pattern in this miniscule area. The powder room is small, I was imaging little flecks of light here and there, guess I will have to keep imaging! Or maybe after a bottle or two or three of Irish beer the lights will appear. Another reviewer wrote that the light has to be vertical and shaken to work ...well shaking is fine and dandy for maybe a 5 second swirl ... Also, I would say the color is yellow, which is actually quite pretty, but I was wanting something in green tones. Not worth the bother to return, yellow is my favorite color, I will just use it as a night light in my bathroom."
3,"Cute, but...","Let me preface this review by saying that the choices in night lights are dismal. The concept for this night light is cute but there are a few problems with it:1. Can be positioned vertically, horizontally or upside down. This is a plus because it's rather tall for a night light (6"" or so) and depending on the space, it may not fit unless repositioned.2. Glitter circulates only if the nightlight is vertically positioned and if you shake the night light first.3. Construction and materials are cheap. The silver cap became detached within a couple of days. It is easily glued back on but for the price one shouldn't have to repair it within a couple of days of receiving it.4. I think the price is a steep given the poor quality."
4,great lost thrash trio! from seattle no less!?,these guys are a lost treasure they remind me of prong(87-89)era but faster.these guys were a very talented threesome with alot of promise.these prices are unreal but find it cheeper for a real treat.
2,Dries up in container,"These wipes worked great for light cleaning until they dried up in the sealed container. I only used about six of the wipes, noticing that each time I pulled one out, the wipes were progressively drier than the time before. I had to throw out a nearly-full container of them as they were useless. Adding water doesn't help as it affects the cleaning power. The container should probably be stored in a Ziploc bag or other container to prevent drying out. I won't buy these again."
2,Unimpressive product,"I've used Weiman products for years and think they're the best. But this one is a big disappointment. It's passable at cleaning but fails miserably when it comes to a shine. Dull and unimpressive are two words that come to mind. If you're looking for a good cleaning product that leaves a brilliant shine, try Weiman Cook Top Glass Cook Top Cleaner. This liquid product has impressed the heck out of me on two successive glass cook top stoves, and I have yet to find one that works as well."
3,Average tennis shoe,"I bought this pair for tennis mostly. The shoe is decently made, though the inside of the shoe didn't have the smoothest finish and had leather pieces sicking out, especially inside the flap. I wore the shoes twice, but had to return since these run 1/2 size to a size small and were squeezing my feet painfully hard. Though I wear 9.5 M, I would either get 10 M or 9.5 D for myself. Treads are good for a tennis shoe, but the cushioning is the minimum you can have in a tennis shoe. The shoe looks great BTW.I'm a little miffed since I had to return the shoe because of the shoe being 1/2 size smaller and on the product description, there was no mention of needing to buy 1/2 size larger and Amazon is still deducting from my refund."
2,"Nice shoe, no good for actually playing tennis...","First off these shoes look great. They have that simple classic look that will forever look good, so if you're looking to pick up a pair to wear around with jeans you'll be more than happy. But, if you're like me and looking for an inexpensive pair of shoes to actually play the game of tennis in these are not worth your time. The material is light and cheap and the rubber they use on the sole/toes does not hold up at all. After about two months of playing I had worn a hole all the way through the toe area on each shoe. So, 10/10 for style, 2/10 for durability on the court."
5,Reebok Classic Ace Tennis Shoe,"I have been wearing these for a long time. I use three pairs at a time. The oldest for working in the garden or yard, the next oldest for around town and running errands and the best pair for semi dress up. Like with jeans, etc. Then when the best pair get a little runchy, I buy a new pair, dump the oldest and move the best pair up into second spot. The second best pair then goes to the working in the garden spot. May sound silly, but that is what I do. I also keep three pair of white ones and do the same."
1,SIZE IS EVERYTHING IN SHOES!,"I ORDERED SIZE 7 1/2, BEEN WEARING THIS SIZE FOR 40 YEARS, TOO LITTLE, ORDERED SIZE 8, TOO BIG, WHAT'S THE DEAL??????????"
3,really tight,I was really excited to get these shoes at a great price. When I got them every thing was exactly as advertised. Size was perfect but these shoes are really really tight on the sides. Gotta go with a wide size on these shoes.
3,Shoe is 1/2 size too small.,"I bought size 10 M .. and the shoe was 1/2 size too small, even though it was labelled as a size 10. I returned those shoes and then ordered 10 1/2, and they fit like a 10."
3,Not the classic,"Reebok's Classic Ace is not a bad shoe but, for me, not as good as the true classic. I bought a pair of these when I could't find the Classic running shoe."
4,Favorite shoe,I like the style and fit of this shoe. I have more than one pair and wear these all the time. The only reason it didn't get a higher rating is the leather is not as soft as it was some years ago.
4,"Good-looking, runs tight","Definitely a sharp-looking shoe. I have narrow feet, and it was even a little tight for me. But it does provide good support. You will want to be sure to buy this from a place that offers non-hassle returns just in case you need to up-size it. I wear a 9 or 9.5, depending on the brand. I went with the 9.5 with this shoe and am glad I did. Overall a good buy for the cost. I will update this review in a few weeks to comment on well it is holding up."
3,Sizing not accurate,"Good, general quality overall, but my pair is at least a half to full size too small and narrow. I've worn them twice, hoping they'd stretch a little, but they're still too tight and uncomfortable. I wear a 12 M, and there was no option for a 12.5 or a wide size. I'm not sure if a 13 would be too big. I had to wear very thin socks to be able to wear them. I would return them but I've worn them twice. Disappointing."
4,good tennis shoe,"These are good ""low to the ground"" type tennis shoes, that are a good combination of soft uppers, but with another support around the heel and the arch. This is my third pair and they don't dissapoint."
5,"Dark Angel : ""Time Does Not Heal""....","...BUY THIS NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!...This is without question the best Dark Angel release ever. It's very hard to find these days, but if you do get your hands on this masterpiece, you'll be very happy you did...The way to descibe this is simple....IT'S BRUTAL!!!I thought that this release should have won ""Heavy Metal Album Of The Year"" when it came out. This is 100 times better than their previous effort ""Darkness Descends"". There is simply no comparison between the two.....This kicks some serious !!!BUY IT NOW!!!"
4,Bullet Ballet,"I have to admit, this movie is great with a couple of minor flaws.-Note: Ballistic Kiss is a gun fight movie and not a ""martial arts"" movie, so if you're expecting Donnie Yen to do the ""Shadowless Kick"" look somewhere else.The action is great and is so incredibly stylish. The lighting, music, and action complement each other perfectly. Watching the fights is like ballet, except with guns and blood.The flaws are the storyline and the acting by the female lead.Well, you should buy this DVD if you want to see action that stylishly cool and Donnie Yen with really ""unique"" sunglasses."
4,a stylish movie.,"No one makes gangster films like John Woo did anymore, not even John Woo himself. Ballistic Kiss is another attempt to revive or prolong the genre, and it apparently failed. Like many HK movies in the genre and befitting its title, Ballistic Kiss is over-loaded with bullets but suffers from a thin plot. However, if it did not succeed in becoming a great film, at least it was a good try. The movie is simply STYLISH. It has great visuals, every frame is masterfully shot, scene transitions are smooth, and the sound track is unusually good for a HK movie.Donnie Yen directed, starred in the film, and choreographed for the action scenes. An ambitious filmmaker, he managed to give the film a fresh look. It is during some non-action scenes that his unique vision is manifested. After a bloody battle, the killer dances alone in a dark enclosed room, for a moment, the world around him seems to have disappeared. It is surreal."
2,A failed experiment from Donnie Yen,"Donnie Yen stars as a hitman who will wait until he has 10 guns pointed at him before making his hit. Unrealistic? Of course it is, but this is a Donnie Yen movie. Yen was a cop and got framed by his partner. After being in jail for 4 years he became a hitman. Now he is out for revenge. There is a female cop after Yen and he falls in love with her.The story is bad, but not completely unwatchable. Everything is very predictable. I would be fine with this if the movie had good action, but it falls short in that category too.There is a great action scene at the start of the movie, but that is it in terms of actual fighting. Rongguang Yu (theIron Monkey) has a cameo as a hitman and I was unimpressed with this shoutout. This movie is a complete failure.2/5"
4,No Psych Major,"This is a good overview of some of the prog-psych bands of the late 60s and early 70s. My favorites are Bonzo Dog Dooh Dah Band - ""The Equestrian Statue"" and Van der Graaf Generator - ""A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers"". Renaissance - ""Island"" and a Soft Machine video are also great. Gong - ""Radio Gnome"" is a suitably bizarre video."
5,"Puppy and me, fun to read!","I enjoy reading this book with my two year old. He loves puppies and seems to enjoy the way both the puppy and he are the stars of the book. We read Goodnight Moon before bed and save the Puppy and Me books,""Going to the corner"" and ""Bath Day"" for daytime reading. I am buying ""Breakfast Time"" for my friend at work with a little girl age 18 mos. She told me she misses having breakfast during the week with her daughter and will read it to her on weekends after breakfast as kind of a celebration. The child in the book looks like a boy or girl, any child can feel the book is about themselves and Puppy!"
4,Helpful and Clear,"Well-written and geared toward beginners--which made my life a lot easier! This book was actually far more comprehensive than expected. Clarity about how to actually start an eBay business, with great tips and detai. Also works as a business guide in addition to showing a great understanding of eBay. If you are serious about getting into an eBay business, I would highly recommend this book"
1,Defectuve Book,The Index in the back of this book is incorrect. The author and publisher are aware of this...I contacted each and they confirmed this. Thus this book is worthless for anyone who wants to look things up....it should be taken off the market and corrected.
4,Pimpin' Ain't Eazy,"This is a good book, it is about the many experiences a black youth goes through to become a man, ayoung man growing up poor wants to be rich and decide that tha way he can accomplish this by becoming a pimp, and a the peak of his game he is tring to fight a drug addiction, but this story is told very truthfuly. this book tell about the things we don't want to hear, the way that the pimp's world works. I highly recomend this book be cause it is so truthfull in its content."
2,Depressing,"The first few chapters of this book were really good as the author talks about how the main charater got into the game as a pimp, but as you get deeper off into the book the author seems to be more focused on telling how the main character's real motive for pimping is to support his drug habit. But I must admit the main character does have a good mouth piece, and the author keeps your attention with slang being used."
3,Iceberg wannabe,"This book is obviously a con by a self professed con man. This book has a small merrit in that it does let you see some old cons that may prevent you from being a victim of a similar con in the present, but beyond that the story itself is nothing more than an egomaniacal con job. The some of the events are totally unbelieveable, and obviouly fraudulent. The price (...) is slightly more than this book is worth. Read Iceberg Slim instead of this (...)."
5,She's a genius.,"Carol Emshwiller knocks my socks off. She takes the bizarre and absurd and makes them universal, often funny, and sometimes very poignant. Some of the themes in the stories include paternal/maternal love in a nuclear age, reversal of victimization, and what it is to be human or humane. She experiments successfully with science fiction and gothic tales. This was the first book I've read by her and I was shocked I hadn't read her before. She's been writing for over 30 years. Of her other books I've only read The Mount, which was also good, but this collection of short stories is written tightly and is really moving. I read the collection about five years ago and three of the stories are still stuck in my head and I think about them frequently.Comparable authors might be Margaret Atwood with her past collections of shorts and more recent fiction Oryx and Crake, and George Saunders, with his dark and funny short story The Semplica-Girl Diaries."
2,"original, but...","well, this book gets two stars for trying to be original, but i found it to be a little bit too elementry. the writing falls flat in many places, making short stories boring, which is hard to do. i only found one of the short stories to be of any interest, and all the other ones seemed to be the same story again and again, particularly in the middle. i advise reading some ray bradbury short stories if you're interested in alienish things, instead of this book."
4,lee driver,"I love Sandra Tooley books! all of them! i think its awesome that she still lives close to the place she called home most of her life and she continues to write about the area! i live in the town where the Sam Casey Mysteries take place and i love trying to figure out where things are that she talks about! I have not read Destiny Kills yet, so i cant do review on it... but if its anything like the others it will b fabulous! Lee Driver books are based in the area of Indiana surrounding the little town she grew up in and the area around where she still lives.... i love that"
2,Might be good for teenagers,"I couldn't get past the first third of this book. I tried, but to me it read like a book written for a teenager by a teenager. Good heavens, a young woman who turns into a hawk (and apparently a wolf as well, but I didn't get that far), the most stilted dialogue imaginable, cliche after cliche, and character development apparently not something the author chose to consider. I would have given it only 1 star, but I think Lee Driver deserves some credit for at least trying. Needless to say, I don't recommend this book, unless perhaps you're under the age of 14 and very gullible."
4,Fun toy!,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday and he absolutely loves it! Elmo and Cookie Monster talk while your child is trying to put the shapes in the right slots. My son also loves the music that plays! The only downside to this shape sorter is that the shapes are not your everyday things, like circles and squares. There is a piece of pizza, a carton of milk, a school bus... Nevertheless, my son still loves this toy!"
2,Not that great...,"I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She loves Elmo so I knew it would be a big hit. I ended up returning it though because to get the shapes through the holes, even I had to smack them with my fist to push them through. My daughter quickly figured this out but kept pinching herself in the process."
4,historic perspective,this book is an excellent pre-Web look at what hypertext could have been. web designers want to look at your roots? this is one way.
3,Brethren reproduction,"As I outlined in Brethren Life and Thought in the 1980s, the book assumes a desire to reproduce values in children by letting them space - but not too much space. For example, Mack takes criticism for MackII's involvement with Ephrata, while Sarah Right Major takes the heat for her teenager son being too homsick. In one sense- this of limited interest- within the Church of the Brethren. But the model for parenting isn't really sectarian- or any different from the surrounding community. Conner (my uncle) does not fully explicate his assumptions about what is good childrearing."
5,Here is why is is the best Sci-Fi:,"While I can't speak to the science of Sci-Fi, I can say this: the characters are real, living and breathing people. The creator of this series was meticulous in fleshing out the characters and they all have believable personalities and motivations. This is not Star Trek. Characters are not racial archetypes, nor do the episodes end with joviality and a learned object lesson for all. This is a dark universe, with tangible evil and realistic good. See this series, give it a chance and let it engulf you. You will be glad you did."
5,Nice to Capture on DVD,I love the Babylon 5 story for its great acting you can just see how well the cast gets along. I also how they develop the story over the 5 years along with their ability to use Judaism/Christianity/Islam in providing good moral lessons.
5,Need boxed sets!,"I agree with several other reviewers that this series needs to be released in a ""box-set"" format. I've started a discussion at Warner Brother's website regarding this. (I'm sure this isn't a novel idea, but its about all I can think of doing right now to help the cause.) Please post a message there if you're in favor.I initially didn't care for the series because of the acting...but when I concentrated on the special effects and storyline, I really got addicted! =)I think it was TBS that repeated the entire series, and I tried to keep up with it, but I missed many episodes. I want them all so I can view them in sequence. It's really a good series.Just an opinion,umightthink"
3,"""The Gathering""--2 stars; ""In the Beginning""--4 stars","""Babylon 5,"" the story of war and political intrigue aboard an Earth space station, is one of the best TV series ever produced in the US, with an epic sweep and five-year story arc that developed situations and characters in unexpected ways and brought it all to a satisfying climax.One could never have expected such quality after viewing the substandard pilot episode. I saw the pilot when it was first aired; it left such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't give the series a chance until well into its second season. The plot is uninteresting, the dialogue is clumsy, and the acting is stiff.""In the Beginning,"" on the other hand, is better than most motion pictures. It should not be watched by those who are unfamiliar with the show, however, because it gives away many plot details that were revealed slowly over the course of many episodes."
3,"Wow, what happened?","After reading ""A Veiwer from USA"" post, I felt compelled to write my own review.While everyone has an opinion I don't think the quality of the show is what people where looking for in the way of review. So instead of mentioning Star Trek's infamous formula machine like writing or Jar Jar Binks, I'll move on to my review.The DVD was extremely disappointing. Not because of the lack of extras but because of the horrible transfer to DVD. Whoever mastered this should be paddled with a tennis racket of large size. The sound pops and grain of the picture are inexcusable for a DVD transfer. I bought it because I'm a fan, but I wonder if JMS is happy with the transfer? We will never know probably.It's worth it if you are a fan. Otherwise, I'd wait till they release the ""Super duper special version completely remastered"" version. You know they will."
5,The Only Game in Town,"Aah, I know you. You have crammed as many episodes of this revered series onto videocassette as you could catch. But now you want more - you want DVDs. Sure, you tell yourself that with your computer and a bit of additional techno-frippery you can transfer those analog recordings onto disc. But this is a great deal of trouble and you are left with recordings of disappointing quality. So until the bean-counters wise up and issue the entire series on disc, this DVD and only this DVD is your last best hope for peace. You may consider ""The Gathering"" as the -B- side. It is a less than meticulous transfer and of interest only to the truly faithful. Buy this disc for ""In the Beginning"" and you will not be disappointed."
3,Worth the money for most fans,"If you are a Babylon 5 fan, its worth the investment. However, the pilot episode is sad compared to the final product of Babylon 5, and shouldn't have been on the DvD, in my opinion (Or Have it be two separate one-sided DvDs, which always with good artwork look 10 times better). There is a strong lack of special features, which in my book is a big no-no."
3,Interesting but not the best B5,"Babylon 5 only came into its own with Series Two, when it became apparent that here was something new, something exciting, something that would become known to devotees as ""Star Trek for grown-ups"". Series One had its good episodes and established some of the themes of the epic tale that would cover the whole set of series, but quite a bit of it was pedestrian. ""In the Beginning"" is half way between the two - well worth watching but if you don't really take to it (and many will take to it) PLEASE don't let it put you off exploring the rest of the B5 universe -it really is something special."
2,DVD? More like VHS on Disc.,"That's pretty much what they did. They somehow just COPIED the EXACT contents of the VHS onto a DVD.I only gave the TWO star because the 2 movies. The rest of the stars should've been from the DVD itself. The quality, the sound, and the extra features. All of which (to me) are UNACCEPTABLE, for a DVD.Come folks!!! GET IT TOGETHER!!! Geeez... How HARD can it be to fix up the sound a little bit, clear up the picture, and give us some features? ...I kept asking myself WHY I paid so much for this ""VHS on a DVD disc""?My only answer is my love of Babylon 5 the series itself.Actually I take some of that back. It's not a ""VHS on DVD"" because the picture is even BETTER on my VHS than it is on this DVD. The DVD is just WAY too grainy, and much too dark in some parts. As for the sound..... ha ha ha. Sounds better when I MUTE it.If I wasn't so into Babylon 5, I wouldn't have bought this DVD - knowing what a terrible job they did with it. (They used the cheapo case, too)"
5,Great supliment to seasons!,"First off if you're new to B5 I dont' suggest starting here. Even if it does include the Pilot. ""In the Begining"" I feel gives too much away. Part of what made B5 great was the slow unfolding of the story like peeling away many layers of an onion.As for extra features. I really don't care. I own over 50 DVDs and have never watched or cared about the special features. I buy a DVD or VHS for one reason. I want to own the movie/show on it, special features are nice but I won't count off for the lack!"
2,This is a great injustice,"This is a great injustice and insult to all B5 fans. Bravo to WB for creating a piece of (...) DVD for the greatest Sci Fi series ever made. I won't repeat all that's been said before it will just annoy me even more. If there were separate ratings for the DVD and what's in it, I would give the DVD 1 star and the story 5 stars. The WB execs must not have their own DVDs because it looks like they don't know how to make one."
2,"Great film, awful DVD transfer","I have been waiting so long to see one of the greatest stories to ever hit the TV come to DVD that when I got it I rushed home and turned on the DVD player and waited to be amazed. The transfer was worst that VHS. By now I am convinced that someone in WB doesn't like B5, since these days even a B movies transfer is far superior to this DVD.I just hope some one in WB has a decency to have the transfer for season one box set (set to be released this fall) done by some one other that a summer intern."
2,This is the first and last B5 DVD I'll buy,"The DVD manufacturers are doing to us what they did for first the Star Trek original series and then the Farscape fans -- empty our wallets. How can you be serious about releasing just 2 per DVD? I will not collect any more new ones. I liked the series, but it costs too much to own."
3,Lack of Widescreen on The Gathering,"One has to wonder why they released this disc with The Gathering in Pan and Scan and not widescreen. Perhaps by doing this WB was hoping to appeal to the people who wonder what all the commotion is over stereo sound on TVs and who would run a 21"" monitor at 640x480 resolution. Oh well, I guess we owe thanks to all the people who feel that if something is in widescreen they are getting cheated. I hope that if the rest of the series is released on DVD that it will be in boxed sets and widescreen, but somehow I feel that won't be the case."
5,Babylon 5: The Gathering/In the Beginning,"A must have dvd to view the beginning point of the series.There are some different characters and appearances of the cast,which changes when this great series hit the air waves, but it doesn't change the theme for the series"
4,Just missed the target.. but it was close,"Ok. Loved it but it was missing bell's and whistles which normally come with a DVD (commentaries, deleted scenes and so on).I'm pleased to have this one in my collection. The sound and video was good. I only wished they had released more of these to DVD by now (what are we waiting for???). I know many who would jump on it. I'm buying the Star Trek TNG DVD's as they come out (Season 3 July 2nd!!!) I'll be there in a cold minute should B5 make DVD.I've already called WB. They mentioned there were no plans to release the rest on DVD. I asked ""Do I resort to downloading them from the Internet?"". I was told that while they have no plans, they are discussing the possibility. Hopefully more information as what they plan on doing :-)Awaiting anxiously."
4,"A Splendid Introducton To Babylon 5, But...","I concur with other customers who agree that this DVD is inferior in quality to much of what is out there; for example, compare it with the new director's cut of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". Hopefully Warner Brothers will ensure a higher quality standard as it releases subsequent volumes in the ""Babylon 5"" saga; which many rightfully regard as the finest science fiction television series ever aired. Still, those who aren't familiar with ""Babylon 5"" may be pleased with this CD, since it introduces Earth Alliance space station Babylon 5 (""The Gathering"") and tells an epic tale about the infamous Earth-Minbari war (""Babylon 5: In The Beginning"") which led eventually to the construction of Babylon 5."
4,What's up with WB DVD's?,"I can't believe that WB put about 3 hours of TV onto two sides of a DVD. With the only benefit being the jump to scene selection. With all the specials that have aired on B5 you'd think they would have put SOMETHING on here. I really hope that they at least fulfill minimal expectations by releasing the entire series a season at a time. If they make me buy this series 2 episodes at a time, I'll boycott the entire experience and trust in my video tapes."
1,Very disappointed,"I can't express how disappointed I am that this great series isn't being given the great treatment it deserves on DVD. Where is the seasonal boxed sets like The X-Files, SG-1, and all the others? Instead we're getting two episodes at a time...with box art that will probably change every three releases so none of them match. Are they widescreen? Are the DD5.1? I hope so, but don't have the info.Note that Warner Bros. is releasing the DVDs. WB makes the worst DVDs on the market in all facets: audio, video, packaging, extras. I have little hope for these DVDs. :-( I wanted complete seaons of the DVDs, instead we're treated like ST: TOS fans."
4,Very Good Read,"I really liked this book. At first I wasn't so sure but once I got into the 3rd chapter I was hooked. This book's storyline can get a little crazy at times but never confusing. I was happy with this book from beginning to end. Very quick, easy, and good read."
3,Murder in Massachusetts,"Sarah Deane is an ongoing character of author J.S. Borthwick. She is a strong young woman whose personality is developed more and more with each succeeding book. The mystery in this book is pretty good, and suspects and red herrings abound. However, in the end I felt somewhat cheated. Sarah, the main character, does not solve the mystery. In fact, none of the characters solves the mystery. The villain is finally caught in the act, and the last major clue, which would have allowed Sarah (and the reader) to solve the crimes, is not revealed until after the murderer has been arrested. I have been noticing this kind of thing recently with amateur sleuths, and I must say that it is a trend that I do not like. Still, this book is well written and a fun read."
2,How she killed the French language,I do not understand how an author can write about a French teacher who is a stickler for perfection and then not have an editor who has some modicum of French. Most of the French words and quotes have blatant errors. Do American readers not care? The story is too lightweight and the plot too contrived.
3,Blossom Culp,"I thought that this was a so-so book. It was a very fact-filled book and the author clearly tried to make this book good,but it is defiantely not a Newbery. Enjoy reading the book, as some hate it and some like it."
3,AN EGYPTIAN QUEST THROUGH TIME AND SPACE,"Blossom Culp is an unlikely heroine: living hand to mouth in dilapidated quarters, with a light-fingered mom who scrounges food and items to sell in the dead of night. But she is also one of the few freshmen at her school with ESP. Yet not even Blossom could have predicted that she would be chosen as the natural contact (medium) in this world and time for the spirit of a wronged Egyptian princess!Blossom and her mom live (more like squat) in squalor on the wrong side of the tracks in a small town in 1914, when women did not have the Vote. Then a new History teacher sails into town and quickly gets both her class and their mothers into an uproar. And just what ancient secret was left hastily forgotten in an old traveling show tent? Does Alexander have what it takes to join a high school fraternity with dare-devil initiaion rites, while Blossom is ostracized by the girls? Clever plot and zippy dialogue combine to make this a fun read."
2,Still looking for a GOOD story,"The hero buys a car worth 200,000 euros but blows all his gaskets because his lover has 7,000 of debt?!?! A little perspective here, please. I got tired of the author spending so much time on the cost of everything.I liked the heroine until she decided she had nothing better to do than be pampered and groomed and dressed for her lover's pleasure."
2,A Romance Jumkie,Cesar was the rich handsome Spanish alpha jaded male. Roslind was the English beauty with secrets. The secrets were not what Cesar thought which made Ros leave without saying goodbye. There was no warming up to these two. I did not hate them they were just boring. The story had no conflict and I was flicking kindle pages at the speed of light.
4,great value,"Looks good, great price= gret value. I would change the yellow background to an eggshell finish, instead of the high gloss finish. the crown has tiny ""crowns"" I would remove. Overall, a great value. The small print it is a little bit too crowded, but there is no way you can fit all that info in such space."
2,Interesting story mangled by poor plotlines,"This book has tremendous potential--delving into the life of an elderly woman who's shown up at an insane asylum in a near-catatonic state. But what ruins the story is, quite simply, the writing. Characters--such as Alice's violent boyfriend--surface once, have their dramatic moment, and then never return again. This seems to be a trend in the execution of this book. Sedgwick frequently introduces interesting and dramatic elements, but then leaves them hanging in space and takes the ""easy"" way out. Thus, the book ends in mid-air, with a lot of loose ends, and not much substance beyond everyday pop psychology. Best to leave this book behind and instead pick up a psycho-thriller like ""In the Cut""."
2,Psychiatry - the tabloid version,"This book was a major disappointment. Flatly written, with editing errors even in the names of medications, this book displayed a depth of ignorance about psychiatry, psychiatrists and contemporary psychotherapy. As an experienced psychiatrist, familiar with McLean, the hospital which is described in the story in slightly disguised form, I can assure the public that junior staff are thoroughly supervised, have no time to run around playing detective and would not be allowed to violate boundaries between professional and personal in the way depicted.What about poetic or artistic license, you may ask...Well, for that argument you need a work of art, which I would argue this book is not."
2,Product Not What Was Advertised,"The product description said the case was to have had: ""a removable flip cover, which safeguards the iPod click wheel when closed but offers full access to the controls and ports when open"" and a ""reinforced money-clip-style belt clip"". The product description also states that it ""Features a scratch and dust resistant screen for maximum protection.""--the case had none of these features. The case, itself, is okay, yet way overpriced for what you don't get. Quite a disappointment!"
4,Essential for new pc,"Item works well, but is a little noisey. PC runs runs cooler. Last 2 PC's have had mother board issues that appear related to poor connections damaged by heat."
5,Thrash insanity!!!,"OMFG!!! This album blows away any other album back in the day!!! The riffs are out of this world, riffs there, riffs, riffs, riffs, ....very close to ""Time does not heal"" by Dark Angel. Theres also a good musicianship with good drums and excellent vocals and the solos, ufff man, incredible!!! Recommended if you like: Dark Angel, Slayer and Faith or Fear."
4,Hard-To-Find Solid Album,"Took me a while to find this one but it was a fairly worthwhile purchase. While I am not currently ""blown away"" by this release as I have only listened to it once through (I just got it an hour ago), I think it will be one of those ""sleeper"" classics. The riffs are great and the singing is well done. A few more listens and I will most likely be unable to understand why I didn't get this one years ago. This version is the 1999 Century Media Reissue with remastered sound and bonus tracks."
1,Does not charge,Maybe I was sent the wrong cable because the one I got came in different packaging as pictured. The cable does not charge as indicated in the description.
2,only buy this if you want to add to your collection,another traitor to shaolin. a general betrays his friends to become his slaves. fight scences are very basic.
5,The Shiznit,"This movie started my collection of movies with Ti Lung. He is an orchestrator of martial arts. His strategy in this movie is to train his brothers in kung fu while he is deceptively scheming on the grand prize, the removal of the corrupt emperor and his crony government. Ti Lungs knowledge of cinema and acting create the perfect chemistry for any Martial Arts fan! The facial expressions, the tragedy, the mistrust and the triumph makes the title more symbolic>Ti Lung got skillz! This movie also known as ""The Wutang Clan"" should be in every fight fans collection"
1,weak,"I might be able to enjoy this film, if it weren't so choppily-edited and badly transferred. The audio is equally horrible, occasionally blaring and then fading out altogether. Bad, bad transfer - hopefully it will get re-released in a more watchable form."
2,"Okay movie, very bad tape","Nothing to do with Wu Tang (none of these films do), but a Wu Ma film about a treacherous Shaolin student (Ti Lung) who, through torturing his fellow pupils, actually strengthens them so they can attack the evil Manchu overlords. Pretty interesting plot for a traditional kung fu film; the fights are very traditional and do not rely on wire tricks. However, the quality of this tape is very bad, with lots of jumps, discolourings etc. Otherwise it would have earned 3 stars."
1,Who gave this the ok?!,"I didn't get past 10 minutes before I had to turn this movie off! I have no idea if the movie itself is good or bad, but this transfer is absolutely horrid! It's so damn blurry you can't even make out the characters' faces! Don't even bother RENTING this abomination. Another dud stamped with wu tang's name."
5,Rice University Computer Science Technical Report 86-41,"This 64 page work, published in September 1986, is also known as Rice COMP TR86-41. It is a proposal to build a parallel software laboratory called Parasol. It proposed a loosely coupled multiprocessor (LCMP) for research into large-grain parallelism, and a shared-memory multiprocessor (SMMP) for research into fine-grain parallelism. Another component of this proposal was to leverage the faculty assembled at Rice to research parallel software technology.The principal investigators were Robert Cartwright, John E. Dennis, Robert T. Hood, J. Robert Jump, Ken Kennedy, and Willy Zwaenepoel.Contributing investigators were Guy T. Almes, Robert E. Bixby, Hans-J. Boehm, C. Sidney Burrus, Keith D. Cooper, R. J. P. de Figueiredo, Don H. Johnson, Charles B. Lawrence, Lori L. Pollock, J. Bartlett Sinclair, William W. Symes, Richard A. Tapia, Linda M. Torczon, Peter Varman, Mary F. Wheeler."
5,"Eveything you need, nothing you don't!","I've found that most financial books are either overly simplistic overviews that are rarely more informative than a pamphlet or are filled with arcane academic information that is not put into any useful/practical context. This book does a fantastic job bridging the gap. It begins with an excellent overview on how the markets work, then moves into practical strategies, with an emphasis on which indicators are likely to be most helpful. It's easy to read, in part due to the author's personal touch. Definitely not dry.To call this book ""largely pedestrian"" is pompous and petty. If you're new to futures or at an intermediate trading level, do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
1,commodities 101 very basic,"I just received this book yesterday (7/7/2012) from Amazon. So disappointed in the content. If I had looked at the book in a book store I would never had purchased. Very basic information, and much is very out dated and not help in todays market. I pulled a book about Commodity Trading from our book shelf which I had purchased in, probably, 1992. Some of the content had been updated, but nothing meaningful to anyone who trades future contracts. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I'm going to try and return to Amazon."
2,opinion,This was more a book on the author's philosophy rather than a 'how to' book which I was looking for.
3,A Very General Book on Commodities Trading,"George Kleinman's book is an okay book on ""general trading"" practices but does not delve into details on any specific techniques. The Most Valuable Technical Tool (TMVTT) is the moving average. Use the TMVTT to help determine trends and trade with the trend. Now that I disclosed the most specific technique in the book, you no longer need to buy it."
3,"Good for pronunciation, not much else.","This is actually a good way to learn (any) spoken language. You can easily listen anywhere you have a CD palyer and learn something.But pronunciation is where it stops, at least for me. I bought this course, as well as the ""Teach Yourself Norwegian"" book/CD combo. Pimsleur only has 10 lessons, and only in the 10th leasson do you hear anything beyond the present tense (simple future). Truthfully, there's not much vocabulary there either, although the vocabulary that is presented is a good representation of the full pronunciation of the language.The other course I purchased, on the other hand, immediately give s you a decent vocabulary set, and quickly.In short, it's a good pronunciation guide, but I wouldn't purchase Pimsleur on its own. It definitely needs to be supplemented with something more comrehensive."
4,Norwegian CD by Pimsluer,"This program is by far the best way to learn a language. It does not cover a lot of ground for 10 lessons, but when you are done, you know it backwards and forwards. The biggest problem is that it is verbal only, so you never know if what you are saying is really correct. I would say that this is a ""must have"" for anyone learning the language, but do not rely solely on it- use it in conjunction with other learning tools (books, cd's, etc)."
3,novelized version of movie,"Recently watching the credits rolling on ""Red Heat"", one of my favorite Schwartzenegger films, I caught the message: ""Read the Avon Novel."" Why not -- since Amazon so conveniently carries it used? Fine's book is typical of the trash-novelization of popular screenplays: hastily-penned, seemingly without much concern for typos or clunky prose. But it's fast-reading and entertaining, and so true to the movie I could ""hear"" Arnold's accent and Belushi's sarcasm. Plus, it elaborates on scenes cut from the final version of the film, clearing up a few disconnected plot points. You'll find out why Ridzek has a reputation as a screw-up. And a little more background into the character of the laconic Captain Danko. Too bad the footage was scrapped of Vanya taking on the champion of the Joliet Prison gang! If you love the movie, or just want some light, fast reading, you might enjoy ""Red Heat: the Novel""."
5,didnt expect this,well ill admit im not a big taproot fan. but ive liked them since the beginning just never bought an album i would just burn them. i have there first 2 albums copied.so i did the same with this one. but dam i loved it so much i tossed the copy and went out and bought it. i love this new album its great. to all the nu-meatl haters go f*cK yourselfs.
2,Does anyone else think they've changed for the worse?,"To be honest, I really am trying to like this cd. I'm listening to calling right now to double check that it still sucks.I don't understand why everyone is praising this album. I can get over the fact they left behind their screaming and metal guitar... even the odd metered rhythms i can get over. However, that is why I liked them before, that is what made them unique and stick out of this crowd of pop rock on the radio. But to switch to four chord progressions unanimously throughout the album? I'm pissed that I even spent 10 bucks on this cd. They've lost their talent. I hear more emotion in Leonard Nimoy's sings the blues. The drums are no more intricate than the bands i saw back in high school at battle of the bands. i can't pick out what the bass player is doing because he's doing exactly the same thing as the guitar.Change is not always a good thing."
4,"so far astray from ""gift"" but a good rebound","taproot have been one of my mainstay bands since discovering them in 2000.""gift"" put me into ecstasy and when ""welcome"" hit in 2002,i was thoroughly disappointed.over produced,too many overdubs,wayyyy to experimental..just didnt dig it.so here returns steve,mike,phil,and jarrod for their third album ""blue sky research"",in which they spent hard time writing over 80 cuts and spending time with billy corgan to create a new sound for the group.the band use different methods, like a swing beat on ""promise"",a jazzy type rock beat on ""i will not fall for u"", and alot of great singing from steve.the band have all since erased their rap metal roots and are sticking to more commercial accessible songwriting,which they succeed in doing without abandoing their dignity.call it slow or tired,but this taproot disc will be heard worldwide,as it offers more of what people wanted without ditching too many old fans in the process.welcome back taproot!!!"
3,And further down they slide,"I was looking foward to this album for since I first heard about it. Finally got it a couple days ago, been listening to it a bit since but I must say it really hasnt grown on me like I tried to force it to. It just is a weak effort from such a talented band, it's disapointing at the best. Taproot had a unique style, they were distorted heavy melodic and interesting. This cd is boring, uninspiried and plain, there are a few stand out songs that remind you of the old flavour but the rest all sound the same, same tone, grungy crap. Listening to their cds from Something more than nothing to Gift to Welcome and now this you can see their gradual change fromt he style, Gift being the prime effort. Welcome was good but I was starting to miss the old sound even though it was still there a little bit but this CD really blew me away I can't believe they lost it all together."
3,average,"Listenable, but slightly above average at best. Nothing really makes this stand out as original or amazing. It's not bad, but just doesn't excite me.PS. Try The Birthday Massacre - Violet :) for something different and standout."
2,What happened?,"Short and sweet: better than Welcome, but still far worse Gift. They need to get rid of Toby Wright and try to make something original. Probably too late for that now...oh well at least i have another $12 coaster.............."
2,"gave them a two, but only because the remind me of AIC in certain parts","Once again more mind-numbing corporate pre-packed for your little simple minded listening pleasure. That is all that needs to be said but I will try and add a few more things to fill this review out. Well lets see did I mention mind-numbing, yes sorry about that I think all of this crap I have forced myself to listen to today is finally getting to me. For anybody out there that wants to break away from teeny-bopper rock please for f*cks sake checkout these bands. HELMET,BAD BRAINS,MELVINS,CRUMBSUCKERS,SLAYER,METALLICA'S FIRST TWO ALBUMS,JIMI HENDRIX,RATM,BLACK FLAG,ROLLINS BAND,ENTOMBED,SOUL COUGHING,SONIC YOUTH,CROWBAR,BIOHAZARD,CLUTCH,GRUNTRUCK,PANTERA,SUICIDAL TENDENCIES FIRST THREE ALBUMS,NEOROSIS,QUICKSAND,MC5,FOR SOME NEWER STUFF JOHN DILLENGER ESCAPE PLAN,,,,,,,,,,SH*T MY BRAIN IS CRAMPING UP TO MUCH REVIEWING TODAY.FOR MORE ON SOME GOOD NEWER STUFF I WILL ADD THEM TO MY PAGE OF REVIEWS SOON!!!!!!"
5,Unbelievable album,"This Album is an incredible creation for Taproot. I had huge expectations for the album because of my love for their first two records, and they blew my hopes away. The album is better than I had even hoped. I put the CD in my player on the day it came out and it has not been removed since, over a month ago. I honestly cannot understand any of the bad reviews I have read....it just doesnt fit. Did those people have the wrong disk? I dont get it. I would recommend this album to everyone. Its awesome!"
3,"Don't Buy this on Impulse, try to get a listen to it somewhere first","I don't have a beef with taproot, except the fact they wonder why they only sold 100,000 copies of this album. I will tell you this, they have changed a whole LOT! What attracted me to Taproot in the first place was the gripping personal lyrics and the heavy dropped distortion. If you are a fan of their first two albums you will be shocked and probably let down by this disc. Once again I'm not saying its a bad record, it's just very different."
1,"TAPROOT,GONE SOFT","This is what every good band seems to be doing these days,going soft. If you loved taproots last album like i did,then you will probably hate this piece of s$&! like i do too,unless you like commercial pop from a metal band. This cd is like tinfed sang some songs written by the smashing pumpkins-rubbish."
4,Good System,"This system is working well for us, of course it is better than nothing. It fits perfect in my desk drawer. The keys do hang a little long and hit the tags on the second row, but this is probably because we have all our keys on key rings."
5,"If you are reading this, trust me, go out and buy this album","2 guys from little known indie bands in Melbourne, get together, write and play a concept album dedicated to an event which most likely occurred before either of them were born and create what in my eyes was one of the top 5 albums of 2004. Increadibly lush soundscapes, great riffs and poignant lyrics almost elevate you to 1969 as the house of innocence and love that was 1969 starts to crumble at its foundations.The opening track 'The Summer of Love' invites you into the dreamy psychedelic era and before you know it, you are locked into a mesmerising chronology of the days events which get heavier and heavier by each song. Highlights are It's ok (it is not ok) with the catchiest opening riff of the year and the powerful awakening of 1970, the stark reminder of the hangover that was the 1960's and the horror of lost innocence about to unfold.Amazing stuff"
4,"Quick, easy, just a bit messy.","Guys this product does exactly what it claims. It colors your grays in a quick and easy method. But the only problem is that if you get it on your face, neck or ears it will stain for a couple days. The trick is to put Vaseline around your hair, neck and ears. Then after the shower you wont have any dark spots."
1,Gray Hair To Copper,"I've now tried several Just For Men colors. They are all good for a few days, but within a week or two the results are always the same.Copper!It'd be fine if the dyed hair simply went gradually back to gray, but no such luck. As the color fades, orange is left in its place. It doesn't matter if I use medium brown, dark brown, darkest brown, ash brown... Orange, orange, orange are the results. And each time in between i waited several weeks to grow out the previous copper before i planted a new Just For Men in order to grow a fresh crop of orange.Haven't you seen men with copper hair color and wonder why they would dye their hair that color! It's not them, it's the product!This review is for all the men who slink away thinking it must be something wrong with them or how they applied the product. No, no, and no. Should be our response. This product is not the answer for us."
1,Poor,"After contacting a rep for JustforMen, 3 weeks later I finally received a response. I was not at all happy with the new roll-on product. The rep sent me an no-reply e-mail asking me to supply a code # on the box. How was I suppose to respond to a no-reply e-mail. Extremely poor communication with this product line. Guess they do not wish to be contacted."
1,Under fill,Thought I was getting equiv to 3 in 1. Did not. Only 1 bottle; did not contain the among purchasing 3 kits would have provided. Nothing wrong with the product....just the fill amount---a rip off!Pat in Kansas City
3,Saw their TV Claims,"Just For Men Haid Color is a very strong permanent hair color that finished for me In minutes. Salon color takes much longer. I liked the results.When the gray grew in there was an stark contrast from the dyed hair and the new growth. It was obvious that I colored. I had to color every two + weeks if I wanted to keep it a secret on my head.I switched to Clairol Demi Permamnt. Now when new growth grows in, the dyed hair is gradually fading out. It is much less obvious.Also when I re dye hit it is less an issue than when I used permanent. Demi gradually washes out.I use Just For Men for sideburns and beards, for ten years. Great product.Just For Men have great packaging, instructions and containers.Whether it automatically knows which hair to dye and how much is a fantastic claim, I would not be a team of chemists to validate that as true."
1,Allergic Reaction To Just For Men Mustache & Beard Brush-in-color Gel,"I've been using the Just For Men Mustache & Beard Brush-in Color Gel for years with no problems. However, the last two applications of the Medium-Dark Brown (m-40) formula has been a nightmare. My upper and lower lips have become severly swollen and cracked with bleeding. I am also itching like crazy under my mustache and goetee. People, there's something seriously wrong with this batch of the formula."
4,great taste of Verdi and Puccini...,"strong selections from Verdi and Puccini for the opera beginner to give you a taste of the beautiful music from Aida, Rigoletto from Verdi. Madame Butterfly, Turandot, and La Boheme from Puccini. Neville Marriner conducts the powerful Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. About 57 minutes of music."
2,Not up to expectation,"This eyelash curler was nowhere near what I expected it to be. I don't know if it's because the purple pad is too squishy but every time I use this eyelash curler it pinches the corner of my lids. I've found another lash curler since purchasing this one and it only pinches my lids every once in awhile, so I know it's not just me. (Not always anyway)"
4,Very happy with this curler,"I'm Asian. With that being said, most of the curlers on the market just don't fit my eyes. I've used a few different brands, and none have achieved the result I wanted. Then I travelled to Asia, and found a good curler that fit my eyes really well, but it is way over-priced in the states, so I didn't want to spend that much money on it. My Asian girl friends told me Tweezerman curler is worth a try. The price is right, so why not?!I'm happy to say that this curler fits my eyes really well, and delivers a very good result! I'd recommend it to Asian girls like me that struggle to find a good lash curler."
3,It is an adequate curler,"I have really long eyelashes so I was expecting amazing results after reading the reviews. I just use a clear mascara so that may have been the problem as it has less substance than a colored mascara. The price is right though, if you need to experiment."
1,Worst ever!,"this is the worst curler ever!!i own about 5 and this curler took more than half my lashes, i have tried several the best are revlon and lacross also cheap.this took a lot lashes of my eyes and now im afraid to use any at all, i called the company and they were happy to take it with a refund but i have to pay shipping to send it in, UPS or USPS insured mail...i'll say stick with revlon (have bought 4 but keep loosign them, or lacross (had 3) this are all good and cheaper..."
3,"curls well, but be careful...","I was in love with this eyelash curler for about a week or two. Then I noticed my eyelashes were really starting to fall out, and all in one spot....now I have this bald patch with no lashes. It looks so weird! In all the years I've used an eyelash curler, I've never had this issue before. Be VERY gentle with using it! Perhaps I was squeezing too hard."
3,"Good fun, not super interesting","I bought this as a Christmas present for my 5 month old. At this time, she didn't like it, but then at 7 months, it is more interesting.It really doesn't teach much in the way of content except farm animals. One function it does have is that you have to make the arrow point at whatever animal it asks you, and then pull the lever again. So, there it teaches you more, but in order for you to play that game, it has to land on the square that asks you to look for an animal.This really only holds children's interests for a few minutes at a time, and I feel that although it is a good toy for what it is, it's not a great value because it's unnecessary and doesn't teach anything too important.Also, for younger than 1 year, I feel it's frustrating and hard for the child to use because it is lightweight but you have to pull down hard on the lever, causing the toy to fall over if it's not pulled straight down."
1,disappointed,"This was one of my favorite childhood toys so my daughter got it for Christmas. Half of the time, no sound comes out, it just spins. Plus it is much smaller and has too many animals."
3,"""Old MacDonald"" is excruciating to listen to. Everything else is fine.","Aside from the songs, the toy is fine. No great shakes.I advise against doing the Old MacDonald setting, because listening it will make you pray for death. Let me describe.So in normal mode, each animal gives you something like, ""The chick says *digitized animal sound*"" or ""the cow says *digitized animal sound*"". The song mode takes those sounds and inserts them into the tune, without rhythm at all. So you get""Old macdonald had a farm, e i e i o. And on that farm he had a mouse, e i e i o. With a *pause to load animal noise* *digitized animal noise* here, and a *pause to load animal noise* *play digitized animal noise* there. Here a *pause/noise* there a *pause* *noise*, .."" and so on.It's really maddening to listen to. Kijnd of like they automated a toddler hitting the same noise button over and over again."
2,My 1 year old hates this toy,My one year old keeps trying to like this toy - the potential is there - but he has difficulty holding the toy up and pulling the leaver. When he does have success his little finger inevitably gets pinched between the spinning arrow and the side of the toy. He's 16 mos old now and pretty much ignores the toy now.
2,old better than new,"My sons, now in their late 20's all played with the old see n say and loved it. The new one isn't of the same quality. The volume is poor and the voice is hard to understand at times. The random spin is hardly random as it seems to land on the same two animal pictures over and over. I realize that the new design is supposed to be better however it isn't. I would purchase one of the old pull string models over the new one. My 18 month old granddaughter played with this one time and got bored. I feel it was a waste of money."
3,Stored in a barn for authenticity?,"This was absolutely filthy when it arrived! Fine dirt and little bits of grass covered the box and the toy itself. I would have sent it back, but my little girl was so excited that I couldn't bear to disappoint her. After about 10 minutes of cleaning it off and wondering what else might be covering it, I handed it over. Turns out it is a bit too difficult for an 18 month old. She likes it, but needs a lot of help getting it to work. Unless I'm there to pull the lever, it is nothing more than a fun thing to slide around the carpet. The older version, while not as theoretically safe, was so much easier! Next time I'll be more patient and try it out in the store first."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"If I had tried this toy out before I purchased it online, I would not have bought it. In order for the sounds to work, you have to manually turn the arrow to the picture. If the arrow is at the edge of the picture, it doesn't make noise. If you don't pull the arm down completely, it doesn't make noise. My son (13 months) is not able to use it himself yet and does not seem interested in the noises it makes."
1,spins too fast,"it may talk really well, but the arrow spins too fast as if the toy was broken. on the pull string ones, the arrow was spinning at perfect speed, if the arrow spinned that fast, it was broken, I may be old fashion in the toy department, but something really tells me that the battery isn't in there"
4,"The Bunny Says""Boing?""","My baby really likes this toy. I got it for her for Xmas and she really has fun with it. She is only 6 months and she surprised me by pulling the lever herself. I like how it is smaller than the ones I remember from twenty years ago, we can take it in the car and stuff. I also like that it now has more animals and the quiz thing too. But the bunny says ""Boing, boing, boing!""? I have never heard a bunny make that sound. The one we purchased clearly says ""Rooster"" not ""Oyster"" like some of the other reveiwers complained about.I guess some of these toy devices have glitches in them somehow. Overall it was a good buy."
1,Would not recommend,"This toy is too loud, and has no volume control. The movement itself is quite loud, making a grinding noise. Add the even louder voice and animal sounds. Also, the voice is hard to understand and the overall sound quality of the songs and sounds is very poor.As soon as you point the arrow at an animal and pull the lever, it does make that animal's sound, but then the arrow randomly spins somewhere else. This is not helpful at all for teaching the different animals.The pictures are highly stylized comic kitsch drawings, I wonder if they are any good at all for recognizing real animals.My child received this for 2nd birthday, and never plays with it."
1,New Version is AWFUL- It is actually a ZERO STAR toy!,"This toy was much better when I was a kid, probably because the animal sounds matched up correctly to the picture. The handle is hard for my two year old to turn, and the arrow may point to a dog and then oink! (instead of barking!) How confusing for a baby learning animals and sounds!What a shame!!!! This could have been an awesome toy like it was back in the day. Now it is very likely to end up collecting dust and forgotten by your child.(like ours is)"
2,"too small, pinches tiny fingers",My son loves to play with this but he gets excited and grabs the spinning arrow and it pinches his finger. OUCH! I don't understand why they made this so small compared to the old simple see and say.
3,Not Loud Enough,"The See 'n Say lets our 2 year old choose from 16 different animals, 2 animal songs or the ""animal quiz."" My son especially likes the song option which either plays ""Old McDonald"" or ""Farmer in the Dell."" I like how this new model has more animals than the older version. This version is smaller and slightly easier for little hands to pull. This new model runs on batteries as opposed to the wind-up/unwind kind with the harder-to-pull lever or string.The major problem with this toy is that it simply isn't loud enough. The spinning wheel drowns out the sound of the animals. It's not even that the spinner is too loud. The toy is just too quiet even in a room with no other noise. It would be impossible to hear it in a daycare or some other louder setting.Overall, it's a good toy for teaching animals and sounds. The pictures are bright and vivid. I just wish it was louder."
5,a special child,My sister who suffers from cerebral palsy took a liking to this toy more than 15 years ago. She cannot speak herself but enjoys listening to the sounds of the animals and watching the center arrow spin. She's never grown tired of it and recognizes the toy even if she hasn't had one for a couple of years. The toy is very durable and never comes apart despite the bashing it takes in her adult hands. The lever is easy to use and requires very little effort. She learned to use it very quickly. The internal mechanics fail eventually after repeated use. This is a very safe and educational toy. It will last a long time in the hands of a small child.
5,educational and fun!,"This toy is great! Does 16 different animals sounds. Sings Old McDonald through one time. Each time using a different animal name and sound, of the 16 animals. A quiz mode to find the animal that makes a certain sound. The handle is easy to pull, for a 2 yr old anyway. He imitates the animal sounds. It uses batteries, so it sounds a lot better than the standard see n' say. The batteries have lasted long in it, 3AA."
1,"Horrible toy, good reviews for the memories","This is a bad replacement for the classic! It uses batteries so the lever is useless. It does nothing but make the sounds unaudible with extra rumbling. It doesnt need the extra page because the extra animals on the other page, the song, and the quiz are all unrecognizable. The reduced size is a plus, but the handle is hard to pull for my 2 year old. So no sounds come out since the handle didnt get pulled correctly. I remember the classic being a much better toy because it would play on all pulls, the sounds were great, and the size was perfect for laptop play. Blah, for $10 it was not worth it!"
1,A Different Story - Be Careful,Was looking for the same toy I grew up with but this one was half in size and not loud at all. Hearing the sounds are a big problem. Did not hold the childs attention well at all. Very disappointing. F-P could have made this one better - potentially taking safety too far and overiding the performance factor.
1,This is NOT what you remember having as a kid!,"First of all, this toy is very small and cheaply made. The music is hard to understand and muffled.So I remember having a similar toy when my stepdaughter was young (now 9) and even when I was young. It was bigger, had a string to pull and would make the animal noise that the the arrow landed on. It was great, and this toy absolutely does not live up to the expectations that I had, which were relatively minimal to begin with. It is actually kind of complicated, and works like a quiz instead of a simples learning toy for toddlers.Total disappointment."
1,Nothing like the one you had when you were little!,"I bought this toy for my daughter thinking it would be something like the animal noise toy (pull-the-string type - which is probably not considered safe anymore) a lot of people of my generation had when we were little. It isn't, and it also does not work well. The lever is far too difficult for a child to pull, and it makes so much noise when pulled that you can't hear the animal sound it triggers! Terrible design, poor quality, awful sound. It isn't even cheap -- but not worth it even if it was!"
3,not impressive,"This see-and-say is very small for the amount of animals on it. My 18 month son doesn't quite understand the the arrow is pointing at the animals since it is so busy to look at. He likes to pull down and hear the sounds, but the voices are muffled and can't be heard clearly with the noise of the toy handle and arrow spinning. It is ok, but not great."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment........,"My daughter (12 months old) did not like this toy. Maybe she is a little too young since the recommended age is 18 months, but even in 6 months, I think some of the farm animals will be hard for her to distinguish. I have to really listen to make out some of the sounds. I was a little disappointed at it's size, too. I remember when I was little the toy was much larger. One advantage is the flip page. It has more animals than the older see 'n says."
3,This is just an okay toy.,"This toy holds the attention of my one-year-old for just a few minutes. Some of the sounds are realistic, but the others are not very recognizable. I had such fond memories of the toy from my childhood, but this doesn't come close."
3,Not as good as I remember,"Although this new version on the See N Say definitely has more animals the saying of ""The cow says Moo"" is no more. This toy just says the name of the animal and the sound. I was so looking forward to my son hearing the same voice I grew up with but unfortunately it wasn't so. Also, it's not very loud. You have to put it close to your ear to here. It's good for the price."
2,Not what i remember,This was one of my favorite toys as a child I can remember clearly. This is NO where near as good as the old one the animal noises dont even sound like what it should and if u dont pull it all the way down the animals dont talk so my son lost intrest very quickly.
3,Like the version from my childhood better.,"I remember an older version of this toy from my childhood and thought it would be great for my animal loving 2yo DS but this verion is just okay.I understand that they had to replace the string with the lever but don't really like the other changes either. It's smaller and now has this flip page thing to add more animals which I think just adds confusion. Oh and the plastic seems cheap.As for the sounds some are a little odd and I wish they had just put the Old MacDonald's Farm music on it and not Farmer And the Dell or at least put them on separate ""spaces"" since there are so many.My son rarely grabs this but when he does he'll enjoy it for 5-10 minutes put only with me playing with him. He's 2.5 yo."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This toy was not how I remember the ones that I played with back in the 80's. The one I received was defective- for example, the arrow would land on the duck, but then it would make the frog noise. And then it would be stuck on that animal noise for the next 3 pulls. Not exactly a great way for little ones to learn what animal sounds go with what animal. This toy is a total waste- don't bother."
