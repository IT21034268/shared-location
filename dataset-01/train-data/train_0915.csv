5,"this is genuine ""live""","i love this album because i love live albums and i love hank jr.'s music. it's just like his live show , which i saw about 25 years ago. i've read several of the bad reviews...they didn't like the singing or the crowd noise among other things. to me thats what a live album is about...its raw and its genuine and its real. i would be disappointed if the artist just sang songs like they were in the studio. so its just personal preference. i'm here because i can't find my live album so i'm buying another one. to me , this album IS hank jr. but if you want clear studio sounding songs , this album is not for you. if you want to have some drinks and have fun with crazy bocephus...i like this album."
3,BAD DESCRIPTION,"WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, HOWEVER THE CD IS FAIRLY GOOD. WAS NOT UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SOME OF THE SONGS WERE ONLY EXCERPS."
1,Keep Jr in the Studio Where He Belongs,"While I like most of his recordings, this live album is a collection of about a half a dozen concerts pieced together most likely because he seems unable to completely perform some of his songs. I'm For Love (or the part he performed) was about a minute long. Stick to his studio recordings."
4,Tasty ready-to-heat Indian food,"Kohinoor Aloo Ki Sabzi is a mildly spicy shelf-stable meal that goes very well with rice and naan when the pouch is heated in boiling water. It has a good bit of oil but it separates and it is possible to pour off some of it before serving. I like to add some green beans or chickpeas to it and it is then possible to serve two people.300g or 10.53 oz.Serving 100g, 3 servings per pack. Realistically this package serves one person as is.

1,functiong,"these function. the numbers wash off within the first handwashing. they do their job, but the fact the NUMBERS washed off and left a film over the plastic doesnt really represent the function of the product. they havent cracked, if that is a plus, but they are not well constructed."
1,Not so Good Cook measuring spoons,"I was so pleased with these AT FIRST. I cook a lot and they were so easy to read.That was before I put them in a sink of soapy water. I had hand washed them before, but when I dried them this time the 1 tsp writing wiped right off. The Tablespoon writing smeared badly. I was not using anything harsh, just mild dish soap. I ended up writing in permanent marker until I can order some others."
1,writing rubs off,I bought these for the great price but after using them a few times the writing completely smeared. They still function but you have to guess which measuring spoon you're using.
2,Dont buy!,"If you want to download ringtones or send text messages, then this phone is not for you. If you need assessories or want to transfer your old contact information into the new G1000 phone, you want be able to do that either. However, if you are a business person and dont care about those features, excellent phone/pda."
3,Shocking to find...,"I almost gave up my Black Razr for this phone, but i decided to keep the phone on board with me for text communications. I do enjoy it for its processor and internet ability's, but it is bulky, the camera cant zoom, or at least i have not found out how to zoom, and i have not found any of the memory cards for the expansion slot. Other than it is an okay phone."
4,It is a very nice device,"I'm tempted to point out the number of people who have had problems with this phone also mention how they were on their 2nd, 3rd and 4th Treo. Maybe not everybody is a 'big' PDA-Phone person. No problem there. Don't buy it. But buying it, and then bellyaching about how its too big seems like... well, I just don't get it. I like everything about the phone except the plastic shell, which seems lame. Plus, and I hope I am wrong, I don't think you can upgrade to newer versions of the PPC O/S. Other then that, I love it. The 'chicklet' keys are great. Can anybody really type without a keyboard? I can't. This thing lets me get company email, personal email, and it opens most attachments. The syncing to Outlook is PERFECT. Yes, the phone is big, but its actually usable in place of a laptop. Can't really say that about most PDA-phone."
1,"Don't buy this, or Sprint!",This can't be serviced by anyone! No parts on this discontinued joke of a PC. No Batt life andno more are avail. It is a lousy phone. Difficult to access the mem card for use in any apps except backup. SprintPCS can't service it and they were the exclusive authorized source for it. If you know how to get batts for this less than $60 email me. allenbarker@hotmail.com
4,"Hitachi G 1000; great features, some glitches in operation","The first reviewer summed up great features. I have 10,000 contacts from my ACT; good news, all fit into contact list including most recent notes; bad news, phone freezes 5-10 times per day tho soft reset quickly puts it back in action. Negative is that one cannot do one-hand dialing as on a plain cell phone. I have not learned to use the voice dialing features. The Hitachi PDF manual is 254 pages very long. Also I cannot find where to buy a second cradle and power supply"
2,How to apply for and obtain an Employer Sponsored Green,Most of the informations contained in this kit are also available in many immigration web sites. The only information which was in this book but not available on line was how to apply for RIR(Reduction of Recruitment) at the labor certification procedure. Some of the information (especially about immigration petition as a priority worker) are not accurate and misleading.
2,Disappointing Range,"I was extremely excited about purchasing the V-Tech 2960ci. I have had very good luck with one of their old phones and liked the option of having an answering machine for both lines.I purchased the phone and connected it up. From one end of my house to the other (about 50 feet), the signal constantly dropped out. The range is severely limited. Going outside was impossible.My other VTech phone (2-line alpha platinum) is wonderful. I can go anywhere in my house or yard without trouble. With that in mind, I exchanged my phone for a new one. The range was still limited to a mere 50 feet.The phone is also difficult to shoulder. The cucumber shape may look cool, but it is not practical.After trying the second phone, I exchanged it for another brand, which is much better."
2,"Good features and price, but poor quality and service","This is my first electronics purchase from Amazon. It is one of the few phones on the market that had all the features I needed - and the price was quite a bit less than I expected to pay. But...1. The design is more complicated than it needs to be - not intuitive at all.2. The range is less than my other 900 MHz phones.3. The battery needed replacing after five weeks.4. The phone started goofing up after seven weeks, and, after waiting on hold for an hour, the factory said my only option was to box it up and spend the $10 to mail it in for exchange.As a result, I'm not inclined to buy any more V-Tech products - even if the prices and features are good."
2,Lousy...,"I'm returning this phone tomorrow. It is nowhere near on par with the VTech DSS corless I have. I thought at first I had a lemon, so I got another one. Same thing! The problems are numerous: The audio quality of the answering machine (incoming and outgoing messages) is awful. About as good as those digital units of 7 years ago. Garbled. The distance from the base is lousy, it's hard to tell whether you have messages until you get right up to it (very dim display), and the handset audio is lousy. VTech just didn't put the R&D or decent components into this one. It's going back to the store, and I don't recommend it. I've got 1 other VTech and 2 Panasonic cordlesses. This was the worst of the batch by far."
3,Poor Audio Quality,"The phone has many nice features, however, the quality of the outgoing message is terrible! It is worse than streaming audio over a 28.8 modem. Surprisingly, the audio of the messages people leave is fine. Also, if your callers are soft spoken, the answering machine will hang up on them in the middle of a message. However, the headphone jack, and the ability to charge a second battery in the base are a definite plus."
1,sounds better on paper,"I got excited when I first saw this phone. I wanted a 2-line cordless phone with answerer, and at the time this was the only one. The excitement wore off fast. Whenever I talked for more than a few minutes, there was terrible clicking and popping that made conversation nearly impossible. The V-tech folks (who were very responsive) said that every phone is a little different, even within the same make and model, and suggested I exchange it. I did, but the 2nd phone had the same clicking and popping. So I exchanged it again. Same clicking and popping with the 3rd phone. Then I gave up and bought something else."
2,VTech 2960 sound quality is abysmal,"The phone is easy to use and the answering machine is reasonable. The lack of a keypad on the base station can be annoying because you have to use the tiny buttons on the handset instead. The real problem with this phone is abysmal sound quality. People kept asking me to ""speak up"" and I kept saying ""Excuse me"" to get people to repeat things that I couldn't make out. And god forbid that you are taking to someone on a cell phone - reciprocal gibberish. So bad that I had to return this phone. So I cannot recommend this phone to you."
1,VTech is horrible choice for a small office,"If you're looking for a two-line phone for a small office, forget this one.First, it's impossible to turn the ringer in the handset off when you're on one line, so the 2nd phone line rings annoyingly, even with the base's ringer turned off.Doing simple programming, like resetting the number of rings before the answering machine picks up, require re-reading the user manual."
5,Shocked,"I am shocked at the negative reviews on this page. I have owned this phone for 2 years with absolutely no problems. Battery life, reception, ease of use, audio quality have all been excellent. Security is unmatched! I am buying a second one for my father. I would recommend this phone to anyone!"
5,I need to make a correction,"In my first review I said that ""This Metal Sky"" was a spoken word done by the lead singer of ""Hunzel und Gretel"" and this is completely wrong. I was given some wrong information and I'm sorry about posting misinformation. ""This Metal Sky"" is a spoken word done by Chris's wife Lisa. Everything else that I have said I hope is all true. If I still have no idea what I'm talking about, e-mail me and tell me, please. Hell, it's a great album, buy it. You'll like it, I do."
3,For completionists,"A nice little ep to compliment your Sine Wave purchase, though on it's own I really would not recommend to anyone but the hardcore Twin fans. Showcases a few of his more industrial sounding excursions as well as the the catchy final track."
3,Good introduction to noise,"I think the real value of this record is that it confirms Merzbow's status as the absolute God of noise: yes, he has imitators but they lack the killer instinct, the sense of absolute abandonment to an idea. Its got a good range of different kinds of sonic art though from more ambient, amorphous fuzz to the full on sonic assalts of Masonna and Merzbow. The Merzbow track is an edit of the full version which appears on CD 50 of the Merzbox (annihaoscillator)."
1,not satisfied at all,Purchased Lion: A Wildlife Simulation for my son's 13th birthday. To only discover that it's not compatible to my son's new computer. So he has a game he's unable to play....not a happy camper! and the seller wasn't willing to refund my money on a product we were unable to use.
5,Transcend TS4GJF110 4GB Jet Flash Drive,the pen drive is very practical with plenty of storage and transport'm totally satisfied with the purchase of Transcend 4GB Jet Flash Drive TS4GJF110
3,The Good and Bad,"This product works well, but the case is shoddy, the key ring broke in less than week and then the case came apart 2 or 3 weeks latter. However a little tape and the device still works."
1,Never Arrived!!,"What a selle!! Product never arrived and seller never answered after saying ""UPS lost all our packages over the 4th of July"". All further calls ans e mails were ignored."
4,Level 4 Pop Stars,"The kid's definitely got something here. Terrific, effecting pop music. Also: Unpretensious; clever; nostalgia-inducing; catchy; super; beautifull. This Modern Man and Time are stand-out tracks and if If I Was Your Father doesn't break your heart, you may want to consider therapy."
5,Wonderful suit and a pretty print as well,"I own this swimsuit, and it fits great. It is slimming and figure flattering. The print is wonderful. Swimsuit prints today are ugly for the most part but this is so pretty and tropical.The top fits great to size c cup as the descrition says and the shorts bottom offers wonderful coverage and figure flattery.This seller does take exchanges so if the suit does not fit you can exchange it very easily."
5,What a find!,"This novel is loaded with great erotic encounters and tells a fantastic story. I found it by accident actually from an ad in the LA Times about one of his other novels CLONED LOVE, but I was taken with this plot instead and I will go back and get all his stuff, because this writer is awesome. This is THE best Hollywood tale I've ever read and the most sexually explicit. It's handled with sophistication and the scenes are poetically written. Their get togethers are like some twisted opera. You will also love the great character development of the supporting players, who are written to be hilarious. I got a first edition, one of 1000 that he autographed, so we're just discovering this man Thorne Peters and his great book."
5,My kind of Hollywood tale.,"This is not a typical Hollywood story- superficial & commercial. The author really focuses in on the characters and allows Hollywood to be the perfect backdrop. I haven't read this author's other work, HOLLYWOODLAND KINGPIN, but after reading this book I am compelled to. The love interests for the male lead in this book are outrageous. You just won't believe some of the scenes in this book. The action is skillfully illustrated and the author has an amazing gift to conjure imagery as you read along."
4,Please get back together,"Jawbreaker is one of my top 3 favorite bands of all time and this was the album completed my collection. i heard a lot of good things about it and was very excited i guess i was a little dissapopinted at first but after repeated listens i really got into it i think that except for 24 hour revenge therapy i have had to lsiten to their albums a few times to really grasp the sounds and the lyrics for some reason. one day it just clicks and im like they're freakin geniuses.this album spans their whole career 1988-95 and its got a lot more hits than misses. i dont know why some these sings were left off of their respective albums cause they seem like qulaity cuts to me. best tracks: ""equalized"", ""split"", ""kiss the bottle"", ""sister"" ,"" friends back east"",and "" friendly fire"""
3,Sibelius from a Warm Spa,"Outside of the gorgeously recorded orchestral sound (RCA and the LSO seem to strike a chord with me, ever since Previn's Vaughan Williams cycle), this is Sibelius from a relaxing spa (or as has been suggested, a geriatric ward) -- perhaps only ephemerally and superficially evocative of rugged landscapes and savage myths, but not in the least of ""cool, clear water"". Davis and the LSO make ""beautiful music"" of these incredible Sibelian inventions in performances stripped of spontaneity and milked for all the lushness and warmth of sonority that can possibly be mustered. I'm not altogether convinced these immaculate performances even work as drama or expression, especially for the novice listener. However, one can certainly bask in the pure sound of it all."
2,Davis is disappointing,"Up until now I've always liked Colin Davis' work, notably on Berlioz, but he misses the boat entirely here. My goal in buying the record was to get a collection including the Karelia Suite with the Intermezzo, as well as Finlandia, the Nightride and other smaller Sibelius works in one recording. I based the choice on the Amazon 30-second soundbite. Unfortunately it's after the first 30 seconds of the Intermezzo that the conductor's chosen tempo becomes clear.It should sound like a high spirited procession, some what joyous and uplifting. Instead we hear something akin to a bunch of poor souls trudging through heavy snow - dreary at the minimum.Unfortunately that's the pace for the entire CD. I checked out a video of Sir Colin conducting the final section of Sibelius' 2nd. Same impression. I don't think he quite ""gets"" Sibelius. I just can't recommend this recording."
1,Karelia -- where's the snap?,"I just bought the old Davis/BSO Sibelius symphonies, based on reputation. I should have listened to them first. The performances feel lifeless, and I feel the same way about his Karelia on this recording. Do yourself a favor -- get Sir Charles MacKerras' recording of the 2nd Symphony + Karelia + Finlandia, and listen just to the Intermezzo from Karelia and compare it to this, and you will understand what I am talking about. And if you want to compare Davis to someone who takes the Intermezzo at something like his tempo, try the old Barbirolli recording with the Halle Orchestra. Even though Barbirolli is little, if any, faster, there's life in his music-making that is totally absent in Davis' version."
3,gunsmithing tools,The information was good and the video got nice close up shots. I guess I just expected allot more from this video for the money. I expected more hands-on with the tools. Way too much money for this. Feel like I got robbed.
3,Not bad for a low budget movie,"An 11 year old boy witness a older Jewish store owner getting beat up badly by a hoodlum. He refuses to snitch but the hoodlum thinks he may have (or will). The boy, Micheal, is an intelligent Irish Catholic who wants to do the right thing but isn't sure what it is. His loyalty to street rules clouds his judgment but he grows up that summer, partly due to his new friendship with a rabbi.It's a low budget movie but it's a very good one. Great acting and a good script. I cried toward the end. It's the kind of movie you want your kids to watch and I think they would actually enjoy it."
4,gateway,Very nice new technology. I have only used it as a video monitor so far. Biggest complaint is NO color level adjustment on video!! and the level seems to be too high. Adjusting brightness & contrast somewhat changes the color levels but at the expense of over compensation. Sound is poor.
4,nice for bedroom,I've owned this tv for almost a year and had no problems.colors are crystal clear.dvds look excellent.you have to keep the brightness level down though.nice for small rooms.easy to use remote.would recommend it.
4,"Dogs bark, caravan moves on","I do find diatribes like reviewer # 1 above depressing. Scientific method used to mean the attitude of Galileo's going up to the top of the tower, dropping his weights, and writing down what he observed; it now seems to have been twisted into the attitude of his critics, complaining that what Galileo saw happening was impossible because it wasn't described in the books on their shelves.I was particularly impressed, in fact, by the way that Biklen in this new book ignores the attacks of those-who-will-never-be-convinced in favour of trying to find out what we can actually learn from these people - the meaning of the severely autistic experience, seen from the inside. His delicacy of analysis is right up these with Kanner's, and his long experience in research is evident on every page."
3,Just a simple finance textbook,"An international finance textbook with a flashy name (linked to some mexican finance spotlights) in order to take marketing advantage from the lacking of serious issues published in Mexico on this subject. Nevertheless, there is no slightest reason to assume the theory is not useful for BA students. Needless to say, there is nothing new in finance matters. Alan Shapiro's Multinational Financial Management is a better choice."
4,Reaches almost up to Sevgs` Link,"The cd is one of my favorite New age cd`s, and the combination of Vertas pianoplaying along with the beloved sax, the excellent gitarplaying and the computerbased(it sounds like it) drums in the back, creates magically sound of the time line, which it is."
2,DPDT Switch,The switch worked fine but was not of very high quality. You do get what you pay for though. It's not a bad switch but I would pay more next time for a more heavy duty switch.
4,Nice value for the money,I have used the TMP-2 in the train as part of my home digital audio workstation recording set up as a way of using a tube preamp to warm up the signal which tends to become a bit cold with when recording in digital. The TMP-2 has fullfilled every expectation and has a warm natural sound I like. Well worth the money and I just ordered a second unit.
2,Does this unit do anything...,"...other than add noise to my tracks? I have been using this for over 1 year to record various instruments and various styles of music. The unit adds a considerable amount of noise and the ""limiter"" seems to do nothing at all. This product is very disappointing. I also use the Presonus Blue Tube two-channel mic pre. For a similar price the Presonus outperforms the Nady by leaps and bounds."
5,Very Nice Coffeemaker!,"This is the second Cuisinart Coffeemaker I have bought,this one is for my mom.I am very particular about my coffeemakers so if I didn't love the first one I would not have bought this one for mom.It is very easy to use and easy to program. It had to be, she's not good with instructions. Anyway the price from Amazon was way cheaper then Macy's sales prices, plus it had a rebate.An all around great deal. And it's just beautiful looking for your kitchen"
4,Replacement coffee pot,Fine machine as was the other one like it. This is a spare as the price was right.
5,Super coffee maker,Love this coffee maker. It has so many dials to work with. It's the best coffee maker I've ever bought. Nice sleek looking.
2,Cuisinart brews coffee lukewarm.,"Fails to brew coffe at high enough temperature results in poor coffee. I now use this to hold the coffee while pouring hot water through beans.This works well, but this unit is hardly automatic when used this way."
5,Foklgers,Very good coffee maker!!!! I like the way it is so easy to use. I can make as much or less coffee as I want.
5,Good Coffee Machine,"Well after 15 years with Mr. coffee I finally decided to get a new coffee maker. After doing a lot of research and reading all the reviews I decided on the Cuisinart. The coffee is wonderful. I highly recommend this one. Sure there are a few things that aren't perfect like the on/off switch, not sure why they designed it this way. None of the things I have found so far are bad. Great machine love the look."
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-C Brew Central Coffeemaker,"The coffeemaker is working wonderfully. I read the reviews prior to making my purchase, and I do not regret my choice. One of the reviews I read mentioned the difficulty of pouring water into the coffeemaker. I have found that if I fill the carafe with water and rest the edge of the carafe on the opposite corner of the coffeemaker (that would be the front left corner of the machine) I can tilt the carafe and pour the water directly into the reservoir without any problem."
4,Mostly love,"What a beautiful coffee maker. Our friends had one when we went to visit and I liked the way the pot poured. I also loved the coffee! So I ordered one the minute we got home. The one thing I'm not fond of is there is no hinge on the top of the pot. You have to snap the whole thing off and on and that is too much handling. However, I'll put up with that little inconvenience to enjoy the good looks and the good coffee."
1,Piece of garbage!,"I bought this coffeemaker in 12/10, but didn't really begin to use it until the beginning of the year 2011. It did not last even 8 months. I turned it on, and nothing happened. There is no troubleshooting section on the manual. The only thing it says is that if you press the self-clean button by accident the machine will not work. However, in my case I have disconnected and tried resetting it, but it still does not start the brewing process. The only recourse is to return it to the manufacturer with a $10 plus the additional charge of shipping to them. I think, I'll try another manufacturer, but since all of them are made in China, I think I'll get a real cheap one so I won't feel so cheated when it breaks down after less than a year.I should have paid closer attention to the more than 200 1-star reviews."
1,Disappointing...stopped working in less than a year,"I bought this coffee maker less than a year ago. It makes great coffee...until the unit stops working entirely. Yesterday it worked fine. This morning the lights come on, but it won't brew. I've read dozens of reviews online saying exactly the same thing...one day it works, the next day it doesn't. I've also read consumer complaints about this unit overheating, smoking, and having electrical shorts that could be a fire hazard. I thought by paying a bit more for a coffee maker, it wouldn't have to be replaced within a year like the cheaper ones we've had in the past. Very disappointed in this product."
4,Decent coffee maker,"We accidently ordered this coffee maker in the ""Black Chrome"" finish and when it arrived we were at first dissapointed. When we set it up however, it blended in with our other small appliances and it looked fine. Functionally it works very well. It brews the coffee fast and makes a hot and flavorful pot of coffee. The only things that keep it from being 5 stars are two design features: I am a left hander and it is somewhat difficult and awkward to fill the reservoir with water (we have yet to see a coffee maker that is easy to fill!). Second, the plastic lid on the coffee pot is a little difficult to align onto the glass cannister. Even with these few negative design features we really like the looks and use of the coffemaker."
2,Cousinart DCC-1200 - poor durability,Two year old unit started with quirky premature shutting off. Then stopped working completely. Very difficult to troubleshoot. I don't recommend this unit.
2,Not long lasting,"Although I loved this coffee maker, it was not long lived. It brewed fantastic coffee, nice features, nice looks, but..... it died in about one year, with the only way to brew was to set on Auto and reset the time to 5 min later. Could not use manual feature and it would not automatically turn off. I would have expected it to last longer and have the hot plate burn out long before the switches. My old Mr. Coffee lasted about 10 years! On to a new brand for sure, particularly at the price!"
2,"Looks good, but has problems.","It looks good and the coffee is okay, but I have encountered some design flaws. First, it doesn't fit under an average size cabinet when the top is open (you have to pull it forward). Second, condensation runs down the back of the coffee maker and onto the counter when you open the top. Third, it costs about $20 a year to replace the filters. I would prefer to use filtered water from my sink. Finally, it still burns the coffee slightly before it shuts off. I'm going back to a basic thermos style coffee maker that doesn't burn the coffee or cost a fortune to maintain."
1,Didn't last,Product stopped working after one year. Would stop brew cycle randomly and the warmer plate would not keep the coffee warm. There's no reason a product like this shouldn't last 10 years.
5,makes making coffee easy,"sleek looking, super tasting, easy to use, quiet. it is tall, but if you have the room, so worth it. love the timer aspect of it. once you read up on the buttons, nobs and gadgets involved, it's simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee. highly recommend....comes with it's own gold filter so no need to buy one as suggested"
4,this coffee maker looks as good as it works!,this coffee maker looks really good on our counter and it makes coffee very quickly; which is a huge plus in our household. The only problem i have is that it's hard for me to see down into the water well when filling it because i'm not as tall as my husband but that wouldn't stop me from buying another one.
3,Failure to excite,"For $80 I expected a quality coffee-maker. Not so with this model. It has many features, but the most important one should be brewing coffee. First, you can not substitute any paper filter for the sample one that comes with the product. If you do, the coffee overflows and gums up the machine, your counter surface, etc. Second, if the correct filter is not exactly pressed against the cone (meaning absolutely no gaps, even small ones that happen when you close the top) the coffee overflows and gums up the machine, your counter surface, etc. What a nuisance! $20 coffee pots perform better than this! Buyer beware!"
3,"good, but with a major flaw","This is a good and apparently a well-made appliance. It is flawed, however, by its internal water level guage. This makes it difficult set the level for six cups or less without having to rely on the markings on the carafe. An external guage would have been better."
4,fantastic,"I am most impressed with the taste of my cheap coffee that comes from this coffee maker. I don't know if its the charcoal filter or the brewing process, but the flower and fruity notes were present, unlike in other coffee makers I have owned. The product seems to be well made, and the on/off toggle switch is a nice touch. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone"
2,Big disappointment,"I wish I could say that the coffee this machine makes is as good as the machine looks, but it is NOT. After much teasing about the Mr. Coffee maker I had for 15 years, which made delicious strong coffee--balanced throughout the brewing cycle-- I finally replaced it mostly bec. it just looked worn. I figured that this Cuisinart should do the trick, but now I wish I hadn't donated my old Mr. Coffee to Goodwill! Even using my favorite strong German coffee, the Cuisinart can't make as good a cup. So if you're interested in something looking good in your kitchen, this is for you. If you're into tasting delicious coffee, look elsewhere."
5,Great Coffee,"We love this coffee maker. It works as well as the manufacturer advertises. Great cup of coffee. Perhaps more expensive machines work better, but no need to pay more. This works. We kept the original box and take it with us when we are traveling. No more horrible hotel coffee!"
4,Great coffee maker at reasonable price,"I bought this coffee maker two months ago and am very satisfied with it. One aspect I have come to appreciate is the plastic edging of the carafe. I hand wash my dishes and have dropped it a couple of times and if the eding was glass, it would have cracked (as it has on previous coffee makers I have owned). It's pretty simple to use and has a temperature setting of Low, Medium, High for the coffee plate. I like the stainless steel color as well. The coffee maker is suprisingly light (empty), which I prefer when moving forward and backwards on the countertop. Overall, very satisfied."
4,Good coffeemaker,"This is a good coffeemaker which was reasonably priced and immediately shipped. Just two minor issues -1. The gold basket provided allowed too much fine grinds to pass and the coffeecup had sludge in the bottom. Just changed to paper filters and all was well.2. The water level indicator is difficult to see unless there is an overhead light.Overall, though, I would recommend the product."
4,Easy to brew good coffee,"I am pleased with this coffee maker because I liked the following features:1- Easy to setup, program, clean and brew;2- The water filter to remove the water calcium;3- 1-4 cups button helping single guys to not waste coffee neither water4- Heating plate to keep coffee warm5- Auto shut off feature6- Clean alarm (never tested yet)7- Fast to brew coffeeIt does a good job brewing delicious coffee, however there is room for improvements on:1- The manual. It is very confusing and does not have many information;2- It would be nice to have some more setup features such as how strong you want your coffee;3- Thermal carafe instead glass."
4,DCC 1200 works great.,"I've used it for about one month and it makes good coffee and is easy to use. The carafe top is a little hard to get on and off, but that's not a big deal. When I make a full pot the grounds don't stay completely in the filter basket so I tend to make no more than 3/4 of a pot at a time."
4,I'm happy!,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelThis one keeps it simple and hot. The brewing temperature seems hotter than most coffeemakers, it brews clean (not a bunch of coffee grinds in the resevoir or filter ares), and it stays hot without tasting burnt (I shut off after 1 hour). It would be nice if the filter area was larger: if you use paper filter to soak up oil in coffee grinds and fill it up, the thing can overflow some grinds into carafe. Otherwise a good choice for the price."
2,Fried,I had this coffee machine for two years. One day it just let out a puff of smoke and it was all done. It's important to make sure the basket is seated all the way with a click. If not the coffee with grounds will overflow. It's a pain in the neck to clean the grounds out of the bottom of the reservoir.
5,Amazing machine with lots of settings,"Brews a killer cup of coffee. I love the 1-4 cup setting and the adjustable heating place temperature (low, medium, high). No complaints here...strongly recommend this."
1,Terrible product!,"This coffee maker worked fine for one year and then after it was no longer returnable, stopped working. Every other brand of coffeemaker we have purchased lasted for years. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for something that will last. It is also awkward to pour the water into this unit without spilling."
4,Very good HOT coffee,"The thing I like most about this coffeemaker is that it makes center-of-the-sun hot coffee. I use my coffee pot relentlessly. So, typically I burn one up in no time flat. This model has lasted longer, makes better coffee, is easier to clean and makes hotter coffee than any other model I've owned. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. Even so, it has a lot of parts so, in retrospect, I should not have expected it to be easy to clean."
5,Just bought another,"I got this as a black friday special 4 years ago. It finally died and I just purchased the same one. It's been 3 days without my good coffee! I should have waited to see if I could get it on sale again, but 3 more days w/o was too much to ask."
5,Gorgeous design and delicious brew,"The carafe is awesome - I can pour water into the machine without it spilling all over the countertop. My last coffee pot always leaked around the spout when I filled my machine.And now I'm drinking my first cup of coffee out of my new coffee machine - piping hot and so delicious! I wish I'd broken up with Mr. Coffee years ago. Like my ex, he just didn't treat me right. I like them rich and strong! (My cups of coffee, that is...)"
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","From a 2 coffee fanatic household this pot is pure gold, excellent taste and temperature, for the money you can not go wrong! Easy operating instructions and set up. Highly recommend this coffeemaker to all coffee lovers!!! My only wish if I could add or change anything is the clock does not light up, that is the only minor fault of this great machine."
3,Coffeemaker features,"So far I am pleased with my new coffeemaker with some exceptions. There is a design flaw with the coffee pot lid. The lid is not user friendly when it come to someone with arthritis & diabetes (poor use of fingers) or someone who has large fingers, which is my problem. A flip back lid is more desireable like many other major manufacturers provide. Unforunately, I got use to my former clock's display of functions. The LCD display is not easily readable, which makes a quick reference to the time of day at 1 foot away is imposible. Otherswise, I can live with this product due to it other superb features."
2,It's all plastic,"We've had the Cuisinart 1200 coffeemaker for the past 10 years. We loved it. So when it broke the other day (user error - no fault of the coffeemaker), we immediately ordered the same model. It came today and it is all cheap plastic (meant to look like stainless steel). The previous model was stainless steel and much higher quality in terms of appearance. Haven't made coffee yet - I am sure the actual coffee it makes will be fine, but really disappointed that it is not made with stainless steel anymore. The product description is misleading."
1,SCARY! Fire Hazard,"Thishas ben our coffe maker for just under a year. I am walking out of the door for work this morning, and I hear the same gurgling sound that one hears when the coffee has just finished brewing. But, this pot had been brewed a couple of hours prior. So I turn around and go peek at the coffee pot and I see smoke. I walked closer, and I smelled buring plastic. The coffee pot was off, from th auto-shutoff, according the led light, but smoke was coming out of the coffee maker. Very scary as my two teenage boys were asleep as I was walking out and Im afraid it woul of burned my house down."
1,Broken again,"I have always been a Cuisinart fan, but this model coffee maker is a total lemon. We bought one last year that worked for 3 months and then just stopped brewing. All the lights came on, but it wouldn't brew. We returned it for a new one, same model and this one lasted 10 months and did the same thing. The lady that helped me with my original return said she had the exact same problem with her Cuisinart and has had a lot of returns with this one. It must be a problem with this model because I read other reviews by people who had the same problem--turns on, but won't brew. I would never recommend it and wouldn't even consider buying it again."
2,Burned Up and Died,"I had the coffeemaker for one year and one morning the machine , while brewing coffee, started smoking and making an unusual noise. I unplugged the machine and it died.Cuisinart DCC-1200BW Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Matte Black Metals"
2,Life expectancy not worth the price,It worked OK for about ten months. Then it crapped out just like less expensive coffee makers I've tried. And the coffee wasn't any better than less expensive models. It simply does not brew at the proper temperature or within an acceptable amount of time to produce good coffee. No amount of attention to coffee bean or water quality can make up for that. A slightly more expensive Bunn replaced it. I'll never go back. Here is the url of my review of the Bunn: [...]
2,Coffee not hot enough,"Reading the reviews and the high price led me to believe this is close to a flawless coffee maker. The problem is, the coffee insn't nearly hot enough and we have to use another source to heat each cup. We've tried the highest heat setting and the 1-4 cup button which are both supposed to make the coffee hotest and nothing works well enough."
5,Filters are easy to get,"Could you place this review at the beginning of the list?? For all of you who say that you can't find replacement water filters, I don't understand??!! The product is a Cuisinart and if you go directly to their website you can order all you want of these filters (www.....com). In fact, the manual that came with my coffee maker, list all of the assessories (which includes the water filters), the company's telephone number, website, etc. How much simpler could it be?? Hope this helps everyone because I just received my order of filters 3 days later!!"
2,Warm coffee,Everything worked ok except the coffee was warm and temperature control for the heater plate seem not to vary much. I'm tired of heating coffee up in the microwave as soon as you pour it.
2,POOR LASTING POWER,"I PURCHASED MY COFFEE MAKER MARCH 5, 2010 AND IT DIED JANUARY7, 2012. NOT EVEN TWO YEARS FOR THIS MUCH MONEY. IT DOES HAVE A 3 YEAR WARRANTY, BUT WHO KEEPS YOYR BOX AND PACKING SLIPS FOR THREE YEARS????????????"
1,"Have had two defective ones, don't buy this unit!","The first one I bought was a factory refurbished unit which lasted less than three months and the pump stopped working. I wrote to Cuisinart twice, and never received a response. I was frustrated, and purchased a second unit, first quality, new from Costco thinking it was just bad luck. It lasted less than 2 days. I returned the unit to Costco, and stood behind another customer who had returned three of the units and finally purchased a Krups stainless steel model that I did also, and have had no problems. If you search the internet, you will see that there are many of this for sale as ""factory reconditioned."" I think they have a problem with this unit, and cannot recommend this to anyone. Sorry Cuisinart, I have other products in your line, and will never buy another after this experience!"
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200 - Best Coffeemaker Ever!,"About two months ago it became necessary to replace my coffeemaker as the coffee was no longer hot. I went to Amazon.com and looked and read reviews. Based upon the reviews and even though it was a bit more expensive than some, I ordered the Cuisinart DCC-1200. This coffeemaker makes the best tasting coffee I have ever had at home. I am using the same freshly ground coffee and it tastes better. A big plus is the comfortable handle and no-drip feature. It really does not drip from the pot ever. My hands and fingers never get burned from steam when holding or pouring from the pot. Cuisinart has done a great job with this one. The other manufacturers can learn from this coffeemaker."
1,"Avoid! Ours burned up after a year, melting the bottom plate.","We purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker about a year ago. We had one previously (the stainless steel version) which ceased working after about 2 years service, but it heated the water to a proper temperature to brew coffee well so we decided to try another one. We were shocked this morning (4/5/2011) when the entire bottom plate started melting and smoking. Evidently the bottom heater plate shorted out. We have proper care of this unit, cleaning it with a damp cloth and never allowing the carafe to spill onto the plate. We do not use the automatic brew function. This occurred about an hour after manually brewing coffee, and I am very glad that we were home to unplug the unit when we noticed the burning plastic smell. Avoid this unit!"
1,Fire hazard!,"I have owned this coffee maker for a few years and always thought the coffee was good. Today, after brewing, my husband heard a crackling sound, smoke was coming from the hotplate, and the smell of electrical fire filled the kitchen. I called cuisinart who offered no recourse other than to waive shipping on a new unit. I now have searched and found this problem all over the internet. I am convinced that if we were not home, I would have come home to a house of cinders."
5,great coffee maker so far,"Starting to drink coffee more and more.. Had to break down and purchase a coffee pot.. didnt wanna go super cheap, but didnt want the $80+ variety either.. I decided to try this Cuisinart.. so far so good.. easy to set timer and clock.. makes a great cup of joe, even if its 1-3 cups at a time.. my ONLY knock on it, is not being able to see the level of water that you poured from the outside of the pot.."
2,This coffee maker needs a steel caraf,I bought this coffee maker for my wife who is a real coffee nut. We had great luck with our previous Cuisinart coffee maker. It lasted five years and brewed two to three pots of coffee a day.When this item arrived I noticed that it has a glass caraf and not the steel one that came with our earlier version. This didn't fly with my wife. Coffee burns on the glass and makes the coffee taste terrible. I shelved the maker and will regift it sometime this year.
5,DCC- 1200,"I purchased a Cuisinart coffee maker a few years aqo, and returned it after a few uses. But the Bunn I had finally gave up. I got the Dcc-1200 after reading many reviews. So far it has worked better than I expected. A very good coffee maker , with out too many bells and whisels"
2,Great Coffee Maker...While It Works,"Bought this coffee maker in Dec 2010 and really liked it but now it's March 2012 and the heating unit just went out. Yes, it's still in warranty, but not sure if I want to pay for shipping, wait several weeks to get it back, and have to buy some cheap coffee maker to use in the meantime. Will probably about break even if I just replace it."
5,wish i could give it 6 stars,Bought this for my mom after she had purchased many coffee makers that worked for a day then stopped working. The price is great I feel its a steal it has been working for 3 months stron.g and still makes a great cup of coffee.
5,Love this coffee machine,I just had my first cup and it is delicious. No problem programming. Keeps coffee hot!!! I would highly recommend this machine. Water reserve is small but I had not issue with pouring water into it. Good investment at a great price.
1,WORST BY FAR,"I purchased this coffee pot in Febuary. By the following November it had quit brewing. I called the company several times reporting that my pot was shot and I needed to have it replaced. They told me for an entire week their system was down and I couldn't file a request for a return merchandise order. This is the very last Cuisinart product I will buy. I'm sure it was a fluke that it died in 9 months, however, a company that charges you to replace a defective item isn't a company I wish to deal with. This is a very loosely constructed limited three year warranty to be sure - order it if you wish, but, be prepared if it dies on you! The company is very difficult to deal with."
2,Dead after 4 years.,"Maybe 4 years is a while for some, but for me the death of my Cuisinart was premature. I had a 'Mister Coffee' for 10 years before this one, and it cost 1/3 of the price.Also the gold filter broke after about 1-1/2 years.In summation, I'm not going to purchase another."
1,BUYER BEWARE! ANOTHER FIRE HAZZARD!!!!!,"I want to add yet another story of a hot plate that started smoking and broke. I am thankful that I was present to see it, so that I was not yet another person who experienced something more serious. I tried to call Cuisenart and stayed on hold long enough to make me gives up all together. After looking at the reviews I fear Cuisenart has no plans to recall this coffee maker. I am one of the last people to complain about an item but stay away from this coffee maker! How it got sooo many good reviews is way beyond me. Maybe the Cuisenart employees all got together and had an ""amazon review party."" The coffee is okay for the year that I had it. Nothing to rave about."
3,Nesppresso is better machine,I love coffee but also value convenience. this machine though makes great coffee is not great for quick run out the door. i prefer nespresso machines making great coffee quickly and easily
1,Beware,I bought this coffee maker about a yr ago and it makes great coffee but it caught on fire this morning! There appears to be an electrical problem in the hot plate. Check consumer complaints on line and you'll see this is happening with both the 1200 and the 1100 model.
1,Fire Hazard BEWARE,"I have owned this coffeemaker for about a year now and today it caught fire while it was turned off. Thank goodness I was home and near the pot when I noticed the coffee was starting to boil and then smoke came out from the hot plate. The table it was on was scorched and the plastic burning smell lingered for hours. A internet search led me to the Dept. of Consumer Affairs and there are many complaints identical to mine. DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEPOT!!!! Throw it out. I am going to call the company, but others with complaints were told there were no recalls and would send a new unit. This is not a cheap product and is quite popular, why is this product not being yanked before someone loses their home or worst yet a life."
2,Don't Buy,"I bought this coffee maker in December 2010. About 6 months later, the clock was stuck at 12:00 and could not be changed. Then, in Jan. of 2011, the coffee maker would not work at all. The lights work, but the water does not heat and the warmer plate does not heat. I only used this coffee maker once per day. I am hoping Cuisinart will send me another one or tell me some way to fix it so I am not out $80.00."
4,Cuisinart DCC 1200 Brew,"The coffee maker has one major fault. The water level indicator is inside the water container and cannot be read. Thus, you have to rely entirely on the level shown on the carafe. It is a good product, but not much better than other coffee makers that are less expensive."
5,Fantastic Coffeemaker,"Searched high & low for the perfect coffeemaker. I think this coffeemaker comes as close to that as possible. Great coffeemaker for a fantastic price. The only thing I could say that could be improved is the clock display. It is hard to see, too small and poorly eliminated. I'm enjoying a great cup of coffee as I'm writing the review, nice!"
1,I wanted to like it but it failed.,"This is a really slick looking coffee maker. It actually worked very well....while it still worked. As with most of the one-star reviews on here, mine also failed. One day the brew light just would not go on, and it never brewed again after that. Now, I do not have enough space in my house to store all of the packaging from every small appliance I ever buy so I could not return it to Lowe's. My other option would be to send it back to the factory....however, I have done that before with Cuisinart, and of course it takes a few weeks to get a replacement. How am I supposed to go without a coffee maker in the meantime? But coffee at a local shop every day? That would add up quickly. Plus the $20 shipping (total both ways to the factory) to send it back and get another. Not worth it.I am just going to replace it with another brand."
1,Worst coffee maker ever - not kidding,This is the perfect coffee maker if you like having coffee spill across your countertop We got this as a wedding gift and almost immediately it would start spilling over when brewing. At first we just thought we weren't getting the pot set right but soon realized that it's just a really crappy coffee maker.
1,Probably won't last thru warranty period.,Cuisinart quality has nosediving thru quality reductions to increase profit.it is chinese crap with an American name!BLENDERS ARE BAD ALSO..
2,Short Lived,"I received the Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Coffeemaker three years ago as a wedding present. I had placed it on a registry based upon the positive reviews. For three years I agreed with the positives that many have professed. It is simple, good looking, and makes very nice coffee. However, I am not incorrect in assuming that a coffeemaker should last for more than three years. Mine did not. I have no idea why it stopped working or what caused it to stop working, only that it is now a brick. A brick that teases me with the fact that there is currently no coffee available in the morning. Clearly others have had better success with their units and some have had worse, but that does not change the fact that three years was too short a life."
1,do not buy this!,"This is all plastic - makes terrible coffee. If I had not thrown out the box, I would return."
5,Great coffee maker,"When it started taking our old machine 30+ minutes to brew a pot of coffee we knew it was time to invest in a new one. After doing some research we decided to purchase the 12 cup brew central. I am so glad we did. I love the programable setting and the fact that you can change the tempature of the hot plate. I read negative comments about spilling water when you pour it in the machine. As long as you pour it in slowly with the lid on the carafe you will not have any spills. The coffee brews fast and the machine beeps to let you know it is finished. It is very modern looking, and I admit the stainless steel was a selling point. I do not like to have cluttered counters, I do not mind having this sit out. Overall I would recommend this coffee maker.*edit to add 1/12/13* We have had this coffee maker for over a year now, use it daily and it is still just like brand new. We have never had any problems, I highly recommend this product!"
1,Short-lived performance!,"We purchased this coffee maker because of its positive reviews. After one year of use, the coffee maker started randomly turning itself off. As it became more and more frequent, I called Cuisinart and they tried to blame calcification. It was not the problem however. We clean the maker as well as use bottled water for coffee. Also, the feature in which the maker indicates that cleaning is needed never did operate from the beginning. For such a large brand, I am disappointed. Beware, there 3 year warranty requires you to pay $10 to have a new one sent and $10 to return. Another $20 that maybe should be invested in a different brand!"
2,Tired of replacing appliances!,"Looking over all the reviews we purchased this coffeemaker less than 2 years ago. We only use it on the weekends but really want a good cup of coffee when we have one. Besides the fact that it is difficult to pour the water in, we were basically pretty happy with it. The last 6 months we have struggled to keep it on! It shuts itself off mid brew cycle several times and again when it's done. Today we pressed the switch 8 different times before finally saying we've had enough. When we did searches it seems to be a reoccurring problem with this machine for some people. What I really want now is a good quality machine made in the USA. We are tired of everything we have made in China that seems to break down time and time again."
1,Leaks like a seive,From the day I brought it home it has leaked. A piece of crap. I'll never buy another thing from this company again.Seems leaking is a common problem with this machine. Say as far away from it as you can or buy one and send it back to China.
2,Quality has deteriorated,"I purchased this coffee maker a few months ago when my old one (7-8 years old) quit. Because I liked my old one so well, I bought another one, supposedly identical to the old one.I was a little concerned because the price, unlike everything else these days, had not increased. I should have been more concerned; what Cuisinart has done to keep the price low is to cheat on quality. The ""pause"" feature that allows one to get a cup of coffee before brewing is complete does not work. Coffee also takes longer to brew than the old version.I would have been willing to pay more for a coffeemaker of similar, higher quality. Really disappointing."
4,Fine coffee maker!,"I am very happy with this coffee maker-The Cousinart DCC-12200BCH Brew Central 12 cup. It makes very good coffee and the carafe is especially nice with no dripping. We take our coffee seriously, like it strong and this one does the job for a great price. No over flowing of coffee grounds. I got it on sale for about $60 and we are very happy with it! Only thing is it's hard to see the tiny numbers on the settings. Have to get my cheaters on to see, but that's not a big deal."
5,Super Pleased,"Ordered this product a year ago and have enjoyed it thoroughly since. Makes a delicious cup of coffee and keeps it hot. Also, it's sleek and attractive on my counter-top. Really am pleased."
3,"Looks cool, functions ok","Agree with the other reviews re: hard to get water in the right place in the top, generally messy upper areas, and especially the condensation/leaking from the lid problem. One other thing to consider: We had a small power surge in our house after a recent outage. The only appliances in the house to suffer damage were this coffee maker and a Cuisinart electronic toaster. Both apparently had their circuit boards fried and now are headed for the landfill. Maybe not a design flaw, but it's the first coffee maker I've ever witnessed dying that kind of death. Anyone need an extra caraffe?"
4,"I was nervous because some of the reviews, but","So far I love this coffee maker. High quality, good price. Say goodbye to those rolled glass spouts that dribble all over your counter. Someone complained bitterly about the cover snapping on and off. In actual use I prefer it to the hinged one I had. Complaining about the water level indicator being inside the coffeemaker just seems wrong - look at the carafe when you fill the pot! Only thing I'd change is a backlight on the clock."
1,Not a quality product,"We bought this a year ago because it looked nice and Cuisinart seemed like a solid brand. The first one we got stopped working after a few days -- the water wouldn't go through and it made lots of steam but no coffee. We figured that was an exception, got another one that worked normally for a year, then broke down just like the first one. In addition the machine doesn't hold enough coffee grounds to make a large pot of strong coffee, and a normal load of grounds tends to jam the holes in the bottom of the lid. Plus, it's hard to pour the water into the narrow little opening on the side. Poorly designed and poorly engineered.And in addition, don't get the matching coffee grinder. That broke after less than a year -- the blade literally broke off."
2,Poorly designed for price,This product has too many flaws for the price:1)Leaks water when lid on machine is lifted2)hard to pour water into3)Pot Lid is a hassle4)Top Lid starting to warp from steametc etc etc...would keep looking
1,Looks great but don't buy,"I bought this a year ago. It looks nice on the counter, gets coffee very hot, and will make one cup. That's it for the good part.It leaks. It also drips from the pot when you pour it. Terribly. It makes a mess, every time. It turns off after 2 hours. The internal filters are hard to find, outside of the internet with shipping. And,off and on,it makes TERRIBLE coffee! Chemical taste. We tried relceaning, changing filters, changing coffee. Anyway, don't set it in a place that will stain because you will always have coffee on the counter."
3,The good & the bad,"After reading the raves on this coffeemaker we purchased it and we were disappointed. It is a beautiful design and it keeps the coffee hot......but, it was way too messy to fill, although as was suggested there is a pour spout, but even trying to be very careful, it was messy. Also, did not like the way if fills. You have to press down with one hand while holding the cup in the other instead of a McDonalds-like pour. I also did not like having to remove the metal plate to fill my tall cup.Just all around messy. We returned it and purchased a HamiltonBeach brew station which addressed all of those issues. The only thing con is that maybe it is too tall for some cabinets...but, we think we have a winner with the Hamilton."
5,Wonderful!!!,"I have had this coffee maker a few months now. It is wonderful! The machine is very attractive, has lots of neat features and makes great coffee. I highly recommend it!"
1,do not buy,"This is my 2nd and last Cuisinart product. I woke up this morning to the smell of burning plastic and the hotplate on the coffeemaker glowing red. This could have been catastrophic had I not been home. I had the timer set to start and there was about 4 cups of coffee that had brewed before something went terribly wrong. It was very scary to wake up to a smoking coffeemaker.My first Cuisinart lasted about a year before it wouldn't brew anymore. I thought it was a fluke and purchased this one about 6 months ago. I really liked this coffeemaker, but can't risk burning down the house for it.Stay away from this coffeemaker!"
3,Bad Switch,"I am giving this coffee maker 3 stars because it really does make a wonderful cup of coffee. However, after owning this for a little more than 1 year, the switch has gone completely bad, and I am now shopping for a new one. Buyer beware..."
4,Good Coffee Maker,"Overall the unit is well built, it is heavy in comparison to most. The water fill marks are viewable only from the top of the unit making it difficult for a short person to see them although when you can they are easy to read. (Due to it's heigth you must move the unit away from overhead cabinets to fill in any case so a shorter person could use a stool if necessary.) The selectable range heating element keeps the coffee just as you expect. We do not care for the permenant filter as while it does a great job of retaining the grounds, it is difficult to empty without washing the grounds down the drain. It is optional and paper #4 cone filters work just fine."
5,2nd time buyer,My husband and I registered for this coffee maker 13 years ago and I'm happy to say that I just replaced it for the first time since then! Love the taste of the coffee and the quality of the product.
4,very pleased!,"I love my new coffeemaker..I've only experienced one problem and it was my fault---I was in a hurry and didn't place the pot in the coffemaker correctly,it backed up in the filter and coffee spilled everywhere! That is the only !problem I've had, just pay attention and put the pot in correctly---it is a beautiful coffee maker. I would buy this coffeemaker again--it is very attractive and fits on the counter nicely, (small kitchen)"
1,"Don't purchase, a fire hazard.","This is our third one of these, and we have only been in our house for 3 years. My wife called me this morning to tell me that there was smoke coming out of the coffee maker, and then it died. The first one we bought at costco, the second was from amazon, and the third was from Kohl's so it isn't store related. A coffee maker should last more than a year, and certainly shouldn't start on fire. I won't purchase again."
2,Failed after 14 months,"I loved the coffee maker until it completely failed to operate after only 14 months. Prior to that, it made excellent coffee. I cleaned it regularly when the self clean light came on and never had a bad cup of coffee with it. From other reviews that say the same thing, I will avoid buying this one again."
2,Impractical design,"It is too big and clumsy and very difficult to fill as well as difficult to read, both on the canister and the unit. My coffee maker is white. However, it does make good coffee."
1,two died in two years,"We've been through two of these in two years. The first one had a bad switch which couldn't be repaired - which was out of warranty by the time it broke. The second one just died this morning. It started smoking in the back where the cord goes in. It smelled really bad and I think it would have caught fire if we didn't notice. This was also out of warranty when it broke. So I'm out two expensive coffee makers, and will definitely turn to another brand when I buy a new one tonight. :("
1,Poor Carafe Design,"Regarding the Cuisinart DCC 1200 -- Well, I am sorely disappointed in this product. I could not even get the lid off the glass carafe. Terrible design. Two stingy little molded-in plastic tabs about depth of toothpicks where one is supposed to use their fingernails to pry the lid loose. Not made in the United States. I did not even try to make coffee in it, because I refuse to be subjected to tearing my fingers up trying to lift the lid. Bad, bad, design. Somebody fell down on the job. I am hoping they will take it back, refund my purchase price and postage. If they do, I will post a positive on their customer service, but at this piont, I am one unhappy customer."
1,Coffee Maker burned up!,"I owned this unit for about ten months. It made good tasting coffee. However recently after making a pot of coffee I heard loud popping noises and smoke was coming from underneath the warmer. I could smell an odor of burning electronics. I quickly unplugged the unit and placed it outside where it continued to smoke for a few more minutes.After calling Cuisinart they said there were no recalls or reported problems. I would stop using this unit. Another reviewer said, (Don't look back. Buy it!, October 26, 2011) well if you have this coffee maker I sure would look back and not stop. You may find smoke."
4,really good except,If i have one complaint its the lid on the caraffe does not allow for easy use. Otherwise really like all ofthe features.
1,Died after 18 months,"This is an update of my previous review which was very positive. The machine worked well for 18 months, although it was always a hassle to see the time clearly and program the timer. Yesterday I made a pot of coffee and although it brewed the coffee, smoke was coming from the bottom of the machine along with that burning smell we all know so well and indeed the unit had died. I let it cool off and tried to use it again but nothing happened. I tossed it in the trash and frankly will try another brand this time. We've all had Mr. Coffee and Black and Deckers that seem to last forever so I think it is inexcusable for an expensive upscale unit like this to fail after less than 2 years. And it's not like it was overused or abused in any way. I'm the only one using it, typically one pot per day, and it has had new filters and cleaned according to instructions on a regular basis."
4,"Good coffee maker, but needs better switch design","We had this coffee maker for 4 1/2 years, and were very satisfied with how it made coffee and its features.Unfortunately, the toggle switch died, which rendered the machine useless. There was absolutely nothing else wrong with it. We contacted the company, and were told there was really nothing to do for it since the warranty had long expired. We now must trash it.Perhaps a different switch design could make a difference."
3,cup of java,"I find it is hard to measure the amount of coffee you plan on making. The number of cups is built inside the machine and is difficult to see from above. I've made some bitter coffee but I'm still playing with this. Also, the top does not remove as easily as I'd like-I have to pull the entire top off to empty and refill the pot with water instead of the lever action on other pot tops which enables one to open and close with one easy press of the thumb."
5,Nice coffee,"Over three years old now and still brewing strong. Only had to replace caraffe once, because I have a tendency to break caraffes. Found a replacement easy enough through the internet. I found the coffee filters at a few stores however, so didn't have to go through the internet.Amazed price for coffee maker has not changed in three years though."
5,Better than Basic,We have used this coffeemaker for about a month and it makes excellant coffee-very smooth. The water filter probably helps the quality of the taste also. Previously owned the Melitta Grind/Brew but broke twice from weak plastic parts.Worth paying a little extra to get a better product.
2,Interesting Design But Needs Work,"The coffee maker looks nice and incorporates some good features, but has two drawbacks, in my opinion. First, since the opening for the water reservoir is right behind the top of the filter basket you need to be careful not to let the water splash into the coffee filter.Second, the machine is aluminum on the outside with a black plastic liner, and there is no water level indicator on the outside. You are supposed to lean over the machine (hard to do if it is under a cabinet) and look down at the water reservoir and gauge the water level against a grey plastic graduated stick against the black plastic sides. I realize you could just measure the water you pour in to begin with, but that is an extra step if, like me, you use a water filter such as Pur or Brita.In summary, it's a nice machine, but the water reservoir should be separated from the coffee filter, and there should be an external water level indicator."
2,Shouldn't a $150 coffee maker last more than 4 years?,"We received this coffee maker as a wedding present nearly 4 years ago. I registered for it because I thought it looked spiffy. Mistake. After about a year of daily use (just ONCE daily, mind you), the mechanism that delivers water to the grounds started to clog, this even with repeated cleaning. Every few pots or so, we would start the coffee maker and get nothing at all. We would also often get overflowing coffee rather than being able to get a cup mid-brew as advertised. We kept living this way for a while, but now it has stopped altogether. I'm online today looking for a better coffee maker since we are now reduced to boiling water in the kettle and pouring it through the coffee grounds in the coffee maker."
2,Lasted two years,"My coffee maker has been acting rather strange lately, I keep setting it on auto, only to wake up and find it doing a self clean. Not my error either, this has been going on for a week. I am about to chuck it in the bin as I am a coffee freak and hate waking up to crappy coffee which has been going through the self clean cycle for I don't know how long. I thought this coffee maker would last for years since it is a good make and not exactly the cheapest around. Well I am off to research coffee makers, cheers!"
3,Water reservoir a problem.,I purchased the Cuisinart DCC-1200 to replace a Cuisinart Grind and Brew that quit grinding. It's a good machine but has one drawback; the water indicator is inside the water reservoir and hard to read. I have to guess as to how much water I've put into the reservoir.
3,Disappointed,"the bottom line...It makes reasonable coffee and looks good sitting on the counter.Has a few design problems. One, the condensation that builds up on the lid runs down the back of the machine on to the counter the next time you open it. The reservoir is very narrow and it's easy to spill when refilling. Also difficult to see how much water you've addedWould I buy it again, the answer is easy - NO."
1,Dead in under 24 hrs,"We purchased this coffee maker and received it promptly. After brewing the initial hot water to clean the machine, we made one pot of coffee in this unit. It tasted fine -- nothing spectacular here. We unplugged the unit to move it to its permanent home on the counter and when attempting to make coffee the next morning we were surprised to find that the unit wouldn't turn on. We tried everything would could think of, but it was as if the machine had completely died after brewing twice. The clock wouldn't even come on. It was then that I actually noticed all the negative feedback this unit has received. We returned it and are now trying to pick out a non-Cuisinart brand of coffee maker to buy. Pretty disappointing."
2,Where's the water????,"Why in the world would Cuisinart design and/or sell a coffee maker whose water indicator is INSIDE the pot, with no external display of same?? One pours water into a dark cavity in the rear of the pot, then stands on tip-toe to peer down into this deep, dark hole. There is a white gauge on the side of the cavity that is supposed to let you see how much water you have put in. The time it takes to deal with this configuration is absurd! This coffee maker has lots of great features, but how it handles your water and the amount you use is not only ridiculous, but unnecessary!"
3,"Good, but the Carafe is awful","I bought this model because I wanted an adjustable carafe temperature. And the reviews I'd seen were otherwise good. The coffeemaker works really well, as does the temperature control. The problem I have with it is the design of the carafe.The top plastic ring has a lip around the inside of the glass that catches coffee and water when you wash the carafe. No matter how you clean and shake it, unless you completely wipe out the inside of the carafe, including that little lip, there will be retained coffee and/or water.This design is utterly stupid. You simply can't completely empty the carafe by inverting. I think you should be able to wash and rinse the inside and have all the water drain out when you invert it. Not so with this model. The trap there catches and retains fluids, making it not only a nuisance, but potentially dangerous because of retention of moisture and bacteria."
1,Not a good experience,Completely stopped working after a little more than a year - heating element went kaput. Very disappointing.Good performance till then other than the fact it is a pain to pour the water in and there is no external marking to show water level. Going to give the Melitta brand a try next.
1,Never buying this again!!!!,"Worked great at first now 10 months later it is not brewing, called customer service they told me to leave unplugged for an hour the try again (did that still doesn't work) called back again this time she had an attitude (different girl) and told me to decalcify with water and vinegar and let sit for an hour and try it. Okay that didn't work so I called back again and was told by a much nicer gentleman that they will ship new unit but will cost me 10.00 plus I also have to pay to ship my old back. I am doing this because it is cheaper than buying a new maker but this will definitely be my last Cuisinart! Shiny metal and fancy buttons caught my attention I should have stuck to Bunn which I have used for 20 yrs and only had to buy 2 in 20 yrs."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker,"It seems good. I don't know coffee machines, so don't know what I'm missing (if anything). Measure coffee-Measure water-Push brew-Wait. It's simple & easy to use. Makes good coffee, once you've got your coffee/water ratio down."
1,Throwing good money after bad on Cuisinart,"Cuisinart charges $10 to ship out a replacement unit, and then forces you to pay additionally to ship the malfunctioning one back to them. Very bad warranty policy and very poor customer service."
4,Coffe when u need it,"not much to say about this coffee maker accept it delivers instantly, use at the office, makes perfect coffee, easy to clean..would definitively work.."
5,Awesome coffee maker!,"After much research, I chose this coffee maker and am so glad I did! Everything is perfect about this coffee maker and I personally do not find any of the negatives mentioned in other reviews. The water reservoir opening is sufficient, no problems at all pouring water in with the carafe. The coffee tastes great and is very hot, even with the warming plate set on low. The 5 beeps at the end of the brewing cycle are very quiet, not annoying at all. It is very sleek and nice looking on my counter top. The length of the cord is not too short, there is just enough room to pull it out from under my cabinets to fill it. The carafe pours the coffee perfectly, no drips or spills. I would definately reccommend this coffee maker!"
2,BEWARE: PLASTIC COFFEEMAKER!!!,"So, you think this is a deal? Hah! The only metal on this ""brushed metal"" coffeemaker is the band on the carafe and the hot plate it sits on top of! AMAZON is pulling a bait & switch here. Don't be fooled. This item will only look good next to your ""Easy Bake Oven!"""
1,5 month wonder,"It worked great for 5 months. Then, it started sputtering, steaming, and wouldn't make a full 12 cups -- and the soupy stuff eventually produced takes ~40 minutes. I cleaned it (as per spec.: anyhow, it wasn't particularly dirty... and I periodically clean it anyhow). I did its self clean. I ran clear water through it again and again. I recleaned it. It looks 'new' now.But, no good coffee.5-month wonder."
2,Cuisinart DCC-1200 12 Cupper,"Gang:Bought it Coffee is good (of course it depends if u buy good coffee or not)Anyway.... I am ""Luke Warm"" (what a pun!!)about this product... to be candid the liquid is just not warm enough yeah it's almost real hot but not really hot and just cooler as the morning goes on...If you like REALLY HOT COFFEE, dont buy this one"
4,Cuisinart coffee pot,"great cup of coffee. easy to use. water reservoir difficult to read as advised so this was no surprise. Like the toggle switch, carafe and permanent filter. also easy to clean."
1,Broke after 5 months!,This was one of the worst coffee makers I have ever purchased! I miss my Braun! The lid over the basket of grounds would always be full of coffee after brewing and the clock is too little. Difficult to clean and now it won't even brew. What a waste of money.
1,Broke carafe TWICE in 3 months,"While I like this coffeemaker, I only had it for 3 months and now I have to replace it. First I accidentally tapped it against my new granite countertop and while I concede that breakage was entirely my fault, when I poked a hole in the bottom of the glass with a simple steak knife while washing dishes, I GAVE UP!! I am not paying $24.95 for a new glass carafe every few months. Forget it. I am going with the Krups stainless steel model now. I don't know what Cuisinart could do to make a stronger, less breakable carafe, but maybe one option is to make stainless steel available for ALL their models. Sheesh."
1,Poor/Dangerous Quality Appliance,"My Cuisinart stopped working within 1 week and was replaced at store. Within 12 months the power on LED was intermittent where you didn't know if the coffee maker was on or off. At 18 months after starting the coffee maker, I could smell a burning electrical smell filling the house."
1,Poor Quality,"Do not be fooled by the good looks of this machine. We purchased the 12 cup Cuisinart which lasted a couple of years and then it just stopped working one day after producing a horrible burning smell. The smell was so bad, I almost called the fire department because I didn't know the odor was coming from our $100 coffee maker. Cuisinart replaced it under warranty and the replacement unit just stopped working after a year or so. I called Cuisinart and they said that the warranty does not restart from the replacement date, so they will not replace the second faulty unit. Does that make sense? I have replaced the Cuisinart with a Mr Coffee unit, $23 at Tartget. It looks great, makes perfect coffee and I bet that it will last for the next ten years. Do not buy the Cuisinart Coffee Maker, it is junk!"
1,Looks great but.........,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed MetalThis product looked great, matched my other kitchen appliances and isn't Cuisinart a good name? Well this was my second try. My first Cuisinart coffee maker didn't last long. The brew button wouldn't work so I could only get it to go on if I used the programmed button. Then it just stopped working altogether. It got such good reviews I thought I got the only lemmon out there so I purchased another one. It also just stopped working. :( Bummer....I think it's time to try another brand."
3,Not as reliable as I had hoped,"When my Bunn coffeemaker stopped working after about 10 years, I decided to do a little research and settled on this Cuisinart DCC-1200. Thanks to Amazon, I can quickly see that I purchased it on December 29,2009. Today, July 4, 2012 I went to turn on the switch and it didn't turn on. It lasted for 2 1/12 years. I guess I am luckier than some, but I was expecting this to last longer. One other thing that I can see on Amazon is that I paid $64.95. Today it is $87.99 - a 35% increase in price!! I really don't think it is worth it, so it's back to doing more research.I did love the coffee pot, mainly because I could pull out the pot while it was brewing and it would stop the flow of water. It made decent coffee and it looked nice with my stainless appliances."
2,Good-looking but badly flawed,"This coffee maker looks very nice with its retro stainless steel cladding, but unless you're only interested in it as sculpture, think twice. The internal design is extremely poor. The opening to the water reservoir is very narrow, making it hard to fill without spilling. There is no water-level gauge, so you have to measure the water beforehand in the carafe -- which wouldn't be so bad if the reservoir wasn't so spill-prone.Worst of all, the coffee quality is not good. We tried adjusting upward the amount of ground coffee three times and still couldn't match the quality of product coming from our 11-year-old Krups (the equivalent model for which sells today for about $...). The water flows too quickly through the filter, making for a weak brew.Don't believe the hype!"
1,"good coffee, but LEAKS when filling","We have owned this for over a year. If we use the pot to fill the coffee maker it makes a HUGE mess! We thought for this price it wouldn't leak. So long for that idea. But the coffee does taste great. Also we were suppose to get a mail in rebate. My husband mailed, check never came. The rebate was a huge reason we decided to spring for that pot.I consider a leaking pot a BIG problem and that is why I gave only one star."
2,"If the goal is bitter coffee, this one's for you...","This coffee pot looks great and is easy to use. It also makes coffee very quickly which I think may be part of the problem. The resulting coffee is weak and bitter. This product has received great reviews and I wanted it to work but alas, I am back on the hunt for a good coffee maker. I should have stuck with my old Krups."
1,Deserves a minus one star,"We owned this coffee maker previously, it lasted about 7 years. After being so impressed with the quality, we purchased the same maker again. It just died after 1 year. We did a google search on the maker, people have had problems with it catching on fire, the coffee ended up boiling while sitting in the carafe, etc. My husband took it apart and discovered the heating element went bad. I'm thankful it just died and didn't catch my kitchen on fire. Don't waste your money."
2,Great until it stops working,We loved this coffeepot when it worked. Ours stopped keeping time a couple weeks ago. Now it is completely dead. We had it about 1.5 years.
2,CHECK YOUR BOX FOR ALL ITEMS !,I have tried and tried to get the gold basket that was supposed to be included in my box with my coffeemaker. I have the original box and it states right on the box GOLD BASKET INCLUDED. I received a plastic basket that I use paper filters with but I am FED UP trying to get the darn thing from Cuisinart or Amazon. I am VERY disappointed in CUISINART and AMAZON. I have the photos too to prove what the box says. This overpriced coffeemaker and Cuisinart in general have gone downhill in the last 3 years. I'll be looking elsewhere for my kitchen items. SHAME ON YOU CUISINART!
2,read consumer complaints :fire hazard?,"Just bought my DCC 1200 MR metallic red. Nice looking,coffee tastes fair,but does not stay too hot. The clock does not light up. Wish I knew that before I bought it as I must get the flashlight out just to see the time.I just reviewed the Consumer Complaints on line and apparently many of the DCC 1200's have caught fire.Wow; I am surprised at no recall on this item. Cuisinart- you can be sure I will sue you if mine catches fire."
1,Poor Reliability,"I bought this coffee maker in April 2010 based on recommendations found on Amazon and in Consumer Reports.I was disappointed by a couple of minor items such as the difficulty with filling the reservoir without spilling, and reading the clock/timer in its recessed window.Today, February 12, 2011, the unit failed to brew coffee and is now giving off a distinct 'electrical burnt' smell.After reading a number of complaints online involving poor customer service from Cuisinart and many problem reports of a similar nature, including flames & burning plastic, I decided against asking Cuisinart to replace it (aggravated by their stated demand in the 3 year warranty to pay postage both ways).You have been now been warned.Bob K."
5,Great Coffeemaker!,"We have had one of these for the past several years and have been very, very happy with it. My husband was filling it the other day and the carafe cracked... This is our very first problem with it. I just ordered another one so we now have a back-up. I didn't even look to see if we could have bought the carafe alone (kinda silly not to) but I'm still very happy with the whole thing. I would highly recommend it."
4,"Does everything a coffee pot should do, and looks good too.","The controls are easy use, the coffee tastes fine, the hot plate keeps the coffee at a temp of your choosing, and thank goodness...when you poor a cup of coffee it doesn't spill all over the counter. And it's one of the few nice looking mid size coffee pots available (for what I consider a decent price) that doesn't look and feel cheap. I only have two very minor complaints. My first issue is the same one I have with all Coffee-mate coffee pots...those darn cone filters. What is wrong with the much cheaper standard round coffee filters, do they get a kick back from Malita? The second thing is the clock...it's not back-lit, which makes it hard to read in low light. Both are very minor issues (I know the cone filters is a pet peeve of mine that will not be an issue for most) that detract only slightly from an excellent coffee maker. I would recommend it to anyone who asked."
2,Too Tall!!!,"If you have the open counter or island this product might be just perfect for you. We have always kept our coffee maker against the wall below the kitchen cabinets. This configuration DOES NOT WORK for this tall machine. In order to make coffee, you must slide it out from under the cabinets to give enough room to swing the top open. In order to slide it out you must UNPLUG the extremely short power cord. It does make coffee but isn't worth the hassle when there are so many better designed products on the market."
1,Seriously flawed product,"I agree with Joan and others that this product is seriously flawed. Initially, it makes great coffee, although the unit is a bit too tall, and because of the placement of the tank and small opening, it is very east to spill water when filling the tank. I could live with these design flaws. The real problem is that after a few months, the unit stops working, as many others have reported. Instead of hot water flowing from the water reservoir to the showerhead, the water all boils off. Only condensed water from the cover makes it into the filter basket. I get maybe one cup of awful coffee. The ""self clean"" light comes on, but the cleaning lasts one time at most. I have used the self-clean function repeatedly, to no avail. Stay away from this coffee maker. I am back to using an old Braun coffee maker, which unfortunately Black & Decker, which owns Braun, no longer makes."
1,great when new,"This coffee maker is great when it's new... the coffee brews quickly and is piping hot when the beep sounds. But after a few months, it goes from hot to warm and you have to put your cup in the microwave to get it as hot as it was. But my major gripe is its lifespan... I've owned two of these in the last four years, with each lasting two years. Well I wasn't about to buy a third, so I went digging in the basement for my old Corning Ware perculator. To my pleasant surprise, it's still working after 42 years as opposed to this 2 year Cuisinart. By the way, the good old fashioned perked coffee has a rich scrumptious flavor that I don't think a coffee maker can match."
1,no power,This product worked fine for @ 2 years but one morning it just wouldn't turn on. I called Cuisinart because there was supposed to be a 3 year warranty but according to them my model had been produced prior to the three years so I'm out of luck. I know its been three years because we got it as a wedding gift and we haven't reached our 3rd anniversary yet.
1,The 'mayfly' of coffee makers,"Lovely in a quirky kind of way, but very short lived.I didn't have one of these, I had 3-- I'm that much of a sucker for the vaguely retro, vaguely diner styling: it was perfect for my kitchen.The best lasted about 8 months, the other 2 less than that.2 simply stopped working, the other developed a leak.Replaced it with a Bunn, which has been flawless for over 4 years-- and it's almost as nice to look at."
4,Pretty Nice Coffee Maker,"It's a pretty nice coffee maker. Makes great tasting coffee, and the filter in it works really well. The water filter keeps the coffee tasting really good.Only complaint is that the device doesn't have a quality look (pretty ""cheesy"" plastic front/side). But I guess a lot of products are like that anymore. Hard to find a quality product that will last for years, but not real complaints for this yet. We've had it for about 3 months now, and its still working well."
5,Excellent for coffee lovers !,"Coffee-maker met all my expectations ! Brews delicious coffee, easy to operate & clean. So nice NOT to have water dribbeling from the pour-spout."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200MR Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker,"Coffee pot leaks when pouring. Always have to wipe up after. Otherwise, mechanically, the coffee maker works. I like the red metallic color--a cheerful addition to the kitchen decor."
5,Great Product,"Cuisinart is, by far, the best coffee maker brand I've used. The Red 1200MR is a beautiful addition to my kitchen."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this coffee maker after reading these reviews and although it does make a fairly good cup of coffee, I spend more time cleaning the counter from the water that leaks from under the handle from heat condensation and from condensation on the lid after each pot. When you open the lid it's supposed to drip the condensated water back into the holding tank but it seems to bypass the appropriate hole and runs straight down the back of the coffeemaker all over the place.I gave this 3 stars because it makes a great cup of coffee, but it lacks in design of some flaws it has. ..."
4,"Makes Great Coffee, lousy users manual and customer support","Overall, I have mixed feelings about this coffee maker...Some positives and some negatives.On the positive side is that the coffee maker does make a better and consistent cup of coffee. This Coffee Maker replaced a $20.00 Hamilton Beach unit and you can taste the difference between a cup of coffee made with the Cuisinart and one made with the Hamilton Beach.However, on the negative side, the user manual is atrocious as far as explaining how to remove items for cleaning, how to operate, etc.. Usually, small appliance users manuals stink but this one took the prize. It is the worst. Also, their customer support is nonexistent. I sent a note asking a question about whether you needed to use the paper filters that came with the unit in addition to the Gold Tone filter. Still waiting for a reply. The answer is no, you don't need to use the paper filter."
2,Great until it breaks,"This coffeemaker was great, and looked great. Then when three years hit (and the 3 year warranty was up!) the machine just stopped working! They couldn't do anything for us, that didnt' cost as much as a new machine. Very frustrating, I would not buy this brand again! I don't reccomend it!"
1,Complete failure in less than 16 months,"How long should a coffee maker last? In my opinion, at least 4-5 years. I purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1200 in Nov. 2010 and it completely failed after less than 16 months of regular, daily use. Therefore, I cannot recommend the DCC-1200. However, after calling Cuisinart customer service, they have agreed to replace it for free. I hope the new one lasts longer than the first one."
1,"Poorly designed product, don't waste your money!","This coffee maker looks great, very attractive but poorly designed. Our first cups of coffee were so weak I looked at the design of the water spout, and discovered that there were 6 or 8 small holes in a very small circle that dripped water only on the middle of the coffee grounds. Most of the grounds stayed dry, resulting in very weak coffee. Next, the carafe lid opens backwards! You heard that right, backwards! Then, I discovered water leaking from somewhere under the product. Also, don't expect to be able to see the reservior water level from outside, you must lift the lid for this simple task! Don't waste your money on ""good looks"" as that is all this product has going for it! I returned it and bought a Black and Decker for 1/2 the price which is well designed and works great!"
4,Its a good machine,Good coffee maker - still gotta use really good whole beans to get a great cup of coffee. Very good value.
2,Cool design. Cold coffee.,"Fantastic design. Great looks. Neat features.Ice-cold coffee.Anytime you can pour a cup and drink it right away it's too cold. That's the unfortunate case with this machine. I've been using it for about a week and I'm so disappointed.If you don't mind microwaving your coffee after you make it, buy this machine. I, for one, am returning mine today."
1,Cuisinart DCC-1200,"Looked good, worked OK for a week or so, then went completely dead. Went out and got a Black and Decker, which does fine."
1,Don't trust the warranty!,"We do drink a lot of coffee, so we bought this machine about 1 1/2 years ago. It worked for about a year other than the carafe leaking and the top not closing all the way, it did make good coffee. It finally quit working and we hadn't saved any of the information, so we just bit the bullett and bought another ""new"" model. Again it worked well for about 6 months. Suddenly it completely stopped working. Called Cuisinart and asked about the warranty (we saved all the info this time) and first they made us jump thru all kinds of hoops resetting, cleaning, doing all kinds of stuff to the unit. When none of it worked, they told us we would have to give them our credit card # and we would be responsible for shipping the unit to them and thay would charge is us for the shipping back to us, and this would probably take a month or so. We told them what to do with their coffee maker and went and got a better machine."
1,Coffee pot caught on fire,We had this coffee pot for 8 months and one Sunday morning the warmer caught on fire. Luckily we were home and able to put the fire out. We will never buy another Cuisinart.
1,Not brushed metal--VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!,I bought a Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffee maker about 7 years ago that just recently stopped working. I ordered this new one from Amazon and the metal looks completely different. I think it is painted silver--the new one has a completely different look than the one I had purchased 7 years ago.
3,Adequate choice,"This coffeemaker was a replacement for a Braun coffeemaker that was about ten years old and unfortunately is no longer being sold here. The Cuisinart was highly rated but seems unduly complicated to just make coffee every morning. It is difficult to see how much water you have put in if you are only making six cups or less. You must be very careful to push the empty pot fully into the coffeemaker or you will get coffee coming out of the brewing chamber. It is described as being stainless steel, but the only steel is a thin band around the lower part of the pot and the body of the machine is stainless-colored plastic. If you use the ""gold"" filter included instead of a paper filter, you will end up with fine coffee sediment in the pot and your cup. I will be interested in seeing how long this machine lasts; I have a feeling it won't come anywhere close to lasting as long as my Braun."
4,Quality product,"Surprise! I ordered free shipping and this product arrived within 2 days at the height of the Christmas season. A tip of the hat to Amazon.com. This brewer is definitely a quality product and I am comfortable with what I paid for it. My first brew was stale, ground decaf, so I have yet to judge the quality from ground Starbucks, however, I can say it is definitely HOT. Do not believe anyone who says the coffee from this brewer is luke warm. It has all the features to produce a superb cup of coffee all the way down to the charcoal filter and high quality gold tone filter, especially for smaller measures (4 cups and less). I am satisfied withthis purchase. The one drawback is no outside water level indicator. It is on the inside but water poured from the pot is the true measure anyway."
5,Terrific coffeemaker,"Purchased this to replace more expensive coffeemaker and have been delighted from day 1. It has compact footprint on the counter, clean design. The coffee brews quickly and is much hotter than previous coffeemaker. I'd recommend this machine and consider its price a bargain for a product I use daily. The programmable auto-off is helpful feature."
3,Good but stopped workiing,"Makes great coffee, easy to clean, (near) dripless carafe but stopped pumping water up to the coffee basket after 4 years of use :( If it lasted 2-3 more years, I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars."
4,Coffee Lover Likes it,"I really enjoy this coffee maker. Only two things that I would change but I can live with.Number 1: The opening where you pour the water in the maker is a little small. I would have made the opening larger.Number 2: The maker is a little tall and I cannot open the cabinet door above where the coffee maker is setting on counter. But this is good also, because then the maker will not be pushed under the above cabinets and turned on allowing the steam to damage the above cabinet.I like the timer feature. I like the beep sounding when coffee brewing is complete. I really like the auto shut off. I do think the water filter improves the coffee flavor. I purchased this coffee maker to replace a kitchen aid coffee maker that was old and just quit."
4,No Light but Hot Coffee,"Nice program for having a morning cup of coffee already made. The 1-4 cup features brews extra hot co9ffee. The warming plate has light to high setting but not sure how hot the plate gets (Who wants burned tasting coffee?) I do not know why this model was made with a digital clock with no light??? Makes it hard to see the time. My cheap 10.00 pot had a light that I enjoyed especially upon waking up in the middle of the night and heading down to the kitchen for a snack. The coffee filter holder has to be physically ""pushed"" down into place for the pause/brew to work.(Annoying) Everything is plastic including the knobs which are small. Overall the coffee has been hot and tasting good for its first day of use."
3,Purchased from Amazon 9/27/10 and needed to be replaced,"Although I can't fault the customer service Amazon, as usual, was very professional and extremely helpful in assisting me by sending me a new one .How good is it really? if this coffeemaker should fail so soon after being purchased on (9/27) I called Cuisinart and they diagnosed it as a water pump failure (happened on 12/6) and required this be returned first to their service facility in Arizona before they would replace it and gave me a time frame of 2 to 3 weeks.Unbeknownst to me,the very polite Cuisinart customer service representative sent another one right out , I was not expecting it at all and I was very surprised ""Three stars because It does look beautiful and it brews really well (except for the water reservoir which as most people have noted is tricky to impossible to see while filling.) Consumer Reports determined that yes this brews really good coffee, But all of the positives aside, it should not fail in light to moderate use."
4,Overall a solid performer with great looks...,"Great styling. Have had it for approx 2weeks and everyone is pleased with looks and performance. We found that coffee for first 1/2 hour is very hot (we all drink it up and go to work so longer than that not necessary). If you want boiling hot then you should invest in a percolator, but you might not get much flavor then. The carafe pours really well and coffee drips perfectly into it without any spills.The only negatives is that the hole for water reservoir is small and difficult to pour into with arthritic hands. Also would like to see larger clock display or maybe backlit, because it is a bit small. You can purchase all these features for $20-30 less, but not the looks and we wanted something to match our kitchen appliances. Overall a solid performer with great looks."
1,LEAKY MESS,"My husband bought this coffee pot after I suffered some burns using a French press coffee pot early in the morning before I was fully awake. I have two complaints about this coffee pot: 1)it leaks all over the counter and 2) it doesn't make 12 cups of coffee at the strength I prefer because if I load enough coffee into basket to get the taste we like, it backs up into the water reserve.I will give it one star because I do like the taste of the coffee I get using the maximum amount of coffee with eight cups of water."
4,nice product,"They need to work on the carafe cover/top design. I'm guessing it's not going to last long with how it snaps in place. Otherwise, it's a very nice product and makes a perfect cup of coffee."
4,Makes great coffee.,"Very nice coffee pot, but when pouring the water in the reservoir, if you poor too fast the water runs back up the pot and all over the counter. I have some trouble getting the lid to fit back on. Would prefer a hinged lid. The little sensor button in the bottom of the warming plate makes it hard to set the pot in straight. Overall it is a good solid unit with a stylish look and takes up less counter space the many of the others I looked at. Makes a very good cup of coffee."
2,Quality control problems,"We had one of these for about a year and a half. Then it went bad. It would not stay on. At times, it would turn off every few seconds after the switch was pushed to ""on."" It did make decent coffee so we decided to get another. We have had it for about 2 weeks, but it only worked correctly the first 3-4 times we used it. Then it started making terrible gurggling noises for about 10 minutes near the end of every brew cycle. Now, the self-clean light comes on every few times it is used, indicating it is full of calcium deposits. However, we have very soft water, and the previous unit never required cleaning because of deposits. Meanwhile, we put up with the gurgling so we can have our morning coffee. Other than that, the coffee tastes fine."
1,Like the coffee pot hate the carafe,"I've owned Bunn coffee makers for over 20 years. I like them and the three minute coffee they produced. I felt I was ready for change, and I like my new Cuisinart coffee maker. I can live with the 12-15 minutes it takes to create a new pot of coffee. 20 plus years, I never broke a Bunn carafe. Now, 2 1/2 months after buying my new coffee maker, I'm buying a new carafe. I couldn't tell you how it cracked, but it's cracked and costs a little less than 1/3 the price of the entire coffee pot. It's very thin glass, and I'm at a loss. One more carafe and I'm back to a Bunn boy."
4,Not Metal Case as Advertised,"I like the coffeepot workings itself. However, I had opted for this model because the body was advertised, setting itself apart from other models, as being ""brushed metal"". It is nothing of the kind. It is plastic. That was a disappointment."
5,This coffee maker makes a great tasting coffee,This coffee maker makes a great tasting coffee. I was very please to find a coffee make that make a great tasting coffee.I did not expect that from the same coffer grounds that one coffee maker could be so much better that an other coffee maker. This coffee maker really does make a much better cup of coffee.
2,3 Months - defective,"This is a beautiful coffee maker and when first used, loved it. Now, three months in, it is defective even after a couple of cleanings (not brewing properly - incomplete cycles). Could be clogged? The grounds do stick to the top lid and when not very carefully wiped off will fall into the water basin. It does come with a 3 year warranty for ""household only"" use only (as specified with customer service). Customer service is a bit of hassle, they will tell you it is defective due to the calcium buildup and will want to know specifically how you interpret their cleaning instructions written in the their manual and what your water source is. They are not too helpful with you in getting these serviced/returned. This coffee maker is not worth the hassle. There are other brands that are more reliable and cost less. Don't waste your time and money with this one.On a positive note, the coffee pot is better than most at pouring."
4,Price & Consumer Reports led me to this coffee maker,"This coffee maker was rated first in Consumer Reports. Don't know what year. At $71 with a $10 rebate & a 3yr. warranty, it was worth it. Coffee does not have any bitter taste & stays hot. I would agree with another review about the water reservoir being difficult to read. I rely on the carafe measurements. Would be nice if the clock was lighted making it easier to see from across the kitchen, but my main goal was great tasting coffee & I got it."
2,Unfortunately the greatness is short-lived,"We've had one of these for just over two years. We loved it, unfortunately two years seems to be the limit of its life. The switch has gone out on ours and it no longer turns on reliably, and turns itself off at random intervals. We are going to have to replace it.We have complained to Cuisinart and gotten no response of any kind.Just an FYI that the machine is not going to last all that long. If you are okay with getting a new one every couple of years, then this one is great. If you want your applicances to last longer, or if you want the company to stand behind its product, then maybe not so much."
2,Not the best construction,Top of reservoir came loose after 6 weeks use. Water from carafe overflows spout no matter how carefully it is poured. Other than this the coffe is well brewed.
4,Best one yet,I purchased mine in Feb this yr. already had to get an exchange. That didn't bug me that much. Only because things can fail anytime. I do like all the features it has. Temp setting is nice. Just as a warning. If anyone has to get theirs replaced through the manufacturer (Conair) and your still under warranty. Please advise them to make sure it's a new product and not refurbished. By accident according to Conair they sent me a refurbished coffee maker. I was very unhappy. Kept it only because I didn't want to wait another 2wks.
2,Awkward to fill & remove grounds,"Don't buy this coffeemaker if you have a cabinet above the location where you put the coffeemaker. It is too tall to remove the grounds basket,or for that matter fill both coffee & water. You have to pull the appliance out of it's location to do both operations. Doesn't sound like much, but after awhile it gets to be a pain. Makes good coffee, but definetly has design problems."
2,Basket overflow,"I had one of these for five years and had no problems; made great coffee with no mess. I just replaced it and am now on my third one in three weeks due to overflow from the basket. I put only half of the max. amount of grounds in and am still having the grounds back up to the top of the paper filter and into the spray mechanism. Have tried everything Cuisinart recommends: Different filters, different grind of coffee, different carafe placement, charcoal filter in, charcoal filter out, etc. No luck so far---never had this problem with my old one (exact same model). Otherwise love the coffeemaker, but am about to give up and just return it for another brand. Has anyone solved this?"
4,Nice coffee maker,"Makes great coffee and keeps it very hot. The only thing I don't like is that the numbers for the water line are on the inside of the coffee maker, not on the outside, so it can be difficult to see the water line from the inside. Otherwise it's very nice."
5,Best cup of coffee I have EVER had!,"From the first cup, I was in love with this coffeemaker! Maybe it is the charcoal filter, I don't know, but SOMETHING makes the coffee tast much better from this unit.Although I thought I would never use the auto-brew feature, we have used it several times; it is GREAT to wake up to the smell of fresh coffee!The charcoal filters are high, but shopping Amazon cut the price in half -"
4,Wonderful product,"This coffeemaker is very attractive and produces a flavorful, excellent pot of coffee. It has all the necessary bells and whistles (delayed brew, coffee-ready signal, auto shut-off). The only unfavorable comment I have is that pouring the water into the coffeemaker is unnecessarily awkward. I'd love to see an outside indicator for water and an easier-to-use (perhaps larger) water well. Otherwise, this is a great product."
4,NICE!,"Finally a coffee maker that is easy to program! Even a caveman can do it! It's a handsome appliance and looks great on our new granite, makes delicious coffee, and is fairly quiet compared to some of the other ones that gurgle and hiss. My only complaint is that the LCD time is very small and its a little hard to read. You will need another clock in the room, but the coffee maker is worth it. Great value for the price too."
5,Consumer Reports is right,"Did research on a new coffeemaker and found that Consumer Reports recommended the Cuisinart DCC-1200. Found a good price at Amazon enhanced by a rebate to seal the deal. Like the straightforward progamming, the charcoal filter and right hand fill for the water. It came with a gold filter, but I continue to use paper filters because they make it easier to trash the grounds. The bottom line is that the machine makes good coffee and I'm happy with it."
4,"Good coffee, few design flaws","We bought the all-black model DCC-1200. It makes great coffee, but there are a few design flaws that are irritating. First, it's LCD clock is almost impossible to read. The black coffeemaker, with a black rim around the clock, makes reading the time very difficult, without a backlight, which should have been included in the design. Likewise, the all black, inside and out, makes it difficult to know when you have poured the correct quantity of water into the reservoir. Unless you have a light source directly above the coffeemaker, you cannot see at what level you have poured the water. Finally, the position of the water reservoir, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is in the back, and is small and awkward to use. None of these things were a problem in our all-white, inexpensive Mr. Coffee."
1,Buy Mr. Coffee LMX27 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker instead,"At first we loved this coffee maker. It is probably the most popular model since it seems everyone has one. The reason I hate it is because you cannot adjust the brew strength and it brewed our coffee extremely weak. We had to change from a medium roast to a dark roast just to get any coffee flavor. It was ridiculous. Buy the Mr. Coffee LMX27 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker instead. Not only is it much cheaper but it is less bulky, you can adjust the brew strength, and it is less expensive. The only thing I don't like is that the clock is not digital but it isn't an issue once you get used to it. Who tells time by their coffee maker anyway?"
2,"Warning-this is plastic, not metal","We ordered this as a replacement for a beloved 10 year old version of the same coffee maker, which finally died. As we unpacked it, we were disappointed to find that the ""brushed metal"" exterior was actually silver colored plastic (except for the back which is black plastic). Looks cheap even from a distance. This seems to be the same model as the stainless steel version. Went to Macy's which had a stainless steel one on display, but the plastic versions were inside all the boxes there too. Makes me suspect that this was a recent price cutting switch to this model which isn't yet reflected in the descriptions. For the price, you can get a coffee maker that works as well and looks a lot better. We're returning it."
4,"My fourth one! Great coffee, short life","I just bought my fourth Cuisinart DCC-1200. Two previously for myself and one for my parents. I have had other pots including Mr. Coffee but nothing compares to Cuisinart. The first had a small leak problem almost immediately but I attributed that to the rough handling it received in the unpacking process. Eventually the leak grew and it was necessary to replace. The second Cuisinart lasted about 19 months and then just stopped working. My parents' is still working but they have only had for 18 months. The coffee maker seems to have an 18-20 month life span. I thought is was just me, until I read the other reviews and everyone seemed to have the same issue. So this time I bought it at Best Buy for about the same price and purchased their two year replacement plan for $14.95. So if this one follows the pattern, I will be able to replace it for free."
5,Excellent machine!,"Previously had Grind and Brew - which I was happy with, but not thrilled. Found this coffee maker to provide better coffee, and HOT coffee! Yay!"
4,Only flaw: The BEEP,"Only one complaint: The 5 beeps at the end are so high-pitched. I am the type of caffeine-addict who wakes up with a headache & it doesn't go away until I've had coffee. So, I come to the kitchen, hit the button to start coffee, and then usually hang out for a few (unload the dishwasher, whatever). When the coffee is done, if you are in the same room, it is such an unpleasant noise. That's the ONLY thing that I don't like about this coffeemaker.Go ahead & buy it, though! I'll figure out a way to muffle the speakers or something. :)"
3,Programmable clock broke within a year and a half,"Although the unit looks good and functions pretty well, the programmable clock broke within a year and a half. Thankfully I had saved the warranty info, and the company claims that they will fix the unit if I send it in to them. It's a bit inconvenient, either way. But I gave it 3 stars because it's worked well other than that."
3,coffee pot,I was not happy with my purchase. I used this product while on vacation and thought it was great?? I don't know why it doesn't taste like fresh brewed coffee? It's just ok.
2,Great coffee for a year until it self-immolated,"I got this coffeemaker March 2011, and it made fine coffee which is the reason it gets two stars instead of one. Until today my only complaint was that water drips down the back when the top is opened to clean it out.This morning during the brew cycle, it started to make popping sounds, stink of an electrical fire, and appeared to have shut off although it continued making noises. I unplugged it, dumped the coffee and got out the french press for my morning joe. Fortunately I was in the kitchen making breakfast when this happened. After returning from work I plugged it back in, and the clock displays and the light comes on when the switch flipped to On, but it no longer brews. Water just sits in the reservoir. I purchased it here on Amazon and read the reviews, but was skeptical about the complaints regarding this issue and bought it anyway. Now I've learned the hard way that there's really something to it."
2,Timer Quit working,I used this coffee maker less than thirty days and the timer QUIT WORKING.I guess I will go back to using my Mr. Coffeemaker.I have used them for over 30 years and Never had a problem.IF I COULD DETERMINE HOW TO CONTACT amoazon.com I WOULD.I guess I will go back to shopping local..
2,Don't leave house with it turned on!,"Bought Oct 2012. Worked fine until June 22, 2012 when it almost burned the house down! Good thing someone was home! The burner was cherry red and smoke was pouring out of the back. I have to add that I contacted cuisinart directly and they replaced the coffeemaker free of charge! Great customer service-I was impressed!"
1,Bad Product Design,"Faulty Design!If the pot isn't seated just right in the machine, and you brew, you'll get coffee and grounds all over the kitchen and throughout the brewing area and in the coffee pot. It's very easy to put the pot in the machine wrong. I returned a previous pot like this, but kept this one too long to return it. I'm throwing it away."
1,only lasted 1 year,"this model lasted only ONE year. i was happy with it when it worked, but when you pay this much for a coffee maker, you would expect it to last longer than a year, so for that reason i am only going to give this item ONE star. I would give it no stars if i could. i am extremely disappointed that I am going to have to spend even more money for a coffee maker AGAIN, trust me, it won't be a cuisinart."
2,poor durability,"We loved this coffee maker, but it lasted only about 9 months. Other customers have had similar experiences, so I would not recommend it."
1,"DO NOT BUY! Two died on us, and we're not the only ones","Two of these coffee makers have suddenly stopped working within 18 months. You'll find other reviews with the same issue. Do not buy! I would have given it 0 starts, but that isn't an option.Is this planned obsolescence so that we go out and buy another one? Shame on you, Cuisinart. I'm going back to my good 'ol french press."
1,the WORST machine EVER,"This coffee maker is more like a 'coffee waster.' It is NEVER consistent. It brews too quickly to utilize all of the grounds. (a great deal of the coffee grounds never even get used in the brewing process) Miraculously, if you add 10 cups of water, you will only get 8 cups of coffee. (same for smaller brewing amounts) If the grounds are even slightly close to the top, like an inch, they will be forced over the sides into the water reservoir, which means inevitable clogging and premature maintenance. The only reason this machine is getting one star is because i've no other choice, and some coffee is better than none, even it means consistent frustration with such a terrible piece of equipment."
1,!!!!FIRE HAZARD!!!!!,ALERT! Please read Consumer Affairs on Cuisinart 1200 and all of the other Cuisinart coffee makers. Mine started burning up only after 6 months of use! Hundreds of other people have had the same issue. Cuisinart is knowledgable of this malfunction of the electric warming plate but has not done a recall. If I had not been home when the warming plate decided to go postal my house would have burned down. Just do a search on Consumer Affairs (Cuisinart coffeemaker fire) and you will see hundreds of complaints. Or click this link: [....] Sorry to bust your bubble! Sheila
3,check out the one star reviews,"This makes great coffee, but it didn't even last a year; just stopped working one day. The company will replace,and will want to charge a shipping fee for the replacement."
3,We loved it... but then it died.,"We've been using this for about 1 year, and have loved it. Works great, but today the burner died on us. So, it will brew.... but won't keep our coffee hot! Bummer."
4,Cuisinart Coffee Pot,It has been very dependable so far. It takes a bit of getting used to the beeping warnings that let you know when it is starting to brew/done brewing. The clock needs to be backlit and then it would be close to perfect.
3,Not what I hoped for,We were given this as a house warming gift and for the most part it works great but after only a few months it's already leaking and the side part that measures the water is stuck.It's doing ok though but I wish I'd gotten a more reliable one.
1,Poor Design.,"not a lot to like here. as others have pointed out, there's no level indicator, it's hard to even pour the water into the crevice provided. But the worst part is the carafe is too large for the hopper. if you follow the included instructions you can only brew 7.5 cups of good coffee. Even our 10-cup Krups had a larger hopper that wouldn't overflow. But this thing takes up more space has a larger carafe but makes less coffee? And yes, you open the lid and the condensation covers your counter.All of these seem bad this one very poorly designed, i researched these, and still i hate the shortcomeings of this one. Thought I could live with them, but this is just poor design, and i want to smash it everday. so look for better. This looks great great but is poorly designed, even the filter barely fits in the basket. AVOID. i may just return this."
2,Coffeemaker,"eThe water level is on the inside of the pot, therefore making it hard to read the amount of water needed to make coffee. I wish I could return the coffee pot for a refund."
5,It's awesome and red,"I've had this coffee maker only about a month but so far it is great. First of all, it's red, which is very cool. Second, the carafe has a specially-designed nice wide pouring spout so you don't spill coffee all over the place when you are trying to fill your cup FAST which is what needs to happen in the mornings at our house. It also makes it easier to fill the water chamber. The permanent gold filter is excellent -- no coffee filters escaping the box and spilling all over the cupboard, and the charcoal filter also seems to improve the taste. Finally, it's got a nice streamlined design and takes up less counter space than my other coffee maker. Two well-caffeinated thumbs up for this one."
3,It works,"I find nothing special or terrible about this product. I think it does what it is supposed to do. My only small complaint is that you have to pour the water into a small target. With limited counterspace it is difficult if you have low hanging cabinets and don't extend the top all the way back. With ours being next to the sink, we just use the sprayer to fill it up instead of pouring out of the pot. Other than that it is just fine. The coffee brews just fine."
3,"Decent coffee maker, but","Got this coffee maker a month ago...good first impressions and overall look, except:1) tall machine, so must be careful adding water (right side only)2) top cover lid drips water down the outside back of the machine if cover lifted all the way up after brewing3) water reservoir is very dark (no outside viewing of water level), so must have good light above to be able to see see the water level and stepped indicator."
1,Cuisinart Brew Central DCC-1200 Coffee Maker - FIRE HAZARD,"I bought the Cuisinart Brew Central DCC-1200 12 Cups Coffee Maker November 14, 2010 from Amazon for $65.25. I have used it approximately 5 times/week since that time. Yesterday, during the brewing process, I heard unusual sounds (gurgling, cracking, hissing) coming from the machine. When I checked it, I found smoke coming from the hot plate. I lifted the carafe (the coffee was actually boiling) and found the front half of the hot plate bright red. I immediately unplugged the unit, while smoke began to pour out from the hot plate and there was a stong burning plastic smell. I called Cuisinart for a refund. They refused and wanted to send me a replacement. Obviously, I was not interested. This would have led to kitchen fire if I had not been in the kitchen at this time. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER! From research on the internet, this is becoming a common complaint about this product and Cuisinart is not standing behind this product."
4,Great coffee!,Makes great coffee. Pouring water in the reservoir is a bit clumsy as the opening is a bit small. Additionally the height forces me to pull the unit out from under the cabinet quite far to pour the water. Otherwise very happy.
5,cuisinant dcc-1200,"very good coffee maker so far. everything that is avertised that i need works well. no drips to cleanup like my old hamilton beach. brews coffee fast enough for me. do'nt need timer so have not used but understand from friends that it works well. the only conplaint which is minor because i think all coffee makers have this problem is the placement of the place where water is poured into coffee maker. should carry red one.Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Brushed Metal"
5,Glad I invested in this coffee maker,I just replaced a Krups that was probably 25-30 years old. I read the reviews in Consumer Reports & they were right! I use this to heat up water for my hot cocoa & it's perfect! My husband is excited to try it for his morning coffee:)
1,"Grounds destroy it, don't buy this one","Bad bad bad. If grounds spill into the water reservoir, they will clog up and break this coffee maker. It can't be repaired.It's remarkably easy for you to break this coffee maker:* Put in the carafe slightly off center (easy to do), then coffee doesn't brew into the carafe, but instead fills up the filter and grounds overflow into the reservoir: Broken coffee maker.* Put in the filter slightly off center (easy to do), then coffee fills up and grounds overflow into reservoir: Broken coffee maker.* Set on the carafe's lid without completely snapping it into place (easy to do), then coffee fills up and grounds overflow into the reservoir: Broken coffee maker.This is my second of the same coffee maker that was destroyed by coffee grounds.Terrible engineering and terrible product. Buy something else but cheap and usable."
4,Excellent Coffee,"Makes excellent coffee. The ""beep"" when coffee is done is hard to hear if you have trouble with high pitched sounds. When cleaning the machine to put it away and lifting the lid where the coffee grounds are, there is a lot of moisture/water that runs down and is a little messy. It does, however, make very good coffee even though the design isn't quite as good as it should be for the price."
2,Weak coffee,Machine looked great; operation easy; but bad coffee-super weak. So had to return it with a $20 mailing cost I had to eat.
4,Great Machine but......,"The design is great. Looks good in most locations (even to people who hate gadgets) and technically, extremely well engineered. It makes very hot coffee and this is the where the but... starts. If the water is too hot, freshly ground coffee becomes bitter and changes flavour. The instruction manual is very good on how to correctly grind coffee, keep coffee beans (to freeze or not to freeze that is the quesiton) but, the desire to produce a really hot cup of coffee makes this all a little suprfluous. If you want scalding coffee and flavour is secondary, you will love this machine. If you savour coffee flavour, then maybe another machine is better for you (and you should definitely not use the ""less than 4 cups"" option)"
1,Lasted 13 months and quit working,"This is not an inexpensive coffee maker, but it is cheap. I bought it in August 2011, and it died in October 2012."
3,Short Life Span-Check The Warranty,"Worked great for 2 years, then it quit. No heat, no brew. There was a 3 year warranty, but it costs $20.00 in shipping, paid by the customer, to get it fixed at Cuisinart's facility. For $24.95 I bought a new Proctor Silex coffee maker. Understand all of the terms of a warranty BEFORE you buy any product. Go to the company's website and check. See if the warranty actually reflects no-cost to the customer. I will from now on."
4,Good coffee maker,"Easy to program,coffee has a good flavor,easy clean up ,a very good coffee maker at a reasonable price nice appearance"
1,terrible coffee,"I bought this coffee maker even though I had read a lot about how it just did not make good coffee. I bought it to match some stainless that I had and because the pot itself did not feel flimsy. BUT!!! No matter what you do (add extra coffee, buy a more expensive brand, try an espresso grind) there is NOTHING you can do to improve the flavour. Another reviewer had stated that she thought that it was the pattern of the water as it flows over the coffee and I think she must be right. So if you like your brew tasting watery all the time, and you don't appreciate a rich full-bodies cup of java, then this Cuisinart is the brand for you."
4,Nice coffee maker,"I like this coffee maker. It makes good coffee, is easy to program and clean, and I like the retro design."
1,Didn't Work Out As Expected,"When this coffee maker works, it makes a very good cup of coffee and has some great features ... However, I had this new unit in storage over a year, as it was a gift to me, but I had a coffee maker and didn't need it just then. When I did pull it out and use it, it was great ... but quit working after 6 weeks of use. I used the cleaning feature over and over thinking that might be the problem, but no. As much as this unit costs, I expected a lot more than 6 weeks of use. Perhaps I should stick to the $30 units that last for years."
5,Best Value for exceptional quality auto drip coffee maker,"I am very pleased with this coffee maker, it is solidly built and performs even better than expected. Great coffee convenient use."
2,misled by reviews,"Highly overrated coffee maker. Not sure why the enthusiasm in other on-line reviews. Basic low level frustrations: awkward design, excessive bulk, cold coffee, too many pieces. Then I went on vacation and used a twenty dollar coffee maker. Far superior. Don't pay up for this example of marketing over design."
1,Coffee pot fire,I first purchased this coffee maker in 2010. It was wonderful and made great coffee. Then in July it started smoking and burned on my counter. Good thing I was home and grabbed the pot to take it outside.I contacted Cuisinart and they replaced the pot - great customer service. Now six months later the pot has just stopped working and will not turn on. I am replacing this coffee maker with another brand.
2,Dead in a year,I actually loved this machine but unfortunately it stopped working after 1 year. I tried the fixes offered by the online mavens- self cleaning cycle with vinegar etc.... you know the drill. If you're looking for a rental- get this machine. If you're looking for a lasting friend- buy a dog.
4,"Great coffee, but you need to be tall to make it","Makes great coffee, keeps it hot, carafe pours very nicely, has easy to use features, and it is a nice looking appliance. But the filler area uses a step guide which you need to have well lit and have to be able to look down into the resovoir to see, tough if you are on the shorter side. It really is a cumbersome system. A simple tube that can be viewed from the side would make this a perfect coffee maker."
1,quit after 9 months,"I loved this coffee maker, so much I got one for my daughter - but after 9 months - it just quit. I have not contacted the company yet - there is suppose to be a 3 year warranty. If anyone has any idea - or has this happened to anyone - all the readings went out - I unplugged it and plugged it back in and everything lit up. I reset all the times, etc - but coffee would not brew, automatically or timer."
2,Long term issues.,We have owned this machine for 3 years and 1 month. The electrical issues began around 35 months and declined from there. The coffee maker would shut off in the middle of brewing a large pot and we thought maybe it was something we were doing until it would not go on at all. The clock and auto on brew function will not set. The screw cover in the top of the machine fell out and will not stay in.We Changed filters and cleaned the machine out with vinegar and water as recommended every 2 months of so. The issue is that less than one month out of warranty they will not back their product and I understand that out of warranty means out of warranty but this coffee brewer has a life cycle of exactly the warranty period and that's it so know that you will be buying another coffee maker in 3 years when this one dies.
4,Good Coffee,"Great coffee maker. It's very simple to use and program.I love the digital buttons so you can set hours and seconds separately. It also tells you when it needs to be cleaned!The only draw back is the time display itself. It has no back light; so, in certain lighting, it's difficult to read.It makes great tasting coffee! Yeah!"
5,Better Tasting Coffee!,Looks beautiful (bought it in stainless/black) and makes better tasting coffee than any other one we have owned. Bought an additional 1 for our daughter AND 1 for our 5th wheel. Love it!
1,Not Durable,"Pros are good looks and great coffee while it works.Cons are it just doesn't hold up to moderate use (2-3 pots a day).Our experience is similar to some other reviewers. The machine clogsup. Despite multiple cleaning cycles, it stops brewing and justcreates steam and very strong coffee with only half or lesswater making it into the pot. The first unit lasted about aless than a year and was replaced under warranty, which was notfree(cost about the same a a cheap Mr Coffee). The replacementalso lasted less than a year."
1,Possible fire hazard,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed MetalIn the beginning I loved this coffee maker. It made a great tasting bold cup of coffee. I bought this unit in August 2011 and it died April 2012.It didn't just die though....like other reviews, the hot plate turned bright red (similar color as an electric stove burner) coffee boiling, and a popping noise along with smoke and the smell of an electrical fire. Luckily I was home when this occured and raced it out to our deck!Customer service was nice....shipped me out another one without any hassles and I received it quickly. (I used our camper coffee pot as a replacement while I waited.) They requested I send only the power cord to them so my shipping cost was minimal.My only issue with all of this...Do I want another one of these in my house????"
5,Best coffee machine yet,"I discovered this coffee maker when I bought a vacation home and it was included with the purchase. I was so impressed that I bought for our main residence also.Over the years I have bought and given away at least 12 coffee machines. This cuisinart coffee maker makes the best of my coffee beans, which I have always ground fresh with every machine I've owned. Perhaps it's the little coffee filter the water is processed through (don't know for sure), but it just tastes better."
4,Does what its supposed to,"Makes coffee. The coffee is hot. That's all I need and wanted. Having said that, hard to see into the water reservoir to see how much you're pouring in. But the marking on the glass pot works just fine to measure. So far, so good. You really can't go wrong with this pot. Also looks attractive on the counter. And unlike other obscure brands, if you break the pot (which can happen with glass) there seems to be replacement pots available in lots of places."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffeemaker,This is an excellent machine. It looks nice on the kitchen counter and is obviously very well made and warrants 5 stars except for 2 very minor infractions of coffee making. We drink a lot of coffee so we use it sometimes two times per day.1. I fill the reservoir from the pull-out hose faucet and have to turn on all the lights to see the cup level numbers down in that deep dark well. My wife is not tall enough to see the water-level numbers and has to use the carafe to fill the reservoir which entails a little more spilled water but nothing important.2. I cannot make a full pot of strong coffee (5 scoops) without the v-shaped filter from overfilling and running out the overflow port during the drip process. My solution is to just make 10 cups and use less coffee as a solution. (No I don't want to use a coarser drip-faster grind. This just makes weak coffee)
3,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this coffee maker, but have found it to be rather disappointing. Mainly, the basket containing the grounds constantly overflows, no matter how I grind my beans. It creates a huge mess and requires me to re-brew another pot hoping that it doesn't do the same thing. I don't understand such a flaw - I've never experienced this with another coffee pot. I also am unhappy with the design of the carafe, as the lid takes a good amount of wrangling to fit in place. I'm thinking I might go back to a less expensive Mr. Coffee brand, which has never failed to meet my standards."
2,another one dying!!!,"I bought this coffee pot 13 months ago and holding off on my review. I'm glad I did! The heating element is wearing out so I get a luke warm cup of coffee. I could microwave to warm it up but for what I paid for it, I shouldn't have to do this. The clock is hard to see and it isn't too see what you program."
1,3rd one in a year!!!,I keep taking these back to the retailer. First one lasted two weeks - hot plate stopped working. Second one ( on a roll now) lasted 6 weeks - same problem - wouldn't heat up. Now the grandaddy of them all - this one lasted 6 months. I would like to know why retailers keep selling these crappy coffeemakers at the expense of customers. Lot of poor production and perhaps they should make them here in the U.S. and let and engineer redesign the heating element instead of some poor crap made in some third world country. Amazon and other reatailers should be ashamed to sell such a poorly made product at the expense of customers. If you put pressure on these companies it would have much more clout than the outcry of some customer which for all accounts they could care less about!!!!!
5,works great,"This coffe maker looks great and works great. Very easy to use, great coffee. I like that you can adjust the temperature to your liking."
2,Nice but not dependable!,"I love this pot, and so ice tried to overlook one big, messy flaw - sometimes you'll end up with a counter full of grounds & hot water - for no apparent reason! After reading some reviews here, I'm going to try to use compressed air to blow out whatever might be stuck so the water/coffee gets into the pot. I'd rather that I had these problems every time I used it - then I could just toss it. But because it doesn't happen every time, I keep thinking I've found the solution - until the NEXT time it overflows! After reading many reviews, I'm now sending it back & will try another brand. Oh - for what it's worth, the design flaw that has the water reservoir at the BACK of the machine is really irritating."
3,"Makes great coffee, but has its problems","I've had this coffeemaker for a few years and it makes the best coffee of any one I've ever had. However, I would never buy it again because it turns itself off randomly. I thought it was just my pot that did it, but I found my niece has the same one and has the same problem. Then when I looked it up online, it appears that this is a common problem for everyone. My coffee will brew, I'll pour a cup and walk away, and when I look back, it's turned off. I turn it back on, and it turns off again. Some days it's fine, so there's nothing specific that causes the problem, it's just a problem with their switch, I presume.It's a shame, because as I said, it makes the best coffee."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200,I purchased this model based on a recommendation from a leading consumer magazine. It performs very nicely. It requires a little more coffee than my old unit to get the same full bodied taste.
2,Refurbished Warrenty,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker + Water FiltersThis is not stated on the website, but the warranty period for a refurbished unit is 90 days (not 3 years as you might be led to believe)."
3,"Great out the Gate, than slow like most in the end","After searching, reading much on line for a great coffee maker, love my coffee, this seemed the perfect match and...for some time it was Great, good cups of coffee, could rely on this. Now going into the 2nd yr., it's so slow, does not operate properly, just like the other one similar to this, you attempt to make 7 cups of coffee, and all you get is 3....not good at all anylong...so out to the trash, can't even donate it.Will step up into the two hundred dollar range now, hopefully with a longer warranty, better machine?"
2,electric meltdown,"My machine was less than 1 year old when it broke. I washed machine by hand and I must have gotten water where water should not go and the electronics zapped, machine broke beyond repair. I am disappointed that it can break so easily."
2,Tasteless hot coffee,"The machine looks great and it's easily programmable, however the coffee has no taste. I tried adding more coffee to bring out some flavor, but that produced bitter hot liquid that I wouldn't call coffee.If you prefer hot bland liquid to a tasty cup-o-java then this could be your choice."
1,Too many flaws to mention,Grew up in tornado alley and live within a few miles of a Marine base - both the sirens from childhood and the live artillery fail to compare with the sheer sound volume of this machine grinding coffee. This machine should be advertised as an alarm clock. The ability to vary coffee strength is limited to whether you want a medium or weak cup of coffee. Takes ten minutes to clean if you can get the grinding element out of the machine. Buy only if you haven't the funds to purchase a real coffee pot with a stainless steel exterior. Thank goodness I bought it at a place that allows for returns.
1,Satan's Coffeemaker,"In the mornings, when you need your caffiene the most, this coffeemaker is a sick joke. It makes sludge, not coffee, and I have tried every different brewing method with no success (water to grounds ratio, paper vs. metal filter, fine and coarse grind, grinding fresh beans) This coffeemaker has taken perfectly good coffee and turned it into bilge every time. I gave mine away today and I feel guilty about foisting it on others. Nice going, Cuisinart."
1,BUYER BEWARE! Cuisinart doesn't repair coffeemakers!,"For environment concious consumers who want one product and just repair it as time goes on, DO NOT BUY FROM CUISINART- they do not repair cofffee makers!If your coffeemaker is out of warrenty- you have to buy a new one- they won't repair it- even if you're happy to pay for it to be repaired!So, the broken one just goes into the landfull.Sad, very sad. isn't it?"
5,I love the Cuisinart...,"We purchased this machine for it's design and durability. We've been more than pleased with it. We have hard water and everytime we would take the caraf off the burner to pour a cup, it would drip water from the top and eventually that would destroy the burner... This one does not drop AT ALL, which I know will extend the life of it. We usually have to buy a new coffee maker each year, but I don't expect that to be the case with this one. Well worth the investment!"
4,"Great coffeepot, odd water area","We really like the look and the programmability of this coffee pot, but the water holding area is really hard to reach. Luckily we have it out from under the cabinets--if it was under an overhead cabinet it would be next to impossible to pour the water in, since it's in the way-back-right and you have to pour the entire coffee pot in until it's almost straight up, so you need a ton of clearance. I've read that before, too. Otherwise, it does the job great!"
2,Very disappointing.,"I received this coffee maker as a gift, and really wanted to love it. Unfortunately, it has not worked out well. The water tank is in an awkward place, and I seem to spill water every time I fill it. There is no way to see from the outside how much water is in the tank. These were minor annoyances, not big problems. However, after about 6 months the mechanism that stops the coffee from continuing to drip if you remove the carafe while it's still brewing stopped working. A real inconvenience for those of us who are not patient enough to wait for the pot to finish brewing before diving into our first cup of the day! Now, it makes a strange noise while brewing, and the coffee tastes terrible. I have no idea what's wrong with it, but I'm very disappointed. I had a Black and Decker for 8 years that never gave me any problems... this one is a dud after less than a year. I'm getting rid of it and buying another Black and Decker."
4,"Love the coffeemaker, but did have 1 overflow problem...","I purchased the 12-cup Cuisinart in January 2010 when I found that Braun no longer made a 12-cup maker, and really love it. I like the retro design (I purchased the black) and it makes good coffee, though I confess I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I did have one overflow problem shortly after purchase; I had read one other Cuisinart review stating they had also had the water overflow and destroy furniture, etc. I caught this within 15 minutes of it happening (it was set to auto brew), so no damage, thankfully. I did find in the instructions that if the coffee is ground too fine, that a clogging and backup can occur when using the gold filter. I have switched to paper filters and have not had the problem (so far) since.I would recommend this machine."
4,Very satisfied,"This coffee maker was easy to set up and use. It's also been easy to clean and the filter is good enough that it allows you to not use an additional paper filter. At the end of the day, it makes a great cup of coffee. We have enjoyed it!"
2,Poorly designed & below average coffee,"We have had this coffee maker for four months. When getting coffee before the brewing cycle is complete, the flow of liquid is supposed to stop while the carafe is removed. I noticed that clear hot water keeps flowing onto the hot plate around the side of the valve that stops the coffee while the carafe is removed. It obviously is seeping between the brewing basket and the cavity it rests in. It appears this is due to the badly designed plumbing in the lid hinge. I estimate that about a third of the hot water never makes it through the grounds.In addition the water only reaches about 165 degrees, far below optimum brew temp. Cuisinart makes some good products but this is not one of them. Wish I had bought a Bunn."
5,tough AND great coffee.,"My folks picked up one of these second hand at ,believe it or not, a flea market. I was amazed with the speed and quality of the coffee this machine makes. So I recently picked one up while visiting the States. I took it home. Plugged it into a cheap electrical converter( I live in Korea)and instantly saw smoke. I was convinced I had fried the machine even before I had the chance to use it. Armed with a new and better converter I crossed my fingers and switched it on. It still worked!!! Not only that but it made the hottest most delicious coffee I have had in a long time. This baby is tough, fast, and makes one heck of a great cup of coffee.My only complaint is that the cord is literally 12 inches long.That being said the product is superb. And my deliver came almost overnight.Do yourself a favor and pick this one up."
1,Should be recalled,"I have owned two of these machines, because I loved them for all the same reasons the positive reviewers do. The first just quit working after two years of use. Yesterday, the second machine started sputtering, sparking, and smoking. It was VERY HOT and dangerous. After looking in to it, this is a KNOWN problem with these machines-there are over 150 complaints on the US Government Consumer Safety website. Who knows how many more didn't complain. The company does not see this as a problem because ""the fail safe worked and the machine shut itself down"". I will not be replacing this machine with a third, because I'm convinced that had I not been in the immediate vicinity when the machine melted, my countertops would have melted, too. In my opinion, this won't be recalled until someone is gravely injured or killed in a fire that can be directly traced to this machine. Don't let that be you."
2,Short Life,Have had this Cuisinart 1200 for about 1 year. Yesterday it just quit working. I called the company and they had me do the vinegar rinsing to remove impurities and also had me rinse it to remove any debris in the way. I also removed the charcoal filter since they indicated it should be changed often. Of course they just happen to sell these at an inflated price. I will do without the filter.I did not believe either issue was the problem and it still does not function. I had already done the Vinegar cleaning previously. I owned a Mr Coffee unit and never encountered any problem with the unit.I must say I was disappointed and now will be required to package the unit up and return to Cuisinart. So much for a so called high end coffee maker.
1,Serious Fire Hazard!,"The unit started smoking and crackling, melting a hole in the bottom and causing the coffee to boil furiously from the extreme heat. I shudder to think of what could have happened if I hadn't been near the kitchen so I could unplug it and toss it out the door before it burst into flames. I googled the problem and found out my experience was neither isolated nor new. There are numerous complaints about the safety of this appliance. Why is it still on the market?!"
4,Quite good indeed,"The Cuisinart Brew Central makes a great cup of coffee. Finally a machine that makes the coffee as hot as I like it. I find the carafe's spout design makes pouring a bit difficult. And I really do miss having a water gauge on the outside of the machine. But I am happy, as long as the coffee is good!"
4,"Great coffee maker, fast delivery!","I'm in Afghanistan. I ordered this coffee maker 6 days ago. I recieved it yesterday, which was simply amazing since I am across the globe from where it was shipped. We brewed a pot in the office this morning and it makes some good coffee. I just want to show my appreciation. No real review, I'm just showing my thanks!"
5,Very Good Coffee Maker,"I'm very happy with this coffee maker, probably the best one I've had. I was pleased that the signal that brewing has finished is almost inaudible...to me, a good thing. It works fine without installing the water filter. I have a deep well with fantastic water (friends on city water fill up jugs when they visit), so I didn't want the expense and hassle of buying and changing filters. It's the first coffee maker I've had (around a dozen) that DOESN'T DRIP ON THE COUNTER WHEN I POUR COFFEE! I find filling it easy (I use the kitchen sink's spray wand to directly fill the reservoir), although as a minor point I would have preferred being able to see filling levels through a clear window on the outside instead of having to peer into the reservoir. Overall, good coffee, convenience and good looks. So far, a winner."
2,two design flaws with this coffeemaker,"I've owned this coffeemaker for a year now and have discovered that while it makes a good cup of coffee it has two design flaws. The water intake chamber and the filter chamber are placed so close to where you pour the coffee into the cone that grounds tend to ""spill"" into those chambers unless you are very very careful. I can imagine that over time this could clog up the water system within. Here's a little test to see if it's happening to you. Fill the water chamber then pour it out into a clear pitcher. No doubt you'll see grounds. This isn't good!"
2,coffee machine broke all of a sudden,"I have had this Cuisinart coffee maker now for alomst 3 years. I agree with all the previous comments about water condensation, leaking water and temperature problems. My biggest complaints are with the controls. My machine beeps and comes on with a mind of its own. its quite frustrating to have the aroma of coffee wafting through your house at 1am trust me!!!Last week though I went to set it for the next morning and it wouldn't work at all..I was quite puzzled, it just 'stopped' working for no apparent reason. Well i contacted Cuisinart and a very nice man phoned me back and said they were sending me a new machine...no questions asked !!! This I am even more puzzled at as no company has ever extended this type of service without receipts/and reviewing the product itself. Has anyone else had the same experience with this machine. is so i;d love to hear."
2,Broken button,"I bought the all black version of this coffee maker 5 months ago. Already the knob has stopped working. It still makes coffee, but no longer does it 'click' into place. The button will just twirl around and I have to find the right spot.The coffee is great, but the opening to the resavoir(?)is tiny.Disappointed..."
4,Watch out Starbucks!,"Overall great coffee maker. Needed to find a replacement for my 10 year old Mr. Coffee, and chose to go with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.-Nice design, the matte black finish disguises smudges and water spots.- Great cup-of-joe, everytime. Then again i've had the same results from a $9 Proctor Silex at the office. Not to mention i use premium Kona coffee from Hawaii.- Auto features are easy to use and program.- I concur with a previous review, in that the water resevoir has a small opening and is oddly placed. Pour carefully.- It comes with a water filter....cool.- Fork down an additional $10 for the replacement Gold Filter Basket (#4), it's worth it's weight in gold....pun intended.- My parents have been happy using the same machine over the past year."
1,Developed leaks,"I was happy with this unit until it started leaking after about a year to 18 months of use.It's put together with security-head screws (star torx with center post) which is the only tool I don't have - thus, cannot even attempt to fix.Not a good value considering its short life."
1,"Electronics caught on fire, do not buy","After about 2 years of use, the electronics at the bottom of the coffee maker started smoking and caught on fire. Upon reasearch of many other reviews, this or similar has happened to many others. Do not buy."
1,Wouldn't work had to return.,"Read directions, plugged it in filled it with water and it wouldn't come on. Got it to replace on that works most of the time but likes to cut off right after making coffee or just refuse to come on at all."
2,Good Coffee Maker Until It Breaks,"This coffee maker has been working well for a couple of years but, just today, the toggle switch stopped working. After much internet searching and a call to the customer service center, I have discovered that there is no way to fix the machine or have it repaired for a reasonable price. Of course, if the coffee maker weren't a gift and I had the receipt, I could've shipped the coffee maker to Cuisinart at my expense and had them fix it and they would've shipped it back at my expense. The customer service representative said that there was really nothing I could do to salvage the machine. She said just throw it away. So while the coffee maker is good otherwise, the absence of service options makes it a poor choice for a gift or for someone who wants a hassle-free experience."
1,Fire Hazard,"Repost -Decent coffee maker, but we've had ours for two years and it just caught on fire. Glad we were in the kitchen when it happened or we might not have a house now. Check out the federal consumer product safety commission's website to see the 87 other people that reported this issue. This thing should be recalled."
3,Great machine - until it began to overheat,"All in all, a great little coffee pot. Purchased in Dec. 2007, and just this week (Jan 2010) the heating base began to crackle (probably it was the glass pot crackling) then I saw smoke billowing out of the bottom of the unit. This was the first time anything like this happened with the Cuisinart. Next was the smell of burning electrical and I pulled the plug and ran it outside.Since it was still under warranty, Cuisinart will be replacing it. Keep in mind the ""limited"" part of the warranty is that you have to pay $10 for them to ship you a new unit (and you have to pay to send it back). Customer service was polite, but showed no concern about the burning and offered no explanation.Some web searching revealed this was something that, while not common, has happened before with this unit.I clearly am OK with the unit, as I am paying the $10 to get another one. But I don't think I will ever leave the house with the burner still on!"
3,Fathers Day Gift,"This is a nice coffee maker and makes a good cup of coffee, however I was somewhat disappointed due to the fact that the light does not come on in the clock and it does not beep when done. I would have sent it back but my husband wanted to keep it. When you pay thet much for something you expect it to be ok."
1,lasted less than two months,"Worked fine for about six weeks. I had noticed it created a lot of steam that rose up around the reservoir lid, but thought nothing of it. Then one morning it made four very strong cups, even though the wife swore she had used our normal 10 cup batch. So I tried it again, and the same strong 4 cups brewed, with the remaining water going up in steam. Took about 20 minutes to steam off. The self-clean light was blinking, so I followed the procedure, but again it wouldn't brew properly. At that point, I was concerned about safety, so arranged for a refund. Luckily, Amazon took it back. I'm a little peeved that Amazon is deducting from my refund the free shipping discount I originally got. In other words, I'm now paying the original $8 shipping. Weird."
5,Great Coffee Pot in a perfect color,I had a rough time finding this specific coffee pot in the metallic red color. My husband is a professional Chef so the Kitchen is his. He has it done in red and cream with hickory cabinets. Every department store I went to had the black or the stainless steel colors. Thank goodness Amazon saved me with having the last one in stock This goes perfect in the Kitchen and my husband loves the removable filter so you can clean the inside of the machine. Brews wonderful and gives us a great cup of coffee every time!
5,Coffee tastes great.,"Mr. Coffee. KitchenAid. Mr Coffee. Cuisinart. Mr. Coffee. Now...another Cuisinart. Purchased each of these 12-cup coffee makers over the course of many years. Enjoyed each one. Each one stopped working.January, 2013. Purchased the matte black Cuisinart. Good looks and great coffee. Three-year warranty."
5,ALL GOOD,AS USUAL YOUR SERVICE AND THE PRODUCT MADE UP THE EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS MY THIRD ONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE MY FIRST CHOICE.
4,clean up,"Product works as well as expected. Only drawback for me is , a little hard to clean completely where the grounds drip."
5,happy customer,"The product is everything I expected and for a great price. It makes coffee much faster than my old product and keeps it hot!Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless Steel"
4,Makes great coffee,"This is a good, solid coffeemaker. Lots of good features, for those who need them, but, mostly, the water gets to a good heat for brewing, and the controls make it possible to adjust how long the warmer plate stays on, so you can avoid burning the coffee if you don't get to it instantly.Cons: Just two. It's not so easy to pour water into the relatively small area in the back. You have to be careful to avoid spills. And, second, this machine has one of those screwy reservoir indicators that are like little steps inside the water tank. The only way to see how much water you've poured in is to peer into the tank and watch carefully to see whether the water has, for example, risen far enough to cover the '6' or '8' for that many cups. Harder for old eyes or if you don't have a light shining directly into the reservoir from the top.Neither con is a reason not to get the machine, but it is worth knowing."
2,Dangerous overheating after 2 years,"We loved this coffee maker -- until the electrical system went haywire after two years. First the programmable feature wouldn't work, then it refused to turn on manually. Finally (today), when it decided to let us have some coffee, it brewed it so hot that it achieved a rolling boil within the carafe and smoke was pouring out of it! Luckily I was standing nearby and unplugged it before it started a real electrical fire.You might wonder why I still give it 2 stars after this experience -- for two years, it was the perfect coffee maker!"
2,It lasted a year.,"I bought this for my daughter as a thank you for taking such good care of me following a surgery, and it died in a year. Way too much money for a year."
2,It only lasted one and half years,I loved this coffee maker until it died after only 1 1/2 years of service! The price we paid is way too high for the short amount of time we had the product - I will not buy another one.
3,"Ok coffee, bad design","Bought this as a replacement for a very good Braun machine which, however, turned up its toes and died for no reason, as Brauns apparently do. The Cuisinart makes good enough coffee, but when you use it, you will see that the clumsiness and stupidity of its design is breathtaking. It is not as easy to fill with water as other coffee makers, but you can get used to that. But try to brew a full, or close to full pot, and you will discover when you finish that there are coffee grounds all over the inside, and no way to clean it other than to unplug it, hold it under a spray (preferably) faucet, and wash them out. Possible, but clumsy and inefficient."
4,A pretty good coffee maker,This is a better coffee maker than the Mr Coffee I donated to good will. The only two down points are: the brew hold when you take the coffee pot out does not work all the time and the pot does not like it when you pour too fast. Other than those picky details this is a good coffee maker for the money.
3,"Reliable, but...","I've had this product for over a year now, and it has been working well. It's easy to program, and the burner keeps the coffee hot. The only problem is that the top it difficult to snap onto the coffee pot itself. Sometimes it takes several attempts to snap it securely into place. Other than that I like the design and performance of this product."
4,Very good,"Pros:-Stylish design-Quality construction, feels solid-Built-in water filter-Temperature controls for carafe burner and for making small pots of coffeeCons:-Must remove plastic taste with lemon juice before first use. Why can't they fix this at the factory?-Setting the timer is not intuitiveBottom line: after addressing the plastic taste issue, this machine makes really good coffee!"
3,pro and con,"this coffee maker has some good features-------auto turn off you can program for up to 4 hours after brewing, adjustable heat setting for the warmer, permanent coffee filter. And some things not so good----- The design for putting water in it is not so good, when you lift the lid, condensation runs down the back side of the coffee maker. Takes 10--12 minutes to brew."
4,Great Value,"Love this coffee maker, especially the option for 2-4 cups that boosts the temperature. That is my usual brew amount and i always wondered why my coffee just wasn't hot enough. Also love the ability to set how long until the auto turn-off. Add to it the warranty compared to other brands and it sells itself. I checked around on prices and this was a great deal.The only disappointment is that it is hard to see how much water you have added. I have worked around that so it shouldn't be a deal breaker."
2,burning and smoking after a year!,I had the dcc 1220 for a little over a year. It's hard to fill do to having to fill it from the back. On the plus side the coffee stays nice and hot. On the negative side the coffee machine started smoking and burning. The hot plate was red hot. I checked out the safterproducts.gov website and found I wasn't the only person who had this problem. May be a recall on this machine in the near future. So I say beware of this product.
4,DCC-1200,"Purchased unit at Costco for a great price @ $49.99 after old maker died. Research showed it was the best price. Some gave reviews that the unit was too high to fit under counters and that it was difficult to view the amount of water in the dispenser. The unit stands 14 in. tall. Unlike other coffee makers, the amount of H2O put into the water dispenser equals the amount coffee made. The coffee pot itself has good markers for the amount of water placed in the dispenser.Coffee stays hot. Feature to turn off unit after two hours is a godsend to not have to worry whether or not I have turned it off.Good coffee maker."
1,Fire hazard,"I purchased the 1200 model over a year ago and had no complaints until yesterday. I smelled smoke and my coffeemaker was red hot after being turned off for two hours. I unplugged it and it remained hot and smoldering for some time. Had I not been home, it could have been a house fire. I was not aware of all the incidents of fire with this product until know. Just Google Cuisinart fire hazard and see for yourself. I wish I had known before I purchased it."
2,Died after 7 months,This is a wonderful coffeemaker if it would just not die! I was hesitant to purchase when I read some of the review about the problems. Yet I was also impressed with the positive comments. Anyway after seven months the heating element just stopped working. I called customer support at Cuisinart and then did the troubleshooting as directed. That did not help however they assured me with there 3 year warranty I could send it in and they would repair or replace. I guess I'll spend another fifteen bucks to ship it back. Just a shame that an expensive great looking coffee maker would work like that.
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffee maker,"We finally have a great cup of coffee each morning. Water gets really hot, and coffee comes out tasting good. The coffee is made quickly. Well worth the money.I got it in 3 days even using the super saver shipping."
1,"great at first, but then...","I loved my Cuisinart coffee maker so much that over the next year I bought 2 more for other locations. The second one had the self cleaning light start blinking after the first pot of coffee was made and nothing could make it stop-the coffee seemed fine though. Four months after the original was purchased, it started having difficulty finishing the brew cycle...it produced, alot of steam and gurgling and only about 3/4's of the water I began with actually made it through the grinds. I tried cleaning it and it went downhill from this point. I thought that this was peculiar to this machine only, but alas, the same thing happened to the third machine. I'm now looking for a more reliable coffee maker.I own numerous Cuisinart products, but will not be buying another coffee maker from them."
4,Works great for me,"This is a nice looking coffeemaker, very retro and cool. As others have noted, it does have a small water reservoir opening but I haven't had an issue in pouring the water in. I just pour a bit more slowly. I also haven't had issues with backsplash and grounds on or in the sprayhead. My only issue at first was the odd popping noise here and there as it was brewing. It works fine otherwise and I don't even hear the noises anymore, not that they are that alarming to begin with. All in all, I love this coffeemake and have been very satisfied."
4,Nice coffee maker,I bought this for my in-laws to replace their old and outdated coffee maker. They are still using it 4 years later and seem to enjoy it. It works fairly simply.
2,"Nice coffeemaker, when it works. NOT BUILT TO LAST","If this machine would stop breaking I would give it 5 stars. The timer is nice and it looks sharp. I have dinged/dropped the kettle (glass) several times and it hasn't cracked.BUT, within a year it stopped working - couldn't move the water anymore.We contacted cuisinart as it was still under warranty, and got a new one shipped. A bit of an inconvenience, but fair.After another year, then new machine must have had a computer melt down. You hit brew, and it doesn't do anything. No sound, nothing.When we bought this machine we believed that we would get what we paid for vs. cheaper machines with similar features. Beware, in the age where everything is made in similar overseas factories with similar parts. This machine isn't built to last."
2,Not a good cup of coffee,"This coffee maker looks pretty decent and I thought a cuisinart would do the trick. But, the actual coffee really lacks flavor. I don't know if the water doesn't get hot enough of the pressure is not enough or what but, it really just tastes like a cup of coffee that you would get out of any $25.00 machine. Put your money towards something better!"
5,Cuisinart - Wonderful Coffeemaker!,"I bought this item and have been using it for a little over a week now, and I love it. It is very sleek and looks great on my counter. The carafe has a fantastic design and does not drip/spill when I pour a cup of coffee, or from pouring water into the machine! Love the options and settings - like the automatic shut-off and the water filter!I would've given this coffeemaker 6 stars; however, it just does NOT handle texting well! LOL"
2,It is not the best part of waking up,"We purchased our Cuisinart Brew Central last month and haven't had a decent cup of coffee yet. We have experimented with the water to coffee ratio, buy excellent beans,grind the moment before we brew and the coffee still has no rich coffee flavor. We have used the paper filters, the gold filter, both together thinking it might help and have used the 1-4 cup setting, which is for brewing smaller cups of coffee and provides 'double' heating' ( thinking that the water may not be getting hot enough) but none of these has altered the mediocrity of the finised pot. The coffee simply isn't flavorful. If we increase the amount of coffee, it simply becomes bitter.The carafe is difficult to remove from and replace onto the heating plate, but this is something we would consider insignificant if the coffee were excellent.It has been a disapointment."
3,Opinion after 3 years. . .,"I bought this 3 years ago. The coffee is not quite as hot as it used to be when I started using it new. It seems the heating mechanism is gradually getting weaker over time. This is the case even though I keep the temp setting on H (for high). I expected this brand's product to last longer before degrading. The 1-4 cup setting was always a gimmick and I could never tell the heating difference with it on or off. The main attraction of this machine is the visual appeal of the stainless steel, as it looks good on any kitchen counter. It looks more high quality than it actually is. Functionally, it is just an average coffee maker with all usual features."
2,"Excellent pot, one drawback","I bought this pot because it was rated #1 by the leading consumer testing organization. Very happy with it. Just wish it had an external fill level indicator as did my old Mr Coffee. With that addition it would be perfect. We fill ours with the sink sprayer, and its difficult to see into the fill tank to see level you're at.Update Aug 11, 2010 Coffeemaker died already. Will not brew and hotplate does not heat. 3 yr warranty, but what good is that if you have to pay shipping both ways and wait weeks for a replacement. Would not recommend due to poor quality/reliability. Its telling that at Cusinart website there is no mention of warranty or repair for defectie merchandise.Makes good coffee, but we've had some of the same problems others have highlighted: hard to fill, overflows, etc"
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffee maker (stainless steel),"I bought this because 1) It was rated #1 with consumer reports 2) I have stainless steel appliances 3) I have transitioned to the Cuisinart brand.I've had it for a couple of months and have had no problems, it looks and works great. If It has a con, it would be because it doesn't have a water level indicator on the outside of the unit. You have to lift the top and look down in the reservoir at a step indicator."
2,A sad outcome,"I have had this model coffee maker for 5 years now. I have liked it, used it, cleaned it regularly, ...Last year, within the warranty period, it just quit working, no power. This is an apparent common issue as they had all kinds of ""try this"" hints before they would take it back. Finally, they replaced it, with me paying shipping etc. plus a $10 handling fee.I presume the unit they sent back was a refurbished one, and 1 year to the day it dies.And no, they will NOT honor the warranty of the replacement unit. So I will be replacing my coffee maker but I guarantee it will NOT be with a Cuisinart product of any kind, ever again.Any company that cannot honor the quality of their products, even replacement products, does not deserve my money. And I should know - I am a Quality manager!Never again for Cuisinart."
2,Not happy - will return this,This is the first review that I have written. This coffee maker has several faults. 1. the caraf lid is a terrible design 2. coffee leaks out on to the heat plate when removing the caraf partway through brewing (this is variable and I can't figure that out) 3. the controls are not user friendly.For the money I think this is not worth it. I will be returning and buying a lesser expensive unit.
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffeemaker,"I love this coffeemaker. I bought this about a month ago. I did have a Mr. Coffee (will never buy again)and there is no comparison. The coffee tastes so much better. The coffee is hot, brews quickly, and it is very easy to program the settings. I like the 2 year warranty also. I am very pleased!"
5,Best coffeemaker I've had so far,"I usually refer to Consumer Reports to research purchases and this was at the top of the list. I haven't been disappointed. This makes a great tasting, HOT cup of coffee, the coffee doesn't taste burned when sitting on the warming plate for a while and it looks great to boot. Like other reviews the only negative issues I have are that the reservoir is a little tough to pour into and water tends to run down the back of the maker when you lift the lid. I leave the lid open at about a 45 degree angle when coffee is done brewing and that seems to help the latter problem. This has been a terrific purchase and I highly recommend it!"
4,My 12 cup Cuisinart Coffee Pot,I love this coffee maker. It brews the coffee in a matter of minutes and is easy to use and clean. I have bought many coffee pots over the years and this one works best for me. The design is clean and simple and fits the look of my modern kitchen. My husband drinks coffee all day long and the coffee stays hot for two hours before turning off so that is a great feature. I usually brew more than one pot a day and the coffee always tastes good made with this coffee maker. I highly recommend it.
1,Sorry,"I am sorry, I had to return this item. For one thing I only make small amounts of coffee, as a rule. Need the 12 cups for company, however it was very difficult for me to read the water level for 3 or 4 cups - among other things. Pleasant experience to return though."
2,"Good tasting and hot coffee, but messy coffeemaker to deal with","The pros for this coffeemaker are that programming is intuitive and simple, I never have to pull out the instructions to reset when we have power outages or fluctuations, and it makes good tasting and hot coffee. It is well made and durable. What I really do not like about it is that water and coffee drip everywhere. After brewing there is an accumulation of condensation on the underside of the lid on the top of the coffeemaker that runs down the outside of the back of the coffeemaker whenever you open the lid. The carafe drips coffee down the front under the spout so I always have to fill my coffee cup over the sink and then wipe down the side of the carafe before returning the carafe to the hotplate. I will not buy another one of these when this ones goes and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Makes great coffee but needs improvement,"Makes great coffee, and that's what a coffee pot is supposed to do. There are three things that need improvement. 1. It's plastic, not stainless. Don't be fooled by the looks in the pic. 2. Every time I pour myself a cup of coffee I end up with coffee on the counter top. The design does not allow you to pour without spilling unless you are careful to not pour out too quickly (and it doesn't take much to spill). 3. The third and most annoying feature is that the pause and serve never fully pauses. It always drips onto the hotplate while you are pouring a cup. Always.If they could improve those features, this would be a stellar coffee pot."
5,Great coffemaker,"I've had many coffeemakers over the years, but this one clearly stands above all the others. The coffee it makes is fine, and the features are comparable to others. The difference is in its durability. I've had a slightly earlier version of this for several years and it just works! No flimsy plastic, no melting of the burner support causing the carafe to tilt, no loss of the time display because water got into it. I've experienced all these issues with other brands, but this one just works. Highly recommended."
2,Help!!!,Just used it for the first time yesterday. The instruction manual states to flush it before using for the first time. So I brewed it without coffee. The problem is that only about half of carafe was filled. The rest of the water remained in the coffee maker. I emptied the coffee maker manually and did it again. This time I used the filter and coffee. I used water for 10 cups. Only about 1/3 of the water came out. The rest was inside the machine on top of the filter and in the reservoir.What am I doing wrong???Mike
2,Not so hot,"The best this coffee maker could do was to heat the brewing water to 150 F, or about 40 degrees shy of the ideal brewing temperature. I'll keep it until something better presents itself but Cuisinart ain't it!"
4,Ron,"Makes great coffee and very versatile. Big problem with no backlight on clock. Why have a clock in the first place if you can't see it. Other than that, nice buy."
2,disappointed,was purchased in oct 2010 for a christmas present. so started useing it after christmas. it is now may and it has just burned up! for 80 bucks i expect it to last much longer! 20 dollar pot at walmart lasts longer! which by the way is the one i have to dig out and start using again! will not buy again. guess i will stick to the cheap ones it doesn't hurt so bad when they burn up!
5,Mighty Fine Cup of Joe,"One of the things that I first noticed when I brewed a pot of coffee in the Cuisinart DCC-1200 was the fact that the coffee grounds where not all over the place in the brew basket. All of the other coffee makers that I have owned have managed to disperse all of the grounds up the sides of the basket and even onto the top of the spray unit. With the Cuisinart DCC-1200 the grounds are pretty much in the same place as they where before brewing. Why is this such an interesting observation to me? It shows that the water is showered onto the grounds at even pressure and speed. This produces a much more consistent cup of coffee, the grounds are evenly steeped. I notice the difference in taste from my previous coffee makers. I am pleased with the quality and I am fully enjoying a better cup of coffee."
1,Nice looking but defective!,"As with all the other 1 star reviews, I too have the same complaints about this coffee maker. I had one year of use out of ours and the burner plate just burned up one day-smell of burning plastic and smoke rolling out from it. I called customer service and have a replacement on it's way. If the replacement goes bad, I am not giving Cuisinart another chance. I will go with Mr. Coffee."
1,TO MANY MINOR PROBLEMS,SHOULD HAVE A WATER GAUGE ON THE OUTSIDE. USING THE COFFEE POTNUMBERS ARE HARD TO READ. ALSO HARD TO POUR INTO THE MACHINE.I WILL SAY IT MAKES GOOD COFFEE.JOHN
2,"Looks Nice, But Clunky","This machine looks nice, but I'm not sure how it got so many positive reviews. The brew it produces is pretty good (not as good as the Braun that burned out on me), but I'm not sure it was designed for use by humans.Let's see... we can make the lid lift up instead of a swing out basket design because nobody would ever place this unit under a cabinet. Ooh, and I bet we could make the water intake really, really small so that folks stumbling in wee hours can make a mess on the counter. And, how about the lid on the carafe, well.... couldn't we have a lid that snaps on super tight? .. we can really get under people's skin with that one.Making a pot of coffee shouldn't be a chore. The engineers at Cuisinart need to get a clue, not a bonus, for such a poor design."
1,Good coffee but terrible design for filling water - Returned to Amazon,"I bought this as a replacement for a Braun 10 cup as the Cuisinart is larger with 12 cups. Makes good coffee, but the design is terrible for filling it with water. The opening for water is on top and shares the same opening as the coffee filter. The opening for the water reservoir is very small and it is hard to empty the carafe completely. Also you need two hands to remove the lid for the carafe. It isn't a hinged carafe lid like most others; it is securely snapped on and must be removed with your free hand to add water. So when we make coffee EVERYDAY it is a pain to open the carafe, then a tedious job to pour the water into the reservoir. Also, the design makes it too easy to spill water into the fresh grounds (not good if you make coffee the night before) because it is the same opening. I wanted this to work but the Braun is back on my counter until I find a better 12 cup coffee maker..."
2,18 months and throw it away,"Lots of problems with this unit but prior reviewers have mentioned them all. Mine lasted 18 months and the heater has died. We only use it once a day, 5 days a week and to have it break this quickly is totally unacceptable.Nice looking unit but I will take reliablity over beauty (for coffeemakers) every time.Don't buy this unit, you will regret it."
5,I bought it mostly for the appearance,"I like the stainless steel appearance of this coffeemaker. It matches our other appliances very well, and works well also. The programmability and self clean features are nice and work well."
2,double filter blues,"unless we used a paper filter in addition to the metal one, the water went through so fast that whole areas of the ground coffee didn't even get wet. using a double filter improved things somewhat, but we found it impossible to put enough coffee into the machine to make 12 cups of decent strength coffee.am i missing something?"
1,"Looks Great, But","Looks great on my counter, but sub par coffee maker. Hard to fill the water without missing. Not hot enough coffee. Filter basket rips easy where plastic meets mesh. Excess steam producer; one has to add extra water to compensate. Expect water always to drip onto your counter every time you open the lid. Major redesign required. Shame on Cuisinart."
2,They catch on fire,I bought this at fred meyers around may 2011 and today 12/18/2011 the coffe pot started making noise and smoking .Good coffee maker just not worth burnin your house down. Check out consumer affairs on the dcc 1200 model NOT GOOD [...]
5,Cuisinart DC1200 Coffeemaker,"After an exhaustive search covering many fine coffeemakers, including bonn, braun, melitta, and others, and desiring a simple machine without any motors, complex moving parts, or other gizmos to fail, I settled on this machine, the cuisinart DC1200. I also had a year's prior experience with it, and knew it to be reliable, easy to operate, and comfortable with its retro design. It also comes with a very fine permanent gold tone filter, which means no buying paper filters all the time. Also, it is a bit hard to find 12-cup machines that are also better machines. I am delighted with this machine, and have no need to keep up with the development of newer coffeemakers."
5,Best yet!,"This coffeemaker comes with features I LOVE! The adjustable warmer keeps the coffee from burning while it's keeping warm. Nothing is worse than the smell of burning coffee when you're still enjoying your first cup. Also, the 1-4 cup button that focuses the water on the little ground coffee in the filter to make sure your coffee is the right strength. I like that it beeps when it's ready and beeps when it's about to turn off after keeping the coffee warm. It's a little reminder that you'd better pour the last cup, and that way you don't go in the kitchen only to realize the coffee has gotten cold! Yuck!I have had Mr. Coffee, Black and Decker, Braun and even Starbucks. This is the best!I've purchased two additional of these for Christmas gifts."
2,Good machine with a fatal design flaw,"I've had three of these in my b&b and they have worked fine producing 1-3 pots a day until they don't work. Each time, the machine has overflowed, sending grounds into the water reservoir and clogging the water intake tube. This happens if the filter basket is not seated JUST SO and thus the valve doesn't open. Employees who are not attuned to this idiosyncrasy eventually get it a millimeter off and the machine shuts down. Usually, the problem cannot be fixed. I've tried high pressure air and water with no luck in unclogging the line. At the moment, I have three dead coffee makers and am looking for a new brand."
3,The DCC 1200 has Short Life,"I bought this coffee maker a little over 3 years ago and was so thrilled with it I talked my sister into getting one. She loved it too, except for the times her husband complained about the location of the water reservoir. I didn't have a problem with the location or size of the reservoir. However, within 2 years of my sister's purchase, the on/off toggle switch starting working only intermittently. One day it would be fine, the next day-no coffee. Now the same has happened with mine...working intermittently as well. This morning I sit without coffee. I am surprised and disappointed that this coffee maker has such a flaw. The old fashioned coffee makers of yesteryear lasted much longer. What a shame."
4,Not 100% happy,"This coffee maker was a replacement for a Cuisinart Brew Central 14 cup coffeemaker which I had loved. This coffeemaker makes an excellent cup of coffee but I'm disappointed about two things. First of all, ita size is taller than the other one even though it makes less coffee, therefore its height is too big for the space on the counter. Far more importantly, there is no window to show how much water is being poured into the coffeemaker except to put exactly the right amount into the caraffe at the beginning...and I find that very annoying."
3,not the best customer service,this was the second coffee pot i had purchased in this make/model. after 14 months it is clogged. the company requires us to send it for an evaluation which they indicated could take up to 2 weeks. then if it is deemed unfixable they will ship one within another week. with the shipping to and from cuisinart we decided to just purchase a different company's coffeemaker. we were quite happy with the model both times but dealing with a replacement because there is no way to free up a clog was quite unsatisfactory.
2,Avoid...(If you want hot coffee),"This coffee maker is average. I would even say it is slightly below average at that. The coffee it brews is lukewarm (even when I used the 1-4 cup setting which supposedly double heats the water). If you want hot coffee, I would advise you get the Bunn machines. I ended up getting a Bunn (which was cheaper) and it is so much better then this. The build quality is below average as well. I was kind of shocked that I had to return this item considering how many positive reviews it received. Avoid."
3,"Good coffee, bad machine","When our coffemaker died of old age and overuse, my wife wanted a programmable coffeemaker. She drinks decaf; I drink high test. Her pot could be ready at 5:30, she could pour it in an insulated carafe and (God bless her) make my pot.Though it makes good coffee, I kind of hate this machine. I'd like to slap its designers.For years I have had a succession of wonderfully designed, inexpensive Braun Aromaster pots that make great coffee. This Cuisinart thing pales in comparison. When you open the top, condensate drips on the stove or countertop. The carafe, rather than having a hinged lid, has a hard-to-remove-and-reinstall snap-on job. The reservoir is really hard to pour water into, especially if your machine is under a vent hood or overhanging cabinet.What idiot designed this thing?When it dies, I'm going to be Braun again.I wrote this in the summer of 2007. It is now the winter of 2012. The coffeemaker is still going strong. I'm adding a star for longevity."
1,CUISINART COFFEEMAKER,"This coffeemaker makes great coffee, but it is too tall which makes filling the water reservoir difficult. However, the biggest problem is the leakage of water from the steam under the lid of the unit. It leaks water every time you raise the lid even if you let it sit for hours after brewing the coffee. The water tends to leak down the backside of the unit and all over the electrical cord. I wish I had listened when I read the other reviews on this item as others had already had the same complaint. It is not just a LITTLE water, but a real electrical hazard to say nothing of the constant mop up it needs each time you brew coffee!"
1,Read warranty closely,"Came in kitchen this am, half a pot of joe AND a smell of burning wires or plastic.Called cuisinart, you have to pay shipping BOTH WAYS..... So on top of roughly $80 coffee maker, they are wanting $30-$40 to replace it. Very disappointed and won't buy again."
1,Dangerous Coffee Maker...Caught fire,"We bought this coffeemaker after reading several reviews and a recommendation from a friend. A few months after we bought it, our friend emailed us to warn us that her coffeemaker had caught fire. One morning after it finishing brewing, the coffee maker made a loud popping sound. Luckily our friend had forewarned us about her experience and we were actually in the kitchen when the appliance started smoking. Already aware of what was happening, we quickly unplugged it and brought it outside. Clearly if we had not been in the kitchen at the time, we could have had extensive damage from a fire. The smell of burning plastic lingered for several hours.DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER. After searching the internet, there were several reviewers that had the same experience. We can't understand why this coffeemaker has not been recalled."
1,Burned up,"After only 9 months of use, my Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffee pot burned itself up. Walked into kitchen for my second cup of coffee and found it smoking from all around bottom and the smell of an electrical fire. Checked out Consumer reports website to find same complaints posted at least 10 times every month. Cuisinart will not respond to my phone calls and questions about the problem. I will never buy another Cuisinart product because of the customer service alone. Plus I do not want another fire hazard in my house!"
1,Stopped working after 14 months,"Faulty product--save your $$$. Owned the DCC-1200 for 14 months, cleaned it regularly, and yesterday it simply stopped brewing. A short search on the web revealed that many other customers have had the same (or worse) problems. Stay Away."
1,A really bad investment,"I drink a lot of coffee and I've owned a lot of coffee makers over my 64 years. None has lasted as short a period of time as this one, about a year and 2 months.That was also my experience, unfortunately, with Cuisinart's entry into the single cup brewer market. That $200 investment lasted slightly less than a year.Both machines were, in my opinion, as attractive as any on the market. And while they worked, they worked well.But they are VERY short lived. I may someday buy another Cuisinart product, but that is not likely. And, if I ever do, it certainly will NOT be a coffee maker.This coffee maker died without warning this morning. Luckily I still had my old, not quite so good looking but very dependable Krups on hand. After its 14-month exile, it worked perfectly and without complaint when I put it back into service in place of the useless Cuisinart."
5,Nice for the price,"I've been reading reviews about this coffee maker and others for days, and I got tired of it, so I bought this one and I'm glad I did. All of the reviews I've read seem to have the same complaint, ""Leaking"". I started to think about that, and its my experience that ALL of the coffee makers I've ever had leak at some time or another, so I bought this one out of pure exhaustion and I recommend it. It hasn't leaked yet, but I'm sure it will, and when it does I won't be surprised or even disappointed its a nice coffee maker for the price."
2,Great When It Works,"I love the design and functionality of this coffeemaker. However, I've had 3 of them and each one failed after less than 2 years. It's some flaw in the heating element. I do know that reliability seems to be a problem with many coffeemakers and problems are not exclusive to this one. But for the price, I'd rather go with cheap if I'm going to end up replacing it every 12-18 months anyway. I don't use the clock/timer function and there are other features on this machine that I don't use or need.If you don't mind spending $80+ and taking the chance, go ahead. You will love this one while it works."
3,Nice and nauty,"This is our second DCC1200 coffee maker. Loved the first one so much we bought another - ""but"". The first maker lasted over 5 years before the heating element burned up. That was not a disappointment, five years is really quite good for a coffee maker. Here is were the ""but"" comes in. The second one we bought only lasted just under 2 years before the element burned up. Is the quality going down hill already?. Now we need another maker and we are not sure if it will be another DCC1200."
4,Great product & stylish,"I'd initially purchase the Krups Aroma Control thinking that was it, until the coffee came out lukewarm; quickly refund the Krup.Decided to give Cuisinart DCC-1200 a try, was afraid of previous review about spillage from condensation. Upon trying, I am now absolutly happy over this buy. Apparently, there is NOW a water channel in the back for the lid when it's open to collect the condensation. Overall, very impressed with temperature, which came out hot, quality of the caraffe was good. Only drawback is this thing is high for a coffee machine. Had to get up close to pour the water. Other than that, the coffee was hot and there was no spill in the back. It was also nice to hear 5 audible beeps once the coffee finish the brewing cycle."
1,Failed to work even one year,"This sleek looking machine was such a temptation to purchase...so I did. However, after only a few months, it failed to draw water up the machine. It was a horrible dissappointment since we paid 70.00 for it at Costco. We even used bottled water.We then thought to purchase the even nicer looking Cuisinart product that stores the brewed coffee in it's sleek stainless tank not a pot - alas it was a piece of junk too! 4 months and it was doing the same thing as the other.It's back to the old Mr. Coffee for our home. It doesn't look so good - but it works!"
1,Piece of Junk so far!- Fixed it!,I received the DCC 1200 last week. It stopped after the water was halfway done. I sent it back and received another one yesterday. SAME PROBLEM!I called Cuisinart and they told me it is also defective. Cuisinart thentold me to tell Amazon to stop sending me defective units!Let's hope the third time's a charm. Otherwise they can take thisthing and shove it!Edit:I feel completely stupid. You have to have the top on thecarafe in order for it to push up the button on the coffeedispenser. This is for the brew pause function. When pulledout the button release stopping the drip.I'm coffee maker stupid :-)Anyone having the same problem make sure your cover ison.I'll call Cuisinart and have them make note of it tosave them some unneeded returns.Can I change my rating up from one star?I don't see anyway to do so.
5,"Good Design, Good Coffee","This coffee maker has the features we want, is easy to use, makes a good cup of coffee, and looks good on the counter top.This coffee maker comes with a gold filter. No more paper filters to deal with. We just rinse it off when we're done. And we like the taste of the coffee.This coffee maker allows us to make 12 cups or 1 cup of coffee. It has a 1-4 cup feature on it so that when we make less coffee, it still tastes good.This coffee maker has a timer that is easy to set up and use. We pour in the water, put in the coffee, and the next morning our coffee starts brewing automatically.This coffee maker has a nice feature which allows us to set the time for the warmer. We have it set so that it shuts off after 1 hour.This coffee maker looks good on the counter. We noticed it is the same one used on the set of the tv sitcom ""Two And A Half Men"".In comparison to other coffee makers, I think this one gave us the most features for the money."
1,Disappointed,"I have had the Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffeemaker for 2 years. I love the style of this coffee maker and have been very happy with the coffee it produces, but not its quality. This coffeemaker replaced a $25 Mr. Coffee brand coffeemaker that lasted 12 years. After 2 years the coffeemaker will only intermittently switch on. Unfortunately, quality does not appear to come with the $80 pice tag of this model. I guess it is back to Mr. Coffee for me."
5,Nice!,I really like the style of this coffee pot. I have no negative comments about it! I liked the first one so much that when I bought a summer home I just bought a second one. Measure the water in the carafe before you pour the water into the coffee resovoir for accuracy!
5,Love this coffee pot!,"I've been doing lots of research on coffee pots and decided on this one. The price was good and it has all the features I like. My favorite feature is the warmth setting. It really keeps the coffee hot for a long time. Also, when there's a power outage the settings on the coffee pot are not lost. The clock is not messed up and if you have it set on the timer, everything is saved. It's also very attractive."
2,cannot recommend this product,"Have had this coffee pot in my office for 5 months now, and I regret the purchase. First off, it has a few annoying features -- small area for pouring in water (requiring careful aim); no visible water measure on the side or front of the machine (only a ""stepped"" measure in the water reservoir itself that is difficult to read precisely); several non-removable parts around the coffee filter area that are difficult to clean. It also can handle only so much ground coffee in the filter -- to make a full pot at the strength I like means that I end up with a lot of grounds in the coffee. Then we started getted performance issues. It's supposed to stop dripping when you remove the carafe mid-brew, but that stopped working almost immediately. And now the brewing process has slowed down to the point where it takes 15 minutes to brew not even a full pot. I wish I had returned this early on when I had the chance."
3,"I cannot use it, so i return it.","Since i bought it to use in Hong Kong, the voltage is not suitable to use, so i have to return the goods. I really like this type of coffer maker, but....., so i am unhappy."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200,"I have purchased the identical product 6 years ago and found it to be good in all aspects with one exception --The heating element is subject to corrosion and eventually leaks. Because the part is not replaceable, the entire coffee maker must be disposed of and replaced. It is a waste to dispose of an appliance that's perfectly good except for one defective part that could be replaced. (Consider e-waste, landfills and carbon foot prints)The manufacturer should re-design the heating element to make it less prone to corrosion OR provide a replacement part and enable easy access to the heating element. It could be replaced by removing the 2 pieces of tubing and 2 wires that connect with the heating element."
2,Good coffee taste but unreliable,"We used this coffeemaker satisfactorily for six months and it went dead. The only thing that now works is the red light. I never had an electric coffeemaker fail before and when it does, the warranty isn't helpful. Are you going to go without coffee for a few weeks while you wait for a replacement?"
2,Cuisinart dcc-1200mr brew central 12 cup coffee maker.,Coffee does not taste good and not hot. Not satisfied with the performance of coffee maker. My wife and I have used it several times.
2,Born 12/10/2010. Died 11/28/2012.,"Just another electrical failure like all the other reviews. Lotsa' smell, some smoke, big stain on counter top. Lasted longer than some but not enough to justify buying another."
3,Ok while it lasts,Bought this in August of 2012. Enjoyed it for 15 months. One morning it just would not do anything. Called Cuisinart and they said that it should have a vinegar and water cleaning. Followed their advise and still nothing. Then I was told that nothing could be done and realized it was headed for the junk pile. Really sad because I liked using it.
3,OK while it lasted...,This coffee pot died after 2 years and 7 months. It was OK while it lasted. Seemed to be a bit slow to brew a potful.
4,21ST CENTURY PRODUCT,"LOVE IT. ONCE I FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE, NOT LIKE YOUR MR. COFFEE TYPE MACHINE. MAKES FAST, GREAT COFFEE. LOVE THE FACT I CONTROL SHUT OFF TIME, CAN GO UP TO 4HRS AND TEMPERATURE. AMAZON CARRYING QUALITY PRODUCTS.HAPPY IN TEXAS."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200-great buy for price!,"I really love this coffee maker. The features make the couple of inconveniences bearable.I appreciate the beeps that alert me when the coffee is ready. The variable temperature settings are great. It lets me know when it is time to clean it. It also has the 1-4 cup button for a slower brew for lesser quantities.The setbacks include:The lid condensation spills off the back onto the countertop when opened. I try to open slowly to allow as much to slide back into the reservoir.The reservoir is smaller than other coffemakers and I need to take my time filling it. The measure marks are inside the unit and hard to see but I use the carafe to measure the water anyway.Regardless of these, I am very happy with this coffeemaker!P.S. My carafe does not drip!"
5,So Far,"I don't know what it is about coffee makers, but I generally don't have them for longer than 3 months. Clogged innerds, cold coffee, etc. Generally I make only one pot a day, and I don't know what the problem is. I read many reviews and chose this coffee maker. Hopefully this one will last.I chose the model with the black matte finish, so I am very pleased with the appearance of the machine. More importantly, its functionability is my concern. I cannot function in the morning without my coffee. I have owned this maker for just over a week, and it still lets me steal my first cup in the morning, without leaking all over. So far, it makes a delicious cup of coffee and it is ""hot"". So nice. I'm not fussy about buttons and dials, but if I don't have my glasses on, I cannot read the fine details. I just want to turn it on and have my coffee. So far, this machine has not let me down. I will write again in 3 months to see if it survives my usage."
2,Disappointed,Sending it back for the 2nd time. Grinder just stops working. I didn't have this problem with our old Cuisinart Grind and Brew....
1,Good looking but dumb,Relatively inexpensive and easy to clean but the LCD Digital Clock isn't back lit and I can't read it so that stops me from programmed brewing and the high setting for the heater plate only keeps the coffee lukewarm at best. Nice looking gear but not functional.
1,irritating to use!,"The lid of the pot is very difficult to remove, also the port into which one pours the water is in an awkward location resulting in spills. Apparently no one at cuisinart ever hear of human factors engineering!"
1,DANGEROUS!,"I heard coffee boiling, ran into kitchen, and saw smoke coming from cord where it went into coffeemaker. Unit had been turned off earlier in the day. I carried unit outside where it continued to smoke for a few minutes. We bought unit in Feb. 2011. I have e-mailed Cuisinart twice, but have received no response. Luckily I was home and our whole kitchen didn't go up in flames."
3,ok while it worked,"I had mine for about a year when it suddenly stopped working. It was great while I had it but I'm frustrated that I spend approx. $100 and am now looking for another coffee pot. I won't be getting another one. I don't even brew coffee every day, and if I do, only once!"
1,Shoddy,"I bought this coffee maker for Christmas...less than three weeks later the (glass) bottom of the coffee pot detached from the rest of the pot while I was pouring water in. How does that happen?Even more frustrating than shoddy construction and materials, is Cuisinart's refusal to respond to my request for replacement. This is a company that has absolutely no regard for its customers. Spend your money somewhere else..."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1200BW Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker,We received the coffeemaker very quickly when I placed the order and were very happy with the way it is easy to use. I especially like the no-drip pour feature of the decanter and the size fits our needs perfectly.
1,Only brew function working,"So disappointing could have got a more functional coffee maker at war greens for $10 , it was filthy , clock , alarm and temperature doesn't work , also unable to send it back"
2,If you like cold coffee this is for you,"The maker looks cool but it makes cool coffee.even though the pot is on high for temp., it makes cold coffee.I don,t get it. Every cup has to go into the micro. Before we can drink it.Look somewhere else."
2,A good machine gone bad,"I purchased this Cuisinart Brew Central coffeemaker a little less than one year ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it until now. It made excellent, HOT coffee, was easy to use and clean. However, it has now stopped pumping water into the filter rendering it useless. Attempts to contact Cuisinart about replacement or repair (since it has a 3-year warranty) have been unsuccessful. I've owned many coffeemakers over the years and none have broken as quickly as this one."
4,Great cup of coffee everyday,"We've had this coffeemaker for about a year, and every morning it gives us a great cup of coffee to start our day. The 1-4 cup brewer button feature double heats the water so it's as consistent as a full pot. (I wonder if that could have been the problem with the negative March 10, 2007 review about the coffee not being hot enough? Maybe they didn't use this feature and that's why the complaint?) As well, during the weekdays we use the timer feature to set our coffee to be ready for us in the morning.The only flaw we've started to notice lately is that every so often some coffee leaks onto the warmer plate instead of going into the pot. This could be due to the spring-loaded filter holder getting caught. We just remember to turn the pot handle a certain direction to the side and this helps alleviate the problem.Aside from that, we've been extremely impressed and pleased with this machine."
5,Best Coffee Maker I've ever Owned,"This coffee maker brews a mean pot of coffee. For years I'd been baffled by the fact that, although I enjoyed coffee whenever I went out to eat, I never enjoyed it in my own home. I tried various brands of coffee and went through several low-end coffee makers before I finally decided to stop being cheap and just shell out for the excellently reviewed DCC-1200. I'm very glad I did. I've had it for just over a year now and it's been brewing phenomenal coffee since the day I plugged it in. I haven't even replaced the charcoal water filter (which I know I should have, and promise I'm about to!) and it's still brewing great coffee. I also own a french press, and while that device does outshine the DCC-1200 it doesn't win by much, and this coffee maker definitely wins the convenience battle. Don't waste your time being cheap like I did - just buy this coffee maker. You'll be glad you did."
2,Stopped working after 18 months,Purchased coffee maker after reading the mixed review. Coffee maker brewed good coffee and worked great until 1 week ago. Will contact Cuisnart warranty support for replacement.
2,Excellent but died a quick death,"Purchased this product 13 months ago and it makes a delicious hot brew that most regular coffee drinkers would be very pleased about. However!!!! and although I recall some comments at that time that this Cuisinart will die prematurely, I nevertheless made the purchase. Well fast forward 13 months and after approximately 200 brew cycles in that time, this one bit the dust. Very disappointed even though it has a 3 year warranty due to the catch of having to ship it to the manufacture on your dime and also include $10 for return shipping after it is repaired. This warranty costs about half the cost of a new machine that only promises you a refurb or repair. JUST MAKE A BETTER ELEMENT CUISINART. After all, it's the 21st century."
2,Coffee Maker Gone Mad,"Purchased this coffee maker about two years ago. While working, made fine coffee, but the programming is really weird, so we used it in ""on-off manual mode"". We have treated the unit well and according to instructions (periodic flushing, etc.). Just yesterday, the control functions went crazy. The LCD display went blank and the ""on"" toggle switch did not work. Sometimes the time display comes on when you plug it back in and some times not. Set the time, and it loses the setting. Unit simply will not brew coffee when you fiddle with it and get it to start...beeps off after only a few seconds. Visited many fixit websites, but nothing helps (several said incorrect ""Auto Off"" setting, but that did not fix it). Getting a new unit today...I will guarantee that it will not be a Cuisinart."
1,fire hazard!,I have had Cuisinart Coffeemaker's in the past and have always been pleased with them. I was pleased with this unit until I too was sitting in the kitchen after having just brewed a pot and sure enough I heard a popping and clicking noise. Obviously I was curious why my coffeemaker was making this sound until I smelled burnt plastic and soon realized that wasn't steam coming out of the top! We had purchased this unit about a year ago as well. Pretty disappointing to say the least. It would have been even more disappointing had I already left for work. I was checking Amazon to purchase another one and started reading the reviews when I learned about other folks very similar experience. Obviously this would be a different story had my house caught on fire. Don't buy it.
3,Broke after 9 months,"I liked it while it worked but grr..... our unit broke after nine months. Called Cuisanart for a replacement since its ""warrantied for 3 yrs"". Its going to cost me $20 in shipping to get a replacement. I am not happy."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have to say I just loved this coffee maker when it first arrived, you had to make sure the coffee ground basket is pushed all the way down, there is a little extra click otherwise the coffee will overflow and cause a big mess. I could live with that, but the Bad news is it completely stopped working in barely a years time!! Unless you don't mind that you'll need to buy a coffee pot every year Don't waste your money!! :("
2,Good coffee; not reliable,"Great looks, and really good, hot coffee for the first two years.Then it just started turning off right after brewing.3 year warranty requires I pay shipping back for repair and $10 fee;It was just easier to buy a less expensive replacement.I expected a longer life for this product, considering the price of the Cuisinart."
5,Great Pot,"It actually came the very next day. I thought I made a mistake in my delivery options, but I didn't.This is a great coffee pot. I still have my original one for about 4-5 years now. I broke the crafe and figured for a few dollars more I could get a brand new coffee pot. This way I get the gold medal screen which was starting to get a little old anyway and a filter etc. I don't know why but my self cleaning light never came on. I couldn't tell by the taste of the coffee that it needed cleaning though. I did order the wrong color though. I thought the one I wanted was Black and Chrome, and I really wanted the Sainless Steel to match the other apliances. My bad."
4,"Reliable, but coffee tastes weak to us.","This coffeemaker is just OK. I had high hopes for it. We had a Mr. Coffee 4 cup that began to leak. It was a good little coffeemaker which they don't make anymore. I'm glad this Cuisinart doesn't leak and that it is programmable but so far the coffee has tasted weaker to us. We may have to play with the amount of coffee some more, but so far we haven't found the right amount. Haven't had it for long but it seems like a reliable coffee maker which is what we were looking for."
1,Second one to burn out in less than 4 years,"As I was making coffee after our July 4th BBQ, I smelled something horrible. It was the coffee maker. It brewed one last pot and died. This is the second coffee maker of this model that has died on me. I generally use it to make 4 cups each morning so I am not a heavy user. Needless to say, I'll be shopping for something other than a Cuisinart."
1,"Broke after a year, Cuisinart wants me to ship back at my expense and charge me $10 for warranty replacement","Worked OK until it stopped heating water. Then Cuisinart wanted me to ship it back at my expense AND pay $10 for the privilege of obtaining a replacement. Some ""3 year warranty"". I'll never buy another piece of junk from Cuisinart again."
1,Defective!,"We just got this about a month ago, after our old Cuisinart stopped working. We loved the first couple of weeks with this coffeemaker, but for some reason it has stopped working. When we put water into the machine, it sounds as if it's brewing but it's not. Does anyone know why this would be? Interestingly, this is why we got rid of our last Cuisinart which was carafe style (I forget the model #) but we figured it was a couple of years old and broken. But after only a few weeks with this new one, the same thing is happening. I tried it today with just water and no grinds to see if it would work and that didn't work either. So no, I m not happy with this product."
1,WARNING!,"As I'm sure you'ver read, the Cusinart 1200 DC makes great coffee and I agree that it does. However, I have purchased two in the last few years. The first one worked fine for a couple of years and one morning after brewing I started smelling that distinct smell of electrical malfunction from overheating. That time it was the power cord.I liked the taste of the coffee brewed with the machine so much that I decided the malfunction was a fluke and purchased another one about 8 months ago.This morning after brewing a second pot, there was smoke pouring out of the bottom of the unit! Thankfully I was in the room and immediatly pulled the plug and took it outside.I initiated a return/exchange with the company today which was very reasonable ($10 fee for shipping the new one) and I've since decided it's not worth the risk of a fire.Cusinart, you really need to fix this issue!!!"
2,Lasted year and a half,"This was good while it worked, my only gripe was that it doesn't moderate the heat of the bottom place based on the amount of coffee left, so if you have only a cup or two left, it can taste burnt after awhile.Alas, the whole unit became junk yesterday, it won't come on or stay on to finish brewing. The probably seems to be with the electronic circuitry that keeps the coffee warm. Its kicking in early."
2,Did not like the taste of the coffee,"I did not like the flavor of the coffee this coffee maker made. It was odd tasting, somewhat bitter and just old. My coffee was fresh, I had just ground it.I was not please with this product at all."
3,"Taste doesn't compare with Krups, Braun or Gevalia","Just bought the DCC 1200 Brew Central, it doesn't meet my expectations. The brewed coffee doesn't come close to the taste of my old Krups, Braun and Gevalia Coffee machines. It is somewhat flat without aroma. It reminds me a lot of the 'basket filter' machines that are a lot cheaper. I am disappointed, expected much more from Cuisinart. Also, the programming doesn't seem to work, I will probably take it back to the store. The control of the 'hot temperature feature' is way overstated. It's hot, but not any hotter than my old machines. The coffee is supposed to be so hot that one can add milk or creamer and still have a cup of hot coffee, not so. Hard to determine the water level in the water reservoir, not visible on the outside. Too bad.....Here is an update: I improved the taste of the coffee by removing the water filter, also got the programming to work........now I'm trying to get used to the coffee."
1,don't buy,My mother and I both bought one of these. She bought hers first and the coffee she brewed was very good. It was also the hottest coffee I've ever tasted from a home brewer! Very fresh and it never tasted burned. I bought one after she did. Hers just stopped working one day. It worked for over a year--mine followed suit. It just stopped working. The coffee pot it just too expensive a machine to continue to replace! What a shame. The coffee itself was great!
3,Great until it broke before 1 year,"Purchased for Christmas 2010 and by November 2011 without everyday/every month use, this coffee maker will not brew or get hot. Warranty is 3 years, but beware, you have to pay to ship this large item ($15+) and have to pay Cuisinart to ship one back to you $10. I know $25 is less than buying a new one, but it cost me time and extra money. Otherwise unit is nice looking and brews great tasting coffee."
2,Excellent for about a year,Coffee pot worked great for about a year. now is shuts off by itself during the brew process. Disappointed with it and not sure which brand to buy next. thought this was the BEST!!!
3,Good machine while it lasts...,"When I bought this coffee maker I thought it would last for a long time. But, the life was very disappointing, lasted just over a year. One day it shut off and started smoking out the back. Looks like the burner element was the culprit. I have read other reviews and this seems to be a problem for some.Before this I had a Miletta and it lasted over 4 years. I bought the Cuisinart for it's good looks and brand name. I am going back to the Miletta this time. If you don't mind replacing your coffee maker every year, this is a sharp looking machine and makes a flavorful hot pot of coffee."
3,Tired of things made in China,Thought that I was buying something that was NOT made in CHINA. I am so dissapointed in Amazon. They have a good thing going but are too scared to but on the description of the product of where it is made.
5,Happy,"I had a typical, old Mr. Coffee for years. It finally died. At work we have one of the new single cup fashionable coffee makers. That isn't what I wanted for home. I like to have a pot of coffee for guests, etc. This got great ratings. I love being able to program it to have my coffee ready for me in the morning. I love the gold filter and how it makes my coffee taste. I'm a New Orleans girl. We like our strong coffee. I'm very happy with the size and shape of this coffee maker, too. It looks really nice in my kitchen. The decanter pours well and fits snugly in the housing. I'm happy and hope to use this one for many years."
3,It was great...for 1 1/2 years,"I really liked this while it lasted. I bought it in Nov 2010. Today (25Jul2012) it stopped working completely. There was no scaling or clogging issues. I kept the charcoal filter changed regularly.After removing the base plate, verifying that the inlet hoses were clean, and that all electrical connections were without issue...the only thing left would be a controller on the circuit board. I removed the circuit board and at least verified that all connections looked good/solid, no problems. So, one of the controller/modules must be defective.It's too bad, I really liked this coffee maker and have had no problems until it simply stopped working today. I'm now a bit wary of buying another Cuisinart product. I don't say that about Cuisinart specifically as it was a well-made product. However, I do question the electrical components they used, which is of course from some other supplier."
2,Great coffee maker - limited lifespan,"I bought this coffee maker in February of 2007 from Amazon.com. Worked fine, until it didn't. Now conveniently (for Cuisinart) outside of the limited 3 year warranty, the coffee maker just plain stopped working two days ago. I called Cuisinart customer service and they gave me some troubleshooting options (run half water, half vinegar through, etc., etc.), none of which worked because the darn machine wouldn't even turn on. I called again today and basically got the brush-off. I'm outside the warranty-there's nothing they can do. I'll be taking my business to another, more reliable brand from now on. In my humble opinion, coffee makers should last more than 5 years."
1,Dead after 1.5 years,Died ... just died .... no clock no lights. dead. Paid alomost $100 and since i dont have the the *&%$ receipt i'm screwed so says the Cuisinart rep. DISAPPOINTED! More trash for the landfill i guess.
1,Leaks Water,I am extremely happy with the looks and the quality of coffee it makes. However the pot leaks and I cannot find out where the water is coming from. I hope to get an answer from the factory customer service. I just haven't taken the time to call.
3,plastic smell and moisture problem,"I ran two carafes of water through the system; and they both smell like plastic. This can't be good. Plus, moisture gathers on the front and under the lid, which is a problem in tropical weather where mold grows easily. I'm thinking of going back to my Farberware percolator even if there are grounds in my cup. Grounds in the coffee cup vs. residual plastic in our systems . Maybe the CDC or the FDA should weigh in on this."
1,"Cuisinart DCC-1200, fairly typical for Cuisinart","Our Cuisinart DCC-1200 lasted less that 2 years. Like many Cuisinart products, it's pretty badly underdesigned. The water load is very narrow and back right--tough for lefties and easy to spill over even for righties. The parts are expensive--especially that charcoal filter you have to replace every 2 months. Don't try brewing without it--even with the filter in place, ONE piece of coffee grounds in the heating plenum below the water tank and you might as well throw it all away. The assembly is done with rivets instead of screws so there is no way to get at the lower plenum to clean it properly--again, fairly typical Cuisinart planned obsolesence design. It's a French hunk of junk if you ask me. My $20 Mr Coffee brewed great coffee for almost 10 years before it died. I'll not buy Cuisinart again."
3,Just finished my second coffeemaker,"I'm looking for a new coffeemaker, as this Cuisinart, my second one, has apparently shorted out. We used it daily for about two years, and I liked its features, but like its predecessor, ZAP and it's done. The first one lasted a shorter period of time, but was replaced by the store where I purchased it. I will not be looking for a Cuisinart brand maker this time."
3,Kaput after a year.,"Just like many others have written, our coffeemaker stopped working just after a year A bad electrical and plastic odor and the light went out...goner. It seems it should last longer, however I haven't come across a coffeemaker that has lasted more than 3 years. We are going for the replacement, hopefully it won't blow up on us. It costs $10 to get a new one shipped and then you have to ship the old one back which is another $18 for us on the east coast. However, at $28 it seems cheaper than buyer a new one. When the coffeemaker was working, we loved it. Fairly quick, good tasting, hot cup of coffee and no prior issues except the brew pause never worked right. Would have given 5 stars if it lasted longer, 3 seems fair."
3,"One year later, it stops working","All of the sudden after about a year and a half the coffee maker will turn on but it won't brew. It has been a great coffee pot so I can't give it a bad rating, but I wished that it had lasted 5-10 years instead of 1-2."
4,good coffee,I am happy with the brewer and the coffee it makes. The reusable filter is better than most and brewing time is very fast. The only criticism I have is that the black lettering on the red of the coffeemaker is difficult to read.
1,It caught on fire!,"My Cuisanart DCC-1200 caught on fire this morning. After doing some research, I came across this consumer affairs site: [...]l. It has hundreds of similar complaints!"
1,Worst machine I've owned,"In reading the positive reviews from other owners, I had to double-check to ensure that I owned the same model that they do. This machine spills coffee grounds and coffee everywhere during the brewing process. My wife and I have tried different grind settings, cleaned out the basket and pot lids, and every other thing a reasonable person would consider. Despite all efforts, the flow of coffee during the brewing process completely overlaps the basket and spills all over the place."
2,"Dead in a year, not real well designed either.","It quit working right at a year. It went dead suddenly and completely. All the lights work, but no heat. It was an ok unit for the time it worked. The clock is LCD which made it hard to read, LED would be a big improvement. All the lettering on the front is kind of small. The water fill was awkward and messy. Plus when you screw up filling the water or coffee grounds it is stupid hard to clean out the reservoir.It makes good tasting coffee and the amount of time it takes to brew is adequate. I won't be buying another one."
1,Consistent in that they die within a year.,"Parents had one; brother had one, so I got one too. After about 6 months, the thing would not cycle water through. I clean it thoroughly, replace filter, try to cycle vinegar through it... nothing. Useless except for the carafe.Last November, I buy another, thinking the first was a fluke--an outlier. For ten months I keep this thing in impeccable shape, cleaning it regularly for fear the last one was my fault. Nope! This week I realize the product simply cannot stand up to a reasonable amount of use. I get the same problem, the water you put in simply will not cycle through. Again, useless. Any attempt to take the thing apart at the in take results in breaking the plastic connections. $60 and now $80 is just way too much for this, what amounts to a very cheap product."
4,I like it,"Pros: Looks great, makes good coffee, you can adjust the temperature of the plate, programmable, relatively sturdy pot.Cons: This is minor, BUT the machine is tall and when you open the lid, you really can't do it under standard overhead cabinets. So, filling the machine with water is a little difficult with a large pitcher or the pot. There is condensation left inside the maker for a long time after the coffee is made. Both of these situations can be fixed quickly with a towel.Overall: I'd buy it again and have recommended it to friends, because the cons are so minor. Compared to our last coffee pot (the Hamilton Beach one where there's no pot, you just stick your cup under), this is so much easier to clean and looks a lot nicer. Not to mention much better tasting coffee!"
1,CLOGS and LEAKS: terrible design,"I'm amazed at all the good reviews for this product. It looks great, and the settings are fun. But.Two really annoying design flaws:1) A lot of coffee grounds circulate throughout the mechanism after each brew, so after several uses it begins to clog and make coffee very slowly, finally clogging altogether. So every week or two you have to do a system clean with vinegar or you won't get your coffee brewed at all.2) It leaks water out the bottom of the mechanism as it brews. I kept wondering why my counter was wet every morning and finally realized water was welling under the thing every time it brewed and spreading over the counter.Unless you enjoy maintaining your stupid coffee maker on a regular basis and cleaning up puddles after every use, avoid the Cuisinart, it's a lemon!"
3,Would have been five star if it has lasted longer,"I would have given this five stars if they lasted more than a year. Looks nice enough, but definitely customer grade with respect to longevity. The first one we bought died just shy of a year, running only and one pot a day (4 to 6 cups). The replacement we got just died, about a year later."
4,Nice features,Makes good coffee.Several nice features including adjustments for heat settings for made coffee and also how long to keep heating plate on before shutting off automatically.The coffee lid is annoying to lift off as it comes off completely to add water.Also note that the heating plate shutoff time is factory set at zero and must be adjusted before its first use.Overall a good coffee maker and looks good w the stainless.
4,"Not perfect, but still worth it!","This is a sturdy, good looking coffee pot that does indeed make tasty, hot coffee. I like the modern/yet retro look, and based on my experience with several Cuisinart products (breadmaker, food processor, toaster oven, ice cream maker and stick blender), I am confident that it will last a long time, and that if I do have a problem, their customer service department will take care it. My only issue, like others have commented on, is that the water resevoir is a bit problematic. I am on the short side, so peering into the resevoir and trying to pour in the right amount of water can be tricky,especially when brewing only 4 cups; It's hard to see the indicator inside the resevoir. Other than that, I have no complaints, especially condsidering the great price on Amazon plus the $10 rebate. Bottom line, very nice coffee pot at a budget price."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200BW,"The electrical cord is very short, very little room to move this coffee maker around on counter top. Mine sits under cabinets and there is no room to fill it without unplugging it every time."
5,works great,the timer is a little difficult to set but the pot works great. I like how you can adjust the shut off
4,Slow Brew,"I bought this coffeemaker two years ago at Costco. I ordered several years worth of coffee filters later from Amazon (they don't seem to make any difference in the flavor). I like the coffee but the brewing is slow. As a mitigation I use the programmable timer to start the coffeemaker 20 minutes before we get up. 20 minutes seems to be an awful long time to brew 12 cups of coffee and it has been that slow almost since the beginning. I cleaned it once with vinegar but there was no difference in the brewing time. It is difficult to fill the tank and unless I pour slowly and carefully I often end up with a puddle on the counter. I like the removable tanks that you can fill directly from the tap better as a design. Our carafe just fractured and I debated whether to spring for a newer machine or just replace the carafe on this one. I hated to throw out all that plastic, so I bought the new carafe."
2,Gosh I wish Braun still made a 12 cup!,"Lived w/ the Cuisinart for about 6 mos now and yes, it makes a good cup of coffee but the ergonomics could not be much worse.Basket is a bear to retrieve, unit has to be pulled out from the wall about 6 inches to access and make coffee. Water target is very small and carafe leaks all over the place if you try to pour too fast (cover on or off). Cover does not seat well on carafe. Tedious and frustrating every time I make coffee.We had a Braun 12 cup for about 6 years and it had none of these issues. I just love when companies un-invent what worked and what was Braun thinking when they discontinued the 12 cup? Not much to choose from here so for coffee quality, this one gets the two stars but everything else is about a zero."
3,Follows a rich tradition of coffeemakers that spill all over the damn place,... when you pour a cup of coffee.If some think-tank comes up with a coffee pot that does not spill they shall make more money than the entire first world GDP.
2,Not For the Drowsy,"This coffee maker is attractive and can make good coffee. Unfortunately, because the interior walls surrounding the heater plate are the precise, dark brown color of coffee, from my angle the carafe always looks empty when it's in the coffee maker. If you're not clear-headed enough to remove and check the carafe every time you make coffee, you'll have messy overflows and ruined pots of coffee."
1,worst coffee maker I've ever owned,"This has to be the worst coffee maker on the market for the money. It does not make HOT coffee, it is impossible to fill, it weighs 10lbs, it pours so slow,it takes 5min to fill a mug. I cannot think of one good thing about it. I would have returned it but shipping is too expensive. I hope anyone thinking of purchasing this pot will read this and think twice. And you cannot program it. It makes a pot of coffe and shuts off,period."
2,"good coffee, bad service","I was happy with the coffee maker until 3mos from the date of purchase it stopped brewing coffee. When I reviewed the warranty info in the manual, I was not happy. After paying $100 for the machine (which I thought was a lot for a ""coffeemaker""), the manufacturer wants me to pay for shipping the defective product back and I am also responsible for a $10 fee as well. I opened a service order with the manufacturer and they clearly gave me instructions to return defective unit with payment or I could pay with a CC over the phone - I told the rep I would call back the next day with CC#. Without payment or defective unit they sent me the replacement machine. Some may think I am foolish for not keeping the machine, however, I called them back and asked why they shipped when I did not call back all they said was that they would authorize pickup of the unit. I am waiting for UPS to pick up now. I will think twice before purchasing any Cuisinart product in the future."
5,Good Product Worth Considering,"Excellent. Works the way it's advertised. I use features that I didn't anticipate using, such as the 1-4 cup setting that allows proper brewing of small amounts. It would be good to have an external indicator for water filling, but it's a small thing."
5,Does what it says it will do.,"Having been a manufacturer's representative for small electrics, I can honestly say that Cuisinart is the best manufufacturer on the market. I just replaced my toaster and coffee maker and am thrilled with each. Attractive, easy to use and very well thought out."
2,Warm Coffee,"I have been using this coffee maker for 3 weeks now, it makes a good cup of coffee , but it only makes warm coffee ! The ads for this coffee maker say that it makes piping hot coffee. The adjustable heating plate and the 1-4 cup setting do not make any difference in coffee temp.I think these settings are just a marketing gimick!If you want hot coffee , try a different coffee maker."
4,"Had it for 2.5 yrs, malfunctioned, replaced under warranty.","We bought this coffeemaker for our 20th anniversary. We loved it right from the start. The pot does not drip when you pour! The timer is nice for that morning coffee. The adjustable warmer is helpful and the permanent gold filter is great. Like the water filter and adjustable brew size. The water level is hard to read being inside the machine, but we use the carafe anyway.After 2 1/2 years, the switch is working intermittently. Called Cuisinart and they sent a new one. Love the service.Would recommend to anyone."
2,"Quality control, anyone?","Although this machine makes terrific coffee if you change the filter regularly, and I like the looks, it began acting up about 6 months after I bought it. Ever since that time, it turns off the heating element at random times, even though it is set to remain on for 2 hours after brewing a pot of coffee. Now I can never be sure to get a hot cup of coffee, which is sort of the whole point behind a coffee maker..."
3,it.s ok,"it.s ok ,just not as good as the same motel it replaced. It does not always shut off after 2 hours and the clock has so much moisture in it you can't see the time."
3,Attractive but rather ordinary for the money.,I bought this to replace a $20 Black and Decker Smartbrew coffee maker that had worked great for three years but I felt like an upgrade. The Cuisinart looks great but beyond that doesn't really do much more than my old machine. To fill the water reservoir requires a very steady hand as the opening is small. There is no back-lighting on the clock which makes it all but useless except for programming the coffeemaker which is not particularly straight forward either. I would also like to see a brew strength control. It makes a decent cup of coffee in the end but I'm not sure it's any better than my old $20 machine.
5,About 2 years and no problems,"Bought from Amazon approximately 2 years ago and couldn't be be happier. No malfunctions. The pot doesn't dribble unless I get really impatient and try to rush the pour. I very much like the hot-plate temperature control, on low it keeps the temp at a tolerable level for my wimpy palate. Easy, straight-forward controls for ""auto"". Not sure if the ""1-4 cup"" setting makes a difference at all. And the ""charcoal filter"" seems gimmicky, but it just sets there ignored. It's been a top model in Consumer Rpts magazine with it's picture on the article's lead page.Overall: Excellent, dependable, functional, customizable machine that I would replace with the exact same model immediately!"
4,cusinart dcc-1200bw coffeemaker,"I have only had this coffeemaker for 3 weeks, but am very pleased with my amazon purchase. I purchased the coffemaker based on consumer report's high rating and customer reviews. I would have liked to have the clock in a blue light background, but like the alarm to let you know when the brewing is complete. The coffemaker is stylish and fairly easy to use, the decanter is especially well designed for pouring without making a mess. I would recommend this coffemaker as the amazon price with rebate was a little over half the retail price of $100.The all black is very stylish and looks good."
1,good customer service,"I have been happy with my coffee maker until this week. I only use the product for a couple of hours each day. However, after just 15 months, it has burned out. I know products are not planned to last as long as they used to but it seems like it should have lasted at least two years or more. However, the company has offered to replace the coffee maker. It is inconvenient and is costing me $ for shipping and handling but I appreciate the good customer service."
2,Disappointed,"Great looking but the water does NOT get hot enough. Max temp is about 160 degrees and does not brew a decent cup for my money. I find it clumsy to use, hate the way the carafe lid snaps on (don't get pinched!) and just try gazing into the water well to determine how many cups of water you just poured in. I am searching online reviews to replace it. My 7 years old Krups Krystal Arome still seems to work better. Oh yeah, if you are brewing 4 cups or less, be sure to tamp down the grinds or it will not brew properly at all, kinda splatters the grinds around and coffee turns out weak (even using the small batch selector feature!!)."
2,"Expensive, Average, Defective!","I had my DC-1200BW for about 4 months before it stopped operating. The water wouldn't make it to the top of the dispensing unit, so it would just steam away inside the heating element without dripping down onto the grounds. I assume something got stuck in the hose (or the hose broke), but I kept the device clean and only used it for 2 pots a week. There isn't anything user servicable inside of the unit so I'm pretty much stuck with it.The coffee quality was alright. I was not blown away when it was working, and the carbon filter thing really didn't make any taste difference. My traditional french press definitely made superior coffee. This is with premium, home-ground beans from Peets or Starbucks.I have had great luck with Cuisinart products in the past but this one was expensive and eventually defective.I ended up going to Target and buying a cheap-o $20 Mr. Coffee as a replacement and the quality of the brewed coffee is about the same."
1,Dangerous!,"This was our second unit and we had been very happy with them. Suddenly, our 6 month old unit suddenly started smoking very badly and the base caught on fire. Luckily, my wife and I were present when this happened and were able to unplug and remove it from the house. We always use the programmable feature so that the coffee is ready when we awake. Had this occurred while we were sleeping... who knows. While searching for a replacement, I found many other reviews describing the same problem with this item."
2,1 year 14 days.. brokenn,"After 1 year and 14 days, this mornig i noticed coffee was boiling and some smog was coming fron the cable under the base. I'm disappointed, was not as good as the company said it'is"
1,Short Life,"Worked great at first, but after a couple of years it's electronics started to fail, finally giving out after three years. Not a coffee maker for the long haul."
1,piece of junk,Do not buy this piece of junk unless you prefer buying a new coffeemaker every 3 years. As soon as ours was past the 3 year warranty the warmer stopped working. Many times it shut off completely in mid-brew. Our kids bought one also and theirs stop working completely as soon as their warranty period was up. It made good coffee when it worked but it should be recalled for defective components.
3,Laid down dead...,"This is the second Cuisinart coffee maker I have owned. The first one (with a 'brewed coffee reservoir') just stopped working one day. But I had liked it, and my sister gave me one of these for Christmas, 2010. Yesterday it just stopped working. The clock on the front still works. The ""I'm brewing"" light still lights up when I flip the switch. Nothing happens.I was very happy with it as a working coffee maker. I'm not so happy with the aesthetics that I want it on my counter if it won't yield coffee. We'll see if Cuisinart makes good on the 3 year warranty."
5,Fantastic,This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned- no filters needed and you don't spill water on the counter! Easy to program- it's a peach! AND it turns off after 4 hour or sooner (depending on what you desire.) My past ones only stayed on for 2 hours- I love it!
4,"Great Coffee Maker, but...","I ordered this coffee maker based on reviews from Amazon and other sources. The machine looks great in my kitchen and makes probably the best tasting coffee that I have ever had (I drink a lot of coffee). The only downside I can report on is that the coffee maker's LCD clock needs a backlight. The display is small and hard to read in all but the brightest light. Plus, the caraffe automatically goes off after two hours which can be annoying. There is a beep tone to warn you, but resetting the blasted thing is an irritation. Other than that, I would buy another as I am pleased with my purchase."
4,great coffee maker,"We bought this one after our last one died in less than a year of daily use (GE brand). I like the options of setting the carafe heat and also how long it stays on. It brews a great cup of coffee, the water filter is very easy to access and replace. The carafe seems very sturdy and functional. I have no problems with this machine. The buttons are very user friendly and I don't have to look at the manual every time I need to reset the automatic timer or the clock. I wish the digital display was a little easier to read (maybe lit up better)but other than that I have no complaints. I also like the 1-4 cup option when I do not need a full pot of coffee."
4,Keeps coffee really hot!,"This is my first Cuisinart appliance and I know of their good reputation. I found on receiving the package; the instructions are easy to follow. Setting the clock was easy; and it does make great coffee. I have found many of the coffee makers I have had through the years didn't keep the coffee hot enough, well for me. This one does! Also has an automatic shut-off. I recommend this product.D. ThomasNashua, NH"
1,Short lived despite its good looks,"The Cuisinart DCC1200 is just too unreliable. While it looks nice and makes great coffee when it is functioning correctly, it doesn't last long. I've had two of these machines stop working. There is a flaw that Cuisinart needs to address. My last one went into self-clean mode every time I made a pot of coffee. The coffee was terrible because half the water had evaporated away before brewing, so the coffee was like mud."
1,3 months old and broken already!!,"I have had mine for just 3 months and it is now broken - - it starts sputtering and steaming halfway through the brew process - - takes a long time to brew -- We really liked the coffee maker - so we were very disappointed when this started happening last week - - the nearly 10 minutes of hot steam blowing from the top practically ruined my kitchen cabinet last week - - now I'm stuck calling cuisinart to try to get it fixed/replaced - - wish I would have bought it locally at the store, in which case I could just return it! not happy at all!"
2,Good while it lasted,"This seemed like a nice machine when I bought it 23 months ago. Unfortunately it started to die a few months ago. It started not heating coffee properly, then it finally stopped brewing altogether about a week ago. This was surprising since my super-cheap Mr. Coffee machine lasted 15 years. I was disappointed that the more expensive Cuisinart model didn't even last two years."
1,Defective toggle switch,"This is a great coffee pot, except for one problem. It doesn't stay on. The on-off toggle switch is cool-looking but it tends to switch itself off after a while. At first this happened sporadically, but now after over a year, it's almost impossible to switch it on at all since it goes off as soon as you release the toggle switch. I called Cuisinart and they told me that there is another model of the DCC-1200 with a button and that the toggle-switch model is only available through club stores, but the toggle-switch version is the model Amazon has on its web site. I would strongly advise anyone wanting to keep this pot for more than a month to look for the other model with a button but I can't find it anywhere on the web.Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed Metal"
5,Great product,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It was more expensive than what he usually gets but his was shot and we will see if this last longer. So far we have no complaints.
2,Not so Hot a Maker,A guy's opinion. Needed a new coffee maker so I spent a few extra bucks and shouldn't have. Makes coffee like any other maker but has some shortcomings. 1. It's to damn tall and since to add water the top flips up it needs a high clearence on the counter. 2. The opening to add water is to small so you better have good aim or a paper towel in hand for the clean up. 3. The clock display is small and you must bend over to read it. 4. The warmer adjustment wasn't very effective since the plate was so warm it burnt the coffee. Not worth the extra bucks.
3,does not meet expectations,"I expected better from Cuisinart. Coffee is excellent, but product is not friendly.The clock/digital display is small and/or unreadable.It is next to impossible to pour water into the machine. I have to stand on tiptoe and cannot see where I am pouring. So I use a small funnel to give a wider mouth for pouring. There is no water level indicator, so I must use the machine's carafe to know how many cups I am making or not overfill the resevoir. The carafe's lid snaps on and does not easity fall into cups, but it has an especially annoying snap release on the handle.Again, the coffee is ok, and the style is great, but I cannot recommend this product."
4,good coffemaker overall,i agree with the waterfill indicator...at first i thought how the heck do i know when i get to the desired cups that i want?? now i have learned to fill the pot and pour in there....other than that it is a good coffemaker ..i have had this one for about one year now...so let's see how long it lasts...my old one lasted 5 yrs:))
2,Disappointed,"After buying cheaper coffeemakers over the years that never lasted very long, I decided to try this one from Cuisinart. It worked great for a while but within a year it quit working. I was extremely disappointed because I really loved it. It brewed great coffee, you can set it to shut off at 2 or 4 hours, and set the temp of the plate that the carafe sets on. It's very attractive but didn't last any longer then the cheaper coffeemakers I've bought in the past. Now I'm searching for a new coffeemaker but won't buy another one like this. I really thought I had found a keeper but didn't."
1,Disappointed...,"This coffee maker lasted 10 mos. It died with no warning. It made hot coffee but after an hour it didn't stay that hot! I have since purchased a Hamilton Beach Brew Station which is FABULOUS! Hot, hot coffee even after 4 hrs of sitting in the machine with no burnt taste! It's a prettier machine too! Stay away from the Cuisinart!!"
4,Carafe lid and water compartment quirks,"I figured out how to take the lid off easily by pushing the lid forward and holding the front of the lid by the spout and slightly lifting at the same time. It works for me everytime. The coffee maker stands fairly tall so I have to slide it out from under the top cabinet to fill with water however I had to do that with my previous Melitta. It is easy to set for next morning start up, even my husband can do it. I think it's just getting use to a little different way of doing the same process on a different product.This coffeemaker does indeed make wonderful coffee, keeps it hot for 1-3 hours and shuts off. I would recommend it if you're needing to replace. I thought it was worth the extra $ if it performs long term. Only had it a month, I still have the box in case it fouls too soon. I believe it has a 3 yr warranty. It's made in China (arggh)I try to by USA, but sometimes it' very difficult. Perhaps this product will not leave a bad taste."
4,Cuisinart coffee maker,We received this as a house warming present. I loved the stylish look and stainless steel. The crafe is easy to pour from.We have had this coffee maker for 4 years and has no stopped working. It brews great coffee and I like the 1-4 cup selection for that occasional afternoon cup. Now I am going to get another one.
1,Dead at only 1.5 years,"When I bought this in 2010, I figured I would buy a quality machine we could have for the next 10 years or so. It made great coffee and had nice features, but obviously not made to the high quality the price would indicate.In the past few weeks, the machine has been shutting down well before the autoshutdown time should have been. This morning it started giving off that awful burnt electronics smell and it appears the machine is now dead. I don't think 1.5 years is an acceptable time frame for a machine of this cost. Stay away from Cuisinart if you are looking for something to last awhile."
3,Not the same brushed Stainless Steel as my old one,"I just had to replace my coffee maker (same model) after 7 years. I think calcium build-up killed it (no longer pumped water efficiently). Maybe because I did not use the charcoal filter. I just got a new one, in what I thought was the same color/finish. Seems like Cuisinart is cutting costs- the finish is plastic, and used to be real stainless steel. I hope they have not skimped on other internal parts."
1,Not very reliable,"I purchased the first one of the DCC-1200 coffeemaker about 3 years ago. This pot lasted about 2 years, which I thought was acceptable since we always have a pot of coffee going at our house. When it finally died, I bought another one, but after about 7 months, the hot plate burned out. I contacted Cuisinart Customer Service and they sent me a new pot under the warranty. Now after about 7 months again, the replacement pot is not working properly. It shuts itself off mysteriously anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours later. Sometimes it doesn't even finish the brew cycle before it shuts itself off.I contacted customer service but they said they can only do a warranty replacement one time. She suggested that I unplug the pot for 5 minutes to see if the timer would reset. I did this and now it's worse than ever. I'm now on a search for a more reliable coffee maker."
2,Limited warmer time - not for all-day coffee drinkers,"This product may make great coffee but the auto shutoff feature limits the warmer to 4 hours of operation per brew, making it useless for all-day coffee drinkers. Basic programming and use features are OK. Coffee maker is tall which makes use under most kitchen cabinets difficult. Opening for pouring water in smaller than most."
3,Coffee lovers of America,"I was looking for a coffeepot that brewed really hot coffee-as in heat hot. This is a great coffeemaker, but hotter than usual coffee-no it is not that-makes the average heated cup of a cheaper Mr. Coffee or numerous others. Will not make this purchase again. It is a nice pot with some great features, but the heat temp. which can be adjusted cannot be hot enough for my taste."
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker,I received the Cuisinart DCC-1200 12 cup Coffeemaker for Christmas this year. I absolutely love it. The coffee tastes so much better with this coffeemaker which has the water filter. I really like the looks of this coffeemaker also - very modern. This is a very sturdy and well made coffeemaker. I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone who loves a good cup of coffee.
3,Both good and bad,"We liked the features and the taste of the coffee in this coffee maker but as others have noted, the water is hard to fill. After about a 1 1/2 years or so, it is now dead. The water is boiling but the system is clogged so it will not go to the top. I tried cleaning it out and got quite a lot of gunk out of it but was unable to unclog it (even with compressed air). I suspect it is because the coffee grounds splash over the top and into the reservoir. I will look for a different one and will not buy this one again."
3,Ok coffee brewer with a few questionable design issues,No diatribe...just direct pros and cons.ProsIt looks good.Controls are fairly simple to use.ConsIt is taller than I'd like so finding a place for it is an issue.It has a very small opening into which you pour the water.The clock on it is so small and poorly designed that it is unusable as a clock from more than a couple feet away.The carafe lid is a snap-on type that is poorly designed.For an expensive drip coffee machine I was disappointed with some design choices. I'd say the designers are not coffee drinkers. It isn't an awful machine. I'd give the form a 4 and the function a 3.
1,Don't Buy this Coffee Maker,"I had this machine for approximately 6 months. I liked it a lot at first, BUT...it suddenly stopped brewing. I routinely cleaned it following their suggested cleaning methods and I regularly changed those expensive filters too. I called customer service to get some suggestions and they said, ""...unplug it and let the water/vinegar mixture soak in the reservoir for 1 hour. Then plug back in"".Nothing happened, lights come on, clock is on but it will not brew. So frustrating and such a waste of money! I cannot wait to find a decent coffee maker that can at least give us 12 full months of usage without breaking."
1,Stopped Brewing Coffee after 10 months.,"Exactly 10 months to the day it stopped brewing coffee. No signs that the machine was having trouble. Tuesday it brewed normally, Wednesday it stopped working. I am going to try and get a repair/replacement from warranty (3 years)."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200BW,"Length:: 3:02 MinsCuisinart DCC-1200: Makes great coffee, owned 10 months w/no problems. Few drawbacks that the manufacturer could (should) improve on to make it a 5 star machine.Update 11/3/11: Spoke too soon about no problems! It fail to auto brew this am & all atempts to brew or self-clean failed. Suspect the heating element failed. shipped back to Cuisinart for repair/replacement. Down grade it a 3 star."
2,Finish is not as it appears,"This is our 3rd unit. Live in an area that has tough water. So my review is not about it's performance. That we can contest to is tremendious! My concern is that the newest finish is not real brushed metal. It is plastic made to attempt the look of brushed metal. We have an older version of this and it was as it described. It is no longer the case. Beware of the finish.The ""Black Crome"" may be a better choice as it is not attempting to be what it is not. We had this unit prior to this one and I wish that I had purchased this one again. That assumes that finish has not changed for the favor of improved profits as I am certain was the motivation. Don't get me wrong, all in favor of profits! Just not misrepresentation. Brushed metal is not as it describes."
2,lasted 13 months,"Very disapoointed. Coffee maker just stopped brewing this morning. bummer! Cleaned it as they suggested when I called manufacturer. Then cleaned it again. Won't work, won't brew, and now I must get another coffee maker. Wish I had gotten it at Walmart and could take it back there and pick up another one today. How long do I need to be without until I get another one? Not good."
3,Shipping Not Included in Warranty if you have a problem,"The coffee maker is really nice, as long as it works. We purchased ours from a store. Within 2 months, the coffee maker began shutting off shortly after the brewing process was done, even though it was set to stay on for 2 hours to keep the coffee warm. We contacted Cuisinart about the problem via email and a couple days later they told us to do a decalcification of the coffee maker. We did, but it had no effect. We emailed Cuisinart again and they responded that they would replace the coffee maker, but we had to pay $10.00 s&h for them to ship the replacement to us and also we'd have to pay the s&h to return the defective coffee maker. Needless to say, we took it back to the store that we bought it from. We've owned Cuisinart coffee makers in the past and the lasted for years. Was very disappointed the Cuisinart doesn't cover shipping and handling as part of the warranty."
3,coffee maker quit,"We have had this coffee maker for exactly 1 year & really have liked it. We like the temperature adjustable warming plate. It brews good coffee. No complaints at all with the product UNTIL NOW. One morning this week it just plain did not work. The man at Customer Service at Cuisinart directed us to beef up the vinegar in the vinegar/water mix and try decalcifying. It still did not work. No noise, no brewing, nothing. So, we were directed to ship it back & enclose $10 to cover the shipping cost for the one they are sending to us. Well, it cost over $20 to ship our broken one back! This is a $30 cost to replace a $66 coffee maker under the warranty! We'll withhold final opinions on this coffeemaker until after we have had the replacement for at least a year. The product is too expensive to break down so soon."
2,Piece of trash,"Coffeemaker worked OK for only 10 months before frying itself, producing a strong smell of burning plastic and ceasing to turn on. I owned a similar Cuisinart coffeemaker before (a DCC-1150) that also failed after a year, or so, but I hoped it was an exception. In that case I did a postmortem and found that the circuit board was poorly designed and much more poorly constructed... the sort of soldering that might expect from middle-school students. I won't bother to waste my time looking at this one. Will I ever buy another Cuisinart electrical appliance? Not likely. Don't waste your money, either."
3,Great maker lasted 1.5 years,Love the coffee maker but have had it for 17 months and now it won't brew or heat so I'm checking on the 3 yr warranty to see if I'm sol.
3,Great Coffee and and looks nice but may not work long.,"This coffeemaker looks nice and the wife said it makes good coffee. However, I just sent the second unit back for replacement as it quit pumping after two years same as the first unit. Under warrenty but Cuisinart charges you shipping plus a $10.00 fee.I purchased an inexpensive Black & Decker to use as a back up and it has some better features than the DCC-1200. Clock has bigger and brighter numbers and water window view from outside plus wider opening to pour in water for brewing.Both units made in China."
5,Great Machine!,I love this coffee maker. I thought it was too expensive but decided to give it a try. What do I have to lose? This is one of the best coffee makers I have ever had. It is well made and worth every cent.
2,broke after 11 months,"This product worked great and made good coffee while it lasted. But after eleven months of use, one day it started to smell like burnt plastic and never worked again."
5,Great coffee but watch out for under-counter lights,I had used the Bodum French press for years with very mixed results and the DCC-1200 is a giant step up. It looks terrific and quickly makes a large amount of exceptionally delicious coffee. The only drawback is that it is quite a tall unit and lights installed under our top cabinets really heat up its plastic top.
2,Not satisfied,I purchased this a couple years ago. Hot coffee but the machine turns off by itself after 10 minutes. Purchased another one and it did the same thing. I paid $119 each for these back then. I myself am looking at a plain jane BUNN.
2,Makes good coffee but !!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a replacement for the Cuisnart grind and brew. I had problems with the basket getting jammed and it was impossible to remove. Cuisnart replaced the coffee maker and after a few months the same thing. I decided to just get a neww coffee maker and buy a grinder(kitchen aide) which I am very happy with. The coffee pot is another story. I read the reviews and decided to get it even though there were some flaws. It is difficult to put water in without getting water all over the counter. When the lid is opened again water gets all over the counter. the coffee pot does not slide in evenly so care must be taken. Just alot of design flaws. I just visited Lowe's and looked at coffee pots. I was amazed at how well engineered some coffe pots are and priced about the same as the dcc-1200. Wish I would have waited and gone to Lowe's first. If you don't want to be constantly cleaning up, stay away from this one."
1,Piece of junk!,"We had this coffee brewer just over a year when it started not allowing the water to enter the pot, just steamed it away. I tried cleaning every orifice available and removed the charcoal filter and still no coffee would brew. All we got was steam. We only used it occasionally for family parties and such and at this price, it is a shame that it didn't function for very long. I will never buy another cuisinart piece of junk again!"
4,Good Product!!,Coffeemaker performs beautifully and very easy to use. The only drawback is the water-holding tank fill level is hard to read.
2,"Worked well, until it died an untimely death","Nice features, can make coffee about any way you want. Lack of a visible water-level indicator is a bummer.Biggest bummer is that it lasted only about 1.5 years of near-daily use to make the morning coffee. Just died. Flat-lined. Nada. And yes, we changed the filter, use filtered water in it, and performed the other maintenance tasks suggested.Very unsatisfactory performance for price. Seems to be a throw-away item from looking through other reviews and comments."
4,Love My Cuisinart Coffeemaker,I love my new Cuisinart coffeemaker. I especially like the dripless pour spout. My old ones would spill water all over as I filled them. I have never lost a drop with this one plus it keeps the coffee hot!
5,Very practical,"Excellent coffee machine. Has everything you need. auto on/off, 4 cup option, water purifier etc. What I like the most is that maintenance is very easy to keep up with. permanent gold tone filter makes life easy, but you can also put a regular paper filter in too. Plus a auto clean button. The overall appearance is very fancy too. I chose the black chrome which turned out very nice for my room giving a masculine feel."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this coffee maker recently to replace an aging Cuissinart. This new one does not measure up. First, the cone-style basket seems to produce worse tasting coffee than the flat basket style of my previous one. Secondly, adding water to this unit is tricky, small opening with easy splash everywhere. It has been retired to emergency duty!"
5,Great Coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker does everything I expect a coffeemaker to do....brews a good pot of coffee very quickly and keeps it hot until I have finished the whole pot. I have two of these, one at the office and one at home. I am very happy with them both."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200,"This works fine, though I would have preferred a higher temperature. Interior water chamber visibility is very poor, and clock is nearly invisible."
5,ONE OF THE BEST COFFEE MAKERS!,"Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable CoffeemakerI hesitated to buy this because of the problems we have had with other coffee makers where the clock was set above the pot. I ordered this one because it can also do the 1-4 cups too. The Cuisinart name doesn't hurt either. I don't drink coffee, but my husband does by the gallon. HaHa..But this is a great coffee maker. We have had it for 3 weeks now and it is perfect. My husband says the coffee is great and it is fast to make. When you add the water in, there is no spillage like most coffee makers. It came with the gold tone filter, but we still use the paper kind. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone I know. I give it an A++++++"
4,HOT COFFEE,This coffee maker is easy to use. Brews hot coffee and keeps it hot. There is no water marking on the outside which was on my previous Cusinart. That is the only design feature that I feel is lacking in this model.
3,Plastic Not Stainless Steel,I thought that the silver colored portion on this coffee maker was stainless steel but it's plastic. I'll need to do more research to see if a stainless coffee maker is manufactured.
5,Love and 7 years later,"Well, after 7 great years of excellent coffee - she is on her last leg I feel. The maker, as soon as its finished brewing releases some water from the bottom of the maker - think of it as having a little accident. If you look at the bottom of the warmer it has some sort of venting system , it seems to be coming from there. I'll wait another week or so but the water has been leaking a few weeks now. I think I may get one with the coffee grinder built in. I really like the size and function of this model. Best coffee maker ever - this has made coffee for me without issue for 7 years each and every day and them some! I hate to get rid of it. This has been such a great buy!"
2,some bad features and poor performance,"My last 3 coffeemakers have been Cuisinart and this is my last one. Malfunctioned after 13 months, it was a replacement for an original coffeemaker and now they will not honor the 3 year warranty. The small opening for the water is a problem, the water level is very difficult to see and all black makes it difficult to read the clock too. I had a white one before and it stained badly. Don't recommend Cuisinart anymore. Also had two Cuisinart coffee grinders and they both malfunctioned and returned to the store. The store clerk guessed what was wrong before I even told them because they had had so many returns. I have never written a review before but so disappointed in a company that used to make good small appliances."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200 frustration,"Bought the DC-1200 coffee maker 3 plus years ago to coordinate with other kitchen finishes and CR reviews.After 3 years of light use the unit has stopped working.This is wrong.For the price,anyone should expectbetter reliability.My 10 year old Mr. Coffee is back on the counter and is working very well after it's3 year vacation.Price is not always a predicter of quality."
5,Best ever,This is the best coffee maker i have ever owned. It performs and does exactly what they advertised.Best tasting coffee i ever had.This one out performs them all. I highly recommend it.
1,No Warranty!,"I contacted Cuisinart by mail, phone, email several times over a month. They refuse to replace a defective product. Their product warmer turns off immediately after brewing, resulting in a cold 2nd cup of coffee. Cuisinart REFUSED to reply by mail, telephone had me verify warmer time, then refused to replace. Email stone-walled and said I didn't give them the serial number in FIVE emails for which the serial number was included AND the product was registered!!!! Buyer beware! Cuisinart will not warranty products."
1,Not that great - stops working and catches fire,"Had one of these for about a year before it wouldn't turn on. Sent it back to Cuisinart and they replaced it. Had the second one for a few months, then it started doing the same thing. This morning smoke started pouring out the back of the coffeemaker. Right now it's sitting in the back yard, smoldering. Not recommended."
1,plastic tatse,"I had to send it back because the coffee had a plastic tatse and wasn't nearly as good as my old pot. Also the caraff is not hinged, but clicks on and off. This is an inconvience in cleaning the pot for me."
1,Disappointed,"I own a great set of Cuisinart Pots & Pans as well as a food-processor / blender combo all of which I LOVE! So I saw this machine at Costco was excited and bought it on the spot. Talk about disappointment, it takes more grounds than my old Mr.Coffee maker only for the brew / temperature to be much weaker. I get up at 5 in the morning put my workout cloths on and I'm out the door by 5:30, but unfortunately I have to wait as I have to run my coffee through TWICE in order to get a decent dark brew. I will be going back to my $20 Mr.Coffee maker."
1,Never Again,"Researched different coffee makers and decided on the Cuisinart, loved the coffee maker for 3 months, than it died. Never will buy again at least the cheap coffee makers last a year."
2,Cuisinart quality is not what it used to be,"I expected better quality from Cuisinart. It doesn't make coffee any better than our 10 year-old Krups. The ""shower-head"" brewing system doesn't add anything to the process in terms of strength or flavor. You must lift the large cover to add coffee and water so it has to be moved if under or close to a cabinet. Adding water is slightly cumbersome as it's a narrow opening in the rear of the unit. The cover is already squeaking after a week's use. The carafe lid has to be removed in order to add water or clean. It feels cheaply made. We're returning it."
1,"Terrible coffee maker, even worse customer service.","Be prepared to shell out $26 for a new carafe every couple of weeks. I've had 3 shatter in the last 3 months just from normal everyday handling...I did not drop them on the floor or smash them on the countertop. They know about the problem but will do nothing to fix it. Customer service was a joke and extremely unhelpful. So long Cuisinart, you lost a customer for life!"
2,Get Ready For Spills....,"The water reservoir opening on the top of the machine is so narrow it is nearly impossible to pour the water into the top without spilling it over the sides. It is also very difficult to see the ""cup"" markers which are located deep inside the machine to see exactly how much water you have poured in; if you are any shorter than 6 feet it is nearly impossible. There is also an unusually high amount of condensation that forms on the underside of the lid; it will be there the next morning unless you wipe it off promptly. Yeah, this is a ""decent"" coffee maker; and the brew does get nice and hot after sitting on the hot plate for a few minutes. But after cleaning up water spills at 5am in the morning, I regret this purchase."
5,Best coffee maker out there,"I recently bought this despite reader reviews of the coffee not being hot enough. I guess those people have broken models, because mine is very hot. I add an ice cube to my coffee now. My Mr. Coffee was never hot, despite the ability to adjust the warming plate.*The caraffe does not spill, no matter how fast you pour it.*It looks good and is built solid (my mr. coffee rusted though).*It is simple and easy to use.*It has a 3 year warranty, versus one for most others.This coffee pot is worth the extra $50 over cheaper pots.~happy brewing....."
2,you don't always get what you pay for,"I purchased the cuisinart coffee maker for 2 reasons; #1 being the cuisinart name you think of quality. #2 It came in Red (my kitchen is also red) I have already returned one because of problems and now I have a replacement which does make very good coffee.....But..it does leak out the backside when lifting the lid, just as others have complained about. Plus I can't seem to find any replacements for the charcoal water filter insert that goes inside of the water reservoir.Where do I go?And lastly my #1 complaint is that the letters that label the buttons on the front of the coffee maker are coming off!! What next? I paid a lot of money for this and I am not very satisfied. Of course wouldn't you know now Kitchen Aid has a red coffee maker available! I bet it doesn't cost as much as this Cuisinart did!"
2,Not impressed,"I generally like Cuisinart products and my wife and I use a coffee maker at least 1-2 times per day. The problem with the Mr. Coffee products is should you break the glass carafe, it is near impossible to buy a replacement, as the manufacturer stops producing replacements, forcing you to buy a whole new machine! We have never been able to get one to last more than about a year. All of the great reviews for this product notwithstanding, this one too gave up the ghost in months. Although we have soft water, the device needed cleaning with vinegar with increasing frequency, or it would not brew properly and would just spit. Finally nothing seemed to help. Maybe it was a lemon. My search for a reliable machine continues."
5,awesome,"I checked out lot's of coffee pots before buying this one and I couldn't be happier. it works like video described brews quickly, alarms when done etc. pours without spilling doesn't dribble etc. an xlnt product and looks nice price was good with free shpg. also"
2,Very disappointing after all the hype,"After our Braun FlavorSelect, which is not made anymore, died -- sniff -- my husband and I searched for a new coffee maker. This Cuisinart had good reviews overall and was a good price. I could not, however, get the thing to make a good cup of coffee. I tried adjusting the amount of coffee and the fineness of the grind to no avail. The coffee simply had no flavor. It was like, as the French say, ""sock water."" So we returned it and bought an expensive TechniVorm Moccamaster. It is handmade in Europe and man it makes a good cup. I think it is worth the price if you can stomach spending $300 on a machine. Perhaps the Cuisinart didn't have enough wattage to get the water hot enough; perhaps the brew cycle was too long. I don't know. I also found the machine to be rather unwieldy and not well-designed (water reservoir was hard to fill, no external level indicator, etc.)."
1,Caught on fire,"Caught on fire last week! Just glad I was in the kitchen at the time, but still had $500 in damage."
1,DIED ON ME!,"I bought this coffee maker 1-2 years ago spending $80 plus on it and it stopped working this week. It stopped pumping and heating the water though the light will still turn on as if nothing is wrong. I tried using the self clean mechanism which also didn't work. My problem seems to reflect many others who also gave it 1 star. I expected more from this unit for the price. It is waste to have many of these units break after a couple of years - typical problem of American products made cheaply. This is makes two out of two cuisinart purchases break in short amount of time. The smartstick/food processor broke within a few uses, spent $10-20 to replace it only for it to break again. I will not be buying cuisinart products again."
2,Broke down,Worked fine for awhile but recently broke down after about 8 months of daily use. Warranty repair cost about $50 for shipping charges so it's either buy a new one or get this one fixed. Will buy a different brand this time. Not really that impressed with performance.
5,Great Overall Product,"I have had one for 2 years 9 months. It just stop working yesterday. It just would not peculate. It worked as far as the electrical portion but would not do anything. I call Customer Support, tried vinegar and water soak. It would not start to circulate after soaking. Cuisinart is sending me another we just the serial # info. I use a funnel to fill it up and paper filters to catch dust and wipe underside of lid after brewing. Their is not problem that does not have simple remedy."
2,Good product - BAD service,"Worked well for the year we had it, then started to leak water all over the kitchen counter. Not willing to just throw it away, my diy hubby tore it apart (the warranty was up anyhow) and found a split in a hose with a stop valve. Emailed the company to buy the part and was told a week later that ""You have violated the warranty agreement! Try these steps to clean your coffee pot...."" Huh? Return email: Hello? I just need to buy this wee hose; could you tell me where I might buy the hose? We have cleaned it many times incidentally."" Return from Cuisinart: Sorry, we don't sell parts for our coffee pots.So, if you are like us and don't like to throw stuff away because it needs a simple part, then don't buy this one. Won't buy another one."
1,Did not last,Bought it in 2009 and took impeccable care of it. The unit died in early 2012. The unit that this had replaced (a Krups) had lasted about 15 years.
3,seems a little jankie,"I've bought an expensive coffee maker in the past that crapped out after just over two years (outside of warranty of course) I'm really tired of complaining about cheaply made crap that doesn't last, but.... Although I just got it and haven't used it yet, I will be shocked if it makes it more than a year or two. It is very flimsy and feels much cheaper than it is."
3,leaking carafe,"This is the second DCC-1200 I bought. The first gave six years of good and faithful service. I opted to purchase the complete coffee maker in lieu of just buying a replacment carafe. The replacment carafe is half as much in terms of cost as the entire machine. Evidentially there have been some changes to the design of the carafe. I have, on several occasions, had hot coffee dripple from around the spout of the carafe. It seems as though when you try to pour the coffee quickly the coffee somehow dribbles down and outside of of the carafe and onto the cabinet. I have poured the coffee slowly in an attempt to see how the coffee is getting outside and cannot dupilicate the leak. Must be a trick dribble carafe!"
5,best Coffee Pot Ever,I have had every conceivable coffee pot and in my opinion this is the best. It makes an excellent cup of coffee every time.The unit itself is attractive and also the pot is substantial in the hand. Would I buy this again? You bet.
4,"Great Quality, Easy to Use","We replaced a Bodum Santos coffee maker with this one. The Santos made better coffee, but it was a huge pain in the neck to clean and had small parts that broke and were not available. We read the reviews about this coffee maker and the quality is really very good. Cuisinart could have built this crappier but they didn't.It is very easy to use and clean and has all the features that you really need to make coffee at home on a daily basis. We highly recommend it, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that It doesn't make the best coffee I've ever made, but if I want coffee just like The Open Eye Cafe (Carrboro, NC) I go there."
3,"Decent Coffee Maker, but Failed After a Few Years","My wife and I received this coffee maker as a wedding gift five years ago. Our jobs (we work together) take us out of town for a year+ at a time, so really our coffee maker only had about 2-3 years of actual service on it. Anyway, it gave up the ghost a few months ago and it seems to be a common problem with this model judging from our research. I've contacted manufacturers for other items I felt prematurely failed and they typically will send a coupon of sorts for a small discount off the purchase of another of their products. Cuisinart just said sorry 'bout it!Otherwise, it was a good coffee maker while it lived. It was very annoying that all of the condensed water would spill down the back of the coffee maker when the cover was opened - some even speculate of this being the reason this model tends to prematurely fail. The designers obviously were aware of the issue since they designed in a little catch lip, but they just didn't make it big enough."
1,Poorly designed necessitating frequent cleaning,"I have had this coffeemaker for about a year. While the coffeemaker makes good coffee, the design is significantly flawed. The coffee basket and the water tank are adjacent to each other with no separation. As water drips into the coffee basket, it splatters sending coffee grounds into the water. After a few weeks, the water tank has a coating coffee grounds as is the charcoal water filter. As a result every couple of weeks, I hold it upside down over the sink spraying it to rinse out the water tank. I use a bottle brush, too. This gets most of the mess, but not all.Another problem with the design is that LCD display is not lit, making it difficult to read."
5,"Owned for several years, used daily!","I honestly have to say, this coffee maker is very reliable, we brew coffee every morning and leave the warmer on throughout the day, for many years this has worked flawlessly. I will buy another one of these prior to it being discontinued so I can have a fine piece of coffee making equipment for at least the next 10 years."
3,"Great Coffee Maker, But...","We purchased this coffee maker four years ago and it worked perfect every day. Starting a month ago, the coffee maker would begin shutting itself off halfway through the brewing process and we would have to wait 10-15 minutes to turn it back on. Two days ago, it finally died completely. Overall, we were satisfied with the coffee maker, just wish we could have gotten a couple more years out of it."
5,Wonderful Coffee Maker!!!!,We had been looking for a good coffee maker that made HOT coffee and now we have found it in this coffee maker and we really like it. BEST COFFEE MAKER WE HAVE OWNED !!!
2,Stops working,"My first won stopped working after a few months - it would perk, but no water would come out. Got a replacement without much trouble - but now, after less than a year, it doesn't work either - heating element doesn't come on. Would buy it again."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This somewhat expensive coffee maker lasted long enough to get out of warranty. I bought what I thought was quality, but that's not what I got. First, you couldn't turn it on, but could, using the auto mode. Then that quit as well. Nothing to do but throw it away. I thought my experience was unique until I read the reviews on Amazon. Go to the section about how long does it last. You will see what happened to my Cuisinart has happened to many."
1,Burned Up,I had it some 14 months. . . one morning it emitted the smell of burning wiring and now no longer works. It was purchased from Amazon.
3,Cuisinart Coffee Maker,"This machine was easy to set up and use. It is a bit hard to fill, with a small opening for pouring in the water. In addition, there is no indicator on the outside as to how many cups are contained inside...it has marks inside, but they are hard to read."
1,Fire Hazard,"This morning during the brew process this coffee maker, which we ordered from Amazon a year and a half ago, began billowing smoke from the bottom and giving off a sharp burning plastic smell.We have liked the coffee maker very well but this is a clear fire hazard and probably merits a recall by Cuisnart."
1,Almost burned the house down,"We were looking for a coffeemaker that makes a good cup of coffee, and that would be reliable and last us many years. After much research, I settled on this model, and sprang for what I thought was an upscale product. The coffee was good but no better than the last coffeemaker I had that cost half or less. It has a filter that I never could find a replacement for, and I spent alot of time looking.Then came the disaster--it's been out of warranty approximately 1 month (go figure) and this morning, it caught on fire! Luckily my husband was close by, smelled the smoke and his quick action most likely kept it from burning our house down. I shudder to think what would have happened if we had been using it on timer mode.Save your money."
2,Serious flaws keep this machine average,"Cons:- There is no way to conveniently measure how much water one puts in from the outside view. You literally have to stick your head inside the machine and peek down through the well to see the cup markers on the side of the well to see how much water you are putting in.- Takes a lot of ground coffee to make a decent cup. Inefficient.- Way too much plastic inside touches the coffee.- Takes up a lot of counter space.- Even at the lowest setting, the burner is too hot- Last about 2 years before the circuitry conks outPros:- Has an interesting ""1-4"" button that gives the water and extra shot of heat; makes the coffee taste better- If you are willing to waste a lot of coffee at one shot, it will make a few decent cups"
1,Defective or poor design?,"Maybe I bought a defective product and just attributed it to poor design, but every coffee maker I've purchased in the last 20 years has had a stop a serve feature. If I pull the carafe out while it's brewing, the coffee keeps coming. Many times, the coffee pot gets about 1/2 full and seems to stop. If I pull the carafe out, then coffee starts coming out onto the warmer plate full stream. My wife won't ever spend an extra dime, but 4 weeks with this coffee maker and she told me to pitch it and buy a new one."
5,perfect coffee,"We love it! It makes hot, delicious coffee. We have NO problem pouring in the water. Go buy this coffee maker. It looks fabulous, too."
2,Cuisinart grind and brew coffeemaker,We are on our 3rd Cuisinart. After 4 months the water did not drip through often requiring repressing on 2-3 times. At this point the grinder basket does not lift out of the pot. It has to be forced up from underneath. I love this coffee pot and wish the quality was consistent. Cuisinart has not been responsive with complaints.
2,Lacking for the Money.,"Considering the prestiges name of Cuisinart and the cost of the product(even at it's discounted price), it did not meet my expectations. To me it was poorly engineered and not very user friendly:1. It is big and bulky.2. It is awkward to pour the water into it's tank, unless you are a tall person (over 6ft.) or using a stepping stool.3. If you don't have a steady hand, you are sure to spill the water all over the coffee grinds and the filter.4. The coffee maker's clock is hard to read. It is recessed and does not light up. You'll need a magnifying glass if you are over fifty years of age.If I had to buy another coffee maker, the $[money] Mr Coffee will do a better job and make my life easier."
1,"Beware of ""Limited Warranty""","On December 26, 2009 I purchased the DCC-1200 coffeemaker BECAUSE IT WAS A CUISINART PRODUCT AND I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER CUISINART PRODUCTS. On February 8, 2010, the carafe leaked out its full brew of coffee. On examination I saw hairline cracks on the glass below the (I suppose) decorative metal band at the bottom of the glass carafe. I wrote Cuisinart customer service an email explaining the difficulty, but did not recieve a reply. This morning, February 12, I phoned and was told the warranty does not cover glass, so the carafe is not part of the warranty. It would not have occurred to me that any part of the product would be excluded from the warranty. Of course, I was told they would be happy to sell me a replacement. Imagine my gratitude! Cuisinart is now a brand I will avoid."
4,Enjoying the coffee,"We've had this about two months now. Cleaned it once. The coffee tastes great and it takes only a short time to brew. The only hitch is that the place to pur the water in is a bit small, it's in the back right of the unit, so care is needed when pouring in water to avoid a mess. That's a bit of a Catch-22 in that I haven't had my coffee yet when I'm first making the coffee. It's okay, I have a couple dish towels handy. So far I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quality coffee maker. It came with a 3 yr warranty and that was also a factor in purchasing it. Only Bunn had a similar warranty period. I recently saw this very coffee maker very prominently displayed in the kitchen of the Police Commissioner's home in a Blue Bloods episode. That's either paid product placement or we both have great taste in coffee makers."
2,Great for one year,"This is the second coffee maker my roommate and I have burned through. After a year of daily brewing, the auto-on feature has suddenly stopped working. Not sure what the problem is, but when you flip up the switch nothing happens and we wake up to no coffee ready the next morning. Unplugging helps this sometimes, sometimes it doesn't."
1,Cuisinart Coffeemaker failed in less than 3 months,I purchased this item from Amazon (new) Feb. 19 2011---I use the pot everyday-and I depend on the programming in the morning. Today the coffee pot did NOT come on--thinking I made a mistake--I turned on the brew option--the pot turned off with a beep a few mins after the coffee was made--I made another pot and that also beeped and turned off--the heating should stay on for 2 hrs!I am not happy--but the window for return expired March 31-2011!!! Today is May 5!Look to another coffeemaker if you use it everyday and need it more than 2 months
5,Great flavor for coffee,"We could tell an immediate improvement in flavor over our Mr. Coffee unit. I expect that the charcoal filter has something to do with it. My only complaint is that we grind our own coffee and no matter how coarse I grind it(within reason), I always end up with grounds in the bottom of the pot. I am using the gold tone filter.overall easy to use and I do like the three choices of pot warmer temperature, although we like the middle setting and do not change it."
3,An OK coffee pot,"We bought this coffee pot in Sept. 2008. It stopped working completely after 2yr/8mo. It would simply not turn on.Positive features:It brewed a good cup of coffee and stayed hot.I loved the ability to be able to set the auto-shut off for 1-4 hours.I loved the ability to lower the heat for a small amount of coffee so it did not burnFlaws:Pouring into the small well opening required a steady hand (which is sometimes lacking before a first cup of coffee)The line on the dial, indicating brew, clock, auto prog. etc, rubbed off and we had to keep drawing it back on with a sharpie markerThe programmable options started failing about four months ago. The coffee would shut off after one hour instead of four, the auto on feature clock would not set etc.The water filters were very expensive and were difficult to find. We ended up doing without and just using filtered water.I would not buy this coffee pot again."
2,cuisinart DCC-1200BW Brew Central 12 cup,Pros: Hot coffeeCons: lid is not attached to caraffe and comes off when puring coffee. There is not a measure line on the outside of pot for water.
2,Irritating and annoying sound,A warning to dog owners. The beeping sound made by this coffeemaker is similar to that made by the receiver on an Invisible Fence dog collar. This is the sound a dog hears from the collar when approaching the Invisible Fence and which is heard 3 seconds before the receiver on the collar administers a shock. Dogs are trained (very successfully in my experience) to run away when they hear this sound to avoid receiving the shock (and avoid crossing the fence boundary into the road).I purchased this coffeemaker and returned it after one use.
2,so disappointed,"I saved up my money to purchase this coffemaker because it was number one in Consumer Reports and two of my friends have one and I've loved the coffee I've had at their houses. But I can't seem to get a good cup of coffee. If I put in the amount I am used to putting in (about 1 heaping tablespoon per cup made) the coffee is weak. Putting in more sometimes helps...and then sometimes doesn't. It's inconsistent. I've made two full pots now (we only do this on weekends when both my husband and I are drinking it) and the second time I put about 16 tablespoons in (the manual says not to put in more than 15 or the grounds may overflow into the coffee) and it was okay, but not great. I don't know that I can fit much more than 16 tablespoon in there. So, I feel like I've really wasted my money here. At least it looks nice on my counter."
3,A couple of things to think about.,"The coffee maker does look nice and the coffee pot itself is very sturdy and pours real nice. The coffee was hot and tasted like coffee to me. The problems I had with the coffee maker was the condensation behind the maker itself. Your counter does get wet from the lid being opened to the back. Also I move the coffee maker in the morning to pour the water in and every time you touch the stainless housing, your finger prints are on the metal. I saw myself constantly wiping them off. The other thing we noticed is that the clock is not bright at all and we couldn't see what time it was. It does not have an LED clock and is very hard to read the time. We use the clock a lot in the morning before work and it just didn't cut it. Just a couple things I wanted to mention for review because I didn't see anyone else mention these things and they were a big factor to me. Makes good coffee but I was tired of cleaning."
2,back to Krups,"as a long time Krups user thought I'd upgrade to the Cuisinart - unfortunately while the product looks great the coffee just does not deliver. Tried every possible configuration: more coffee, less water, the 1-4 cup setting but the coffee was consistently watery and flavorless. Also agree with the other reviewers that the lack of an external water gauge is annoying. Returned the product and went back to the Krups FME 4 and while the Krups has cheapened the carafe and product the coffee still delivers and thats the ultimate goal"
5,Excellent basic coffe maker,"This is the first non Mr Coffee maker in a long time. I got tired of the burners rusting, leaks, and general ugliness so opted for this tastefully simple one. I love the variable heat plate temp and auto-off settings. Now I can finish a pot w/o having to microwave the last cup and by turning the temp up, it provides that little extra so the cold mug does not cool the coffee too much. It also takes up less counter space than most other 12 cup makers. If I had to pick nits it would be the smaller water reservoir topside opening. Great trade-off.I am very, very happy with this purchase."
3,Broke After Less Than a Year,It worked well while it lasted...it broke after about 10 months usage. The filter broke first (which is not a big deal since I can just use paper ones) and then the spring drip mechanism broke....
3,Nice coffee maker....while it works,"After using the Mr. Coffee brand for years, we decided to try a different brand for comparison. I did like the coffee that it made, but ours lasted for less than a year before it stopped brewing coffee. Reading reviews of automatic drip coffee makers, it seems to be hit or miss as to how long a coffee maker will last. Not sure if we will give this brand another try or not."
3,fire hazard,"For the most part this coffee pot has been great, but one day it just spontaneously started smoking out the bottom and the back of the unit. The smell was burning plastic and/or electronics. Luckily I was standing right in front of the unit when it started smoking, so I quickly unplugged it. I called Cuisinart and they were willing to replace the unit because it was still under warranty - only 2 years old.Not sure I want to use the automatic timing feature now because I wouldn't want the unit to start on fire when I am not there to unplug it!!"
1,Dangerous electrical problem,"After 16 months, this coffee maker shorted out and began making a crackling noise and emitting acrid smoke.Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed MetalIt's a good thing someone was in the kitchen when it happened. I subsequently discovered that many people have had the same thing happen.We'll be contacting Cuisinart ASAP to see what they're going to do....."
2,Just shuts off,"For the past year we have really enjoyed this coffee maker. Now, we set the coffee maker to brew and halfway thru the brewing it just shuts off. We need to unplug, wait a few minutes and plug back in. Not sure if this is just an isolated incident of if it is truly a defect. Whatever it is it's very frustrating...."
2,Good coffee...for two years only,"I bought this Cuisinart two years ago last month. The coffee was great but last week the appliance just died. When I turn it on, nada. Before buying I had read the many, many enthusiastic reviews along with the few who complained that it just stopped working. Now I wonder how many people wrote raves about the product shortly afer buying and then had the same experience up the road!I will not buy this again."
1,coffee maker,"We have used this Cuisinart Coffee maker for about three weeks, brews excellant coffee for us --no problems in using-directions easily understood."
1,Brewing basket overflows making major mess and ruining coffee,"Similar to several other negative reviews, I have not been able to find a consistent way to keep the water from backing up and over-flowing the brewing basket. Tried coarser grind - no improvement. I noticed that the brewing basket holding the coffee pushes up when the carafe is inserted into the coffee maker -- the little door on top of the coffee maker lifts up a little bit. I thought that maybe that was the issue since it worked better a couple of times after I re-pushed the basket down to re-seat it after inserting the carafe. No longer helps. No coffee this morning for guest thanks to this coffee maker. Had to make three pots yesterday to get one that was drinkable. The coffee maker is in the garbage. Good riddance. Not so good riddance hundred some dollars I paid for it. I have several friends with this same coffee maker and the same problem of it over-flowing. Wish I had known that before purchasing this one."
1,lukewarm coffee,"this makes my coffee lukewarm, I thought about boiling the water first and then pouring it into the coffee maker, but that just defeats the purpose of having a coffee maker."
4,A nice coffee machine,"I was previously a die-hard Krups fan. But this Cuisinart is much better.I had a bad experience at first, but exchanged it at the store and this second one works great.With the first one, the auto-off did not reliably work. Sometimes it would shut-off at the selected time. Other times it would never shut-off at the selected time. Sometimes after the coffee had been done for 2 hours, the machine would out-of-the-blue beep indicating the cycle had just ended - when in fact it ended 2 hours ago. You guessed it - the auto-off timer started over. So this seemed like a safety problem.Cuisinart wanted me to send it back with a check for $10 even though it was brand new. Yeah right. I took it back to the store for free and got another one.This second one seems fine so far.It is a nice machine with a lot of nice features. I hate the way you poor the water in though - it always spills - it is in an awkward spot."
1,a HUGE disappointment,"I really should have listened to those who were critical of this machine. I have had it less than a week and it is already broken. This morning my pot of coffee never made it. The cycle ran, a bit of coffee dribbled into the pot and the rest is sitting somewhere in the filter I suppose. I read this happened to others. If you are thinking of purchasing this, maybe you would be wise to take a look at some others. (It is also difficult to get a consistent quality of coffee, every day it was different). I'm going back to my ""old, cheap"" coffeemaker, at least I was guaranteed a cup in the morning."
1,"MAKES WEAK, LUKEWARM, COFFEE","I had to return this coffeemaker due to its weak, lukewarm coffee. It uses twice as much coffee as my 15 dollar Mr. Coffee, the coffee does not taste as good or as strong, and it never gets hot. Stay Away."
2,Doesn't last long,"The pros: makes good coffee, easy pouring carafe, looks attractive.The cons: clock broke almost immediately after purchase, started leaking water after 18 months.Conclusion: it does the job, but not for very long."
1,Leaks water all over the counter,"I have had this product for about a year. About 6 months ago it started leaking water out of the bottom of the coffee maker. My wife loves the way it looks. It makes excellent coffee. I especially like the adjustable temperature control on the burner. However, I would not recommend buying this machine because of the water leaking problem."
3,Was worth the money...,"I was so excited to buy this coffee pot after reading the wonderful reviews. I bought the refurbished one to save $$...and less than a year later, it hasn't been working the greatest. The drip got clogged and would take sometimes 2 hours to brew a pot (a little vinegar cleared that up) - but the carafe leaks. A huge pet peave - when you pour coffee and it dribbles on the counter. That is why I spent more money on one of these, to avoid the dripage - but, here we are again dealing with it. I am overall happy with the pot, I just wish I would have bought a new one instead of a refurbished one (no warranty on mine, a year with a new one)."
5,It makes great coffee!,"I bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200BW coffee maker because Consumer Reports rated it above all others. It makes great coffee and I like the controls being on top rather than on the bottom like my old Krups that just gave up after about 15 years. I like the fact that it has a temp control for the carafe. It also beeps 5 times when the coffee is ready to drink. It will beep 3 times when it does an auto-shut-off. The auto-shut-off feature is programmable for the amount of time between brewing and shut off. It is disabled by default.Two minuses: There is no outside water view, so if you can't remember if you put water in it, you have to lift the lid and look inside. There's a scale in there, so you can see how much water is in it. Number 2 is the LCD time display - it is a little small and an LED display would be easier to read.After buying it, I noticed that Charlie Sheen has the same coffee maker in his kitchen on ""Two And A Half Men""."
4,"Beware of Amazon's recommendation ""Better Together""","It's a fine coffee maker - it makes a nice brew, it is easy to operate and easy to clean.Amazon is being a little disingenuous though, in their recommendation titled ""Better Together"", wherein they suggest that you buy the coffee maker together with the Cuisinart GTF Gold Tone Filter.This coffee maker actually comes with the Cuisinart GTF Gold Tone Filter as part of it's standard equpitment.We got taken on this ten dollar detour and we resent it.I guess the Hippies and the Yippies and the Beats were right about trusting gigantic corporations. Sorry Abbie."
3,"Aesthetically lovely, functionally flawed.","Aesthetically beautiful. Coffee tastes fantastic. However, it is functionally flawed. Be prepared to have a perpetually wet counter top behind the coffee maker as the lid retains condensation and when lifted the condensation drips towards the back of the coffee maker and onto the counter top. Filling the water is a dreadful mess - prepare to be slow and patient. Finally, the time clock is not lit; therefore very difficult to see. It does make a sweet cup of java though."
5,Great Retro Look Coffeemaker,"I almost ""fell for"" the Cuisinart Coffee on Demand maker but after reading several reviews of leaking coffeemakers, I reluctantly settled for this coffeemaker also by Cuisinart. So far, we are loving it! It looks sharp in sleek silver and black - very retro - on our countertop. I highly recommend this coffemaker for it delivers!"
1,Died after just 3 months,"After just 3 months of light use, the pot just stopped brewing. Customer service was nice but wasted my time with worthless troubleshooting. With the time, hassle, and cost of shipping and paying return shipping (required), the warranty was not worth it. Into the trash and never buy another Cuisinart coffee maker."
2,defective,"I had used this coffee maker very little when the clock light went out. Now, although the clock works, I can not see the time. This is very disappointing. I do not know how to fix it or where to take it."
1,"Not real metal, this is plastic made to look metal.","This unit use to be made of real metal now it it plastic painted to look like metal. This is not the same unit from a few years back. This is a new unit under the same name. Amazon should make them rewrite the product description and start orer the product reviews. They should not benifit from old product reviews.I purchased as a gift for someone else so I could not return it, I would have if I could. This unit should sell for about $25. Thanks Cuisinart another product ruined by an MBA."
2,good for the short life it lasts,"Cuisinart DCC-1200. I bought this largely from reviews (and yes, sleek look). When it works, it makes decent coffee. But its engineered very poorly. For one thing, the water level is nearly impossible to see, unless you bend around the side. But the huge problem is that it breaks, apparently because the tube bringing the water up from the back deteriorates and/or jams. Ours did this after just a few months. And there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it, since its not an easily part to replace or to remove and clean. After checking on the Web, it appears others have had this same problem and Cuisinart coud care less. Ugh."
3,Bad lid design,"Bought this after our grind and brew Cuisinart started working sometimes and not others. Could not find a good replacement even from Cuisinart as I think they are getting away from the grind and brew also. Design features great and brews a great pot of coffee that we can control the temp on. However everytime you open the lid to take out old grinds and filter, all the condensate runs down the back of the unit and over the electric wire and counter top. Bad design for the lid. Thinking of returning as this may be an issue later on."
2,Cuisinat DCC-1200 Brew only lasted a year.,"I bought this coffee maker a year and two months ago. It was fine until last week when it suddenly stopped working. Tried everything I could think of, but it just won't brew. After paying that much for a supposed brand name appliance, I think I will just use a French press. No electronic parts to go haywire! Very disappointed."
1,ONLY LASTS A YEAR???,"When we decided to spend so much on this pot, we expected it to last a for quite awhile, as well as brew us some wonderful coffee. It is barely a year old and inexplicably just stopped working? Would have expected more based on name brand and pricing. Will not be buying a replacement like this...sticking with the cheaper brands from now on!"
1,Dangerous & Unsafe,"I bought this coffeepot in April, and was happy with it up until now. After brewing a pot and pouring a few cups on a lazy Sunday, I heard a bubbling sound coming from the kitchen about half and hour later. The coffeepot was BOILING and smoke was coming from the bottom of the warming unit. My husband often leaves for work before I get up, and leaves the warmer on for me. If this would have happened then, it could have burned the house down.After looking at a lot of the reviews here, it doesn't look like an isolated incident. Even if I decided to chance getting a replacement through the warranty, Cuisinart makes you pay for shipping to AND from their facility. Which means I'm out $25, and I have to spend money on Starbucks for at least a few weeks. I will not be buying another Cuisinart again--it's too expensive of a unit to have to be worrying about buying a new one every 9 months, or worrying about it catching fire."
3,Not as good as should be,"I won't be re-ordering this coffee maker. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee since it is easier to use with the water compartment, water level gauge and overall use. Also the coffee is not any better than the Mr coffee brand."
2,"Where's the Steel?? (sung to ""where's the beef""...)","Well (and that's a deep subject, I know) The cusinart DC1200 coffee pot I ordered and received has no ""stainless steel"" that I can see anywhere on it. The item shipped says ""black and stainless steel"" NOT ""black and stainless steel LOOKING. Looks more like black and gray plastic. I've already used it and it blends into stainless steel kitchen ok, but I think I was duped (as in screwed) by Amazon on this one. Won't happen again. BUYER BEWARE! Even the discriptions may not be accurate! S.E.A. Grizzly Flats."
4,Great maker great coffee,"Bought this Cuisinart after our Melitta Mill and Brew broke down after 1 year use. The Cuisinart works great. Not too loud when grinding, and makes great coffee. This has a 12 cup decanter instead of 10 like our old maker. More coffee the better. Also the shut off is longer. Our old maker would shut off after an hour, and we would have to keep turning back on. This Cuisinart is great."
4,Just what I expected!!,It came on time. Was in great shape. Beautiful color. Gave as a gift and my son and daughter in law really liked it.
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"WOW - FABULOUS QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE -- EVERYTHING AND MORE THAN EXPECTED .. SO WORTH THE BIT HIGHER PRICE AND THEN SOME ... WILL STICK TO ""CUISINART"" FROM NOW ON - BOUGHT MORE FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS .."
4,Great coffee maker!,"I recently purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker to upgrade from a very basic DeLonghi and I am very satisfied with my purchase. It has an attractive look, large carafe with removable lid, and produces very hot coffee. I especially like the 1-4 cup setting, which makes sure that smaller cups of coffee are at the right temperature. The dials are different than other coffee makers, but easy to use. I've only had this maker for a few weeks, so I can't comment on dependability. However, it comes with a 3 year warranty which is nice. There is a measurement for water on the inside of the reservoir, but it is very difficult to see. This is the only drawback, but it is really not a big deal. Overall, I would definitely recommend this coffee maker."
4,Very nice coffee maker,"I received this just three days after ordering from Etronics. It came well packed and looks just great. After reading the instructions, which looked daunting at first but proved quite easy, we made ourselves a couple of cups of very tasty coffee. I find that the 'medium' setting for the warmth of the coffee is fine if you want to drink it right away. I programmed it to start brewing for 5:50am this morning and pressed the 1-4 cup setting and voila, it was waiting for me, perfectly brewed. I can't help but wonder if the little 'dohicky' that hangs down and touches the middle of the carafe to stop the flow of coffee mid brew, will hold up, but time will tell. For now, I have no problem recommending this fine maker to anyone. Marcia"
4,"Very pleased, a few minor flaws","I love this coffee maker because it makes a great tasting cup of coffee, and it looks fantastic in my stainless kitchen. I'm sure the water filter is the main reason for the great taste. It doesn't make coffee super fast, but letting the water heat properly and linger on the grounds also makes for great taste. It doesn't take too long, just longer than my last cheap machine.Two things I dislike:I would rather have an insulated stainless carafe.There is quite a bit of condensation on the inside of the lid after the brewing cycle, so I leave the lid open to air it out for a while every time I brew so I don't get mold.Over all, I'm just so happy I can make a nice cup of coffee finally!"
3,"Good Coffee, Bad Design","The machine is designed to make coffee, which it does just fine. However, I fail to notice any difference between the coffee made in this machine and coffee made in my old $15 Proctor Silex model. In addition, the design flaws are pretty annoying as other users have noticed. The condensation does drip down the back of the machine every time you flip open the top lid. The very small opening to pour in fresh water is often a challenge in the wee hours of the morning. You don't get what you pay for on this product."
2,GOOD COFFEE MACHINE - SHORT LIFE,"Purchased from amazon.com in Oct 2010 and worked fine until today, 1-19-13 (about 27 months later). Just refused to brew this morning. System check showed all in order (i.e. maker plugged in, water in resevoir, brew cycle selected, etc. etc). Expected a longer life from this maker."
4,Great brewer,We were in need of a new coffee brewer and wanted to return to Cuisinart brand. This machine is great. Only flaw is the dark interior where the water goes. The coffee is delicious and stays hotter than our old machine.
3,theres better out there,"Makes a good cup of coffee,but not worth the money,even with the rebate.Beeper for end of brewing never did work,but didn't figure was worth the trouble to return.Top to carafe is not easy to put on and take off.It snaps in place.Does not always stop the flow when trying to get a cup before brewing is done,and its not caused from coffee grounds.Would not buy again."
5,The Bet coffee maker yet,"I bought this coffee maker after reading the reviews on amazon and consumers report. I am happy to report I agree with all of the good comments. The coffee maker is fast, produces an very good hot cup of coffee. The lid does not drip on the counter if you open it all the way. I would purchase this machine again."
4,Great coffee maker - but minor criticisms,"I purchased this after some investigation. I had noted in other reviews it was awkward to add water. Frankly, I was not prepared by how inconvenient it really is to add water to the tank without positioning the coffee maker very carefully. There is a gauge inside the water tank so you know how much water to add. It is frankly nearly impossible (at best) to read without positioning the coffee maker in exactly the right light level. By the way, you are sure to spill a little water when filling the tank. Add coffee after filling or you will spill the water all over the fresh coffee grounds.The coffee maker does everything else perfectly. The best suggestion I have is to place your coffee maker on an open part of your counter. If you want to use it under your wall mounted cabinets you will have to move it around all the time.This is a great coffee maker with some poor ergonomics."
4,Stylish coffee maker,"I have own this coffee maker for 3 years without any problems. It is not only very stylish, but it makes great coffee. I especially like the timer function, because it allows me to wake up to a fresh pot of coffee. It also has features that allow you to adjust the temperature of the warming plate and a timer that allows you to adjust how long before it shuts off. And for times you are only making a couple cups, it has a 1-4 cup button.The only thing that is designed poorly is the size of the opening that you have to pour water into. Although, once you get use to it, it's not a problem. The water gauge is hard to see, but isn't really an issue. If you measure your cups of water using the carafe, you really don't need to look at the gauge. Overall a great product."
4,Great Coffee,"The water filter really aids in making great coffee. Very easy to use, nice features including setting the length of time you want it to stay on, up to 4 hours, and it doesn't loose its great taste."
4,I like it very much and it provides us with coffee every day,"A good basic coffee machine. We use Costa Rican coffee in it and have no complaints. We wish they made a white machine instead of the colors offered. It's sort of white, kinda, a little."
5,Great coffeemaker - love the color,"love this coffeemaker, especially the color. Easy to operate and also has a self-cleaning function. also has a carbon water filter to make coffee taste great. no complaints so far. Love it!"
2,Beware!,"My DCC-1200 failed after 7 months, will no longer brew coffee. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones as I have read numerous complaints from owners of these and other Cuisinart coffee makers of failures in the 2nd half this year (2010). The majority of the complaints deal with pots overheating, smoking and some catching on fire. Would not recommend this unit to anyone. See [...]"
4,Really good coffeemaker,"This is a terrific coffee maker. Simple controls for setting time and auto-brew, nice sturdy carafe that doesn't spill coffee all over the counter when pouring, and easy water fill up. The only thing I would change is the display -- it would be easier to read if it were angled up a bit."
5,Combat-Tested Cofee Maker,"I like all the features of this coffeemaker; a simple, no frills design, a cone filter which, in my opinion, provides more flavor than basket filter models, and a good pour (how hard is it to make a carafe that does not drip when pouring from a full pot?). But what most impressed me was the dependability of this coffee maker. From late 2007 to early 2010, this coffee maker sat at the coffee station of our unit HQ at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, supporting the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of Operation Enduring Freedom. Man, did we made some coffee. I mean, 3 pots before noon, and at least 1, sometimes as many as 3 pots after lunch. For one six month rotation, it brewed the midnight shift as well. Alas, as all good things, the heating element finally gave out in March of this year after brewing around 2 and 1/2 years and 4000 pots of coffee. What more can you ask?"
5,Love it,Never had such a nice hot cup of coffee at home before. I prefer the paper filters though and I use spring water and preferred to remove the water filter as well.
2,cuisinart coffee maker,I have a Cuisinart coffee maker. It is leaking at the bottom every time you make a pot of coffee. Cuisinart would sell me a new one for more money than Amazon. Very poor customer service. Has anyone else encountered this problem?J anderson
1,2nd coffie maker that's a dud,"I had this same coffee maker for a little over a year before it quit making coffee. It had to be reprogrammed. It worked for maybe 1 month after doing this. I like the coffee it makes so I bought a new one. I thought maybe they have the bugs worked out. Nope, this one is still under warranty and has done the same thing. Yes they will replace it, but it is very irritating when you can't have coffee in the morning. I will give the replacement to someone I am not fond of as a gift and buy a different brand for myself. They just don't last long enough for the money. We bought my daughter a $10.00 coffee maker for college and 6 years later it still works. I just want a coffee maker that makes super hot coffee and keeps it very hot. I don't need any other bells and whistles. It also has to last longer than 2 years."
1,Burned Up,"This was a good coffee maker until it Burned Up this morning. It actually filled my kitchen up with smoke. I've only had this coffee maker for a little over a year, whats the deal?. What happened to the days of quality construction?So... I'm now researching a quality coffee maker.Buyer Beware!Joe Consumer"
1,Don't buy it!,"After about 7 months of using this machine, the coffee comes out barely warm. I have the temperature set on the hottest setting, but I now have to microwave the coffee to get it to be hot enough to drink. I'm very disappointed with this machine because it was extremely expensive and I just want a good, hot cup of coffee.Also, the taste of the coffee starts to lose strength as well over time. I grind my beans daily but it doesn't make any difference now. My mom bought a cheap, $20.00 coffee maker and it makes better coffee than this machine. Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed within the year!"
1,It was fine until it caught fire this morning,"We've had it for a few years. I was sitting on the couch this morning when it started making a strange noise. When I got up to check on it, smoke was pouring from beneath the warming plate. I'm glad I never left this thing plugged up when not in use. I found other stories in the reviews here, plus more in a quick search, about this model catching fire. Beware."
2,Unreliable,"This product does make a good cup of hot coffee when it works. After six months it started turning itself off any time in the brewing process. Imagine coming into the kitchen for a hot cup of coffee and seeing the thing closed down and the coffee cold! I emailed and called customer service to tell them about the manufacturer's defect and they said,yes it is under limited warranty, but I would have to pay shipping both ways. Why should I pay extra to get the product I spent a lot of money in the first place to buy? Then I would end up spending $90 and buying a lot of hassle as well! Unreliable product and they don't stand behind it. Sorry, I'm not buying a Cuisinart product again."
2,not hot enough,"Temperature was not 180 that Cuisinart service said it should be even on high setting,was 160 to 170. Returned item."
1,Fire hazard - see consumer complaints dotcom - mine nearly caused a fire,Loved the 6 month old coffeemaker up until 1 hour ago when it started smoking - not steam - but like an electrical fire was about to occur. The round rim of the hotplate can't take the heat and was burning. I had noticed the edges were charred before but I thought it was from coffee/water overflow - now I realize it is the rim itself burning. I had to unplug and put outside because it smelled like an electrical fire and the cord exit was smoking. I googled to see many complaints and requests for recalls from the EXACT same situation. I was just heating coffee.I had this for only 6 months. Prior to this I had a Proctor Silex for 16 years!!
2,A ok coffee maker.,"The coffee maker is good. However, the ""ON"" switch is hit or miss - you have to turn around often to make sure its still ""ON"" in the brew stage. For the price - thats unacceptable, I think. Would not order this product again."
4,Great coffee maker,"Makes great coffee and is easy to use. There have been complaints about the water reservoir being difficult to pour water into, but I have not had a problem using a container designed for pouring liquid. The lid is a poor design as water that condensates on the lid drips down the back of the unit onto my counter. A small ledge int he back is obviously supposed to catch this water but is far too small to do the job. I simply open the lid at about 45 degrees and shake it slightly so most of the water drips inside the coffee maker.The timer is easy to set and works great. I really like the adjustable temperature. I don't like coffee that is too hot to drink."
4,Cuisinart Dcc-1200MR Coffeemaker,Overall the coffee maker was what we expected. The color was very nice. And accents our kitchen quite nicely. We did discover two issues which could have improvements: The top hinge seems to detach on the right side sometimes and adding the water can be problematic even with the filter assembly removed.
2,poor quality product,"Bought it thinking it was going to be a ideal coffee maker, wow were we wrong, worst 6 months of coffee ever! Took 15 mins at least to brew...sometimes it just wouldn't work....and this was right out to the box! i recommend that you spend the extra money and get a nice one!"
2,Not very pleased. Doesn't work after 2 years,"Pros:1) Auto Timer - cup of coffee waiting for you in the morning2) Water filter3) Coffee filter (don't need to purchase paper filters4) 4 Cup setting works well when making small pots.5) Adjustable Auto off timer. Coffee Pot shuts off after 1-4 hours automaticallyCons:1) Carafe Lid does not flip up, you must remove it each time you add water2) Reservoir opening is really small3) If the Carafe is not seated correctly, get ready to have a mess to clean up.4) Display is really small & tough to see5) We've owned this for just about 2 years and it kicked the bucket. I've owned less expensive coffee makers that have worked better and lasted much longer with the same/similar ""pro"" features listed above.Because this pot only lasted about 2 year under normal/average use (once a day) I wouldn't recommend."
1,Expensive and Poorly-Designed,"I have had this coffee maker for two months, and I hate it. My wife and I drink a lot of coffee in the mornings, and we have found that when we make a large (12 cup) pot with this machine, the grounds go everywhere. There are little nooks and crannies that fill up with grounds and are hard to get at, and at this point the machine is taking about 30 minutes to make a pot of coffee. The charcoal filter gets clogged up and is more of a hindrance than a help. If you're making a small pot, it's hard to see how much water you have put into the machine -- there is no side window on the water compartment. To add insult to injury, the warming pad does not keep the coffee hot -- after pouring myself a cup I have to put it into the microwave for 15 seconds to get it hot. All in all, I have found this to be a high-priced turkey, and at this point I'm considering tossing it and buying a simpler, less expensive coffee maker."
1,Don't buy Cheap Carafe!,"Purchased this coffee maker and love it, the carafe however is paper thin glass and shattered with a very light tap on the kitchen sink. Very disappointed with Cuisinart for making such a great coffee maker and useless carafe!!"
1,Cusinart DCC-1200BW Brew Central 12 cup Coffeemaker,"This is a terrible shock to me! I thought by spending a little extra money, I would get a better coffeemaker. Well to our surprise, 3 days into using it, it spilled all over the place. Thinking it might be our fault, the next morning, we made sure all pieces were intact, the filter was securly in place and guess what happened! Same thing! So we returned it and got another. Guess what? SAME THING!There must be something wrong with this batch."
1,very unhappy,"I am very disappointed with my coffee maker. The coffee tastes great, but mine leaks out the bottom and really makes a mess. I was not happy with the appliance. although if I set in on paper towel and catch the leak it makes wonderful coffee. I would not buy another one because of this. Maybe if just happened to buy one that was not perfect. I will have to buy another, but not this kind."
5,My daily coffee,"It is a great product, actually I like it so much that this is a replacement from a prior one. great price."
4,Hi-Tech and Lo-Tech,"Cuisinart DCC-1200BCH Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black ChromeI bought this to replace a faithful Braun that lasted for years. This one appears to give a hi-tech apprearance with the black chrome, but the front panel is definitely low tech. Old fashioned toggle switches, unlit LED display is almost useless unless you are 4 feet tall, and one has to lean down to read the panel. Would have been nice to tilt the panel for normal people. Other than that, the coffee brewed is fine in the 2 months I have had it."
4,a very good coffee maker,This coffee maker is a very good coffee maker. I haven't had a problem with it in the month I've owned it and I use it everyday. I love the carafe as it does not drip when you pour and I love the reusable filter so that you don't have to buy filters ever again. The only negatives are that it drips all down the back when you open the top to change the grounds or add more water. Also adding the water is just a little tricky because it is a small area to pour into and it is right by where the top hinges up so it is a restricted area somewhat. But all in all it does a good to great job. 4 and a half stars would have been the right rating.
4,Different breed of cat,"Just brewed my 1st cup of coffee with the Brew Central DCC-1200.Before my purchase through Amazon I read all 58 reviews of this product and was concerned about the 50-50 division of opinion on the quality of the brew, whether it was hot enough (I need it hot), and the water mess on the counter when the cover was raised. I should add that I recently purchased and returned a Krups (great coffee but a clunker for endurance--froze up twice after a few months operation) and Capresso (dull, undrinkable coffee).My empiracle assessment of the DCC-1200 is that:1. The brew is superior;2. It is hot--can't see how it could be hotter;3. A plastic lip connected to the reservoir cover on the back of the machine catches any condensation runoff when the cover is raised."
4,Had a few - this is the best,"Over the years, I have had many coffee pots. This is by far the best and I noticed the difference in the first pot. I like having the filter and I also use filtered water to brew coffee. After all, if you spend this much on a coffee pot, you also need good coffee, and Starbucks is not good coffee, try Peets. Then use water that has been filtered, like through a Pur unit. Most excellent cup of coffee. I gave the unit 4 stars just because of a few engineering flaws already mentioned. The clock is not big/bright enough, when the lid is lifted up all at once it drips down the back so I lift it half way to let it drip inside and then all the way. I only move the unit by holding the bottom sides where there is no metal so as not to leave prints. But all metal does that. All and all, it is a great machine."
3,Some quirky features,There are two things about this coffee maker that drive me crazy and one (if I knew about it ahead of time) would have caused me not to buy it. The coffee maker beeps -- for four very loud beeps -- when the coffee is finished brewing. It wakes up the dog and everyone else in the house. In my view this feature is completely unnecessary and annoying. The second quirky feature of this machine is that the opening for the water compartment is very small and awkwardly situated at the very back of the coffee maker. You must be tall and have a steady hand to get the water where it belongs.
2,"Brews okay, but not for the coffee connossieur","1) If you love coffee, don't buy a glass caraffe that will burn the bottom after the coffee sits for about 15 minutes; opt instead for a thermal insulated caraffe option.2) If you like to make a full pot, this coffee maker only holds enough coffee to brew 1Tbsp per cup. If you liked stronger coffee or brew with the method recommended by many gourmet brands, you will not be able to fit enough coffee in the machine to make a full pot to your desired strength.Cuisinart is a great brand, and I love most of their appliances;I even like the Burr Grinder that I own. They haven't taken on the coffee space as experts with this machine."
1,Choose another coffeemaker,"Buying this coffeemaker was a mistake. 1) poor design: there is no good way to know how much water is in the machine - you have to look inside where there are stairstep cup indications, and estimate how much water is in there if it's less than 10 cups because the lower stairsteps are out of sight! 2) the 'auto-timer' never worked because the clock couldn't be set. Broken from day one. We don't actually NEED an autotimer so we put up with that, and so now, a year or so after purchase: 3) overnight, with no warning, it doesn't make coffee anymore. Just up and quit. Monday - made pot of coffee. Tuesday - add grounds, add water, flip switch, ""On"" light goes on and nothing. I guess that means the heating coil has given out, or something like that. Overall, what a disappointment and waste of money."
1,Stopped working after a year and a few months,"I purchased this for my mom for a christmas present. That was december of 2010. Now it is February 2012 and it does not work anymore. I have gone through the manual and online reviews. It seems there is a big percentage of folks that have it crap out on them. You fill the water, fill the grounds, put the lid on the carafe, set it to brew and turn it on and nothing happens. I'm an engineer by trade, starting diagnosing, it appears some of the electronics inside burned out. Most likely they are putting cheap electronics from china / taiwan which will always have a pretty large failure rate on parts. So don't buy this, unless you want to gamble with your money that you won't be one of 20-30% that have a problem.That all being said, it does have a 3 year warranty, but I'm not going through the hassle of gambling for another one and wasting shipping (20 total for both ways) when I can just buy a cheapy from walmart that will last until I'm dead and buried."
1,failed after 2 years,"the coffee maker leaked from the bottom since first day. After two years, it just died this morning. turned it on, nothing happened--so in the garbage it goes. the other one I just bought has a cleanme light that goes on every week. Looks like something might be going on there also. YUCK"
5,excellent coffee maker at a great price!,"this machine is fabulous. it is sleek and has easy to use buttons and knobs. the coffee is excellent and i love that i don't have to use all that much coffee grounds for a wonderful cup! love the brew stop feature and i love that i can brew a small pot for just myself. not sure that i would say it comes out piping hot as advertised, but still a great tasting cup of coffee. the black chrome color also conveniently doubles as a mirror if you need a last minute touch up! lol"
1,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed Metal","I bought this coffee maker about 1 year ago..we use it one time a day which I would consider light use, got up one morning and there was a burning odor coming from somewhere, found the warming plate RED HOT coffee boiling..thank goodness we were up that morning and had to turn the coffee maker on...Cuisinart did offer to replace the coffee maker but what I find most important is that there are numerous complaints on line about this same issue and no recall has been issued..based on this I refused the new coffee maker and went for another brand..in my opinion the coffee maker should have lasted longer than a year..but with all of the complaints that I read online the fire/burn hazard should cause Cuisinart to maybe recall this item."
2,Doesn't last a year,"I have bought two of these; both stopped working within a year. At that price, they should have lasted quite a bit longer. Still looking for a good, sturdy coffeemaker."
1,waste of money,"Since moving I have owned at least ten of these coffeemakers. I bought my first Cuisinart coffeemaker because it went well with all the stainless steel in my kitchen. They don't last. If you own one that works for two years consider yourself lucky. The toggle switch is arcane. All together these look great but aren't made very well. I am on my last one, when this one goes south maybe I'll try a Breville. Couldn't be worse."
3,"Brews good coffee, BUT lacks simple functions",The coffee brewed is good. But I simply don't like this appliance. First of all the lid of the coffee pot has to be removed - it doesn't flip up - you have to always remove it to fill it with water or rinse it - I can see this not lasting long. Another thing - in order to see how much water you've poured in - if you don't want to pry off the lid to fill the pot with water - is too peer down into the well. I have to stand on a stool with a flashlight to see at what mark the water is at!!!! Thats ridiculous.
1,Worst coffee pot I've ever owned,"I purchased this coffee pot for one reason, the heating plate which allows you to select your coffee temperature. I do like this feature, however the rest of the coffee pot is too complicated for my taste. In over 44 years of marriage I have owned a lot of coffee pots and this was the most expensive and hardest to operate. The big complaint is that it is just plain messy!! If you grind you coffee too fine it swells up and gets all thru the coffee pot and was a real pain trying to get all of it out of the coffeemaker. We also have the black model which makes it hard to see the water level when pouring the water in. Next time I will buy a more simple brand and less expensive. A longer cord would be helpful. I do not notice any change in the taste of the coffee. Your money is best spent elsewhere."
2,"Be warned, very poor warranty","I give this coffee maker a 5 star rating for design, quality of materials, and function. I take away 3 stars for their poor idea of a warranty. This company not only requires that you pay for your own shipping under warranty, they also charge you a ""shipping and handling"" fee to repair and return. Compared to other high end products, see ""Kitchen"" for example, this is a really crappy deal. Most cover all shipping charges. I have never seen one from a reputable company that sticks you both ways.This is the last product I will get from these people.Added after a year of ownership:Almost all the features and quality are overcome by the constant spilling EVERY TIME I open the lid to make coffee. The amount of condensation that leaks out the back needs to be cleaned up constantly and, after a year, is a real pain. Be prepared."
1,"nice controls, lousy coffee","Maybe we just got a bad unit, but our brand-new Cuisinart DCC-1200 makes coffee that tastes muddy, flat, and dull. That's a pity, because the features and the design of the controls are excellent. For a six-cup pot of coffee, the brewing cycle takes 7 minutes. That seems overly long -- too much extract? Although the instructions recommend medium-fine grind, we switched to perk grind, the coarsest available. The results were definitely improved, but still third-rate. There could be a problem with the water temperature. Our other two coffeemakers make a brew with brightness and snap. We have a Krups electric drip, topped only slightly by the old-fashioned manual Melitta drip."
3,so so,The first coffee maker that was shipped to me did not work at all. I plugged it in and nothing happened. Both coffee makers were shipped in the manufacturers box which was damaged upon arrival. The second coffee maker has worked so far however the top lid doesn't close tightly and that's a little disappointing because I think it may cool the water slightly.
1,A Terrible Coffee Maker,"The only way to open the carafe is to pry it open with a knife, and, based on how thin the plastic is, I imagine this will work for about a month before I'm simply hosed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,STRONG plastic cracking sound and plastic smell,"I am surprised at that hundreds of reviewers just never mentioned two things concerning every and each coffeemaker.One is that it seems to me that all plastic made coffeemaker would have annoying plastic cracking sound when the internal plastic is heated and tends to expand. This model is no exception, though it has a metal outlook. Placing the coffeemaker in my study, I just could not keep the room quiet.The other is that the coffee brewed by coffeemaker with plastic part is always smell plastic -- stronger or weaker. For this model, I have to said, it is strong. A thermal pot is much better but I just dont want to spend another fifty dollars. Can I buy a plastic-freed item in the market?"
3,Not for me,"My KRUPPS coffee maker just died after 4 years, so I decided to replace with this model. It looked great in the pictures, and when it arrivedwe were excited to try it out. The minute we turned it on it began making an electrical ""Ozone"" smell. We unplugged it immediately and shipped it back. We are not going to replace it. Tooo bad. It looked great. Also, the power cord is very short. My Krups cord was 44 inches log - this one is about 24. Just did not work for us. I cannot review the operation of the machine - we never got to use it."
2,Fine...for a while,"We purchased this coffeemaker for its sharp retro styling and because Cuisinart tends to be a reliable brand. It worked fine for several months, and then began having difficulty brewing. The heater simply burns off water into steam so 12 cups of water might slowly brew only 8 cups of very, very strong coffee. We tried cleaning it, brewing only 10 cups at a time, varying the grind size...nothing worked. A phone call to Cuisinart very impressively resulted in a no-hassle replacement with a new unit. However, the new unit soon presented the same problems as the previous one. We know how to read and carefully followed the instructions provided in the manual, but it makes no difference. We are now looking around for a less expensive Mr. Coffee or other brand. Not as sharp looking, but in the end, you can't pour a snazzy appearance into a mug and drink it."
1,Worked perfectly right up until it didn't,"Overall one of the best ones I've used, but after just over 6 months one morning it just didn't work.Flipped the switch, power cycled it, etc, and no coffee.Too expensive not to last."
4,Surprisingly good machine,"Frankly I don't need anything this hi-tech to make a pot of coffee. That said, we've been delighted with the ease of use, drip-free pouring, and especially the quality of the coffee produced. We'd select this one again without hesitation. Good price, too.There are some design quibbles. The brew switch is an odd, small, sharp lever. The readouts and printed labeling are WAY too small. And you do have to pull the thing out on the counter to get the water in. See other reviews for other complaints.What puts this machine in perspective is the DeLonghi equivalent coffemaker my office purchased. Not only is it nightmarish to use, but the coffee's awful! You have to use more grounds to get the same strength as what this Cuisinart produces, and meanwhile you've dribbled coffee all over the counter. Caveat emptor."
2,Not a long-lasting appliance,Our Cuisinart is less than a year old and is acting up. I've always found it inconvenient to pour the water into the side back without spilling some into the coffee or on the counter. Also when brewing there is so much steam leaking out the top that ruined the bottom front of our cabinet. We had to buy a small table just for the coffee pot. Aside from that it made very good coffee up until now.It's less than a year old and stops brewing half way thru the cycle. We need to restart the brew lever to finish the pot. I've kept it clean and replaced the filter but that doesn't seem to add to the life of the pot. I'll be looking for a new one (not Cuisinart) but am afraid all new appliances don't last like the old ones.Sue W.
2,Died after 1 year of service,It made great coffee while it worked. This morning the heating element would not turn on -- no coffee! On the fence if I want to try the warranty service.
2,KBaca,"I purchased this item about 9 months ago and I am already having problems with it. I noticed recently that the clock will just turn off, which disrupts the auto-brewing. I wake up in the morning and the coffee has brewed,who knows when, and is already cold. Recently it has just been turning off on its own even though I have the auto-off set for 2 hours. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,"Beautiful styling, mediocre coffee!","The beautiful appearance and unique styling of this coffee maker convinced me to upgrade even though I wasn't actively seeking a replacement. Indeed, the great attention to styling detail and high build quality of the machine are impressive relative to others I've used over the years.Unfortunately, the quality of coffee it produces is substandard and far below that of the $20 Mr. Coffee I've been using for years. As the only coffee drinker in our home, I usually brew a four cup pot. Even when selecting the 1-4 cup option, the coffee never approaches the desired temperature for an ideal cup. I brewed several pots, varying the grind and amount of coffee, with and without the charcoal filter, and I was never able to produce the robust cup of coffee I have been enjoying for years. With regret, I will be returning it for a refund later today."
2,Looks Nice But ...,"My wife and I run an Internet cafe, and we bought two Cuisinarts to back up our Bunn coffee maker.While the Cuisinarts look beautiful and make good coffee, it's never hot enough - not even to begin with, and a half hour later we may as well have unplugged it. Even on the hot setting, the Cuisinarts won't keep coffee hot.For that reason alone, I'd never buy another one and don't recommend them."
1,"All fluff, no stuff","This waste of money coffee maker that i received as a gift is an example of great looks and poor design. There is no outside water level and the inside water level is hard to read without a flashlight. The knobs and switches all look cool but the coffee does not get hot enough, so i have to microwave it. Finally, the decanter leaks when you pour coffee, so some coffee is always left on the counter and mug. Come on. Is it too much to design a coffee maker that is easy to fill, does'nt spill and gives you a hot cup of coffee? I really hate it, i hope it breaks."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"Shame on Cuisinart for putting on the market such a piece of junk. I'm trying to learn to be civil, so I can't use a more appropriate four-letter word than 'junk'.There's an obvious manufacturing flaw that ineffectuated both of the machines I got from Bed, Bath & Beyond. The funnel-shaped filter holder is spring-loaded at the bottom and requires pressure from above in order to drip. However, once the water had dripped just a tiny bit, not enough pressure was exerted and the coffee machine stopped dripping!I called Cuisinart, which had me on hold for twenty minutes before sending me to a very, very rude CSR who fully exuded her boredom, impatience and supercilliousness towards me. Then she simply said, ""you gotta take it back to the store"". So I did, only to be given another one with THE EXACT SAME DEFECT.Thanks Cuisinart... for nothing! I always thought you made aesthetically nice products BUT WHO CARES IF THEY DON'T WORK!"
1,I should have known better than to buy this!,"We had the same Cuisinart DCC-1200 at my work and it lasted about one year before the heating element died. So much for that. I just bought this for my mother and it was a TOTAL WASTE of MONEY. Please LOOK ELSEWHERE as this has some SERIOUS FLAWS. First, if you like your coffee hot, forget it! Lukewarm is about all this machine can make. Going back for a second cup? Not unless you like your coffee ICE COLD! And that is after just 5 minutes! If you didn't have a microwave near by to reheat the coffee you would really suffer. The design is very bad. The water reservoir is small and hard to see into and very hard to pour water into. Overall, I wouldn't give this even one star. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART COFFEEMAKER. Very very bad. I should have known better. All my mother wanted was a decent cup of coffee and you would think that a machine at this price would deliver. I am disappointed."
1,Two broken - We're back to Mr. Coffee,"This is a followup to an earlier review on this coffee maker.After reading the good reviews, I decided to get this coffee maker when my 10 year old Mr. Coffee finally bit the dust. It's a nice looking coffee maker, for what that's worth, and it makes a good cup of coffee, but not any better than any other coffee maker. As for my experience, we went through two of these in about 4 months. First one leaked and emptied all of the water in the tank onto the counter. I spent about $20 to return it to Cuisinart (Their warranty requires that you pay shipping BOTH ways.) The replacement went into ""cleaning"" mode after about a month and it wouldn't turn off. So after $130, it's in a landfill somewhere and I'm back to my $19 Mr. Coffee - which makes coffee just fine."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this machine from Bealls of Florida, not Amazon. My old Mr. Coffee quit after 15+ years, so I started looking for a new one. Consumer Reports rated this machine #1 in their December '09 issue. Based on this, and the fact it looks really cool, I bought it.The first thing I didn't like was the position of the water reservoir opening, in the back corner of the machine....it's too small. When I used the carafe to fill it, I had to completely turn it upside down to empty it - another poor design. The worst was yet to come. After it finished brewing a very good cup of coffee, it made a terrible racket. It popped and crackled for at least half an hour, until I turned it off. The next day, I made another pot and the same thing happened. Very irritating. The following day it went back to Bealls.I now have a Mr. Coffee JWX27 from K Mart - half the price, no noise, and good coffee."
5,Cuisinart Brew Central,This is a great coffee maker. It is easy to use and keeps the coffee as hot as you want. My last coffee maker was a Bunn at a much higher price and the Cuisinart is probably better. I like the fact that I can pour a cup before it is finished brewing. I will definitely purchase more Cuisinart products.
4,Fabulous Product,"I have had many a coffee maker over the years and this is by far the best. I went with Cuisinart as I have been very pleased with previous Cuisinart purchases. They didn't disappoint me this time either. The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. It's easy to fill, easy to clean. I was thrilled with my savings over the department store price. Delivery was fast. Overall a positive experience with Amazon and the coffee pot."
2,Not as good as the rating suggests,"After reading several of the reviews for this maker, I thought ""must be great"". I bought it.The first pot, I used cold filtered water from the fridge. The pot took 9 minutes and 37 seconds to brew. (the optimum time is 4 min 30 sec)The next pot, I used warm water and knocked alomst two minutes off and the third, I used hot hot water in the maker. The pot brewed at just over seven minutes.I love the design, I love the toggle switch in the front for the on/off. I love the knobs (cheap though) the whole thing feels cheap except for the caraffe. I think it's an ""inexpesive to build but make it expensive so people think they're getting an awesome coffee maker"" type of situation. Either way, the heating element is way too small."
2,Maybe 2.5 stars,"I've had this pot for 6 years, so the longevity is good, however, 2 IMPORTANT problems with mine:1. From the beginning the pot does not always start brewing when you press the on switch. Have to turn it off and on, unplug it, fiddle with it to get it to start, OR sometimes I'll forget about it and realize after an hour that it still hasn't brewed anything; nothing happens, the pot warmer doesn't even get hot. This is a real PAIN IN THE BUTT when you need to leave for work.2. The water goes in where the coffee goes in and cleaning this is a problem. There needs to be some separation here as you end up with coffee grounds in your water... Now, they've put in a filter mechanism to filter your water, but it gets really gross really fast after some grounds get in there. Also, the water level markers are inside the water resevior and are very hard to see.Cuisinart makes wonderful food processors; leave the coffee up to Krups, Capresso, Bunn, the real coffee makers..."
2,get tthe service plan,Makes good coffee for several months then is prone to clogging. Filters are expensive and need to be replaced often. Lasted only one year.
2,Worked great--till it died 2 1/2 months later,"I got this as a gift for a friend for Christmas. She loved it and used it almost daily until it met it's untimely demise this weekend. No idea what's wrong with it, but the clock died first and now it won't even turn on. Save your money and buy something else."
1,BREAKS after minimal use,"I loved this coffee maker when it was working fine, but after minimal use, it became stuck in a ""cleaning"" mode and took up to an hour to make a full pot. I should have bought a warranty, but I never considered CUISINART would make such a crappy product, especially considering their prices. After reading other reviews of people who experienced the same thing, I would not buy a Cuisinart maker again. Thanks for REVIEWS! (should have read them!)"
2,What's happened to this great coffeemaker?,"I absolutely loved my last Cuisinart DCC-1200 and was sorry to see it give out after MANY years of service. When a friend on my recommendation recently ordered one, I was surprised when she complained that the thing spewed and sputtered and spit and practically walked across the counter. I assured her that she must just have the one in a million dud. I didn't hesitate to buy another one. Well, guess what? Mine spews and sputters and spits and practically walks across the counter. It brews coffee. The coffee is good. However, I can only think that all this noise does not bode well for this thing lasting. Something tells me the company has changed something and changed it NOT for the better."
5,Great Cuisinart coffeemaker,"We have been using it for a couple of weeks and the only complaint is that there is no external water level indicator to let you know how much water you have poured into the machine. You have to look into the coffeemaker and look at the numbers that are inside - it's a bit awkward to do that. It makes great coffee, has an easy timer system so that the coffee is ready when we get up and has a timer that turns it off so that we don't have to remember to do that. This machine replaced a basic Krups coffeemaker that we had for at least twenty years."
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200 is a Great Product,"The Cuisinart is a very good coffee maker. It is smart and stylish with a nice stainless steel appearance. It makes great coffee in only a few minutes and the only negative is that it will sometimes drip when removing the carafe for a ""quick"" cup before machine is through. I would highly recommend this unit to friends and relatives."
1,Second Cuisinart that has had an early demise,I purchased this coffeemaker on 8/20/10 and this morning 3/25/11 I went to make coffee and the light comes on but the coffee will not brew. My previous coffeemaker was the Cuisinart Grind and Brew and it did the same thing. I am very disappointed with this product and will never recommend a Cuisinart Coffeemaker to anyone. What a waste of money ! Of course I am past my warranty.
3,Not worth the money.,"I purchased this electric because of it's striking design, and programable delayed brewing. While it worked nicely for two years, just a month out of warranty it died! Overhaul, it was a good coffee maker but several design quirks made it difficult to use. The very small water reservior filling area is almost unusable. It's such a confined area, you end up spilling water all over the place. The second quirk is the NON- LIT very small digital display. Putting aside it only lasted two years, I decided to purchase another one. I ran out to one of local retailers and paid the $79 retail pop, used the new pot 3 days and the display died. It would shut off mid brew. At this point I returned it and bought a Mr Coffee 12 cup programable pot which I am very pleased with. In closing, the Cuisinart is too expensive, and doesn't over anything different than the 100s of other brands out there."
4,Cuisinart Coffeemaker,"This is my first non-Braun coffeemaker. Had it for about two weeks now and very pleased. I like the flip top lid, easy to remove the filter and coffee basket. The water bin is a bit awkward to reach, have to be a bit careful in spilling water. There is a number of cups water guide in the water bin, but unless you are looking directly down at it it's very hard to see. It makes good tasing coffee. Warming plate has three adjustable settings which is also nice. Cleanup is very easy with the Cuisinart."
4,Excellent coffeemaker!,"The only drawback on this coffee maker is where you pour the water in. It would be an easier design if it were positioned in the front corner. That being said, the features of this coffee maker make it an excellent and useful machine. The programmable timer makes life ever so much easier, and the auto shut-off is a godsend. The styling is sleek and fits well into any kitchen that may have black or stainless appliances. The timer also being *above* the coffee delivery system make this machine less prone to being 'shorted' out. I love the beeps when the brewing cycle is finished too!Great value for the money!"
1,Coffee brewer is a fire hazard,"I have had the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central for a little over a year. This morning, for no apparent reason, it started to smoke profusely and give off an acrid burning smell. I was lucky to be nearby at the time, otherwise I don't know if it could have burned and done damage in my kitchen. I am throwing it away. I suggest anyone thinking about purchasing this item first do a check on its safety. There is a page here on Amazon in which many people report the same problem."
1,Unsafe Coffee Maker,This was my second Cuisinart Coffee Maker. The first one had an issue with the clock right after the warranty ran out therefore programming was out of the question. I bought a second one and this morning it started spewing heavy white smoke and a horrible burning electrical smell (I've had this one just over a year as well). Good thing I was home. It is now sitting on my concrete back patio. I called Cuisinart to let them know what happened and I was told that it would take 4-5 days for them to get back to me. It is not safe to have these in your home. Clearly there are issues with this model.
1,Candidate for a recall,"Purchased this product in June 2010, just over two years ago. Today, what I thought was a great coffeemaker (Cuisinart DCC-1200) could have started an electrical fire in my house. Circumstance: coffee maker was turned OFF but plugged in. All of a sudden, heard a bubbling sound in the carafe-- c. 1 cup of coffee was boiling on its own. Then smoke started coming out rear where cord is attached. Unplugged entire unit immediately and took outside. Smoke was coming out of the bottom metal plate. I checked other consumer advocacy sites and discovered similar complaints. This product should be recalled. At the very least, please unplug when unattended and not at home."
5,Killer coffee!,"Did a lot of research before buying a coffeemaker and I'm really happy with this one. Really satisfying coffee...Love being able to set the temperature of the pot warmer for after brew, and to select a setting for a small pot of coffee as I have this near my desk at work and make 1 or 2 cups at a time. Great price for the value."
3,"good coffee, lousy carafe","I bought this model of coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. We have now used it about 10 times at most. The coffee maker itself is fine, and he loves the coffee, but the carafe just cracked! We called Cuisinart, and oh, guess what? The carafe isn't covered under their warranty. Gee thanks...now we have to spend either $25 for the glass carafe or $48 for the stainless carafe. Word to the wise...buy the stainless since it can't crack."
2,Keeps getting clogged,"We have purchased this coffee maker three times now. The first time it clogged it was our fault because someone over filled the coffee with very fine grounds and the mess was just too big to clean up. The second time it clogged was just a few months after we had purchased our second machine. This time we returned it thinking there was a problem with the machine. We are now tossing out our third machine. This device does make a good cup of coffee, however, it's design seems flawed. We followed all cleaning/care instructions and were careful about not using fine grounds and the darn thing still clogged. This time, btw, it clogged after a recent clean. Worked fine, then I cleaned it and now it just makes lots of noise and steam. UGH! Wont be buying a forth machine.One more thing, all three never allowed us to take the pot out before the brewing process was complete...always dripped."
2,Don't purchase,I've purchase two of these coffee pots. The first one worked good for 1 year and then just stopped working. I decided to purchase another one because it made good coffee. The second one purchased worked for 6 months and then started on fire. I would definetly go a different route.
2,Should have bought another,"This unit started having problems about a year ago and today it died. This coffee maker was not cheap. I bought this in '08 so maybe it's not supposed to last more than 3 years? I don't know. If you're thinking about purchasing this unit, don't"
4,Very good coffeemaker,"When my beloved Braun died, I was disappointed to learn that Braun has apparently discontinued their coffeemakers in the U.S.However, I am happy with this Cuisnart. It makes very good coffee. The only thing I don't like is the water reservoir: the opening is so small, it makes pouring water into it a little awkward. The water level indicator is inside the reservoir, which makes it hard to see how much water is there. Other than that, I have no complaint. I'm glad to report that I haven't had any of the problems mentioned in several Reviews; no spills, no overflows. The people at Cuisinart must have read the Reviews,too, the beeps are barely audible! I love the carafe, it never drips coffee.I would recommend this Coffeemaker to anyone !"
5,Cuisinart DCC-1200BCH Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker...,"Good brew and coffee pot, this is my 2nd one in over 15 years. I grind my coffee beans separately."
1,"Buyer Beware - Cuisinart DCC-1200, Clearly defective","I purchased a DCC-1200 Coffee Maker based on the positive reviews. I wish I had read the one star opinions. Our first unit was purchased in February 2009 and produced a daily, decent cup of coffee until May 2009 when it just died. I called Cuisinart Customer Support who informed me they would send a replacement unit if I agreed to pay ten dollar shipping cost. I agreed and two weeks later the replacement unit arrived. Five months passed now the replacement unit just died. Same as the first unit. Made coffee one morning, dead the next. What a lousy product. Cuisinart should be ashamed to put their name on it. Do not purchase!"
1,Cuisinart Should Only Make Food Processors !!!!!,"If you're reading this chances are you are interested in a Cuisinart but haven't made the purchase yet.Don't buy a Cuisinart!!!!!They could not have made a worse design. The water goes into such a tiny chamber in the corner that we had to buy a small watering can with a long thin spigotto fill it, otherwise we'd have a big water puddle all over the counter every time. Coffee was just OK (that's the only reason for the star) but stopped working after 18 months. We are shopping for another coffee maker and and it will be ANYTHING but a Cuisinart. Save your money, time and aggravation....keep shopping for another brand!"
2,Not for bifocals or arthritics...,"LED display not legible unless at eye level. Dial labels also extremely small as are the dials themselves - hard to manipulate. Otherwise, great coffee."
5,Small hole? You probably drank too much coffee,"I had read on consumer reports that this was one of the top drip coffee makers out there. But as I started reading customer reviews on Amazon, I began to second guess their review.All I can say is: trust the numbers -- this machine has many more positive then negative reviews. The coffee tastes great and the complaints are just nitpicky. The one my wife and I laughed the most about is that ""the water receptacle opening is small, so you should keep a towel handy when pouring water in the machine."" The opening is not large, but if you're missing that opening, maybe you should cut down on your coffee consumption.We've had ours for about 1 month and use one to two times every day (and haven't missed the hole once). So far, we love it."
5,Donna's Coffee Maker,"I got this coffee maker for my wife based on my son & daughter-in-law having one from their wedding. She loves it, and the only criticism we have is that the water reservoir is difficult to access, and the water level is hard to see (she is 5 feet tall and cannot see the level indicator). An externally visible water level glass/indicator would be a nice addition. I would buy this one again anytime."
2,Good But Bad,"I've had mine for aboout 2.5 years. I have been too lazy to find another until recently. It used to be only occasionally that water/coffee would not enter the pot but would overflow onto the burner, counter and floor. Now it does it more often than not! Not only that but it now also overflows from the the top of the coffee basket. I have thoroughly cleaned all of this area and it still does it. Obviously, there is something wrong with the spring mechanism in that brewing cone. But it seems you can't just buy that. You have to get a whole new machine! Based on what others have told me about their experiences with Cuisinart stuff since Conair bought them, I think I want a whole new brand?"
2,Disappointed in Cuisinart,I ordered this based on recommendation in Consumer Reports but I am disappointed in both the quality and features. The only way to get the right amount of water is to measure it first in the carafe because you can't see the markings or water level inside the black unit where you fill it. The unit doesn't slide easily on the counter top and the piece that holds the coffee grounds is flimsy and fragile. Water drips down the back of the unit if you open the lid too high to remove the used coffee grounds and filter. This is not near the quality of my old Braun coffeemaker with it's visual gage for filling and easy to remove carafe.
1,"Can't fill, can't pour","All Cuisinart machines are impossible to fill without making a mess. Additionally, the pouring spout on the carafe is poorly designed making it is difficult to pour coffee without dripping it.You would think that Cuisinart would redesign both the lid to the water reservoir and the spout of the carafe.I just abandoned two Cuisinart DCC-1200 machines for the new Waring Pro Coffee Maker. The Waring product seems much easier to operate and does not leave water or coffee on the counter."
3,A coffee pot,"It makes coffee. We replaced a Hamilton Beach which was easier to use. It uses pointed filters instead of the standard flat filters. To fill you need to measure the water in something. We like using the hose from the sink, but can't see the markings in the reservoir. We make a pot a day but seem to go through coffee posts every 18 months. Last Cuisinart we had was replaced under warranty. I am interested to see if this makes its 3 year warranty."
2,On the fritz after about 2 years,"We liked it while it worked. Nice appearance, good coffee. Pouring the water in was a little awkward and on some bleary eyed mornings, much ended up on the counter, rather than in the reservoir. But for $70, I wasn't going to chuck it for that. Adapt and overcome.The first thing to stop working was the auto brew function, followed several months later by the manual brew function. She'll perk about 6 cups and shut off completely. If the plate would stay hot, my husband and I would just make do with 3 cups each (Doc says my daily 4 are too much, anyway).If you want to spend $70 every 2 years for a coffee maker, this is a 5 star product. I'd prefer it lasted as long as my Grandmother's percolator...forever...without having to adapt to its eccentricities!"
3,How long should a coffee maker work?,"Handsome machine made good coffee - for five years, until a short left it worthless. So, I don't know if I recommend it: How long do you think a coffee maker should work?"
5,Super Coffee Maker,We have had this coffee maker for over two years and find to be the best coffee maker we have ever had in our fifty plus years of marriage.
4,Very Pleased,"I bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200MR coffee maker after our second Bunn started to leak after only 3 years. We really liked the Bunn makers but they don't hold up long after the warranty wears out. After reading several coffee maker reviews, I purchased the Cuisinart. It brews fairly fast and the controls are easy. The coffee is as good as the Bunn. The only negative is that the water reservoir opening is small so I end up with water spilling a lot. It would be great if the reservoir could be removed or made larger. Also, it's a little tall to fit under my upper cabinets so be sure to measure if you need to put it under a cabinet. Other than that, I'm pleased with the quality of the coffee, which is the main thing after all!"
2,Great While It Lasts,"We bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200 based on a Consumer Reports review a couple of years ago. We had been very impressed with the coffee produced and even purchased one for the office. Today the coffee maker wouldn't turn on. After unplugging it and trying it again, I was able to get it to brew a quick pot. Then it died again. Unplugging and plugging it back in turned it on for a moment and then it died completely. I did a quick check on the Internet and found many consumers have complained about similar issues with the DCC-1200. Several have experienced electrical issues which included fires. I would not purchase this coffee maker again. I give the DCC-1200 two stars because it was great while it lasted but I expect my appliances to work for more than two years."
1,It's the Cuisinart!,"This was my third Cuisinart coffeemaker and I was disappointed. This unit lasted just about nine months to the day. Should have returned it immediately when I noticed it did not brew the coffee as hot as others had. Today I replaced it with another Cuisinart.Okay, its the Cuisinart. My new purchase only makes the coffee a bit warmer than the last. Returning it and changing brands."
3,Not satisfied,"This coffee maker had a few problems for us, maybe others would not see them as problems. First, we found it too tall especially with the lid open, we had to move it too far beyond the kitchen cabinets above it to fill it. Then the area to be filled, is very tiny, it is not large like our old coffee maker and you have to really aim the faucet hose or water carefully to fill it, that was a deal breaker. Finally, the lid on the carafe was impossible to get off, my wife could not snap it off at all and I found it hard to remove, all in all, not a good experience for us."
1,heating plate stopped working,i only had this coffee maker a couple of weeks and the heating plate quit working i have had a lot of bad luck with coffee makers the last few months.i bought it at jcpennys and they were great they took it back and gave me a refund no question asked.it did make real good tasting coffee but you expect it to work longer than a couple of weeks. oh well my quest gones on for a good reliable coffee maker
1,"Dangerous product - not recommended, likely a fire hazard","Owned it for about 17 months. Two main problems: very easy to crack the carafe (~$25 to replace). So easy that I have no idea how I did it. Twice. Second and more serious issue. As it was making coffee one day I heard a series of popping/crackling sounds, then smoke and electrical fire smell. Fortunately I happened to be right there and so pulled the plug. but what if it had happened on an auto-on cycle or when I wasn't home?! Never had a coffee machine do this before. In fact never even heard of one doing this, but a quick google search shows this is not an uncommon problem with the DCC series. Wish I'd known earlier, which is why I'm writing this review. If you buy this you are probably introducing a fire hazard into your home.On the plus side: it made good coffee prior to self-destructing."
1,Bad coffee maker,"I bought one of these and it lasted all of four months. Contacted Customer service and got a bad attitude. You have to pay to have a new one shipped to you, and pay to return the old one. After waiting two weeks I recieved a refurb that was busted up. I called customer service again and they blamed it on UPS although the box had no damage. This company does not care about repeat business, and takes an attitude if you ask them to do what is right. I did not in any way abuse or talk down to the customer service people, and when I asked to talk to a supervisor, I was transfered to Tech support, and no one was there at that time of day. I will never do business with this company again, and if you want to know more, do a search on the internet, see the customer complaints."
1,Cuisinart Coffee Maker Review,"I am unhappy with the following ""user interface"" features:1 - Water reservoir color (glossy black) does not provide enough contrast visually to enable easy and convenient pouring of water in low light conditions on my counter area.2 - Relatively small opening of water reservoir and its placement in the back corner makes pouring in water more difficult than it should be.3 - LED displaying time on front of unit is not lit and is impossible to read from more than 6"" away.All in all, unit is very inconvenient to use.I really would like to return the unit if possible.<[...]>"
2,Lacks longevity! Not priced as a disposable.,"This coffee pot shipped to us 3/1/11...we used it approximately 15 months and it worked well during that time. We didn't use it heavily, 1-2 pots/day, many days/weeks not used at all and yet it appears that the wiring burned up 3 days ago...funny sound, funny smell (not that of coffee). Now the lights come on but nothing happens. We'll see how good the 3 year warranty is.Update: The warranty service was great! I was required to pay shipping $10 for a new coffee maker w/ everything (pot, mesh filter, etc..) included. Was told to keep the existing carafe, filter, and basket. Also required to pay shipping ~$14.00 to ship faulty coffee maker. Not exactly a free warranty, but easy to accomplish. Hopefully this one lasts longer than 1 yr."
2,Nice look; horrible coffee,"After researching the Top Selling Coffee Makers on Amazon and other listings, I chose this Cuisinart because of the high ratings and sharp visual appeal. When I got the shipment, I went through all the preparations beforehand to insure we got a great cup of coffee. Was so disappointed in the first brew, and then the second, that I sent it back. The coffee tasted like medicine! Our water tastes good normally; I know if the water tastes good, so should the coffee--and we've always used Starbucks fresh beans. I'm going back to the Krups because I know it made a great tasting coffee, even though it can't compare in looks to the red Cuisinart. Maybe next time."
2,"Good coffee, but unreliable","I had my first Cuisinart coffee maker in 2008. It made great coffee, and I liked the programmable feature and automatic shutoff. It died (pump) in 2010. I replaced it with a Hamilton Beach unit, and the same thing happened..it died after about 11 months, and the coffee was okay, not great. So I went back to another Cuisinart, and it died about a month ago. Cuisinart makes great coffee, but the coffeemaker is unreliable. For the money I spent, I would think the coffeemaker would last longer. I'm making coffee the old fashioned way now; a melitta cone and filter. Yeah, I miss having the coffee already made when I get up, but I'm not going to buy another one."
2,Loved the coffee...pot lasted less than 12 months :( Stopped Brewing,"I purchased this coffee maker from here 10 months ago. I am the only coffee drinker in the house. Loved it, cleaned it and bragged about it all the time.It just stopped brewing! Now, I don't know what to do. I am to do a lot or research before I go spending that much on another coffee pot. :("
2,Longevity?,"We bought this coffee-maker at the end of June in 2010. This morning, 10/20/11, it did not work!!! Am I wrong to expect a coffee-maker to last more than a year? It's supposed to have a 3-year 'limited' warranty so I'm going to see exactly what that means. We were pretty happy with the pot other than it being hard to fill with water."
4,good but not great,"A few problems with this machine - hard to read the controls on the unit (very small), difficult to fill since the water goes in at the back of the machine, and mine drips onto the hotplate if you want a cup of coffee before it is finished brewing. That said it makes good coffee and has some options I like - you can set the time when the hot plate turns off, has a self-cleaning option, and has a water filter system. I've had mine for several years and am buying a second one for my office."
1,DCC-1200: Three units have failed - coincidence? I think not,"Today our third Cuisinart DCC-1200 totally failed. It will not brew coffee nor allow for self-clean. The coffeemaker had been leaking for quite some time so, quite frankly, I'm glad to see it go. When the first unit failed (out of warranty) I called Cuisinart and learned that the coffemaker is not repairable. Within warranty they just replace it. There are no repair parts available for out-of-warranty repair. The units seem to work for just under four years. The warranty is for three years. Yes, the DCC-1200 makes good coffee but it appears they are designed to fail. Our usage was just one pot of coffee a day, not exactly heavy usage. And yes, we cleaned/descaled it on a regular basis."
2,did not last 3 months,"Cone filter extracts best flavor with minimum change in concentration throughout brew cycle. Keep grind on course side of medium fine. Carafe absolutely NO DRIP. Filling very easy..just hang lip of carafe over edge of water res. and pour. Variable plate warm time,,excellent idea. Don't expect Amazon to combine orders to limit shipping cost."
4,Good buy.,"As advertised, this coffee maker looks good and makes coffee reliably good, whether you grind your own beans or use ground coffee. Additional features are useful. Easy clean up and looks good."
4,Decent coffee maker with a couple flaws,"I actually prefer an espresso coffee maker but my wife insisted on a model like this where she can make 12 cups at once for when her ladies club comes to our house. My personal opinion is that a drip coffee machine will NEVER taste as good as even the cheapest espresso maker but this Cuisineart does make an OK cup of coffee.A couple things that bother me: the buttons and knobs are made for people that love to decipher minute inscriptions, all others, especially baby boomer like me will have trouble. They are way to small and not really intuitive.When putting the gold filter and the other plastic gizmo back into the machine it is easy for those not to align properly and then the lid wont close.I usually make a big cup of coffee for myself using the 1-4 cup button but the coffee just isn't hot enough."
2,Save your money,"For the money you can do better. This thing has a few design flaws.1- Water and coffee go in from the top -- which is okay since I'm over 6 feet tall -- but my shorter wife practically needs a step to prepare it for use (she's 5'6"", hardly a midget). Baskets that swing out are much better. A coffee maker shouldn't require you to be tall.2- This basket always needs several nudges to get secured - also annoying. Again, the swing style is great.3- The ever-annoying spillage. Yes, I'm always mopping up coffee from the counter and floor. And when you remove the carfe, that annoying 'ppppppsssssssstttt' occurs from spillage on the hot plate, even though this shouldn't happen.For the money - these aren't acceptable flaws. I've had it for 2 months and am getting a Hamilton Beach. I'd sell the Cuisinart used - but wouldn't want anyone to get stuck with it. I'm going to give it wawy to my doorman -- and he'll no doubt throw it out."
2,Horable Pot,love the machine but the coffe pot could have being better. i am on my third replacement pot. tempered glass could have made this a very good coffee maker.
1,Another Failure,"DCC-1200 - 1 pot of coffee a day (minus some vacation and out of time time) for about 18 months and then it died. Brought out my mothers old Wearever percolator and made coffee the 'old school' way.While I agree on some of the positive points, I found filling to be a bit of a challenge and the hot plate on low was quite hot.We thought we had found our coffee maker after 2 other brands were bought and failed only to find the same problem with the ""highly rated"" Cuisinart.I sent Cuisinart customer service an email yesterday (11/12/12) and I am awaiting a response. I suspect there are many more customers in queue ahead of me.I may purchase an old Braun from Ebay. That was a great coffee maker. Thanks... Bob"
2,Does not last long with daily home use,Length:: 0:20 MinsDidn't last long for a device as simple as a coffee maker. I have repaired it twice - once to clean out a clogged valve and once to try to fix the switch which is the problem shown in this video. I have had a Cuisinart food processor for over 20 years and it still works great. I got the Cuisinart coffee maker after my last one died thinking Cuisinart knows how to design a product that gets used daily. Turns our I was wrong.
5,Fantastic Coffee Maker!,"Great coffee maker - don't hesitate to buy it. Both my parents & I have this model and they have been working fantastically for over 6 years! Our power company zapped mine & I had to get a new one; I bought the same model without hesitation! The gold filter is great and it really does make a great cup of coffee. Looks great too! I don't know why people had problems; we never did but maybe they got a refurbished one or the occasional lemon. Amazon always takes returns/exchanges though and like I said, we never had a single problem."
3,Things to know,"When I first got this coffee maker I rated it five stars and wrote:1. You don't need to order the gold-tone filter. One is included as are a few paper filters and one water filter (which won't need changing for six months.2. The lid of the carafe flips off from the back by using a thumbnail. I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to open the carafe, but was too tentative because I was afraid I'd break it before it started.3. They also include a coffee scoop (tablespoon measurement).Now that I've owned it there's one problem that's cropped up that has forced me to lower the rating. The brewing/heating element will randomly (and silently) turn itself off. Sometimes it's half-way through the brewing process, sometimes it's after that but not at any regular interval. Sometimes it stays on for the full two hours. It's made me start looking for another coffee maker."
5,Quality coffee maker,Have not purchased a coffee maker for 10 years...but getting this one makes me re-think the wisdom of that choice. This Cuisinart coffee maker brews great coffee and has all the features (short of self-filling) I could ever need...all at a reasonable price.
2,Doesn't hold up,"Worked well for about 14 months when the warmer went on the fritz and it would only make about 3/4 of a pot of coffee. This despite regular cleaning and maintenance; also I used only filtered water to make the coffee. I expect more for a coffeemaker that sells for $70 on sale. I'm switching to the Presto percolator. Better coffee and if something does go wrong, I can order the parts online and fix it myself."
1,Cuisinart DCC-1200 12 Cup Coffeemaker,"Have just received this machine, which I got from Amazon in the US, living outside US I forgot that we have different voltage {240VAC) against {120VAC} in the US.It went with a big bang when turned on,so unfortunately I can`t rate this machine, but just looking at it it looks a quality made machine, so if any one know where to purchase this machine in 240VAC I would like to know"
1,Garbage,"Like all other Cuisinart products I own, this is a waste of money. Every time I make coffee there is a puddle of water under the machine. The caraf is not designed to pour coffee-it spills on the counter every time. And unless there's a spotlight shining down the water tank or you're making 8 cups or more, it's very difficult to know how much water you are adding."
4,"Very Close to a ""5""","We used B---- Aromasters for the last 15 years because even for 4 times the money we couldn't get the coffee strong and rich enough to suit our taste. But they had design flaws that caused overflows and ruined pots of coffee occasionally - really annoying at 5 am.This coffee maker fills the bill without those annoyances. This maker gets 4 stars because I have to agree with the reviews that mention the water scale being difficult, the outside measure from the Aromasters is missed. And pouring the water requires some attention. Not big deals, but 5 stars means perfect.It is very attractive, and a little larger than many comparable if space is an issue for you. The maker also gives several control options, which results in several buttons and switches that might give me pause, but the machine has a 3 year warranty.We've had it for about 3 weeks. It wouldn't surprise me if we use it for at least 10 years. If anything changes I'll update."
5,Great Coffee. Consistent Brew.,"I highly recommend this unit for its consistently good brew and useful features. I've had this coffeemaker for 3 months now and it is also very easy to use and program, which is important. The timer is simple and although I could live without the end of brew cycle beeping, it isn't loud enough to wake the late sleepers in my house. The small batch brew setting is great too. Also, the fact that you can set the auto shutoff for any time increment is great. My old coffeemaker would always turn off the warming element in 20 minutes, which was terrible for parties or when guests are over. You can set this one for as long as you want. Cleanup is also mercifully easy. Although the unit is so air tight, you will want to prop the lid open just a bit to prevent moisture staying in the top. (I use a spoon. overall, a great coffeemaker for the money. Well worth it over the cheapo 30-40 dollar machines."
4,Cuisinart Brew Central,This is a very good coffee maker. The quality and features appear to be top notch. I like that it filters the water and has a reusable permanent coffee filter.
5,Pleased and properly caffeinated!,"I've been using this product most every morning for about four months, and it has performed very well. Like most coffeemakers, the quality of the coffee and the water, as well as accurate measurements of both, are very important. The instruction manual stresses these points. My only suggestion is to consider using a paper filter in place of or in addition to the included permanent filter. Cleanup will be easier, and the ""dregs"" at the bottom of the carafe will essentially disappear. A minor point- after a power failure, all settings are lost. Otherwise, it gets the job done, and looks pretty slick on the counter top."
2,Burns coffee,"I am buying my 2nd Cuisinart because the first one I had broke where the coffee dispensed out of and the metal carafe started to taste so stale that I had to get another one. From the advice of the store manager, he said that Cuisinart had improved their models. SO I bought another one. I have tried all kinds of good quality beans and for some reason I taste burnt coffee. The brewing process is burning the flavor of the beans. Other then that it's a great looking coffee maker."
1,Great coffee - crappy dependability,"We owned 3 of these coffee makers over the last two years. They all made great tasting coffee. The first one lasted 1 year, the second 6 months and the third one, a week.I don't know if Cuisinart has sold out to the lowest bidder - but they are ruining their brand name by manufacturing small appliances that don't last. We are saddened that we can't replace our coffeemaker with one that lives up to its name."
2,Can not brew more than 6 cups without overflowing the coffee grinds!,"ok...we have owned this over a year and it does make a good cup of coffee.The downside: The coffee make just can't handle over 6 cups of coffee without spilling the grinds everywhere. I should of listened to the reviews...to clean this thing with grinds everywhere is a disaster. It's likes a blow-out...for those that have little ones, you will know what I mean.The bottom line: The coffee make looks better than it functions. Going to look for another unit now. Later."
2,USED the warranty BIG TIME,"I bought this coffee maker 3 years ago, and it malfunctioned two times. The first time we returned it and received a new one from the company. This past time it just died one day, and when we returned it they said that it was now out of warranty, and that they had not received it yet. So, now I am looking to Consumer Reports for a new one. They rated this particular model VERY LOW. We enjoyed it when it worked, but will not buy it again due to reliability."
3,"Average taste, leaks daily!","This machine makes decent coffee but it does not taste as good as the coffee has with other machines. It is not as easy to fill with water as we would like, but that's OK too. The kicker is that after only 6 months of daily use it needs an overhaul of some kind- it leaks daily, all the coffee pouring all over. It's unstoppable, and we have cleaned it inside and out. We're searching for a new maker at this point. Definitely not a good buy for our money."
3,Good coffee but SLOW,"I agree with all the positives mentioned by other reviewers. My only complaint is that it takes a while to brew 12 cups. It takes me 10-15 mins to brew the whole pot. I realize I can use the programming feature, but I want a coffee maker that brews fast. I have cleaned the machine, so it's not clogged, etc. I think I will try the Bunn coffee makers, they boast 3 mins for a full pot. That sounds better. If you have time to wait, it's a great coffee maker, if you want your coffee right away, I would stay clear of this machine."
1,"makes great coffee, when it works.","Our third one just died this morning. Our first one lasted about 18 months, then Cuisinart replaced it with a refurb unit. That one lasted about as long. So we bought a third, because it has great features, makes good coffee and doesn't spill much when you pour. But today number three died. Still under warranty, so I will call for replacement, but will go out in the snow today to buy something else."
3,Mediocre Performance,"I am disappointed with the Cuisinart DCC-1200BCH Brew Central. While most features function as advertised, the brew-pause feature does not work. Our machine just continues dripping coffee once the carafe is removed. The appearance and general performance of this coffee maker match the description, but for $70, I expect the brew-pause feature to work as advertised."
2,Only lasted less than 2 years,"Bought this product 1 1/2 yrs .ago with very high hopes. Ranked good too, with Consumer Reports magazine. But it just stopped brewing just like that. Our coffee maker was kept in good condition, always cleaned after each use. Not sure what the problem is."
2,Just OK and then it stopped working,"Bought the Cuisinart coffee maker 1-1.5 yrs ago to replace one that we had for 15ish years. Today the Cuisinart died - talk about planned obsolescence! The electronics had been slowly dying for a few months. First the beep starting sounding sick, then the clock would get screwy every 24 hours, then the heater would shut off after brewing, finally the electronics stopped working completely. ~1/2 a pot a day for 1-1.5 years - soooo dissapointed.The one thing that bugged me since we bought it is the ""sweat"" leaking. Every time you open the lid all the condensation runs down the lid and down the back of the machine, leaving a puddle on my counter. Someone couldn't have seen that as a problem when they were designing/testing this?"
1,Failed after a year,"Worked ok, water does not poor nicely out of the pot if using it to fill the resevoir. The brew function quit working after about a year. It's not a switch problem it is in the elecronics. I can get it to work if I set the auto brew function and enter a time a minute in the future. Pain in the ass. Thought Cuisinart was a step up in quality, going back to Mr. Cofffe."
2,"Good coffee, bad design",This coffee maker makes very good coffee quickly but has a major design flaw. In order to fill the coffee maker with water it is necessary to lean over the opened lid to measure the amount of water. Unlike other coffee makers this has no fill window to indicate the water level.
2,Warning - no longer stainless steel!,"Having just purchased my third DCC-1200 in 20 years, I was disappointed to find that the classy brushed stainless steel housing has been replaced by cheap silvery plastic. Yet all of the product descriptions, not just on Amazon, but even on Cuisinart's own website, still describe it is as ""stainless."" A Cuisinart rep told me it was changed to plastic ""some years ago,"" although you may be able to still find a real stainless one in inventory somewhere. Also, the list price, as ordered direct from the manufacturer, is $79, not, as cited here, $145. The good news: it still makes good coffee, especially in smaller quantities, where other brewers fail."
5,It more than met my expectations!! Great coffee!!,"It was helpful to have so many positive/negative reviews available to help me make my decision. My new Cuisinart DCC-1200 makes great coffee and keeps it hot, which my previous coffeemaker did not do. To me the taste is what is most important and I find it user friendly."
2,Stops Brewing,"I would absolutely give this 5 stars except, every other time I use it, it stops brewing after one or two cups. (Yes I have it set for 12). I have to click the 'On' button again to make it restart the brewing process. Of course this did not happen during the window of opportunity to return the item."
2,You've got to be kidding me,"It IS pretty. However, you cannot read the dials without a flash light, since they are black on a dark blue background. So I have my flashlight right next to my coffeemaker so that I can use it."
4,Great coffee pot!,"We've had cuisinart coffee pot since the late 90's. Others never gave us hot coffee in the morning so we actually bought it cause it looked heavy duty. With age and alot of use over the years the switch is going on it so time for a new one and this brand I will again purchase! To our surprise colors available. Thats cool. But what I really want to state is, I love the timer. Great to get up in the morning and simply pour yourself a cup of coffee not having to wait. Setting it up is simple. Just pour the water with its cover you have no spillage then set up your coffe in the basket and set it on if you use auto."
5,Cuisinart 12 cup programmable coffeemaker,"This is the second Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker that we have purchased. The other one was approx. 10yrs old & still worked, but we wanted to purchase another Cuisinart coffee maker. We had been very happy with our other coffee maker & the new one is fantastic. The item was sent to us in record time & the packaging was fantastic. BP."
4,New Best Friend,Great coffee maker. Flaws such as hidden water gauge were well documented with other reviews. The temp gauge apparently only pertains to the hot pad as the coffee is not hotter at time of delivery than other coffee makers.
2,after 18 months.....,"This coffeemaker lasted 18 months. I knew it was dying when it started getting noisier & we couldn't change the default for the number of hours the coffee maker stayed on. This AM nothing, no coffee, no power, just dead. 18 months and now nothing. After reading the reviews again (which I did before purchasing) & also reading the ongoing conversation,this is a common problem. Apparently the older coffeemakers last 5 years or more. Those were probably the last manufactured in this country. What a disgrace! I'm brewing my morning coffee in a 30 cup West Bend that my mother had for 30+ years. And it still works. I think we're going to opt for a Bunn commercial maker & stop this craziness. I'm not willing to spend at least $20. to get the cuisinart repaired.P.S. The cuisinart did make great coffee."
4,Good coffee but why is it spilling itself over?,"Coffee tastes great - good price, and I think it does a good job. been serving me daily for 6 months.but when making coffee it appears to run over the sides of the pot, and runs down the sides of the pot, and burns on the bottom heater plate. I've tried jostling it around getting it into the right spot, but no dice it still does it.Anyone had luck fixing this?"
1,quality and workmanship very poor,I bought the Cuisinart based on the reviews on Amazon and the price. You get what you pay for. It brews a nice cup of coffee but the top is loose. You can push it down after loading the coffee and it works. I saw the same item at Kohl's for $30 more but at least theirs wasn't broken.Review part II. Coffee maker stopped working 22 months after purchase.
5,"GREAT, GREAT HANDEL!","This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo ""Ombra mai fu,"" but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight."
3,Serse a mixed blessing,"Nicolas McGegan leads a spritely performance of this late Handel opera. The countertenor, Asawa, is excellent as are Milne, Bickley and Ely. In the comic role sounds like an actor who is singing. Though billed as a bass, his voice lacks resonance and depth. The biggest problems, however, are the two leads. Smith sounds like someone who is close to the end of a nice career. She is ready for seconda donna roles...too old for Romilda. In the title role Malafronte is inadaquate. She seems incapable of shaping a phrase musically. Her ""Ombra mai fu"" sounds amateurish. She is somewhat better in the more dramatic sections where she has to fill out the voice more but the all important matter of shaping the phrases is still absent. Many have praised this recording but I found it dissapointing because of the reasons above."
1,Don't sit in this chair,I purchased two Global Distinctions Widson Armchairs along with four side chairs. I have now spent two weeks and six telephone calls to Amazon to return these very poor products. I would have felt unsafe allowing my three-year-old grandson sit in these very unstable chairs. The quality was very poor.
4,Very Soothing,"This is a lovely, light and airy meditative aid. As in all of Monroe Products, it contains the hemi-sync wave technology that uses blended and sequenced sound patterns which can lead you into a focused, ""whole-brain"" state of consciousness.It is also good as ""background"" music for daily work, although it can become innocuous and repetitive -- but that is probably also why it is effective."
3,Wasn't what I expected ...,"One of the best and underated metal band of all time... I wasn't too happy with the song lineup.. There could of been a bunch more tunes added.. Eric AK can still sing and hit the high notes (dont believe the other review) but he obviously is not ""into"" the show and actually seems to be bored with it. Thats just the impression I get. I just wish these guys would find a decent label that will give them the proper exposure because all of their albums are great.. I wasn't much into the last 2 too much but hopefully their upcoming album (Dreams Of Death) will give them the proper exposure they deserve."
1,"average, the band seemed tired",Flotsam seem to have lost what little they had on this dvd. A tired average metal band.
1,Save your money...,"Don't bother buying this unless your into watching a bunch of old has-beens trying to be young. Vocalist Eric AK can't hit any of the high notes and the whole sound in general is horrible. To add insult to injury, the documentary was pointless and I'm not sure why it had to be put out on two separate DVD's. These guys need to get a clue and call it quits."
3,Not bad,"This single could've been much better, especially If they'd removed the mixes by Die Warzu, which upset the flow of the disc. Nine Inch Nails contributes an okay mix, but the real gems are the ones by Vince Lawrence, Excessive Force, and KMFDM. Overall an unbalanced single."
1,Boring,"Do not let the Trent Reznor fans steer you wrong! Nine of the same song really is quite boring. In fact the Fat Back Dub, you will love it the first time you hear, it, but then not after that. This is a very simple release and if you love variety, then get it, but if not the single is only nine remixes of the same song."
3,Anti-Racism Lite,"I was aorund in the '70s when, if you were white, you were expected to admit your quilt as a racist -- not so unrealistic -- so a great deal of Barndt's wriring is old stuff for me. He also has occasion to exgerate a bit. (No, Rev. Barndt, the Isrealites did NOT rise up against the Egyptions -- God stepped in. That should be enough to get our attention on it's own.)Also, in the eight books on the subject which I have purchased in the last six months I find few suggestions on what _I_ can do to help.If you are new to the discussion of Racism then the book has value. It would also serve well as a tool for discussion.Bear in mind that I am...The Cynic.PS, if you want to read an excellent account of the state of afaires at the previous turn of the century (1899->1900) I highly recomment W.E.B. DuBois' ""The Soul of Black Folks"""
5,Very Solid!,"This is arguably KJ's best cd. From start to finish, this cd is very solid. He has great beats, good lyrics, some of his songs are serious, some are silly, and anyone can listen to this cd and love it. In fact, my copy is so worn out that i will have to purchase a new copy soon. If someone has told you to buy just one kj-52 cd, make it this one, this is definitely the best one to start with."
3,don't understand,"How can that other guy thinks "" this is the greatesr rap cd ever"" if its the first one he ever bought???"
2,Understandable,"Alright, they guy has some talent. And all props to him that he respect god. But when rappers bring up someone in a song, it's to rib them not convert them. I don't like the whole god thing because i am not religious, and it just seems like another...attempt by god people (for lack of better word without foul language)to get people to pay attention to them."
5,LOVE THAT KJ HAS FOR GOD,"THE MESSAGE THAT KJ HAS THROUGH HIS MUSIC IS THE GREATEST. IF YOU LIKE ANY KIND OF RAP OR R&B, I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE THIS. TRY IT OUT SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT AND LET EVERYONE KNOW. HE WONT LET YOU DOWN. ONE MORE THING, IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT, GO FOR IT!"
3,It's good!,This Cd is good. He is a funny guy! I didn't think mullet pride was funny though. I thought it was jus stupid but it's a preety good cd. Remixed is better & 7th Avenue. I heard that his new album The Yearbook is hott.
5,"You, Me & A Redhead...","...the `02 release by one of the most unique singer-songwriters on the Boston music scene. Combining elements of country (""What's A Lonesome Girl To Do"") and blues (""Don't Tell Me"") with stark, honest, and sometimes quirky lyrics (""Battle Row""), this album is reminiscent of early Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, and even Patsy Cline. (Check out the Patsy Cline-inspired vocals on ""Daddy Don't Fall Down."") In an age when country music is a mere half step away from pop drivel, this album is a revelation -- and something that no fan of country music should be without. (As a sidenote, if you have an opportunity to see Kerri Powers live, take advantage of it while she's still playing small venues. I finally had a chance to see her perform earlier this year and was completely blown away. The new songs she played will undoubtedly make another great album at some point as well!)"
3,"Good, sort of","I bought these to use as under-shelf lighting for bookshelves I use for craft shows. The Dots DO provide light, and the battery seems to last forever (I used them for HOURS) but weren't as bright as needed them to be. That said, I only tried them out in the above instance, and not in any other, so they may be perfect for dark closets, etc. They did burn very brightly when accidently turned on in my empty Totes box!The sticky tape on the back is VERY sticky, so do NOT put these on anything with a coating. I had to repaint my black shelves when I took them off."
4,Nice puck light,"Pros:-No WIRES-Look pleasingly nice and cute.-Battery last a long time.-You can stick it anywhere you want, great for those odd places where it is impossible to put a regular light.-Great momentary night light-Simple operation. Just tap it on and off.Cons:-Not a lot of light. Just enough so you can see where you are going.-Ghostly color of light. Hard to recognize colors of things that is lit."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting more light than these provide. Certainly not enough to use under a counter for extra lighting. They are OK if you have a small dark cupboard, but not for a very large area."
1,Mood lighting at best,"The description of this product is NOT accurate. These lights are NOT bright. I have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light. It is a pretty color of light, but very dim."
1,LED Lighting Not Satisfactory,"We were trying to get rid of the wires for under the cabinet lighting. However, the LED lights were definitely NOT sufficient for this area. We were very disappointed even after trying to double the number recommended in an area."
4,Mrs.,My daughter has one and toldme how great and useful it isfor differenct occasions.I use this for evenings outto put my wine in. I have itchilled and it will keep forthe evening. It is great forsnacks and bottled water fortrips.
5,Fantastic and useful!,"We purchased the Picnic Time Duet Tote for our daughter and her boyfriend. We sent it to them with a loaf of bread, a bottle of wine, and a book of verse (as well as two serviettes and a small tablecloth) - all tucked neatly into the bag!They were very tickled with the gift, and look forward to using it come Summer.The construction of the bag is most excellent, and it is quite attractive. We plan to use the same idea for wedding and anniversary gifts this year."
5,Excellent Christmas gift,"Excellent Christmas gift for those couples that have everything! Package arrived on time, when expected, and packed very well"
5,Exactly as described,Great quality wine carrier! Perfect for picnic outtings or for toting some wine to a gathering with friends! The included tools are also of good quality.....a perfect gift for a wine lover!
3,Could have been better if digitally mastered,"The picture was a bit too grainy and indistinct for full enjoyment (judged aagainst newer DVDs, please don't think that the quality is so ""bad"" as to be unwatchable, it just could be much better). The quality of the 10 year-old VHS that I borrowed from the library was hardly worse.The musical tracks are very good and the images of Vermont are wonderful. They deserve better treatment.Windham Hill, please digitally re-master this (preferably in 5.1) and I would be willing to plunk down the purchase price all over again.As it stands, buy it and enjoy it as unfortunately, this is the only way we can enjoy this wonderful collection (at least for now)."
3,Beautiful nature and good music,"I ordered this DVD mostly for sentimental reasons. I had this Windham Hill/Laserdisc production on VHS when my boys were little in the '80's. Then the tapes disappeared. This seems to happen on a regular basis around here. I really wanted to replace these tapes, and was surprised to find them on DVD. Even though reviews indicated that the ports from VHS to DVD weren't very good, I still wanted to re-experience Autumn Portrait and Winter. I have no complaints about Autumn Portrait at about $10. I'm happy to have it again."
1,Windam Hill music video,"The sound tracks are pleasant and typical of Windham Hill; reason enough for purchasing. However, I have been profoundly disappointed with the DVD product. I was originally acquainted with the Laser Disc releases in the late 1980s and remembered them as visually stunning. However, the quality of video imagery on the DVD version is very poor resolution and not at all comparable to what is shown on the cover. Unfortunately there is better satisfaction from CD versions without distracting video."
2,Six wives of Henry 8th Anne Boleyn was NOT very good,I have seen various versions and this was the poorest ever viewed.script and actors were not what I expected.
5,This is the book to buy,In the last 25 years I've made about 50 trips to Baja so I think I know a little bit about the place. After reading The Baja Adventure Book I realised how little I do know about Baja- this book has lots of great information for the newcomer to Baja or for the seasoned traveler and is my first recommendation for a book on Baja. My second recommendation would be to pick up a copy of The Baja Catch by Kelly and Kira.
3,Just ok,"I purchased this book and a couple others to prep for a 2 week roadtrip throughout the peninsula. As another reviewer mentioned, a lot of this information is outdated, especially road information. Much of the author's stories do not reflect the reality that even in Baja, roads have improved, degraded, built, or overgrown.For a person looking for more up to date information on the peninsula, you could do better with a guidebook such as Moon."
5,GREAT AAA AND AA BATTERY CHARGER,GREAT AA AND AAA BATTERY CHARGER. THEY ARE HARD TO FIND BUT IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF RECHARGING BATTERIES.
5,what's not to love?,"As we started to accumulate kitchen utensils and gadgets, we ran out of drawer space (I'm sure many of you can relate). Well, this crock can easily free up an entire drawer all by itself. It measures about 6 inches high, just under 7 inches across the top, and 1/4 inch thick. It's very sturdy... after a half year of clanging utensils and gadgets in and out of it, not one ding or chip. Just FYI, ""Le Creuset"" is stamped into the bottom, and appears in raised letters on the side of the crock. NOTE: we bought the kiwi green to match our kiwi green Le Creuset dutch oven... the kiwi green of the crock is a bit darker/more muted than the kiwi green of the dutch oven, but still a great match."
5,Great Le Creuset item,I purchased this item for my daughter who is collecting Le Creuset in the Kiwi color. She loves this item as well as all her other items because they are not only beautiful but functional. This item sits on her countertop and holds her utensils but looks pretty and cheerful at the same time. Amazon has amazing prices on the Le Creuset items and none of the items I purchased appear to be of any different quality than the items I see in my local shops. This item came well packaged with no damage. I will continue to shop Amazon for additional pieces from this line.
4,Attractive and sturdy,"This Utensil Crock lives up to the Le Creuset standard of quality. The Kiwi color I purchased is vibrant and attractive. The item is shorter than I envisioned it, but still very sturdy. I can fit about 15 utensils in it. If you are looking to jazz up your counter tops, I would recommend this purchase."
4,"Not an ISP decimator, but still great.","Granted an ISP Decimator does work better in very high gain and high volume senarios, the Boss NS-2 still does an excelent job and is a much cheaper option. It eliminates anoying back ground hissing and humming when you have your amp cranked.The decay knob is great for controling how quickly you want the suppressor to engage again. If you play any style that does not have utilize ultra high gain guitars, I am sure this will solve your feed back problems. I play live in a heavy metal band at high volume and have no feedback problems with this pedal."
5,Boss Noise Suppressor,It really does its job.You only have to take your time to correctly program the two parameters to your instrument and playing style.
4,Boss NS-2 Review,Works great. Eliminates virtually all unwanted noise. If you have doubts about Noise suppressor this is the one to buy; it will amaze you if you are using it for the first time. (9V Adaptor Not Included)
4,Good but no color variety,"These seem to be cute and well-made. My only complain it that I ordered 4 and they all came in the same color (yellow). Statistically, I expected at least one other color! It makes for a boring assortment."
3,Pretty indulgent tone all the way through but has a nice...,"ending. I found myself rolling my eyes at the way this writer described things- she seems to need to go over the top on things that just don't deserve it but I left it feeling like I had known a couple of the characters at one point in my life. If this is who they were, I'm kinda glad I don't hang out with them anymore even though they shaped me beyond repair."
5,A wonderful way to learn through entertainment,"I watched this DVD with my two sons, ages 4 years and 6 mos. My younger son was entertained by the Starlets and I even caught him laughing when something on the screen delighted him. (Incidentally, I've tried a Baby Einstein or two with both my babies and they never seemed to enjoy them. So I was so pleasantly surprised to see the positive reaction with Fundamentals.) My 4 year old son was equally entranced with the DVD and watched it 3x in one sitting. He is working at preschool on putting concepts together (two red cars, three blue carts, etc.) and having that reiterated was very interesting to him.I think that this is a terrific DVD for kiddos to learn in so many ways. The sing-song repetition and the friendly narrator are inviting as well so the kids stick with it and inevitably learn through this unique method. I highly recommend this DVD to help children understand more about this wonderful world of ours."
2,There is So Much Better Out There,"Based on the reviews, I purchased this DVD and was really diappointed. Like a lot of the reviews I felt that my son was getting a little beyond the Baby Einstein DVDs. This DVD is really unpolished and the women in the upper left hand corner is really distracting for my son. Additionally, the pace is a bit fast. By this I mean that the woman in the upper left hand corner of the screen repeats what's going on in the screen but she does it really fast and the item in the main screen is flashed. I'm pretty quick, but watching the DVD with my child I though the items were flashing quickly so I can only imagine that my child wasn't getting it either. Five minutes into it, my son got up and left. Such a disappointment and a waste of money. The preschool prep DVDs are so much better, but unfortunately there are only 3 of them (shapes, numbers and letters)."
4,Fundamentals,Great Video has a variation and teach several things just the woman is speaking too fast. But my child like it.
2,Disappointed !!,"This was supposed to be a 'new' 4 dvd set. I received a set that appears to have varying degrees of wear. One is shrinkwrapped, one disc has scratches on it. The box is dented and torn. I paid $ 99.00 for this in hopes of giving it to my mother in law as a Christmas gift. I'll not be able to do so, as it would be embarassing to present this to someone."
2,Not the footage I was looking for,I purchased this box set thinking it was going to contain all the late sixties music. It contained a lot of stuff which I didn't care about and only contained about 15% of what I liked. If you want to get a good Sullivan video look for the Ed Sullivan's Rock n Roll Classics series.
3,There are better books about families.,Very similar to the other book we read by Ms. Morris. It even has some of the same pictures. I felt it was not as good as other books we read by her. Shows pictures of families with very little text. I would recommend it for Kindergarten and below.
5,Delightfully Fun & Expressive!!!,"Each virtuosos in their own right, Paula Robison and company have done an incredible job in this wonderful collection of music for all to enjoy.The performances featured on this album are perfect for classically trained flutists, world music fans, or any music lover to enjoy. From the 'swing' of ""Rio Nights"" (track 3) to the most expressive and beautiful piccolo solos of ""Bem-te-vi"" (track 8), this album radiates such an organic, tasteful, and fun loving energy that it is truly rewarding to listen to.If you find that you like this recording - you might also research their first album together: BrasileirinhoEnjoy!"
3,Read the rest of them first...,"I always thought this was the lamest one in the series. The plot and the entire tone are so goody two-shoes - straight outta ""Leave it to Beaver"". No Mrs. Graymalkin in this one, either - she provided the slightly subversive undertones that were the best part..."
3,money for the masses,"Money is one of my top 10 favorite KMFDM songs. This single is from their album of the same name. It's a good single but the remixes of the other song ""Bargeld"" aren't all that different, but the Money tracks are all pretty good. Definitely pick this up if you are a KMFDM fan or if you are just discovering them."
4,Research Needs for Extreme Floods Analysis,"This book focuses on the existing approaches for estimating extreme flood probabilities, assessing and identifying preferred methods for flood estimation to be further explored and to identifying research that can be expected to improve our ability to estimate flood magnitudes and its probabilities. A team of a dozen top experts (Cohon, Baker, Boes, Cornell, Crawford, Hudlow, Kirby, Newton, Potter, Wallis, and Yakowitz) has produced a very nice and compact book (141 pages) with their opinions. The developmental issues and research needs as outlined in the concluding chapter include: regionalization of floods, runoff modeling (generating runoff distributions with the runoff model via rainfall distributions and comparing it with the measured runoff), and data considerations. I found the book extremely interesting and I wished I had read it 10 years ago..."
1,Does not work with KRZR K1m,"Why would you advertise a OEM Stereo Hands-Free Headset for the KRZR K1m when it doesn't even work with the phone. I feel extremely ripped off when I order this product, got it, just to found it it doesn't work and when you look around the web it seems like everybody else is having the same problems."
3,for little hands,"I did not realize this came already inflated. I assumed it would be like the others I have ordered, where you have the option to deflate and inflate when needed. It is small and easy for little hand to grab. It will get lots of use in the household I purchased it for."
4,"Fantastic song, but versions are almost identical.","This song is the best KMFDM song I have heard (although I have only really heard their older albums). It is hyper-fast and hyper-hard and guaranteed to get the adrenaline running. Be careful though, the real audio links above seem to be linked to some other record. However, you don't get much value for your money. The first two tracks are almost identical. My favorite KMFDM single has to be Light (song not as good, but mixes are diverse, and very good)."
3,Useful if you have an old drive,"Some older drives -- and older in this context could be as little as five years -- have problems reading R/RW media rated for speeds higher than were current when they were made. I tired of burning DVD-R's to play in my Oppo player, so I thought I'd give RW a try to save $ and waste when I ran out of DVD-R media. My player had become picky wrt DVD-R's, and this old-stock item wasn't any different. I gave up and eventually won spousal permission to get a Boxee Box instead, which works beautifully and has saved me countless hours of hassle and units of karma.Basically, optical media are rapidly becoming a thing of the past, and 4x media especially so. This is the disc for you only if you have very specific needs."
2,blank dvds,"Received this item in a timely manner, however, it won't record movies from the cable premium channels due to copyright protection.Works great recording movies from Turner Classic Movies channel. Paid too much for that, won't buy these again. Could have spent lesson Sony DVD-RW blank discs."
2,Disappointing,"Thurman's voice gave me a headache. He screamed as if he was drunk. I disliked his sense of humour, his vocabulary and the content of his lecture. I did not learn much about the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Certainly not what I expected from an academician of his calibre."
2,Seat Cover,The cover has less padding then I expected compared to the cover I purchased for my other ATV.It is difficult to find a good cover that is not Camoflage of some sort. Seems most ATV accessory makes thinkATV's are only ridden by people who huntIt will do the job to protect the seat of the ATV from scuffs as you get on and off and it reasonably fits my Arctic Cat seat. I only gave it 2 stars because of the padding or lack of.
2,Review of seat cover,Did not come even close to fitting my atv seat. It was way too big and had overlap. I had to send it back.
4,Yeah...awesome,"I got nothing to say really...except I just listened to my LP of this and thought, man, it's too bad this is such an unknown gem, so I should go write a review of appreciation on amazon. I would describe it, but hey, you've got sound clips above you there! Use em. And if you like Unrest, this is probably the best offshoot, and I'm including Grenadine and Air Miami, which are better known, but not as simple and perfect. This was a great live show, too. Wish I had an Olympic Death Squad t-shirt."
4,Epic Low Budget Fun,"""Rat Scratch Fever"" is an micro-budget epic. It's has explosions and action galore. Does it show its' budget at times? Heck yeah, but you have to enjoy its' ambition even it doesn't always reach it's production value goal."
4,Excellent reference book,"I got this because I want to write medieval historicals and needed to know what people ate. This book gives a very good overview of foods available, how they were eaten, table manners, etc.; I just wish it went into just a little more detail. But that's not really what it's about; it's for presenting actual medieval recipes, and it certainly does give a lot of them with modern equivalents.But what did people eat for breakfast? How widespread was corn or oats? What other kinds of grains were used? What were sub-regional specialties? How much was wine thinned with water? How long could a wine last in those days before it went bad? How often did people get food poisoning?For what this book was written for, it's an excellent one. For a writer, it's a very good starting point."
1,Alert 450R,"Found this in my past purchases history, but could not find it being sold any longer by Amazon, but here goes anyway. Purchased this product in late Dec. 08, had it installed by a company that installs remote starters, alarms, car stereos, etc. 3 days later, one of the 2 remote key fobs shot craps, was told over the phone by a rep. from the company handling warranty work for Alert that ""no problem"" we'll send you a new one. Do you want the old one back? ""No, throw it away, that's what we'll just do with it"" That was a month ago, Im still waiting, meanwhile, the other key fob is retiring from service as I write this. Keep this in mind when purchasing anything from this company. The owner of the alarm company also told me that Alert products are made by Audiovox, keep that in mind also."
1,Worst dish soap ever.,"We bought this soap at our local store because we had a coupon and because it had an interesting package. What a mistake. It doesn't lather at all, and you have to use SO MUCH of it to even get your dishes clean. It claims to be ultra concentrated, but if it is, it's concentrated something-other-than-soap. Don't waste your money. It's not bad as a hand soap, but don't bother using it for dishes. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
2,"Overrated, overrated, overrated.","This is a good example of a well marketed product. It seem like every ""modern"" person got to have his copy of this book, called sometimes ""the bible of style"". I think is more a ""pastiche"" of interesting things, sometimes good things, but pointless and looong. And my version (uk) is so bad printed it makes me wonder for what have I paid 40 pounds on it.Just like the other ""S,M,L,XL"" with the also overrated work of the overrated ""modern"" architect Rem Koolhaas, this is just a beautiful object. But hey, I wanted a book!"
3,Good intro,"The guys from IBG (International Biometrics Group) did their best to create an introduction to biometrics and their applications.I'd say they did a reasonable job. There's not many books out there, so if you want to dip your toes in the biometric waters, this might be a good place."
2,"Good for beginners, NOT good for everyone","This books is for IT novices. It is NOT for engineers. If you want a book that gives a high level overview, this book is OK for that. If you want technical details about how the technology works, this book is not for you."
2,"Good for beginners, NOT good for everyone","This book benefits from the fact that the field of biometrics is new and immature, with very few published books that explain the technology from a laypersons point of view.This book is written for IT novices. It is NOT written for engineers. People that are interested in deeply technical descriptions of how the technologies work will be disappointed by this book. It is as simple as that."
2,Mixed bag of 90's recordings,"Buyer beware. The title, ""Albion Sunrise"" is misleading. I bought it expecting an anthology of the Albion's entire career, from the mid-70's forward. I was very disappointed to find that this was not the case. It is, in fact, a collection of songs from the group's none too illustrious lineup from the 1990's. No Richard Thompson, no Cathy LeSurf, very little Simon Nichole, no Martin Carthy....what's the point, really? To hear Ashley play bass? Not very interesting IMHO.The album is not bad but it's not very good either. It has it's high points but it has a lot of mediocre spots as well, some bordering on the outright ludicrous. If you're looking for a collection of classic British folk/rock, look elsewhere."
1,disappointed,"I am disappointed with this ironing board cover. The velcro straps are too short to fit across the bottom of the board. In the picture the pattern looks as if it is blue and white but there is also yellow in the design which is so faded it looks like water stains. I had hoped for a fresh, pretty cover but one is not."
2,Whitney Design Ultra Ironing Board Cover Review,"I was disappointed with this product. In the online photo, it showed a dangling side-pocket for ironing accessories, but the one I received did not have that benefit. Also, the ironing board cover is actually too small for the ironing board and does not fully cover the sides. I would not buy this product again, had I known."
4,Nice Ironing Board Cover,"I'm very pleased with this ironing board cover. It fits my older 15"" x 54"" board very well. It has 2 velcro straps to pull it tight underneath the board. It has a pocket that hangs down on one side to hold starch, spray bottle, etc. I don't use this and find it to be somewhat in the way. The padding is of very nice quality. I would have preferred a more attractive appearance, but it perfoms well."
4,Huge price drop right after I bought it.,"I just bought this and came to write a review, only to find the price had dropped by over a third since I bought it! Oh well, I still like the pretty pattern and it even has a little attached bag that can hold your ... well, I'm not sure what it's supposed to hold, lol, but it's there if you need it. One of the other reviewers mentioned the pale yellow color that doesn't show up well in the picture. That's true, but I personally wasn't bothered by it. It has a nice thickness and fits the ironing board snugly, and is secured by two velcro straps. For the current price, it's quite a bargain. Wish I would have waited a few days!"
1,Shipping too high,"I haven't received this product yet, but I am very upset at the shipping cost. I didn't realize until after I had already checked out that I had paid close to $12 to ship this $15 item!!! (I had multiple purchases going to multiple addresses, and couldn't see the breakdown until the transaction was complete.) As this is an Amazon Marketplace purchase, I don't think I can cancel or change the order at this point. This ironing board cover had better be FANTASTIC, because I just paid an outrageous shipping price for a simple household item. Grrrrr."
5,great book about routing policy,"You cannot find other books have so much infomation about real network description on routing policy. Like IS-IS L2-L1 route leaking, you cannot find so detailed information on other books."
4,chemical peel at home,Pretty good product as long as you keep using it on a regular basis. Its keen to the chemical peel at the dermatologist office. My dermatologist said it was working well.
5,shoe,My husband said he wore them all day the first day he got them. He loves Ecco and they really are worth the extra money.
5,Outstanding shoes,"These are the most comfortable dress shoes I've ever worn, and this is the best price I've ever seen. Highly recomment them!"
2,Learn The Correct Dates,I was reading over the back cover of this book and I realized that hey have Kurt listed as dying in 1995 instead of 1994. It may have just been a typo but it still makes me a little uneasy about the book.
4,It Must Be the Hair,"This ""work out"" DVD is one of many by Lenny M. He knows his stuff. But it just doesn't come across as well as say the Magpul series of training DVDs. Maybe it's his hair. Or the California outfits? I keep buying his training DVDs, but I find myself distracted> He might come across better if he wore tactical gear."
3,I like this DVD and if you like Nina you will too,"I like this DVD because I love seeing Nina when she was young and free! She seem to be enjoying her new life in France, and the French people seem to love her. To think,she was just getting started and the best was still to come!"
1,Lousy,"This is one of the crumbiest DVDs imaginable.It's hard to imagine that Nina Simone could be this mean and terrible, hence I was very surprised to witness this debacle. I'm also surprised that anyone thought it worthy of reproduction, much less the extraordinary bad taste to present it for sale.Nina Simone - Live"
5,Best I've found.,"I went searching through the library for a book to help with my software engineering class project and eventually found Java and Object Orientation. All I've got to say is this book is incredible. The writing is clear and to the point. Example code turned out to very helpful (and useful). This book really helped to understand not only how to design good object-oriented programs, but also how to design a good object-oriented GUI. I recommend it to any computer science student or professional in search of a good book on Java and OO design and programming."
4,Minor soul-blues classic,"This reissue of the 1969 classic is, for the most part, a modest soul-blues gem, with all of the rough edges intact and some strong originals by Covay (especially the 7-minute title track) to go along with a handful of solid cover versions. Unfortunately, the producer allowed someone to play something that sounds like a misguided attempt at blues flute on a few of the cuts. But at least now I know who Mick Jagger has been trying to imitate all these years."
3,"not bad, but let's dial back the hype","this work is solid, beautiful, and thoughtful, but if you are interested in this kind of work you should first get Eggleston's Guide, Stephen Shore's ""Uncommon Places,"" and especially Joel Sternfeld's ""American Prospects"" which this book seems to pick up from. but in all honesty, those books are not only better, groundbreaking (this is not groundbreaking work), and significant in an art/photo history context, they did so 30 years ago at a time when color photography was still seen as nothing to be taken seriously.so, buy this book, but only after the others. this is 'friends', go buy seinfeld first."
5,Spiritual-humanistic-atemporal book,"Following the path of Sternfeld and Eggleston, Alec Soth achieves originality, honesty and identity. If you associate this great photography with a superb printing quality (remember it's a Steidl edition), you get a marvelous art object.[...]"
3,worthy subject,"The Mississippi is as american as it gets, and has never been explored photographically in quite this intimate a way. The book is good, but not as good as some other books out there in this genre of large format color american road pictures. Seek deeper."
5,A Great Debut,"Stewart O'Nan is right to compare Arvin's work to early TC Boyle. There is a searching intelligence behind these stories, a concern for where ""progress"" takes people. I especially enjoyed the title story and 'Commemorating.' 'Take Your Child to Work' is heartbreaking. 'Telescope' is probably the most cool short-short I've read in years. It's an impressive collection."
1,Worst paper tape,"Don't buy this tape if you can find an alternative. This paper doesn't stick to itself well at all and as soon as you put your finger on it, the adhesive is much less effective. Nexcare is much better. I found one in the Bahamas which is my favorite but I can't recall the brand! :-("
2,"Captures the ""emotion"" of kicking a habit...","or so I imagine. I thought for a moment this ""single"" business would produce an industrial sell-out (which is all I can stand), but much to my disappointment, this can make one's ears bleed just as well as any. As a rule, if you're going to release an industrial/electronic single (which becomes an obligatory maxi-single), why not include some b-sides and fill it past this 22-minutes? Most of the remixes just up the repetition of ""she's my addiction"" or phase out the verses entirely. Hardly essential."
2,Chew Toy? for Gerbs,"The two Gerbs (gerbils) took care of this in a matter of a couple weeks. Why can't they make something unchewable????I won't buy another one, my Gerbs like to make their own burrows anyway."
2,not the right size,"O.K. So my pet rat Jelly Bean might be on the ""husky"" side, but he couldn't fit into this igloo even if I put him on a carb free diet! Even when i turned the igloo upside down and sat him in it, he filled the entire structure up completely! (There is even a picture of a rat on this sized igloo) The idea of the igloo sounds good so i am going to order the Large one because he does love his hammock!"
2,rockin out with Black Francis,"Where has the spark gone? The 1st 2 solo albums of Frank Black, where phenominal, edgy, and full of wonder. But this album is straight rock, which has been done a 1000 times over. Sure the recording method is new, and unique (live and on a 2 track thingamabob) but it still can't find that spark his music used to carry. The only track I could grove to was ""suffering"" but even that song seemed like a cheap imitation of Iggy Pop Moral of the story: Frank needs his diversity (ie. kim deal) for the tunes to really work out"
5,Possibly the best FB album ever!,"Along with 'Black Letter Days', this is by far my favorite Frank Black album, and is crammed to the brim with absolute classics. Buy it now.There's not a bad, or even a mediocre song on here. While I found 'Pistolero'for instance to be more plodding, and FB's earlier (self titled, Teenager of the year) to be more poppy, this album strikes the absolute perfect balance. The fact that it was recorded live only makes it all the more amazing."
5,Black is better than ever!,"Unlike many Frank Black fans, I found his first solo album mediocre. Teenager of the Year was a little better, and Cult of Ray was better than that. When FBATC was released, I thought that it was going to be like the rest: just okay. Not so. From the opening ""Green Acres"" riff to the mumbled ""better not..."" at the end, this album is outstanding. You can actually hear Frank's guitar this time (unlike half of Cult of Ray), and his vo cals are the most energetic we've heard in years. Frank redefined modern rock as it is with the Pixies, and this album deep-sixes about almost every other ""Alternative"" album that's come out this year. This is a must buy for anyone that likes guitars (check out Lyle's lead parts: they left me drooling!), or rock in general."
5,One of Franks best...,"Lately Frank Black in 2006 has ups and downs. His latest solo work is much more laid back and his voice has evolved greatly over time. But back in 1998 when he first joined up with the Catholics, he was still a force in alternative rock.With this release he really distances himself from his prior band, Pixies. Here the sound is more 'down-home' and incorporates a little country swagger, but nothing like his current rock-country albums.Overall, a step foward in the career of a man whose every changing style is the greatest in REAL alternative rock."
2,fan from Ann Arbor,"Even though there are a few catchy tunes, ""Back To Rome"", ""King And Queen Of Siam"", as well as ""Route Six Sixty Six,"" I felt the cd didn't have the ""creative rawness"" that Franks first to cds- Frank Black and especially Teenager Of The Year had."
2,Not packed very well.,It arrived in time...with a few small dents around the edges. The wood is soft and it gets dented easily. I will get my use out of it for my small apartment.
3,"nice scenery, bad picture quality","There are some great winter scenes here (with some exceptions), but it's clearly a bad VHS transfer. The pictures are extremely grainy on a high def TV."
2,Too dated?,"My daughter read this for a school book club and thought it was OK. Probably a good story for kids to learn about living on a farm during this era, but she was almost (but not quite completely) bored with it as a stand alone story. The lady running the book club discussed another book by the author that sounded more interesting."
3,Gentle realistic fiction,"I feel pretty sure I read Thimble Summer when I was a little girl. I have a memory of disappointment; I was always hoping the thimble that the main character, Garnet, finds would turn out to be magic. It wasn't. This book was one of my early attempts with and disappointments with realistic fiction (though I have learned to love it in recent years.)The story is of a girl who discovers a thimble, a thimble that leads to a whole summer of good things. An orphan boy comes to live with Garnet's family, to help out during a time of drought on their farm. Garnet raises a pig that goes on to win the blue ribbon at the fair. It's good times for all."
3,A not so great book by a good author,"I didn't like this book very much, because there was hardly any excitment"
5,A Magic Thimble,"I really loved this book because it was about a girl who was easy for me to relate to. One very hot summer Garnet finds a thimble and that summer was the best. It rained that very night, and a new boy comes to live with them. And Garnet thinks it's all because of the thimble. It is really a great book to read. Every day I couldn't wait to read one more chapter. I got wrapped up once I started reading, and couldn't stop.If you want to read it, go read it!"
3,Worst Autechre,"I don't have Cavity Job so it might not be the very worst, but this Autechre cd sucks compared to anything else they put out. I am an AE trainspotter and I recommend you put this off till very last. The remixes here are nowhere near the quality of other Autechre remixes which remix the original past recognition. The ones here all sound pretty much the same."
4,Another great release,"The Weekend EP is a great companion to Everynight Fire Works. The 4 songs hardly seem like leftovers, and the secret track, Hey Mercedes cover of ""The Promise"" by When in Rome (I think), originally intened for Vagrant's Before You Were Punk series, is one of the better 80's covers I've heard. All in all another great release from this band, proving themselves to be much better than Braid ever was (that's right, I said it) and holding us all over until hopefully a new full-length album soon. Buy it."
2,I didn't learn much,"The author has just bought a new, large farm and I get the feeling he needed to write this book to pay down some of the mortgage. Every paragraph is chock full of ""probably"" ""might"" "" perhaps"" ""someday the scientists will figure it out"" etc. ad nauseum. The anecdotes of his own pets are cute and their stories well-told, but when he tries to link it all up to current research he can barely make a certain statement. He does give a lot of facts, but they are straws blowing in the wind. He admits he can't be sure of what his cats are watching. Go to any jungle at night and you'll see hundreds of eyes staring out of the wilds, not just the housecat or one of its larger cat relatives. For me, a frustrating read that didn't help me understand my own cats' thoughts."
5,Great,"BEst. Movie. Ever. Just saying.... came on time, no problems with cover or case. Movie in great condition plus I love this movie;)"
4,Kick ... Country,"Jill Olson has paired some of the most scathing lyrics in recent memory (""Tell her all your good ideas; most of them are mine, that I traded for your time."") with kicky tunes and breezy humor, and you have one of the greatest overlooked CDs of the 90s. It's hard to believe this CD is almost 7 years old -- it remains fresh as ever. Olson may be a bit too outlandish to ever be mainstream, but if you're looking for music that's smart without being precious and insightful without being pedantic, ""The Gal Who Would Be King"" (with a tip of the crown to Kipling) is just the tonic you need."
4,Ok. but could have been better!,"This was a great album, but it was a little miss leading, if you have first heard them on the punk-o-rama III Album, you'll hear Ordinary Fight, which is pure punk. But when you get the CD and hear the rest it's like a little slower. But still it deserved it 4 stars, if you are an Epitaph fan you'll love it, just like me."
2,What the hack is this?,"Just one of those things. Only Frankie's songs are great, Sammy Davis, Jr.'s songs are from the country album recorded in seventies (it sucks!) and Dino's songs are not ones that should be included here!"
5,"Simple, great rhythm toy!","I bought this for my 15 month old, who adores all rhythm toys. This fits perfectly for her little hands and also for my adult hands to hold. It's the perfect ""rattle"" for a toddler to get an easy, reasonably pleasant noise out of!"
2,Not worth the MESS,"This product is VERY messy and left a scar on my bikini line. Cleaning the applicator after each use is a hassle and the wax doesn't flow very good. You can actually injure your skin just applying this product!(the wax sticks& pulls as you roll on).It seems as if to lessen the pain of application you must squeeze hard and apply slightly more wax, however then strips won't adhere! The wax works pretty well but since the applicator doesn't you won't get consistent results- meaning patches. This product is very messy- although surprisingly it will wash off the skin very easily! It seems the applicator is really the problem. I suppose it could be effective if you can try applying it with out the applicator in a very- very thin layer."
1,Do not trust this book.,"I've read many Linux administration books, and consider myself a mid to senior level Linux administrator. This book has some serious problems. I'd be suprised if there weren't several other authors aside from the ones listed, because the book seems to be contradictory at times, and cobbled together.Most of the networking instructions are correct, and the file listings are generally all right, but the configuration instructions do not always lead to the results they're trying to achive, or do not match the output they show.I'd suggest a non RedHat specific book for Linux administration know how anyway - you'll get a more broad understanding of the issues without locking yourself into the way one particular distribution does things."
1,Many many typos,These books were clearly not proofread before publication. Typos in a book for a command line operating system are a definite no-no.
2,More of an Intro to Red Hat...,"While this rather large book does cover many Red Hat topics, it does so with little depth. You'll be much better informed by actually installing and configuring Red Hat/CentOS and reading the man pages. Caveat Emptor."
1,No Good,"This book is watered down and contains typographical errors. Some errors are 1 sentence apart and contradictory. This book is not for an administrator, but rather for someone who wants an error prone introduction to RedHat.-Ryan"
2,"very ""beginnerish""","As some of the other reviewers have said, this book is very watered down. The names of various utilities and how to install them from the command line & the graphical interface are mentioned, and in some cases a small amount of detail is provided. This book provided a good starting point for most linux networking utilities but that is about it."
2,"Not a great guide, not really great.","If I could I would give this book two and a half stars, but 2 will do. I am a complete noob when it comes to Linux and got this book for class. The book is getting really outdated. I had several different problems installing fedora and it was no hope. Not a great guide for a true beginner but makes a decent reference. I like a lot of examples when starting something new and the examples in this book are lacking. For being 1,000 pages its surprising what is left out."
4,Leave it to the Hill to keep it real,"First off lemmi start off by saying this is a good album over all but not as good as the Hills Masterpiece ""Temples of Boom"" but don't let that stop you from buying it(it sure as hell is better then there next 3 albums). Just like there other albums this is chuckfull of stand out tracks such as ""Eyes of the Pig"" and ""Lighting Strikes"". Not the Hills Best but is still a superb CH album.4.8/5 stars"
3,eh....ok,this cd was the 2nd best output of the cypress hill clan. the cd i thought could have had a lil less b real the only time barron rucks gets in is on the hooks...black sunday was miles ahead of this 1
5,Dj Muggs and B-Real: What else can I ask for?,"I am an old Cypress Hill fan, and telling the truth, I was shocked the first time I heard IV. B-Real rapping like Bone-Thugs, c'mon, give me a break. But, after a while, I start to like it. Especially the song, ""Checkmate"" where it feels like B-Real is running short in breathing. I am telling you, Cypress Hill sounds evolved.Well, music in some parts sound like the old Cypress, but so what? That is why we like them soo~ much, don't we! ""Riot Starter"" sounds like a mixture between electronica and gangsta rap. I like the beat where it repeats, ""Riooo~~~t Starterrr~"".In short, I recommend this album to all the Cypress Hill and Wu-Tang fans. B-Real and Dj Muggs are still there, Sen Dog returned back and the new bad boy, Barron Ricks helps to kick @$$. Thanx Cypress for the joy of it!!!"
3,Diddley and no Jack,"I did not like the switch in rhyming here from the jack style of rapping they had in black sunday and the album before. They switched to a diddley style rap and no, no I do not go for it. The whole atmosphere is phased and cannot adjust to it. A good example of diddley rap is Kid Frosts Smile now Die later disc where domino raps with him and they describe the whole murder that is a good diddley. The beats are good and hard on some songs (you really don't need to guess which ones they are)and to me are not very close in atmosphere to their previous albums but their sound is still there."
3,NOT THEIR BEST BUT OKAY.,This album had some very memorable songs and some which were not.Great beats to most of the songs and the rapping is also good.I think most cypress hill fans may like this one but its not a classic like black sunday.Peace out.
5,4 is my fav cypress hill album!,"I seen these guys on lolapolooza back in 94 and i just got hooked on them since then! I love all of their albums but this one is my personal fav with great tracks like "" looking throught the eye of a pig "" , ""checkmate"" , and , ""deadman tell no tales"" overall ? this album rules!!!Buy it!"
4,IV,"Another really nice album by the Hill, maybe new under the sky but DJ Muggs is brilliant as usual, and there are pretty good lyrics on it despite you miss Sen-Dog who doesn't appear too much on this CD,anyway songs like ""Looking through the eye of a pig"" ""Steel Magnolia"" or ""Tequila Sunrise"" makes a highly recomendable album to get."
1,Cypress Hill Returns.,"With all the bad press that rap has been getting this sorry excuse for an album will only worsen matters.If you like hip-hop beats that have been heard on their previous albums numerous times before than pick this up.Cypress Hill have returned and acknowledged that the younger hip hop artists have taken control of the genre.The lyrics are a sorry attempt to rip-off Black Sabbath or Slayer.The first track is an anti-cop song which has been done 100 times before by Public Enemy,2 Live Crew,and Ice-T.If you really want to hear aggressive, angry rap at its best then pick up and of Hill's previous albums.If you want this buy it fast cuase it won't be on the charts for long.The beats are reminisent of Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer."
3,Not sorry I purchased it,"Not nearly as good as Monsarrat's ""Cruel Sea"" but if you like sea stories, it's worth the read.Barry Pollock, Beijing"
1,The most repulsive show ever....,"wither you watch it online, DVD, or regular TV. This show is about the most repulsive thing on. I can not say what is worse about it. The bad tasteless jokes, the ugly animation, or the terrible writing. Whatever. It looks like it was made for the sick people that watch too much TV or stay online too long."
2,A confusing patchwork!,"A very confusing movie, which seems to have been hastily patched together. At times, it seems that the editors assembled footage from different films, with little attempts at continuity.The fight scenes are largely drab and unexciting, there's no character development to talk about. There is a plot, but given the muddled nature of the film, it's near impossible to follow - nor does it seem worth following.On a positive note, the transfer is pretty good: video and audio are fine, accurately reproducing a low budget, low quality HK film from the 70's.Supposedly, the star of this film was the king of Kung Fu films before Bruce Lee came along. This film, then, shows what a vital service Bruce did for the genre."
3,"Eerie, thoughtful, but self indulgent.","""Angels with Dirty Faces"" is an entertaining album in which Tricky shares his seemingly chronic (yet understandable) self pity with the listener. It's main fault is that it doesn't have the musical ingenuity of ""Maxinquaye"" or the anger of ""Pre Millenium Tension"", which makes it sound rather tired."
5,Tricky delivers another dark and adventerous gift,"If you are already a fan, you may at first be put off or surprised by the sound of Tricky's latest. Here, the sound is leaner, meaner, and less sequenced. This is not to say that created sounds and samples are non-existent, just that they are placed with more precision. On this outing, rhythm takes center stage even more so than before, with the live percussion giving this CD a jazz-like feel at times. (If Jazz makes you think of Kenny G, don't worry. We're talking Miles Davis here, not that sort of musical pablum.) Dark, brooding, and apocalyptic as always, this is another masterful step in Tricky's evolution. He's one of the most original and exciting artists out there, so if you haven't given a listen before RUN to the nearest store and buy whatever you can. Even if you're not a fan of what passes for hip-hop these days, Tricky will renew your faith in the form."
3,its A okay,There is nothing really wrong with thsi album but this feels to familiar and is way too similiar with every trip hop album out there
4,Much better than Pre-Millenium Tension.,"I HATE PRE-MILLENIUM TENSION! (I would give it zero stars if I could).""Maxinquaye"" will always be the best. This has a few good songs - the best being ""Broken Homes.""PMT has ""Vent"" - which isn't all that great...Maxinquaye's the best... then Nearly God... then Angels with Dirty Faces......AND DON'T BOTHER WITH Pre-Millenium Tension."
3,Face the dirt,"There is an appealing and intriguing grit emanating from these misunderstood paranoid soundscapes to mark AWDF as Tricky's last artistic achievement, but the intoxicating spell it once wove has mostly worn off while all the egotistical rantings remain."
3,expecting better,"Honestly, I was expecting better from Tricky with Angels with Dirty Faces. Pre-Millenium Tension and Maxinque were both really great albums but Angels with Dirty Faces seems to lose something. The album is still decent with some good songs like 6 minutes but overall the album falls flat and seems to have lost the inspiration and creativity that marked Tricky's previous material. If you want to get a good Tricky album, get Maxinque or Pre-Millenium tension."
4,Only for REAL tricky fans!!,"Yeah this is a fairly good album. A step in a fresh direction like his new album 'Juxtapose'. This is a dirty, mean and dark adventure. I like tricky's voice in this album it's really hard to hear and lazy. Cool!"
3,Hello? Tricky? Where are you?,"Will the real Tricky stand up please? Where is the genius behind the early massive attack and the most excellent Maxinquaye? Who is this angry little demon that made Pre Millennium Tension and this ""Angels.."" album? this work is very cloudy and unfocused. It is almost as though he ""wants"" us to hate this album. Tricky now operates out of USA instead of UK so maybe that has something to do with it. Don't buy this one first! Buy Maxinquaye or Nearly God if you want to hear some good Tricky."
5,love it as it is,"I listened to this album without expectations and without the urge to compare it with previous albums...and I loved it. I simply loved it for what it is... a piece of art. Tricky masters what I call ""collision of sound."""
3,I want the old Tricky.,"When I first bought Maxinquaye back in '96 I thought I had heard my new favorite musician till the end of time...then came Pre-Mil. And though I have to respect the boy for putting out something as strange as that, I have to admit I was disappointed, (with the exception of Christiansands) Now I get Angels with Dirty faces and just shake my head. He's no longer talking about about sex and being naughty, but trying to make a valid point about the music industry, rap and the business in general. I just want an album to make out to. I can philosiphize on the state of music today all by myself, I don't need him telling me what's going on. Plus I don't need to hear those whale screams on every song."
2,The latest step in Tricky's steady decline,"Since mesmerizing the world with Maxinquaye four years ago, Tricky's studio output has grown progressively worse. This album is damn near unlistenable. Simply put, it makes me feel bad, sort of in the way that The Cure's Pornography does. Now there may be a day when I feel like wallowing in my misery and want to put this CD on, but I'm not a teenager anymore so I can't foresee it.In fairness to Tricky, I saw his live show touring this record and the songs from Angels... sounded absolutely fantastic. But it does not translate at all on this record. Avoid it. Buy any of his other albums first."
2,Where's Martina?,"It is well known that Martina has always been the backbone of Tricky's songs. Her mysterious, alluring vocals show that she is a very talented singer and is able to convey emotion through the use of her purring soprano. But on this album she seems forced to serve as the cleanup crew to this scattershot emsemble of break beats and Tricky's ever so raspy lyrics."
3,Going Down-hill,"Since ""Maxinquaye"" was so wonderful I understand the urge people have to give everything Tricky does 5-stars, but surely others must have notice that all his cds since have been much lesser offerings. ""Pre-Millennium"" gets 4-star...a much denser album than the first, but still terrifically atmospheric. ""Nearly God"" seemed experimental and ""lighter"" that his previous work, but still no major complaints. That gets 4-stars as well. Now we Have ""Angles With Dirty Faces"" a cd that seems almost shallow when compared to the others. ""Broken Homes"" is a definate winner, but there aren't enough songs of that caliber. From what I gather Tricky is trying to take on the music business with this cd, but doesn't he realize his darker topics are so much more interesting? If you are already a fan, the cd is still worth the money, but otherwise you'd be better off saving your money and seeing this talent performer live when he comes to your town."
3,Not Quite Godly,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Tricky, but this CD doesn't quite live up to my expectations of his music. Maybe I should have listened to this one before Maxinquaye but I was greatly dissapointed. The rythms grow stagnant and extremely repetitive after a few listens and the vocals leave something to be desired. Still, a few tracks shine almost in spite of the rest of the album, and the rage of Tricky against ""the system"" gives a few of the songs an edge. Buy Maxinquaye or Nearly God for a TRUE Tricky experience."
3,Only For Tricky's Existing Fans,"By Tricky's already high standards, this is a difficult album with the identity crisis of trying to be Maxinquaye and Pre-Millinium Tension at the same time. Although, it doesn't really accomplish either goal, points are awarded for degree of difficulty. With time, this is an interesting listen for those that already have the aformentioned albums, but not the place to start for anyone interested in exploring the artist."
5,What genre is this anyway?,"I've often read how disapointed people were with this record and I have never understood why. Most artists can only aspire to re-arrange their influences in a new and sincere way. At best. Most of the time, however, we fail and only manage to produce lesser versions of what someone else has already done much more succesfully. ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", in my opinion, goes beyond adding a touch of sincerity and originality to other musicians' acomplishments. It is itself a fantastic example of what happens when artists let go of what they have heard or seen and reach into themselves to create something unlike anything before it. Of course nothing is created in a vacuum, and to some extent all artists build upon previous artists' works, but there are a precious few who throughout history manage to suprass their influences. Tricky is one of those aritsts, and this is his masterpiece."
5,"Wow woo oh, wow woo oh, wow woo oh FU FU ~","Renai Revolution is a genuine pop song, Japanese styleThe song is on my top 5 favorite Morning Musume song listIt's fast, its catchy, and the music video for it is cuteIf you like Morning Musume you should check this one out (You should have this if you are a fan)But if your not a fan, then it probably won't do much for you"
2,No substitute for a steamer,"This is a strange little device that makes suds out out of the top layer of your glass of milk. I guess it might be useful in creating something to dollop over your cappucino, but it is no substitute for steaming, which sweetens your milk while also frothing it. The Turbo Frother is probably not worth your money, unless you get it for free with the purchase of something else, as I did."
5,"Excellent resource f/the practitioner, regardless of setting","I was pleasantly surprised by the comprehensiveness of coverage that this book provides. Although I'm not easily impressed, particularly by ""all-in-one"" professional reference books, I will refer to this volume time and time again in order to refresh my memory about a concept, or learn some about an area of the law to which I have not previously had much exposure. Very usuful book."
3,dupont/comforel pillows,1 pillow nice and fluffy the other flat and hard almost as if they were 2 different pillows not worth the 98 bucks i have gottin the same results from the 10 wal-mart pillow
3,strange sense of humor,"This is not a normal war movie or a normal any kind of movie. It has a strange sense of humor and is worth buying used and watching once. I mailed it to my nephew in the 75th Rangers doing his 5th Afghan tour. I'll wait to see his take. In the mean time, the best tagline for it is the quote ""SMOKE FOR THE LADY?"""
2,"Design is terrible, quality is pretty good.","Quality is good. The construction and materials are pretty good. So why the 2-star review?Weak design. In the picture, the bag looks slim and smooth. In reality:- It's all bulky, bubbly and the center pocket looks like a huge pot-belly.- the material showed every single scratch and fingerprint.- The one middle pot-belly pocket was not designed with real life use in mind. What do you put in there? Everything you put in there all goes in one big bottomless pit.- The logo and strap are visually very annoying. They really wanted to be sure you saw their logo!So, in summary, don't spend too much money on this if you're going to buy it. There are so many options out there."
3,This is the earlier model with cheaper material,"This is a nicely designed bag with a huge flaw. The original Metrolite (not the II or III) is made of a nylon that is easily damaged and flakes off bits of black plastic. I made the mistake of putting an ipod cord inside the flat side pocket and that pushed out enough to scar the outside vinyl after only one day of use. I've noticed from photos of the Metrolite II and III that they switched to a more durable material. Other than this one flaw, I like the bag. It's well designed offers great protection to my MacBook."
5,Suzanne Vega,"It is an amazing show, great concert, Suzanne Vega is fantastic, handles the audience beautifully, I watch it quite often. Great buy."
5,Excellent,"This might be the best-sounding live album I've ever heard. I always say that you can't truly ""get"" a band until you take in their live show. All kinds of tricks and cleanups can be done in the studio, but the bands who take everything to the stage and pull it off flawlessly, making it sound effortless, are the ones who stand above the rest. These two discs have me constantly in awe of the sheer technical skill and musical taste that they put on display. It might be better than the average studio release. More people should own this. You should own this."
2,Where is Disc 1,Just a minor problem. I ordered this CD before Christmas. I wanted APSOG and this seemed like a no brainer - a double live disc for the price of one. Turns out my CD had two discs 2 but no disc 1. I liked the second disc but can't rate the first. I'm wondering if anyone else had the same problem.
4,Good Practice,"This book was demanded for a TOEFL practice class. It has a lot of tips and deals with each of the four TOEFL topics in detail.Each TOEFL section is introduced in the book and starts out with more easy exercises and practical tips. Tasks are getting more difficult the more one digs into one section. Besides the right solutions for the reading and listening sections, this book also provides sample writing and speaking responses from students that have taken the TOEFL.To conclude, this book is structured well and provides excellent hints and tips for the TOEFL. It deals also with the grading factors of the actual TOEFL test. However, this book was published in 2005, which makes it hard to tell in how far this book is still up to date in terms of the TOEFL test. If it was not for the purpose of a course I would probably have choosen a newer guide."
4,Wonderful!,This CD is great! If you like classical music then Chopin is a must and so is this CD!!! Most of the Relaxation CDs are wonderful and this one is up at the top. Has a lot of his classics plus a few that aren't so well known. I listen to it all the time when I am studying (which I should be doing now!) or just reading. It's fabulous for when it's too quiet and you just need some noise. Wonderful CD!!!
3,Not All Relaxing,I am new to classical music. I figured I'd start out simple and get something relaxing with this cd since i had heard Chopin in a movie and liked it. For the most part this is a very enjoyable cd. But tract number 10 is NOT relaxing and everytime i get to it i have to either grit my teeth and listen or get up and fast forward. Its annoying and unnecessary.
3,"More of a supernatural drama/thriller than a horror flick, but worth checking out.","Personally, I enjoyed Premonition, although I wasn't blown away. It's got solid acting, a fascinating (and often heart-wrenching) story, and some decent scares. However, don't expect an all out fright fest or you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a story-driven film, with a plot that progresses fairly slowly. Patience is necessary when viewing Premonition, as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and dream-like logic in a film. But for those of you who possess those qualities, and are looking for something a little different (particularly if you're a fan of the genre), Premonition might be for you."
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"I've watched alot of great asian horror movies, but this was not one of them. The story though interesting failed to keep me entertained and the ending could have ended 2 or 3 times before it finally did. But I have to say it had some good plot twists and a great idea for a movie. Watch this movie I just say rent before you buy, I may have enjoyed it the first time but I couldn't sit through it again."
2,BIG BANG!,"This movie starts out with a bang and ends with a bang. It's the middle that tends to drag on. It has a few good scarry moments, but not many. I'm a huge fan of Asian horror and I'm not sure this movie belongs in that genre. The one thing that seems to be consistent in Asian cinema is that no matter what genre, horror, gangster, revenge, there always seems to be that underlying human element and the theme of redemption. And that's what I love about it. What intrigues me the most about this story is the father's intense love for his daughter and wife. This love is at the core of the movie and motivates the father to make the choice which sets him free.It's a good movie. You won't regret watching it even if it is a little slow at times."
3,Bit Different But Not Fantastic,"Premonition is a good Jap-horror movie. It doesn't include the usual ""Sadako-Long-Hair-Creepy-Girl"" found abundantly in most horror asian movies.The plot takes on a different story, along the lines of Final Destination without all the gaudy gore that hollywood movies have, combined with that television series where the guy gets the newspaper a day early. It still has that simplistic quality that I love with these kind of films. Subtle scaring, maximum effect.There are times though that the story kinda lags.. it can use some improvements with some effects too.. then again, the uniqueness of the plot makes up for some its failings.I have to say, this isn't the normal scary horror movie.It's more drama.. more like a psychological thriller.RECOMMENDATION:If you're a fan of asian scary flicks, THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE.If you're looking for some clean kinda scary entertainment.. this movie is good to watch."
2,this was filmed at the same time as juon...,it reminded me of the ring only instead of a phone call you get a newspaper. original? not really. scary? nope. tense moments yes. should be enjoyed if you are into this horror asian movement going on right now.
1,Complete waste of money,"If you own MCE 2005, don't bother with this book. After ""reading"" this book (which took about 30 minutes), I learned absolutely nothing more than I learned by playing with the menus and options in MCE.I was expecting a book that would give more technical tips and such, but there was none to be found. I suppose if you didn't own MCE and didn't have means to go the Microsoft website to learn the basics, this book might be interesting. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Not Even Worthy of One Star,"PC Magazine Guide Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005At best, this book was a gross dissappointment. I was written as if it were a sales brochure and is the worst waste of money by me in recent memory. Actually when I researched Amazon Books, I was hoping that Dr.Indera E. Murphy, the auther of two excellent books: No Stress Tech Guide to Works 8, and No Stress Tech Guide to Windows XP. No such luck. When I was looking for a book on XP Media Center Edition, there were a number of choices, but none by Dr. Murphy. Of those available, I probably made the worst possible choice."
2,Not very good reference for newbies to MC,"Never having used a TiVo or Media Center before I was interested in a book that would help get acquainted with MC as well as help me use all of the features. MC is not that intuitive to use so a good manual is needed to get full functionality. This book aint it.This book does tell you how to use MC features but leaves the detail up to you. For example, it may show the menu you use for changing a setting but not how to drill down to it is left up to you.It's sorta helpful but I'm sure there are better books out there.Surprised that PC Magazine put their logo on this rather poor book."
4,Learning XP Media Center,"I am recently retired and traded in my ""office"" computer for a media center in order to deal with pictures, videos and music. Although I had been working with documents since 1981, the entertainment category was new to me. The PC Magazine Guide to Windows XP Media Center was a great help."
3,it was pretty tight,"if you are truly lookin' for somethin' good to ride to you need to checkout the song ""Bring 'em out"" it's too tight!!!"
3,Rite in Rain - Fly Fishing,"I love the layout and set-up of this book. However, the paper material makes it difficult to write on without smearing. The only recourse is to use pencil. I have tried pens and specialty permanent markers and the ink takes at-least 10-20 minutes to dry. Great Product and Size! I just pre-write most of my trips and finish them on the way home and leave the book open to not smear the ink."
3,"Could be better, but not bad.","I read about this band and this album in a copy of ""Paste"" magazine. Being into southern rock, I chose to give this album a chance. I wasn't exactly blown away by it, but I don't regret buying it. Quite a few of the songs are pretty good, ecspecially ""True Born Leader"", ""Could It Be"", ""Free Man Now"", and ""This Time"". The main problem with the album isn't the quality of the songs, it's just that so many of them sound very similar. It's good for an album to have some kind of theme or for the songs to have something in common, but they just shouldn't sound so similar.So basically, this album probably won't blow you away, but this band has definitely got talent. I just hope their next album has a little more variety."
5,"Great reeds for a nice, stable sound tones","We like it. Some recommend Vandoren for an intermediate/advance player, but we like Rico Royal the best. We are over 2 year users."
5,Alto Sax reeds.,"Arrived as expected on time. All reeds look good and have ordered more. They seam to not last very long before they chip but I think that is more me than the reeds,"
1,Not what I expected,I never used this brand before i ordered these. They split almost immediately. I went through them way to soon. I was not pleased with this product.
4,Royal Reeds,The reeds are fine (as far as I can tell - I'm just learning) and the transaction went without a hitch.
1,Weak tone !,"I've been using Primo's for a while and love them but they're very hard to find.Thought I try these b/c of the good reviews.Very disappointed... these reeds (and I tried 7 of the 10 to be sure)sound like I'm playing thru a towel....Muffled & weak.On the upside, I purchased the Rico ""plastiCOVER"" reeds in the same orderand absolutely love them !!! They last long & provide excellent tone throughoutthe life the reed."
3,price OK for quality,"This seems to be the right price for the reeds. However, sometimes shipping is excessive given the spend level and the product. I buy these for my son, I really don't know much about the quality of the product I rely on the recommendation of the band teacher."
5,sax reeds,"Good deal on reeds, lowest price I found. Item just as described. Great transaction, would buy from this seller again."
5,Just what I wanted...,"I trust only Rico reeds for my clarinet and alto sax, and I was happy that I got it, well worth the money!"
5,Psychology of Money: How to Discover Your Midas Touch,"I was touch by the way this book was written, I felt that it was talking to me. I could read the case studies illustrating the practical experience of people in search of finding ways to move in this society with more ease and confidence. It didn't give a general formula, but yes many possibilities.The worksheets I finded very useful to practically see my situation and make me think of options, that didn't occur to me before reading this book."
4,Don't let the goofy cover art throw you off...,"This was actually a damn good movie, and I was very pleasently suprised by it. I rented it not expecting much (as you often do, with these types of movies) but, this movie was much better than I expected it to be, and had some very cool story twists as well as special fx. I think that this movie is one of the better examples of the genre, and it probably hasn't gotten the exposure it deserves. A VERY good film, IMHO."
3,Pleasant suprise!,"I didn't expect much of this movie, particularly after seeing the hologram packaging, but it turned out to be _really_ good. It has some nice touches, some bizarre twists, and some really likable characters. It did have me scratching my head from time to time (why does the power of good imbue you with a troll head? ), but it was altogether a good romp of a film. The magician duo and their last stand against pressing hoards of zombies is just a classic moment. If you're a horror fan, you'll get a kick out of this film."
3,50/50,"I'm kind of in the middle on this one. It is a very eerie movie. It also has a good story line which is well explained. My issues with it are, it is an Evil Dead rip off, which was very common around this time. I actually saw this movie originally when it first came out and remembered liking it enough to order the DVD. After viewing it again (mind you I was in my 20's when I first saw it, I'm 44 now) it seemed kind of stupid in parts. Could have done without the martial art magicians. All that said, I would recommend it to fans of the horror genre. Especially some of the younger generation of horror fans who have probably seen the Evil Dead and Demons movies, but may not have heard of this one due to it's obscurity. Also, be aware that all of the DVD copies that I could find require a DVD player that is PAL compatible (able to play foreign DVD's). I tried it on both of my DVD players and neither worked. I was able to view it on my computer, however."
4,A good scary movie,when I first saw this movie I thought it was really scary it still is scary think about it being trapped there with zobmies and you could become possessed by a demon too.
5,FUN NITE,"LOVED ALL PIRATES MOVIES--- JOHNNY DEPP IS A DREAM!!! GAME WAS LOTS OF FUN--TILL I LOST IT, IN MOVING. BOO-HOO!"
3,Not the best,"I got this game and really it was i thought very boring to play, not much more i can say."
2,I just don't get it...,"I bought this book as a resource for the drama program I teach at a private elementary school. I'm not sure if something was lost in translation - but it seemed very dated. The language, the ideas, the approach...all of it was not very relevant."
5,Excellently organized book.,"This book presents various mathematical principles in an organization I have not seen before. It starts with the idea of a transformation, then goes on to relate eigenvalues and eigenvectors to general spectral theory, explain how the need for closed function spaces naturally leads to Lebesgue integration (I know about Lebesgue integration before but I didn't know why it was needed), and show how the definition of certain inverse operators leads to distribution theory. This is a very natural way of organizing these principles. While other books, such as Strang's Intro to Applied Mathematics and Rudin's Real & Complex Analysis, provide you with one mathematical ""toy"" after another (Fourier series, Lebesgue integration, etc.), Keener's book tells you why you need the toy before giving it to you."
2,Bad sticker placement destroys the usage of this tea strainer,"This tea strainer is a perfectly good tea strainer. A tea strainer is a tea strainer, and I find this style to be more convenient than a tea ball when I'm at work. However, Bodum has gone ahead and made their product extremely irritating to use, by placing their product sticker on the bottom of the strainer! The sticker is very sticky, and although I've peeled off the paper, the glue simply won't come off. Nail polish remover only made it worse. Nothing I can do with soap, scrubbing it with a sponge, my nails, anything, can get this glue off. I don't want glue in my tea. So this perfectly good tea strainer is rendered useless by Bodum's lack of intelligent thought. They could've put the sticker on the bottom of the part that sits on the table, not the part that goes in your tea. Bodum strikes out with this completely needless irritating decision."
2,Well it was cheap,"Disappointed is an understatement. In actuality the film is pretty good or better. The disappointment is not one full song shown and some, Spider John are only 10 seconds. I know that not every second was filmed but here's an idea that would have satisfied Lerner's artistic desires and many peoples natual desire to see moreof the music. Double the price, on disc one show the film and on disc 2 have full versions of 2 hours of Artists. And I mean everyone from the 3 song electric Dylan to some Joan and all the biggies to the more obscure examples of our culture like the cloggers shouters etc. 2 things would then happen, I could watch the film without the constant feeling of coitus interuptus and see some killer acts from my very young life and our culture as a people. As it is the price is right if you want it but I doubt I'll watch it a 2nd time"
3,Slayer the Abishai,"Come on. When I read pages 50 and 51, I was soooo outraged when Slayer dies. I can't believe he dies. He's a character that would have changed the whole world if he hadn't been killed by Sirana, that devil. Slayer is the greatest character in this book. Oh my goodness. If he wasn't killed, he could have easily destroyed the kingdom of Phlan. And, Not only that, he could've been the ruler of the world. That would have changed the whole entire book. Other than all of that, the book was hilarious! Oh my goodness, I totally love the part when Kern goes ""Begone, spirit of evil."" and Listle goes ""'Begone, spirit of evil! Oh, that was great, Kern! I'm sure a real ghost would jump and run at that!"". And oh my goodness, I love the part when Sirana goes ""Here, let me help you, little sister."" and Listle thinks to herself: I'm not your little sister! Oh my goodness, I've got the giggles just writing that. After all, that is my last name."
1,Not Worth It,"This DVD was a disappointment, as was Volume 2. I would not recommend it to those of us who love Rock 'n' Roll. The entertainers were fine, but I guess they were trying to imitate American Bandstand in some way. It really is a shame. I was looking forward to a great DVD, instead, I realize I would never want to watch it again."
5,"Talk about ""Pickn' up tha pace""","This makes me wanna, wanna.....drink a beer,smoke somethin' and PARTY!"
2,Common Sense Stuff,"I found this book only provides common sense stuff, not very insightful. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout this book."
5,works for us,We print 100-200 pages a day in our Medical Transcription business. The brother laser printers do a good job at a reasonable price.
4,good in general,"the toner last forever, i have a small business and i print lots of documents. it has a great quality for good price.sometimes it leaks"
2,Don't buy early,"We have bought a number of replacement cartridges for our Brother 8850DN through Amazon. This one though prints very light right out of the box. Unfortunately, Since I ordered it to have on hand when our other cartridge failed, it was more than 30 days since I ordered it. Only 50% refund and I would have to be without a cartridge. I'll buy locally from now on because it is a business critical item."
3,It's Toner,Hard to get excited about toner. But it has performed the way I expected. ie: no problems.The package arrived in good condition and it was a good price.It goes a little faster than I'd like but that is really more of a printer issue.
1,bad print quality,the product quality is horrible. It leaves streak on the print job. It makes noise while printing. will like to return. I do not want it to damage my printer
1,Cartridge Leaks,After using this cartridge for a few weeks. It started to leak toner.It made a big mess out of the printer. This resulted in having to vacuum out the printer and get a new cartridge.Bought a refurbished one from Amazon and it solved the problem.I called Brother Customer Service and they said I had to put the bad one back in and check the lights. I refused! Spoke to the supervisor and he informed me it did not matter since I had purchased it more than 90 days ago. The would not honor any warranty on a defective product.
5,SPEEDKING does it all,"This band knows how to make music. This double CD is amazing not just for SPEEDKING fans, but for anyone who is into the punk/thrash sound. I suggest you go out and get it now!!!"
5,A great release at last!,"This release is a gift from the gods. It is a two disc release. The first disc is their never released album ""the fist and the laurels."" It was recorded in 1997 but the time gap is irrelevant. The music speaks for itself. Speedking's sound is punk/dance/thrash and it comes alive in your ears on this 2 cd set. The second disc is a combination of all Speedkings seven inch releases with a bonus track too! This is a great release for Speedking fans and those with an ear for punk/thrash."
3,"Slight tan, good SPF","I expected this product to work like other Neutrogena sunless, Buil-a-Tan products. However, the ""tan"" afforded by this product is slight. Perhaps it works best for people with a very light skin tone (my skin is light to medium). Also, I can't use the lotion for more than a few days at a time as my skin gets irritated for some reason. I was happy to find a facial SPF 15 that also contained a tanner. The fragance of this product is less strong than similar products by different manufacturers.I purchased this product via Amazon because I couldn't find it on local drug store shelves or on the Neutrogena web site."
5,Fits like a glove!!,"These brackets are awesome!!! Perfect fit...uses original bolts. The only thig about putting your lights on the windshield is, when you pop your hood....and go to flip it up against the windshield, the hood will now rest on your lights....no biggie...just rest it on them easy. And you can forget about flipping your windshield down too. I always wanted to do it once....never got around to it."
2,horrible,i love crass and all their music they've released and their bandmembers other bands but this album is one of the worst live recordings i've ever heard.it is porly recorded and really hard to listen to.don't get it.get their other albums.christ-the album has better sounding live songs thatn this.
4,"For those with ""ROMANTIC"" tattooed across their foreheads","""Comenzare"" is a very good debut cd. Luis Fonsi's music blends a lot of different influences, creating a new ""Latin soul"" genre. So far two of the singles have reached Top 20 positions in Billboard Latin Singles Charts, and the first cut, ""Si tu quisieras"" is the theme song for a new Mexican soap (""Soñadoras"")."
5,Comenzaré,"Comenzaré es el mejor CD de este genero que habia escuchado antes y Luis Fonsi con su simpatía vuelve locas a todas las mujeres y me gustaría felicitarlo,sigue hacía delante y triunfa que eso es lo que te espera por tu bella voz y tu simpatía son los mejores deceos de tu fanatica #1."
5,que bonito! (Luis y todo!),"The song that made me want this album the most was SI TU QUISIERAS. It is a gorgeous song...""If you wanted"" (literally)Luis has a beautiful, classically trained voice, that makes me think of opera and also, of course, has a pop sound to it. You can tell he has a lot of soul and love for what he does--his music. Every song makes this more and more evident. COMENZARE, PERDONAME, TU CALOR....all of the tracks stick to the formula of love songs (herida--heartbreak, el amor de juventud--the love of youth, primer amor--first love, la tracionera--betrayal), but are never boring because Luis just sings his heart out.........For me, it was like he was in the same room with me, it was that moving. Please go out and buy this CD! You will not be disappointed."
4,The bark goes on,"The bark spray worked fairly well depending how tenacious your dog is. My dog is a grat pyreeanees and sometimes she would choose to bark ""through the spray"".She is a particular difficult breed with the barking.It did stop all the nonsense barking so now she only barks at something she really wants to bark at and I don't think there is any way to stop that, it's in her genetics. She is a guard dog and she guards her castle."
2,Probably not the correct choice,"All this spray and collar taught my dog was to avoid the spray. In fact, she looks like a prize fighter bobbing & weaving to avoid being hit! In addition, now she's totally afraid of anything that we use in a spray form. This includes Chill Out and other beneficial (not punishing) products. I would try another form of training instead of this method."
2,Not a good buy,This product in conjunction with the gentle no bark collar aren't a good choice at all. The collar is difficult to load and doesn't really work well. Plus the spray wasn't really a deterant for my dog. The end result was my house smelled like freakish lemons and my dog kept right on barking.
4,To Bark or not to Bark... that is the question,"I have a 16 mo. old Border Collie that likes to bark for any or no reason at all. At first try of the Citronella spray (used with the Gentle Spray Bark collar) she became somewhat anxious & frantic not knowing where this spray was coming from. But after about 3 or 4 uses, she adapted & realized what this collar was for. Overall, the spray works 75% of the time with my dog. If she is determined to bark, she will; but most of the time the spray is a deterent. Amazon is the only place I would buy the refills due to it being the best bargin around. Don't buy it at your pet store because you will be paying way too much!"
5,Works!!! But if you have a smart dog beware!,I use this collar on 2 beagles. You must keep filled. One of my beagles learned quiclky that she could bark until the spray ran out-she was conditioned that she could bark and get sprayed for about 25 sprays and then be free of the annoyance. It worked great until she learned this-my fault as I should have brought her in to check the fill status. Only downside is that there is no way of knowing how full the unit is. I just follow directions and use can for 20 seconds. I have used shock collars also but consider this to be the best. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and unit has a shutoff to conserve battery life. Refils can be expensive if purchased at specialty store (Petsmart/petco).
1,Particular Item Didn't Work,I love the collar and I love the spray that comes in the blue bottle - the ones that come in the yellow bottle/sprayer didn't work out. The spray wouldn't actually go into the collar for some reason - it just spritzed all over my hand when I would try to spray it into the collar. Not clear on what the issue was but it happened with the last three that I had.
3,ok,dogs get used to it. i think it needs stronger stuff! what about a little vinegar? are radio systems better?
1,horrible,the material is very cheap and puts swirls in your paint ... do not buy unless you care less about your cars appearance
3,Will not clean car well enough,"This mitt does hold soap and water well, but the problem is that it cannot remove dirt, grime, etc. easily. A cotton cloth is better than this. It does remove minor surface dirt, but for deeper stuff you need to use another type of cloth. One good thing is that it reduces the overall time spent on my car-washing from up to 2 hours down to 1 hour. Also, it is very easy to rinse out the mitt and get rid of surface dirt that attached onto the mitt from your car. Beats going to a car wash and paying $$$ for someone to use dirty cloths to wipe your car. Would NOT use it on a brand new car as the mitt surface is a bit rough. If you've got the money but a softer mitt."
2,Will scratch your car! (especially a black one),"As noted by a previous reviewer, this product will scratch the clearcoat on your car's paint. I have a black 2007 Honda Pilot and after I was done washing it, I could definately see the swirl marks from were I had washed it with the mitt. During the first use however, I was impressed with how much water and soap it held. I will stick to using a lambs wool mitt like I should have done in the first place. I guess you get what you pay for..."
2,Not soft enough!,This wash mitt WILL scratch your car. It is not nearly as soft as a pure lambswool or microfiber mitt. I should have known when it stated polyester/nylon blend in addition to the wool (there must be only trace amounts of wool btw). You would never wash your car with a polyester/nylon shirt so don't do it with this mitt.I would return it but it will cost me almost as much to return since it is only 4.88. Only good for washing the bottom of your car or your wheels. DO NOT USE IT ON CLEARCOAT! Save your money and get a pure lambswool or pure microfiber wash mitt or use a natural sponge. Those are superior.
2,Disappointed with the results...,"After using Rain-X on many previous vehichles and satisfied with it's results, however not happy with it's relatively short life on glass, I decided to try Defender. I followed all directions 'to a T', cleaning the glass with an amonia based glass cleaner (Windex) prior to application. Defender does bead water, however the water doesn't run off the glass as efficiently as hoped... simply beads the water. Expected more. For $15.00 will not apply again!"
2,unimpressive,"This is not anything new, nor special. ""Integrated"" brush did not leave an even coat, needed to wipe, same as glass-x. Treatment lasted less than one month, also same as glass-x."
