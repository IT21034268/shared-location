1,"Not Believable, Tedious","I read this book for my Book Club and was very disappointed. The author spends a great deal of time creating these one dimensional characters, who then suddenly behave so far outside the believable that you want to just stop reading the book altogether. I could not empathize with a single character in this tedious book. And the ending happens quite suddenly and unsatisfactorily. The Epilogue is the worst part of all- leaves you feeling totally perplexed (""How did THIS happen??""). With so many great books out there, I felt I had wasted my time on this one."
2,What was the hype about????,"I ran across this book at a book sale and bought it because I remembered seeing it on the best sellor list a year or so ago. My expectations were high because it had apparently sold so well. I see that other reviewers praise it highly. Frankly, the story just didn't work. There are some good scenes and some interesting character development, but this is one that I'm really not recommending to friends. Maybe its me, but Bel Canto just didn't ring my bell."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this book after hearing some rave reviews. I was disappointed in the lack of information about the motivation for the terrorists. I am not an Opera fan, so all the people who were in love with the Opera singer just because she was good at Opera and was young and pretty seemed shallow. The opera singer herself seemed rather shallow & I never really understood why she fell in love with Mr. Osikawa. He liked her voice - but so did 20 other men there. He was the richest, but nothing else seemed to set him apart. Also, the emphasis on beauty was a bit annoying. Carmen & Roxanne were pretty, therefore they were good and kind a sweet. Beatrice was not, so she was stupid, mean and selfish. I know this wasn't the intention, but that's how it struck me. I was disappointed."
1,Looks promising but is incredibly poor....,"I had wanted to read this book for awhile based on the backcover blurb and was excited when I finally bought it. This enthusiasm quickly died as I encountered unrealistic characters, a ridiculous plot premise, and a whole catalog of sentiment best left to trashier romance novels. An absolute let-down and a waste of time."
2,"Down with ""Bel Canto""","Difficult to hold my interest. I belong to a book club, and this was the book that the entire club read. All of us had the same opinion....that is, it was difficult to read, boring, and did not hold our interest."
3,great read with a ridiculous plot,"I really enjoyed the writing style of Patchett, but, the story line is ridiculous. The transformation of nearly all of the characters has a ""good feel"" to it, but, it is too unrealistic to be taken seriously. There were times in the book where I just wanted the end to come, whether it would be sad or satisfying. It was too much of a stretch for me. The style, mood, and texture of the book was excellent, too bad the story failed. k in nj"
3,Bel Canto,"I was intrigued by the theme. But I found the reading difficult,there seemed to be way too many words to keep the plot moving along. The characters were well developed, but it was hard to follow just what the author was trying to communicate. I liked the use of multi-cultural characters. I liked the metamorphing of individuals, and the relationship between music and love and the universality of those concepts. But it was a struggle for me to finish reading the book...it simply didn't move along well, not a page turner."
2,"Beautifully written, meaningless story","Was taken immediately by the beauty of the prose. Ann Patchett is a literary craftsman of the highest degree. Her descriptions are unmatched. However, did not come to truly care about any of the characters. They did not seem real or fully realized. Also, the story takes strange, unsupported twists. Why does the opera star have an affair with the Japanese businessman? Why does she marry his assistant? None of it makes any sense. And after the storming of the performance by the terrorists, there is no action for page after page. It was a painfully difficult read toward the end; and it was a great disappointment that such a beautiful writer did not have a better imagination."
2,Bel Canto in Slow Motion,Very slow mid portion of book. A stretch to imagine this really happening - a fictionalized account of a real event (the embassy take over in Peru or Chile). A few gems in the first chapter. SLowwwwwwww!
4,Intriguing look at hostage /terrorist psychology...,"A well written book examing the interpersonal relationships that form amongst a group of hostages and terrorists. The plot starts with a bang and then simmers throughout the novel until it reaches the inevitable conclusion. The beauty is in the interactions between the characters. For people who are fans of an action packed plot, this book will be slow. For those interested in the development of personal relationships, this book will be excellent."
3,The Heaven of Hostage Situations,"If you can push aside the blatant unrealistic nature of the story, you will enjoy it. The prose alone made me want to read on. There is no doubt Patchett is gifted in expressing the art of human nature.Don't read this book for the story b/c you will be disappointed. The hostages are bored and guess what that makes you? Just as bored. The novel picks up about 3/4 of the way through, gives the reader a hopeful feeling and then it ends. You'll want to toss the book off a cliff."
5,great book for beginners,"Excellent presentation of materials and tools needed to begin this hobby. Also, step by step directions for several techniques"
3,Refer to ......,"This is a good book for beginners in that it covers all the basics without getting too fancy. It covers techniques such as using decorative edge scissors, corner and craft punches, how to use die-cuts and creative lettering, rubber stamps and embossing. My only BIG complaint is that it is always refering to another technique on another page, so I constantly have to flip back and forth. For example, in Technique 9 (how to use die-cuts, the first 3 steps refer to other techniques. Aggravating! Otherwise, good book for BEGINNERS!"
2,For beginners or those in need of creative assistance only..,"I just started scrapbooking a month ago, although I have an extensive background in art. I picked up this book thinking I would get a lot of ideas and tips that would help me add pizazz to my pages.All of the ideas presented in this book were things I had already come up with on my own. I was very disapppointed in this book, because when I'd thumbed through it in the store, I really liked the page layout style they'd used in the examples, but the tips and theory behind them were too simple for me. I took it back and exchanged it for ""Mastering Scrapbook Page Design"" by Michelle Gerbrandt, which is a much better resource for anyone from a beginner to an experienced scrapper."
2,Love the burlesque!,"The story isn't so great, and definitely not original; a combination of Coyote Ugly and Save the Last Dance. The few burlesque performances are fun and too short. Not sure why they kept it so tame. Ending is too obvious."
1,Awful!,"This book is a terrible waste of a tremendous amount of money. Halfway through you are asked to make a list of jobs you could do, then pick the ones you like. Hasn't everybody thought of this? If I had any idea as to what kind of careers were available to someone such as myself I wouldn't need a book like this at all. Not only do I wish I had my money back, I'd also like my time back too."
5,A Useful Guide,"The book basically covers the essentials of the Islamic Faith. At a time Islam as a religion is being discussed in all over the world, I think it is a great source to get the accurate information. Beyond his extensive knowledge on the subject, the author not only explains Islam but also clarifies its fundamentals through going into details of the underlying logic of the issues. I would personally recommend the book for anyone who may want to acquire useful information about Islamic Faith in the modern world."
3,English Teacher's Friend,"I ordered this to use in my high school English classes.The kids loved it and I found it tobe a great ""hook"" for their learning more about language. Thanks for making my classroom amore interesting and fun place for learning!"
3,Feeder Revew,"This product is great for feeding you baby fresh fruit or bread before they are ready to eat completely on there own. Important in this produce is the 16 replacement bags. I purchased a similar produce from a different company that had the bag attached to the feeder. Attached bags are more difficult to clean/wash. The Sassy feeder bags completely detach and can be rinsed and washed well. (Takes a long time to get banana cleaned!) So for its use, this is a 5-star product. I did not give it 5 stars however, because of the usage part. It is difficult to open and close and cumbersome to handle a baby on your hip and the feeder at the same time. Cleaning can be difficult as part of the feeder has a groove (I used a knife to scrape out the groove out, but it didn't feel very sanitary). Finally, it is a short-term use product and not something that would typically be passed onto another user, so it becomes another piece of plastic in the landfill only after a very short time."
3,could trap food in handle,"It has a water filled bladder in handle to ""keep food cool"". First, I doubt it would really keep it too cool for long. But the thing I noticed is that when I cleaned it, food got stuck in the crack between the handle and bladder. I had to scrape it out with a toothpick and am not sure I got it all or just crammed it in further. I really liked it over the other sasy one I bought because it was a little bigger. It was easier to cram a banana end into it. I got lots of extra bags so I will be using it still but am a little worried. The bags are hard to clean, but not too bad. Do not try to dishwash them because it just did not work. I have washed them by hand and then sterilized them in my steam bags; I do not know if I needed to sterilize them really but it did not hurt. I do not think I could sterilize the handle because of the bladder. I do not know though."
5,Gabrieli,Anyone who has played in a brass ensemble knows wgo Giovanni Gabrieli is. This is some of the most fun music to play by a brass player as weelas to listen to. I would buy it again.
2,SMC wireless card,"very moody product, somedays it works somedays it doesnt. I always thought it was my connection but after getting a wireless laptop, I knew the problem was this card. it's downright horribe because you will lose connection every 10-15 min. DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
5,still great after more than 30 years,"I first heard this album (yes, I still have the original vinyl too) not long after it came out. I was in college at Miami of Ohio playing drums in a band that touched on some of Back Door's approaches...as well as those of Coltrane, Zappa, Corea, and others. Jive Grind remains my favorite cut, followed closely by Human Bed.I know from direct experience that a trio is one of the hardest musical formats. There is no place to hide. There is little forgiveness if you are not 100% all of the time. While all three musicians are superb, Colin Hodgkinson did things on the electric bass guitar in 1972 that most players of today are still incapable of. Only Jack Bruce and Jack Casady come to mind as contemporaries and peers."
4,Best Hot Wheel playset I've seen.,"My son got this for his 6th birthday. He loves it, and I think that compared to the other Hot Wheel playsets that he has gotten in the past (which are now packed away or thrown away) this is the best one yet. It stays together and works like it's suppose to. It doesn't take up much room, and he gets a kick out of trying his other Hot Wheels cars to see which ones work with this set. He prefers to use it without the revolving raptor heads so it won't stop the cars. I would recommend this toy to anyone that has a boy that loves playing with Hot Wheel cars!"
2,Disappointing,I recently have gotten reinvolved with Hot Wheels with my 4 year old. I remember playing with Hot wheel tracks and how much fun they were to me in the 70's. The tracks were simple but one could do wonders with imagination. This set does not add to an imagination. The 6 in 1 set is much better and easy to create your own Hot Wheel world.
5,Comfortability I've Been Missing,"I don't understand why this wasn't included with my Ranger BC but it makes a big difference, especially wearing a steel tank on my back. I noticed on my buddy's Ranger LTD that his lumbar pad doesn't have the side ""wings"" like this add-on does. Great product, although I feel we shouldn't have to pay extra for a comfort item. I could understand all the extra accessories and D-rings on the LTD but the lumbar pad should come on all Zeagle BC's. Either way, it's worth the money."
1,"False advertising - 5-count, not 75-count","The offer here is very clear, especially with the note that ""You save $42.81."" Yet when I went to order, I called PETCO first and they told me they are aware of the problem, have received complaints but have done nothing about it. The price advertised is for 5 patties only. This is false and deceptive advertising."
4,"Zoey loves them, but they're kinda greasy","Merrick turkey patties, about 4"" across. For some reason, I imagined these to be a chewy texture, like jerky. Instead, they're hard, and when Zoey crunches on them, I'm reminded of someone eating toffee. So, I'd have to say these are kinda hard English toffee textured. And they're greasy, I have to give them to Zoey on her ""food blanket"" so the grease doesn't get on the carpet, resulting in Zoey licking the carpet. That doesn't bother me too much, as it's a precaution I take with all food, chews, and treats.But, Zoey loves them, takes her a minute or so to eat a pattie. And as a natural treat, they can't be beat. Far better than most doggie junk food that passes as treats these days, you know?"
1,DO NOT ORDER - They CHEAT YOU!!!,The description CLEARLY states a 75 pack nad ONLY 5 ship!! ONLY 5. They are rip off artists.Do not order from this company.
1,false advetising,"I made the mistake of purchasing this item. I actually ordered two. You can imagine my surprise when I only received two five-pack and not the 150 indiidual patties like I thought. Working at a local pet store, this particular item do sell individually and in packs of five. I see that Amazon or someone rather had inserted January 2007 next to the item on the main frame. That was not there when I made my purchase. I believe that the company that sent the product should have honored the promotion if they want repeat business o at least give a credit."
5,Great for allergic dogs,"My grandson brought these over for my sheltie who has developed an allergy to the treats we were using. My dog absolutely loves them (we only give him half of one at a time because they're so large. The texture helps clean his teeth, and his allergies have totally cleared up. These are definitely the best!"
4,An insightful personal account of the Vietnam War,"Author Stuart Herrington got unique insights on the underlying causes of the Vietnam War by debriefing several Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers who were captured or surrendered. He also learned effective ways of fighting the enemy, and how the South Vietnamese government (and the U.S.) inevitably lost the war by failing to change.This book should be of great interest Vietnam veterans and others who wonder why we ""lost"" the Vietnam War despite the vast amounts of money, time and lives we devoted to the fight."
3,Could be a little better....,"I use this siphon to empty the gas tanks on my lawn mower and my snow blower when the seasons change. It does a great job, but after 2 seasons, the pump part seems to be worn through.I will need to buy a new one when the seasons change again. It looks like the connector point at the hose and the pump is worn. I'm guessing they could have used better glue for this product."
3,Siphon pump?,Service was great..fast shipment. The siphon pump however is about useless. The priming bulb is of cheap stiff plastic and really is of poor quality. I would say don't waste your money.
2,Works but leaks,"It leaks a bit where the hose connects to the hand pump. As a result, my hands got wet with gasoline. It is just made very cheaply."
2,JUNK,"I GOT THIS FOR XMAS 2003 WORKS WITH SONY CDRS THAT SAY DIGITAL AUDIO ,SAYS IN YHE CRAPPY MANUEL THAT IT WONT RECORD FROM DIGITAL SOURCE,ARE THEY KIDDING EVERY THING IS DIGITAL TODAY.NOW THE RECORD TRAY ONLY OPENS HALF WAY, HAVE TO MANUALY CLOSE THEN IT WONT ENGAGE,THIS IS A CRAPPY MACHINE.DONT BUY EVEN FOR 50 BUCKS IT LOOKS GOOD BUT THATS IT."
4,absolutely dance,"After the great success of ""First Time"", Offer Nissim keeps the high quality in music for dancing. This time he has got the wonderful reunion of Maya, Beyonce and Suzane Palmer. If you are interested in Dance Music, the name is now Offer Nissim!"
1,DONT BUY IT!,This game is dead. NCsoft shut it down. These people who are selling it just want to steal you money...
1,Don't Bother.,"This pre-order is NOT worth it. There are only a few beta slots left. You will NOT get in more than two days before release. Just buy the game and play the day it opens. If you want the special item, buy the collector's DVD edition."
3,Interesting but frustrating,"The interesting part is Beijing; the frustrating part, Megan. We get way too much of her effort at a star turn. Still, you can come away with some sense of Beijing, if you're able to muster some patience with her."
3,"Not bad, not great","I am a bookkeeper and having trouble putting together the entire Accounting Cycle (computer software hides too many steps). This book might be OK if you are taking a class & need to ""memorize answers,"" but it did not help me to truly understand..."
3,Satiric and Strange,"This collection took a bit for me to warm to, but eventually I did. I wasn't a huge fan of the first two stories but after that, I got interested. So if you like strange satiric writings, try this collection of short stories."
4,It is to laugh... and then feel really queasy,"Does this guy Saunders have a lock on the proto-futuristic-pre-wasteland-alternate-present-reality thing, or what? Is anything not made of plastic or human flesh in his world -- where the two seem as interchangeable as they are disposable? Do his characters not sport wounds that puss and spume but refuse to bleed?Just wow. His stories make the lower gut ache at the thought of what this consumerist culture of ours might render, once the oil's gone and we've completely lost the ability to tell good stories on film; and the way things are going, that's gonna be next year, folks..."
4,Theme parks in bad decline,"It's hard to tell if George Saunders' worldview is relentlessly bleak, or if he's creating bleak worlds to show us that ours isn't so bad. His characters are trapped in situations that are infinitely escapable -- or perhaps they're not. There's also a curious religious component to these tales. The lead story, ""Pastoralia,"" repeats Saunders' obsession with fake theme parks. Although the stories here don't have quite the same impact as in ""CivilWarLand,"" they still bring you face to face with your own life choices and your own, dare I say it, whining about life. Evaluation forms figure prominently in these stories as well."
2,A disappointment,"Pastoralia is only a forgettable book when compared to the vast majority of works being published nowadays, but is a huge disappointment when compared with Saunders' debut novel, Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Only one short story from Pastoralia -- Sea Oak -- lives up to the Civilwarland's originative creativity. Those who build Pastorlia up into something of an esteemed work are followers of hero-worship, not followers of good satire."
2,modern life is rubbish,"In my experience, people with really provincial taste in literature like Saunders because they think he's ""edgy."" He's funny, I guess, and if you only read the New Yorker and Best American Short Stories, his plots are unusual, even original. Even better, he sniffs at suburban consumer culture, painting it in the most garish colors imaginable. What's an overeducated, culturally aspirational hipster not to love?Many other reviewers here call Saunders ""compassionate,"" which seems really very wrong to me. The characters are so broadly drawn that it's hard not to think he's offering them up to us as figures of ridicule or even scorn. He never forces his readers out of their comfort zones, to actually feel something for or maybe -- gasp! -- identify with his grotesques.Compassion is hard, and these stories take the easy ways out. Saunders can find it if he wants, but until then I suggest his readers look for it too. Elsewhere."
1,Losers & Whiners learn to Hope,"I was stuck on a plane with no other book to read or I would never have finished this one. The first story of people as theme park exhibits reminded me of Star Trek episode with Orwellian overtones. You can only save yourself by betraying others, and the life you are saving yourself for is probably not worth the self laothing. Perhaps the stories are well written, but the themes are so off-putting that they detract from any enjoyment."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Apparently anyone looking on down to trash culture and throwing in enough vulgarity can get a great review these days. There are some genuinely funny moments, but overall these stories are as empty and unsatisfying as a can of E-Z Cheez."
1,A big 00,"This is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of buying. The stories are juvenile, stupid, shallow, idiotic, immature, repetitive (especially in the stupid phrases incessantly repeated in the lead story Pastoralia) and poorly written, unless the author is 12 years old or younger. To me, the book has no redeeming value of any kind. I am going to Email the Chicago Tribune and complain about the critic who recommended this book. Amazon should come up with some kind of rating system that would warn unsuspecting buyere about this kind of book. Something like: 1. Highly recommended, 2. Recommended 3. Recommended for those with half a brain or less 4. Recommended for burial (at least six feet under) so it will never again see the light of day."
4,For pure entertainment,"Pastoralia is a wonderful collection of imaginative, satirical, and often ridiculous short stories. Saunders imagination knows no bounds and he successfully makes the most unreal scenarios seem real. But he often fails to put characters into these scenarios that we can really relate to - they are quite often characatures, just as ridiculous as their environment and as a result left me feeling unmoved by many of the stories. (There are exceptions - The Falls for example is very moving.) Many of these short pieces are nothing more than some very well made, very sweet candy - very enjoyable at the moment but soon forgotten. I suppose that's not really a criticism unless you are looking for some life-changing piece of literature - for pure entertainment you would be hard pressed to find anything better than Pastoralia."
5,Rolling on the floor laughing my...,"This man is genuinely funny and breaks your heart at the same time. Impeccably crafted prose. Puts all the MFA my-childhood-was-unhappy-and-now-my-thesis-advisor-doesn't-understand-me whiners to shame. Buy, read, laugh, enjoy."
4,NEEDS SOMETHING,"Enjoyable read, but lacking something. With each story I was looking for another page or two. I don't have to have nice & tidy endings but would like a better feel for the author's intent.This was my first exposure to Saunders and I'll try more. Maybe familiarity will breed concept."
5,Best of Sandy Posey,"To all you ladies out there, Born A Woman fits all of us. Sandy really hits the spot when she sings this song. For all you single ladies, listen to Single Girl. This CD really brings back memories. I know you will all enjoy this CD. Give it a shot."
3,Good Girl Done Wrong,"In true Sandy Posey style, the listener is drawn into the sad world of a single girl or a woman in the 60's who loves her man, serves him and keeps on going.Whether you're listening to the hard life in being ""Born a Woman"", or about being the subject of gossip in ""The Boy I Love"" you can't help but be thankful that women have evolved to where being a ""Single Girl"" is not the hardship it was thirty years ago. This woman can sing and you really believe her when she says she was ""Shattered"". Don't listen to this CD if you are having a blue day!"
3,"Good special effects, horrible dubbing...","This was a mediocore movie to say the most. Its your typical ""our teacher is an alien"" story--but she really is. Its not really creative, not really that entertaining, and the voice-overs are really awful for some of the characters. The storyline is bland. I think they spent the whole budget on the special effects, which were actually kind of cool although there were not that many of them. So far its at the bottom of my ghosthouse movies, but then again there are a few of them I'm not even going to bother with (the reeker for instance)..."
2,alien comes to earth becomes teacher nothing new about this,the whole premise of this movie is nothing new. the director had an alien come to earth take on the form a sixth grade teacher to help her species survive by learning about love. this movie was hard to watch because the characters mouths and vocies were dubbed so they did not line up. the ending was the best part out of the whole movie. I would say worth renting but not worth spending hard earned money on to own. the ghosthouse underground first collection seems like they would be worth while watching but so far the only one that was worth owning would be dance of the dead. This being it has to do with zombies and I am a zombie fan.
4,Strange & Fun,"I had seen a preview of ""The Substitute"" on another DVD and wasn't impressed. However, upon finding it cheap at a used bookstore I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.""The Substitute"" is a fun & strange little piece of Sci-Fi that borrows elements from several other better known movies and blends them together to make something unique. There's no doubt to the kids in the film that something is a little off with their substitute teacher, but their parents are completely blind to it. If the film didn't have some bad language in it, it would be perfect for a younger audience who could definitely relate to the kids in the film. It still makes for solid entertainment for a slightly older crowd though.Those viewers who need graphic violence and sex in their movies will be disappointed as ""The Substitute"" contains neither. Its strength lies in its seemingly familiar plotline that veers off into unexpected directions."
1,"""The Substitute"" should have stayed in space","I've read mostly positive things about this sci-fi movie, and after watching it I have no idea why. It's mostly boring, stupid, and lame. If it weren't for a few f-bombs it could've been rated PG. If you want to see an alien movie set in school, watch The Faculty. Now that's a cool flick!"
3,Good guide for the bride to be,"This is a book that is more suited as a guide for the bride to be on how to decide on a cake, choose a baker, etc. It has some beautiful and unusual cakes by a variety of cake designers for those looking for ideas. However, there weren't as many cakes as I had hoped."
2,high price for mediocore coffee table book,"If you are looking for ideas on cake decorating, this is not the book for you. It has some nice cake pictures but basically just information that in my opinion is common sense for most people. It is a chatty book that is being sold as a cookbook and guide to aid in knowlegably selecting the wedding cake of your dreams. It does not live up to its promises. What I am wondering is if she sold space for adveritizing as this seems to be the main purpose for this book. If you want names of bakers, florists etc in your area (if you live in or near a metropolitan area) that this author has worked with, this might be a good resource for you. This book does not live up to the synopsis or the lovely cover. Planning a wedding and need a wedding cake or just looking for decorating ideas and info the new Martha Stewart book on wedding cakes is lovely and worth checking out."
1,"Besides the Recipes, Not Worth to Buy","This book only covers a general description of cake decoration and a bunch of pictures but it lacks the ""how to do it"" which is the main reason why most of us buy these kind of books as we learn by reading/practicing the how to's. Some of the advise in this book I have learned over the internet for free. Similar cakes' pictures are all over the internet. There are NO INSTRUCTIONS TO DECORATE THE CAKES! I think that to look for cakes' pictures all I have to do is browse the internet and costs nothing but the monthly internet service fee."
2,Not a good choice if you're looking for ideas for your cake,I chose this book because I'm getting married in June and I have no idea what I want my cake to look like. I thought this book would be filled with pages of designs...I was very disappointed.
2,Academic interest only.,Both of these symphonies are second teir compositions of early 20th Century music. Adequate orchestrations but lacking in compelling melodic interest to warrant return listenings. The second is better than the first. The first sounds very much like a student composition. The recordings sounded very good.
1,Some good nuggets but lacking over all,I used this book along with many others in my Ministry if the Family class at Lee University. The book has some useful material but not worth reading cover to cover. It is a very unambitious work and offers little to no information that could not be found by even picking up and skimming other text. I suggest FAMILY DRIVEN FAITH by Dr. Voddie Baucham Jr. as a more inspirational and challenging approach to family ministry.-Tom
4,shabby shipping,Item arrived without hardware to install. No easy way to contact seller to resolve issue.
1,unprofessional,I bought these DVD's because I thought they would be a great workout. The quality of the workout is terrible. There was no cool down to the workout. It seemed to just be two girlfriends who wanted to workout together poolside and decided to record it and sell it. The video spends most of the time zoomed in on the womans face and you usually cannot see what she is doing. Then there is no transition to the next workout. She is already in position and doing what you are supposed to be doing. Her explanations are minimal and since the video is zoomed in on her face you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing. This DVD was a waste of money. I am sure there are better Pilates DVD's out there.
4,A GREAT POP SINGER OF THE 60'S,"THIS GAL RELEASED SOME GREAT SONGS. SHE FELL ON THE SAME STYLE AS WANDA JACKSON, JO ANN CAMPBELL,ETC. SHE FELL ON THE POP MUSIC CHARTS WITH SONGS LIKE ""NORMAN"", ""JAMES, HOLD THE LADDER STEADY"", ""PAPER TIGER"" AND ""SAD MOVIES MAKE ME CRY"" WHICH ARE FINALLY OURS, THANKS TO THIS C.D.!!! YOU'LL LOVE SUE THOMPSON'S STYLE AND THIS C.D. BRINGS BACK SOME GREAT TUNES AND MEMORIES.SUE THOMPSON FALLS IN THE 60'S GIRLS CATEGORY.DON'T MISS THIS LONG AWAITED GEM!!"
4,For casual and hardcore fans alike,"Given the topsy-turvy fortunes of this underappreciated band, it was a surprise to come across a book devoted to the backstory and recording of every Squeeze song. But while the book, which presents Chris Difford's and Glenn Tilbrook's memories and opinions on every song they wrote together, will no doubt please Squeeze fans (such as me), any afficionado of Britpop, pop or rock music, or songwriting in general will appreciate this book. It describes the nuances of the writing process, unlikely sources of inspiration, and happy accidents of the production process. It also shows why partnerships between two equally talented, complementary yet contradictory personalities rarely survive the long term. One quibble: While every Squeeze song is discussed, the lyrics for some of the songs are missing. If you're hoping to read the correct lyrics to ""annie Get Your Gun,"" for instance, you're out of luck."
3,"Fascinating, but","Drury could have provided a bit more context and perspective, rather than just tossing whiffle balls at Glenn and Chris. Still, it's better than nothing and serves as a powerful reminder of just how great Squeeze was."
3,Interesting Introduction,"After seeing Squeeze in concert this past summer I realized I knew almost nothing about the inception of this band or the lives of its founders Glenn Tilbrook & Chris Difford. Although I would have preferred a more in depth biography, the book provides an interesting introduction."
4,made me read everything she's written,"As a study in character and culture, it was excellent. I read and savored it as I learned about a different cultural view. Because of this book I have gone back to read other books by this author as she certainly is a class above most mystery writers who are aiming strictly for a ""who-done-it"" plot drive piece of fluff."
4,An attention-grabbing read,"""Deception on His Mind"" was my second Elizabeth George novel, and it won't be my last. It was great having Havers in the spotlight in this latest novel -- she is quickly becoming my favorite. Good plotlines and a well-written story are once again in evidence here, athough I was a bit disappointed in the ending. I find myself still wondering what happened to Sahlah and Theo. I am also curious to see what becomes of Barbara's new relationship with her neighbors, and most especially what kind of turn her career will take. I'm looking forward to finding out, and I will definitely be coming back for more when she releases her next novel."
2,Not her Best!,"Deception on His Mind, by Elizabeth George is a good mystery because the author is a great mystery writer. There's plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing as to who did what, but like the last book of hers I read, What Happened Before He Shot Her, this one too is loaded with inaccuracies about the faith of Islam and the different tribal traditions of the Pakistanis and the Arabs. The scenes she created among the Pakistanis were interesting, but unfortunately too many of them were Hindu and not Muslim. Elizabeth George is a great writer, but trying to use her mysteries to create a better understanding of the minorities is not working. Well Schooled in Murder was one of her best books because it was very British, something she obviously knows very well. As I said, this was a good read, but would have been loads better if she either had better research or more knowledge of the subjects she was writing about."
3,"It was good, but it could have been better","As a longtime fan of thriller/mystery/suspense novels, this book didn't entrance me as my favorite authors seem to captivate my attention. The characters all seem too flat, no development at all...I liked the unexpected revelations that Barbara and Emily discover, but the reader doesn't really seem to be pulled along the plot...I think one of the problems is that there were so many characters to handle that the reader doesn't really get to know who Barbara is...In comparison to my favorite authors who include John Sandford, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, and Patricia Cornwell, Elizabeth George is an ok read, but not spectacular."
2,"pare it down, please!","I would have given this book a rating of 1 out of 5, except that the plot was interesting. This is the third Elizabeth George book I have read, but I couldn't get through this one. The author has an obsessive compulsive style of writing that is irritating--every bite taken, every sip taken--is added as a boring beat, until I want to scream, get on with the story--move it along! Finally, when I realized there were at least 300 more pages to go, I skipped to the end. This author would benefit from an editor who would dare to tell her to cut out a lot needless, uninteresting details. I do think she has good plots, but I don't think I'll be buying any more of her books."
1,Just awful,Probably the worst mystery I have read. The author takes forever to develop the plot and then introduces twists and turns that keep the story going long after it has exhausted any energy it had. The characters prove shallow and so does the ending. You'll never guess the ending because it's so improbable and illogical. Only at my wife's insistence did I finish this poor excuse for a story. I'm sorry I wasted my time. Try another writer--any other writer.
4,Tightly plotted mystery with sociological analysis inferred.,"752 pages seemed daunting, but this book was one of those ""cannot put it down"" mystery whodunits. Nicely involved murder with character development both surprising and appreciated. After the first dozen pages, Inspector Lynley was there only in the thoughts of Detective Barbara Havers, so concentrating on her development as a character was solidly entertaining. The analysis of Pakistan and English interactions (set in late 1990's) was obviously well researched and nicely explained."
3,So Many Pages,"Some SpoilersAt over 700 pages the story became too overwrought. The ending with the boat chase seemed too contrived.The characters are interesting for the most part and the Muslim plot added interest. But some of the interplay became tiresome. What was the point of the dying Agathe scenes? The eight year old Hadiyyah didn't connect with me. What was she doing all day long while her father was with the main culprit Mohannad? And why were there so many culprits?As one reviewer mentioned, Sherlock Holmes solved most of his case with forty pages."
3,Havers should butt out or in -- that is the question.,"Elizabeth George is the first mystery author that I read who tried to handle the Pakistani population problem in Great Britain. Since that time I've read several and always come to the conclusion that is any vehicle without to lay blame on the white racial colonial system that existed before we were born.Barbara Havers finds an idol whose investigation of a murder is tinged with racial overtones. She is shocked and hurt to discover the woman detective has feet of clay, but it becomes funny when one remembers earlier volumes where Havers damn every man who walked.Georges' main characters are strong and vivid, but her grasp of social commentary is shallow.The earlier books in the series are much better mysteries.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,George's best novel!,"I'm fan of Elisabeth George's novels and I really think this is her best. Not only it is well written and full of suspence but the end is really a surprise and political themes are adressed in a very intelligent manner. And I must say Barbara Havers is really my favourite character - we don't miss Linley for a second! Actually, in ""In the porsuit of the propper sinner"" we can again see Havers following her own way."
4,An unsual ending,"I absolutely love E. George's books and I own them all. Her character development and concurrent plots make the books difficult to put down. I was engrossed in this story - there were so many sub plots that screamed out for resolution that I couldn't wait to get to the end. I love Sgt. Havers (she is my favorite character) and thought she was fabulous in this book. However, the ending felt rushed, the motive was very stupid and not worth all the terrific storytelling that went before it. None of the sub plots that I was most interested in got resolved (what happened to the pregnant girl?) But I must say that the waiting to discover what happened next to Havers was unbearable. I couldn't wait for the day the book came out. This was definitely one of George's best works - until the end. Maybe she was feeling pressure from the publisher, who knows?"
5,Favorite,"This is my favorite Eliz. George--and I like them all a lot. Barbara Havers is a welcome change--a real type person with endearing (to me) flaws. May I have some more, please? Top notch story."
4,a surprise,"I liked it, in spite of myself. I usually like ""oldfashioned"" British murder mysteries, and certainly nothing withalot of sexuality. But this drew me in, regardless. Also, instead of being disappointed that Lynley wasn't evident, I was pleasantly surprised that it dealt mainly with Havers. I agree that there were a few loose ends, but I have to say, that all in all, in spite of my reservations, this was a welcome surprise. END"
5,"George's books are all fabulous, intriging, and exciting.","I love all of George's book-the fact that she uses the same characters makes you feel as if you know them really well. The plots are ever surpising, and each character plays such a unique role. I love all of the characters, and the fact that they are so close knit.I love the background of where the story takes place , the country is marvelous and fascinating. She can't write fast enough to suit me."
3,A political novel masquerading as a murder mystery,"I am a raving fan of Elizabeth George's mystery writing, but this book is neither fish nor fowl. It reads like a political novel exploring Britain's deep ambivalence about East Asian immigrants. George follows so many characters and conflicts that I lost the sense of the mystery. One hundred fewer pages would have been most welcome! Barbara Havers stars alone in this one - I missed Lynley."
2,Surprised at all the positive reviews for this novel,"I bought this novel as ""holiday reading,"" and, having nothing else, read it to the end. I was disappointed, however. It's not on a par with George's other novels. I agree with the reviewers who say that the characters are one-dimensional and that the ending (both the boat chase and the revelation about who killed the victim) are over-dramatic and unbelievable. I also agree that too many threads are left hanging. The writer doesn't have to describe everyone's future in detail, but some suggestion as to how their lives will continue, once this book ends, would be welcome.One more pet peeve: George introduces too many ""Americanisms"" into her characters' speech. I've nothing against Americanisms, but as a rule people in England just don't speak like that. (I know: I lived in England for many years). A good editor should catch those before the book goes to print."
3,Not up to previous high standards,"Too long, too boring, no Lynley & St. James. If Ms. George wants to stray from her strong main characters, why not explore St. James & Deborah...one of the most interesting couples in fiction. Imagine the TV series: older, experienced, intelligent, disabled hero; beautiful, younger, intelligent heroine. What about the two women - Mrs. Lynley & Mrs. St. James. As each has been the lover of the other's husband, this would mak for some interesting conversation! Barbara bores me"
3,poorly edited,"The book was too long. Better editing would have helped some, but the characters were a drag. Though I finished the book, about half way through I frankly didn't give a dam. P.D. James has spoiled me"
2,Bloated,"The book could've been cut by a third, at least. I got tired of all the whining about the heat, and about how women on the police force-without fail-are always treated poorly by men. The author tosses in many asides that are meant to be wry, no doubt, but she's not often successful. I'm not looking for a 1st-grade primer, but 600 pages? Please get to the point already."
2,Overlong and predictable,"What is supposed to be a mystery ends up being a 700-page diatribe on racism and intolerance. George has always been a favorite author of mine because of the relationships between the detectives and their former/current lovers, i.e. Lynley and St. James. By focusing the book on Barbara Havers, the least interesting character, and leaving Lynley out in the cold, the series is weakened. However, at least we were spared another visit to Barbara's aging mother! The murderer was obvious from the beginning as were the motivations of the other suspects. All in all, a disappointment. To really appreciate how George can craft a compelling mystery, you'd have to go back to For the Sake of Elena or Well-Schooled in Murder. Her last several books have been long-winded and predictable, and Deception on His Mind is no exception."
2,Exhausting,"I plowed through this with my boots on. By the middle of the book it was interesting but not an easy read. That would have been ok, except by the time I waded through 600+ pages, I find she just zips up the book. There should have been even more pages! After all this, we are left with unanswered questions. If there is a sequel, I won't bother."
3,"Compelling plot, unlikeable characters","This was the first E. George book I have read. I found the plot compelling, but the continual references to the racism of the community and characters was very tiring. The overt racism was the kind you would find in small town USA in the 1950s. Is it really this bad in England? I felt some of the characters were too one-dimensional (no redeeming qualities) and found the character of Emily inconsistent, especially at the end. The author gave us some insight into the Pakistani culture, but I didn't get the idea that she found anything positive about it.I am going to read ""For the Sake of Elena"" to give the author another chance."
3,My least favorite of hers,"I usually find George's novels such page-turners that I can forgive a lot of so-called imperfections. This was an exception. For an American, she seems to understand quite a bit (if not everything) about English culture and some English-subculture, but she was unable to get under the skin of the mostly-Pakistani characters in this novel. Even the likeable Sahlah was two-dimensional and remote. Her deformed friend was pathetic and embarrassing. George needs to limit her ""ethnic"" characters if she doesn't understand them."
3,Got bogged down in the middle,"I liked the setting; George used the overpowering heat very effectively. I also liked the variety of characters, but the plot really lost its momentum by the middle of the book. Perhaps there were just too many characters; there were certainly way too many loose ends. If you are going to have entire chapters devoted to the inner thoughts of secondary players (Rachel, Agatha, Cliff, etc.) you need to have more closure. It almost seemed that George didn't quite think that Havers was interesting enough on her own without Lynley and his aristo pals. I did like Emily Barlow a lot and hope we see her again. So, a good one, but not her best."
3,Read her other novels first.,"This is the fourth novel that I've read from Elizabeth George and I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed with this novel. The first 200 pages are slow reading and I had a difficult time getting into this book. I wasn't as captivated by her characters - in comparison to her other novels (In Pursuit of Proper Sinner, For the Sake of Elena, Playing for the Ashes). The character analysis and depctions are not as indepth and rich as some of her other characters from her other books. Otherwise, I still will read more of George's novels because I loved the other 3."
4,deception aplenty,"The possible murder of businessman and soon-to-be married Haytham Querashi causes an uproar in the Pakistani community in England, who do not trust the police to fairly conduct their investigation. While her partner Lynley is (thankfully) on his honeymoon, Detective Barbara Havers joins up with her old school friend Emily Barlow to investigate the death. Tensions flare between a local Pakistani activist, who happens to be the cousin of her neighbor, who is mediating, and the English-born detectives. A pregnancy, underlying racism and classism, an extortion ring and a kidnapping help make this book a fast-paced and absorbing read. However, some important plot threads are left dangling, most importantly the pregnant widow. Did she have an abortion? If not, will her family still accept her? Why go to all the trouble of developing a character, if you're going to deprive the reader of her fate."
5,An excellent read!,"Elizabeth George never fails to intrique. She supplies all the clues but encourages the reader to arrive at the wrong conclusions. As usual I was sure that the chief suspect of the police was the wrong one, and I was equally sure that I had targeted the guilty party. -- However, the sure-fire guilty party changed with every chapter! I can't wait to start another George book and try my sleuthing skills again."
4,Racial tensions,"While her boss Thomas Lynley is away on his honeymoon, Sergeant Barbara Havers spends recovery time after being the victim of a shooting, on a so-called holiday at Balford-le-Nez, a seaside community with a growing population of Asians. She joins forces with a former colleagus Emily Barlow, who has been recently promoted to the rank of Detective Chief Inspector, and whom Barbara admires greatly for her superior police work.The body of a recent Pakhistani immigrant has been discovered on the beach and has been identified as the man brought to England as the prospective husband of the daughter of the towns' wealthiest businessman. The son of the businessman is intent on raising racial conflict in the town, leaving the police to wonder at his motives.It's a good murder/mystery story with plenty of twists and turns and, although rather wordy, is nevertheless a good, long read."
4,You have the wrong picture on your Greatest hits,"The Picture that you have on the cover,is not Ted Taylor, and I think you need to correct it. I have no idea who that person is. I will wait until they make the correction before I purchased the item. How can they make such a big mistake. Ted was my relative."
3,Not bad. Not Fantastic.,"One jar was leaking and it tastes a bit weird but after all it is ""curry in a jar."" My sweetheart wants me to make all my curries from scratch instead of making them out of jars."
2,Terrible sound quality,"It is always possible that my copy is a misprint, but the sound quality of it is miserable. It's as if there is no right channel, the whole stage is off balance. Sound depth is not particularly impressive. Apart from these serious omissions the quality of playing is rather sound, Papavrami is a noteworthy and accomplished violinist and the orchestra also is rather good. These violin concertos are considered to be among the best of the last century. Unfortunatally the recording is so lousy!"
4,Pretty creepy for low low budget,"Basic ripofff of Paranormal Activity but really cool and creepy considering it was very low budget, i liked it alot"
2,this was a waste of time,"i should of listen to my gut,this was the worst ripp off i seen this year...thank god it was 2.00 bucks..."
1,About an hour too long...,"An attempt at a ""hand-held camera"" horror mockumentary that was way too slow.There were a couple of good bits, but the scene with the guy in black wearing the poorly fitting Halloween mask, and the scene with the little girl wearing poorly applied makeup really killed it for us. The clincher was the lame ending... what happened to the main characters? What happened to the original family members?If the producers had spent a few bucks on a more realistic mask for the masked guy and a first rate makeup artist for the little girl, and wrote an actual ending, it could have been a much better film and we wouldn't have felt like we wasted 88 minutes of our lives."
5,Baker Street review,"It was an extremely enjoyable movie. I enjoyed the casual dialog, the offhand humor, and the edgy critical moments. It had danger, suspense, and peril, and I felt like I was there - inside this risky, precarious, conflict. It had an awesome soundtrack. Congrats."
1,Big disappointment- Stupid movie,Movie started out slow..first half hour is worthless..movie gets a little better in the middle but the ending makes no sense and its for sure not scarey. I wouldnt watch this movie if it was free. Not worth your time.
2,Good movie... the end sucks,I enjoyed the movie until the end. The end is total joke and makes no sense....Total cop out. There is very little explanation in what happens.
3,Found footage,"Hokey but actually pretty well acted.Odd premise, odd special effects, worthy effortBetter than some of the higher production value movies out there"
4,Needs table of symbols,"In a book that is heavily mathematic, it is very useful to have a table of symbols (i.e., a key) to refer to. However, this text not only has no such table, but the author often fails to define the symbols he uses! He cannot assume that the symbols he uses are so standard that the reader will already be familiar with them. Also, he even often fails to define his terms directly, but relies on homonyms in subsequent sentences, and apparently expects the reader to infer the meaning, and to know that he refers to the previous concept. However, this can lead to many misunderstandings and impedes the progress of learning substantially."
4,Very good computational EM reference,Used the book as reference to learn Computational Electromagnetics Methods
3,neophyte,"very good musicians but they miss out on several critical elements of Ladino music; not Moorish enough, missing Jewish liturgical element."
2,Not a very good guide...,"I took the ASA 101 course and a lot of the material that was asked on the test was not emphasized in the book. I found it very dry, somewhat scattered and generally not enjoyable from which to learn.I've only skimmed through New Complete Sailing Manual by Steve Sleight and that book looks like it might be a lot easier to understand."
2,"Disorganized, poorly edited","This is one of the most disorganized and poorly edited books Ihave ever read. There are sentences that get truncated from onepage to the next, concepts that supposedly will be explained ""inthe next chapter"" and never are, totally unrelated topics thatare jumbled together, material that is repeated without a clearreason, obscure and/or poor illustrations/photos, etc.Some radical editing could probably turn this book intosomething useful, but as is I would recommend that the beginningsailor turn to one of the many introductory books on sailingthat are better written and illustrated."
5,Sailing Fundamentals,"For the last 20 years, my student feedback has been very good. They like the pictures, the pace, and the level. The self tests at the end of the chapters help them get ready to take a very comprehensive written exam. By using this textbook, my pass rate on this exam is above 90%. Then they use and enjoy the practice water excercises to develop their water skills. Prior to using this book, my students felt very intimidated by the sailing mystic. This book is user friendly. Of all the textbooks that have been written on sailing, the US Coast Guard Auxillary picked and approved this text to be used in their courses. I believe their seal on the front cover says alot about the quality of the contents."
4,ASA Manual,This is a very basic and fundamental book with well presented information that is a necessary book in the American Sailing Association.
3,Alright for beginners,"The book is pretty BASIC, and for beginners it's a least the minimum that you need to know before hop on !!!! Tells you a little bit of everything, but if you looking something more especific or deep in details, definally IS NOT the right one !!!!Really good to know boats part and names though !!!!"
2,Poorly organized but adequate,"I received this book with a basic keel boating class. This was the second book I read on boating, and I found it much worse than the first (The Complete Sailor by David Seidman). While this book covers many topics, it is poorly organized. The diagrams are next to useless. While it may cover all the topics of the ASA exam, I would not buy it if I were not taking the exam."
2,"Poorly organized, poorly edited, generally not great","I recently got a copy of this book to take my ASA sailing certificate. Unfortunately, this book is really poor. The information is good, but it's poorly organized. It's completely full of typos (like the page where they were talking about ""boast"" instead of ""boats""), sentences which end in the middle, pictures of knots that are incomplete (and therefore, not knots), and my personal favorite, instructions on folding a sail where the pictures start with a folded sail, and end with an unfolded one. If you looking to buy a book on sailing, look elsewhere. Try the Anapolis Book of Seamanship."
1,Don't waste your money,Get Sailing Made Easy its far superior to Sailing Fundamentals. The 1 star reviews are correct. I made the mistake of buying Sailing fundamentals twice. Once when I was trying to learn sailing on my own and the 2nd time it was included in my sailing class. The book is very cumbersome and does not flow logically.
2,I'm not sure this book has anything to do with fundamentals,"I'm not sure this book has anything to do with true fundamentals, but it is a basic, run of the mill sailing book. It's probably worth a read, but there are serious voids that could stand to be filled by other books. The big glaring void is the complete ommission of the attitude required to handle a sailboat wholly under sail, the book assumes power assist. I'd recommend picking up a book by FitzGerald, especially Wind and Tide, as this precious little volume will make a good suppliment."
5,Great basic learn-to-sail book!,"Being new to sailing, I purchased the book before I started taking sailing lessons so I would be familiar with the terms, concepts, etc. With highlighter in-hand, I carefully combed through the book. It prepared me very well.My instructor usually hands out the same book during the first class. Since I already carefully read it (he quizzed me), rather than spending a lot of time in class going over the terms etc., I spent the time sailing; gaining hands-on sailing experience.It's a great book for the beginning sailor."
5,Ready About!,"One of the best basic sailing manuals I've seen - I bought a copy for each member of my crew. If you want to learn how to sail the right way, and quickly, this is your book."
4,A good basic sailing book,My husband and I are taking sailing classes. This book is the text used my most American Sailing Association schools. It is easy to read and does a good job of illustrating principles and techniques.
2,Lots of unuseful information right off the start.,"I got this book so I could have a teaching aid to help my girlfriend learn to sail. It starts off with all this info about jet skis and hull shapes instead of sailing fundamentals. I persisted with the book and the exercises were helpful, but was pretty disappointed. It's a pretty dry read and overly wordy."
1,PATHETIC...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"The publisher and editor should be ashamed for producing this book. As an editor, I'm embarrassed for them. Sailing is a terrific sport and I sincerely hope that the poor unsuspecting souls who bought this book expecting clear, concise, and organized instruction, are not turned off. Sentences are missing, typos abound, illustrations are incomplete. AND, those folks who gave this book a glowing review need to have their eyes checked. IF YOU PURCHASED THIS BOOK, RETURN IT AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK (I did)."
4,Another Perfect Sailing Primer,"I used this book as a companion book to another text for learning to sail on the Hudson, and I found it to be a thorough and informative text, with all basic information on rules of the road, parts of a boat, parts of a sail, rigging, water safety and rules of the road.As a beginning sailor, learning on a responsive boat with a sail and a jib, I would recommend this book to anyone learning to sail smaller craft and slower craft. By my second lesson, this book and the companion I used allowed me to gain the comfort necessary to prepare for my basic keelboat certification."
2,Needs an edit,"Although the content of this book is useful, it is a difficult read because of poor editing. There are numerous typographical errors which could easily be corrected. Occasionally, there are terms used that have not been defined, although synomyms have been (e.g. ""forestay"" is referenced but only ""headstay"" is defined). However, one of the most cumbersome problems to deal with is the reference to illustrations. Illustrations are not numbered which makes it more difficult to find the proper one to look at on many pages where there are multiples. Additionally, there are numbered objects referenced in the text that do not appear with numbers in the illustrations. Certainly, with effort one can work their way through the text and learn from it, but it could be much smoother to do with a small amount of work from an editor."
1,too hastily assembled by the ASA...,"Very poorly edited & proofread; numerous errors & omissions make for distracting & frustrating reading that undermines confidence in the material. Buy, read and enjoy ""The Complete Sailor"" instead."
3,It's ok,"Nice watch, but I am disappointed in that it doesn't keep good time. I would have expected more from Seiko. I guess to get a good GMT watch it will cost lots."
5,I Love This CD!,"A friend of mine had this record back when we were in College, and I've been looking for it for years to come out on CD. I ordered it and was not disappointed - it was just as good as I remembered. There are a lot of gems on this CD, good recording quality, and great musicians. Although my review isn't as scholarly as the previous, I think anyone who likes blues, especially electric blues with horns and electric guitars, will love this album."
2,Rare for a reason,"T. Bone sounds burnt out to me on this one. I'm a huge T. Bone Walker fan but this album was done very late in his career and doesn't have the same flavor as his earlier work. The style is too modern. Although, the version of Stormy Monday isn't bad, you can't beat the orginal versions of most of these songs. This album sounds like it was done by a washed out lounge singer. As you can already guess, I would not have purchased this CD if I had listened to it first. Spend your money wisely and purchase some earlie T. Bone."
1,The Design of Steam Boilers and Pressure Vessels,This book was the most disappointing one I have ever purchased. I do not see how a publisher can deliberately OMIT nearly 200 drawings and still publish the book. This is a mechanical engineering book! How can you omit the drawings being discussed in the text? That is corrupt!-Don't buy this book! Never trust General Books LLC with another reproduction!
5,Great Puzzles,"These two puzzles are awesome. We bought them for my 4-year-old son before a family vacation, hoping it would keep him occupied while at the cabin. He loves puzzles, and was very excited when he saw these.They are well made wooden puzzles. Very colorful and fun to do.I would recommend these to any parent who needs fun, well made puzzles that will last for a long time."
4,colorful puzzle set,"These puzzles are beautifully done with vivid colors & design. The only negative comment is that the pieces come out with some difficulty the first time & on 2 of the pieces paper tore off & we had to glue it back on. I think its a matter of being very careful the first time. Otherwise, well done!"
5,Great way to occupy!,"I am very amazed that my 3 year old daughter can do these puzzles. We started with the 48 piece barn floor puzzle and the third time we worked on it, she did it herself. So I pulled out these puzzles and after showing her the edge pieces to start with, she mastered them alone. She did not get frustrated even though there is no picture to use as a reference. These puzzles are such a great price too! Unbeatable value in a toy!"
3,Pretty to look at,I purchased this set of two puzzles for my three year old grandson. I was very disappointed when my daughter-in-law told me the face of the pieces pealed off when they tried to get them out of the wooden frame for the first time. Puzzles were not cut properly at the manufacturer. This was not what I expected from a Melissa and Doug product.
3,"Good selection, good sound","I tend to review musical recordings that absolutely bowl me over, so I decided to break with the usual and review a truly mediocre recording. Here it is. This recording is well worth getting for the Brahms and Mendelssohn, but the Egmont and Figaro Overtures are way too fast. The sound quality is generally okay, but not overwhelmingly crisp. It's a good sampler, and cheap, so in that way is a fine introduction to famous overtures. It is enjoyable and generally pleasant. So, with this review out of the way, I can go back to reviewing recordings that are truly top notch, as I like to do."
3,Not what I expected,"This book wasn't what I expected. I thought it might providesome unique insight or good practices when working with WebLogic.Unfortunately, I think the code examples are sometimes poor and theydon't really go beyond the documentation that BEA already provides."
2,Where's the beef?,"This is becoming a trend with Worx. All examples, which are often of limited value, and no real meat to the book. They even spend a full chapter on describing a fake company that they are going to use to build examples for!I hate to say it but unless you cannot do without a book that says ""Weblogic"", you should do without this one!All talk, no action.... what a major disappointment!"
3,Good book to get a start using Bea Weblogic,"If you want to get a quick start using WebLogic, this is a good book. It takes you through an entire example. If you are looking for more insight into what is going on under the covers you will be disappointed. There is little explanation of the parameters in the properties file, little more than how to set it up for the example in the book. It starts to address some of the issues in architecting a J2EE application using WebLogic, but just skims the surface. If you have already some experience with WebLogic and are trying to gain more understanding, I would not recommend this book."
3,It could be better,"I'm a big WebLogic fun, but I'm really disappointed by this only book on the market about WebLogic. There are lots real-world stuff to be discussed about EJB, about WebLogic, which should be the focuse of a book like this one, but they are missing from the book. However, the chapters about the load testing is the best part of the book, which is also why I gave it 3 stars. I was expecting to see more ""real"" stuff about weblogic and EJB like these chapters.The book is also not a good introduction to J2EE for beginers, there are lots of other books and sites with tons of easy-to-read materials.Once again, I did not get anything out of this book other then the stress-testing part. But that several chapters only worth the money for me. I'm just hoping it could be better."
2,Waste of money!,Don't waste your money buying this book unless you are totally new to Weblogic and did not understand anything from lots of documents you can get at its web.
4,Very good book for developers new to Java based Web Apps,"I liked the way the authors use a common scenario, a company trying to make a traditional process (phone and fax based) appropriate for the Web. The authors help the reader think through moving a client server app to the web, and for many developers, that type of activity will be their first introduction to web programming with Java. The book doesn't get into any great technical details, and is not a book aimed at those who want to go into details of the WebLogic Server. The authors are programming J2EE, they use simple examples, that are meaningful. They do use some of the specific features of WebLogic, but WebSphere or any other J2EE compliant app server would do (that is kind of the point of J2EE, isn't it). They chose to target WebLogic, 'cause it is the best, on this point I agree."
3,Where is the Architecture?,"There is a chapter missing in this book: the target and resulting architectures. J2EE is based on a standard architectural framework and you would expect ""Mrs Chief Architect"" at the end of the development adventure to put all the objects invented in place back into the J2EE diagram so that some lesson may be learned on which objects were created where and why.I am still wondering why they have retired stored procedures to re-implement them as stateless java beans, why use container-based persistency when the SQL statements are actually the simplest and finally why did they extract perfectly good code from JSP to create the Stateful single ""Order"" EJB. It looks like they had to find something to populate the EJB part of the architecture ...."
1,what a waste!,please don't waste your money on this one. it is poorly written. it is outdated with the release of weblogic 6.0. the worst about this book is that all the examples are badly designed and implemented. it tells you the wrong way of program web applications.
2,Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA WebLogic Server,"I started working with this book hoping to get a good idea of how todeploy my applications with BEA. The product was very simple toinstall and deploy, but the server won't stay up when I startaccessing the site....The book was OK, but to much hype on theserver...."
5,I.M.O. Walter Scott...,"Considering how things ended up years later, it's just awful that the only song on this CD that got any attention to speak of back when these tracks were fairly new was ""The Cheater."" Don't get me wrong...that's an excellent track. But my very favorite tracks on this CD are the ones that were credited to Walter Scott as a solo artist. Okay, one other track really stands out...""You Better Run."" That is a superb example of what a very talented and emotive singer Walter Scott could be. I am sure he is greatly missed by his family, friends, and fans. Even I cherish every track on this CD, and I'm a fairly new fan of Bob Kuban & The In-Men.May God bless Walter Scott..."
5,SURPRISED!!!,I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THIS - THEY WERE BETTER THAN I REMEMBERED - OF COURSE IT HAS SOME LOW POINTS BUT OVERALL THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD.
3,"Okay, I guess","This book was overall, alright I suppose. I don't think it was the greatest TB Book ever written, but it was better than some of the other books I've read lately. Basically, Chris doesn't think she's a good enough jockey for Star after losing the Kentucky Derby in last place, and has too much to worry about, the prom, Melanie, [who's keeping Image at Townsend Acres], Parker, the Preakness, and tons of other things. So then she gets some advice from Affirmed's jockey, and then starts to believe that Star can pull something off. I wasn't too happy with the ending, and I'm still disappointed that Star hasn't won any of the Triple Crown races [I'm a huge Wonder's Star fan] and I'm getting annoyed with all these famous people, jockeys, and horses and all, but I guess I can only complain, not write the books."
4,okay,i enjoyed the book but then i do like chris and star but 1 thing that puzzled me - wasn't aaron and calm before the storm supposed to run in the preakness? i'm glad that parker and chris are starting to get closer together again but i think that they must hurry up and get back together.
2,not at all what i expected,"Well, by certainly they are using bribe's to get people to buy them, what's up with this Win a trip to a TB farm or win a free saddle?? Half of the loyal readers are over the age limit. But with the book, I mean come on, at least Legacy is found out again. But him only racing that one race because of Brad's Interferance? Come on, let's take a look back to Pride, what kind of stress did he ride under??? And Wonder too!! They can't tell me Brad didn't find a way to Race Legacy at all, that's pathetic and disheartening to him. And Wolf's bloated ego?? That seemed real enough at least, nothing like an apprentice ought to though. I'm sorry for any die hards out there that thought this was great, but I certainly didn't!"
1,Author Reviews,"Interestingly enough, the author of this book can be found slamming other books on their review page. Maybe thats a good thing, since judging by the reviews here, he may know what it takes to put out garbage."
1,Horrid,"Well, went to the practice test section and realized the very first question's answer was wrong. So I stopped reading the book and threw it in the garbage can. Pretty fail if the first question isn't even right.Unfortunately I have to give a minimum of one star. I'd give less if possible"
1,The easiest way to sabotage your test grade.,"I guarantee that using this book will lower your CS GRE score, between the misinformation and errors it contains and the time you'll waste that could be spent on more useful review tactics. I can only hope I stopped reading it soon enough.Interestingly enough, the author of the brief review section goes on a rant about what makes a bad practice test, in which he manages to describe many features of the practice test in the book itself. I wonder if he saw the questions that had been written by an outsourced team, felt a little remorse, and decided to give a bit of a warning to careful readers to atone for the fact that he'll profit from having his name on this piece of trash. Or maybe he never saw the test questions. Or maybe I'm giving him too much of the benefit of the doubt, and he's simply an astounding hypocrite who knows that you can sell anything as a test review book."
1,Horrible Book!,"I would've given this book a -1 if I could. One of the most poorly written books ever! The most useful part of this book was the ""Content Review Section"", where the book goes over all the major topics. But even then the author only skimmed over the topics -- not much content review!The practice exam, like the others have said, is absolutely horrible. Tons of mistakes; it had wrong solutions marked, or more than one correct choice. In short, do NOT buy this book!"
1,FULL OF MISINFORMATION,I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers. It would do the field of computer science education enormous good if all copies of this book were piled high and set ablaze in a giant bonfire.
2,Not true to size,"I own a pair of Softwalk clogs, MERCED size 7 1/2 W. They are the most comfortable pair of clogs I have ever owned. They were made in Brazil. I purchased Softwalk clogs, MADEIRA size 7 1/2 W and they are too small. I had to return them. They were made in China. Beware! Not all Softwalk clogs are sized the same. Very disappointed with Softwalk."
5,Really great series!,"I enjoyed this series. All three books were very well written...I couldn't wait to read the next one. Scripturally sound, I found myself re-examining how I interpreted certain passages in the bible. The whole series is excellent!"
5,"O'Malley Chronicles, Volume 1",I love Dee Henderson and all the books in the O'Malley Series. I love the Chronicles because it made it easy for me to read all the books. I would definitely recommend these three books to everyone.
3,Too slow,"I read the first two books in this volume for my book club. Some day, I might read the third book but I just couldn't do it now. I could not get in to these books. The writing is fine and the author is very knowledgable on many different subjects. And I liked the spiritual aspect and lack of vulgarity.However, I found the story too slow for this genre. The characters never seemed real to me and the dialouge doesn't ring true. I had to force myself to continue."
5,wireless keyboard,"Keyboard is good and found USB transmitter immediately. Just one issue with the seller, not with the keyboard: the seller advertised x-gene keyboard but sent me DSI. I used x-gene and was looking for x-gene. This is almost the same type keyboard from different producers but I received different product than I ordered."
2,"Practical, but poorly constructed","I bought two of these, one for each of two HTPCs. The first one died after roughly a month. The second one, which I've been using for about a year now, works, but here are the problems I've noticed with it:--The signal becomes shoddy more than just a few feet away from the TV, so I find myself constantly having to leave the couch to type.--The keys aren't very responsive, particularly the mouse buttons, and this has gotten worse over time.--The trackball sticks.On the whole, I'm disappointed."
2,"NICE KEYBOARD, WORTHLESS MOUSE","Unless you plan on using another mouse, or really really like a trackball mouse, do not buy this. The mouse tracks like an overexcited puppy. They could have a great keyboard if they put a small joystick mouse on it like the old SK-7100 keyboards had."
2,Not satisfied,"I had a need for an integrated keyboard & mouse with wireless so I tried this unit. I love the design. The keyboard has a great feel and is comfortable. It appears rugged and well built. After installing the (4) batteries (yikes) setup was a snap. Everything worked flawlessly, except for the trackball. This thing is nearly impossible to control precisely. It can take many tries before you finally land on the exact spot that you need to. There is no software control to adjust sensitivity. I thought I would get used to it but that didn't happen. I struggled using the trackball for over a week, then the keyboard went haywire. Certain groups of keys suddenly stopped working. In a way, I am kinda of glad this unit went bad because that will force me to replace it (with a different model). Otherwise, I may have just kept it and put up with hassle of operating the trackball."
1,Disappointed!,"Three reasons:1. The wireless signal goes dormant after 5 minutes so you then have to haggle with the USB key and the keyboard to get them to see each other again. This is a big deal breaker when you computer is inconveniently placed (the reason for the wireless in the first place).2. When it starts, the function keys are enabled by default, so you have remember to turn it off while typing or you get numbers mixed in,very annoying as the default feature, but more annoying that you cannot set it and forget it.3. Tech support is non-existent. Go to their site, send an email and you get some goofy feedback about how to send them another email to get them to respond...who does that? If you are wondering, I left a phone message too...got nothing!!Bottom line a waste of money...make sure you get to whomever is selling these like products and ask about these features BEFOREHAND as their marketing pitch sounded great, but their in the field delivery was very disappointing."
4,I like it,"I use this from the couch and it works good. I like the trackball connected to it and on the left side the scrolling dial is nice too. I had the usb laser connected in the back but had to bring it to the front for it to work better. The cursor does go into sleep mode, but I just click enter and it comes right back. I bought another one for backup and also one for a friend. You wouldn't want to try and speed type but the keys work fairly well. The batteries lasted me six months. There's not many wireless that have all these features on the keyboard. I don't like the touchpads so this one has been working out good so far."
2,"Lost sync with dongle frequently, stopped working completely after 18 months","I like this keyboard... when it works. I'm not a heavy user, and yet it would stop working every couple of months or so. By trial and error I figured out that to revive it, I needed to remove the batteries, wait a few seconds and put them back in, then re-sync. Then finally it seems to have completely failed just now, after about 18 months. I can't revive it anymore. I find it unacceptable for modern electronics to fail so quickly."
1,Change my reveiw,I have to change my review of this. After working great for a long time the two I have both started to fail. Some keys would not type. I could not type numbers. A real mess. They are trash now.
4,"Solid Construction, Good Range, Trackball...ehh so so.","The keyboard has a nice mass to it and the keys feel nice as well. The trackball and button placement is as natural as it could be. The scroll wheel on the right side is nice, but my wife would love it if she could perform the mouse functions with one hand instead of being forced to put it in her lap.The trackball roll action is a little grimy and not perfectly smooth. (As reported in a thousand other reviews I bought it knowing this).Overall, happy with what I received."
2,ok when it worked,it only worked when it wanted to. i think the receiver was the problem because the keyboard would hibernate fully when not in use. anyway. it was a great idea. i should have heeded the warnings here on this page.i sent it back for a refund.
4,mediaroom keyboard needs back lite keys to Ace review,"Only fault is a design issue, the keys need to be backlite to allow use in dark room. Layout and size is perfect for media room. I like the trackball and keyboard in one unit - nice layout and functionality of mouse buttons around frame of keyboard. Allows user to use keyboard without having to set it on a flat surface. Good price!"
2,wireless keyboard,"i bought this keybooard for the reason of being wireless. i am not at all satisfied with this product,it keeps turning off by itself and the owners manual does not give much help when i am having trouble."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this mini keyboard about two months ago. The wireless connection worked well. But, the keys began sticking. I got a continuous EEEEEEEEE one time. Then some of the keys didn't work. You have to touch the keys very hard and hope they work. I was using it for work and personal and this really became a problem. I wasted my money and would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"average functionality, does the job","I purchased this keyboard to control a media center pc hooked up to a tv -it works, no problems connecting and no problems using it. The button set up takes a bit of getting used to, as there is no right-click buttoon on the same side as the trackball, but the buttons on the opposite side are posititioned intutitively so that your other thumb will control them just fine. however, this is set up for right handers, so if you are left handed it is a little less intuitive. however, for normal use as a keyboard, this definitely cuts the cords."
2,"Bad dongle, had to return 2 weeks later for replacement","When it works, this is a great keyboard with the built in trackball, but the first one I received quit working after a couple weeks. Tried everything, would link up for a few seconds then loose the connection. Ended up contacting Adesso and they said the usb dongle was bad. Returned to Amazon for a replacment, so far so good (knock on wood)."
2,"Eats batteries, trackball has very jerky motion...not a quality product.","I bought one of these for use in my lab at work. Even though it is not used every day, the keyboard requires new batteries every 2 months or so. The ""spent"" batteries measure barely below the nominal voltage, i.e. they are usable in other gadgets. But for some reason the keyboard can't use them.I have never been happy with the trackball performance, since day one...it is jerky and very frustrating to use.I am looking for a replacement for this product."
4,good keyboard,"I use this to control a mini laptop connected to my larger tv. It was a little difficult getting the drivers installed on the mini - I wondered if there was a power issue. I had to re-install the drivers and then it worked fine! It's great now, can operate the computer from in bed and the trackball makes working without a desk very easy."
2,"Good concept, not so good execution","This keyboard is actually well designed conceptually. It's not too big and has many features. The trackball is quite good--it feels smooth, is relatively large and responds finely on screen. Also, the scroll wheel is a nice feature. Add to that a variety of hot keys and it seems this would be a winner. However, the feel of the keys is so annoying it is almost unusable. The keys feel mushy and almost sticky with no tactile ""click"" feel. It is not conducive to fast typing. Also, the mouse click buttons occasionally stick. Finally, the battery compartment is poorly located. The ""lock"" of the battery cover sticks out far too much and can easily snag your clothing or jeans if you use the keyboard on your lap. This usually results in the battery cover opening and the batteries falling out all over the place. I have used this keyboard for ~1 yr and I think I've had enough. Maybe the newer productions are improved, but my advice is to try it out at a store first."
1,Never Again,"The concept is SO GREAT. The follow through is MISERABLE. The ball is way to sensitive despite any configurations I've attempted in the software. It only works reliably from about 3 feet despite any claims made by the manufacturer. Having the left click and track ball so close together causes the use of one to effect the other. If you're trying to use it on a big screen you'll only be frustrated by the lack of precision necessary for the task. Unfortunately, this was made for use in the living room where it's pretty much useless."
4,very satisfied,the design is very good for use from you lap and access to the mouse and l/r click are very convenient. It does require a direct line of sight to p.c. and would be nice if it had R F feature. I would purchase another one for sure.
1,Second one same problem!,It seems as though this keyboard sometimes doesn't work unless you tilt it back. No idea why but its my second one. the scroll button broke on the first one after 2 years.
4,Perfect for HTPC,"Initially had the same issues mentioned above, about some keystrokes not registering. The USB receiver was connected at the back of the case, connecting it in the front, having a more direct line of sight fixed the problem. I am guessing less obstructions, less scattering of the wireless signal. Happy with the purchase, but not as small as I would have thought (should have looked at the dimensions)"
2,No Num Lock or Cap Lock Indicator,"I set-up my computer so that you have to log-on before using. I had to enter my password ten times before I could use it because I had no idea if the scroll lock, num lock or cap lock was on. How hard is it to have that on a keyboard?"
3,Optical not laser,"I bought this thinking it's a laser track mouse but instead they have upgraded or downgraded this to optital. I bought one about a year ago and it's laser because i can see the red laser between the track ball. I was disappointed to find out this was just a optical track ball, and as you know optital mouse sticks and is not very accurate. Don't know if this is a clone but it sure feel less responsive than the laser i have. No one can tell anymore what they are buying anymore so many clones. Nothing is ever the same it's insanity."
1,Stopped Working,"This is a good idea and I was excited about it, but I used it for about 3 days and it stopped working. I am using Vista Home Premium on a desktop.Overall, this thing is lame. I got a Microsoft wireless keyboard with a built in notebook-style mousepad that I am very happy with."
3,Works.,"I bought this for use with a Windows Media Center computer. It does the job.However, it is quite heavy and slippery!"
3,Great keyboard for HTPC,"The keyboard if great - light, small but not too much, with scroll wheel and mouse buttons on both right and left side. It feels very natural when using it. The problem is with sensitivity of the RF - it works 100% up to 1 meter, then starts loosing typed chars or mouse movements. At around 5m you need to point the keyboard directly to the RF receiver, which must be in clear visibility (forget placing it in the USB port at the back of the PC). I had to use USB extension cable to make the RF more reliable. The RF reset did not improve the sensitivity. Also, after some time with no activity (1-2 mins), the mouse cursor does not respond. You need to press any key and then the mouse cursor works again. Looks like if the keyboard goes into some sleep mode and mouse movement is not waking it up. Apart from this RF issue, the keyboard is excellent and would get 5*."
1,Shotty,"I bought this keyboard to used for surfing the internet from my couch. The basic idea of it is great, it has all the buttons I wanted (shortcut keys, scroll wheel, etc.). However, its painful to type with when it skips letters consistently no matter how fresh the batteries are. Also, moving the cursor with the scroll wheel is a struggle. If you are only looking to use it for a few minutes at a time its perfect but if you want to type an email or use it for an extended amount of time you'd be better off finding something else. I even tried to sell it to a friend for a discounted price but he returned it to me after experiencing the same difficulties. Great idea, poor product, spend some extra money and get one of higher quality."
1,"Nice layout, but not a good product","Loved the layout ease of use, but it locked up all the time giving usb error's. I'm now using an Iogear that works much better."
1,don`t buy this keyboard,I purchase this keyboard to use with my desktop pc hooked up to my hd tv. After 4 months the trackball stop responding and some keys would stop typing I would have to reconnect key board 3 times a minute. Now it`s been over a year nothing works. During that time period i called customer support over dozen time without any answers or solid response some time it would take a week for them to get back to me. The best answer i got was that i have too much interference. I bougth a isogear keyboard it works like magic never had these sort of problems for over 5 months while adesso had problems after 4 moths.The quality and durability is 1response 1customer service 1battery usage 5I would recommend from my experience to get a bit cheaper isogear rather then this there is a $30 price difference and quality is better...
4,Adesso wireless keyboard,"This keyboard works well at chairside in my orthodontic practice. It is compact and the trackball is convienient [no mouse]. I have 18 of them. Some are 2 years old; of them, about 4 have died. For their convienience and at the price, I consider them disposable. I keep some on hand should one go down. Battery life is OK, not great."
4,Perfect multimedia keyboard,"I have my computer tied in through my home entertainment system. A traditional keyboard is bulky paired with a wireless mouse makes things even more cumbersome. The Adesso brings it all together in an ergonomic package that fits nicely on your lap. The wireless range worked well. Unfortunately, I had to send the product back since the first 5 numbers on the keyboard were non-responsive and I could only use the num-lock which made it difficult to use. I am looking forward to getting my exchanged keyboard back in working order. The trackball works well but is not as smooth as my separate Logitech trackball and the ball can not be removed for cleaning which may be problematic for longevity. Otherwise, the product delivers on all points and provides great value. I would buy it again."
1,Great design but flawed execution.,"I've had this keyboard for a couple of years and at first it was a great addition to my home theatre setup. But the keyboard trackall has become progressively more difficult to control and you can't open the socket to clean or blow out whatever dust or other contaminant is interfering with it. I presume that's why it has become more and more difficult to control the cursor using the trackball. But whatever the reason, no amount of tweaking from the control panel has helped. The frustration is driving me crazy so I'll be dumping this and getting another brand. If anyone else is having this same problem, please post. Maybe mine is an anomaly. Otherwise this is the PERFECT keyboard for me."
2,"Reception stinks, but everything else is fine","On a fresh set of batteries, this keyboard is barely able to transmit a signal 2 meters, with clear line-of-sight to the antenna. It is pathetic; at this range, one in ten keystrokes just doesn't go through. It doesn't help that it uses the same 2.4 GHz band as the WiFi, so the keyboard stops working any time there's an active download, and the WiFi stops working any time you type.Physically and ergonomically, it's great. the sides make very good handles, and the trackball and mouse buttons are well-positioned. The built-in trackball is nice when it works (same reception problems, plus it doesn't track fast motion very well). Overall, however, the reception and interference problems make this a poor design."
3,Could be better,"The keyboard comes with very little documentation, so you're on your own. Installation is easy; just plug the USB receiver into your computer and install the batteries in the keyboard. Windows XP and Windows 7 automatically detected the keyboard so we don't need additional drivers.The trackball is cumbersome. It's a bit too sensitive and I needed to adjust the mouse controls in my Control Panel to tame it. The keyboard has mouse buttons on both sides and a roller built in to the left side. Handy. The keyboard is comfortable to handle and fits easily on my lap. Keys are responsive.The wireless portion is a bit buggy. There are times when the keyboard will stop responding all together. I needed to remove and install the batteries and the USB receiver to get the thing to start working again."
4,"Great for Windows, but avoid if you use Linux","I purchased this to work with my PS3 when running an alternate OS of Linux. The mouse does not work but the keyboard does inside of Linux. Gave up because of this and found out that it works great, keyboard & mouse in the PS3 web apps. I have also used it on my Windows systems and love it for its portability and small size to take with me everywhere."
1,"Not good enough, it's going back","This keyboard/trackball combo works well if you're sitting bolt upright at your desk with the USB receiver six inches away. But anywhere from 6 feet out in any position a couch potato might assume it starts dropping letters with annoying regularlity. This is not an HTPC lap keyboard so it's going back. Try typing a few passwords with this thing and you'll see how frustrating it is. Too bad, because it looks pretty rugged and has some nice touches, like a right mouse button next to he trackball as well as on the left side of the keyboard. Hoped I could avoid paying $100 plus for another Gyration air mouse and keyboard (having dropped and broken several) but in thi cas you apparently get what you pay or (I deliberately left that part uncorrected so you see what I mean)."
4,This keyboard is great... when it is working.,"The scroll and trigger functions are great. The ball mouse takes some getting used to.It has a weak signal though. Our computer is in a closet behind our TV, approx 15' from the couches. Started having issues with the keys after 3 months or so. Worked for approx 6 months (with heavy use). Replaced it with a different keyboard that has a great signal but scrolling is a pain (this one just stopped working also... after 6 months). Maybe they are all just cheaply built??"
4,wireless keyboard w/trackball,"Terrific keyboard for many apps. Compact and reasonably light. Cleverly designed w/left click on both the left and right sides of this keyboard. Scroll and trackball are real winners in this design too. This is my second one and I have gotten really good at gaming with it. But don't expect to do the same until you have it a while. The USB receiver limits your range if you have obstructions. With it in the back of your computer it may skip now and then and in the front it is susceptible to being bumped (nearly 3"" out from computer). Put in a well placed USB hub though and it might still work from the McDonald's drive-thru... I often use it across a large open room with no problems. Very handy and as the price drops even better for you."
4,"Installation a breeze on vista 32 bit, works great",Prompt delivery from Amazon - 2 day service! Installation a breeze on Vista 32 bit. Form factor combining mini-keyboard and trackball/ mouse just great. No problems working from 12+ feet. Had a miserable experience using HP wireless kb and mouse combo. How did I decide on Adesso wkb - 3000UB? Amazon reviews - thanks guys.One issue with kb. It is difficult to establish 'num' lock status. Hence 4 stars. 'Caps' status no issue.
4,It works well,"I could have spent triple the money to get something a bit better that looks prettier. I didn't. I'm glad I got what I did. it works quite well. I took the keyboard out of it's wrapper, put in some rechargeable batteries (I had), plugged it into my laptop, and began to use it. It took me a few minutes to get used to the trackball (I've been a mouse or touchpad sort til now). Now the trackball works as well as mouse or touchpad. I'm a happy person."
3,"A little intermittant - compact unit, easy to install","When this unit works, I love it. 90% of the time, it's fine, when it fails, I have to re sync by pressing the USB transmit device plugged into the PC and the ID key on the keyboard. I'm only 10' away from the PC. I use it in a HTPC (Home Theater PC) scenario. The built-in trackball works nicely and naturally with a right click trigger button on the right and right/left click buttons on the left. Keyboard sits nicely on my lap. Bottom line is, would I buy it again? Probably not. Jack in Ohio"
3,Nice - if you're sitting within 10',"I had just finished setting up my mediaPC and was ready to try out this wireless keyboard. Setup was a breeze (plug and play) and it worked great while standing next to the PC. Now my situation may be different since my mediaPC is tucked away in a closet next to the media room. So with that in mind, I can still use the keyboard in the media room within about 10' of the closet but anywhere beyond that distance and it becomes a paperweight. I may try getting a USB extension cable to move the RF unit closer. Also don't expect to be able to type 50+ words per minute on this thing. It's just not quick enough to keep up even if the signal quality is excellent. Therefore I give this a 3 out of 5 since it does it's job - just not well enough for my situation."
4,using as remove for tv,"works well when computer linked to tv. trackball requires a little pressure, but works well and lets me watch Netflix VOD from the sofa."
4,Wireless Keyboard,"All the buttons are very ergonomically placed. The keyboard sits nicely on the lap. The trackball is a little tough to get used to, but once you make good use of the scroll button, and realize you don't have to have a separate mouse lying around(which would need more batteries and a flat surface instead of your lap), you realize that this keyboard is a gem and a great idea.I've had it for a month now, and the batteries are still good. I'm using it with my laptop that is hooked up to my flat screen tv, so I can control my pc from the couch. The signal is best with a direct line of sight from the keyboard to the USB dongle. My distance is 10ft, and I haven't had any problems.**You must match the ID every time you use it as they instructions dictate, otherwise you will have connectivity/lag issues."
2,"Good at first, not so much later","About a year ago, I bought one of these to use with my PS3 and it was fine. I then stopped using the PS3 for most online stuff because it's nigh impossible to read web pages, etc, from across the room and the zoom function in the browser sucks. So I put this keyboard/trackball into storage until I got a computer for the living room.A couple weeks ago, I got a new computer and relegated my older one to the living room attached to my home theater. I retrieved this kb/mouse out of storage, plugged in the receiver and put new batteries in it.And it almost completely failed to work.The trackball would usually be able to move the cursor, but neither the mouse buttons nor scroll wheel worked, and the keyboard only worked intermittently.So far as I can tell, this thing has no longevity."
3,Things to consider before you buy!,"This wireless keyboard is 90% great and 10% horrible. I did read other reviews that warned of ""choppy"" connection with 2.4 Ghz RF transmitters and bought this anyway because it was cheaper than the blue-tooth models I was looking at. I now regret that decision and have all but stopped using the keyboard. I don't know what it is, but even when mousing it just ""skips"" around. I had hoped for better.On the plus side - the design of this keyboard is great. The design is ergonomic, the scroll wheel and mouse keys are in just the right places, and the shape is almost perfect for sitting on the couch and typing or surfing the web (I hooked my netbook to my TV - hence the need for this style of keyboard). If this exact same style of keyboard is available with a better connection type (I can't personally vouch for blue-tooth, but a friend told me it was better) then I would recommend trying that. I love the design and layout, just can't live with the RF."
3,"Has ""Issues""","I use this on a media center PC that I built. It's not the most comfortable keyboard, and the keys are kind of 'mushy' and difficult to press (not a big deal since I don't write a lot on my media center).The most annoying thing is that the wireless link keeps getting ""disconnected"" when I turn on the computer and I have to re-link it.For what it is (and considering it's about the only game in town if you want a wireless keyboard with a trackball), it works pretty good- when it works."
2,Medicore at best,"The device is cool, only if it worked properly. It is a constant pain in the ass when you type something and it does not register your commands on the computer. Example: If you do not type each key very slowly, some of your inputs will be skipped, i.e. (will not type correctly) If you type a word, only half of the text shows up. Then you are constantly going back and having to fix all the misspelled words. (Because the damn thing won't log all of your key strokes)."
2,"Great product, bad workmanship & design","We have gone through three of these keyboards for our home entertainment PC in less than a year, but we keep buying them because they are the most comfortable, practical option for HEPC we've found so far.The probelm is in the track ball. 1) It is not removable so you cannot clean lint or other fibers out of it, and 2) the supports that hold the trackball sensor into the keyboard housing break, leaving the ball slightly out of contact with the actuator.When I can find these for $30-40, I buy several and stock up. If they want more than $40, they will have to make a better product."
4,AWESOME KEYBOARD!!,"I got kicked out of my office because it became the ""baby room"". My monitor is now on a small end-table next to my recliner, with my computer next to it. I hated using my mouse on the armrest, it never worked right and it was annoying having cables all over me. So I ordered this keyboard and it is everything I had hoped it to be! Ergonomically, it is so natural and comfortable to use as both a keyboard and mouse. It has right, left, and scroll click. The only reason I give this a 4-star rating is because it doesn't read keystrokes at the speed that I type. Many times, I find myself going back while typing because it missed a character that I know I pressed. I have to type slower for the keyboard to transmit everything. Other than that, it works great as a replacement for a keyboard/mouse in both office and media purposes. Not so much for gaming, as you can't use the mouse and arrows at the same time very easily."
2,Unacceptably short battery life,"I have several wireless keyboards in addition to this one (a Logitech and an HP), and the others go six months to a year on a set of batteries. This Adesso lasts about a month at best. I also have wireless mice that last a year on a single set of batteries. OK, so this keyboard combines the functionality, but should that cut battery life so short?Also, even when the batteries have a full charge, the keyboard goes to sleep after a very short inactivity period. You can't just start typing; you have to click a cursor button to wake it up.I personally like the design, although the keys are not very sensitive. Unfortunately, the short battery life and even shorter inactivity timer make this keyboard unusable. Banished to the box of unloved electronics."
2,"Does the job for a living room computer, but chassis sucks","I've been using it for a year. This keyboards does the job for living room computer, but I would not use it for a primary computer. The keyboard will flex, and when it does it won't work. The flex gets worse over time. Typing while it's in your lap is out of the question. If you type quickly, it can also miss characters. This keyboard has the right features but is of low quality of design."
4,It's a keeper,"I am a game player and I own alot of games. I really like this game. It is a little like the movie, but still different in it's own way. I do incourage anyone to buy this game. Mostly if you love adventure games just as much as I do. Great game."
2,ATLANTIS: THE CRAPTACULAR CIVILIZATION 3 OUT OF 10,"This game feels somewhat like the Atlantis movie sequel Milo's Return, it's so God-awful you'll wanna take Milo out back, deep into a forested area, and shoot him dead this game sucks so bad. Your mission: to do worthless platforming challenges, to collect endless unrewarding items, to be utterly bored, and to do an endless assortment of other crappy, s***ty, terrible, who the hell knows why they're there, challenges. The voice acting is bad, the controls are bad, and just about everything else feels diseased by crappiness. The good: decent graphics and music. The bad: dear god, every other freaking thing!"
1,This Game is the worst yet of Disney.,"All of Disney's games like this are just ...(bad). All you do is go around and blast things. Its a bore. Dont even dare think about buying this game. Or The Emporers New Groove, so ...(bad). It in my estimate costs them almost nothing 2 produce this game i played it and its so ...(bad).If Disney read this review id say that Walt Disneys Crew should never make disney games agian. This game is worth only $2.00 out of your money. And this should be rated worst game ever made. Oh and the movie ...(was bad)."
5,Thoughtful and intriguing overview of mystery cults,"Walter Burkert is a reputable scholar and provides a great deal of information regarding early mystery cults. I found the information useful even when I disagreed with him about his conclusions; specifically he aims to lead readers away from the conclusion that Christianity had too much in common, or was based upon, early mystery cult traditions - although based on the text this would be an easy assumption to make.The main difference it seems is that Burkert treats these cults as dead religions with a certain amount of condescension, while not concealing his higher evaluation of Christianity. He claims that ""there is no evidence"" for the resurrection of Attis or Osiris (as opposed to the presumed evidence that Jesus actually rose from the dead) and that Persephone's followers are not resurrected (as opposed to Christians, who will be).Read the book yourselves, but focus on the information provided rather than the beliefs of the author."
2,Not What I Expected,"I've been researching and studying mythology and rites for years, and I was eager to buy this book. It was somewhat of a disappointment. It falls short in information, I found it too superficial. It does cling to one single view of the mystery cults, which also doesn't help - specially when you're versed in comparative mythology, or any comparative schools at all. Had I known it would be so poor on details, I wouldn't have bought it.(And the review is just as short as are the information on the book)"
5,"achingly brilliant, goofy genius","Written in a folk-music style, these songs are a challenge to classify beyond that. The comical wit they exhibit is almost painfully brilliant! Aspects of many of the songs' content suggest, at first blush, they might've been conceived for a young audience: Railroad Bill, Had a Good Day, How I Met Your Mother, the ""It"" song (<--the real title is something like ""The Cheese Stands Alone"")-- BUT they all deal with profound psychological & existential issues from adult experience (and most contain profanities that would take them out of the children's category). Around our house we discovered Andy's genius more than a decade ago, and this CD remains a popular gift we like to extend to friends BUT, writing now in 2002, I find this (and his other CD ""Proud Dad""), out of print, BOO HOO...!!!"
4,Fresh Brew,"The music Miles Davis made in the period this book grapples with was unpredictable, contentious, sometimes maddening, often exciting, and on occasion, the most thrilling thing on Earth. The book itself is a fit match for its subject. Faced with a body of work that's inspired more than one sensible critic to throw up his hands, Freeman just rolls up his sleeves and digs in, addressing the material with just the right balance of scepticism and enthusiasm. Those new to Miles Davis will get their eyes and ears opened wide; old-timers will be reminded what it's like to encounter some much-needed fresh thinking on an old favorite ."
2,Hmmm...,"I actually like Jando's playing slighly better than Schiff's. The difference is, Schiff manages to keep his mouth shut while he performs. Jando comes from the Glenn Gould school of ""humming along while playing,"" which results in an infuriating listening experience (and, forces me to subtract three stars). I bought this CD to hear what Bach has to say, not Jando. If you can tolerate the humming, you'll enjoy Jando's refreshing style and capable playing. Otherwise, stay away. Pipe down, Jeno! Your playing speaks for itself."
1,A tapesty of noise,"I can't believe that I actually spent my money on this ""music"" and time listening to it! I would have much rather spent the time listening to some Wendy Carlos that this poor excuse of Bach. J.S. would have been spinning in his grave if he would have heard his music being butchered! I think Jenö Jandó's work should have been called ""The Ill-Tempered Clavier""! That would have captured more of the essence of this disc."
1,Don't buy this,"They monitor your computer, even if you don't want them to. They deactivated my program because my first computer died and then I put it on a second computer. They said some crap about being only able to use it on one computer. Never buy this or nything else from this company."
5,Be Prepared,"This product works great but I must warn you that you will find things about your kids, teenagers for sure, that you did not expect. If you have the feeling that my child would never do that....check! My straight A 12 year old was watching porn while I would go to the store..would have NEVER guessed that. It has changed everything about how the internet is handled at my house!"
1,Spector Pro 6.0 is AN OLD VERSION. BUY THE LATEST VERSION ONLY!!!!,Specor Soft is an Excellent company but the Spector Pro Vs.6.0 Is OUT OF DATE.Not Supported any longer. Don't waste your money.Buy the latest product from the manufacturer for another $10.00 dollars and you will have support with a software that is capable of dealing with the latest websites your trying to monitor or prevent.
1,Shakedown,I had purchased a previous version of this product and I find it works fairly well. My issue is that the product uninstalls itself therefore defeating its own purpose because all of the data that is supposed to be monitored is lost. I called the manufacturer about this and their answer was that I hadn't purchased the subsequent updates. Well excuse me. I feel that since I purchased the product and additional licenses I should have the discretion of whether or not I choose to purchase updates. I therefore do not recommend this product due to the amount of important data I have lost and their failure to disclose this little detail.
1,"Why is this Company still Alive? Amazon, Shut them Down!","Question,I read all these complaints about the company and the software. Why does Amazon still let this company sell products through the Amazon Marketplace with so many angry customers? Also, the product KeyGrabber USB KeyLogger 8MB Black is a piece of junk and does not work. If and when it does work, it does not capture the data from the keyboard that you need. Many online banking sites somehow block this device from capturing anything. I checked with my bank, I was told because of the way the site is coded, the device will not work. Since IE9 does not save my username and password either, everything on the market for this industry is dead. With so much technology out, it is really amazing the United States has no more people / programmers / developers / computer engineers with any brains left."
1,Crap!,"Complete crap. I could never get it to record more than one side of facebook, chat or myspace activity. When I called for support they wanted me to pay an additional $30 on top of the $99 I spent for the program to make it work."
2,"Nice features, easy to use, but...","Antispyware detects Spector Pro and announces that the computer is being monitored. Kind of defeats the purpose of its ""stealth mode"""
2,Good Product But I Refuse to Pay Twice,I will not go into long drawn out detail. I was happy with Spector Pro. I purchased it for use on two home computers. It was great until it stopped working. I wanted to re download it from the email they sent when I purchased it. The download no longer works and the company wants me to buy it again. They will not send me the link for what I have already paid for.
1,Waste of money!,"After researching a number of monitoring programs I decided on Spector Pro because it advertised being able to record many programs including My Space which my son spends about 90% of his computer time on. So I shelled $[...] bucks and installed it on my son's computer. 3 months later it stopped recording My Space activity. I contacted their tech support and they assured me an update was on it's way. 6 months and a few more assurances later and still nothing. I recently called and spoke with their senior most tech person who told me there was nothing they could do because My Space made some programming changes that made the software stop recording. I'm sorry but for $[...] per program, they should be able to hire some competent programmers to update the software, not just shrug it off and say Oh Well."
1,Can only use on 1 computer in the house,Spector Pro wanted an additional $70 from me after I loaded Spector Pro on my daughter's miniDell using my serial # from the CD I purchased for $80 from Amazon. They shut down my whole program including the original on my desktop. So if you plan on using the CD you purchase to load on more than one computer in your house plan on them pulling the system right out from under you unless you fork out the extra cash.
3,Rolland,"The software works well, but I thought that it was remote monitoring software. I am going to have to buy some software that is remote monitoring, like Realtime Spy.Thank youJerry Rolland"
1,The worst!!,Tried 3 times to install - each time it completely shut down my internet access. No options to set the security that I wanted - totally NOT user friendly!
5,Great performance,"Great performance, great singing and great staging; you even get to accept a slightly overweight Rodolphe (but why didn't they make the DVDs dolby digital, too?"
2,"Some sexy shots, but no nudity","There's some see-thru and very suggestive clothes, but the nudity was edited out somewhere. Not a bad film. Good plot. If you're looking for the early skin flicks, this isn't really one of them."
5,Very good product,this game is good the only bad thing if you are not prepared for a spin muchi camera will give you a headache until you get used jajaj but the game is excellent
4,A great game from the likes of a great movie.,"I got this game a week before Christmas because I was getting a GameCube for Christmas. I played the game and found it incredible. The game is challenging, but never too hard. It's the kind of game you can play for hours on end, with loads of different moves, guns, and 'focus.' Focus allows you to slow down and do bullet time, also allowing you to defy gravity unlike you could before. YOu fight vampires, SWAT teams, and even Agents. Not to mention Amazon has it or a very low price. Enter the Matrix is worth every cent, and I'd recommend it to any Matrix fan, action fan, or any gamer who enjoys challenging fighting/action/shooting. There is also a hacking function which enables multiplayer. Multiplayer isn't the reason people buy the game, it's just an extra, so it's poorly made but still good fun."
4,A very good game,"ENter the Matrix is a third person actio adventure game that brings the genre to a whole new level. In the game you play as eithr Niobe or Ghost. You will spen most of your tim on foot, fighting SWAT and Police officers. This is more exciting than it sounds, as you will be able to run on walls, do spinning kicks, cartwheels, and much much more. You can also slow the game down using focus, which will essentially slow the game down to bullet time so you can see bullets coming at you and so you can do really cool moves. You will also have access to guns, as well as your fists. I took the one star off becasue the driving levels weren't too good, and the flying levels as Niobe would have been a lot better if you had a third person view. Buy this game anyway. Definatly worth your money"
1,This game sucks,"First off i'de like to say that the graphics on this game really suck.second, this game is the what ghost and niobe are doing in the movie so there is no plot. thirdly, its too easy, i beat it in two days playing for at leas an hour each day.All-in-all this game sucks and the Wachosky brother bragged about WAAAAAAAAAy too much. it is a waste of both youre time and money."
1,"Worst game, next to Spiderman","In terms of gameplay and controls alone, I give this game one star. Innumerable loading screens and tips that interrupt the action, confusing and often contradictory control layouts make it nearly impossible to pull off the moves you want... I'd like to go kung-fu on Shiny Entertainment, but even if they were unarmed, I think I'd lose with these controls. Add to this the horrifying graphics and lackluster, crackly audio, and you'll see why this game shames the name Matrix."
3,Lacks Awesomeness...,"The game has great graphics and the story runs parallel with that of the movie. However, the game play is lacking. The ""focus"" moves become very repetitive and the last couple of stages seem to be last minute additions so that the game could last an extra 30 minutes."
4,Enter the matriX,enter the matrix is by far the greatest game i have played in a long time. the graphics could be a little better but the gameplay makes up for it. the guns in the game are'nt any thing special but that doesnt matter because they're not supposed to be. the martial arts and off the wall stunts will capture you into the game. sometimes its fun to play easy levles just to so what trick you can pull. buy it and have fun.
4,"Pretty Cool, but slightly unpolished.","Enter the Matrix is a pretty fun game. The action is just plain cool. The actual gameplay of the game is okay but could have been a little more polished. The graphics are so-so. The real treat of this game are the in-game movies. This is one of the most expensive games ever made and the movies explain why. This game has its moments. There are some levels short levels that I just wanted to play over and over again, though that was rarely the case. The levels are repetitive and too long. But, as I said, this game does have its moments. (Words cannot describe the satisfaction felt after kicking Agent Smith off a skyscraper in the Vertigo level.)"
4,Atari makes a comeback!,"Atari is back with a five star game! I have yet to see the first matrix, so I don't know if the game is based on the movie yet. This game reminds me of Max Payne for PS2 and XBox because most of the moves are the same and you can enter bullet time at will! This game ain't for anyone who loves shooters because your most likely to do more hand to hand combat than shooting. And yes, the world famous move, the lean back to dodge the bullet is in there, too. And the agents are back and even harder than ever! If I had to choose between renting it or buying it, I would buy it without even thinking about renting it!"
2,An Okay Game....,"First of all the graphics in this game aren't all that great. I mean I know Gamecube doesn't have the best graphics but I didn't that graphics could look that bad for a contemporary game system! Also the game has lots of levels but is too easy. I mean I beat normal mode in two days! Anyway for the good things its sort of cool if you master all the focus moves for fighting enemies. Anyway the game's okay. I would recomend the Lord of the Rings Two Towers instead of this game. Oh well, if your a true matrix fan get it if not get another game."
4,Awesome game; other viewers complete idiots!,"This is really awesome, you couldn't take me away from it. Much better bullet time than I thought! Real gamers shouldn't care about graphics, they should just be considered the cherry on top, but they're still great! Sounds don't matter either, but they're great to have, especially when you break necks! But, to make this short and sweet, this game is great!!!!!"
4,Matrix,This game is really cool and I think it has awesome graphics andit really gives you the full affect of the matrix trilogy. TheKung Fu really is awesome and you get to do some really coolstunts like dodging bullets and walking on the walls. The drivingthe cars is fun! You get to choose to be Niobe or Ghost. If youare a matrix fan or you are looking for a good game then buyenter the matrix.
3,okay game,"The enter the matrix video takes you into the game. The focus feature let you dodge bullets, run up walls, and pull of amazing stunts. The only thing bad about this game is the graphics. The graphics sometimes look blury and you get stuck in walls. Also this game has a very low replay value. All in all this is an okay game. So i would rather rent it then buy it."
5,The Matrix has you.,"This game is awesome. When you start out, you can choose between two characters; Niobe and Ghost, each with their advantages and disadvantages. You can choose from 3 dificulty settings, easy, normal, or hard. I recommend you start on easy because normal is really hard for beginners. Overall this is a great game. It stays loyal to the Matrix trilogy and is really fun. the graphics are outstanding, and with some movie footage shot just for the movie, it is even better(plus it's written by the Whichowski brothers, the people who made the Matrix. You can do everything in this game, like run and fight agents, go into ""bullet-time"", and even enter some ""lobby shooting sprees"" like in the climax of the first Matrix movie. This game hardly ever gets repeditive. but if you get it, look foreward to some loss of sleep, cause it's all you'll be playing'! So order this, Neo needs your help."
5,One of the Best Video Games,"ENTER THE MATRIX is an awesome game where you get to defy gravity, watch flying bullets zoom through the air while you're in slow-motion, do awesome tricks, and kick butt with martial art moves. It's everything an action game could ask for. THe controls are easy to master and the levels are fun but sometimes short. A cool game."
5,I'M IN,"They only thing that I can say is: Zelda, move on over..the Matrix Has Me...One of the best designed games of all time, Enter the Matrix takes gamers through a ultimate journey. Any fan will do the deed of getting this game to play as Niobe or Ghost as the game ties into the movies and the Animatrix in the fight to save Zion. Not only do you get to play with the orginal cast, but you dodge bullets, drive through cities to find an exit, and most of all you run from Agents.Unlike many other games where you get lost or tired half way through, The Matrix has you in this GameCube classic.Plug in."
4,Really good !,"This game has a lot of elements that make it good but one of those elements spoils it a little. This game allows you to play as Niobe or Ghost (Two characters from The Matrix Reloaded.) It has really good fighting controls and whe you use the focus the characters perform out-of-this-world moves that made The Matrix franchise succesful and known. You get to use a vast collection of firearms and explosives and you eventually get a driving level. What I didn't like about this game is that you have certain levels in which you can't move, you have to shoot certain targets and that ruins part of the gameplay experience. This game also has a hidden multiplayer in which you can play as Morpheus, Agent Smith, Trinity and other characters from this game, I give it a 9 out of 10 because of the levels in which you can't move."
3,Could be better...,"When I first played this game I was blown away by the ability to slow down time, and the different ways to knock your enemies into submission. Then you beat the game... There is not much else to do. I started playing the game again and became bored. There are very little new things to do and soon the kung-fu moves and the bullet time gets boring. In the end, I am still glad I bought it. It provides something cool to do from time to time. And I hope someday they improve this game drastically."
4,"Very fun, and cool...","This game I think is the best game based on a movie. It allows you to litteraly ""enter the matrix."" A cool part about this game is that it allows you to slow down timeand preform really cool moves and tricks that can only be accessed then. Also, the code entering mode is very cool and brings to you that ""hacking"" sence, like you really are hacking in! I loved the dual wepons, and the cool matrix missions, and fact that both your health and your focus meter re-charge! But, somethings I disliked, the fact that on the road the cops are relentless and very powerful, the multiplayer (which you use a code to unlock) is very bad, the agents are very overpowering and if you see one, all you can hope is that you can escape somehow or he will continue to pick you up and throw you until your dead, other than those things, I say this game is very cool. And quite possibly the best game based on a movie."
2,Atari has truely outdone themselves,"What can I say, I didn't truely hate this game with every fiber of my being; just most of it. Granted, on easy, the game had a lot of potential. My friends and I would pass the wavebird around the room taking turns on every level, which turned out to be for the most part, about 5 or so minutes a piece. That is unless you play against Agent Smith, then he backs you into a corner and pounds you into the ground repeatedly. Boring. Don't even get me stated on the ladder animation. If you use the focus while climbing the ladder, it looks pretty good. I don't reccomend climbing without the focus, it's painful to see. Just like every other game, there are cheats, in this game ""hacks"" that unlocked a multi player section. I almost had a siezure. I being a button masher, won almost every round due to repeated slamming of the L,R,A, and the occasional B button. I didn't give it 1 star, because face it, it wasn't Brute Force."
4,Its ok,The game is a nice game comes with two discs one is the game disc the other is a behind the scenes disc from the movie. I liked playing the game but its not the type of game or theme that i enjoy playing. I got it because of the movie.
4,Good Game,"This is an awsome game, with tight bullet-time effects and a half-way decent replay value. I found it easy with Niobe, but Ghost's levels get harder. But the hardest part is...hacking. Yes, you can use a 'hacking program' to unlock character, weapon, and car bios, drop weapons into levels, activate cheat codes, unlock multiplayer battles (Like a cool Agent Smith Vs. Morphius one), and even get a sword for melee combat. But be careful, it can be frustrating. You just solve the puzzle of a lifetime, then trackers get to you and you lose all your hacking data. Great. Still, it's really fun."
3,"fun (but not original) idea, bad design",The only real difference I can see b/w this and Twister is that the mat has animals on it rather than circles and you use giant dice rather than a spinner to find out where to place a foot or hand. Therein lies my irritation. Once the giant dice are put together they no longer fit in the box & you can't take the dice back apart to store them. Very poor design for that reason.
1,What's the point?,I have the PC version with all the expansions and I have no idea why anyone would want to pay...for a console version which is usually worse than the PC version and which is more expensive...Pros: Awesome box artGraphics might be better than PC versionCons: More Expensive than PC versionHarder Controls than PC versionWon't come out with any expansions (unlike PC version)Bottom Line: I give the PC version 5 stars so just get the PC version!
4,The Sims is whats happening,The Sims for Gamecube is great game if you want to switch up from the PC play. The con of the game is that you are limited to how much furniture you can have (bogus) that takes away from my designing abilty and the goals are a bit difficult but the two player mode is pretty hot. I highly reccomend anybody to buy this game
4,Addictive,"I suppose addictive would be a complement, but I lost my life to this game for the days I rented it. I could not concentrate on my career or anything. After playing you also experience a depression from loss of time, and feel worthless. I would not recomend this game unless you have a lot of free time."
4,Great Game,The Sims is a really great game to play and very fun but before you buy it make sure you have a 251 block memory card because the game takes up 60 blocks. If you don't have the 251 memory card it might not be worth the extra $... but if you have the memory card I would definintly reccomend this game.
3,Should have been much better,Dont spend your money on this game. I bought it because it looked fun. It is a bad game. The gameplay itself seems to be the biggest flaw. The 'get a life' mode is boring because my sim refuses to look for a job. Why cant my sim talk to the people outside like the mailman? Maybe I dont get the game.
4,this game [is not good],the graphics may be good but who cares when you need an extra large memory cartrige it takes 60 blocks and a standard memory card is only 59 so if you want to save you cant and on top of that there arent any good codes for it unlike the pc version and the levels will drive you mad between them not wanting to do stuff which will complete the level they do stuff that has nothing to do with the level.so in short this game [is not good]
3,This isn't all that great,"First of all the graphics are real good and the items you can get are pretty cool. Yet still the game has problems. The gameplay is very difficult to get used to. It's VERY, VERY frustrating cause when you want your person to answer the phone or go to the bathroom all they do is stand there wetting their pants and making a fuss. If you throw a party the guests never do anything but talk so parties aren't as great as they seem. It sometimes makes me want to pull my hair out. The 2 player is the only thing realy fun about the game. Overall, I say dont buy it. Sometimes, I feel like I wasted $50 on a bad game. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ down the drain."
5,Cool Game,"This is game is so fun! It's kinda boring at the start because you have to live with your mom but after you beat that level, the next house is pretty fun and it also unlocks play the sims mode. Get a life mode is fun (that's where you start out with your mom) and it has two player games and stuff. The play the sims mode is way better because you get to have a whole neighborhood and get make houses and families. Here are some codes for this game!:get to the cheat code menu- press L and R buttons at the same time from here you just type the codesall objects are free- FREEALLunlock all two player games,locked items and skins- MIDASunlock first person view- FISH EYEunlock play the sims mode at all times- SIMSall thoses codes work too! this was a really great game you should buy it!"
3,Cant get far,"Well I do have to admit it is fun at first in Get A Life (single player story mode). But on the 3rd level it suddenly jumps to a horrendous pain in the back (can't say what I want to say here). You are somehow supposed to level your character's job level, throw a party (may I add it must be a good party), make a friend at the party and ask to move in with them, and keep watch on your stats. The stats are the biggest problem because your character needs you to tell him/her what to do and when to do it, so basically they will wet themselves if you dont tell them to take a bathroom brake. But also your stats screw with improving your job because he won't practice/workout/etc. if something is too low in his stats. Also it is very difficult to throw a good party whe you need to work, and keep watchin your stats (this word's startin to bug me). I hope this helps you make the right decision, but if you go your own way and beat level 3, tell me how lol."
4,Alot of memory,"I loved it when I first saw it but when i had to go to bed the game wouldn't save, thats when i noticed it needed sixty blocks. The game is awsome don't get me wrong though when it comes to all those memory needed you end up spending more money."
4,The Sims,"This is a great game. Getting jobs, having houses, and getting to know your neighbors is great fun! You get to have pets, go to parties, and design you own house. The creativity is infininte.I would recomend it for 13 and up because of sugestive themes."
2,Not the versions I remember,"I put this CD on my wish list before the preview tracks were available, so when I recieved it I was very dissapointed. The version of Cool Water and Tumbling Tumbleweeds are just not the ones I remember--they seem a little to ""speeded up"". In listening to some of the other preview tracks, I think I would have been happier with one of the older recordings when there were only 3 sons.The harmonies are still good, it just is not what I remember."
5,"DOWN TO EARTH, INTIMATE AND INFORMATIVE","I really enjoyed this book being relatively new to the world of the power of cyrstals. Other books I have read, layed out more like dictionaries, lacked the personal touch that Janeann is so generous with in her writing - sharing personal experiences and making sensible suggestions. This book has meant the most to me in my crystal reading thus far. It is beautiful, warm and full of information. I definitely vibrated with this one!"
1,Watch for this spare batteries,"I bought two equivalent batteries, as backups and they worked well... for a short while, after a few months of usage I could not get more than 20 pictures out of a battery even without using flash. What a waste of money, but mostly time and picturesThey don't hold the charge for a long time and don't last. My original canon 2 years old now still works flawlessly"
5,Great glasses,"These things are awesome. I work for Discount Tire Co and have to wear safety glasses all the time. However, I never do because every pair of safety glasses I've found are horribly uncomfortable.With these glasses, I forget they are on my face. They have the nose pieces to give some separation from the face to prevent fogging, the stay on your head. I have bough 5 pairs of these for guys I work with and for my brother who works for Ocean Spray. They are fantastic!"
2,Not as cool as they look,"These look great as safety glasses go, but my pair had loose lenses, the hinges squeak when opening and closing (smacks of cheapness) and they are far heavier than they look. I'll still be using the cheapo plastic glasses work provides come Monday morning."
3,Safety Glasses,They are great glasses but the lense does scratch very very easy. I use them when we are out riding in the mountains on our 4 wheelers and when I take them off I set them down on the dash and they were scratch. Other than that they are good.
4,good glasses for price,you can't find good safety glasses with metal frames like this very often. cheaper 'disposable' ones are often uncomfortable and scratch easily. better construction than most cheap sunglasses you find. the only problem i had was one of the nose pieces fell off the first day i wore them. i took them to a local eye glass shop and they hooked me up with new nose pieces free of charge. ifigured that was less hassel than returning them. aside from that they do the job they were supposed to.
4,Would buy another pair if I ever wear these out!,Heavy duty and comfortable not your typical plastic safety glasses! These should last awhile. You can hardly tell they are on.
5,THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION YOU WILL NOT REFUSE.,"AN ITALIAN CLASSIC SYNTHESIZED INTO A DANCE VERSION AND SUNG BY A FORMER MEMBER OF A ONCE FAMOUS ITALIAN BAND FORMERLY NAMED THE CALEPS FROM BENSONHURST, NEW YORK.YOU WON'T STOP DANCING . I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS CD SINGLE ."
2,Hard to keep clean,"I bought this toy because it was relatively inexpensive. I thought it would be a cute, fun toy for the bathtub. Little did I know, you cannot get any of the water out of the boat or the ark. I ended up throwing them away after they started growing mildew-gross. They would have probably been cute toys outside of the bathtub, but they were misleading because they said they were designed for the bathtub and I went ahead and put them in the water. You can get some of the water out of the animals, but I am a clean freak and I really don't like anything that runs the risk of getting my son sick. I would stick with a bath toy like the Mega Blocks Boat that doesn't have holes that you can pour water out of and wash them if you feel the need."
3,OK Bath Toy,"My 11 month old son doesn't seem too impressed with this as a bath toy. He likes the animals, but shows no interest in the ark--it's a little too big for Infant/Toddler bathtubs."
3,Ark tips over and animals fill up with water,"My 10-month-old daughter really enjoys this toy, even though the Ark has difficulty staying upright in the water. She carries the animals all over the house. The problem is that the animals fill up with bath water that doesn't come out until they are squeezed. Even then it's almost impossible to get it all out. So these cute little animals leak everywhere and that old bath water is likely growing things that I don't want in my baby's mouth."
3,Chewy Ark is too hard to put together,"I purchased the Chewy Ark for a friend's 1 year old son. It was very cute in the package but upon removing it from the plastic it became clear that it was difficult to take apart and almost impossible to put back together! It took all of my adult strength to get the ""house"" out of the boat and I never managed to get them back together. The animals needed to be pressed forcefully back into their molded shapes, a task too tough for a small child.But the animals were a big hit. Their squeaking sounds made all of the kids squeal with delight."
2,Sinking Ark,"My son got this for Christmas from his grandparents. It says on the packaging that it will float in water, but when we put it in my son's tub it immediately sunk. Not only does it sink but it fills up with water and it is impossible to get all the water out after bathtime so months later we are left with a mildewy, little-used toy. Save your money on this one."
3,Call it the Titanic!,"Because it will sink. Being stubborn, I ignored the reviews of this product and bought it. My little girl loved it, but the boat does have a hole in the bottom, which seems to be designed to suck in water and never let it out. The boat is now filled with water and will not float. What a rip!"
1,Mildew trap,This toy could have been quite fun if it had not grew mildew almost immediately. The block structures themselves were very hard which made it impossible to empty all of the water out of them after bathing. It should stay on dry land!
4,Fun while it lasted.,"This toy is really cute, and I thought it was perfect for our small son..whose name is Noah. However, when we put it in the bathtub, water got stuck in the animals and the ark itself and would not come out...we had to throw it out a few weeks later b/c it got mildewed. Also, it wouldn't float upright...it tipped sideways. Fun while it lasted."
4,Cute and Multifunctional,"I was really impressed with the sturdiness of this toy. I got it for our church nursery, since they were going with a Noah's ark theme. It is extremely easy to clean, and it can be used as individual toys and as a puzzle. Plus, since there are no sharp edges, you don't have to worry about injuries. The bright colors are really great, too."
3,Chewy Ark,"This is a great, colourful toy but perhaps the animals are a little stiff for a small child to remove and replace. However, once removed, they are great in the bath."
4,"CHEWY, CHEWY!","We rcvd this as a gift at our baby shower. We started giving this to my daughter at about 5 months. We had to take the animals out of the boat and give them to her that early, but she enjoyed chewing on them (teething). She is 10 months now & we still give this toy to her. She still has not figured out how to pull the animals out or put them back, but we are working on it."
5,Great!,"I've read all of Janette Oke's books and loved them all! I've also read the other books written by her and T. Davis Bunn. This is definitely the best collaberation of the two authors. The story took a little while to get moving, but once it did, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the sequel. Definitely a must read."
5,"Oke does it again, with Bunn's help!","I just finished this book and thoroughly enjoyed it! Oke and Bunn really made their characters ""live"" this time. Set in Acadia in the 1750's, the story revolves around the conflicts between the French and English. When a Frenchwoman and Englishwoman accidently meet in a meadow, they begin a tentative friendship which grows as they discover how much they have in common. As each one grows in her relationship with God, they become closer friends, and soon involve their families, which brings difficulties for all involved. The story was entertaining, of course, but also challenging; how is my relationship with God and with my friends? I'm already waiting (im)patiently for the sequel, due in early 2000!"
3,my review,"This is the story of two women who belong to two different cultures but yet have become very good friends, almost soul sisters. Fate deals them a very hard hand, and through love and faith, they are able to survive.I had never learned about the history of this region and about the Acadians. I was glad to be able to learn it through a historical novel!The characters are very real and are very well presented throughout the story. The plot also flows very well and the story remains interesting til the end.Once you read this book, you must continue with the sequel: ""The Sacred Shore""."
1,Boring,This was the most boring book I have ever read in my life. I couldn't get through it fast enough.
1,Typically tiring Oke,"All of Oke's heroine blush, shiver, quiver, quake, day dream, dream, and cry. They are ALL the same. Delicate, (though they do do the proverbial ""squaring of shoulders, lifting of chins in every book) stupid, golden heart do-gooders.There is very little REALNESS in her books. People just do not act that way.Secondly, OH GAWD the writing is tiresome. On and on and on about every minute detail repeat ... repeat ... just filling up space. I think Oke thinks all her readers are stupid and have to have it all s-p-e-l-l-e-d out.If this book was cut in half it may have been ok.Now I know why I had sworn off Oke about 15 years ago."
3,A nice historical book.,This book was ok i had a hard time getting into it but once i did i found it to be a sweet story. I liked the setting and how she used two people who were supposed to be enemies and showed that in spite of it all you can be kind to your enemies and even be best friends. The ending will definitely surprise you.It was a good book but i'm more into romance and it didn't really have any romance in it.
3,Slow to get into,"The Meeting Place had an interesting angle. The last 100 pages kept me going and I am VERY glad I pressed through to finish. However, it was extremely hard to get interested in for the first half of the book. The events were slow in taking place. This is made up for, though, from the ""baby switch"" to the end of the book. It got my interest up enough to want to read the sequel...but it took 150 pages before I could commit to that."
2,I was very disappointed at the historical inaccuracies,"I love Janette Oke's writing and have read almost all of her work. In The Meeting Place I was very distracted by the liberties taken with history. The Acadian people were of one faith - they were staunch Roman Catholics. They were not Huguenots. For me the historical inaccuracies coloured what would otherwise be a warm, sensitive story of two women caught in a political battle that was not their own. The story is wonderful, I just expect more in the way of acurate research for historical fiction."
2,Save your receipt -- you'll need it,"It works as advertized but mine died two years and three months after I bought it - and it has a two-year warranty. Tough, said the 800 number; buy another. Luckily my Platinum Mastercard doubles the manufacturer's warranty."
1,Not as beautiful as it looks.,The sides of the ring that do not have small round diamonds are flat (not shiny) and the image of the ring does not portray this.
3,Some good ideas,Book seems dated in its views and examples seem unrealistic. But the ideas are certainly worth considering.There is not a lot written about the art of conversation so this is a good place to start.
4,Indigo Dying,This was the first book I read by Susan Wittig and I found it very interesting. She kept on track and also taught me something about dyes. I always enjoy a cozy mystery and this one was very interesting.
3,"Good, but not her best","When China Bayles agrees to go to the small town of Indigo, Texas, to take part in the Colors to Dye For Workshop, she has no idea that not all of the dying will be in conjunction with the herbs she is supplying. The town is angry at Casey Ford, a crotchety old man who has decided to sell the mineral rights of his land to a strip mining operation which will virtually kill the town. When he is found dead, there are a number of suspects. The plot takes several twists and turns, as differentpeople's secret pasts are uncovered. Author Albert doesn't spend enough time on any of the characters to flesh them out so that the reader knows and cares about them. The emphasis on plot over characters makes this book less appealing to me than most of the other books in the series."
5,Another Good One!,"I enjoy reading Ms. Albert's fast-paced, well-written mysteries because I always learn something new and fascinating about herbs. In this China Bayles story we learn history and a bit of folklore on the art of fabric dying using natural plants and herbs. The plot was tight and kept me guessing up to the last chapter. If you love herbs and mysteries, then this is the series for you!"
4,Small Texas Town Murder Mystery!,"This book is quite different than most of the others in the series. Even the theme is different because the book is written around the whole concept of natuaral dyeing. Plants are still a part of the story, but in a different way. In this book China and Ruby set out to save a small Texas town from dying. The local landowner wants to sell the mining rites to the land, and it didn't seem to matter to him that the land had people's houses and businesses on it. Needless to say, he was not a popular citizen and when he turns up dead, no one in the small town of Indigo seems to mind a bit, but then other things start heating up and another body is found that seems totally unrelated to the first murder, and China and Ruby, along with China's McQuaid are on the tail of a murderer. Not a bad little story."
4,Okay Murder Mystery!,"This writer is new to me. I had just finished her most excellent books on the Beatrix Potter murders and jumped into this book. It's like switching from one pallet to another without a swish of water. My mind was expecting the same experience as the Potter books and it got another kind of reading experience - took a few pages to get into this book. It's a series of mysteries surrounding facts about herbs and plants - which I dearly love. It took a few chapters and then the book became interesting, although the receipes and herb facts are wonderful. I will read the rest of the series - and SO SHOULD EVERY OTHER READER. Good Book!"
2,It's like a party hat.,"Width is great. No problems for fellow pumpkin heads there. Two major problems. As another reviewer said, it needs more ""vertical depth"". It sits a full 2 inches above my ears. It's like wearing a party hat. The other problem, it has no padding. There are a couple of things that look like pads, but they are too thin. At that, they are not held on very well at all. Because of this lack of padding, the helmet is very uncomfortable. Because of that, I don't have mine on tight but rather loose. Not good for safety. It's OK for the time being while I search out another helmet, but that's it."
3,I would make a few changes,"My 44.5 inch head fits this helmet perfectly. The Sept08 version helmet is very light weight and I like the visor. Four improvements I would like to see. A much easier to open and close chin strap clip, softer straps, longer straps and more padding at the inside top of the helment."
5,Helmet for big heads,"This is a great bike helmet for those with large heads. I recommend it highly. Looks good, fits good, can be adjusted easily, low priced, and is very comfortable. I am pleased with it."
3,"OK, but.....","The New Orleans DVD was OK, but it wasn't quite what I expected. I was hoping for something more along the lines of a (pre-Katrina) pictorial tour-guide. It dealt more with the party atmosphere. The video quality was good."
4,Very Nice Shoes,"My shoes just arrived today. Unfortunately they are going back. To Big. I take a 10 in Kennith Cole, Skechers, and most brands. Ordered a size 10 in these and they are too big. At least a half size, maybe a full size to big. Long and wide. You may want to order down in size.........Other than the size issue. I thought the shoes were great. Very heavy, but that gave them the feel of a well made quality leather shoe. Leather and soles were well made and didn't have that cheap feel to them. I'll be getting another pair in a smaller size.I couldn't give them five stars because I didn't get a chance to wear them and see how well they'll hold up over time. Although they look like there should be no issues with them."
3,product is ok,"the shoes dont look as good as it look in the picture. specially leather is hard,it is not that soft.."
3,good but not perfect,"The shoe is comfortable and appears to be made with high quality leather. However there are couple of flaws. Shoe is heavy, leather is kind of hard and easily scratches (even brown color from out sole wore off around the heal after just one wear). Also little long."
4,Nice Shoes,"My husband says ""Good Leather, and stiching. Painful the first few days, but broke in quickly. Color on soles seems to wear off easily. All in all a great dael."""
5,Great Shoe,This is a great looking shoe at a terrific price. I have a high instep and the shoe fit perfect and is ever so comfortable. I have owned Bacco Bucci shoes in the past and they wear very well.
4,Great comfortable shoe,Im very pleased with this product since it is very comfortable and looks great in black. The only complaint was that the shoes where a little wide and a little pointy but overall good.
3,Good for a home made video,"The recipes in the video look really cool, but half the time they didn't turn out! He had to restart the fire several times since the coals weren't hot enough and the biscuit on a stick turned out doughy in the center.Also the video quality compared to a amateur YouTube how-to video. The camera operator said ""hmm"" a couple times, car horn honks, and people talking in the back ground.That aside, the recipes presented look great and I honestly can't wait to try some of these in my back yard, especially the cedar plank salmon and the beer bread in the dutch oven!Was it worth the $2 rental price? I got two good recipes from this video and I've paid MUCH more for cookbooks for only one recipe, so I'd say yes!"
5,Hogue Rubber Grips,"The feel of the gun is like night and day. If you shoot full magnum loads, you'll love these grips."
3,Complicated to install.,I thought this item would just screw on like it did with my S&W. Installing it on the Ruger it is a little more complicated. Its actually just sitting on my bench. Not worth the effort.
3,"it's okay, but it's not true 5.8GHz","I got the new version set (with color handset)it claims it runs at 5.8GHz, but actually handset to base is still running on 2.4GHz, only base to handset is running 5.8GHz, the reason I get 5.8GHz model is I run wireless LAN and bluetooth, the old 2.4GHz phone often kills the connectionthe mailbox is not that clear, and the setup is not that easy as well, and the mailbox can be monitored ONLY on base, not any handsetthe call voice is fine, speakerphone on handset is okay, not too loud, but the speakerphone on base is pretty loud if I set the volume to maxit has no hold function, you have to use mute insteadyou can use walkie-talkie between handsets, and transfer calls between base and handsetsthe battery is easily removable, and you can buy an extra battery for the base, that you can keep using the WHOLE system during power outage, this is very handy feature for un-interruptted useif you're running wireless LAN at home, think twice before buying this set"
2,Save the box and receipt,"I bought this telephone at Sam's and felt like this would be the end of all my phone worries. This telephone system worked great for one month, and then the reception went to the dogs. Unless I am within five feet of the answering device, I get only static on the handhelds. Unfortunately I didn't keep the receipt and box and cannot return it. I'm looking at going back to corded telephones."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this phone and kept it for 28 days. I was very un-happy with the quality of the phone and returned it for another brand. The main reason for this was the extremely poor quality of the answering machine. I would have to play the message 2 to 3 times to make sure I understood the person talking. The digital recording was very poor and slurred peoples words together. It also tended to cut messages off at the last second, so when someone ended a message by leaving their phone number, I would miss the last digit. Also, the phone quality was poor. If you speak at the same time as the other party, the volume for them would get very low....much like a half duplex system. I also had a good deal of static on the line. I am now trying out the Panasonic telephone and hope for better results."
5,Surebonder 9630,"I purchased this for assembling beekeeping hive woodenware, but have found so many other uses for it around my home and property that i ordered a second one just to have them readily at hand. I did have a plastic component break on the first one I purchased and even though it was out of warranty, Surebonder send me the replacement parts and instruction free of charge. You just don't get that kind of customer service any more and I really appreciate them doing that."
5,Great tool,Always wanted a 1/4 inch stapler. I do a lot of woodworking and wanted something that held better then a brad or finish nailer. This tool works great. Haven't had any misfires since i got it.
1,horrible,"I love how everyone has reviewed this game based on screenshots and video clips, and don't even own it.I have the PC version. Horrible. Graphics are slow on a high-end system, especially with a few enemies around. Mouse control is atrocious, feels like a console game controller - all over the place. Weapon accurracy is horrible unless in Focus Mode (SloMo). Scripting fight animations lock you in, preventing you from stopping or performing other moves (such as drawing weapons) until they're complete. Even the UI menus are severly broken, as using the mouse will result in double-clicking unintentionally. There's severe clipping problems everywhere (enemies guns stick through walls). A patch was released on May 16 but all it did was add a crosshair to 3rd person mode, and alter the startup screen without changing any functionality.This game has potential and with a MAJOR performance patch, could be great."
2,NOT worth it.,"Alright, the Matrix and Matrix II were great movies (okay, so I wouldn't go that far for MII...) but this game sucks. Sure, great kung-fu moves and all packed in, but if you actually look, you'll find glitches, glitches, and glitches. If you don't give about bugs in games, go ahead and buy it...but I warned you."
2,Like the Matrix? Like cr@ppy controls? Get ready for this!,"The girls (Jada and Bellucci) kiss. That is cool. Once you see that, just stop.Just to let you know how awful the controls are, on the XBOX version, the fire button is the little black peripheral button. No, not the trigger--that little one you use for your lights in HALO. God. The genius who configured this mess ought to have his shins slapped by baseball bats all day long. This whole game is about as responsive as a plastic sled on gravel.But the chicks do kiss. That is, and will always be, cool."
2,This should have been a DVD add-on,"OK, the extra footage and the tie-ins with the events in the movies is pretty cool (that's why there's two stars) but this wasn't designed to be an interactive game. It's rather a ""guess what you are expected to do exhausting marathon"".Simply put, you are expected to go through a level as if it were a movie scene, very scripted with no logical reason you should jump to a certain ledge or snipe from a certain position. YOU JUST DO and hope it might make some sense.It's probably a good game to watch while someone else who's got the levels figured out plays.But this is just a movie add-on that couldn't survive on its own."
4,Enter it and enter it well,"Enter the Matrix, in my opinion, is a quality game and is definitely worth purchasing. The game is a bit confusing, especially for those new to Xbox. The imbedded Matrix movie scenes alone are worth it. The action is great since bullet time and those famous Matrix ""moves"" are right at your fingertips. The graphics and game play are good, with only one exception. A few parts are just overly easy. It seems funny to complain about but it is true, for example when you are Ghost the whole last part with ""the Rabbit Hole"" is just point once, and shoot. Again this is extremely picky to complain about but that just shows the quality is that good. This is one of the better games for Xbox, of which there are still so few, so I definitely recommend it."
4,An AUTHENTIC Review From someone who has it!,"Here's the skinny, ya'll. This game IS awesome, there you have it. I own the PS2 version, and so far the game's graphics are continuously good, smooth, and only slows up if there are LOTS of guys (which doesn't happen TOO often). NO, you can't play as Trinity, Morpheus, Neo, and all the favs, but hey, if you could, the game would not be much fun (you wouldn't even have to DODGE). The story line and movies are pretty tight, and the story is dope. However, some textures do look a little funny, agents are VERY painful, and sometimes the sound becomes a little funky (they will say things twice in a row real fast). Anyway, overall, if your a Matrix junkie (the story is important to the movies), or you just wanna cool action/adventure title, PICK IT UP!!!"
2,Loved the Movie- Disapointed by the game !,"With all the hype around this game and the way they sold it as arevolution in gaming and interactive media - the Matrix DID NOT DELIVER!.There is nothing new or innovative.Game-Play:Similar to max Payne, with the bullet time feature however you don't really need much skill to play this - no chalange at all - the coolness of the martial arts moves ware off fast and the Driving Levels were absolutely boring !Graphics:-The Graphics are average and in some cases bad ""The Car models were really bad"" the cut-scenes however are the best I've ever seenMusic - Excellent sound track and voice over actingStory - How can you go wrong it is the Matrix !I don't think this game is worth [$$] - maybe a rental tosatisfy your curiosity- nothing more !"
3,Rent don't buy.,"This game has many failings. The graphics, even in the xbox version, are supremely sub-par. The game is marred with bland textures and crappy collision detection. The driving missions are atrocious. And the levels are often poorly designed. However, it is a great companion to the movie. The exclusive footage and the pure joy of slow-mo arse-whooping makes it worth the play through. I reccomend the rent because it took me a day to finish the game. The controls, as others have pointed out, are a bit unintuitive and very obviously created around the s-controller (which I don't use). The only reason I am able to give this game 3 stars instead of 2 or 1 is the tie-in to Reloaded. Having the game directed by the Wachowski's and the exclusive footage you get by playing through makes it worth the rent."
2,"Why, why, oh why have you crushed my dreams","The matrix. A great movie. A grand movie. Enter the Matrix? Find the exit quick. Fortunately, you can be told how bad this game is, you don't have to see it for yourself. This game is a dissapointment. The movie was so great, hype surounded the game, it came out, people were fooled.Bad graphics + glitches + bad control = bad game.If you have twenty bucks then simply buy a tom clancy game (splinter cell, ghost recon) or for ten bucks more get Halo. But please, please save your trouble and stay away from this game. Please don't be fooled. And if you don't believe me- rent it."
2,Great game if you like ninja and don't expect much,"This game is for ninja fans, which I am not, so I won't rate this game highly. But even ninja fans would not get too excited about this game.Pros: Not sure there are any, except a cool looking intro before the game starts. All down hill afterwards.Cons: Difficult gameplay, camera at a strange angle, and difficult to manipulate controls. Plot? Nothing else to say.Easy summary: forget this game."
2,Starts off good and then . . .,"it gets bad. Not just bad but monotonous. There is little variation in the game and as far as FPS and other shooters I have seen, this is a mess.Driving the cars is difficult. There are endless shootouts and running and running (did I mention running?) through long levels that just become so boring you could fall asleep. There is little variation in the levels, the lighting is bad and the sound is dismal.Sparks your ""operator"" is so whiney and can't act very well. Jada Pinket is hot and fun to play . . . the rest of it.There are glitches and the so called ""clues"" and ""fill-ins"" to the movie the Matrix Reloaded are so nominal (nothing you could have figured out yourself) that you don't really miss anything.I am surprised at the Warchoski Brothers. This game is so [crummy] and buggy and the story is so dull and disposable. You wont miss anything if you don't play this one. Not a thing."
3,Driving vehicles awesome?I think not!,"Now,I havent seen the movies,but I played the Pc version of this game and it took me 2 days to beat,First I beat it as ghost,tried the cheats out beat it in 2 days.Then,I played Niobe,without cheats,beat it in 2 days.Now,it might be short,but if you know this you can play over the levels(well I know that for pc not sure for xbox.The vehicle driving as Niobe was crapola.But using the focus on the guy that takes you prisoner when you are Niobe,it takes a lot less(I tried doing it without focus took me an hour.)But when in a vehicle as ghost,now thats a good way to get stress off from withdrawls from blowing something up."
3,slow motion is amazing,"5 stars for fun because seriously... snapping necks in slow motion wiht niobe will never get boring. This part of the game is so ridiculously awesome but the rest of the game drops it down to 3 stars. story line is very boring and levels get repetitive, also the character models are great but enviromental graphics lack the punch. I felt like I had to complete each level in less than 2 minutes the game was so hectic (which could also be a pro at times to some people). there really isnt anything special about this video game but staking vampire in slow mo is unbelievable so my advice to people is to rent this game and by the time its time to return it you will have had you fare share of breaking faces"
3,Don't buy it......Rent it,"Fun game, lots of FMV sequences that aren't in the movie, with lots of great back story....but the game play is pretty repetitive, and really easy to beat, I beat it with both characters in a total of 3 days. Fun, but not worth forty beans..."
2,Quite disapointed after all the fuzz,"Definitly should have waited a while before jumping from the excellent SplinterCell to this medium grade plain action game.From smooth controls and tactics to basic running around punching and kicking.Yes you guested it, I'm very disapointed. Ok, I must admit, I did not spend a lot of time getting used to the controls, but geez what's up with this shooting using the little black button!?!? Whatever the control mode, none of them are near standard or obvious. Don't we all hate that?Graphics are very basic in the sense that obviously no one lives in that ""world""... very unrealistic, plain and effort less. Forget the details, there are none!Oh, did I mention you have to choose between looking around or moving. you can't do both at the same time!!! Don't even dream of turning your head :(Anyway, I'll play a little more, give it an other hour or two to see if I can handle it.Definitly NOT a ""must have""..."
3,Pre-ramble...,"This game aint out yet, i aint played it yet and i have only seen small clips from it but everything in my body tells me that this is going to be a wicked game.I have no real idea of the content besides what has already been said here and the Offical Xbox Mag but it looks good.There are only 3 games im lookin forward to buying outright (no rental) this year and they are Fable, Halo 2 and this one. I have no doubt that this will be a first class game which MAY even revial the forever glowing Halo.I will write a review for this game when i play it. For now this is just a ramble to say i think it is worth the risk to just purchase this game outright without a rental. I hope we all won't be let down for doing so.... I Doubt We Will :)Enter The Matrix's ASAP!"
2,"Lotta sizzle, very little steak","What can I say? Compared to Splinter Cell, this game is really [weak]. Almost impossible to really aim the gun (just point and blast away), almost no control over the fancy stunts, the graphics are not that great, and the engine doesn't allow you to really play 'outside the box'. Splinter Cell seems to be able to handle anything you want to do, like elimintating the bad guys, then wandering around the set and exploring (and shooting) things that most never would look at.Compared to the hype, this game is rather [weak]."
2,Rent don't buy,"I rented the game instead of buying because I'm a poor college student. I beat it in four hours. I was expecting more of a challenge. The one aspect of the game that I liked were the featurettes featuring Niobi and Ghost. Don't belive the hype behind the game play the ""focus"" feature has been done before and will be done many times over in other better games. Don't buy it save your money for other games and what not. Warner brothers just wants your money."
2,"""Whoah!"" What stinks?","The Good:-Special Movie footage.-Gives you something to do while waiting for your clothes to dry.-Ummm, Niobi has a Camaro.The Bad:-What part of this game hasn't been done before?-I beat the game on hard in a couple of days!-The driving missions are horrible!-The hover-craft mission is beyond horrible!-The game was obviously rushed out the door to cash in on a franchise.The Ugly:-PS2 graphics! No where near Xbox standards.-Niobi's hair-doo."
4,Amazing Game,"I bought this game because a friend of mine said it was good. I had recently saw The Matrix Reloaded and thought it was cool. I didn't really follow it though. Plus, i didn't remember the original Matrix. I got it and started playing it. I was blown amay. Amazing graphics, great gameplay and fun! I recommend this game for someone who loves the whole Matrix storyline, or someone like me who thinks it is O.K."
1,Easy,"This game has great graphics, but the game is so easy because you can do 2 moves to win the whole game. The dodge one and the attack one. Don't buy this game"
4,someone deserves to be sacked,Started to play the game today and its worth playing. The level designs are pretty good and the FMV is worth watching but whoever designed the control system for the character movement should be sacked !
2,"Wake me when its over,that quick?","First to short,tops 1 to 2 hours(thats a badthing!).Alright,nextgraphics nice chacter models but enviorments are way to blad and glitchy(yet another flaw),but how could this catagory be complete without bad voice acting?,its terrible trust me.The weapons are the only reason this game is cool, the hand to hand sucks,and the driving missions are flat out retarted.take this from me dont buy this unless you have at least a 24 hour return(I say that because...its short)but it is fun for a short while."
3,Dissapointing but sort of OK-ish,"This game had the license to be great.I mean think,driving,fighting,shooting,hacking,and well its the Matrix.BUT they had to mess it up somehow like all movie games(except LOTR).Driving feels horrible when you dont even know where your going what your leaning out the window and shooting at absoloutely nothing,and for Ghost players NIOBE'S DRIVING IS HORRIBLE.The on foot levels are pretty good except for bugs and clipping issues.There are also frustrating times when you are at ""The cool part.""and the game instantly turns to a cinematic.Hacking is not as fun as i thought.But the Matrix moves are pretty cool.There is a button for slow-mo and you can do flips,run on walls,and dive.Kung-fu combos are cool too.Weapons have very limited ammo too.I do give them credit for making real MOVIE cinematics besides just the old cinematic graphics.This game is PRETTY fun.This one did not ful-fill the prophecy.But can the sequal be The One?"
3,PERFECT RENT,"This game is awesome at first then it gets old in 10 days. The graphics are average and people say that graphics doesn't make a good game, it does help if there good and all the glitches makes this game annoying."
2,Much better shooters out there,"Someone got me this as a birthday present - and I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it myself. If you REALLY REALLY like the Matrix, I'm sure you will enjoy the game, but it is pretty easy and the plot line is almost non-existant. Some of the slow motion moves are fun - but they get old after awhile.Bottom line... save your money for something better."
3,pretty fun,This game is very fun and addicting. You can use focus and run on walls and dive backwards shooting and dodge bullets. But it is simply too easy. Your health regenerates way too fast. I beat this game in probably 12 hours. I'm going to return the rental today. The driving level is very frustrating. Rent it but don't buy it. It's much too short.
4,MATRIX FANS WILL WET THEIR PANTS,"Seriously though if you like the Matrix movies than that is reason enough to buy this game. The hours of footage filmed solely for the game and the slo-mo action sequences are done well enough to excite the Matrix fan in everyone. For everyone else out there Enter the Matrix is still a good game in its own right. The story is good and the action is intense and exciting. True, some of the slow-mo moves do get pretty old after a while but it doesn't take away from the whole experience. Anyone who is looking for a fun shoot-em-up or is a a fan of Max Payne or to Rights should check this game out, even if you just rent it."
2,Well...it was fun the first time,"THe problem with this game is that, once beaten with both characters, you really lose interest in plaing it again. Most games at least peak a little interest after not playing them for a while. Not the case with this one. Enter the Matrix was nowhere as good as Max Payne. Too much hype for the game."
1,MATRIX GAME,"This game has bad graphics, poor gameplay and gives the matrix franchise a bad name(even though reloaded was a let down too)"
1,Sucks,"i am a big fan of the matrix trilogy and i would like to say that this game sucks i bought it beat it and returned it in less then a week. there is nothign worse then this game, dont buy it unless you want to just find out info. if your looking for a good game keep looking"
4,Enter A Pretty Cool Game,"What can I say about ""Enter the Matrix"", well first off if you loved the movie which everyone did, this game will not dissaponit you. The game is fun, the graphics aren't super awesome but they are pretty good. The fighting is way fun and smooth (it looks really awesome) and the gun fights kick... You have what called Focus time, it just like bullettime from Max Payne, but you can do a lot more with focus time than with bullet time, like dodge bullets and run up walls for example. When you play you can pick from two different charactors, and the game is different for each one. You can do everything from the Martix and more. Fight agents, run from agents, and kick cops... It like your playing a whole new matrix movie and I think it is worth a buy. GO SEE THE MATRIX RELODED!!!!"
3,What happened???,"Enter The Matrix is one kick butt game, including the hacking feature, but what i dont get is why you cant be neo, trinity, or morpheus, especially neo. Isnt the matrix main character neo? you dont see niobe or ghost running and going and fighting all those smiths. Neo should be in the game and you should be able to be him, thats why i gave this game only 3 stars."
2,"Terrible Game, but Good Movie Clips","The only reason to buy this game is to watch the exclusive movie clips. These can be accessed through the Hacking mode in the game (which is short but fun), so even playing the game is unnecessary.The controls are horrible: the entire right thumbstick is wasted, and the player has no control over camera rotation. The controller configuration cannot be customized, which leaves the player stuck with the default annoying configuration.It also becomes clear that this game was released before it was finished. In many places, enemy bullets pass through walls. The music is quite good, but sometimes sound effects come on randomly, and though the game supports High Definition in 1080i, the background and textures are generic. Movie clips are also not in HD.If you really must play this game, rent it."
1,Plastic is too hard to work with.,We bought these for our boat to secure the shore power cords on the dock. They are really difficult to use b/c it requires too much elbow grease to push the cord into the holder. I do not recommend product for others -- there are other solutions in the market.
4,ultimate-sports-gaming,"you can make(edit )your own team,grow it,earn money..and scout zidane(fabulous player).winning eleven supports hdd .some how it made me totally rethink about sports games.it's beyond fifa2003 ....way beyond...!"
3,"great gameplay, but diffiult","this game is actually in my opinion the best soccer game ever i have played so far. the master league is addictive and will keep you busy playing more and more----pronow what makes me give this game 3/5 well let see. the game is addictive but playing it will make your finger sweating. the Com A:I in this game is very challenging. imagine me playing in easy difficulty and it was very challenging and takes a longer time to score goal.i also find the commentary repetitive and not only that, winning a cup should give the player free time to celebrate with their cup but you won't find that in this game instead if you win a cup it will show your team picture with holding a cup.overall the game is good but annoying with the difficulty level. i will say buy the game if you don't care how difficulty it is! Hope this help"
2,Really bad game,"This game is really bad, even though the gameplay may be challenging, that the players have fake names is ugly. No real club teams, no real advertising, and bad sound. Even though fifa 2003 has not as good gameplay, it's a much more exiting game because you play with the real players, stadiums and the sound is magnificent."
2,Worse Game I ever play,"Even the motion of the players are better than ever in term of realistic, the game play is really really BAD. The graphic is also not too good.Player Controlling can not call playing game. It's too unpredictable in controlling, hard to control the move of players. They create some kind of buffer to stores the command so that it make a delaying response which make this game really up to the LUCK big time and can not count on the controller we holding anymore. However, A+ for motion of the players."
4,Easy to play - lots of fun,"I purchased this item for Christmas and got more than what I expected. My 6 year old son was able to play the game at the spot. It is very easy to play (some of our guests where playing the game immediately), very nice graphics, and all the family had a lot of fun together. What I did not like is that the national teams cannot be edited (some shirt designs do not match the actuals used in tournaments, neither the names of the players), however you can do so with clubs. Overall I give 5 star anyway."
5,It has got real club teams!,"Just to clarify things; Konami did not purchase the license so they took the best teams, modified the players' names slightly and created new team names. But yes, Manchaster, Real, Roma, etc. are all in. You can easily edit the names, jerseys, logos - go to gamefaqs.com and look under faq for a list of all the teams - I have played all sorts of soccer games for years and this beats everything, including Fifa- Gameplay Baby, gameplay!...You just have to be patient - this is a soccer sim - you can't just pick up your pads and expect to beat a high level. This must be the only game where formation, tactics, etc do matter."
3,CAUTION! No Licenced Teams and Players!,"As the biggest ""Fussball Fan"" I hate to do this but I must -----------------CAUTION! ------------ No Licenced Teams and Players! No Licence to play a UEFA Cup? No real Jerseys? Everything said about this game is true, lovely gameplay, graphics, but to me it's worthless without the REAL Teams & Players. Do you really want to play Moskinastaat against Fornatian?"
5,One of the best!!,"This was a great book!! It was mainly about Christina and Star getting ready for (and WINNING) the Belmont. But this book also talks about Chris and Mel renewing their friendship, Chris's future, Chris and Parker's relationship (I think they're getting back together and they should), and some drama at the track! I couldn't stop reading it and I finished it in 2 days! Great book, I can't wait for the next one!!"
1,"Poor quality control, would not fit my stock 94 Wrangler, returned","I returned this Hitch because I absolutely could not get it to fit my stock 94 Jeep Wrangler due to the fact that the mount arms were not in the proper position (to close together) I was really surprised and disappointed by the lack of quality control My Jeep is stock and I while I didn't mind having to drill the holes in the frame myself I was not expecting to have to bend the steel arms out in order to open up the space between them so that they would actually fit into place on the frame. A few years ago I might have gone ahead and bent them but not today. I returned this HITCH. I really do expect bette quality control from a well known company like Hidden Hitch. I was really disappointed, will not buy a Hidden Hitch again."
3,Good hitch...wrong picture,"The hitch pictured is not the hitch you get. I did like the short shipping time,and after talking to customer service to get the hitch pictured...was sent a replacement...again got the same one. Decided to keep it anyway. The hitch I got worked out fine...installed as advertized. Just wish someone would pay attention to what is pictured and what is shipped !"
2,disappointing,"The book seems to contain material edited out of other novels. The connection to the Christopher books is there, but tenuous. This is a ""Washington"" novel rather than a spy story, and there is not a single likeable character in it, which may help explain the moribund pace: perhaps the author's heart just wasn't in it."
4,a beautiful half of the story,"I completely agree with the other reviewers, saying it is a rather 'coffeetable' kind of book due to its lack of plans, sections and elevation, its minimal projecttexts and its emphasis on (beautiful) photos.Having said that I would like to add the following; being and architect I always want two things of my architecture books:1) getting all the background on both the architect and the projects, including projectdevelopment in both text and drawings2) getting the best pictures of the build workA lot of the time these things don't come in one good book so I have to buy two. For Louis Kahn this meant buying ""Louis I Kahn"" by Robert McCarter for a perfect overview of the life and ideas of Kahn and buying this book by Joseph Rykwert for its beautiful images. So for me this is one beautiful half of the whole story of Kahn, so buy it togehter with..."
2,A GOOD COFFEE TABLE BOOK,I agree with the review above. If you are an architect or anyone capable of understanding buildings through plans this book will leave you wanting something more. If you are just a casual observer of architecture and are satisfied with just the images then great. I have to say the images are great and it is really nice to hold the book in your hand and flip through the pages.
5,ARCHITECTURE MEETS PHOTOGRAPHY,"I believe the reviews complaining about the summary architectural documentation in this book are missing the point. This is not really an architecture book. It is clear to me, from the fine printing and lavish space given to images all the way to the handy trim size which makes this book delightful to hold, that the reason for revisiting Kahn one more time in this book was to take a new perspective on his work through photography. The flitting light that is captured on Kahn's monumental structures makes a striking combination of the ephemeral and graceful falling on solidity and stability. I really love it. I've never seen a book dedicated to one architect quite like it."
3,Millionare,"It is a good game,but it has a alot of repeat questions,but it is fun.Another bad thing is that when answer a question correctly,the illuminated answer becomes blue instead of green.But overall,a good game."
4,E-mail your Way to Higher Profits,"The E- prefix is hot. Every word preceded by the magic fifth letter of the alphabet seems to generate attention. E-promotions, of course is not any different. This publication builds on this eye catching phenomenon to describe the efficiency and legitimacy of e-mail marketing for targeted audiences in the publishing industry. Great book for college students and marketing profesionals."
2,This is an entry level book,This book is for people who are new to the online marketing. It contains many ideas that have been out there for years. I would say no more than 10% is new stuff.I would recommend it to people who are new to Internet marketing.
2,Thesis or Book?,"The book was disappointing. While there was some value to its content, the publication is more akin to a published university thesis than a book. Limited in scope to buying books online, wih reference to the Inter-American Development Bank's experience at using email to sell its publications, the title is misleading."
4,A wonderful Book on the History of this Great Lake,"I really enjoyed this book. It made me feel like I had something at stake, in this battle, despite the fact I was born many generations later. The book gives a (tales of the tape) reveiw of the two opposing Commanders. This book will fit right in with any history book on your shelf and will give you alot of insight into the Perry's wonderful victory."
2,THIS IS NOT THE UNCUT VERSION OF POLICE STORY 3: SUPERCOP,"Blah. That sums it up. After Dragon Dynasty did a FANTASTIC job with releasing uncut versions of Police Story parts I and II they did this to us... Yes folks, this is just the edited, American version of Supercop, re-released with different packaging. A huge disappointment!There are a few good things to say about this. Some of the bonus content is interesting. In fact there's a great interview with Jackie Chan where he complains about how the American versions of his movies are edited and not as good as the original versions! Ha! After suffering through the disappointment of watching the edited version of Supercop it was quite funny to watch that interview.The bottom line is boycott this. Pick up thePolice Story (Digitally Remastered Collector's Edition) Trilogy DVD Boxsetinstead so that you'll have the uncut version of Supercop as well as the first two films in the series."
4,My favorite Jackie Chan film,"Well, it's my favorite Chan film from the 90's. I wish this DVD had the original Hong Kong version as well as the US release with the stupid ""Everybody's Kung Fu Fighting"" song over the credits, but still it was money well spent."
1,Never thought I'd hate an OLP CD!,"But I do. This CD is horrible. I have bought every one of their cd's, gone to their live shows (3 times), and even liked the much hated Gravity CD. But this thing is just awful. Ive tried to like it, ive listened to it at least 10 times, and it just wont stick. The songs are boring, the hooks are lame, the guitars basic, its just the most plain jane olp cd ever. This may be my last OLP purchase. Oh well, spiritual machines still sounds good..."
4,In 1165 Days.....,This album was very very good and a lot better than gravity. i do like some songs on gravity yet i like all the songs on HIPT this is the type of album that i felt compelled to buy the Dual Disc version and i feel my money was well spent. they stated that they had written 47 songs in the 1165 days that had passed between gravity and HIPT so i am excited to see them live and hear new stuff or for them to release A new Album sometime soon
3,Love OLP but not their best work!,"Don't get me wrong I love OLP but I felt very politically drowned by several of the songs. I love Walking in Circles!!! I love the tune and its urgency. Where I don't feel the Typical OLP vibe is Wipe that smile off your face and The world on a String. (I don't agree with politics in music) SORRY! Other than those songs, I felt it was an Okay album. But they are losing my faith. They say they wrote 45 songs? They dang well better write a great new album really soon. If they wait as long as they did between the last two albums, they will slip into an unknown nothingness. They need A ""Happiness"" or at least a ""Spiritual machines"" album again to save them."
5,is our lady peace emo?,"i have a question before i buy this album....is our lady peace emo, because i dont really like emo bands such as my chemical romance or the used (dont ask me why i dont like emo, i just dont, bad vibes) anyways if this band isnt emo, i'll simply put this in my shopping cart and buy it"
2,Harmless Music,"If you enjoy safe, upbeat, slightly catchy, unadventurous, clean, structured, U2-ish, amusing, radio-friendly, alternative rock, then this is your ticket. Oh, how you'll love this one. It's even better than their previous album, Gravity (although that is no feat).On the other hand, move along if you like interesting music that strays from conventional song structures in the slightest."
3,Spiaitual machines 2???,"Im a hugh OLP fan and have been looking forward to this album for ages, on first listen of the album it was clear that OLP had gone back to the style of Spiaitual machines rahter then gravity(if you never heard it also soft metal) it was always going to be hard to try and make an album as gd as Spiaitual machines which was near pefect. so did OLP do it??? well on about 5 tracks yes but some of the track are quite poor i.e Apology and Al Genina(something ive never said about an olp album)i both were attemps to repete Are You Sad. there are however some great stand out tracks Angels/Losing/Sleep, Will the Future blame us? Low and Trust, Don't Stop and Boy. Is it worth getting only IF your a hugh fan!!"
2,Not much going on for me,"The great thing about music is that what doesn't appeal to one person sounds great to the next.You can see it here in the reviews for the new OLP cd as well as any other cd for sale at Amazon.I loved ""Gravity"".""Healthy"" is not horrible,but after a few listens nothing is memorable.I don't find myself singing any of the songs to myself during the day.Its just an ""Okay"" cd for me."
1,stinks,"say what you will about ""gravity"", but alteast it was listenable. this album is total crap. think coldplay meets keane meets long-view meets radiohead, and you have OLP. it seems now that ""gravity"" was OLP's one and only attempt to crossover into the mainstream, and with HIPT being released, it was probably their first and last as well. this is one of those bands that have a huge following and tons of faithful fans, but are totally lost on me, like the white stripes. not accessible in the least, AVOID!"
2,Like everyone else,This album is decent by the pop/rock standards of almost any other pop/rock band out there. The only problem is that it sounds like any other pop/rock band out there. The things that gave OLP a unique sound have been replaced with run of the mill devices that leave me wondering if I'm even listening to an OLP album. I have greatly respected these guys in the past for keeping their sound so fresh and alive over the course of multiple albums. I guess everyone runs out of gas sooner or later. This latest release is a dissapointment.
2,"Where Are You, Arnold Lanni?","Bob Rock is not the producer this band needs. Our Lady Peace is too unique of a band that on this album sounds a lot like U2. Ironically, one of the best examples of this is the song ""Boy."" It's a decent song, but the edge that OLP once had is apparently gone. Naveed and Clumsy are completely amazing from front to back, and I fear we will never hear another OLP album like that. Happiness and Spiritual Machines were both strong albums with some very edgy moments. All that happens with another sub-par album release is that I'll get to hear less of the superior older songs when I see them in October."
1,WARNING: this album will install a virus on your computer,"The cd will install this virus called a ""rootkit"" on your computer: [...]The copy-protection software on this album dangerously installs programs that run automatically and intentionally hide themselves.Just putting the cd in my computer unwittingly installed some software. It starts a service called ""XCP CD Proxy"" and caused my computer to hide folders and files starting with a dollar sign. It also installed and hid files in windows\system32\$sys$filesystem directory and automatically runs a file named $sys$DRMServer.exe, which sucks system resources even when the cd isn't playing AND THERE IS NO UNINSTALLER.For some excellent research on this rootkit, check out this page: http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.htmlOh, the music is alright, but low by Our Lady Peace standards. For a far superior album, try Spiritual Machines."
2,"Huge OLP fan, but this album is a huge disappointment","I have been a huge OLP fan for a very long time. I have loved all their previous albums and still listen to them frequently. I ran out to buy Healthy in Paranoid Times and have listened to it about 5 times all the way through hoping it would improve or grow on me with each listen. There are a few decent songs, but overall I would be perfectly ok (actually happier) if I had never bought this album. I had also planned to go see them in concert in October, but can't imagine having to suffer through a lot of these songs live. :( Overall, I'm super disappointed."
4,A quality CD!,"I just had the opportunity to listen to this cd... The first few songs are all right, but from track 5 (which is SWEET) on, it is a great cd"
2,gravity + Healthy in paranoid times prove Mike was the heart of this band,"I have been a fan since Naveed. i don't hate this album, i don't hate gravity. But together those 2 albums prove one thing, the heart and soul of OLP came and went when mike left the band. When i heard that he had left because of ""creative differences"" i desperatly hoped that he was not creative force behind the band. I gave them the benefit of the doubt with the disapointing Gravity. but this album proves that my inital fears were merited, Gone is the experimentation, the deep lyrics, everything that made this band different. I respect the people who are just now hearing Our Lady Peaces' music and are enjoying it, i really sincerely hope that you will all take a listen to Naveed, Happiness...and S.M."
3,OLP...PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR ROOTS...,"...Health in Paranoid Times is kinda boring...best song is Picture, which reminds me of the kind of sound they had on Happiness...I wish they'd return to that instead of continuing in this new direction"
2,Raine...Raine...Raine...,"This CD isn't terrible, instead it is a terrible waste of talent. Raine Maida has one of the best voices in modern rock. Unfortunately he forgot to bring it to the recording sessions. His vocals usually soar with the support of some clever guitar riffs. This disc is chock full of the riffs, but lacks the vocals. The only exception to this is ""Angels Losing Sleep"". This is an amazing track which opens the cd with a bang. After completing the disc, though, you find that the track is horribly misplaced and belongs on one of their better, previous discs. It is not like this disc is terrible (I mean I did give it two stars, not one), but rather I feel as though it is a waste of talent. Let's use this as a learning experience for next time boys."
3,Huge drop off in quality,"I've been a huge fan of Our Lady Peace since they've been... more mainstream with Clumsy. And I've always found a connection with their music. But Healthy In Paranoid Times, really let me down. The songs were not nearly as imaginative as before and I can't help but feel that, like so many other bands, they've become quite full of themselves and it shows in their music. But overall it is still a decent CD, but the magic may be gone. I'd love to be proven wrong."
2,Get back to Happiness,"I have to be honest- OLP is becoming really disappointing. After Spiritual Machines, things just started for the worst. Angels/Losing/Sleep is good, but one track isn't worth the cd."
2,I can't believe it,"Wow, what happened to OLP? I've loved them since I first heard Naveed. Their sound's changed over the years for sure, but they never stopped me from bobbing my head or tapping on my desk. When I get a new album, I try and focus more on actively listening to the songs. Even so, this album blended together into a shapeless mass. None of the songs stood out, or had a unique sound. No head-bobbing, or drums on my desktop.I really don't know what happened. I love OLP, but this album is just bland and boring."
2,"What Happen?! Come On, It could have been better!!!!","Our Lady Peace was one of my favorite bands growing up. Naveed was and is there best album that they made. Now that music has changed it seems now that Our lady Peace is falling in that hole of lameness. Normally when I listen to a new album by one of my favorite bands, I try to stay focus on all the songs. This album, I was about to fall a sleep. Very boring, all the topic in about every song was the same. I think at this point, Our Lady Peace might just have to hang it up and call it quits, or make another album like Naveed."
2,Progressively Worse...,"I'm probably one of the few OLP fans that been around since their debut Naveed. IMO, every release has gotten weaker with the exception of Spiritual Machines which marked a slight comeback IMO. Gravity and this new one might as well be another band all together. The only remaining evidence of OLP is Raines voice, which somehow manages to hold it together."
2,Shaky at best,"Recorded 43 tracks for the album, I believe it said in the CD insert.... then they must have picked the worst songs they recorded for this album. This album is almost like a collection of B-Sides. Weak, powerless, just going through the motions. Nothing even worth listening to on this album, besides 3 songs, none of which are vintage OLP.I bought this CD for $17 at Best Buy, and I said, ""This CD better be worth it for this insane price!"" Turns out, I got hosed."
1,Pathetic at best,"I don't even want to waste my time thinking about this album, but for the sake of others, I will. This album is an example of a band (or at least Raine) trying to hard. It seems like Raine took all he felt about the world, its events and state of affairs, and forced it all into songs. Nothing on this album seems like it naturally flowed from heart/mind to pen to paper. I love everything Our Lady Peace, they are my favorite band, until this record. I always told people there was not one Our Lady Peace song that I didn't enjoy. Sadly, these album leaves me with plenty. Maybe something better next time, I hope."
4,Return to Form,"Between the loss of a guitarist and the radio friendly album that was to follow (Gravity), I really didn't think OLP had it in them anymore. Especially considering Raine stating in interviews that they were ready to start doing a more song-oriented, mainstream sort of thing. And then there was the new single, ""Where Are You."" Not a good omen, but I got the new album anyway, and thankfully I was wrong. This is much better than Gravity, combining a little bit of that album's sound with more of their familiar songwriting from earlier records. It's not on level with Spiritual Machines, but I'd put it pretty close to Happiness. It definitely feels more like a cohesive album and less like a collection of singles, but the songs aren't quite as good as they used to be. Still though, it's better than 90% of the music on the radio these days."
1,Love(d?) OLP but not this album,"I LOVE Spiritual Machine and most of the album before. I was a bit disapointed by Gravity but liked it. But Healthy in Paranoid Times REALLY disapointed me. It's ok, not so bad, but not OLP, not the OLP I love... And worst than everything, I can't even put this album (that I've BOUGHT legally) on my IPOD because of all the protection they add to it... The only format I can use to put it on my computer is WMA which isn't the format require for my IPOD and by doing conversion I will loose a lot of quality. I understand that OLP what to protect its music and avoid illegal copy, but punishing the ones that actually buy music is not a good way to do it... And the booklet doesn't contain lyrics neither thanks...If you want this album, buy it from iTunes MusicStore, you won't win anything but trouble by buying the real CD (except if you buy the dual layer which comes with some extras)"
2,The worst OLP album ever!,"Ok maybe I just need to get used to it, but honestly, think of the worst OLP songs on any of their previous CDs and put them onto one album - what do you get? - Healthy in Paranoid Times. I disagree that it sounds like their early CDs. Naveed and Clumsy are their best albums, this does not rank with those two CDs.Despite that there are a couple songs which are gems on this album, namely : single ""Where are You"" and ""Will the Future Blame Us"".I would recommend listening to a good portion of this CD before deciding to buy it. Do not expect typical OLP."
4,Solid,A suprisingly good album. Everytime I buy their albums I know I am getting something special. From start to finish this album rocks.
2,OLP could be done.,"There was magic in their first 4 albums. The 5th album, Gravity, at least had some cool melodies. I hate to say it, but even though Raine apparently went to Iraq and saw some horrible things, he sure doesn't seem too passionate about it. There's a couple cool songs, but the rest are just sub-par to even good radio rock. And I hate radio rock. Their only chance is to get rid of Bob Rock and find their old guitar player. I could come up with these weak riffs,and I suck as a guitar player."
4,"Great music, terrible CD","Like everyone else says, HIPT is much better than Gravity, and meets up with the standard set with Spiritual Machines. Just be careful to note that Enhanced means the CD won't work with any Apple software or iPods, and you can't play the CD as an audio CD on a PC unless you use install extra software. Unfortuantely that software doesn't have key features, like an equalizer or the ability to rearrange the track order."
1,DRM = Dangerous Rootkit Malware,Sony should be ashamed for infecting PCs in which this CD is played.Amazon should stop selling this CD immediately given the known damage that is causes to computers.
5,Must Read for Web Wanderers!,"This little tome is exactly as promised. Imagine the hours (days? nights?) this crazy woman must have spent prowling the dregs of the World Wide Web in order to find these gems. I'll admit to not having counted them, but even if there are only 500 instead of 501, it's worth your time to flip through and find your heart's desire. (My favorite: Derek's Big Web Site of WalMart Purchase Receipts!) The only downside? The author didn't include an e-mail address where we can send her all the other favorites she missed (for the second edition which is sure to come). But, the publisher has listed their's. I guess that is where I'll start..."
5,Incredible set,This set will warm your heart and motivate your Christian walk with Christ. There is much here to learn of God's glorious character and the beauty of God's Word. I would recommend getting the cd-rom version of these volumes from richardsibbes.com. They are cheeper and searchable on your computer. But you wont be dissapointed in Sibbes.
4,50 Favorite Rooms Review,"This book is great either if you are wanting infornmation on Frank Lloyd Wright, his personal life or the works of art he created. It gives examples of his personal choices and styles. Each page includes a full page color picture of one of the rooms he designed.It also is a good book if you are just looking for examples of interior design or aritechture. It has unique pieces and will give you great ideas!"
3,leaves you wanting more,I think this book tries to do too much in too few pages. It really needs more space to capture that beauty of Frank Lloyd Wright's rooms. It is still a great book with very nice pictures but just not enough of it. I think you would be better off investing in a more substantial book that has the space to do this work justice. I think 50 rooms was too ambitious.
1,I did not receive this book I have sent Email and seller will not reply!,I paid good money for this book and did not receive it from seller I would not buy from them again! They will not respond to E-mail and I cannot find a phone number for them! I can not find a number for Amazon either on their web page! I hope that I might still receive the book! I just can't give a reveiw for a book I did not receive! I had to give it one star or I could not post this!
1,more sex and the single mom,"I have yet to recieve this item, but i beleive it is because it is just due to be realeased. So i cannot say if i am happy with it as i don't have the item yet"
5,A must see!,This film was amazing! It was funny and sweet and just a little bit twisted. I saw it at a screening in honor of Talk Like a Pirate Day 2007 and my sides hurt after it was over from laughing so much.
4,Rrrrrr!,"I bought this several months ago and finally watched it. It's a great little independent movie about guys trying to be pirates in this day and age, which is actually funny. Great purchase!"
2,Not worth the price,Low budget video that's attempting to hitch a ride on LDS video features reputations. Save your money for something better.
1,If you are looking for a pirate movie this ain't it!,"If you are looking for pirates in the genre of Flinn, or Depp, go elsewhere. This is an incredibly stupid film with poor plot and even poorer acting. Save your money!"
1,no treasure found here,"Don't waste your money on this one. I'm sending my copy to sleep with the fishes. Arrrg - big dissapointment,not much of a plot, bad acting and filming(scene transitions are bad). Not sure why it has so many positive reviews (makes me wonder if those involved in the movie have done any of those reviews - hmmmm?)"
1,I am so disappointed!,"I have to agree completely with SSmom. My family, we were all big Kirby fans, and I haven't been so disappointed in something or someone in a very long time. THIS IS NOT A FAMILY MOVIE, and although there are a few parts that are mildly funny, we all left it bored and saddened that our impressions of many of these actors were wrong. Turns out they fell for the Hollywood lure, and now they are just a few more Hollywood victims to us, jumbled up with all the rest of those who follow the crowd."
1,Not family friendly,"I am sorry to say I actually supported this movie thinking it was a ""family"" movie. I received a copy and was sorely dissapointed by the PG-13 rating. Kirby Heyborne (an actor who I usually enjoy) stars in this badly written, poorly acted movie about two grown men acting like pirates. Not only was the movie offensive (sexual inuendos, swearing and mild violence) to me and my family it was also extrodinarily boring. I am surprised to see Kirby Heyborne in a movie like this. Definitely look elsewhere for an entertaining movie, this one is a flop!"
4,Fun Film,We rented this dvd from our local library and my son absolutly loved it! We found it on Amazon - no surprise :) and ordered it.This vendor delivered it in a timely manner and my son has enjoyed showing it to his friends who don't know about the Great Salt Lake or that there were pirates that patrolled it shores...Appropriate viewing material for Ages 12 & up.
3,a Disney like animation of a classic poem,"The result reminded me very much of the movieHercules (Disney Gold Classic Collection).That comparison didn't give this result a favorable cast? Another modern movie abouthell isWhat Dreams May Comewhich I have to say is better done than eitherthis one or Hercules.We have in this movie the crusader hero Dante battling the 9 circles of hell to freehis beloved Beatrice. The sins of Dante weigh him down even as he battles the demons of hell.Dante is a poet of the Catholic church and sets down the doctrines of sinsthat damn one to these circles. The final battle with Lucifer, the fallen angel,shows the mythological form of the old poet who revives the imagery ofthe ancient world in Christian clothes.I suppose that the Robin Williams movie is not better in what it does?The merit of the film is that it presents classical material in a waythat many would not get by reading a bad modern translation of the classical Italianpoetry."
4,I wish I had this in European Literature!,Dante's Inferno is a fun? product that brought the famous text alive for me. I look forward to watching similiar presentations of Beowulf and some of the national myths!!
3,Old-school just doesn't cut it any more,"Old-school animation just doesn't stack up against the modern computer-generated works of art. It's spectacular, but not a must-buy."
3,"A decent anime, but a little loose on the book!","I like how we finally get a visual interpretation on the story! But it could be better!What I liked about it:1. The all the animation styles were great!2. There was a lot of action!3. The characters all served a good purpose!4. Each of the sections of hell were very detailed!What I didn't like was:1. They could have been a little more true to the book!2. The movie was more true to the video game than the book!3. Most of the main characters had too much whinny dialogue!Overall; anime fans will probably like this movie!Fans of 'The Devine Comedy' might snicker at it!But I thought it was a good movie, for the most part!My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!"
2,Abandon All Hope All Ye Who Purchase This,"The production value of this animated feature is rather low. The graphic style changes no less than 5 times in the film with 5 entirely different depictions of Dante, Virgil, Beatrice, Lucifer and even hell itself. Oddly enough, it starts off with characters that bear a pretty close resemblance to their counterparts in the video game, but dwindles off from there. It's almost as if they locked 5 artists up in 5 different rooms and gave them parts of the movie to draw with no central guidance or communication between them. This movie is a complete pass: clearly just an attempt to rack up more dough off the franchise. Save your money.By the way, Mark Hamill, just because your Joker voice works for the Joker, that doesn't mean you can just use the same voice for every character you voice. Sheesh, it was almost jarring seeing Dante's father but hearing the Joker from Batman."
1,Disappointing production,"This movie was most disappointing. After playing the game on PS3, I was actually excited to see what a movie based on this epic could be like. First of all, it's short, about 88 minutes. I did not find that the movie reflected enough of what we see in the game or enough that you can read about if you decide to tackle the actuel epic poem written by Dante. A lot has been left out. The transitions betweeen the levels of Hell are marked by titles. The animation is ok at best, not the kind of quality you'd expect from a good japanimation. For some reason, Dante changes appearance without explanation trhough the movie, his past is relived in flashbacks, which is aobut the only thing that corresponds to the depiction of his memories in the game. Personnally, I'd say, if you want to know Dante, read the classic. If you're a gamer, play the video game instead, you'll still learn more about that great story. I couldn't bear to watch more than 40 minutes of it before I got sick of it."
1,Knights Templar Muscleman Big Happy Kill Fun,"This was so horribly bad I couldn't believe it. Dante must be spinning in his grave to see what someone has the gall to call an adaptation of his work. There are other adaptations that are great: The Inferno by Dermot Mulroney was clever; The Inferno by Tangerine Dream is beautiful and haunting. This version, on the other hand, is just pure crap. Lots of blood and guts, though; it might even have been good if they hadn't tried to frame it as ""Dante's Inferno"", but had just called it something like ""Knights Templar Muscleman big happy kill fun""."
4,good details,I enjoyed the way the story was told and the graphics were great. Hope the story goes on for love is an ongoing event.
4,Dante,I liked the movie. I thought the anime was decent. only thing I found a bit confusing is Dante's appearance changes as He progress into Hell. Other then that I thought I was well done. Wasnt crazy about the delivery time. was a week late getting to me. It sat for 4 days in Wa. got My other order faster and I ordered it at the same time with got the same delivery date and it got to me earlier. Go figure. But all in all it was a good flic
3,"Gory, Grotesque, Good, but NOT Great","Reasons to watch:+ Awesome animation - from all the artists+ Interesting storyline+ Cool if you have surround soundWhat will make you wince:- Done by SIX directors/artists all with completely different styles.- Difficult to distinguish characters after a director change- Timing sucks- It's not really Dante's Inferno, just based on the characters or story or something...You Might like:= Lots of gross, gory violence= nudity= unappealing language= not for children"
2,Dante for the anime' crowd,"While it's been many years since I read Dante's Inferno it's one of those books that leaves you with some fairly strong lasting impressions. I thought that an animated video version had the possibility of being even more chilling but was sadly disappointed. It was more like a comic book than one of the most horrific novels of all time and I found it to be poorly done and not worth the time. Sad, because the medium had to potential to render the classic tale with new levels of horror and suspense."
2,Not my bag,This movie just didn't jive with me. I've tried to watch it a few times but it's been unable to hold my attention. The animation is done well but the overall story was a little off.
2,"Not Your Father's ""Dante's Inferno""","Dante's Inferno is classic literature. Tying to make a movie out of it--much less a feature length cartoon has to be challenging. And, unfortunately, try as they might, the makers of this animated feature weren't able to quite pull this off.This is an animated feature that is absolutely not aimed at kids. You probably want to screen and edit the movie before you allow young children to watch it. Partially nutidity, graphic violence and some rather disturbing images (even for adults) are used frequently throughout the film. This wouldn't be so bad if the content, the acting and the animation held their own. Sadly they do not. Instead of being creative with the treatment the producers and director went the safe, predictable route.It's hard to recommend this film to the average viewer. However, I don't doubt that there will be those enjoy the film and, who knows, it could always develop a cult following."
1,Miserable low-brow drivel.,"This isn't exactly a movie. It's more like the back-story to a video game. It's a pretty pathetic offering, considering the vivid poetry on which it is based. Dante's work was a cultural peak, this wretched movie is a cultural low.And yet, there are people for whom this movie is the perfect choice. What kind of person would that be? Someone who doesn't really care about 700-year-old Italian poetry. Someone who is satisfied with animation involving drab colors and characters who don't move, blink or change facial expressions. Someone for whom plot holes don't matter. Someone who likes swords and blood. In other words, a 12-year-old boy pumped up on testosterone.If you are such a person, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you have even a tiny quantity of discerning taste, skip this one."
2,Not Kylie's Best Work!,This album is not one of Kylie's best albums she's every done.If maybe she would had taken some more time on this in stead of in a hurry to get another album out. Then maybe it would sound better.The best songs on there are:Loving DaysSweet MusicI Feel For YouChocolateThose are the best songs on there.
5,"I have the Vhs Version, One of my Favorite Corvette Videos.","This is one of my Favorite Corvette Videos, I have the Vhs Version, it has a beautiful cover as shown, there is interviews with both daves(Corvette Engineers) No Zora talking, only seen with the other engineers. GrandSport Roadster (Raced as #10) is Started up and seen at a Car show back in 1993, in Boston and you see a Car show at The Franklin Mint. Very Good Coverage."
5,Excellent reference - use it often!,"My thanks to the author for an excellent reference . While it's not a tutorial, it still manages to give short but clear summaries on various aspects of the language. Nice examples too. Wouldn't want to be without it or the Core Java books by Horstmann & Cornell."
4,Love Melissa and Doug products,"This was the first Melissa and Doug product I got for my then 2 year old. The puzzles were easy for him to work with, the pieces were big enough and fun to put together."
5,My daughter loves it.,"This is my daughter's first puzzle and learned to do puzzles with it. The colors are very bright and attractive. The pieces are large and easy for the little hands to handle. The designs range from really easy (the color theme) and more challenging (the alphabet theme). A great puzzle all in all.I don't have problem with the fact that all pieces are mixed in one box. The pieces are stamped on the back with shapes representing each design. It has been a great way to teach my daughter to sort based on the stamps. And once she has the pieces for a particular design picked out, we enjoy counting them to make sure all 12 pieces are there."
3,Good Read,First Leonard cowboy I have read: as always he writes well. I will without doubt read more in the future
4,Read but don't watch!,"Loved this book. It is just a breeze to read and the epitome of a page turner. Just a great story really that's full of everything you'd want from a classic old west tale. I'd recommend whole heartedly and don't bother watching the film, which they made a mess of!"
3,"Elmore Leonard's ""Valdez Is Coming.""","I read Leonard's ""Gunsight's"", & I didn't really care for it, but I tried this book anyway. It was better than ""Gunsights"", but I still believe that William W. Johnstone's books are a better read. My advice to any western novel fan is try it anyway, --don't miss out because of someone elses opinion."
5,Fantastic! it was enlightening and entertaining,This book kept me spellbound. The author has a wonderful talent for exploring and explaining a subject normally done in boring textbook verse. It is written for Christians from a Biblical perspective and is laced through characters which leave you asking for more.
3,Just ok,I replaced all of my can light trims in an older home. This was the only option that I had for the fireplace light. Looks ok but still a little dated. I will keep looking for another option.
3,Probably is correct material,"Actually, the previous reviewer is thinking of Tamper-Resistant Torx Plus, which has five lobes and a pin in the center to prevent unauthorized tools from removing the screw. Those bits cannot be sold by Amazon because the company that designed them strictly controls their sale only to authorized repair shops doing work on machinery that uses Tamper-Resistant Torx Plus fasteners. Regular Torx Plus does have six lobes, but they are a little ""fatter"" than the lobes in regular Torx. You can use regular Torx tools to remove most Torx Plus fasteners, but you won't get the same torque performance as you would by using actual Torx Plus tools."
2,Christmas with Jack Benny,The DVD had two shows. The first show was very funny. The second show was a New Year's program and it wasn't very funny.
2,Durability Optional,"I bought two pairs of these about a year ago (one for home, one for work), and since then both of them have broken.The first one had a wire break internally so that half the time only one headphone worked. Later, the joint connecting to the bridge snapped off near the working headphone.The second one now has a broken wire, but _INSIDE_ the bridge (how does that make sense?). I still have the bridge component to the other one, so hopefully swapping it will give me one working pair of headphones and one very broken pair.Other than the durability issues, this is a great headset. For $80, though, I expect things to last longer than a year. I give 2/5 stars because things that are broken dont even get a chance to be reviewed in the other areas."
3,They're okay,"The sound out is nice but the mechanism to make adjustments on my head kind of suck. I have had to use sneaker laces on each ear cup to keep the cup from sliding down below my ears. I've had these for over a year now so I've been using them for recording audio, gaming and what not. I wouldn't buy these again."
1,Awesome headset which you can't rely on,"Ok this headset is the bomb whether you're playing music or games. The mic quality is perfect too - I can record crystal clear sounds.So where exactly is the hang up? The durability is worse than a 10 dollar headset. Like one of the reviews I read, I bought two headsets too and both of them are not working now. Why? because of the wire, somehow it manages to break internally and at first you'll lose the sound from one side and sooner or later both."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL!,"Now don't get me wrong. This is a VERY good headset to buy. The sto-ability of the flexible mic was very useful. Sound quality was very good through the mic, as well as the headsets. The headsets were very comfartable during VERY long, daily hours of gameplay (4-12hrs at some points in time). The only thing that you have to be VERY careful of, is wire kinking. As you'll see in the other negative reviews, the wire kinks very easily and this then causes breaks to happen. Ultimately this leads to the failure of the head set. So BE VERY CAREFUL with the wires."
4,Good Stuff,"Seems sturdy. The mic quality is much improved from my previous mic. The sound quality is good. I've had an issue or 2 with the mic switch, but I don't mess with it and it's fine. Comfortable. Can't say that I have any real complaints yet."
3,Good Sound but Poor Fit for Larger Heads,"When I first used the 5H headset I was impressed at the quality of both the high and low range sounds in the video games I used it for, however it gave me a splitting headache after only 10-20 minutes of use. I tried using them several more times but got similar results. I gave up and sent them back and plan to try a different brand. Be warned if you don't have a small head these will grip your head like a vise and may cause headache."
4,Good overall,"Well, I have been gaming for 5 years and have gone threw multiple headsets that go out or break. compared to my previous headset the Sennheiser pc 150,I would take the Stealsound headset any day.Pros: Comfterable to wear for long periods of time.Cords are nice and long/strongClear sound,Retractable mic is nice.Cons: The ear pieces seem to be coming unstuck only after a month of use. but its fixable."
1,Dont Buy,"As with others, they work great when you first get them, but then one earphone goes dead to broken wire.Although I like them, they are or wee 80 dollars of junk. I seen 5 dollar headsets preform better"
2,Meh,"While they are very comfortable and sound nice, the build quality is awful. The cable/jack & the headband broke from just light use..."
4,Great Product for the price!,"I had the first version of these for almost a year before the microphone broke and was no longer functional as a headset either because it was picking up noise from the broken microphone. However, these are by far the best gaming headset i have ever worn, or purchased. The comfort is second to none. And the crisp clear sound that they had to offer was unimaginable. The first time i wore these i was shocked to actually be able to hear as well as i could while playing my favorite FPS. And for the people comparing these to Icemat Siberia's don't listen to a word they say. I have owned both pair of headsets. And these are by far the more superior product. The bass response is undeniable, and the range at which you can hear footsteps is almost twice as far away. Hands down buy these, you will not be disappointed in the least bit. I promise."
5,A wonderful reference guide,"I'm very pleased with this updated third edition. I just used it yesterday to locate one of his buildings in Hastings, MN. I love the color photographs, new information and the addition of the maps. What I do miss in this edition that was included in the second edition, is the Geographical Index By Zip Code. It's very convenient to look up the state and see if I'll be near any of his works while on holiday. One can look up the locations via the maps, but I found the index to be faster. Still love the book and highly recommend it to any FLW fan."
4,I was there.,"Maybe most of the whistling you'll hear on this mix was done by me. I've always loved Tall Paul because of his energy, but let me tell you a little secret. The night really wasn't all that great. The club wasn't completely packed that night, and most people left as soon as TP finished his set. The pictures of the crowd you see on the sleeve was mostly the people in the front, and the back was practically empty. Nonetheless, I had a great time that night and whistled real loud because I knew it would end up on the CD. After he finished the set he stepped down the booth and stayed at the bar for a while, so I went up to him, congratulated him and thanked him for a wonderful set.OK, so it probably wasn't the most amazing night in my life, but it was pretty solid, and I got my whistles onto the cd!"
3,helicopter,"Great company to work with. However, very difficult to fly. Instructions very tough to decipher. Probably a really cool copter if you could ever get it to fly!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Roll over, Argov","Well, I have only myself to blame. Amazon does provide a ""Listen to Clips"" link, which on this occasion I did not take advantage of. If I had listened to clips I would never have bought this awful, misguided album. I absolutely adore Sasha Argov and was at first disappointed, and then angered by this recording. It seems like somebody thought it would be a good idea to take Sasha Argov's classic songs and give them bizarre instrumental arrangements ""complemented"" by singers who cannot hold a tune. It's almost as though this album were an experiment in trying to prove that even the greatest songs can be destroyed if you really try hard enough. Listen to the double-tracked off-pitch vocal on track two; it's literally painful to hear.Do not buy this album. Try to get hold of something like Matti Caspi singing Sasha Argov. There you will hear the true beauty of this music. Meanwhile, I have a date with the trash can."
4,Certainly taste the difference...,"Depending on your specific tastes, this may be a good or a bad thing. I happen to like this pasta, but I also like most whole wheat/whole grain foods. You can definitely tell that this is not regular pasta...so it's up to you to weigh the taste/health benefits ratio."
4,Hearty and Healthier,"We've been using this for a while now (a few years) and the whole family quite enjoys it. My preschooler eats it without question. I've found the taste of the pasta (which does have a discernible nuttiness) is too overpowering for some of the more delicate pasta sauces (garlic aoli, a la vodka, etc.), but works perfectly in heartier fare, like Bolognese. It's our go-to pasta choice."
3,Loved it until their recent change to smaller pennette.,"I regularly purchased and enjoyed this penne for a couple years. The flavor is great and I like the benefits of the milled flaxseed. Unfortunately, when I opened my last order, I was surprised and disappointed to see that Hodgson Mill had reduced the size of the pasta pieces from typical penne to a much smaller (1/4 size) pennette. The smaller size does not work as well with my penne recipes so I no longer buy it."
5,My 3-year old loves this pasta and its healthy for her!,I was just at Whole Foods looking for this pasta as I had bought it somewhere in the last month and can't remember where. I wanted to stock up. Low and behold...Amazon has it at a great price. I made this with 50% less fat Alfredo Sauce and it was really good. I liked the texture of this pasta. You can tell it is not like they typical pasta but I like this one better! It helps that it is healthy as well.
4,"Good, toothy texture","I had concerns about ordering this, especially since it's a multi-pack. I always buy whole grain pasta, but I've tried brands that have a mealy texture. I like this. Be aware that it's not the same texture as white pasta, though. If you prefer soft breads to hearty, grainy ones, this might not be for you. There are other brands that maintain the texture and flavor of ""regular"" pasta but have added fiber (look in your local grocery store). If in doubt, look for this brand in the natural foods and try it before getting a multi-pack."
5,not like cardboard :),I really like this pasta. My kids like it too. This doesn't taste like the average carboard-ish tasting whole wheat pasta. One warning though and I don't know if it is just me but I find this cooks WAY faster than the amount of time recommended on the box. I recommend to stir and test often.
1,Not reccomended!,"I have made several passes at cooking, different times etc. results are terrible. Tastes like paper mache! Sorry that I ordered a case. Fettuccine is fine, haven't tried spaghetti yet."
1,Total Crap,"So, I watched this movie by mistake, confusing it with with the French zombie movie, also titled Mutants. This movie was on par with the midnight showings on the Scifi channel. Complete crap and the cover has nothing to do with anything. Horrible acting, terrible faked accents and a stupid plot. Its about a man wanting to take over the sugar industry by making his company's sugar addictive. Terrible movie."
1,horrible movie,"let's see, where do i start .... this movie has horrible graphics, very bad acting, bad story line and very bad camera movement. extremely low budget movie. do not buy, definitely not worth the money."
1,A Useless Guide To Collecting Costume Jewelry,"I found this to be such a useless guide to collecting costume jewelry that it astounds me that this book is currently in its third edition. The only positive is that the photos are in full color. However, only a very limited range of pieces is illustrated. I found the selected pieces to be mediocre and totally uninteresting examples considering the range of vintage jewelry now available on the internet. Harrice Simons Miller's guide has mostly black-and-white photos but is a far more useful tool to the serious collector and a far better value for the money."
3,nice thought,This book talks about God/Jesus a lot. it has a spot for Journaling at the end of each chapter with helpful questions to get you started. i expected more of a memory scrap book and not just a journal.
3,mixed review,"The journaling part is nice, and I usually love the comforting Christian books, however, this one talks way too much about ""God's Plan"" and although I'm a Christian, I do not believe in that way. I much more highly recommend the compainion book, ""I'll Hold you in Heaven"" by Jack Hayford, which sites scripture without implying that your baby's death was planned and that God did it to you and your baby on purpose."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT EXCEEDS WHERE OTHERS FAIL DRASTICALLY. AS SIMPLE AS WE MAY THINK A SWITCHER IS THE QUALITY SOMETIMES LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS AND HAD A LOT OF NOISE COME THROUGH WHILE TRYING TO PLAY VOD GAMES AND COLOR QUALITY DEGRADATION. THIS UNIT WITH HE QUALITY CONNECTORS ALLOWED FOR EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY WITH NO NOISE. THE ONLY DRAWBACK WAS I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT TO BE A LITTLE SMALLER. IT IS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN A NINTENDO WII.
2,JVC JX-66 3-to-1 Component Video A/V Switcher great buy,Good quality product. Works great for all my hi-def components since my plasma tv did not come with many component A/V outputs. Great quality for low price.
5,Does the job,"I needed to connect 4 component video devices to my big screen TV and only had 2 inputs on the TV. After reading reviews of this and other switchers, decided on the JVC JX-66 3-to-1.I connect my HD CABLE BOX to one TV input, the JX-66 switch box to the other, and plug my ROKU (Netflix) box, PS3 (mostly used as Blu-Ray DVD player), and Wii, into the 3 switch box inputs.The video quality is excellent - couldn't tell the difference between direct connect input and input thru the box. Getting up off the couch to switch input devices reminds me of the old days before remotes and is a key component to my personal fitness program."
3,Switches but distorts colors,"I bought this device to connect an XBox, Wii, and Playstation2 to a TV with only one component input. It does function as advertised but it also causes a greenish hue to appear in every game and all three systems. I connected each console individually to the component jacks on the TV and the only time the greenish hue was evident was when the box was in line and all three consoles were connected.Recommended with reservations."
5,solid & simple solution for hooking up more devices on limited inputs,"This is the simplest & economical way of connecting up to three devices with HD component outputs into one component HD input. This Switcher is passive and does not require power (it does not have a remote control).I only had one set of component input on my TV left for my PS2, Wii, and up converting DVD player. This switch allowed me to connect all three devices to my TV without any noticeable signal degradation at all. I had this Switcher for about a week, and it's performed flawlessly.I gave it five stars because of the price and because this unit is solidly made without any frills."
4,God Knows,"The book is written from the point of view of King David after his marriage to Bathsheba and his falling-out with God. Although it is written with an ironic Jewish humor, there is a poignant undercurrent as David suffers the deep loss and hurt he feels now that he no longer has regular 'conversations' with God. Of course, marriage to Bathsheba is not everything he expected, either...Heller humanizes David with tenderness, and the reader cannot help but be drawn into his anguish. I don't believe I have ever encountered such an effective portrayal of a Biblical figure---I just know David sounded just like Mel Brooks!"
4,An interesting read,"Classic Heller style, but not nearly as clever or insightful as Catch-22. Some monotonous repetition abounds. Still, God Knows has some laugh-out-loud scenes and a very interesting spin on religion and the Old Testament. I loved the many embedded references to classic proverbs and quotes, and how King David recites the poem ""Ozymandias"" verbatim to his son Solomon to make a point. Solomon's character also came as a shock: a half-witted miser and plagiarist instead of the Biblical profound philosopher. Overall, an interesting read."
5,Hilarious Sleeper,"This book is certainly a new take on the Old Testament story of King David. Lots of irreverence and so much that is virtually upside-down. David himself talks to us - a lot - and tells us all. Some might find this depiction of an over-the-top King of Israel kind of blasphemous. I ended up with the wonderful feeling that God is good, all the time!"
2,Pretty Sophomoric,"In ""God Knows"", Joseph Heller attempts to tell the story of King David through arrogant eyes. Rather than finding David intelligent or witty, I just found him annoying. In a long book, this is not a good thing. The story seems verbose while lacking the strong social commentary of Heller's other works.The attempts at humor made throughout the book missed the target for me because the characters were beyond my liking. While I did find the occasional snicker on some pages, I found myself wishing for the pain to end. The endless jokes about circumcision were almost as painful as the operation itself.I have enjoyed Heller's other books including ""Catch-22"" and ""Something Happpened"". To me, this book just missed the mark which may be why this is not one of his better known works. Others may enjoy this book, but it is certainly not for everybody."
3,Entertainingly vulgar,Hellers portrayal of David presented a vibrant yet ultimatly sad character. I found much of the language a bit vulgar for my taste. I'll never look at the biblical David in the same way.
2,Boring,This is one of the few Globe Trekker shows I did not like. It seemed rushed. They used two hosts on this show which caused them to bounce back and forth loosing plot lines. But the good points are great video shots of the beautiful and exciting city of London. The DVD is worth that alone.
2,Only Just OK,This DVD contains nothing new about London. It is disappointingly short and contains predictable video of the same old tourist spots in London. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of the Globe Trekker series, and I always liked Megan McCormick. However, this video was disappointing. There isn't a logical narrative to this video. As others have complained, having two hosts didn't work.What does it say when I forgot I owned this video until I stumbled across it?It didn't offer me surprises or compelling reasons to visit a place that hasn't been better covered by others like Rick Steves."
4,Book,This book is well written. Used it for a class at seminary. It is an easy read and brings understanding to the culture of that time.
3,A few good tracks,"54th Platoon provides us with a solid rookie effort. It's not good, but it's not bad. The CD is very short, with way to many skits and half-songs. But, tracks like ""Holdin' It Down,"" and ""Pimpin"" (both produced by Lil Jon) make this CD almost worth the amount I paid for it. A personal favorite of mine is ""She Like."" I could bump that all day. If you like songs with good beats, and don't really care about lyrical prowess, you may want to look at 54th Platoon."
4,"It's ""All Or Nothin""","If you want an album that comes hard this is it. They did exactly what the album says, either they were goin' to bring it all or they wazn't gon' bring nothin. They really did bring it all on this album. It's ""All Or Nothin"""
3,Japanese Patterns,"The book is beautiful and the patterns are great inspiration but be aware of the following:- The images in the book are black and white- The CD-ROM includes images only in TIF, GIF, and PCT only (no .ai)- The license in the book notes that any commercial use is not allowed unless Pepin Press is contacted (buying the book only allows personal usage)."
4,Great Resource,"This book is a wonderful resource for graphic designers. It has an incredible array of different black and white designs and comes with a cd-rom for using them on the computer. Yes, it has no color, but with just about any graphics program you can change that. I've even used a few for background elements in artwork or for the inspiration for the designs of kimonos I've drawn. This is not a picture book, but a look into japanese graphic patterns. Very lovely."
2,No Color,"I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the patterns in the book were printed in color, even though the cover of the book sure is colorful. This book is fine if you are looking for black and white images. But, be warned, there's no color in the book other than on its cover."
2,Swirl Sand Cambridge Flatware Set,Bought this set the end of Oct. 2003. On the first use & washing in the dishwasher (soft water) the set began pitting & showing rust spots.Looks pretty bad when you cut into something & it leaves rust from the serrated knife edge.Wonder what the company will do to improve it as a replacement would probably be useless unless it was upgraded.Will check with the store it was purchased to see how they can handle such a late request.
1,stained steel,"Stainless my foot! I received these from my wedding registry and only just used them for Thanksgiving this weekend. After one run through the dishwasher, several pieces are rusted, the finish has worn off, and they are even pock-marked in places! I too threw away the box when I first took them out, and cannot find *any* information on warranty or how to contact Cambridge Silversmiths.I've bought cheap individual pieces of stainless for *camping* that stood up better than this. I wish I'd put Oneida on my registry instead of this crap!"
1,What a waste of time!!!,"My new hubby and I recently registered for this product and soon after we got it for our shower gift! After waiting months until after the wedding, we were so happy to open the items. Well, that was our mistake! We ended up having ugly, dirt, rusty looking spots all over the set after washing them only a few times. After a month or so, I was fed up. I tried different detergents in the dishwasher and such, but that didn't help. I spoke with the company themselves about a cash refund, due to the fact that the boxes have been discarded, but the best they could do was send me a new set. Well, that set did the same thing! After spending money and time I am fed up with this product and Cambridge Silversmiths. I am going to throw both of the sets away and hopefully have some more luck with another company!!!"
3,They look nice,"The set of flatware looks really nice, but it's cheap quality. They aren't very sturdy, the metal is thin. They would be okay for a second set of utensils, or for everyday use. But if the relatives are coming over, I'd choose something with a little more quality."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this new set at Target to go with my brand new home. They have many rust spots on them. I tried polishing them which helps somewhat but I don't have time to polish every time they come out of the dishwasher. There are pitted with some type of stain that doesn't come out. 25 year warranty doesn't do much good without the box.
4,Much bigger than I was expecting,"It's quite a bit bigger than I was expecting, but it provides a great cushion for the boat. We ordered two and one of them came partially deflated...need to find a bike pump and a needle to re-inflate it."
4,Boring,"When I purchased this game, I couldn't wait to play after hearing so much about the PC version. After I turned it on, I played it for a couple of minutes and quickly became bored. I tried it a few more times, but was still bored. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I would not waste my money on this game."
2,I got it for PS2,"I have PS2 and Xbox and I am assuming the two games are if not the same very similar. If you have never played the Sims before I guess I would suggest buying this. Its confusing at first but a little addictive. But like me, if you have had the Sims for P.C. dont even bother. Its harder to build/buy/live on a console and its definitely not as good as Hot Date or Sims Vacation."
4,I want to get this game soooooooo bad!!!,"I go on amazon.com everyday and check on XBOX games all te time. But all of a sudden, I had this interest on the sims games. So I searched for, the sims! And I kept on going down and down and BOOM!!! There I saw The Sims for XBOX!!! It was like a dream come true! It said it was coming out on March 27th 2003. I saw it on Januay 29th. Ever I always wanted this game. I asked some of my friends about this game. (They have PS2) They it was the best sims game that was evr invented! They said that it was better than the computer sims games. I am sooooo excited to get it when I am free. Please guys, get this game! You'll have one heck of a time! You'll be glued to the T.V......"
4,The Best,The game is the best simulation game ever. If you love simulation games this is the game you should get.
3,What a Disappointment,"After getting hooked on this game by my sixteen year old son, it took me about three weeks to pretty much master it. Imagine my dissappoinment when, after learning most of the tricks to keep my sim healthy, happy, fit, rich and employed ... I find that there's a limit to how much you can spend... no matter how much money you have!!! Highly annoying. It doesn't matter whether you get the money by cheating or buy working hard. no matter if you have just one sim working or four... you still get a set amount of things you can buy. I've now dropped the game out of disinterest."
5,The Sims,"The Sims for Xbox is a very good and addictive game.Pros:addictiveMore features than PC versionDon't have to wait for game to loadBetter animation (tree sways, can see car driving by whenselecting a house to buy in theneighborhood)No need for memory card since Xbox has a hard drive.Cons:Confusing at first. Then gets much easier."
5,It's good if you have the mind for it,"I love the sims on the PC and yes this version is different. But as for the people who find it hard and boring its because they do not have the mind for strategy games. Its a good game, not as good as the PC expecially if you are accustom to all of the upgrades and version packs. Its nice because you have goals and objectives and in Get A Life mode you can conquer the game. I would tell anyone who enjoys The Sims to buy this game. Its fun in a new way for the Sims!"
4,ok but computer version better,i did not but this but i rented it and i have to say that the sims for the computer is way better. the xbox version is good but it is very hard a little to hard i think and i've been playing the sims since it was released a few years ago so i am not new to the game. all in all its ok but i recommed the computer version.
5,Outstanding CD,"These are three of the most beautiful female voices ever, and their harmonies are just lovely. You really should buy this c.d."
2,Ghost Ship,"I bought and read this book for a book club selection. Overall, it was ""not my cup of tea."" I think the author did pretty well, but it becomes apparent early on what the outcome is going to be and there is not much incentive to keep reading. Having been to both Hatteras and Portland, Maine, I did enjoy descriptions of those places in the early 1900s. Think you would have to really be a shipwreck buff to like this one."
2,"good music, bad sound","Music is good, but sound is horrible. I can't believe this is DDD (all digital). I wanted to have a few Glazunov pieces, but next time I wouls avoid Naxos record."
4,Learn the Language of the Church,This is an excellent book for the study of Ecclesiastical Latin. My study is with a small group and teacher. The Answer Key book by John R. Dunlap is a must-have companion for me.
3,Awkward text to use,"I find the sheer size of the book awkward to use. To do the exercises, the small dictionary in the back is useful, but I'm constantly flipping around the book. A section with all the endings for nouns, verbs, etc would have been useful, or a spiral bound version to make it easier to flip round the book. I'd love a list of prepositions with what declension they use."
4,For anyone who wants to read the Vulgate Bible,"Extremely useful book; I used it in conjunction with a class, but you could easily review or learn Latin if you also buy the Answer Key. Lots of exercises & readings towards the end. Not a ton of drills or ""regurgitation"" exercises, which might be ok for some; others may need additional workbooks to practice verb conjugations & noun declensions. Overall a good investment!"
5,Learning Latin,This book is the perfect companion to the Collins Ecclesiastical Latin book and a neccesary accompaniment if you are working on your own.
3,Early days,"Primer of Ecclesiastical LatinI placed an order for this item (and its associated key) from an address in the U.K. A prompt acknowledgement assured me that this item would be despatched and would take about 3 weeks shipped from the U.S. It has now arrived, well packed and in good order.It is early days yet to assess the usefulness of this item but, on early inspection, this seems to provide me with the specific information I require to translate latin documents and inscriptions here in the U.K.I can find no U.K. publication covering the same subject - most are concerned with 'classical Latin' and already I am discovering the differences of these two modes of Latin usage."
5,Terrific for self-study or classroom use.,"I first learned Latin with this book in a graduate classroom, I have reviewed various points on my own numerous times with the help of this wonderfully organized work, and over the last few years I have even successfully taught Latin to adults and children using Collins' work. There is, I feel, no better text for ecclesiastical Latin on the market, and it deserves to be ranked on par with such academic standards as Wheelock or Henle (both of which stress classical, not ecclesiastical, Latin)."
5,I am writing a review,"After spending some months with this book I feel free to say that it is a great start to learning Ecclesiastical Latin. The book has plenty of passages to read with a whole cabbage load of vocabulary. The 35 lessons included in the book slowly introduce the reader to Latin and eventually one feels comfortable reading on their own. THe book won't exactly prepare you to read Aquinas, but at the New Testament won't give you a hassle. Pax et caritas Domini sit semper vobiscum!"
4,Very Pleased,I am very pleased with the game. The controls take some getting used to but it is a very responsive set up. The cinematagrophy is some of the best I have seen in a PS2 game. I am an avid Matrix fan as was expecting a disapointmant but I am very pleased. The Physics engine in here for game play is very realistic and the game is very pleasing in all aspects.
4,the coolest thing since the movie,"this is the coolest game i have ever played since Halo! i played at a friends house and was astonished at the graphics, the role playing. i kinda wondered why Niobe was a main character, but other than that it was supremely tight! i'm gonna get a ps2 console soon and that game is #1 on my list."
2,Thank Goodness I rented!,"When I saw this game at the video store, I was eager to get home, throw it on and see how far the rabbit hole goes but after a while I was starting to get pretty furious. This game is pretty fun once you get pass the constant audio skipping(which got on my last nerve!) and Freeze ups, this game has more gliches than the Matrix itself! I rented this game a few days ago and this is the fourth time I had to reset it, now my screen has frozen yet again and I'm not gonna bother to reset it again. Instead I'm gonna take this bugged up game back to blockbuster and drop it in it's own hole...the drop box!"
3,easy game could have been alot better!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"reasonable game but it can get repeditive and meaningless after a time!!!!!!!!!what is it with the dumb car case?????? it served no true purpose, it totally lacked substance.... and the ship in the worm hole urrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!there was so much other avenues that could have been explored where did Neo fit in ??? by the way where is Neo?? i finished this game in a mere 6 hours, i am a little disappointed because the hype made on this game really had me exited!!!!!!! don't buy this game (please) borrow it from a friend or rent it, all in all its limited or did i mention that the graphics sucks ""there! i said it"" if you get this free in a couple of weeks you'll give it to the neigbours 5 year old he's about the only person who will say wow!!! laterzzzzzzfolks!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Pretty fun,"I thought this game had a lot of promise, although it shines in fun and gameplay it still has some faults.This game suffers from a lot of load times, but if you are a fan of the Matrix series and a mindless beat 'em up, this game is for you. Otherwise you might want to consider renting it. The hacking system is a blast and so are the FMVs, this game really adds to the story of the Matrix series."
1,Are marketers writing the reviews?,"I keep seeing honest reviews on this site and then within an hour someone goes and gives a 5 star review which incidentally focuses on all of the same attributes that the press release focuses on. I for one, find this suspect. What gamers really put so much stock in the story? This is the kind of marketing hype that the publishers use to cover up weakness in the gameplay (remember Lost World). Great games are based on great gameplay and poor controls and a camera that goes through walls are not the makings of great gameplay. Has Atari P.R. hired people to spike this punch?"
4,great game,I like this game i had bought it a few days ago and i love it is easy and fun to play you can move in slow motion and run on walls and also use a varity of diffrent guns also your health goes up tell it is full witch i like because i have problems with in diffrent games with health but it is to short and multi players is a cheat thats pretty stupied and you can only be ghost or niobe what about neo. anyway if you dont have lot of spare time and like action packed games go and buy this one.
4,RELOADED,THIS GAME KICKS MAJOR ... I WANTED TO GIVE IT 4.5 STARS BUT I COULDNT IT IS LOADED WITH ACTION AND ALOT OF SURPRISES. THE FIGHT SCENES KICK ... NOT TO MENTION THE BULLET TIME. IT DEFINATLY BEATS MAX PAYNE. BUT HEY IT WAS THE MATRIX THAT CREATED BULLET TIME. THERE IS SO MUCH OF THE GAME TO STILL FIND OUT. BUT WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT SO FAR IS COOL ENOUGH. ... I NOTICED AN ANOYING ECHO IN THE VOICE AUDIO. DURING SOME SCENES. WHEN I REPLAYED THE SAME SCENE AGAIN. THE ECHO WENT AWAY. AND THEN AGAIN IT WOULD COME BACK AT TIMES. SO THAT IS MY MAIN FLAW IM NOT SURE WHAT MAY BE THE PROBLEM. BUT THE GAME IS STILL TIGHT.
2,Terrible!,Where do I start? The controls are second rate and overly complex. There are some moves available but you will get sick trying to perform them since the button configuration is stinky. The graphics are dated. The worst thing about this game is the gameplay. It's just a Punch/Kick beat-em-up with a Max Payne Bullet Time function. The levels are repetitve. If you look beyond the Matrix aura you will see another bad movie tie-in.
1,enter the matrix,your game that i just purchased is no good it doesnot work proper way it freezes on second level all the time it made my son very upset and i assure you i will never use you ever again
2,BORRRRRRINGGGGG!!!!!!,"I didn't enjoy this game. With its horrible camera angles and repetive gameplay it just wasn't my ticket. The only redeeming feature that kept this game from falling into the abyss of 1 star was the movie footage. Besides that, you'll have better luck with MAX PAYNE."
4,This game is really cool,"When I bought this game I had seen the first movie and was really excited when this came out. I love the game, in focus the moves are unimaginable. I love doing cartwheels and running on walls. One thing that I never knew how to do until one of the last levels was to make Ghost shoot while he was in the car, and Niobe is driving and you are contolling Niobe. You have to press L1 to get Ghost to start shooting. The reason I gave this game only 4* was because some of the levels can get very frusterating because you have to keep some people alive, and it seems that all those people want to do is die. Even though this game may seem a little expensive it's worth every penny."
5,Jack-in and be astonished!,"If your are a fan of the Matrix film series, do not miss this game. The action is fast paced and will never leave you bored. The overall gameplay is decent and the graphics and soundtrack put you in the middle of the Matrix universe. The rabbit hole is deep... enjoy the ride!"
5,Such a cool game! Bullet Time and slow motion,wow. i played this game long time ago! but still very impressed with the slow motion and bullet time effects and the graphics! very cool
4,good game,"The game i bought decided to go black half way through . So i left my feedback , which i removed today because the company i bought it from sent me an email stating they will be sending me another one. I really love shopping on Amazon. I wish when people create games they fix all the bugs before they make it available to the public . Oh well i guess nothing we can do about it . But thank you abundatrade for fixing my problem and i look forward to be able to finish the game:)"
1,enter the matrix is one of the sorrest games i have ever played,to bad the game is not as good as the movie! the game just sucks you would think that all the money and time thay spend on coming up with this game that thay could do better than that. i give the game a one because thay did not have a zero there
1,This game is awful,"As much as i liked the Matrix trilogy, i didn't like this game. I played through the whole game, but i still hated it. If you're looking for a game with bullet time, get a game like Max Payne (even through it's older, i think it's much better)."
1,Fun for crackheads maybe...,"Ok that was wrong to say... Crackheads are too smart to buy this game. Steal it if you want it but I bet you'll be selling it on eBay a couple days later... This game is so stupid, just another way for the brothers to make a few extra bucks. Buy a modchip and download it on KaZaA or something."
1,to overrated...,...just cuz the movie was good everyone likes this gamethey make a great movie then release teh worst game ever madethis game is the worst game ever made i mean c'mon its made by atari and i eman they try to make it all bad...but the graphics [stink] and the game play [stinks]. they have guns but when ppl die no blood comes out this game really [stinks]its the worst game ever made
3,Not what i hoped for,"When i got Enter the Matrix, all my friends said it was awesome, and everything. I was interested in it. I felt it was a mixture of Mortal Kombat and Max Payne, 2 great games. But then the problem was...I beat it in 3 days!Normally when i get a game, i prefer not beating it in 3 days. But i did beat it in 3 days. 3 days worth of kun-fu/gun slinging is not worth my $50. Although i did not beat it in the harder modes, I didn't find it necessary. I already know what's going to happen, so beating it in the harder modes is obselete.I thought in the three days that I was playing it, it was entertaining, the mixture of kun-fu and karate. The graphics were good, but not what i hoped for.In general, the game was good, but could have had many improvements."
4,The game that is full of hype,"This game is a pritty cool game. Yeah yeah you can do slo motion and run on walls but you cannot be neo or anyone like him. You get about 20 different guns throughout the hole game. Also, you can play as two different characters Ghost or Niobe. Ghost is my favorite because he has the best guns while Niobe is the best at fighting. the game has weird controals but once you get usted to them you are good to go. Finally,you can kill civilians which makes it all worth while for me."
2,I'd rather not know what the matrix is,"The Matrix: Great movies, horrible game. Ideally this should have been a great game--the story is good, and it's captivating because it is a backstory to the new movie. Good voice acting, and FMV sequences..HOWEVER: the gameplay is some of the worst I've ever encountered. the controls are HORRIBLE, and the character movements are stiff as manequins. It just destroys any joy one might feel for being ""in the matrix.""Speaking of being in the matrix: you may look forward to doing nifty Neo-like moves. However, don't get your hopes up--there are a few cool moves, but they get boring and repetetive after a few minutes. This whole game gets rather boring and repetetive.You want a good bullet time game, play Max Payne (that's all this game was really trying to be), but leave the Matrix on the shelf."
3,Entering the matrix,"The graphics in the game is not too bad, and the game play is varied enough that you won't get sick of it, but there just isn't enough of the game. I finished the game with both players in the matter of 3 days and took it back on the 4th. It's not really worth paying that much for, just rent it out or wait until it goes platinum."
4,!! Buy it Used !!,"This game is not worth the price sought by most vendors. I purchased this game about a week ago. Though the game is very realistic, has some awesome graphics, and cool moves, it gets boring quick. Buyer beware, this game requires a PlayStation 2 memory should you want to save your progress.Final word, rent it first, than buy it used from Amazon.com or your local video store."
1,Craphole,"this game is the dumbest game ever invented. neo isn't even present in the entire game, and in the alley scene, there are CARS that fight eachother. obviously the makers of atari were cracked out when they made this crap."
2,Rent but don't buy,I played this game and it was somewhat fun at first but after 5 minutes of playing it gets old! The game is very bland and repetitive and the hand-to-hand combat looks a little cool but it also requires no skill and not much interactions. just to much money was spend in licensing and not enought spent on gameplay!!
5,The coolest movie is now the coolest game,"I have been a hardcore matrix fan since the first movie came out in 1999. I have been anticipating the sequil for months as well as the game, and the movie was not as good as i thought it be. But the tgame didnt let me down a bit. The game is one of the best ones out there. With the slow motion, and bullet time efects, the game keeps on getting better and better. I recomend everyone to get this game, even if you were not a big matrix fan. But this game is soooooo good, it may change your mind!!!!"
3,"hmm... good, bad or indifferent? (PC Version)","First off, it has to be said that the combat system is probably the best out there at the moment, and the simple ""bullet time"" combo system, makes close combat amazing. The cut scenes are first class, the only ones I have seen to match the quality (visual) was Red Alert 2. The game however is too short. It is the first time I have finished a game in less than 48hours (playing as both characters, esp as a chunk of the game is running away from agents. needing 4.5Gb of harddisk, as well as no multiplayer/skirmish makes it a very dissapointing."
2,RENT BEFORE BUYING!!!,"You will spend more time waiting on load times than you will playing. Graphics don't even compare to some of the other games out right now. Bad camera positioning is another thing. Really, really sad. Seems to me they just went ahead and rushed this game to get it out with the movie. Worth renting if you have a free credit at a Blockbuster. Other than that, leave it on the shelf."
2,Take the blue pill,"At first, I found myself throughly enjoying enter the matrix, but after just 3 or 4 missions, I realized that gameplay consists of a simple pattern: walk into a room, kill everyone there, next room, same thing, end level. Sounds like alot of games, but enter the matrix really just doesn't have enough to it. The cutscenes between missions use the actual actors, so the game is really good for filling you in on the parts we didn't get to see with Reloaded, sadly though, thats really the only thing the game has going for it.If you really like the matrix, its deffinetly worth a rental, but a purchase? I'd have to say, no. It gets boring very quickly, not worth your 50 bucks.PROS:Engaging, fun, cool looking combat.Sweet weaponsCutscenes with the actuall actorsCONS:No real substanceLags at times on PC, and even on the consoles.FAR too short.way to linear, no real environments."
5,Why does everyone hate this game???????,"I hate it when every one of you go ""Dis game is nothing comp@R3D TO THE MOVIE! HAR-HAR-HAR!"" I loved this game. Not as good as the movie, but by a short hair.GAMEPLAY: 10/10 Great slo-mo action, and You can play as either Ghost or Niobe. They both rock. :)!GRAPHICS: 6/10: Not the best, but still good.SLOW MOTION: 10/10: Sucks that it's limited, but It's still all food. IT's best to shoot in slow mo so then you know who and where you're shooting.SOUND: Music's great. Dialouge and Sound can be a little corny, though.OVERALL: Very good. Give it a shot!"
2,Disappointing,"Thankfully I rented the game rather than paying out the full price and having played it for several hours I can certainly say I am glad I did not waste my money.I'd have to say there is some fun to be had with the game, the focus time, the realistic Matrix style moves are all great and the cut scenes and sound effects are wonderful and will be enjoyed by any fan of the movies. However the game falls very short in terms of long term play-ability. The game seems to have been rushed to the stores and the game play is painfully liner. To me this is a game that will be enjoyed for the week you rent it from Blockbuster, but if you buy it you'll be sick of it very soon and sorry you wasted fifty bucks.My advice; take your fifty bucks rent the game for a week or two and save the rest of the money to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD!"
2,Exit The Matrix,"Maybe I didn't get far enough into the game to be blown away, but what I played was boring and frustrating. The controls were difficult to use and after expecting something amazing, the gaming event of the year, I was very let down. The visuals are great, but that's about it. If I wanted great visuals, I'd go see the film."
1,So much hype....so little delivery,"Talk about missing the boat. It seems like this game should have spent another few months in development and significant time in QA. The bullet time scenes are very ""been there, done that"" from seen in Max Payne. The framerate is inconsistent, the storyline varies from interesting to plain silly. I expected more and better.I guess that I would sum it up this way...if you loved Matrix Reloaded...go out and get a copy (cheaper to get it used) or rent it first. Just set your expectations to LOW."
4,Fun!!!!,"I rented this game at the video store, and enjoyed the playing the game, I coudnt my hands off of it,this game is worht buying for Chrsitmas, and its really worth playing."
1,paden,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you get it for 9 bucks this game aint worth any more than that. yes it has good graphics and the moves are cool but its the same thing over and over, and its extreamly short, i beat the whole game within 8 hours. the max time you have to spend on a level is 3 tries and by the 3rd time its really easy. i would say rent this game just to play it but don't buy it."
2,Fun First But It Quickly Gets Old,"Believe me: this game has NO replay value. All right, I know its cool the first time, and you can do some cool moves ( including with guns), but the levels are really horrible. I'm sure Atari tried to make a little diversity with the levels (Ghost and Niobi both venture around different parts of the level), but it's basically the same. The multiplayer is really stupid, too. You basically walk around in a little room with another person, no guns or focus, and ""battle"", although that might be an over statement. The game is really short, too. It takes no time at all to beat. I beat it in three hours. So please listen to me. Enter the Matrix is a waste of your money, so at the most, rent it, and then return it as quickly as possible."
3,Cool at beginning--gets old quick,When i first rented this game i thought it was awsome untill i beat it--i was thinking about buying it--then i rented it again and it just got old it would be awsome if they put a 2 player multiplayer fighting in it (now that would be awsome) bu they didnt and the game isent very long and the story is hard to follow--dont buy this game just rent it
4,Worth every cent,"this game is cool.from the martial arts moves to the focus feature.this game can get a little stick figurish especially shown when running.anyway the gameplay,graphics,shooting effects are excellent.the music is also great but it gets kinda eerie.u should buy this game just for the focus feature.GET 50 BUCKS AND GO BUY IT!!!!!!!"
4,awesome,"I rented this game and when I played it I was like ""holy ----- this game is awesome.""The best feature of the game has to be focus. When you use focus you can dodge bullets, run of walls, jump alot farther and other cool moves.Another cool feature is that this game goes along with the movie. For example in the game ghost and niobe get an important letter from a postoffice and in the movie you see niobe hand morpheus a letter. The actors from the movie actually shot scenes for the game.The only problem I had with this game is in the first level some parts take about 20 seconds and then it has to load. That really didn't happen in the rest of the game.I think this is an awesome game and you should definatly check it out."
4,god damn this [is not good],"I have played a lot of games out there, and this one has to be in the lower ten percent of all games ever. The graphics are barley standard, the control... [is not good], and the music is not insink with the game. This game has only one thing going for it, HYPE, HYPE, and more HYPE!!!"
1,The game blows,"After trying to play this game I now know why noone in the cast wanted to take part in the game eather through a likeness or voice.The game is garbbage,do not waste your time or money on it it is not worth it"
5,Cool as hell,"I just bought the PS2 version and it is one of the best 3rd person games I've ever played, coming in just behind Grand Theft Auto. The bullet time fight scenes are second to no other game out there. Even the real time fighting sequences are very well done. I'm not very far into the game yet, so I'm not sure if you can learn new combat moves or not? The movie quality is outstanding, comparable to watching a DVD. I've read that sometimes this game locks up when using bullet time, but so far I've had no problems. If you are a Matrix fan, or a fan of 3rd person video games, you should not be without this one for long."
2,Compare it to The Movie,"I am a huge fan of the first and second sequel to the Matrix. This game was almost a complete disappointment. The first thing that really sucked is that you don't play as Neo or even Morpheus or Trinity!! Now, you tell me how you can make a half-decent Matrix video game without our favorite characters!!! The slow motion features were pretty cool. Some of the levels were really bad but some were alright. The game is pretty fun to fool around with and beat a few times but the storyline is terrible. It's like a little bit of Matrix Reloaded but changed around a lot to make it bad. I thought it was very disappointing but if it wasn't called the Matrix video game and it was another whole thing I would like it much more."
1,Can somebody clear this up for everyone else?,Crashing your system or locking up in a destructive to compact disc nature is a serious problem for customers. Can anyone who's played it sincerely clarify any specific problems so others won't squander money with something that inhibts harmful bugs?
2,Lame Game - Rent it.,"Saw this in demo, and thought it looked great so I bought it. Played it a day, and am taking it back to trade it in. It['s bad]. Just another poorly done movie take off. Has some cool features, such as the bullet-time focus mode, and the sound and music is super. But the controls are very badly set up. For example, instead of using the trigger to fire weapons you press the black button??? And trying to aim the sniper rifle is almost impossible. You can tell this was a badly done port over for the x-box. No save function except at set points in the game, and inconsistant level difficulty. You'll play through several scenes fine, then hit one with two ""timed"" tasks back-to-back that are almost impossible to complete - not because they are challenging, but just really bad game design. Rent this one."
3,definately rent before you buy,i was so stoked to play this game. i bought it and wasn't impressed with it at first. however i played more and got into the game. but then the game ended. it's way too short of a game. although it is fun and will get you to waste a couple of hours on it. and the bullet time stuff you can do is pretty cool. however it's not worth $...rent before you buy!
3,Buzzzzzzz,"I am one of the few people who has bought this game. Personly i find it very exciting. The controls are mostly user friends, the character models are brilliantly done and the plot is great. The moves that niabo and ghost have up their sleves are amazing. The bullet time is the best ever. better than max pain and dead to rights COMBINED. But... to tell the truth, its buggy, choppy and the levels are poorly done. The audio isnt that great either. THe sound tracks and sound effects are great but...again choppy and buggy. These factors really weigh down the game. If you don't mind these and u want some GREAT gameplay then buy this game."
1,stinks major,"this game is the prime example of what goes wrong when pople try to go outside of thier job juresdiction. this game is an insult to the name of the matrix. its gameplay gets old quick and the fact that you cant even fight the agents stinks. the whole thing is no good, only buy it if you are a harcore fan and want to know the full story, othewise spend your money somewhere else. to play this game is to lose valuable brain cells."
2,its pants,"i realy think this game is crap and should not be sold because it is to easy. i also think you should buy some new computer softwer to improve the graphics. welcome to the matrix you will expereinse one hell of a rubish game and it will disintergrate in your very hands when you pick it up. RUBBISH GAME, DO NOT BUY IT."
2,Way too little game for the money,"WAY less game play than either GTA (the violence is cleaner and not bloody, but there is just as much of it). I'd say maybe 10 to 20 hours, max, less if you're obsessive with it. The modeling and movement are good, but there are holes in the plot (I thought it was supposed to be a stand alone story, but there are major plot flaws if that's so.) that are only filled by the movie. Also, when you finish the limited game play, it ends with a great big movie ad for the next movie due out later this year. That's pretty crass. All in all, while there are some aspects of this virtual environment that show promise, it seems like expensive cross-merchandising more than a real video game. Oh well."
5,One of the best Action games Ever- Ben N. at the games,this game is very very good and most of all fun it kept me entertained for hours and when i beated it i still came back for more the combo moves are awesome and using the focus mode to make things slow down a.k.a bullet time is neat also i also like how you can switch to guns or hand to hand combat i am very very surpised that this game snuck past with a t rating i thought it would get an m rating because shi* is said alot and there is lots of voilence anyways this game is awesome if you like the matrix movies then you must get this game this is the game that will keep you coming back for moreGraphics 8.9 the graphics are quite goodSound 6.5 i found the sound quite tricky i kept turning up my t.vGameplay 9.7 awesome addictive gameplayReplay Value 8.6 has a great amount of replay value also
1,Oh Why Didn't I Take The Blue Pill!,"Well, hmmm what can i say about Enter The Matrix; As a game tester for Sony except....Whoa......I found this game had amazing graphics and awesome DTS soundtrack score plus the cut-in scenes were definitely AAA+. The controls were slightly greasy. There were certain moves that literally froze up the game when you tried to mimic them ie. run up walls and Dodging the Bullets like Neo.Now, I know you're thinking this was the beta version but actually the copy i got was the final version. Be careful you could end up crashing whatever game system you own."
1,Nothing better in life to do,"I've read a review about this game in Game Wanker Monthly and I just have to say it ROCKS! I haven't played it yet, but I did a good job of envisioning it in my MIND! That trick wall jump is sick!So now, based on my very mental imagination, this game is clearly a 5. Oh, here's a rehash of what Wanker had to say: you can run, jump, kick, and drive. AWESOME!Clearly I don't understand the difference between a review and a discussion forum. So please, leave a follow up comment so I can read what you think of my REAL Ultimate Power AWESOME review. I won't be able to respond to you because this AOL room only allows one message to be sent for some reason.AWESOME! Buy it NOW!!!"
1,It is not the spray I buy in the Department Stores,"Not sure what is in the bottle but it is not the spray I have bought in Department Stores in the past. It seems to be watered down, very little smell and not the same smell."
3,"Good choice, poor quality","The bag was all I needed, but after a week's use, one of the straps tear off, so now I need to repair it. All I was carring was my laptop and a couple of books."
2,Disappointed,This book did not offer one painting secret that you will not find in hundreds of other better books on how to paint. It does include a collection of very beautiful paintings by Mr. Buechner but don't expect to learn anything. I felt like I wasted money.
3,It's not what all these reviews suggest it's cracked up to be,"The editorial review is right in stating this is more of an inspirational book than anything. There are a few sections of the book where Buechner gets into enough detail that it can be put to use by the reader, but they are in the minority.Look at the table of contents, then realize that nearly all the discussion in the book carries minimal technical depth. It is NOT an instruction book or tip book - it's a few interesting paintings accompanied by the meanderings of a talented painter.If you like Buechner or his work and want the book for that reason, it's a great book with a handful of insights as a plus. If you want the book because you're an aspiring artist and it's been recommended to you - everything here is covered elsewhere again and again, but in far more depth."
4,"Freedoms and Opportunities, a Next Hong Kong Story","A nice psycho-thriller of Hong Kong cops fighting the drugs, stretching, a reviewer could say, into Thailand and different bedrooms of characters' involved.A touching story of opportunities FREE people supposed to have."
3,Not An Action Movie,"The front cover said 'nominated for best action choreography' but there was no action to choregraph! There was one five minute action scene and can hardly be considered a shootout unlike what one reviewer said. There was good drama pertaining to hard drug use, but it's hard to fully appreciate the acting in a foreign movie because of the language. I buy these Hong Kong movies, especially Dragon Dynasty releases, for the action, so I was disappointed.I've been spoiled by Hard Boiled, The Killer, A Better Tomorrow I and II, Tragic Hero, Fist of Legend, and others. Check those out for some action."
3,Not the kind of movie you expect,"A good movie overall, but if you want to buy this movie for its action, don't. I did because I thought there would be intense shootouts and gun battles, but there wasn't any."
1,decent movie,"this movie was not what i expected, in other words, it kinda sucked there was absolutely no action whatsoever"
5,Great book,I am a big fan of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg. I find her books interesting and real page turners without the filth found in a lot of todays books.
1,My first and Last Rosenberg,"I had never read anything by Nancy Taylor Rosenberg before, and now I don't think I ever will again. I found the characters and their actions to be very unbelievable. The main character became so irritating to me, I stopped reading the book at 67 percent. Unless you already love this author, I'd recommend skipping this book."
1,Stay Away From This Stinker,"I read the previous book by Rosenberg thought it was going somewhere interesting when she pulled the old TWIN TRICK. Even though it was free, I should have been smart enough not to waste my time with this one, but I was curious about the characters from the other book who behave so differently from that one as to be recognizable only by their names.What Rosenberg did, I think, was write a plot outline and twist her characters into pretzels to try to stay within the outlines. Nobody is believable; even the major lies in the book don't pass any reader's smell test EXCEPT FOR OUR HEROINE who is a human pinball, bouncing off one BS story after another and treating her family as second class citizens while cleaving to the tales of a proven sociopath.The ending isn't very satisfying either.By the way, the Kindle version is so riddled with typos it looks like a first proof. Even free sometimes costs too much."
2,Don't waste your time on this; the author isn't a writer,"While this book has touches of authenticity from the author's prior careers, she's not a writer. A writer does more than string together grammatically correct sentences. There has to be transitions between them. In addition, there has to be more than cardboard characters, manipulated by the author with no regard to plausible behavior. Neither plot nor characters are believable."
2,Disappointing,"Having read most of the author's previous books I found this one disappointing. I found the plot contrived, convoluted and hopelessly muddled. The characters did incredibly stupid things for supposedly intelligent people, and the dialogue often seemed stilted and sometimes downright silly. I found myself skimming through some sections just to finish. I expected better from this author."
1,"The Revenge of Innocents, a review","This book was just AWFUL. The dialogue was trite and the plot ridiculous. The ending came out of nowhere. It was like this book was plotted and written by different people. I don't know if Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has a ghost writer on her staff, but the plot just seemed disjointed. This was the first Taylor Rosenberg book I have read, and it is probably my last."
1,plot and characters both a mess,"I suppose to get into ""suspense,"" you need a pedophile, lots of murders, and a supposedly competent woman who wanders alone into a darkened empty area just after having received a death threat. As some other reviewers noted, to consider a thieving pathological liar who incites others to murder, who pays no heed to the consequences of her actions and who is consistently foul-mouthed and minded a ""victim"" just stretches things too much. It's as if a pedophile in the plot serves the same function as a demon: absolves everyone else of responsibility and awareness. Add in forensic and medical improbabilities, and this is really a mess."
4,Continued success!,"If you've read any other Nancy Taylor Rosenberg books, you'll love this one as well. It picks up where her last one ends and the suspense is non-stop. There's no figuring it out until the very end. Enjoy!"
2,For Male/Female only,"I am a forensics coach with a mostly female team. I was upset to find out there is not ONE scene in here for 2 females, it is all 1 male, 1 female. We are in DIRE need of great writing for women...why can't we find any? We need to stop this trend now!"
3,"Nice alternate history yarn, but a flawed thriller","This is a detective novel in the spirit of Sherlock Holmes in an alternate history setting. The alternate history is fine, but the closed room murder mistery is lifted out of a very famous early detective story and should be immediately recognizable to any mistery novel aficionado. Still, it's a fun read."
2,NOT FOR RIS 2.0!!!,"The description should state this! My 8 year old son, who is a Mindstorms genius, has wanted this for so long! How disappointed he was Christmas morning. ""This doesn't use my pieces, or even my RCX"" he said--very disapppointing, and I think it should clearly say this is not for the CURRENT version of mindstorms. This book is completely useless to us, he cannot build ANYTHING in the book with his Mindstorms RIS 2.0 set.We have another book from this line, and it is for RIS 2.0, and my son loves it.Update: We learned this book is for the Lego Mindstorms ""Dark Side Developer"" kit (Star Wars). It is no longer made, but we found a set on ebay. Son loves it--and now this book, too!"
1,A very disappointing book,"The assembly diagrams are hard to follow, occasionally calling for parts not included in the set and the robots are flimsy and generally don't work. The book is no longer supported by the publisher even though the cover gives a web address for a free additional robot plan. The only thing to learn from this book is what not to do."
1,hated it,This product is unauthorized & has NO concert footage or music at all in it. I bought it as a gift & the recipient hated it. It didn't even have interviews with the band members.
2,OK music from an orchestral master,"Glazunov, like many of his time such as Dvorak and Schubert, composed 9 symphonies out of respect for the master Beethoven. Unlike Beethoven, each subsequent symphony does not get better than the previous ones. Specifically, Glazunov's best was his first, followed by his 4th, 5th, and 6th in close order. Neither the 2nd or 7th symphonies are very memorable. Both sound distinctly Romantic in melody and tone, but neither has the drama, beauty or richness of the 1st or 6th. Each has one great part; the first movement of the 7th symphony and the last movement of the 2nd symphony are quite good. Each symphony is a standard orchestral work; four movements per symphony, with each movement having a distinct sound. The sound quality is great, as expected from Naxos, but the music is only OK. In all, not worth the new price, but if you can get this album used and cheap, it is worth it for a Russian Romance music fan."
4,fast fun,"My grandson loved this toy. The only educational value is getting the car to start off right, but the whole purpose of this toy is to have FUN, and he did. The cars really go very, very fast. It is a bit loud and when the cars fall off they come off at high speed. He's only 3 and he was able to get the cars on the track after a couple tries, now he does it everytime. You may want to supervise due to the high speed of this toy. The cars didn't break even at the high speed ejection."
1,Dangerous!!!,My son got this for Christmas...we put it together..and I'm sorry to say this is dangerous..The cars come flying out and can hit my son and a pretty high rate of speed..
1,cardboard super track,"I'm sorry, I don't own this toy. but this toy is dumb. just follow these steps and you will have your own super track. for 4 months, collect paper towel and toliet and foil rolls { the carboard part[. when you have your desierd amount of pecies start bulding your track. you can tape the tubes together or cut slits and slide them together. tape works better and saves time but slits can let you build loops and turns and weird tricks. you do ethier method. leave two ends open for the entrance and exits. remeber to have supporting objects for track parts with nothing below them. you can use hot wheels cars or marbles. have any questions? if so include them with a reveiw for this toy and i will get back to you! SECRET BOUNUS: if you cut a few tubes in half and then add them to your track, you can see your cars go while on the track!"
5,Awesome Fun!!!!,"I have to say after reading the bad reviews, I hesitated buying the toy. I am sooo, glad I decided to buy it! It is so cool.The cars go around for a long time,except when you race 2 cars at the same time. I don`t think it is very dangerous,cars do fly off but I would worry more about my child riding a bike! Someone advised in an earlier review to buy safety glasses. Good idea...and adds to the fun!Extra cars are a good idea (Vulture,Road Rocket,and Power Pistons) are the cars to use with this track! Especially the Vulture!Very hard to find in stores! Had to order it online and the shipping charges [were terrible]! ....Otherwise,Congradulations Mattel!!Good job!!"
1,It's not Fireball it's Fast Ball !,"This toy is to fast & to loud. We got it for Christmas & it is going back to the store. It's scary when the cars come flying out of there. I would say its a dangerous toy for anyone. The cost it overly expensive for a toy that is not educational, or fun."
1,DO NOT BUY---unless you want an eye-less child,"This product is the MOST horrible thing ever manufactured. No matter what we try the cars come flying off the track at very high speeds. Enough that an eye could definetely be taken out, or some sort of other horrible injury could occur. I don't care what the age limit is on it! I am 31 and afraid to be near it. My son recieved it as a birthday present, and unfortunetely we threw away the box and the retailer would NOT let me exchange. However when I called Mattel they sent me a return label and are suppose to send me a voucher that I can use for any Mattel item that is equal to the price of this one. Please do NOT waste your money or time on this."
1,Fireball flop!!!!,"What a terrible toy! This is another example of how things on tv don't work in real life! The cars NEVER stay on track and shoot out at high speeds to hit the kids in the face and head. It is a deathtrap! It is so ridiculous! I wonder how they even made it run for the commercial! Don't waste your money here. Just call me, I'll gladly send you mine!"
1,"A [flimsy], dangerous toy","I bought this toy for my sons for Christmas, thinking that it would be fairly durable and fun being a Hot Wheels product. After many attempts to assemble the thing correctly, the numerous [flimsy] plastic parts finally fit together. However, it is very flimsy and looks as if it may crumble at any second. Do not try to watch TV, carry on a conversation, or concentrate on anything while this toy is in use. It sounds very much like an electric mixer. The cars fly off the track at a dangerously high speed; I'm afraid one of them may lose an eye! Other reviews did mention a safety net, but ours did not include one and there was no mention of a safety net in the instructions. Had ""Santa"" not thrown the box away, this toy would be returned to the store. I'm sure it will end up at my annual yard sale very soon!"
1,Don't buy this toy,I have the same issues as other reviewers - the toy is VERY dangerous. It is very loud and without the net is scary to watch. The cars leave the track even when there is only one going and they become projectiles. The motor running the cars sounds like a chainsaw as well. We are all scared of this play set - parents and children included. Peculiar how there is an addendum to the instructions requiring a safety net (there is no mention of this in the TV ads or on the set packaging)which after installation renders the set useless as it pulls the tracks out and the cars will no longer run for more than a second without coming off the tracks. I have loved Hot Wheels sets since I was was a child but I cannot get this one back to the store quick enough.
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"My son received this as a birthday gift. You need a screwdriver to assemble it. The cars don't run continuously, as soon as they hit the meteor & it explodes, which is every time, you have to reset everything. Oh, and if you ever wanna take it apart & put it back into the box, GOOD LUCK!"
3,"fun, but scary","Same story as everyone else. My 5 yr old got this for his birthday, but I'm very nervous when he plays with it. It's more fun without the safety net, but your kid might get hit in the face. With the net, it falls apart and doesn't work right."
1,Dangerous!,"I can't believe this toy has not been recalled yet! I was mortified after putting it together, and watching as the cars flew off the tracks at high enough speeds to hurt someone if they got hit in the face. I had one hit my hand and its still hurting. I am new to this ""hot wheels"" thing with my 2 boys, and am pretty much disgusted so far at the products offered. What ever happened to the hot wheels I had as a kid? All I can find is a starter set, but no good expansion sets. This fireball is awful. Oh well. I must say that my boys, ages 3 and 5 seem to like it...I just need to make sure they don't take an eye out."
5,Lasting Fun,"We've had this toy for a year now and it still gets play. It is very durable and we've had no problems with the track staying together with the exception of the lava ball at the base. The lava ball is not well designed and we quit using it almost immediately. It was no big loss. The cars fly around the track with incredible speed. We've never used the net. While some reviewers find the cars flying off the track to be frightening, it is our favorite feature of the toy. It doesn't work well with cars other than those that came with the set so we've had to keep track of those two cars. It is also very noisy. Within these confines, it's a great track."
2,Take the age rating seriously,"The age rating police are right on with this toy. My parents bought it for our three year old, and it only lasted a day in our house before we packed it up. In spite of some of the nay-sayers, the cars really do fly out of the loop very fast (even w/ the ugly netting). We didn't have too much trouble with the track coming apart, however, the net did gradually slip off of the loops.Ultimately, my biggest complaint with the toy is that it isn't that fun. It's a bit like watching a lava lamp: very interesting for about 90 seconds, and then on to something else."
1,Hot Wheels Fire Ball,"I got this toy for my son for Christmas, this was the most important item on his list and every time he seen it on TV he would get excited. Well that was before. After playing with it off and on for about an hour, my 3 year old was watching when, I could not believe it, a car came flying out and hit her in the arm. needless to say we packed it back up and took it back to the store. I told my husband as soon as they fired it up it look dangerous as fast as the cars flew around and I had no idea they would fly off just as fast. I am glad no one was seriously hurt, and I was not about to wait around for it to happen either."
4,Hot Wheels Fireball,My 5yr. old son got this toy for Christmas and he loves it. He is a Hot Wheels lover since he was 1yr. old. This is a nice toy but the cars fall out sometimes and only one car will last inside the longest. But what excites my son the most is how fast the cars go around the ring. It's still a cool toy!!!
1,Should be recalled ! Would have given 0 stars If possible!,"My daughter received this for Christmas. Luckily, my husband and I put it together and played with it first. The net was a suprise-no mention of it on the ads or the box which I felt was mid-leading. The thing is so LOUD but the worst part is that the cars fly off the track (FAST) causing them to become little metal missiles. It hit my cat (thankfully in the leg) but it scares me to death to think of my daughter playing with it. We are boxing it back up and returning it. I have called the Consumer Products Safety Commission and filed a complaint. I urge everyone else who feels this way to do the same. Perhaps they will re-call these things before someone gets seriously hurt with it. I have tried to call the 1-800 number on the box but due to high call volume I must call back. Gee, I wonder what the calls are concerning. I wish I would have read the other reviews on this website prior to purchase."
2,Expensive beyond inital cost!,"I don't know if I have bad batteries or what! My 3 year old barely plays with it and it seems to not work if the 4 D batteries are not totally new. It seems like the minute they start to wear down just the slightest, it won't keep the cars going. plus, I agree with most, it is not the safest toy! I am not happy with it at all, and neither is my son!"
1,This Sucks!,"This thing ...so badly. I bought it for my son and the cars flew off the track and right into his mouth. We had to rush him to the dentist immidiately. I loath this toy. When we got back from the dentist my son played with it again after i told him not to. I came back from the store and the dog was under the coffe table scared out of his witts.My son was truthful and said it hit the dog in the nose. I am throwing the toy away now.Thanks Hot Wheels You cost me alot,P.S.Im emailing thisto hot wheels and having themrecall the toy.-No longer customer-"
1,Not the best....,"My mom bought this for my kids. We set it up and they were SO excited to play with it. Their excitement turned to frustration quickly, though. When the motors are on, they're really loud and not powerful enough to send the cars all the way around the loops. They made it just under half way and just dropped. When my boys used a real lightweight non-HotWheels car, the car took off but didn't stay on the track. Instead, it took off flying through the air narrowly missing my youngest sons head. They thought it was hysterical...I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this toy."
2,Too much NOISE!!!,"This track makes a lot of noise and honestly doesn't seem very safe! It does not always work the way it's suppose to so my son can get very fustrated with it. The cars are suppose to eventually crash in the middle making the rock burst open but it hardly ever works right and is actually difficult for him to put back together when it does burst. Matchbox and hotwheels are the same company but matchbox's quality is so much better then hotwheels but hotwheels products seem ""cooler"" Boys love hotwheels so what can we do but hope they start making better quality items and keep writing reviews for other parents."
1,Noisy!,"This toy is unbelievably loud and annoying! The various pieces don't hold together very well and the cars rarely stay on course, but instead fly off the track and crash onto the floor."
3,To tired to think of one,This toy must continully be put back together every few minutes. Something was always coming apart on it wether it was meant to or not! It never lasted more than 20 sec. or so it was a real pain and very noisy to boot. Not at all what we were lead to believe it could do it was very disappointing. We should have just took it back but what the heck sometimes it just not worth all the time and trouble and especially after the box has been thrown away what are you going to do then. This was a gift from Santa and his gifts are always under the tree christmas morning waiting for the children. Guess I will hold on to those boxes this year and find a place for them!
1,Too loud even for a 6 year old boy.,Even my son can't stand the noise this thing makes! It is going to Goodwill soon. It really made him sad that the toy in the cool ads isn't nearly as much fun as he expected. Guess hotwheels put all the money into great ads and not into making great toys. Ripped off again by hotwheels.
1,Too Harsh - Agree,"I think the lesson is too harsh, as well. It's not a fun book to read. We put the book in the garbage after reading."
2,Harsh consequences,"My wife and I loved the idea of a pre-school book that addressed the importance of telling the truth, which is why we purchased this book for our two young children. After the first read, on Christmas Day of 2004, we found the lesson rather harsh with exaggerated consequences: Because Lucy lies so much, she believes that other people lie also. When her father warns Lucy's family that a ""Great Big Wave"" is coming, and that they must run, Lucy remains in bed and is swept away into the ocean. After all this has happened, Lucy's father asks nonchalantly if the rest of the family would like tea while Lucy is seen floating out in the ocean on her bed.The following day, 12/26/04, the tsunamis in the Indian Ocean took the lives of thousands of children in Asian countries. Unfortunately for the author, who of course had know way of knowing such a catastrophe could ever take place, I can't imagine reading this book to my children ever again."
1,Another extremist attack on our judicial system.,I am becoming ashamed of our country in that books like these are being taken seriously. I read it to see how far extremist right wingers will go in helping to trash our country. Incredible.
1,"Biased opinions, innacurate interpretations of events.","I wouldn't recommend you pay money to buy this book, nor would I recommend you waste your time going to the library to access the book for free.Although the author is facutally true in his information and facts, many of his arguments no longer apply to the modern day. Indeed several arguments cite incidences in the 1800s.In addition, his interpretations of the motives of the Supreme Court are extremely biased. Never before have I seen someone who is so learned on the constitution, unable to understand the relationship of this document in the descisions of the Supreme Court.In short, I was very disappointed in this book. Buy it or read it at your own risk."
2,Muddled and silly; but still rather lively,"For consistency and thought content, this book is disappointing. Still, the discussion is lively and a bit of fun, and therefore may be worth a look.The book's main thesis--that the Supreme Court's activism is ruining America--is undercut by the case examples at least as often as it is bolstered by them. This is not truly a thoughtful book. Nor because of its flawed content can it be seen an important addition to a national debate about how best to strike a balance between government power and individual freedom.The book is amusing, but ultimately shallow."
1,Waste of time...,"Boring, poorly-argued diatribe. Levin should stick to radio where his words fade quicker. When tackling broad topics like this he becomes vague and uninteresting. For a better window into the current argument about judicial activism, try ""Becoming Justice Blackmun : Harry Blackmun's Supreme Court Journey,"" also available through Amazon."
5,Super book for America's first line patroit.,Mark Levin is a first line patroit tring to motivate the American people to save their own nation. He give us the details and instruction on what each one of us need to do. This book is patriot instructions.
2,"Was Hoping for More Analysis, Less Block Quoting","The author is a decent legal thinker who posts frequently on NRO's The Corner blog. His posts there are thoughtful and nuanced. Not this. It seems to me the publisher ""dumbed down"" the book for its expected readership, diluting and flattening out the nuance and argumentation, leaving a lot of rhetoric, extended block quotes, and Rush Limbaugh. With the judiciary under attack as the only branch not currently under the political control of the Republican party, it does not surprise that judges have become targets of the other branches of government. There is surely much food for thought regarding Marbury vs. Madison, federalism, and the role of an independent judiciary in our system of government, but I think much of the analysis has been left on the cutting room floor. I'd be interested in an unabridged version of this book, or perhaps will just keep reading Mark's posts in The Corner."
2,Politicizing an independent body,"Mr.Levin wrote an extensive review on the matter and I appreciated it. In my opinion though appointing judges with ideology inclined towards one political agenda would not be the correct approach to the issue. I am not republican or democrat, conservative or liberal. I am an ordinary AMERICAN voter. I need judges who are impartial and interpret the law. I do not need judges with agenda on either side. If we go that way then soon we will be appointing polarized and polititized personalities to an supposedly INDEPENDENT body. There is already a name under consideration with apperant long history of lobbying and not impartial undertakings."
4,The Contradictions From the Supremes,"Mark Levin has written a scary book. While some of us wait with baited breath for the findings of the Supreme Court to be handed down on pressing and important issues, we now see the court for what it is by way of the author's research.This book should be serious ""must read"" for those who follow the political scene, to be used as a true reference source when discussing all matters Judicial."
5,supreme?????,Thanks to FDR in the 1930's the word supreme took on a new meaning in our court system.
5,Factual Reporting,"Intersting reading on an important subject, supported by facts well noted in the biblography. We need to pay attention to the subject matter."
2,Men In Black,"When I bought this book I thought it was going to be about our corrupt judiciary, what is wrong with it, and how we might fix it. I was a little disappointed in the content, as from the first few pages I discovered it's more of a right hates left attack on liberalism circa the judiciary. It has more to do with how judicial decision affect party politics and how if you disagree with a verdict that judge must be an ""activist."" If that is what you are looking for, I recommend it.I'm more interested in say, how judges use immunity to break the law, destroy lives, uphold blatantly unconstitutional government actions and protect their cronies while they fleece regular Americans."
1,Mark Levin - Will You Please Just Go Away ?,"Another classic spewing of neocon diatribe from the sewer that is Mark Levin's mouth. If Mark Levin wrote a book saying to go play in traffic, all of his braindead followers would go do it... In fact, that would be a great idea. I hope he writes that book. Seriously though, all you warmongers need to put the books down, pick up your rifles and go fight your own wars. We the People will gladly buy you all one way tickets to the country of your choice. You bunch of chickenhawks."
3,Questionable,"I do not agree with everything in this book, although the author raises many good points. The book is well organized and researched. Her theories of the Government seem extremly possible and should be taken seriously. I recommend this book, however, I suggest that you do your own research as well."
1,Mr. Levin is an idiot,"This trash is worthless. Mr. Levin is evidently unaware the majority of the Supreme Court were Republican Appointees. Roberts and Alito (Bush), Thomas (Bush I), Scalia (Reagan) and Kennedy (Reagan). Mr. Levin just can't accept the US is no longer governed by the laws of the 17th Century . . which is where his scholarship probably belongs.. . ."
5,Men in Black,Excellent historical and informative expose on how the nation's highest court is undermining our basic liberties and freedoms. Mark Levin is a straight shooter who tells it like it is and explains legalese concepts that are difficult to understand.
3,Judicial Review- pathway to power,"The supreme court has gained power over the executive and congressional branches through judial review. The original intent of the constition has been exploited. Mark Levin does an exceptional job giving the historical background for each chapter. Important cases are discussed such as roe v. wade, and where the judical branch has stepped in to far."
1,One star for the title,"Another slanted book. Levin gets a drug-addicted blow-hard (Limbaugh) to write his forward. What a laugh, this alone shows the legitimacy of Levin's point-of-view."
1,reality check people please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"before you go and back this garbage, lets just hold up and examine what the supreme court of the united states has done for this country in the past before lambasting it. the supreme court has done such ""crazy"" things like ruling against segregation in brown vs. board of education and giving people the right to privacy back in lawrence v. texas, or how about allowing people of different ethnicities marry in loving vs. virginia. these are just examples of some of the things that judges of the US have done for this country in the past. so before you decide to believe in this rhetoric, think about the rights that you have today and ask why you have them????? its the judges of this country who are protecting them, and its people like the author here who go about lambasting everything when they dont get their way. what crybabies!!!"
1,blech!,as far as mr levin and other like him the constitution has gone to h*** since 1870. I was offended beyond reason and i encourage people not read it just for its inaccuracy and unreasable right wing bias.
1,I agree--they ARE destroying America,"And they started in 2000 when they appointed George W. Bush as ""president"" of the United States.Does this author even understand that the court has been conservative for many years now? He won't be happy until we dig up Hitler and make him Chief Justice.And Regnery is a REAL unbiased publisher--same publisher of the Swiftboat Liars for Lies book. AND Robert Novak's kid works for them, too--so much for the ""liberal"" media!![...]"
2,A Moderate in a sea of Conservatism,"An interesting read, but is seriously slanted. But would you expect anything less from the person who nominated Rush Limbaugh for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize - and was serious about it!"
1,Conservatives are Destroying America,"Yes, the Supreme Court is destroying America, but Mark Levin has it all wrong. The conservatives on the court--Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, Thomas, and Scalia--are the true judicial activists who are (as the conservatives like to say) ""legislating from the bench;"" the narrow 5-4 decision by the SCOTUS to side with Citizens United is proof of this. Thankfully, the Republicans are finally waking up to realize the monster that they've created. Thanks to this decision, after Obama wins his second term in office, he can restore justice on the Supreme Court by getting rid of the right-wing judicial activists--the very activist judges Mark Levin *DOESN'T* talk about in this piece of garbage book."
1,Is this guy kidding?,"I noticed that the one of the cases he discusses in this book is Marbury vs. Madison. I never can figure out why those on the right continue to site this case in connection with their spurious argument about the 'true intent' of the founding fathers. The case was decided by men who were involved in the founding of the nation. One, Samuel Chase, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence."
5,my grandfather's son,I now appreciate Clarence Thomas so much more. He and others like him should be on the Supreme Court to ensure our liberty and freedom.
5,Stunning History,"Wow, the things they never tell us. Read Ameritopia first and then read this. You will be stunned and frankly, saddened by the squandering of the awesome gift of freedom and representative government as you see how the court has taken authority away from, We the People..."
1,Men in Black???,I'm curious whether Mr. Levin is aware that the Supreme Court is also made up of women? Or perhaps he wishes to ignore that in favor of his rhetoric.
1,Prejudiced writing,"The Supreme Court's majority does not like abortion or gay rights, & this displeases the author. Moses the lawgiver also had the same opinion as the Supreme Court. If the author wants to please someone, he sould write sceenplays for Hollywood, where those with low moral standards congregate."
1,How people like Mark R. Levin are destroying America,Saw him talk about the book on FOX NEWS Hannity and Colmes.Stuff in the book was contradicting with his previous statements.Wants to give Congress power to overturn ruleings.Is aganist Right of Privacy.
5,Fabulous Book,A master piece. This book will shake you to the core with regards to our legal system. Easy read.
5,Outstanding Book,"This book should be read by everyone it's well written, Mark has once again has written a real eye opener. All of Mark's books are great reading."
1,Levin should be listed as Editor rather than author,"Considering there is so little original prose in this book, Levin's billing as author is a disservice to the reader. He should more properly be credited as this book's editor, because it basically consists of block quotes from others, rather than writinh by Levin.Also, the demogoguery of the title is astounding. ""Activist judges"" seem bad to Levin and the others he quotes only because the judges in question aren't strict constructionist, Dominionist thinkers.I am extremely grateful I only borrowed this book to read rather than wasting my precious book-buying funds on it."
1,Really??,"What an elementary and simplistic world view. Not only scary, but dangerous. Alert to Mr. Levin - the world does not revolve around you."
1,"Finally, the Novelization",At long last! Somone novelized Lowell Cunningham's Men In Black comic that was published through Aircel Comics back in 1990. I was really thrilled to see this. I wait with baited breath for my copy to arrive.
1,This made the best sellers list?,"Wow. I guess the way to the best sellers list is to: 1. ignore logical consistency; 2. ignore competing arguments; 3. distort history; 4. bash your opponents with heat, but no light. What a formula. For those interested in a serious work about the same themes, take a look at Kermit Roosevelt's book on Judicial Activism."
3,"Long on problems, short on solutions","The book is eloquently written, in some areas perhaps containing more legalese than I would have preferred, but Mr. Levin demonstrates in many ways how the liberal courts have trampled on our rights and freedoms. Like so many other books, including authors like Farah's ""Taking America Back"", and Michael Savage's ""The Enemy Within"", I was left with an empty frustration upon completing the books as all three authors offer very little in the way of solutions. I would have gladly paid twice the price for the book, if as many pages were devoted to WHAT WE AS CITIZENS CAN DO! For the budding conservative author in the wings, capitalize on this. There are tons of people just waiting for suggestions on how to save our liberties, our freedoms and most simply our way of life."
4,It Takes A Strong Stomach,"LBJ is credited with observing that those who like sausages or laws should not watch either being made. I'd say that those who love the Constitution and American democracy shouldn't read this book.It takes a strong stomach to endure Mark Levin's excellent compendium of the Supreme Court's journey from the Constitution toward one world government and governance by judicial fiat.Conservatives should read this book to rekindle their fires and stir themselves to activism. Liberals should shun it because they'll reject its premise out of hand, despite Levin's evidence to the contrary."
5,"beautiful voice, delightful music","i bought this based on good reviews i'd seen elsewhere on the net. these little songs are delightful, and the piano accompaniment is clean and lively.the real treat here, of course, is bodil arnesen's voice- strong and gutsy on track #7 (tak for dit rad), soaring on track #10 (sloveigs sang), and joyous #22 (i liden hojt deroppe).naxos has included a huge set of liner notes with all the texts in norwegian and english. it's a nice touch.70 minutes of beautiful singing at a bargain price. another winner for naxos, and i hope to hear more from ms. arnesen on naxos in the future."
5,Gorgeous singing and the best collection of Grieg songs,"I bought this CD to learn a few Grieg songs and immediately became enamored with Bodil Arnesen. Arnesen's rich soprano voice contains just the right amount of melancholy for these Nordic gems. She is a highly skilled interpreter who does not get in the way of the music, and her accompanist, Erling Eriksen, does a masterful job of supporting Arnesen's narrative momentum.The CD's generous selection of 28 songs (don't be misled by the list of twenty above) allows the listener to fully appreciate Grieg's skill as a songwriter. It also makes one wonder why Grieg's songs are not more widely known and recorded. His best known songs, Jed elsker Dig (I love you) and Solveig's Song, are included. Many other lesser know but lovely songs are also here, including Fra Monte Pincio, Zur Rosenzeit (The Time of Roses), and Varen (Last Spring). Buy this CD to develop or to renew your appreciation of Grieg and to be introduced to Arnesen's exquisite singing."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this novel, particularly after MZB's other excellent Darkover books, particularly the wonderful and complex 3 books featuring Marguerida Alton and Mikhail. The characters The Fall of Neskaya were unlikeable and unbelievable. I realize that MZB has died and the series, if it is to continue, must be continued by a successor. But frankly I would prefer the series to end than to deteriorate to this extent."
5,Wonderful fragrance,"I discovered Dunhill Man by walking into several Macy's in my area and asking the women behind the fragrance counter what their favorite fragrance was. Just about every one went straight to the Dunhill Man. It has a wonderful light scent that won't smell soapy or cheap. Two things I really like about the fragrance is 1) it smells really good to me 2) it smells really good to the women in my life. They like my other fragrances, but they request me to wear the Dunhill."
5,Nice soft scent,"A very refined, understated scent. A powdery mixture of citrus, musk, lavender? or other flower, and sandalwood. I get 5 or so hours out of this. A little too sweet and understated for winter. A nice warm weather scent. Good for the office when you need a scent that is not too big."
4,short evening,"Not overpowering but very masculine scent. I usually wear this one for the evening out, not so much the day time. Couple pumps keeps through the night. At amazon's price I think this is a deal."
5,Good comfort and sound,My last pair of headphones would become painful to wear after just a few minuets. These completely fit around the ear and barely if at all touch the ear. They are VERY comfortable and I have worn them for several hours at a time while gaming without them bothering my ears.They also offer very good sound performance. I was very pleasantly surprised at how even bass sounds good in these. I listen to music with these headphones as well.
1,No Vista support,No support for Vista. The drivers included are only for Windows XP. I'm returning mine today.
1,NOT UNLESS ITS FREE!,YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE! DO NOT BUY THIS! LET ME BE THE LAST SUCKER! YOUR MOVE!
4,Spine tingling,This album is really about one thing to me - Ingrid Kertesi's version of Ave Maria. This is possibly the closest thing to perfection I have ever heard in music. Words will never explain true art so I won't try. I defy anybody to listen to this and not be moved by it's incredible force. Truly inspirational !!
4,Light pink scrubs~,"This only comes with a top and bottoms. It is a very pale pink and made nicely I guess. There isn't any loose strings or anything, but it is a very thin outfit. It is so thin it is almost see-through. I bought this for my kid for Halloween and am going to have to buy at least a shirt to go under and have tights for under the bottoms. I guess I thought for $20 that it would be the same thickness at least to the scrubs that I have. Since I could buy a set anywhere from 20-50 dollars and still have the fabric not see through in any price range I feel that it could at least come down a little in price. Otherwise it is what it is, and they fit my child perfectly. I bought the 3T and all of her clothes that she wears now are 3T, so it is the correct sizing."
2,okay while it lasted,"This phone was okay for a cheap cordless phone with caller ID, the reception was good, and the message waiting light worked well with vonage. All the other features sucked (like the phone book as it didn't store many names, and was kinda tricky to use). The phone lasted about 10 months, and now is dead."
2,Small and Convenient but Too Much Static,"I purchased this phone because I was looking for a basic, cordless phone with caller-id. This phone is small and attractive with clear reading buttons. Unfortunately, when I used the phone, I had to turn the volume up loud to hear who I was talking to. And the louder I turned up the volume, the louder background noise and static became. I could hear static noise coming off the person's voice. It also made my voice sound louder on my end.Also, it does not appear to have the feature of memory speed dialing. You can program numbers into a phone directory and then scroll through the phone to access a number, but I didn't see where you could program speed dialing.I do have a corded V-Tech Phone, which is working fine."
5,Drop dead gorgeous!!!,"I love these shoes. Got them in black and are they ever terrific! I own several pairs of Carlos Santana shoes, and even though they have not improved my guitar playing, I can look great just standing there :o)"
4,A bit hard to understand but my daughter loves it.,"We have 5 other Disney read-along books and they are all around the 10 minute mark. This one is closer to 23 (I believe). My biggest complaint is that the narrator has a pretty heavy accent and I have a hard time understanding him at times so I'm sure my 2.5 year old must as well. While I'm not using this as a guide to help her learn words, she is a sponge and tries repeating everything so I'm a little disappointed they would use someone with such a heavy accent. My daughter continually requests it in the car though so I guess she likes it well enough."
2,average,The reason I bought this game was so that my daughter and I could play a game together that had no blood and gore.It was confusing sometimes and we needed the help of a hint and walkthrough web site at times. I enjoyed it because my daughter liked it. If it weren't for her I probably would have never finished it because I would have lost interest from the beginning.
1,Worst game ever created (should be cremated),"This so-called ""game"" is one of the worst [things] I've ever seen. [Bad] story, [bad] voice acting and badly rendered environment come with bad controls. Puzzles are [bad], no clues, you have to do lots of thing ""just because"". Every puzzle MUST be done in a strict order, otherwise you cannot proceed. To find items, you MUST check EVERY pixel on every scene. Avoid this ""game"" at all costs..."
1,One of the dumbest games ever...,"I bought this game about six months ago. I haven't finished it yet, mostly because it is so boring that I don't care to play it. I printed out a walkthrough, but they doesn't help much since there are so many sliders, and things that walkthroughs can't help with. There isn't one character to interact with during the whole game, and the music is really annoying!!!"
1,Just awful,"The point of an adventure game is to string together clever puzzles using an innovative (or at the very least INTERESTING) story. The story will have clues as to how the puzzles can be solved. Though i know how difficult it is to come up with interesting and difficult pzzles, the designers of this game haven't stepped up to the challenge. Aside from theme, the puzzles have little to do with the story, by that i mean there's little in the story to actually help you progress in the game.Seriously, I wouldn't recommend this game to adventure game fans. Sorry-"
1,Awful,"This game was terrible - really bad. The graphics were decent and the puzzles had interesting concepts behind them, but the way that you had to solve them made no sense. There were many objects that you had to find to proceed in the game that you literally could not see; the only way to find them was to run the cursor along every square inch of every screen in the area and look to see if the cursor changed to pick-up mode in order to find what you need. This game was much more frustrating than fun... a big disappointment."
1,Mystery of the Purchase,"This may be an interesting game, but the screens are so dark that detail is impossible to see. I have run this on 2 XP machines, one with a flat-panel display and one with a CRT. Both screens are much too dark at even the correspponding maximum brightness settings. That, coupled with a very hyperactive mouse speed [also not controllable] render the game virtually [really] unplayable. I recommend ""SAVE YOUR MONEY!"""
4,actually surprisingly quite good,"I own more than 20 adventure games and I've seen them all the good the bad and the ugly. Dreamcatcher games often fall in the latter category but this one is actually good. I am haflway through it but I am enjoying it. The puzzles are especially good, they make sense and are well thought compared with recent releases that are helping to kill the adventure genre through poor execution (mystery of the druids anyone)?The graphics are so-so and I don't care too much about the sound either as long as the atmosphere is good, and this game does provide that.This should be enough for real adventure gamers (ever played Ripper? great atmosphere despite poor grpahics). So give it a try, don't worry this has little in common with tomb of the pharaoh or other mediocre adventure fare. Sherlock fans will likely enjoy this even more."
1,Very disappointed,"Dreamcatcher usually puts out very cool games, but this one looks like it was made in 1992 (and that's being nice). The graphics were poor compared to other adventure games, and a lot of the puzzles had nothing to do with the game. I could not tackle a puzzle sometimes because the clues had really nothing to do with the game, so it was hard to know what to look for. And one puzzle near the end required the player to LITERALLY find a pin in a completely destroyed room (like a needle in a haystack!). There was NO WAY of being able to see this piece, let alone find it, unless you carefully followed the directions of a walkthrough. I think they could have done better. Thank goodness I sold it and got some money back...."
3,Virtuosic however flawed,"Taking nothing away from Joel, this CD is technically as close to perfection as one could wish for. His playing has a warm appealing tone.However, it's not a TRUE bass sound is it?, after all, he plays on an instrument tuned in 5ths, not 4ths, and this results in the need to alter the key of the music - meaning it isn't historically correct.Virtuoso bassists such as Badila, Levinson and the great Gary Karr play these pieces much more convincingly, and much more musically, and although they may not appear on the cheap labels, they are a worthwile find.Take my advice, if you want to be stunned by the bass, buy the Badila recording of Bottesini/Tchaikovsky, not this!"
3,Pretty Solid (3.5 Stars),"I'm a Mark K. and a Modest Mouse Fan. Once you get past the "" oh...I wish he would have done this song or why did he do that song"" and really listen, it's a pretty good album. He took the songs and made them his own.I personally could have done without Convenient Parking and Jesus Was An Only Child...but Ocean Breathes Salty, Math Equation, and Grey Ice Water make up for them ...especially Ocean Breathes Salty! Ocean Breathes Salty is fantastic.I would have probably Preferred an album of new material...but still enjoy it."
5,Fantastic album!!,"If you are a fan of Red House Painters, Mark, or Modest Mouse this is a must have album! Fantastic album for the up-coming season. One of the best things I've heard this year!"
2,Part of me wants to punch this guy in the face...,"The other part of me says, thanks man. it's really a pretty cool idea, a tribute folk album to one of the freshest voices in music, that being MM's Issac Brock. From a MM fan, this album is worth listening to for a few tracks ""Neverending Math Equation"" and ""Space Travel is Boring"" come to mind. But the best track on the album is ""The Ocean Breathes Salty."" Kozelek's voice offer a haunting clarity to Brock's lyrics and it's really beautiful at times.Then, we get to the other tracks. Let's just say on a few, it feels like Kozelek is phoning it in. As in, recording a track without presenting any real idea other than, hey, let's play this song really, really, slowly with acoustic guitars, and I'll sing like I'm slowly falling backwards into a dark, dark chasm.My take, get the tracks, not the album... especially for a fan of Brock's lyrics."
2,I know...,"...let's drain all the fire, and basically, everything interesting, from a set of perfectly decent Modest Mouse songs and, instead, we'll substitute maundering, dirgey melodies, slow all the tempos to a geologic-time crawl, and sing them in a dull, soporific voice...yeah, that's the ticket. I like a lot of Kozelek's work, including his interesting covers of unlikely candidates, but this doesn't work for me...."
3,I needed something more,"Sun Kil Moon's first album was magnificent. It felt like a full band, though it was basically Mark Kozelek solo with guests on some of the tracks. This new album feels like a sequel to Mark Kozelek's solo album What's Next to the Moon - 10 reconstructed songs from Bon Scott era AC/DC. That album gets five stars! Tiny Cities feels a little lazy, and has some good moments, but is missing something really alive. I feel bad saying that, as I am such a fan of his previous work.If you desire something in a somewhat similar vibe, but more magical, I'd recommend What's Next to the Moon."
1,And this is better than Modest Mouse how?!,"First off, let me just say the man behind these lyrics has a beautiful voice and I admire him for wanting to reach Mouse's level by making a tribute album of the band. Now the problems I hear, in each song except Convenient Parking he drones on and on and on. Maybe thats his style, but you can't really get far doing that in each song. And what's up with that guitar?! It's the same sound for every song, just playing a different order of chords. I see some people posting that this is better than Mouse and this blows Mouse away, well why is it Modest Mouse has been nominated for Grammys and this guy hasn't? Why is it Modest Mouse was voted best band of 2004 by over 5 different best-selling magazines and this guy wasn't? Why is Modest Mouse's music better then this guys? Answer to all these questions can be found here: Mouse is more original. I'm not trying to rip on the guy. but I see no other way to defend music as great as Mouse's."
5,"Extremely well recorded and executed, connected my wife with her Swedish ancestry","Bought this for my wife for Christmas to try and get her into my listening room more (I'm an audiophile), she's of Swedish descent and loves Christmas music so I figured this would be a good fit. It met my first goal, she loved listening to it on my system, and I wound up enjoying listening to it myself much more than I would have expected (I don't typically listen to this type of music), the recording quality and choral performance is so fabulous. It's inspired me to start listening to other choral music, but none of the CD's I've listened to since have the same sound quality. The choir washes over you like a warm wave of sound, the pipe organ is understated and appropriate to the pieces, and the soloists are very good. Mostly in Swedish, with one or two tracks in English.tl;dr - I loved it even though I wouldn't have expected to. It sounds amazing."
2,Misnamed Book,This book should be named Cahaba River Canoe Rides & Float Trips. It focuses primarily on the Cahaba and deals little with the rest of the state. We were disappointed and are still looking for a good book on canoeing the entire state of Alabama.
1,sad experience,"I purchased this item for my mother as a Christmas gift. I've never heard of this brand before but Trisha Yearwood recommended it in one of her cookbooks. And maybe it is ok but I received a roaster that had a 3 inch deep scratch inside the pan that included punctures; actual small holes on the inside of the pan surface. The outside was heavily scratched as well. What bothers me is that Amazon performed no quality check on this item before it went out. Shame on Amazon. What a waste of time to send something out only to have the customer return it. And it is a big deal. Who wants to wait for a pick-up or drag a large box into a UPS store? And no, I did not ask for a replacement. I just didn't want to be bothered. Very bad experience."
4,pretty good,"Seems to be of decent quality. It will stop your splatters and even decent size paint drips down the side of the can from getting through to the carpet. I am not 100% sure it would stop major spills like plastic would, but I would still choose this because its easier to work with, does a good job, and has a nice permanent feel to it. (plastic you just throw away, and then you feel guilty, and then you tell yourself that our descendants are going to mine our landfills: like that's even a thing.)"
4,wow - cowboy vampire and its believable!,"When I saw the cover, I thought this was definitely not going to be a good read - it is so cheesy, but wow! Amazing character development for all characters and a story that keeps you on your toes the whole time.I have read all of the Maggie Shayne vampire books and love those and felt very enetertained with Ms. Knight's versions of vampire lore. Although she has some very creative deviations from the standard vampire school of thought, they are logical and really keep the story moving along.Amazing sex scenes and fabulous action packed story line make this one a keeper!"
2,not for me,"I read all the time. I usually only write reviews on books that I like but felt compelled to write on this one. I just couldn't finish it. I never don't finish a book. I couldn't get into the story line or the characters at all. There was too much reference to rape etc... I like the sex in the books I read to be about love. Speaking of sex, there was quite a bit of it starting in the very 1st chapter. I did skip ahead and read the sex scene in I believe it was chapter 10 after I read some reviews that said it was hot. Yes, that was the highlight of the book and yes, hot, hot, hot sex on the car. I am weary to read other books by this author now. Maybe I will give her another try. The Forever Kiss just wasn't for me."
4,A Cowboy Vamp...What's not to love??,"This book had all the components of a great story. The sexy hero, the beautiful heroine, the friendly ghost, the dastardly villain...and all were put to good use in this book. I love the way the hero and heroine had to learn to trust each other, and work together, to battle the evil that stalked them. Even the fight scenes were great, and I'm not a fan of violence. If this is an example of Angela Knight's talent, call me a forever fan!"
3,Not bad,"I read this book on a weekend and it wasn't a waste of time. I can see where this author was going. I thought she let her heroine stay in denial too long. Enough fighting already. There was a lot of erotic nouns, and the word ""Rape"" was used too often. I liked the hero Cowboy and his sense of chivalry. A vampire hero. The villains were good. I liked this book. I'm sure this authors' next book will be great. I will read this author again."
3,definitely an 'erotica' romance,This has very graphic sex scenes for those who may not be interested. I am a big fan of vampire romances and have read quite a few from different authors and Angela Knight has definitely made up her own rules on vampirism..this is way different than other books I've read. I like romance books with hot sizzling love connections but this was a bit too raunchy for me. The book has a decent story line but it's just not my thing.
1,No John Williams mean STUPID MUSIC!,"There is no way one can honestly call this Indiana Jones music with a clear conscience. The chords are off, and some of the songs are even missing NOTES! They slur when they aren't supposed to, they're giving John Williams THE GREAT a bad name! Indiana Jones movies are best ever in the entire world, and this ""soundtrack"" or ""recording"" or WHATEVER it's SUPPOSED TO BE, is dragging them through the mud! Horrible."
3,Not a soundtrack!,"Come on, Amazon, you list this under ""Soundtracks"" when it clearly is but a later rerecording of the original score. A rerecordings is not a sountrack! The average customer would think something you list inder ""Soundtracks"" would in fact be a soundtrack and would find out it actually is but a rerecording of the score only by going over the details of these reviews. It might be great music, but a rerecording is not a soundtrack!"
4,Actually pretty good.,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" I believe is one one of John Williams best scores. Unfortunately, it has been out of print for some time. This album contains excerpts from all three of the Indiana Jones films. They are not the original recordings but this is a good effort and actually is quite an enjoyable listen. I have gotten alot of enjoyment from this CD. If you enjoy the compositions of John Williams or are a fan of Indiana Jones as I am , I would recommend this very much."
4,14kt Gold Endless Hoop w/Small Cross Earrings Sardelli,"One of the reasons I don't like buying jewelry on line is because you can't see the sizeBut that's my fault for ordering themI bought these to give to my neice for ChristmasThey are a lot smaller that what I thought they would beAs a Christmas gift for a young girl, they are OK"
3,Beyond The Veil,"This book really went a long went towards me understand the underpinings of the male/female dynamics in Morocco, a moderate Islamic country. Having had virtually no exposure to Islam it was quite informative and an interesting read."
2,Feminism against Islam,"Book is in two parts . First section is women in Arabia before and after Islam, second part women in Morocco and some expantion into other muslim contries. Basically argument goes that women did not have any respect before and during Islam including during Prophet Mohammed (pbh) and only now they started to get some respect. I gues the argumet goes what is Islam and what is women's position in Islam. If you value women's position from Western standards that is a wrong stick to measure with. I was also dissapointed the way she was talking about Prophet Mohammed (pbh) with lack of respect."
5,Best Baseball Game Ever!,This is the best baseball game ever made. stop reading reviews and forget about the other sluggish baseball games and go pick this up. A reason to stay in the house on saturdays.
2,ok game,"this game is fun to play, and the pitching is the best of any game, however the fact that you can regularly throw runners out at first on clean hits to right field really bugs me, and the throw meter takes way to long. also the infielders will often move out of the way of the base, and catch the ball before the runner gets there, but not make the tag. this game is fun for the arcade style gamer, but if you are looking for a realistic baseball game i recomend the world series baseball games from sega."
3,Dissappointed,"The game is decent. But overall, I was expecting something better.PROS:- Great Graphics- Hitting and Pitching meters work well- Sounds are authentic and commentary is accurate- Player stats are extensiveCONS:- No user stats- Franchise for One Player only (you can't even play 2-player games)- Home Run Challenge is not as good as prior versions of the game- No Fantasy DraftI don't understand why EA Sports can have a game like Madden 2003, where you can play multi-player, create teams, play online, keep user stats and use Fantasy Drafts and all these are thrown away when they create a game like MVP Baseball. These are huge oversights in my opinion."
1,What Happened EA Sports?,"Don't expect anything near Madden, NBA Live, or even Triple Play because this game doesn't compare to EA's previuos titles. What happened to fantasy drafts - the best part of today's sporting games? Where are the special features in this game? The gameplay is decent but franchise mode is just plain old bad. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
4,Awesome,"THis game is awesome it is much better than triple Play, You have to have good timing to get the pitch meter to throw strikes it is harder than the previous series (Triple Play).It is chalenging to hit the pitches, not to easy but not too hard. You just have to have a good perception on where the pitch is, and have good timing. There are only two problems with this game. 1st There is no fantasy draft. And 2nd there is no dive-Jump button, so no wall jumps, but other than these two problems it is a perfect game."
3,Delirious? 101,"This is a good CD for those unfamiliar with Delirious? or those who don't have any of their older ""live"" recordings! Highly recommened are their newer CD/DVD Combos, such as: Now Is The Time and (recently released) My Soul Sings, which was recorded ""live"" in Bogota, Columbia."
4,Good for research or reference,"I do have Beale, along with 40+ other commentaries on Revelation, as I wrote a commentary on Revelation myself in the 1990's. He has written the most detailed commentary on Revelation there is. He is, however, rather verbose. He relies a little too much on Daniel, and as a result he gets the mighty angel of ch. 10 wrong, by calling it/him Christ rather than Christ's angel (compare Rev 1:1 with 22:6). If I have a difficult question on Revelation then I look at Beale, Osborne and Mounce, in that order. For the scholar Beale is a must have, but most ordinary mortals will, however, find Osborne more useful. Note, Osborne also cites both Beale and Aune.For a link to Osborne see hereRevelation (Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament)"
1,Turning Revelation into Obscurity,"Beale's commentary on the Book of Revelation is one of the best examples tobe found in our day of an academic treatment of a book of the Bible whichrenders what God intended as revelation (to reveal) to His people into amass of confusion and uncertainty.This stems from the fact that Beale's covenant amillennialism prohibits himfrom undertaking the text in a straight-forward manner because at facevalue it denies the very theological framework he is committed to uphold.Do yourself a favor and save your funds for something more reliable such asthe two-volume commentary (ISBNs 0802492657, 0802492673) by Dr. RobertThomas, which is perhaps the best commentary written on the Apocalypse todate."
4,"Funny, thought-provoking, entertaining...and a little bit crazy","This collection of Klosterman interviews of famous people in American culture, his speculative essays of pop philosophy, and one crazy hilarious unfinished-feeling novella were just plain fun to read. I love his style of writing, which I know many people have to hate, which makes me love it all the more. If you have every liked anything Klosterman has written, you will certainly love this. If you have never liked anything by Klosterman, you will certainly not like this. Fun and crazy. Read a sample of it, and you will find it is a fair and accurate representation of the whole work."
5,Klosterman at his best,"Though I find most essay compilations disjointed and wildly varying in quality between the pieces, Chuck Klosterman's consistent excellence has always impressed me. The selection of his best articles is what makes this so good. Klosterman has a unique way of looking into seemingly vapid pop culture celebrities and occurrences with an intellectual bent that's funny and intriguing.If you're a person who's ever found yourself thinking WAY too deeply about the implications of our musicians and tabloid darlings, this is for you. Klosterman's cynical yet self-deprecating sense of humor gets me laughing all the time. His writing style, though a little cerebral considering his topics of choice, is truly unique."
3,Little disappointing,"Had just finished killing myself to live and was really looking forward to reading this book. Was disappointed to see it was essentially a collection of articles he wrote for esquire etc, most of which I had read already."
5,Klosterman continually amazes,"Arguably one of Klosterman's best works yet. His interviews, essays, and short story are nothing short of fantastic.Also, his questions in between chapters never failed to amuse me."
3,Creative insights,"Klosterman's work reflects creativity and interesting insights into American culture. His major frame of reference is modern-pop music. Interesting read with fascinating ""what if"" scenarios. Good basis for discussion with friends. Worth the quick read."
4,"Great book, great shipper, great experience.","book is great. read it. if you like humor, rock music and the connection between The Real World and the real world...you will love this book."
4,Does not disappoint,"I love Chuck Klosterman, after having been introduced to him with ""Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs."" That one is still my favorite, but IV is also great. Funny, witty, observant - Klosterman says everything you think without knowing you think it."
5,great book.,chuck klosterman is my new favortite writer and podcaster (along with Bill Simmons). Love his writing on GRANTLAND.com as well.
5,Essential,"This cd is a must for the first 2 pieces alone! Gonis performance of Koyunbaba is (for me) far greater than the legendary Williams' recording. This version is unhurried, and massively progressive, utilising every note and passage to work the whole monumental piece. Invocation y danza is arguably greater than Williams' recording also..truly mesmerising. There are other highlights here, such as Dream in the magic garden by Barrios."
3,Get the High Yield TN580 instead,"This toner cartridge currently has a yield of $.015 per page TheBrother TN580 (7,000 YLD) High Yield Toner Cartridgehas a yield of $.01 per page and will last twice as long, saving you on shipping and waste (toner cartridges take up a lot of space in trash dumps). No one should ever consider this cartridge over the high yield version if you want to save money."
2,watch the warranty period,"Make sure not to purchase a replacement toner cartridge inanticipation of needing one. I just opened a brand new tn 550to replace old one, did not work, but since I had purchased itin September (4 mos ago) I have no recourse."
2,overpriced,"This is so not worth the money. I'd been buying Brother toners for my Brother printer for years. Not ONCE got even half of the number of copies out of one drum they advertise. Recently I tried an off-brand drum and was pleasantly surprised. For 1/5 of the cost, I'm getting as many copies as I actually ended up getting with the Brother product."
4,solid purchase,"I purchased a new Brother toner cartridge through Amazon for my Brother HL-5250DN laser printer. It's a no brainer to install and works as advertised. The vendor delivered earlier than promised. Assuming it delivers the 3500 copies over time - and I have no reason to think otherwise, based on past experience with Brother products - what's not to like?"
1,Poor Quality,Toner cartridge lasted 3 weeks. Suppose to be a Brother product. Suppose to provide 3500 printed pages. Maybe 1000 out of this one. Guess buying from the an office product store does make sense in some instances.
3,What Are They Filled With? Baby Seals? Diamonds?,"Who knows why toner cartridges have to cost so much? I bet they can make these for pennies on the dollar and they love selling them to gullible consumers. However, unless you can get better results with a can of Krylon spray paint and some beach sand, you're stuck buying whatever toner your manufacturer recommends.The page yield is always given assuming 5% coverage...this is about a couple paragraphs of normal text. If you start printing pics or graphics, expect the toner to run out a LOT quicker...Anyways, this works and it hasn't caught fire yet, so it's worth an average rating."
5,Lucille Ball Rules!!!,"Lucille Ball is my hero and she is such a good actress! This video is the ""I Love Lucy"" cast going to Japan and they run into a lot of hilarious problems, as usual! Lucy and Ethel sneak in some place where they are not supposed to be, if you love the ""I Love Lucy"" show and Lucille Ball, you will definitely love this!"
5,Kathy's Reviews,"What can I say, it's a winner... love the part when she is a geisha girl...they speak japanese, she mumbles something, best part...."
5,Brick City Stand up!!!!,I love reading books from Jersey authors! The story line for Sincerely Yours is sick. It was dramatic and the events that take place are so real! I can see all of the places mentioned in the book as well as the characters! This book is hot! I just wish that she didn't start sleeping with that psycho officer. Read it if you haven't already.
2,Teach yourself to debug Ghaly and Kothapalli's EJBs,"I dont think there was a single program that didnt have bug in it. Bugs in the programs. Bugs in the deployment descriptors. Typos and wrong statements in the text. You need to check each and every program, line-by-line, against the updated code which must be downloaded from SAM's website. Your weblogic 30-day trial licence will expire before you finish slogging through this book."
1,Don't waste your money,"I completely agree with TonyGreen7. This book was a total disappointment. How are you supposed to learn such a complicated technology when have the time you are fighting your way through typos, ommissions and grammatical errors. UGH!!!!!"
5,Didn't think this book would be so much fun!!!,"The Adobe Creative Team has somehow managed to make something that would appear to be a dry, sort of ""how-to"" type book into a fun little instructional romp! I REALLY enjoyed this book from front to back cover, as well as everything in between.Here's a few things I found myself exclaiming after completion of this book:This is a deliciously wicked step-by-step expose of Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and what makes it tick!WOW! A masterpiece and flawless achievement from the Adobe Creative Team!Thanks go out to the Adobe Creative Team. I doubt I'd ever upgrade, even if a superior version (say, Adobe Photoshop 8.0) emerged in the future. I have met my match--and I'm going to be faithful, thank you very much!"
3,Good,Adobe is just a difficult program to learn. I did learn the basics but i dont think any book can fully help you comprehend the power of adobe unless you took multiple courses hands on...If i had more hands on experience i might have learned or understood the book a little better.. Wish they had color imaging for examples instead of blk and white.Who does blk and white in 2010?? :)
3,Photoshop 7,"I found it impossible to unlock the files in Windows. As a result I am unable to save files for use later. The instructions for the manner in which to unlock the files was not clear to me.Which brings up the question, why are the files automatically locked in the Windows format but unlocked in Mac? Perhaps we will never know.The text is well written, save for the above complaint. If you are wise enough to know the procedure to unlock files, you would greatly benefit from this book."
5,Adobe Photoshop: Classroom in a Book,"As a person previously acquainted with only the most basic of Adobe skills, I found this book and cd to be a great introduction to computer graphics. The instructions for the lessons are very clear and the illustrations quite helpful. The lessons give you some idea of the scope of activity available to you and leave you with plenty of room for additional exploration. I love this book and will be using it as a reference for years to come"
5,A must-have all-purpose resource manual,"Adobe Photoshop 7.0: Classroom in a Book is a comprehensive guide to mastering the nuances of the latest version of Adobe Photoshop. Intended for digital photographers of all skill and experience levels, from rank novice to expert, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 has black-and-white sample menus and images on almost every page to illustrate various details of handling the software. An included CD-ROM with lesson files rounds out this superb resource covering everything from basics such as photo corrections and retouching to advanced issues such as layer techniques, adding interactive slices and rollovers, creating animated images for the web, printing consistent color and much more. A must-have all-purpose resource manual, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 is the book to get if you can only afford a single ""how to"" instructional guide to Adobe Photoshop."
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a comprehensive guide for my Photoshop software. I'm designing more intricate graphics, so I needed advanced information. This book guides you through the basics to very advanced features. It's easy to understand and the step-by-step illustrations are a huge bonus."
2,photoshop 7,"Although the book was a good value .68 cents, as far as good instructions it sucks Adobe really needs to step back and make the book more friendly, besides their photoshop CS5 program was not able to download on my Macintosh with OS 10.5.8. That is why I purchased photoshop 7. I suppose Adobe sucks up to the windows operating system. Just make sure you can download the program to your computer before you by it. Also once I downloaded it to my Mac, there was untold problems with the program (Mac compatible) Now the good news. Thrifty Books where I purchased the book took 3 week to ship it to me. I notified them on two different occasions that I had not received my book.They quickly replied when I also notified Amazon of my concern. The book went from Georgia,Texas,Nevada,then to Washington and finally Oregon Arriving August 2nd, One week after my class had ended. My final opinion, Never EVER purchase Photoshop 7 Never EVER purchase it from Thrifty Books."
1,No CD,"I ordered this item knowing a CD should come with it to get full use. There was no CD and seller refuses to give full refund stating that I was forwarned. I was not.This seller is a scammer. Also book was listed as new. It was not. Seller was Yuriy Radyk, y-man amazon seller."
4,classes in a book,I am just starting with the book but I have already been able to use it to improve some photos. It helps me to learn the terminology and how to move around and have the software do what I want. It is making Adobe less of a mystery and more of a tool.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make photoshop more useful for them and really know what you are doing.
4,Adobe Photoshop 7.0,"This was a used book and it was in very good condition as stated. I got my delivery without any problems and came on time. Only thing missing was the cd from I guess original purchases, but all in all I still am happy."
4,Photoshop,"Everything went smoothly from placing my order online until I received the book. In fact, I received the book within 2 days of placing the order. I would use this vendor again."
4,Adobe (R) Photoshop 7.0 Classroom in a book,"Although I am now using CS4, if I remember correctly this book had quite a bit of good info in it."
4,Good Tutorial Book,"Bought this ages ago, when I was considering Adobe Photoshop Qualification. Now, Photoshop integrates tutorial videos into its newer Photoshop models, but the Classroom in a Book was an excellent way to learn. It provides images on a disk to work with while you follow along in the guide book."
3,mmmm,"I was expecting a guided class ,instead I found no instructions at all, no exercises to practice on the CD.I was sitting in front of the photoshop screen with a picture and that's it.I guess it would be better that the publishers explain somehow that you need a previous knowledge of the program.It must be good for people who just need to upgrade previous knowledge, but I won reccomend it if you don't have it."
4,Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Classroom in a book),I recommend this book to anyone who is new or at an intermediate skill level with Photoshop 7.0. It is clearly written and if applied sequentially by each chapter will allow the user to become comfortable and proficient with all the basic tools of Photoshop 7.0.
3,"Good, but not quite good enough","As a Photoshop user for over 2 years now, I purchased this book as it was recommended by Adobe as a preferred study guide for the ACE certification test. I purchased the book and went through all the lessons.While the lessons were very helpful, some went over tips and techniques that those familiar with Photoshop should already know. However, I did pick up some new techniques and shortcuts to improve the quality and time that I spend within the application.If you wish to learn more about Photoshop as a basic to intermediate user, then this is the book for you. However, if you are an intermediate user and wish to take this in order to pass the ACE test given by Adobe, I would recommend you purchase another item off the recommended list. This book did not prepare me for the test as much as I thought it would."
2,Big sister scrubs,I was not happy with seller item states scrubs were size 4 they seemed more like size 2t they were really small and my daughter is really petit so I figured they would fit a little big but NO and to top it off the scrubs were plain light pink they didn't say big sister. Was very upset due to my due date being around the. Corner I was not sure I would have enough time to order other ones and get them on time.
3,Big Sister Toddler Scrubs,"These are really cute however I was disappointed in the color. The description says ""light pink"" these are no where near light pink. The color is exactly what they show in the picture. They are more like a hot pink. I ordered the 3T and they fit my daughter perfect. The ""big sister"" looks great. It's also in white so it really shows up on the color. All in all these scrubs are fine. My daughter will look adorable coming to visit her little sister in the hospital very soon. I think they should change the color in the description so buyers are not confused. I would recommend these."
5,The best,"Hil am writing this via the tablet pc by writing with the pen.This tablet pc is one of the fastest tablet pcs out there - and it has the best graphics card compared to all the other Tablet pcs.Using a tablet pc helps you in taking notes, (you can search for handwritten notes) replace your notebook entirely, change your notes to text.The tablet pc is small (A4-screen)so it is very mobile."
1,broke down the week I got it,"Toshiba is the worst! The computer broke down the first week I got it, and all Toshiba assistance could do in FOUR months from them is to tell me to bring it to THREE different places to get it repaired!!!"
4,Pornography and Erotica are not the same,"I wish the author of this book had realized this point. While the title suggests one type of literature is being investigated, it is really a mixture of both types along with a good discussion of the cultures which produced the literature in question. The book is strongest on the 18th century until the mid twentieth century. Primarily it is concerned with issues of censorship and the reasons behind calls for censorship. It is not a collection of literary examples so you'll need to know the literature to truly use the book well."
1,Stopped working after 3-4 momths,worked great at first. Transferred files back and forth from work to home. Loved it.Then... nothing! I tried 4 seperate computers and none would transfer files to or from the drive. Nothing I have tried has gotten it to work.If I could give it 0 stars I would because now it is just an expensive piece of plastic.
1,No ESD protection in the design...,"My 1GB Cruzer mini died due to ESD, so I decided to x-ray the unit and look at the design. Only to find that the controller chip has almost no ESD protection. These guys need to spent an extra 5 cents and put some protection on the stick.Also, I tried to get support and kept getting a runaround. So I have decided not to buy any SanDisk products ever again."
4,Good thumb drive,"This a good thumb drive for the price. The lanyard is not very useful to me; perhaps you will find a good use for it. It comes with 3 caps for the USB connection, which is good because losing the end caps for thumb drives is one of the banes of thumb drives."
2,Reliable but slow,"Thin case fits most stacked USB ports6megs/sec rd (40x) is just too slow for a drive this big.long 13ms access time is slower than most (1ms is good)writing is unpleasantly slow;came formatted FAT16, so each 1k file takes 16k andUSB1 access time is 30ms - almost unuseable in USB1 port.(reformatted to fat32 ok. If you zip all your small files, not so bad)"
3,be careful,"This is an ok buy for the money, my problem is that the part of the memory stick that you insert into the slot on your computer bends easily and then your computer won't read from it anymore. It is not built very strong, however by the time I learnt this it was too late o return the item"
1,Dead on arrival,"My Sandisk 1 GB flash drive just arrived and does not work -- files transferred to it are corrupted. Of the two other Sandisk products I have purchased (a 512 MB flash drive and a camera flash memory), the first works, the second doesn't.I will avoid Sandisk products in the future."
5,Great piece of hardware,This Memory Stick is just amazing! I have been using it for almost a year and I haven't had any problem. Both thumbs up!
5,Great performance in little size,"Very light, this memory has a little size that easily i can plug it in any usb connector of my laptop or front/back desktop.Very fast speed data transfer on usb 2.0, its work wonderfully. Finally, the color green of the led is very cool...."
4,Loads of space,Great for backing up a lot of files although I did manage to exceed it's capacity with my Outlook export. Only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the random software that came installed - I was just looking for storage not these add-ons so I found it annoying to eliminate them in the initial setup.
1,Always backup your sandisk mini. You never know when it'll die.,"I have owned about 20 different jump drives, from 64 mb to 1 gb.Sandisk, lexar, and a couple generics.The only ones that have died and/or locked up the USB bus and the pc have been the sandisk brand.Lexar had some ugly looking drives, but at least they worked without issue.If given a choice, I'd spend a few dollars more and get any brand other than a sandisk."
1,Must Be a Lemon but Beware J&R Return Policy,"I know lots of people love this device, but I've had a bad experience. With a brand new Dell D610, I isolated a problem that if I used this device and the optical drive, then on shutdown or hibernate, my machine blue screened. After about a week of xcopy'ing files to the device, I noticed that they didn't seem to consume the same amount of space as on my hard drive (by a big factor), and I could not delete files from the device. Upon trying to return it to J&R;, they don't accept returns on computer products.Be careful when a vendor other than Amazon is shipping your device because if you get a lemon, you may be out the money."
4,Very functional!,"This is flash memory that I really needed a true plug and play that had no glitches. I plugged it in and saved and extracted data at very good speed, even though I was using a PII machine at home and a PIV at work."
4,Great for Multiple Computer Users,"I bought this because I work with at least two, but possibly as many as four or five computers a day. I enjoy it because it works great on several different OS's...Windows XP, 2000, Suse Linux, etc. Transfers are fast.I haven't tried the encryption yet, but I've read that it only works with Windows...which is a drawback, in my opinion.Another drawback is that it's hard to attach to anything. It comes with something to put around your neck, but it's hard to thread that neck thing (maybe a needle would work?) Since it's so small, I would have rather it come with a keychain.Overall though, I am pretty pleased with my purchase. Of course, it will probably cost less and less every day here on Amazon..."
4,Handy for File Transfers,"I currently own three of these and use them for transferring programs and other data from my laptop to client machines and back again. They're reasonably fast, reliable and the size makes them convenient to carry."
4,Good choice,"I've had this for six months now and haven't had any problems with it. I transfer usually many large files (hundreds of photos about 5MB each) and didn't encounter any single error.I tested it on WinXP Pro, WinXP Media Center Edition and Win 2003 Server and it worked on each of them.It also works on USB 1.1 fine.The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that is a little slower than the Micro drive (about 10-20%) when copying files to it, but I guess the Micro one is newer.Speed was 5-6 MB/s for reading and 4-5 for writing (USB 2.0) and 900 KB/s for reading and 400 KB/s for writing on USB 1.1If you are interesting in a physical durable product you should probably but the titanium version, so don't step on this one.If it's too long to fit in your pocket or purse, buy the micro version. The Mini version is 7.5cm long (3.5'') whereas the Micro is 5cm (2''). Also, the micro version comes has the USB contact retractable, this one has a cap. Both come with neck straps."
1,The device died out after 3 days use!,"I've never seen a more poorly designed product in this day and age of hi-tech. I would have expected it to conk out after several months. But to die out in 3 days is a rip off. Well, I learned my lesson not to buy anything SANDISK again. We should dump all these useless stuff back to China."
2,Mini Cruzer Disk,I use this product for computer backup and love it. This is my fourth scan disk that I have purchased.
5,A great way to move data from machine to machine.,"Do you remember the 5"" floppies that held 300 kilobytes of storage? And then the great improvement of the 3-1/2"" floppies that held 1.4 megabytes of storage? We thought that was a lot, and it was for a time when programs and data files were 50K, 100K and the really big ones 200K. But these days with MP3 and JPG and PDF files being many megabytes in size, SanDisk 1 GB Flash Drive is the way to go to move files from one machine to another. Just plug it into the usb2 port of one computer and it looks like another hard drive. Copy the data on it, put it in your pocket and take it to the next machine. Now plug it into the usb2 port of the other machine and you have moved the data from machine 1 to machine 2. Nothing could be easier.The SanDisk 1 GB Flash Drive works as advertised. I think there can be no higher praise for it."
1,Counterfeit Merchandise,"I purchased this item through Amazon from J&R; Music. When it failed, about 3 meonths later, I called SanDisk. I gave SandDisk the serial number. They informed me it was counterfeit and would not service my claim. J&R; said they would replace it. I will return it to them within the next few days.Be careful. You may not get what you think you purchased. I don't know how this situation can be corrected!"
4,Good Package but poor instruction on how to use software,"The SanDisk SDCZ2-1024-A10 1 GB Cruzer Mini USB 2.0 Flash Drive is excellent it allows me to transport all my files to school and work with out the need to burn a cd it is quick and easy to use.the reason i gave it 4 stars is beacuse they is no instruction on how to use to software pre installed on the drive, ( i figured out how to use it , but that is no excuse) also the box that it came in was to big, there was no need to put it in such a big box"
4,The price is good!,"It's a good product and secure as well, because it asks you the password, but it's not that speedy. It takes a time to encrypt or decrypt any data. Despite, the price is good for a 1GB memory key, and can be considered purchasing."
2,Too Slow,"I've used two brands of USB Flash drives, Lexar JumpDrive and Cruzer Mini. Of the Lexar brand I've used both Usb 1.1 and Usb 2 drives, and I have to say that the Cruzer Drive is closer in speed to USB 1.1 than the stated USB 2. Of course, this is in relation to transfers of a large number of small files. The Cruzer Mini can handle large files fairly well. (Although, it is still slower.)For example:JumpDrive 2.0 Pro Cruzer Mini 2.0 Lexar JD 1.11 71.7GB file 7-8 sec 16-18 sec 199 sec28MB 916 files 96 sec 470 sec 555 sec(Note, these are write speeds)The numbers speak for themselves. The Cruzer drives are clearly closer old USB 1.1 speeds than USB 2. They're nice and cheap, but if you want performance, I'd suggest something else."
1,Shame on Sandisk!,"I purchased this item because I was told by Sandisk that their Cruzer Mini 1GB Flash Memory Drive was compatibile with Windows 98...it isn't, exactly. After not having any success in using the drive, I telephoned Sandisk and was told that the drive was only compatible with the second edition of Windows 98. This information should have been give to me during my first inquiry and before I made the purchase. Since the drive was available only from a merchant in California, the total cost of shipping made returning the item ludicrous, as it would have cost almost as much as the item itself. Poor customer service on the part of Sandisk!"
3,Uninspiring,Flash Drive only. No original packaging. No lanyard that normally comes with a flash drive. Seems to work okay. Not an experience that might inspire one to deal with this vendor again.
3,It's nice,"It seems to be good, I didn't buy this for myself I bought it for my brother for school but he said it works well."
4,san disk Cruzer mini 1 Gb,"I had ordered for a pendrive of 1 GB memory,I'm happy with the product i have received and it reached me safely.only thing is that the free shipping seems to take too long a time."
4,"Contents good, taste wears over time","Content wise, this is a good product! I'm very picky about what I give my kids and these vitamins meet my standards. (I'm no fan of feeding my kids vitamins that have artificial sweeteners or additives that have questionable research.) The kids liked them just fine the first 5-6 weeks, then started to comment that the taste was ""off."" Despite a new bottle, the taste is still ""off"" and it's now becoming a struggle to get our youngest to eat them (we found two in the couch cushions!). When we first got them, I tasted one and thought they tasted odd, but the kids loved them. I guess the odd taste I noticed has built up over time for them. I'll buy them again, but not for a while. I'm looking for another brand to off set these.Again, content is great! - 5 stars, Taste is odd - 3 stars, total score - 4 stars."
4,Bing Crosby Christmas show with Kate Smith CD,I was pleased with the CD. It brought back many old memories. Kate Smith was always a favorite of mine.
5,Excellent book for introduction to programming XML in Java,"Don't expect this book give you good, or even enough introduction to XML. It only gives you one chapter on that, you cannot expect much. On the other hand, this book really gives you insight to the XML community, those relating to Java. It provides basic programming in SAX, DOM, JAXP, Cocoon, SOAP, although they are elementary, they are enough for basic use.It is an excellent book for ""introduction"" on java programming with XML, they cover too much, you must have further reading for in-depth understanding of each topics they cover. I think you won't expect you can learn everything of SOAP in a chapter while other people are spending a whole book on it."
2,Good But Not Sooo Good.,"I bought this book after reading several reviews on this site. As more people said a small book is good to begin with, I bought this book. It turned out that is not the case at least with this book. I felt documentation on SUN's java site is more rewarding than this book. Some times a thick book with lot of ideas is better than paying for nothing!"
1,Bad book to read,"If you looking for a book with good grammer and easy to understand setences, this is not a book for you. Simply reading the first chapter would frustrate me; the author would should some complex example and then would mislead the reader that he would be explaining the example thorough. Instead, he would mention a small portion of the example and claimed that it would take too long to explain the example. For goodness sake, if the example is too complex to explain, then please use a simpler example - don;t try to impress the reader with a complex example only to refer to some other Oreilly books. Do you notice that he does not refer books other than those published by Oreilly?"
3,"Java and XML -- for pros only, not for beginners","Java and XML probably deserves 5 stars, but I can't understand the explanations enough to run the examples.This book assumes a lot of knowledge, even stating that you need a few extra books on xml and reccommends Java and XSLT, by Eric Burke (which I also own).I wanted to get going on some examples, but I can't get xalan configured properly.Java and XML needs a better outline. The author should make a clear outline that explains how to achieve a task and then explain how to accoplish the smaller tasks that make up the main task on hand.Java and XML is written from the ""windows world"" perspective. What about Mac and Linux?There is a lot covered here. Little introduction, almost no follow-up explanations; a barrage complicated examples. Kind of like a Slayer song..."
2,Major disappointment,"Major disappointment. It doesn't look like it's O'Reilly's book at all. Many examples but no insight. Difficult to read, when author is mentioning something, he is not giving clear step-by-step explanation and not answering all the ""whys"". For example, he says, there is DOM and there's SAX, there's JAXP, there is a parser form MS and there's a parser from somebody else. I heard about that already, I bought the book, because I wanted to know, what's the difference between them, and how they are related and how are they related to java.September 28, 2001 - 4 reviews - all five stars. Hmm..."
2,Not so good,Poor explanations. The author relies far too much on rather poor code examples. This is an easy way out - if you can't explain it just show some code. It doesn't work.The so-called UML diagrams in this text are not in UML syntax.
3,"Overall, an Okay book","Sometimes you come across a technical book that you can't put down, the language is clear, the examples are useful and the author keeps you focused. Well, this is NOT an example of such book.The author covers the subject, but it was a hard book to read and stay interested in."
5,You will be amazed at the results,"This is a well-written and nicely illustrated book for pelvic strengthing. It is easy to read, but the meat of the book is the exercises. Try them and you might find relief from your back pain."
5,fantastic book,"When i first got this book I was really excited but I found it hard to keep up with. I put it down for a few months. When I picked it up again, I made sure to do all the exercises while I read them, I immediately knew that was my problem. I think people that have not liked this book didnt' because it is very specific, the movements are very subtle and they dont have the patience to reread the same page over and over again. I find that when I do the exercises I still start with ex no. 1 and work my way through them one at a time. Someday I may not have to do that, but not for now I do since there is so much concentration needed. I highly recommend this to all people, but know that it takes yes, effort!"
2,A Disappointment,"Based upon previous customer reviews, I was very excited about getting this book. I thought that it would help me to resolve my problems with my lower back - herniated disk L5-S1, and add flexibility. Instead it's much more of a discussion of how the pelvic bowl and floor work along with imagery of what they look like in action. It provides very little practical information about how to improve any problem areas or strengthening them. Most of the pictures are based upon the female pelvic structure, and I think the cover picture is designed just to attract male attention. This book was a waste of my time and money. Dn't waste yours!"
3,"Promising, but....","I read the reviews and listened to the sample clips which intrigued me enough to purchase this CD.Many parts of Dracula are quite inspired. The uniqueness of the sound and composition lends a great deal of emotion and mystery to the music. It is an outstanding example of what is possible when we shed the conventions of music and allow for imagination.Having said that, these passages of inspired composition are linked together with the stereotypical, uninspired, and droning ballet music. These sections seem overly long and out of place compared to their much superior, more unique counterparts. I spent much of my time listening, waiting expectantly for another inspired passage.$9.00 was about right for the price. Any more and I would have been upset with what I found.At this price, it is a curiosity to have, but certainly not a must have in my collection."
2,Awful,"I rented this book on CD for a long drive and it was so bad, that my daughter said ""Mom turn this off it is stupid"". I agreed but we finished it anyway. It was the worst Fern Michaels book ever. So ridiculous you had to laugh. I gave the two stars because it took time to write. That is the only reason. Don't waste your time."
1,Ridiculous,"That's the most ridiculous book I've ever red. Stupid plot, stupid story....badly told. I have no idea why this book was even published."
4,I personally....,"loved it. It left room for some improvement, though. I loved the tales of romance..the bickering..the dog...yeah..I couldn't put this one down. This is the first of hers I've read and I am hooked."
4,A little bit different,"This story was a little bit different because the main character was training for the FBI, and then goes on to train for a top secret force of some kind. Because of the uniqueness of this story I liked it. I also liked how a little mystery and suspense came into play with out overpowering the whole book. Nice romance."
1,GARBAGE,"Miss Michaels used to actually write good books. Check out her Texas series. The last few years she had been putting out complete rubish. This one the worst so far, makes no sense,the story is completely horrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Give it to charity instead...."
1,Terrible,"Probably the worst book that I've ever read. I can't even believe that it was allowed to be published. It was overflowing with the most asinine dialogue that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The characters were completely unlikable, and the plot was ridiculous. I have to wonder if the author was in her right mind while she was writing this. I also think she used way too many cliches in her writing (i.e, ""...he would have been all over it like white on rice...""). Shows a lack of imagination and creativity, in my opinion. Just a pet peeve of mine.Anyway, a waste of time unless you want a good laugh. But mostly, it just made me feel really bad for the author. She looks like a nice lady. This must be terribly embarrassing for her."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The book reads like it was written by a 9th grader who hasn't learned about plot or dialogue. You have no idea what the characters are like because she does not describe them; they are one dimentional and babble instead of talk. The plot is not sound, it skips months and then slows down to an unbearable pace. The concept is assinine and I only forced myself through this book because I paid $8 for it. I kept hoping for it to get better. This is my first Fern Michaels book, and my last!!"
1,Zero Stars?,This book suffers from an unbelievable storyline - How do a CPA and a washed-up supermodel wind up at the FBI academy? - and the plot goes downhill from there. It also suffers from poor editing which leads to major contradictions in consecutive pages. This is the first Fern Michaels book I have read...and the last.
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!!!","Wow, Glad to see I am not the only one who thought this was the most ridiculous book they've wasted their time to read. What woman, much less five, would go willingly to a 'secret location' and commit a year of their lives with a man who breaks into their house (well, Sam's house) in the middle of the night? That's only the first completely implausible plot here. I bought this book and read it because one of my friends loves Fern Michaels. I'm not sure why. This book was stupid, stupid, stupid!!! I'm gonna donate this to my local library as soon as possible so none of my friends even see this deplorable book in my stack of books read or to read."
1,Ridiculous!! Truly awful,"This book was completely ridiculous. The timeline was hard to follow. The dialogue and plot were unrealistic - like a high level super spy saying ""This stinks!"" My main question is how do an accountant and a super model just show up at Quantico to train for the FBI out of nowhere??? They would need some sort of training. Fern also left out some serious details about Sam and Pappy's love connection. They only spoke to each other like four times and each time it was NOT on nice terms. Then suddenly they are desperately in love.And SPOILER ALERT---- why do same and pappy think it's funny that Zoe met the Senator in Greece again at the end??!! Wouldn't they want to tell her immediately? Come on. I'm so mad I actually read the whole thing grrr.Don't waste your time."
1,Dreadful,"This book takes the prize for ""book that I gave up on soonest."" I was listening to it on CD, and never got past the first disk. The first few pages were awful, but I wanted to know what the big secret was with the ex husband. Once Sam and Slick decide to give up everything to follow some strange intruder to an undefined job at an unspecified location, I was done.I'm so glad I didn't spend a penny on this book. It might be the worst book I've ever started reading (or listening to, anyway)."
2,Better For Young Kids,"This book is about a 13 year-old boy, Chris, who's mother died when he was 8. He generally likes to be a loner, and when his father decides they are going to move to Africa, he likes the idea. All goes well until their second plane ride into Tanzania. The plane crashes and Chris' father and the pilot are severely injured. The rest of the book talks about their quest for survival. The Place of the Lions had the potential to be a decent book. It has a great beginning, but once you get to about page 40, it starts going down hill. The book is extremely repetitive about lions attacking and ""Chris' big desiscion"". If the author would've just gotten to the point instead of dwelling on unimportant issues it would've been a lot better. I feel the book is generally geared towards young boys aged 10-12. This book really reminded me of Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen. If you enjoyed that book, I'm sure you will also like this one."
3,Great Graphics....basic game play,"After playing Triple Play last year, I was looking quite forward to MVP this year. The graphics and sound are both really impressive. The gameplay is interesting, but can get boring. The batter can hit up or down or inside/outside, but no movement of the batter him/herself. The pitching is much improved in that you have a zone to target for maximum pitch effectivness except the pitches are highly accurate, and the computer opponent rarely swings at balls outside the strike zone.Overall it is fun to play for a few times but gets boring after awhile (and homeruns are nearly impossible to hit). Wait until they improve it more next year."
5,Great Baseball Game,"I am extremely pleased with EA's new baseball game. I think the graphics are wonderful and the players are very life-like (at least the star players). Also, the new batting and pitching interfaces are cool and add signifant enjoyment to the game. I've always disliked the batter interface in all the other current games. I've craved something more simple and I think it's great that I could try to either pull the ball, go opposite field, pop it up or hit a grounder.I've played last years High Heat on PS2. I enjoyed High Heat, but I like MVP Baseball better. Furthermore, I've played All-Star Baseball on N64, which I did not like at all. So, I'll really happy that I made this choice. Lastly, the announcers (Kruk and Kuip) rule, meat, but maybe I'm only saying that because these guys broadcast SF Giant games."
4,Best Baseball Game Ever!!!,This game is really cool.You can practically do anything that you see in a real baseball game.I also like the pitching meter which is so easy to learn and how the controller vibrates when you are close to pitching a ball.This is to all the people who want to try out this game: rent it first to see if the game is good then buy it right away if you do like it.~Peace Out~
2,A Bit Overrated,"I am an experienced reader of history. Mr. Dallas' work is indeed meticulously documented, but that very meticulosity renders his story line exceedingly difficult to follow. Most of the book attempts to help the reader understand the antecedents of Waterloo through the Congress of Vienna. The account of the Congress was disjointed. Characters were introduced with little context.The description of Waterloo itself seemed to me to be a very short leap preceeded by far too long a run.I just didn't like the book. It did not capture my interest and drag me to the end . . . it was a tough slog."
4,Wish it was longer,"This game is extremely fun, and I could play it over and over. The only problem I have with it is how short the game is. You get to the last map in the blink of an eye, and the game ends very abruptly after the last mission is completed. I feel like the game could have been taken a lot further. Overall, the quality does overcome the quantity, and playing Freedom Fighters will be an enjoyable experience no matter how many times you replay it."
4,Great shooter for beginners,"Freedom Fighters for the X Box is a cool game. The overall concept is well done and interesting. The game play is easy to pick up and figure out.Graphics: Not the best, but they are pretty good.Control: Easy.Fun Factor: Could play it over and over again.Overall: The game is fun and easy to control; however, the game itself is way to easy. It is perfect for new gamers."
5,Red dawn and Freedom Fighters,"I like to think of Freedom Fighters and Red Dawn as the same, unother words I like to think that while New York City is being invaded, the same things are happening in that small town from the movie Red Dawn, as I like to think that the video game and the movie are 100% linked in every way. It's interesting really that it shows you fighting in the wilderness, then in the city. i realy hope they make Freedom Fighters into a movie!"
2,Mediocre,"Heisig's work attempts to summarize the entirety of the three main Kyoto school philosophers. The summaries range from alright to bad. He glosses over terms quickly and doesn't explore any depth nor does he point out points of controversy. Even though these are summaries, they seem fairly vapid. It doesn't help that many of the works discussed are not available in English. The capstone for the book is when he talks about why these philosophers aren't studied much. One can't help but think this is the thing he got most correct. They don't fit into most phil. departments and they don't fit into most East Asian studies departments. This book doesn't seem fit for an intro course nor does it seem fit for a focused seminar. Unfortunately, Heisig's book is forgettable."
2,disappointing,The Fury of Our Maker's Hand was possibly the best heavy metal album EVER! This one? Just a bunch of screaming. Very disappointed.
2,Whatever.....,"Does anyone else think this band is just trying too hard to be accepted by the metal fans of the world? They just seem so forced to me. As far as I'm concerned, all their stuff sounds pretty much the same. Bottom line: I believe they're always going to be a ""wanna-be"" band, trying to show everyone how ""heavy"" they are. Any of you clowns who have been bamboozled by them, here's a hot tip, check out the new Behemoth ""The Apostasy"", or the new Obituary ""Xecutioner's Return"", or for real thrash the new Exodus this fall, or new Testament next March."
5,THE LAST KIND WORDS,ive always liked devildriver but this album blew me away. every song on this cd is a masterpiece. head on to heartache is my favoriye. buy this cd if you already havent LET THEM ROT
5,Looks good,After few first hours of play I can say that this game looks awsome. The back round looks great and so do the cars. I get this game for my son (which is 6) and he treat it like real R\C toy :)
4,nice and fresh view on racing games,"putting RC car in real environment is a fresh and cool idea. good visuals, reasonable controls... nice game but lack of online and poor music makes it 4 instead of 5if you loves Re-Volt, go and buy it!"
4,JE IS BACK (really 4.5 stars),"JE is back on the scene with their 5th album which is their self-titled album. I thought this album is pretty hot. I thought that the songs were well written and arranged real nice. I thought that JE should have had more slow ballads on this one but it is still hot. Standouts are Ghetto Guitar, Watch You (the beat is blazin), Hopefully, Crying out, Good Luck Charm, Seasons Change (w/ John Legend). All in all, I think that this is a good album by JE.... they still have the skills to put a song together with their tight vocals. More ballads would have put this thing on fire even though it is still HOTTTT!!!! ""D"""
2,Standard Jagged Edge,"After a six month delay due to bootlegging and the lead single failure, Jagged Edge returns with their fifth self titled CD. The CD offers more of what JE fans have come to expect which isn't really saying a lot, considering the group has been in the game for ten years now. The production is the same of the majority of the CD and once again those damn twins handle most of the singing. While there are some standout tracks such as Seasons Change, Baby Feel Me and Hopefully, JE is going to need to come harder on CD number six to keep me as a fan."
1,REALLY DISAPPOINTED,"I am a BIG fan of J.E. but this cd never gave you that true J.E. hotness. It just didn't come through. They tried but, IT WAS JUST REALLY BAD! I was DISAPPOINTED! They need to come back with more songs like those on the initial cd. That cd was off the hook! More songs like those!"
3,Great Album,It's too bad that groups like Jagged Edge don't get the commercial appeal of todays sub par artists in mainstream music. Their lyrics and harmonies are outstanding and the depth of emotion in the songs is what I call music today. I love Jagged Edge and will be a devoted fan after this album!
4,Another good R&B album,This is another good JE album. It has a few more up tempo songs (not necessarily party tracks) than ballads. It's good to see them keep R&B music going. Over all if you are a fan of JE and like their other album then you will like this one. I just bought it without reading and reviews or hearing any of the tracks except Lucky Charm and So Amazing. I'm not disappointed at all that I did.
2,Totally Disappointed,I have been anticipating this album for months now and i couldn't be more disappointed. I love Brian and Brandon and respect all of their work but I cant believe they even put this out. Good Luck Charm is the best thing on here. When I heard good luck charm I expected the rest of the album to be just as great but it definetly isn't. Lots of bad production and filler songs. It is gonna take a spectacular and immediete album to make up for this work. Maybe next time guys. I do not reccomend this cd. Maybe the low album sales will smack some reality into them and make them return to their original great music. Love tthem but hate the album.
1,not yet produced,"Unfortunately, this CD lack of a real production work. Its a very uneven record that make difficult to come to conclusions regarding the music. The bunch of song shows the diversity of nica-rock, mostly under the powerful influence of rock-en-español' most known bands (CafetaCuba, Soda Estereo)."
3,"Great clips, but....","This CD had some wonderful clips of the 1968 Tiger season brought to life by Ernie Harwell and Ray Lane. However, the narrated segments between the game clips often had background music that became very overpowering. It was frustrating to try to listen to narration about the season only to have it drowned out by loud, obnoxious ""background"" music. The CD could have done without the music, period. Whoever mixed this CD must have been incompetent. If you can ignore the annoyance of having music overpower the narration and concentrate on the wonderful clips of Harwell and Lane calling some exciting moments and interviewing Tiger players like Bill Freehan, Al Kaline, Jim Northrup and Jim Price, there is a lot to enjoy here."
5,ladybug5169,"My boyfriend is blind, and mentioned to me before Christmas that he would love to find some recordings of old Tiger games. Of course I took my search to Amazon. He absolutely loved The Year of the Tiger '68. I am anxious to see if anything else similar is available for him."
5,Perfect,"A perfect biscuit pan for eight biscuits. Easy to clean, double-walled/insulated - just what I wanted. A very good value and well made."
3,"Too little, too late.","I sincerely expected a lot more. Be aware that, as of 2000, most websites featured in this book either do not exist any longer or have gone under a complete facelift. The CDROM included was quite disappointing: just a directory of the featured sites with a low resolution graphics of their splash page; there is an option to connect to them but the links are mostly outdated. I think the only value of this book is its inspirational content: some of the sites do indeed look great (I wonder about their loading time though) and will inspire some of us to do ""a little more"". This book was probably great 2 years ago; it has little value nowadays."
4,Great Looking Failures,"Iacocca said, ""A man ahead of his times, is broke."" Try and go to these incredible sites and discover the failure rate of cutting edge websites. Great designers none-the-less."
1,Very poor. Don't read.,"This book covers various aspects of dog training and care. But it has many flaws. It was originally written in German and then translated into British English. It has not been adapted to American audiences using American terms (examples: only the one-year rabies vaccination is mentioned, Celsius is used instead of Fahrenheit, id micro chips are referred to as ""name plates""). The information provided only touches on the surface of topics and provides no depth. The book is full of sweeping generalizations. As a result, the book repeatedly presents incorrect information. There are many great dog books on the market, but this isn't one of them."
1,Smelly,"This bear is used and not specified also arrived in a ziplock bag, sorta smells bad. I am disappointed about the smell."
3,Maybe 3.5,"I love a good historical romance. This one is thisclose. It has enough to keep me turning pages. That kept it floating. (that's not a pun) The ship scenes are really good - really. The love scene is good. The opening isn't bad - just lengthy. The sprinking of foreign language is annoying. The whole reason I didn't find it very enjoyable? The experience of reading Ms. Reed didn't feel new or different. Into His Arms felt like something I've read before. And before. And before. And before. It wasn't fresh. It was readable, however. I'll give it that. Will I try the other two in Ms. Reed's trilogy? Maybe."
5,Much better than I expected!,"I didn't really know what to expect from this book. I hadn't heard of James Twyman before, but I was surfing the net during an insomnia-ridden night recently, and stumbled upon references to this book. The more I surfed around for more info, the more intrigued I became. I ended up ordering the book and reading the entire thing in one day (I didn't do anything else that day).I gotta tell ya, the book certainly changed my perspective on life and that's not easy to do.One other review called it ""fluff"" and while I'll admit that it's not heavy and ponderous, I don't think fluff really fits. This book carries an important message, whether it's a true story or not, and I'm afraid that labeling it as fluff will make others think it's not worth reading. Believe me, it IS worth reading."
1,New Insight,"I agree we enter the kingdom of God when we are born again. However, this kingdom is within us and it is not the kingdom where the wolf and lamb lay together and the children lead the wild animals. Also notice that Mt 24:17 & Lk 17:31 talk about the great tribulation and in Mt 24:29-30 Jesus is coming back after the great tribulation. There definitely is an end-time tribulation. By the way if you don't think God still has a plan for the Jews you are mistaken."
1,Too cheap and poor in quality.,"I thought I'd give this one a try as I've had good experiences with other V-Tech products at home. The price seemed very attractive and it is cheap both in price and quality. Can't get a clear sound anywhere and it has a constant ""buzzing"" sound. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS PHONE."
3,Cutest Blisters Ever!,"I love the way they look, but the leather lacing detail KILLED me after 5 hours. Still, they're very cute."
3,"Nice fit, but be aware of the special price for scratched shoes","The shoes are nice fit. I got the special price for a golden/bronze pair. The shoes arrived with its original box but the lining papers inside were completely wrinkled (looks like you roll it into a ball and then stretch it out). The shoes have some scratches on them, don't look like new at all. I guess that's what the special price was, the shoes might be a demo pair or something. But they are cute and comfortable though."
2,My wife says they don't last,"I got these for my wife who listens to AM radio on her portable Sony radio while commuting on the bus and train, 5 days a week. She would run through a ton of regular alkaline AAA batteries so rechargeables made sense.She has a pair of the Energizer's and a pair of Duracell's that are of the same capacity and she says that the Energizer's are terrible and hardly hold a charge. We use a MAHA MH-C401FS charger which charges each battery independently so they don't get overcharged. What else can you say about rechargeables? Either they last long or they don't. These Energizer's DO NOT. We recently got a pair of Sony AAA's and they seem to be even better than the Duracell's."
3,Good enough,"I was pretty happy to get these batteries (I use them in my Turtle beach X32 wireless headphones) and at first they worked great, but it's been about a good three weeks since I've had them now, and after about a combined 6-8 hours of use, they seem to die, I don't really mind that they die so quick since I only use two at a time and I have them charging, but normal batteries last longer then that, just regular everyday AAA's I could get about 4 or 5 days use out of them until they died, but these won't last more then 2 days, just seems like the more you charge them the less they keep, they are fine for a temporary fix, but if you plan on having these batteries for an extended period of time with continuous use, you will be disappointed in it's performance."
1,Before you buy these...,"Of all the rechargeable batteries I have used, and I have used many brands, these are the worst. They are readily available, but they are not worth the money. They will not hold a charge. They will let you down every time. If you buy these, also buy another brand to compare results. Run them in simultaneous applications. Then throw these away."
4,great for me,"After two years of being pleased with my first set of AA energizer rechargeable batteries in my digital camera, I ordered this set AAA for my TV remote.The AA batteries purchased for use with my digital camera being recharged with the 15 min speed charger gave out after 26 months so I ordered another set of AA as well."
2,Not the best,I don't know if it is the charger or the batteries but i haven't had the best of luck with these. I use them in my flashlight at work and i don't more than a week of use. \
4,Exactly what you expect - rechargeable batteries,"Energizer rechargeable batteries last for decent periods of time in kids ""Shake 'em up"" cars, ""Geo Trax"" trains and buildings, computer mice and cordless keyboards. My only knock against them is that they seem to lose their charge while sitting around to be used again. Instead of fully charging them then setting them aside until ready to use, I wait until I need them and charge them over night - an inconvenience when there is a sad child involved! This is true for both the ""AA"" and ""AAA"" sizes."
1,WONT EVEN CHARGE ON AN ENERGIZER CHARGER!!!!!!!!,"i thought these were good because there were 4 batteries and they were cheap. I get the package and open them up. First off, the packaging looked like its been opened before (it was all ripped) and it was crudely bent. I told myself it was just packaging and opened up the box. I grab 2 batteries and place them into my Energizer DUO charger. When i place them in, the green LED on the charger begins to blink, rapidly. This was strange to me because my old batteries never got a blink like this. I then go to look at the manual to see what all the flashing meant. I was surprised to see that it meant one of two things. It meant that either i have non-rechargeable batteries in the charger or the batteries are bad and are defective. I tested every single battery out and i got the same thing. The flashing light. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone unless they are looking for dead rechargeables.Thanks for the waste of $10"
2,underwhelming performance,"Considering these are ""name brand"" batteries, I would have thought they would tend to perform better. I use MAHA smart chargers and these batteries still tend to 'die' (fail to hold a charge) relatively frequently."
1,"DO NOT LAST, DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$","These batteries do not hold a charge much over a 1/2 hour if your lucky, I can't even get them to hold a charge now at all. Save your money avoid Energizer Rechargeable Batteries they don't have a good hold life at all and their life expectancy is extremely short!!!!!"
2,Can be found anywhere for the same price,"Same price as in any local store. Also, they are only 750mh batteries. The higher the amp rating, the more power the batteries can deliver (last longer). While people are still selling 700mh batteries, 750mh is about the lowest you will find. Better batteries can be found online (850-1000mh) for less."
5,Batteries,Great product and a great price. With so many electronic items in the house it is such a savings to buy rechargable batteries and have them ready to go. I have some that are over two years old.
1,Utter crap,"Ok they would be good if they would CHARGEEEE!!!!!!If you are gonna buy these batteries make sure you contact the seller and ask if the batteries arent old or something because it bought mine, tried them on different chargers and nothing.I got angry and threw them away.But other wise if they do work for you the good! Thanks for reading and shop with confidence :)"
1,"M.a.h., important.","The first reviewer is refferring to the mah. I don't know exactly what it stands for, but these batteries have 750. The best have 2500. That's over 3 times the lifetime before needing recharged. Save money with Rechargables by all means, but get good ones if they're the same price.And get a 15 minute charger :)"
2,Two dead after only one year,"I haven't looked into the details but we use a LaCrosse BC-900 charger. After only a couple uses, one cell died. After a year, a second cell failed to work. I've bought no-name rechargeables that have lasted longer. If these are only intended to be used with an Energizer recharger, they should be clearer about it."
2,Much Less Global than Chill,"As a D J who prefers the chill-side of international music, this CD is a halfway decent collection. The only down side for me is too many English-speaking lyrics on as many songs. The resulting emphasis on the CD is much less global than chill."
1,Cheesy Boring Monster Truck Video,"Cheap boring video. Lots of crappy Slo-mo with pointless interviews with some drivers. No Races just the same Hi lights over and over again. Not really any good Hi lights either, just trucks driving around in slomo driving over cars. Its craptastic and IMO its just a waist of 30 mins."
5,Good Product,"Got this shipped free with Prime and came on time. I put it in and it works great, even though the color cartridges were not empty and not replaced at this time. I paid about $10 less than what I would have paid in the store by ordering this and the color cartridges on Amazon and getting them shipped with Prime. Just gotta do your homework and check prices at a few places."
5,Epson color multi-pack Ink Cartridges (060520),I am greatly satisfied with my Epson printer and always satisfied with the ink cartridges sold by Amazon which complement this printer. The color pack is reasonably priced compared to retailers in the area.
1,Would give zero stars if I could,"This was shipped from the Ahlee Store and fufilled by Amazon. According to the product description I was supposed to have received 4 new Epson cartridges in the box from the manufacturer. What I received were 4 dirty loose cartridges taped together! I have no idea if they are expired, refurbished, etc. and there's no way I'm putting them in my printer. Very disappointed and am returning them to Amazon for a refund."
2,Ripped off by Epson!,"Why does one black cartridge cost $20 and three color cartridges cost $33.00? It cost more to manufacture a color ink cartridge than a black cartridge because colored ink costs more to make. But as everybody knows you ain't goin nowhere without it! We are being taken advantage of by this company, college students need to spend more on an ink cartridge than a BOOK!! Please do not patronize this company, for once stick it to the man, so to speak."
3,Good service,"Initially, my order took a long time. I contacted the seller and they sent out a new cartridge. After 3 weeks of waiting, it arrived and I was disappointed. The seller made things right, and I am confident that I will use them again - just not for this product."
5,Printer ink,I only use epson ink for my epson printer. It is the only waterprrof and fully color regulated in for my printer.
3,Expensive!,Ink is just ink no matter who manufactures it. Not price justified. Already switched to ink refills.
5,Epson Black Ink Cartridge,This product is considered by me to be a very high quality product for use in the printer for both letters and photos.
5,Best of the best,"I have been using Epson printers and inks for the last 8 years. As someone who does digital photo restoration, scrapbooking, and crafting, I use my printer almost daily for difficult tasks. The things I like most about the dura brite ink are it's reliable color, it's quick drying, and it's resistance to fading and water. Some people complain about the cost, but you get what you pay for. This is a quality product that will outperform generic inks every time, and when you are talking about scrapbooking your memories or printing photos, you want them to last forever!"
3,roberto,i attempted to return with NO response by Amazon ........... way over priced ... and missrepresented ...... I will never buy this from Amazon again nor trust their pricing!My experience with the Epson printer is that it is incredibly SLOW and eats cartridgesand is very reliable in both qualities
1,Never received the item!,DO NOT buy products from this individual. They will take your money and will not provide the product. I am going to report this seller. I've never had this problem before.
5,Epson To60520,"The ink is great, however I lost my entire purchase price when the cable that moved print head broke shortly after replacing $40.00 worth of Ink. It would cost too much to repair, so I got a replacement. Unfortunately, none of the replacements available used the same ink. Not only that, the new ink is not as good as the old ink and print quality is poorer. Epson though comes out ahead in taking my money!"
1,Didn't last a month! I printed10 pages max!,"I received this cartridge October 11th, printed about ten pages and then it dried out completely!It hasn't even been a full 30 days! It was $20. I stayed away from other ink cartridges that were around $5 thinking they would perform poorly and not last. I guess I was wrong to believe that this was a factory cartridge based on the factory price. In fact , the quality of this product leaves me with doubts about ordering certain things from Amazon altogether. Being able to make a return or even contact them would help a lot. From here on out I guess I will just stick to Staples or Office depot locally and get what I need. Amazon, you need to fix this!!!"
5,Ink Cartridges,"I am very satisfied with my cartridges. However, it took the effort of the distributor's courteous customer service rep. to get them to me. I struggle with deliveries in my rural area and a PO Box is often more secure anyway.My shipment made a round trip without any notification because a local courier chose to simply notate it as ""Undeliverable"". If I had not been tracking it as well as I could, my payment would have been refunded and I would have to start all over again."
5,Epson Color Multi Ink Pack,"Easy transaction, speedy delivery -- just what I needed and all done from home. Happy Customer."
3,So far OK,"Usually, low cost cartridges are less full. they contain less that genuine original ones. Let's wait. It may last as long as another one. These cartridges are perfect, no problem with them so far."
4,Great product but....,"I received the ink, and it was fine-However, the package was opened-I am not sure if this was opened by somebody else in my apartment building, or by the carrier, or whoever, but it was still unnerving-I live in a very safe area, so it seems unlikely someone at my place opened it-Also, the inside ink package was crushed...."
1,"Misleading picture, only 1 black cartridge","The picture of this product is misleading, it seems like there are 4 packs of the cartridge. In fact there is just 1 black cartridge.And I ordered it because I just saw the picture but didn't check the wording carefully."
1,wrong ink,"When I searched Amazon for the the ink I need for my Epson Stylus C120 I did a search for ""Epson Ink 69."" I found the ink and placed the order, but when I received the ink it was the wrong ink (TO60520 instead of TO69520) Now I have no way of knowing how the error happened because by the time I discovered the error it was to late to go back into my browsing history to see the page that I was looking at. I remember ordering the 69 series ink, but all the receipts say TO60520 was ordered. So, I have to assume I made the mistake ... but I just don't know how ... ?!?!?!?"
5,price-price-price,"what can i say, price is king when it comes to ink replacement & you can't beat this price. it's the same ink i pay twice as much for at Office Depot."
4,Epson Color Multi-pack Ink Cartridges,Love to make cards and print things in color - Epson printers are very good - ink cartridges are a little expensive but color is worth it
4,Good ink for the price,"I like my Epson cx3800 printer for its print quality, and this ink makes for excellent text and photos. The electronics which inhibit your ability to refill the cartridges yourself vexes me however, and my next printer will most assuredly not have such anti-consumer components."
1,Junk,These Mis-advertised ink cartridges are junk! Bought 2. the first one starting printing bad half way through. The second was bad out of the box. For the price I paid I thought I was buying new. The photo with the ink was an Epson box. This is false advertising. I have sent the seller an email. No response. STAY AWAY!
2,"If you're not a child, don't bother!","This video was a bitter disappointment. I would go so far as to argue that it qualifies as false advertising! When I bought this video, my head was full of the wonderful Marvin moments I remember from when I was a kid (in the 70's). The ONLY worthwhile cartoon on this collection is 'Duck Dodgers,' a classic. What astounds me is that THE definitive Marvin cartoon ('Where's the kaboom? There was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom!') is NOT on this video!! Instead, they have filled in with NON-Marvin cartoons. To make matters worse, 2 of the Marvin cartoons are the ones made late (late 60s-70s), which I thought were unwatchable when I was 7. Unfortunately, they only get worse with age.(I live in England, but I'm an American, so I grew up on Saturday morning cartoons)"
3,Happy Birthday to you - People's Libration Army !,"As William B Shakespeare wrote in ""Hamlet"":"" To be, or not to be. That is a question:..."" Debute form August 1, 1927, People's Libration Army has been experience and written a glorious history. Long March from 25000 miles is the future of human beings. Not only we conquer everything that we suffered but also we will librate Taiwan, unified into one country. Remeber, Without Chinese Communist Party and PLA then without new China and new age."
3,So So,"Slammin' Sam. What a guy. The book is worth the price and the time but I do wish Mr. Snead had actually written it himself. For instance, it is mentioned several times that he liked to tell off-color jokes. Okay, but how about giving us an example! But no. This is pretty much a book published to make a buck off of a man's name without taking the time and effort to produce something that allows us to understand the man himself. A discussion with Sam about how he practiced and why would have been interesting. However, there are quite a few things that made me smile and the part about Hogan getting ""Player of the Year"" in 1950 when Snead thought he was much more deserving (he was). Sam was honest about many things and I found those tid-bits worth the effort."
3,Nice!,I was expecting more from Deborah Holland on this album. It is just fine. It's a nice piece in my collection but definitely not among the best ones.
3,Text Good; CD Poor,"The text of this book is quite good. The CD is bare bones compared to this series' BCRAN book/CD combination.The CDs sell book. The info can be gotten any number of places. But the CD helps in preparing for the multiple choice test.This CD is bare bones. Many of the questions are direclty lifted from the end of chapter quizes. And the ""exam sim"" has only one mode - test mode of all the possible questions, with no ""instant explanation"" or links to more info.Buy the book for the text, buyer beware of the CD."
2,Wading through the typos,"This book does have a fair coverage of the various topics required for the Cisco exam, but is absolutely riddled with typos, inconsistencies and downright errors. A single thorough editing would have cleared up the vast majority of these problems.I had to augment the book information with other information, including another 640-604 book, web information, etc. before I felt comfortable with the covered material."
3,Average game,"Not that bad but not that great, I admit the story wasn't that bad, same with the voice acting but it's typical and repeative. I can see why some would love this and I can see some hate it but I thought it was ok. It's worth buying at a cheap price (definately not worth $50) because it's worth trying out. I beat the game but I'll never see myself playing it again."
4,no.1 game of the year,"have u ever wanted to blow up someone with a rocket laucher? blast people away with a machine gun? snipe people out with a rifle?this is the game for game for you. with only one man save the world from total soviet dominationp.s. for you moms, there is no blood in this game"
4,Novice Gamer,"Me not being a huge gamer, this is the kinda' game I enjoy. So far it is a difficult game, and I have it on easy. You have to have a strategy to complete stages. The game allows you to send your squad out and help clear an area, not like other games which you have no control of your team members, which just stand there and take fire. I think the game should allow for more weapons to be carried, that's my opinion. Worth the $."
4,Ahh the greatness.,"PLaying this game on twoplayer just to blow your body up with a grenade to see where your body will land is worth it. The games action is great to. I don't play it on 1 player much, but it doesnt matter its worth it if u have a buddy.I traded 6 games for this thing.. and i don't think im much dissapointment. I just don't like the fact there's only THREE levels on two player. Yup. Only 3.But buy this if u want a cheap but awesome game.."
4,Good game but 2 easy,This is overall a fun game but too easy i beat it in 3 hours. Do not buy this or medal of honor rising sun
4,Freedom Fighters 2,Okay I never played the game but am glad to say A SECOND FREEDOM FIGHTER IS GOING TO BE RELEASED LATE 2005 OR EARLY 2006.I dont know anything else but look at it at:www.gamespot.comwww.ign.com
4,This game is absolutly freaking...........AMAZING!!!,"Great job EA!!! This game rocks!! There is only one little thing. It's a little too short. I finished it in about two weeks. It's got a very deep, innovative story with action, and drama placed into an alternate history on the U.S.A. Get out there and buy this game!!!"
4,Revolutionary Game!,"This game was solid and decent. My only gripe was that it was too short, the only reason I gave it four out of five stars. Otherwise I would buy this game or give it some serious consideration. You recruit your army of rebels straight off the street (depending on your charisma level) and you don't necessarily train them. You tell them to either DEFEND, SCOUT, or REGROUP. There's no need to get anymore complicated than that though custom options would've been nice. The people you recruit are pretty smart, if there's an enemy Soviet shooting at them, they seek cover automatically. This game is difficult even on the easy level so there's definitely a challenge factor to it. A nice complimentary game to say SOCOM II! DEFINITE REPLAY VALUE!!"
5,CREATIVIE!!!!!!!!!!,Wow This game is very well thought out when it was made the graphics are elexcent the gameply is excelent and the story keeps u hooked this is one of the most well thought out and created games ever made for the ps2 this is a must have i repeat do not rent this buy this right now and start enjoying one of the best games ever made... ea titles are al good and ea is one of the best game developers in my book. they know how to create a game and how to make it perfect. u can also shoot guys in nyc how awsome is that anywayz if ur looking for to rent this forget it just buy it u wont be dissapointed. this is a must have a a great title for every body who enjoys playing video games
5,Great game,I love this game it is so much fun! I love how you can get up to like fifteen freedom fighters to help you. its just chaos when you get into a battle with a bunch of the russians.
5,Just as i remember it,"I bought this game to replay it, and it was just as much fun as i remembered. If you have never played this game i recommend it."
1,NOT A BOOK OF ARTWORK!,"As someone else pointed out (and I unfortunately didn't read until AFTER I bought the book), the ONLY illustration this book has is on the cover. It's title and description implies it's a compendium of imagery, but it is instead just a bibliography of Bonestell's work. It may be valuable to someone with access to a library of old Collier's magazines, but for all others it's pretty much useless. Granted, Ron Miller's article is great, but I already have the Outre magazines where it was originally published, and at least those HAVE the artwork being discussed!If you're looking for a sampler of Bonestell's artwork, you'd do better to buy the back issues of Outre than this book."
2,not what I expected!,"I was expecting to get pictures in this book... there is none!I was really disapointed!Be careful, this book is only a listing of Chesley Bonestell work! Not any illustration of it!!!But if this is what you are looking for, it seems to be very well done and complete"
4,A word about sizes...,"Both products are 5 star winners on their own...But BE AWARE that the tripod DOES NOT fit in the case. However, they are still a great buy for the money."
5,Spankin deal,"I am blown away by the deal I got with these two items. Both are quality for a reasonble price. I am especially enamored with my camera case, and several of my friends have also purchased one like mine after seeing how positively cool this case is.The tripod is good enough construction for someone who needs an occasional tripod, but probably not adequate for full time use. I am happy with it for my own needs."
1,piece of rubbish,"I too found a marked decline in signal strength in all three of our networked computers after installing the antenna to an airport extreme base station. The installation instructions are pathetic, illustrations unclear, tech support hopeless (after dialling tech support, you are given a new number to call....which turns out to be the same number you are calling in the first place!). Finally, the typographical errors (eg, airport extrem) written on the boxing material further suggests something is amiss with this product/company."
1,Worse Than Nothing,"Before connecting this antenna I used AP grapher to monitor the signal strength of my AirPort Extreme. I cut power to the AirPort, connected the antenna, and powered up the Airport. Signal strength measured from both of my computers went down. Also, the product description states that the antenna connects directly to the airport. It does not. The antenna has an SMA connector and has be connected using an SMA-to-MCX pigtail."
4,Iron Butt Riders Look here,"If you're a LRR (Long Range Rider) then this is a must read for the motorcyclist. Fair warning, long distance riding is for a group of hard core riders, no matter what marque of machine you are on - but this is a great story. I can just imagine the special forces types getting a real kick out of this one. Just read it - then go prepare your machine - see ya in Outback Australia - or South Dakota."
4,Great Insight,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It provided insight into the world of high mileage riding. It was interesting to read about the different strategies people use when approaching the Iron Butt Rally. Ayres was a first time competitor in the IBR, but managed to do very well. I was amazed at how far he was willing to push himself to complete the rally with such a high standing.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys motorcyles or long distance riding."
3,Cool book,I know (and ride with) a couple of IBR guys and this book reads like a whos who of IBR participants. Great book.
3,"Nice anecdotes, pretty lousy writing","The charm of Ayres' book is definitely not his writing style; rather, it's the stories he includes from other Iron Butt Rally Riders, such as Eddie James, Ardys Kellerman, and others. Ayres is, without a doubt, one of the best endurance riders on the planet; however, in my modest opinion, it seems to me that his contribution to the book is pretty much ""I did this, then I did that, and now here's a word from another rider,"" and those words are invariably more interesting than his text. I would love to have someone like Fritz Lang or Adam Wolkoff write a book about their Ironbutt Experiences, for they would surely be a supremely entertaining read.This book is much more entertaining if one knows the players involved; for someone outside the endurance riding community, it may be a fairly dull read. Ayres has written at least one other book, but my advice is this: Ron, keep your butt in the saddle and away from the word processor."
5,Need more readers like this,"Cynthia Rylant continues to create memorable stories and characters that resonate with children. The High-Rise Private Eyes series is a spoof on the classic hard-boiled detective stories of the 1920s through 1940s. Jack and Bunny are actually partners in this story though, as compared to the dective/secretary role in the classics. Their partnership is more reminiscent of a brother-sister relationship though, and readers will enjoy the playful exchanges they have with one another. An added plus to the story was the fine use of logic used in the denoument. There are currently 8 books in this series, but there can never be too many stories with Jack and Bunny."
5,"I rented, and I NEED $40!!!","OH MY (...) GOD! I STOLE Tenchu 2: Birth of Stealth Assassains from my friend and I swear I practically worshiped that game. But this. This is like, heaven here. The graphics are really good. You get to go through castles, caverns, towns, and best of all, you get to...you get to...CUT OFF PEOPLE'S BODY PARTS!!!! AHHHH THIS IS SO COOL! I garuntee you people, if you get this game, you'll have a very fun week/end"
2,Not a Very Good Stealth Game,"I played this right after I played Splinter Cell. For those of you that played Splinter Cell, you know that Splinter Cell is a near perfect stealth game. But Tenchu is just a dumbed down stealth game in comparison.First of all, the point of the game is to get stealth kills. I didn't like that aspect at all. The point of being a ninja is to go through the mission undetected without leaving traces. But you're just jumping around and leaving bodies everywhere.Also, the AI is stupid. I'm so used to Splinter Cell where the enemies can hear you sneak up behind them if you're not careful. But here you don't have to stalk. You just run up and kill them. They also give up too easily. You can hide behind a tree and they'll get stumped.Finally the camera is horrible. It is very hard to actually sneak if you can't monitor the enemy because the camera is being retarded. I think this game might be a little more fun if the camera work was better."
4,Best [] Played Thoroughly,"I enjoyed the original Tenchu games for the PSX, mostly due to the fact that ninjas are the coolest thing ever! ""Tenchu 3:Wrath of Heaven"" continues the story of Rikimaru and Ayame, lord Gohda's principle assassin's. The story, to be perfectly honest, is not the reason that you will really wanted to play the game. I just wanted to enjoy the gratifying feeling of sneaking around and slicing enemy guards throats.I found Tenchu to be a breath of fresh air in a time were there is simply too much attention on games like GTA and Metal Gear. Those are both great series of games, but they just don't feel the same to me. I am an RPG gamer, this world of demons, ninjas and stealth just feels right to me.The game is very fun, will definately keep you glued to the television for a while..."
1,What a Complete Joke!,"I'm flabbergasted for two reasons:First, how did Activision manage to make a PS2 sequel to a PS1 game that's actually WORSE than the original?? It defies logic! This game has the absolute WORST CAMERA ANGLES OF ALL-TIME!!! To top it off, the character movement and combat is ""wooden"" at best. I have better games on my friggin cell phone.Second, how in the LL Cool J did so many Amazon users give this a good review?? Argh!You'd be better off playing PS1 'Tenchu: Stealth Assassin' again than wasting your time on this stinker. Seriously.ADDED:Playing Wrath of Heaven is like playing the unfinished test-version of Stealth Assasin."
5,Best Stealth game out there!,"This game is just awesome; any one who says otherwise doesn't know how to use the buttons on the controller. The fight system is a major improvement over the other two it leaves a far smaller window for attacking the enemy. This game is also easy enough for the casual gamer yet challenging enough for the more intense gamers.I aseptically like versus mode on the multi-player game, although I really miss the mission builder form Tenchu 2. This game does lack story dialogue and is way darker (theme) than Tenchu 2.This game is why I bought a PS2!"
3,"Great graphics, just a little too repetitive",When i first got this game i was astounded at the goodness and killing abitlities of these ninga assasins. As you progress the game gets harder and harder. After a while you get bored and the game gets stale.
2,Could have been great!,"Good graphics, great concept, great story, immersive gameplay - ALL of this completely ruined by terrible, uncontrolable camera angles. To me it wasn't worth the 5 dollars I paid for it on eBay. All they had to do was fix the camera...unbelievable."
4,Every Step Closer,"Tenchu is basically the only video game based off a ninja that actually plays similar to an actual ""mythical"" ninja.Pros: Fun stealth, various weapons and distractions to use against the enemy, 3 characters to choose from with own stories, multiple ways to complete levels bringing high replayability, 2 player co-op mode, etc.Cons: No personal mapmaking levels, 2 player co-op needs tweaking (better than none though), camera angles also need tweaking (but what 3D game doesn't)? Not replica of historical ninjas, (but than again, this is a mythical fiction story so we can all go with the flow. Plus it's closer than any other game to make one feel like a ninja).This is the 3rd installment in the series and it hasn't taken a step back or seem like a complete rehash of the previous two. The ability to try multiple ways to complete each level makes it rare towards replayability. Enjoy."
2,some thing is wrong,"i love stealth action adventure games.but this game is not as no far from as addictive asMGS2 so i asked my self why?the fact that it did not have a built in RADARquite annoying. yes it didnt have radar i don't know if iget or earn such item but i started pretty rough.no radar ? splinter cell ,mgs2? imagine that.i wont recomend it to single players but dual player mightenjoy the game."
4,terrible,This game is hardly as good as its counterparts Tenchu 1 and 2. The camera angles are terrible. I've played the demo and this games graphics are as bad as on PS1. The fighting is hard and you are terrible outmatched against a boss. the only way to kill a guy are stealth kills but if you get found out and you against regular guys you will get your but kicked making you a relatively weak fighter. Definately don't buy this or even rent it. its a waster of time and money.
4,GREAT FIRST GUITAR!,"wow. i loved this thing. i got it about september of 2007 as a first guitar. i got it for only 74.99 and the thing came to me perfect, no dings, no scratches and all the accesories. it sounded great once i plugged it in. But it's not a big-brand name guitar,you will last say, a year before youll want a gibson or a fender. A perfect time to improve your skills for a better guitar. But i still play it all the time, even after getting a better guitar. its amazing, and sounds just like a fender. this purchase was a real nice bargain. But remember, its for beginners."
4,Walking in Thought,"This wonderful book consideres the civic street from many perspecitives and describes it with poetic attention. The author has spent days on these great streets and brings careful measurement and observation to his carefully crafted text. If everyone planning streets and highways in America read this book and visited one of two of these great streets, it would enable a huge improvement.This book studies the street not from the simple American perspecitve of high velocity traffic sewar, but from the realities of a place to hang out. eat lunch, shop, socialize, people watch, court, celebrate and be. The read how these places work in this book is to realize how much our desperate focus on the automobile costs us.Buy this book and photocopy some of its illustrations for your next public hearing on town planning."
4,Great!,"I love this book! The drawings are amazing and they really help backup what the author is saying, regarding density and proportion of streets."
1,Disenchanted,"Katia comes across as a very needy, possessive, weak person. She gives the impression she raises her daughter when in reality her parents raised Daria. I can't believe Katia would relate in a children's book that she wanted to abort her daughter. She appears to see children as a burden. I'm disappointed."
2,disappointed CD,"I bought this CD for one song (Mercado) and it turned out that one was the only one I enjoyed. Well, music is very subjective but I was disappointed."
5,excellent latin jazz,"One of the most exciting latin jazz disc that I listen in this year, great arrangements, first quality musicians, greats percussion solos, completely a latin feeling"

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AUTHORS WRITINGS!!!! HE CAN DO NO WRONG!!! THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK WAS VERY SELFISH, AND CONNIVING!!!!!! ONE OF MY TOP 5 FAVORITES!!!! EXCELLENT JOB AS USUAL!!!!"
4,warning!!,"warning! this is not a country album! ilse delange is developing her music towards real pop music. however, if you like ""world of hurt"" this album will not be a great shock. i still think ""world of hurt"" is her best, but this one comes second with a star! try the song ""heavenless"" and die!again with a totally international band, her dutch boyfriend, liveband member and drummer, is not even on it! so is none of her dutch touring band.and the quality of the instruments is very high.buy it!"
3,White Hot is really luke warm,"This is not one of Sandra Brown's better works and I have read all of her books. Female protaganist lacked depth, hero was boring. The climax was a huge disappointment. Even for fiction, believablity was a stretch."
1,Badly Written Book,"I read Sandra Brown's, ""Envy"" within a couple days. I remember I couldn't put that particular book down. But, ""White Hot"" is a whole different story.This book is absurdly stupid!!! I can't remember one thing from the book. I actually had to force myself to finish reading it. And, in order to do that, I went to Borders and sat there to finish it. That's the only way I could get through this, sorry and meaningless piece of fiction.Who is telling some of these authors that their stories are good??? Now, I don't know if I ever want to take a risk of reading another Sanda Brown book, because ""White Hot"" was a disastrous and dull-witted novel!!!"
2,I hated this book!,"Every character was extremely unlikeable. I thought the two main characters deserved each other. She was a [prostitute] and he was a slimeball. Of course, there's is an odd denouement in the last chapters that is supposed to make it okay for him to be the hero but it was unrealistic and totally stupid.This whole book left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Dull and hard to finish,"While I love Sandra Brown's writing, this book fell short by a long shot. I couldn't like any of the characters and just wanted the book to be finished. I even considered skipping a few pages towards the end to get it back to the library on time. It's sad to think a SB book took me almost 14 days to read. Better luck next time!"
2,whats going on here?,"I""m really surprised that people gave this book so many stars! I have been a Sandra Brown fan from the beginning and I love her books and look forward to each one. The last book I really loved was ""Envy"" and it seems that every book after lacked a little something. This book was slow and none of the characters did anything for me. I felt no reaction good or bad towards any of them. I felt this wasn't what I have come to expect of her books. I usually finish her books in one sitting because I cant put them down...I struggled to get through this book."
2,Not Her Best,"I've read alot of Sandra Brown and this one literally put me to sleep. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I should have listened to my instincts and just stopped reading it when I couldn't get into it by page 100, but my Mom said it was so good that she couldn't put it down. It seems a lot of her recent work doesn't live up to her earlier works such as Witness. I was very disappointed, and I hate the new premium paperback, it's too big and heavy, probably just another way to make a few more dollars."
3,Medium Hot,"I was waiting for a mind blower from Brown. Instead, it's very average, no real excitement, & somewhat repititious. If I had to listen to Huff blow up one more time, I was going to jump off a cliff.The ending was exciting though, & the guy got the girl !M.M.S."
2,"Dull, dull, dull.","For an author that wrote Envy, The Alibi and Witness, I am surprised when I pick up one of her books and it's sooooo dull. Like White Hot. I had a hard time finishing all 579 pages and think the whole of the story could have been summed up in maybe 300 instead. I wasn't impressed with any of the characters, the dialogue got to be monotonous and I think the editor failed when he/she didn't chop about 2/3 of it. The surprising twist wasn't surprising because had Beck honestly represented what it appeared he did until the last 5 pages, Sayre and him wouldn't have ended up together and we knew that was a sure thing before I began reading it. Sorry, this one was a flop."
2,Not nearly as good as Envy,"I read envy a couple years ago, after my best friend said it was good. I loved it. I liked it so much I even bought her next book in hardcover. The Crush. That book was just ok. So when i saw this one, i remembered how much I liked Envy. Figured The Crush might have just been a fluke. This book was pretty boring. It went on and on and on, and it was too long. Some of it was interesting, and the end was good. But the middle of the book was pretty much pointless. I enjoyed her characters, just thought it could have been shortened by a lot. I just bought one more Sandra Brown book and if she doesn't pick up with another good one, she goes on my list of one hit wonders."
3,It was OK. Not great. Not horrible,"**Potential spoilers**A co-worker lent me this book and told me it was ""soooo goooood."" Well, I've read it and it's ""OK."" Nothing to rant and rave about but nothing I'd set fire to either.An interesting story with a lot of fillers. Couldn't stand the main character, Sayre, at all. There was absolutely nothing endearing about her and I didn't buy the romantic angle at all. I liked Beck and I loved Huff. Huff was supposed to be the villain but I thought he was cool as heck. The rest were neither here nor there.I'll have to admit I was rather shocked by the twist at the end and that alone made it a worthwhile read for me.Recommended to those who just want an average book to pass the time."
2,Disappointing,"I got this audiobook and was very disappointed. I had just finished Brown's book Envy (which, I highly recommend) and was looking forward to another enjoyable book. The characters were not interesting and the book barely kept my attention to finish. If you're looking for a good mystery novel then I recommend to keep looking."
4,Entertaining,"The characters in White Hot reminded me of a modern day Tennessee Williams dysfunctional southern family. You could almost see Big Daddy mopping his brow in the summer heat. The daughter, Sayre who left ten years ago, making a complete break from the family she unfortunately was born into must return when younger brother allegedly commits suicide. His death looks suspcious and that's when things heat up. Unfortunately the romance portion of the novel never got as steamy as I would have liked, but all in all this was a good read."
4,One of the better novels,"A very engaging story. Invokes the anger in you for Huf Hoyle for playing the almighty and being completely self absorbed and selfish.Sayre's character is well defined and she is likeable through out. Finally figures out instead of running away , facing problems head on is the way to go.It is well written , one of the better Sandra Brown novels.I would also recommend Low Pressure"
2,Couldn't believe this was Sandra Brown,"Sandra Brown is one of my ""go to"" authors for a beach or airplane read. Until White Hot all of her books were reliable page turners in interesting settings.This is the first book of hers where every character was despicable except a former high school quarterback who is in a minor role. The heroine's actions were not credible given her description. The revelation regarding another main character came too late to be satisfying unless one read the entire book again to see where things might have been interpreted differently. Who has time for that?!If you like Sandra Brown skip this one."
4,Twist to the end??,"I just finished this book, and I was surprised with the outcome. It got a little slow for me in parts, but like all of Sandra Browns book I enjoyed it."
4,Better than her last one,"After ""Hello, Darkness"", I was a little worried. I thought that book was very dismal and I was afraid Sandra Brown was starting to lose her talent for writing great romantic mysteries. But I'm happy to report that it was the old Ms. Brown in this book. I still don't think it was her very best work but I was definitely hooked. I was completely surprised by the ending - a great twist. But of course, for all of us that say this was a terrific book, there are those out there who have the exact opposite opinion. You'll just have to read it for yourself."
1,Not Good,"I don't think there's ever been as unlikable a heroine as Sayre in any Sandra Brown book. The woman hates her family and cuts all ties with them, yet she suddenly throws herself into bringing them down on her return to town 10 years later? If you hate them, cut them out of your life and keep it that way -- don't go overboard sticking your nose into every aspect of their lives trying to stir up trouble. It made me dislike her even more. She was spoiled, selfish, arrogant, snobby and someone you couldn't care about in the least. Even when I found out her ""secret,"" I felt nothing, other than wishing she'd run her convertible off a cliff somewhere.The other characters weren't any better, save for Beck. However, all I could think of throughout the book was why on earth this man would want anything to do with a chick like that. Her ""Beige Marilyn"" pedicure must've been something else.All in all, don't waste your time or money. Very disappointing to see Sandra Brown put out such a complete flop."
5,Very enjoyable book!,"Intricate story of power, greed and murder in a small industrial Louisiana town. A great story interwoven bits and pieces that keep it moving along at a good pace. Very enjoyable. Might make a good movie."
1,He's a racist and he just sucks.,"Bought it by accident. He's a cheater. He's a racist and he just sucks. His singing is LOUSY. I don't have 20 words - no, wait: don't by this trash."
4,"Typical Evanovich, very funny","I look forward to each of her new books. Her character's are so entertaining, yet recognizable. Love her books and can't wait to see what they get into."
4,New Characters to Love,"How quickly can Janet Evanovich make you fall in love with characters you haven't met? I'd say about 2 chapters, give or take a page. It's easy to become comfortable with Evanovich's mainstay, the Stephanie Plum series, and those characters that we adore, but her earlier work is equally compelling. Her characters are fun and funny, the situations are outrageous and all the better for it, and the one-liners will keep you cackling.This was a real page-turner and I laughed out loud quite a few times; I didn't even mind the speed-dating style to the romance!"
5,IT WAS EXCELLENT,"i ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH,I THINK SHE IS ONE HELL ON A WRITER,I READ ALL HER BOOKS AND WAITING FOR MORE."
4,"Not Stephanie Plum, but still good","I LOVE the Stephanie Plum series. In all honesty, can anyone expect that to be topped? This is not as good as a Stephanie Plum book, but it is still good.Daisy is nothing if she is not relentless. She is finishing her PhD, raising her brother, helping kids by being a crossing guard, working at a nursing home, working at a radio station, and being the ""famous"" author of a recipe book for dogs. It is at the radio station that she falls in love with Steve, her boss. He is determined to match her tenancity and win her heart.There are mishaps, crazy characters, and awkwardness. Daisy remains the hero throughout the book regardless of her lack of grace. Of course, she has a wacky sidekick.I admit I was a bit disappointed, as this was the first non-Stephanie Plum book I have read of Janet Evanovich. However, she set the bar really high with that series, and this is an enjoyable book."
4,Enjoyable,"I am a huge fan of Janet Evanovich, and I have yet to read anything she's written that I haven't enjoyed. That being said, ""The Rocky Road to Romance"" is a step below her hilarious Stephanie Plum series.There is plenty of humor, but Ms. Evanovich doesn't devote enough time to creating the characters and their little quirks fully enough to endear them to the reader. While charming and entertaining, I feel the story was somewhat rushed - or more accurately, the relationship between Steve and Daisy. I would have liked to see it cultivate at a slower pace.For a lighthearted and fun read, though, this book is a perfect choice."
4,Janet has a knack for these books!,"Thumbs up for this one..Daisy and Steve have a rocky road to travel, but somehow manage, despite an old lady, a huge dog and a teenage brother. Can't wait for her next one!"
4,A Great Quick Read Anyone Can Enjoy!,"My boyfriend purchased this book for me so I would have something to read for a little weekend getaway. I had been very interested in reading the series of (10) books Envanovich has but when I received this one I figured what a better way to see if I like her writing style.The Rocky Road to Romance was a fun and quick read, unlike many books I have read who take 150 pages to explain what Evanovich writes in 50. That's not to say she is skimping out on anything, the book was fabulous and I wish it didn't end.I agree with the other reviews where if you want to get away/ or take a break from the other ""meatier"" books, this is the book to do it with!ENJOY!!!"
4,actually a 3.5 rating,It was a good read thou not a great read. Liked the hero and the heroines teen-age brother and little above luke warm for the heroine (to naive) the bodyguard was a real hoot thou.Not sure yet if this book is a keeper or not - thou I really enjoyed Evanovichs Naughty Neighbors. Maybe I'm spoiled by JC's books.
2,Evanovich has written much much better,"Daisy is a grad student with far too many balls in the air (and jobs for that matter). One of her many jobs is working at a radio station, and she asks for the traffic spot, only to unwittingly become the object of obsession by a mobster after foiling a crime. She also gains the attentions of her sexy boss Steve, who decides that she needs to be protected.Amateur mobsters, a gun-toting granny, and antics galore cannot save this dated and predicatable retread, that could have done with some updating for its re-release. It's hard to believe that Evanovich even wrote this, as it contains some of the cheesiest dialogue ever - definitely pre-Plum."
4,Evanovich Style and Class... or Sass?,"You can see Evanovich was bursting with talent before she even created Stephanie Plum! I can definately see how these aren't the typical ""romance novels"" but they're just as sexy. Evanovich provides an excellent plot that is always very funny. Her characters are the best! Way to go! Must read anything written by Janet Evanovich!"
3,A Fun Old Favorite By A Very Talented Author!,"This is one of the older titles that the very talented Ms. Evanovich penned back in the late '80's early '90's. It showcases the incredible talent that she had in the making and has lived up to with her more recent stories.Daisy and Steve are great characters and oh...we can't forget Bob the dog. Two more mis-matched people could not be found, yet they still manage to find common ground and develope a great relationship. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and the romance between Steve and Daisy is fun. If you are a fan to Ms. Evanovich and have not yet reader her earlier works I seriously recommend that you pick up this one. It is not only a fast and entertaining read, but it is also fun. This is a great way to spend a few hours. What is better then laughing while falling in love?Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
3,"Quick, Easy, Entertaining Read, But Pretty Much Formula Writing","I love Janet Evanovich's writing style and her keen ability to create humorous characters and engaging dialogue. Clearly, ""The Rocky Road to Romance"" was pre-Stephanie Plum period and the characters and dialogue are not nearly as developed. However, for a quick, mindless read for pure escapism, it definitely delivers."
4,A well written text.,"I have been using Demar's Standard Textbook of Electricity for the past five years. This book is our primary text for the first three months of a 10 month, 5 days per week, 7 hours per day Industrial Electricity Course. Student feedback is uniformly positive."
5,THE Maintenance Electrician's Bible,"Extremely important to have this book for the Electrical Maintenance student, Apprentise, or Journeyman. This book is truely the ""backbone"" of critical information used by all electricians! When you know your ""Delmar"", you will have gained an invaluable amount of knowledge and confidence in your work."
5,"Review for the purchase of Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity, 3E",The textbook that I purchased was exactly what I needed for my class. It was in PERFECT condition and I got it quickly. The purchase process was very easy and and the book was delivered as I had anticipated. Thanks!
1,Very Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, based on its premise, and the other reviews. I hoped it would expand and enlighten my own unarticulated thoughts on the human animal, and its disconnect from the natural world. I was so disappointed that the book, in my opinion, failed to really explore and run with this large and very important issue. I found the writing difficult, and it often seemed that Livingston was writing for an academic journal, and was mainly interested in discussing and rebutting esoteric points with his fellow ecologists, rather than exploring a larger and broader view of his subject for the general audience to whom the book was intended. I found the book tedious and repetitive, and a chore to read. The infrequent moments when the author did actually write clearly about his larger theme of humans as a species cut off from nature tended to be sarcastic quips against society, which I thought diminished the points he was trying to make."
1,Falling Apart,"I bought a pair of Justin boots approximately six months ago, although not worn that frequently, the seams joining the front halves of the uppers to the rear are coming apart. Only the pull-on strap stitching is keeping the boots from falling completely apart. Not a very good product and contact with the manufacturer amounted to a ""go away boy, don't bother us"" response."
1,Shoe sole falling apart,"after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart. Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose. I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years(same type of ropers - different colors). I have never had a defective boot like this. I called and e-mailed papa shoe, They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture. If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers, They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me. I called Justin, They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response. I will not buy from Papa Shoe again."
4,Great Boots - Comfortable - Wide Sizes,Great boots. I needed a pair for when I ride my motorcycle. They are very comfortable and come in wide sizes!! I have a wide foot and I have trouble finding shoes. I would certainly buy another pair from this vendor. The boots arrived the next day!! Very quick service!
1,Justin Roper,"First I have a pair of these boots and they are great. The issue is with the provider. The leather was damaged. I was very disappointed that someone didn't check the boots more closely before shipping, especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift. It tied up a $114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots. I understand that things can be damaged, but especially during Christmas, shippers should check things before shipping."
1,Warning,"I can get why the pair I bought are branded Made in China. They are not made of leather, also are not made with the quality expected from a brand as Justin. This Basic's are BS, nothing else"
4,Works great! Instructions need to be re-written,"This works much better than a FM Modulator, which I was using before. The directions are unclear and if it wasn't for looking on these reviews, I wouldn't have figured out how to switch to the input on the stereo. The directions mention using the cd/aux to switch to the input for this device. However, if you have a 2004 Trailblazer or vehicle with a similar configuration, you have to press the ""Band"" input to get to this aux input. You actually have to press it 4 times (FM1,FM2,AM, then AUX1). This should have been stated in the directions. If I hadn't read another reviewer on here that wrote something similar, I would have thought it was defective and returned it. If you have problems taking out your stereo to get to the connections in back there are plenty of sources online for instructions on that and even videos if you have a common vehicle."
5,Easy and Works - what else do you want?,"I cam really close to replacing the factory radio in my 2005 GMC Yukon mostly because it did not have an Aux in. This thing saved me time and money. My GMC does not have satellite radio or a CD changer but does have OnStar and it worked perfectly. The dash was easy to pull out, I plugged the GM12-AUXV2 into the back of the stock radio, drilled a little hole in one of the cubbies for the cable and nice sound. No engine wine, just nice clear sound. To get to my phone, I simply press the BAND button on the radio and now it toggles between FM1/FM2/AM/AUX and the OnStar still works. One hint, I used the3M Scotchlok T-Tap Nylon Insulated Self-Stripping Female QuickSlide 953X Disconnect 12-10 AWG (Yellow) - 100 Piecesto attach the power and ground leads from the cables going to the radio.Get this thing, you will love it."
3,Better than the alternatives,"We wanted an Ipod input to our '04 Impala car radio, and since the radio can't be replaced easily, this fits the bill. Hookup required a bit of dashboard disassembly, but with the internet, directions for most cars are out there. Only gripe is that there isn't an input level control; we have to crank up the output on the Ipod to get it to the same level as the FM radio. Overall, works about a million times better than any of the many FM couplers we've tried."
4,Broken? Here's how to fix your module.,"I love it! When it works. This module worked great in my 03 Cavalier for about two years.I was very frustrated when it developed a loud popping noise in the left channel. I feel like, especially considering the price, that this auxiliary input should work longer than two years. Well, i figured out how to fix them. I made this video describing how to fix these things if the left or right channel develops problems or if the unit won't power on. Maybe it'll save you a few dollars. You're welcome ; )[...]"
4,FreeBSD from Linux user point of view,Installed and configured FreeBSD for the first time using this book. Very nice and easy to follow. Information goes far enough to allow the user/reader to take things further where needed - from other sources. The book covers the basics nicely. I came from linux and found the change over to be smooth. Nothing bad to say.
1,This book was *written* in 24 Hours,"It's not completely useless, I learned a lot from the book but to have so many typos and mistakes in technical reading such as this is completely unacceptable. It includes a CD with FreeBSD 4.7 which is still supported but out of date."
1,Not what I Hoped it would be,"The book was just some more problems just like the example problems in the actual book. Didn't work at all as a study guide, a study guide usually shows you the answers as well. Wasn't happy with it, so I returned it."
3,College Book....,"Considering this was my first graduate course, I will give this book a decent review. It did help refresh my memory for the class. Great price and Amazon was prompt with the shipment."
5,great price,This was a brand new book for a great price almost half what I would have paid in the college bookstore. I received it in 2 days which was awesome.
1,very upset,This was the wrong book so I had to return this because it was the workbook and not the text. I ordered the text and due to an inventory miss count there was not a book available. I recieved an e-mail telling me that as of Jan 24 the amount has been credited back. Well it is not Feb. 19 and the amount still has not been credited back to my account. I have spoken to the accounting dept. and I was told to contact my bank. Well my back called to explain that the credit was not in the account. They were told that it would take about 10 days. Once again the money still is not in my account. I have enjoyed your buisness but if your in the buisness to take money right awya for a service that was never given and then make it very difficult to refund. I would like for you to help me with this issue so that I can feel comfortable that you are not out to rip my off and take my money. This is bad buisness.
1,Do NOT buy from this seller!,"I never even received my book, what a freakin rip! I sent the seller an email and they never responded, thanks for nothing."
4,performs exactly as advertised,I purchased this bike stand to help declutter the garage and keep the bicycle from falling over. It works perfectly and fits in a compact space. It works well with either front or rear bike tire. A bit pricey but a very nice product.
5,"Great, but overpriced on Amazon","This is the best bike stand out there. Very sturdy, and no worries about the spokes of your wheel resting on the stand like with the other smaller stands sold here. BUT!!!!!!!!!!! This thing is very overpriced on Amazon, not sure why. After searching around the web I was able to find it for $35 shipped to my door. Check out Outside Outfitters on the web. Save yourself some money!"
5,Works Great,Mountain bike and road bike's spokes don't lean against the stand like other bike stands. Keeps the bike up straight.
5,A simple but well made Rack,"It is only two peices and slides together in seconds. Holds the bike upright without damage to spokes or frame. For hubby's Tri-bike with narrow wheels we had to put a couple of short peices of plumbing pipe insulation near the top to make the opening tighter and hold the bike upright. No big deal. Anyway, Just ordered another for packing in the suitcase and traveling to events."
1,Horribly machined product,So there was some assemble required. No big deal. the problem was that one of the screw holes was too big and the screw would not even thread into to hole. It simply just fell out. Then one of the holes was too small. The provided screw would not even fit in. As a result the stand is unstable and wobbly. So two out of eight screw holes are non-usable.
1,Price is tripled!,"I have this stand and I love it. I paid $27 for it however. If you search for this, you will see the MSRP is $35 and it sells for less than that all over the net. What is with this pricing?!"
5,"She is a breathtaking person, and her music follows suit.","I have known Leslie for many years and witnessed her amazing metamorphosis, as she ventured again into the music world. Her timidity added a softness, sweetness and sincerity that has made her music unusually real--truly spoken from the heart. Her person is genuinely reflected in her music. Don't miss out on this extraordinary opportunity to be privy to something so beautiful."
3,"Heavy on the Koufax, but still good","Found it to be a little to Koufax-centric, but that doesn't retract from the overall excellence of this video. Well edited too."
1,Jews in baseball?,Now that they own the banks and wall street firms as well as control the movie-making business they're claiming an interest in baseball. Teach the Germans. We gentiles know baseball.
2,"Good No. 80, the rest mediocre","I was mildly shocked to see the previous reviewers higher ratings. This CD, in my humble opinion, only has one good performance, No. 80. No. 81, one of Haydn's most underrated symphonies, has only about half the energy it really needs to be effective. Back in the LP days, Antal Dorati recorded this symphony with a London pickup orchestra for Mercury. It is one of the greatest Haydn recordings ever made. The energy of that performance had NASCAR written all over it and he takes all of the repeats. For some reason, it has never been reissued on CD. A real trajedy. As for 99, it is very dull, the weakest performance of the three."
1,Extremely dissapointing!,"I expected demonstrations, experiments, animations. And what did I get? People sitting and talking! What's the point in making a video, if you don't use the capabilities of this medium? If I want equations and problems, I take a textbook. This video is nothing more than a (very superficial) textbook which is read aloud. And that goes for both parts."
5,For Dummies Style Genius,"This is a great tool for those who would like an introduction to a tough subject. The pace is faster than I might have liked, but hey thats why I bought the DVD player. I learned at my pace and look forward to buying more. This program is perfect for the beginner or as a review for a college class."

3,Abit drawn out,"I showed this, and lectured from it, to my 8th grade classes.The concepts presented were fine. They were of course juvenile, so my students enjoyed them, but when it came time for the math portion, they were lost.It wasn't that the math was that difficult, it's just that this program beat it to death, drug it outside and beat it again. Even I just wanted it to end and had to keep encouraging my kids to hang in there."
5,Step by Step instructions on how to start your own business at home,"This book got me up and running in a very short time. It was easy to set up my business of selling recipes and books from my home as I followed along the instructions. In clear, concise language, it spells out the steps you need to do including giving you examples of ads. Not a lot of pages, but each page is packed with straightforward instructions; all you have to do is follow along and you're in business."
3,Never Quite Soars...,"Violinist Kaila Flexer leads an acoustic quartet comprising another violin plus acoustic bass and percussion through a set of energetic music that often takes off but never quite soars. I suspect that this is a group that sounds better live than in the studio, where things seem just a little too studious to be as spontaneous as I believe they probably can be. Still, in a world in which mediocre recordings by folks such as the Moody Blues, Queen, and the Beach Boys--and don't even get me started on ""bachelor pad music!""--can be sold for $30 per gold CD, when the original LPs were already a ripoff at the $5 or so they originally sold for, surely a genuine musician such as Kaila Flexer deserves to sell a few CDs, so I am passing along a sincere but not quite enthusiastic recommendation."
5,"BOURBON, CIGARETTES AND VIOLENCE","I learned about writing from watching Ben Vandervoort craft this damned fine book. His insights into battle, the spy game and Vietnam are unrivaled. Take my word for it, you'll rip through this tale faster than a blow torch can go through butter. ACE ATKINS, author of CROSSROAD BLUES AND LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES"
1,Rainsuit leaks,"I saw many conflicting reviews, but figured for the price I would take the risk. The suit was definitely not worth the money. The pants leaked the first ride. The suit is uncomfortable and feels of low quality. Although I don't have any experience with other rain suits, I would recommend looking at some suits in person. Good luck"
1,Not well made,The crotch and inside leg seams ripped apart the first time it was worn. Not a very happy experience with this product.
4,one time and good condition,"this book came in on time or as I except it to arrive. It was also, in good condition like the seller stated."
3,Local info.,"A very basic approach to a specific area. I have subscribed to CT, PA,& SC Game & Fish and they are all the same. A quick overview of your area with certain spots/topics picked for a little more indepth writing, but not much content overall."
4,Needs better editing,"It seems to me that Norton can put together the best overview anthology around, but they can't bear to let anything go. All the major authors of the period are covered, but only one question: was the entirety of Paradise Lost really needed, and if it was, couldn't Beggar's Opera have been held off. All the right materials are there, but what is needed is some judicious editing."
3,"Volume 1, 7th Edition","This anthology has some great literature contained within its bindings, but I find some of the changes made since the sixth edition to be questionable; I was very disgruntled to see the Shakespearian songs taken out. The index and table of contents also have something to be desired. It was especially frustrating for me, as a college student, to look at a syllabus created by professor who does not provide us with page numbers to look for poems that were in the anthology, but not in the index. It is very annoying to spend more time looking for a peice than I actually do reading it. The translation of Beowolf is very good, and easy to understand; it was well adapted into modern English without losing its rhyme scheme."
2,Shakespeare would be ashamed,"So yet another lackluster book has forced me to rant like an idiot.It seems typical academic laziness has prompted many English Professors to assign this bulky book for Intro Lit classes--or maybe because there name happens to be on the ""advisory board.""So now it's too much of a burden for them to go to the library and find quality texts of novels and poems? I mean--it's impossible to digest all this material even in TWO classes. So why carry around 1,000 pages of which the student is assigned only 200?In addition, the book makes every author, no matter how diverse their material, equally boring.English Professors have said that they want themselves and their classes to be treated more seriously. Publishing and assigning books like this is not going to make that happen."
1,Do Not Buy,"like other posts have said, the idea is cool, however, the product is defective. I have had mine for only a couple months and the screen continually goes black. Unfortunately, it started happening right after my warranty had expired. I sent my computer in twice and had to pay for the shipping and repairs and the problem still isn't resolved. I now have a thousand dollar paperweight sitting on my desk. Do not buy this computer! You will be severly dissapointed and frustrated to no end. If you're looking for a new computer I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Heavenly!!!!,"This is my first vibrator and I was a little nervous about using it at first, but I was EXTREMELY pleased with how fast it made me climax! I love the extra stimulator. I would definitely recommend this toy to my friends. I was so lucky to have one that worked and gave me amazing pleasure. I bought a vibrator from Spencer's and it came broken, so I never wanted to buy another until now and ladies I am extremely satisfied!"
4,W-O-W,W-O-W!2 minute orgasms! Batteries run out super fast and it would be perfect if it was made a little longer or if it came with a power chord. Decent size and gets the job done!
2,Ok at first....stopped working after 1 month.,"This item has the right idea, but falls short. In my opinion, it needs to be 1 1/2 inches longer and bigger in diameter. The little stimulator is good though. After a month of occasional use, the top stimulator stopped working. It was a let down, so I continue my search for the perfect vibe. After reviewing the other articles, this happens fairly frequently. Bummer."
