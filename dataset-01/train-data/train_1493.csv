3,"Okay, but not long enough","This lock is nice because it is compact enough to fit in my handlebar bag, but it doesn't expand enough (in my humble opinion) to be effective without supplemental chain or whatnot.The keys are easy to use. The lock is pretty heavy (but you want it to be safe, right?)"
5,"""Cape May"" - the world's finest Seashore Town!","This Book tells a lot and shows a lot about my favoriate part of the Atlantic coast. Anyone who wants to know more about all that the southern coast of NJ has to offer should read thid fine book.There is no other place more beautiful in this world then traveling from Stone Harbor thru The Wildwoods and into Cape May. I have been visiting this part of the Country for over 40 years now and this fine book (if possible try to get it in hard back - but it may not come that way)can take you all over the Cape. I'm from Maryland and we have our own Ocean City but it can't hold a match to what a town like Wildwood has to offer. Get the book and visit a real vacation part of the Country that isn't only about booze,B-girls,bars,hippies,queers and Arabs!""ENJOY"" Joe Kopeck"
2,Way overpriced,You can get a brand new set for 250.00 from christianbook.com. Why would u pay 350.00 for a used set
1,Worst ever,"I wanted a good quality tape packing tape dispenser to replace a cheap red one that had been knocking around the garage for years. That one had served well but finally broke while I was putting in a new roll. I chose this one because it seemed like the best of the non-gun grip dispensers. Big mistake! While it's sturdily built, the cutter blade is neither sharp enough, nor sticks out far enough to cut the tape. With each try, you end up mangling the end of the tape before it finally breaks. I tried pulling the blade out a bit and using hot glue to cement it in place, but that didn't work either. After two hours of futzing with it, I finally threw it in the trash. Avoid this one."
1,not a good tape dispensor,after applying the tape the tape sticks back onto the roll instead of staying on the dispensor. it does not work well at all.
4,The title says it all,"I do not understand how some folks rated this book so poorly. It is a really good book that provides good coverage of TCP/IP. It does not get into the ""how to's"" of setting up TCP/IP applications (i.e. web servers, SMTP servers, etc), it does not devote much detail to specific implementations (i.e. UNIX over NT), nor does it compare TCP/IP to other protocols. However, THERE ARE NO CLAIMS THAT IT SHOULD COVER THESE SUBJECTS. What is does do, however, is provide a clear, easy to understand explanation of how TCP/IP works, devoting attention to each layer and its specifics. So why a 4 and not a 5? There are a few chapters that are weak. They cover the very basics of HTML, ActiveX, and Java, so they almost do not fit in with the rest of the book. If Pete Loshin were to scrap those chapters and leave the rest untouched, I would give it a 5."
2,The title is wrong,"I was expecting to find out what TCP/IP was, how it differed from other networking standards, and an explanation of when and how to use the various components. I was disappointed. It took a lot of reading of OTHER material on TCP, and an explanation from a Stanford professor, before I could understand this book.The book could do with editing to check the topic sequence. Often a term is introduced without explanation as if you know what the author means. The explanation MAY come several pages later."
3,Bad,"This book is not only somewhat hard to follow, it is unorganized and BORING. Every time I open this bbook, my eyes start to get heavy. Books usually do not do that to me, but this is the exception..."
1,"Run, do not walk, from this book (3rd ed.)","The book's screen shots are of Netscape, if that gives you any idea of it's topicality. Also it refers to 1999 as current. Of the chapters I have read I feel it is written for a kindergartner, and there is no technical depth whatsoever."
4,"Clear and Straigt-Forward, not Over-Simplified","This is a great book. It is not a book ""for dummies,"" but rather one for people who want a better over-all understanding of the way internetworks operate and the protocols behind them. It is loaded with information which is presented in a very straight-forward manner; one need not be an engineer to read this book, but the information it contains makes it useful to those of us who are engineers. The book's coverage includes (but is not limited to) major network topologies, the format of datagrams and frames, the various layers of the network model and a comprehensive explanation of the major protocols with a briefer look at the more specialized protocols. It even discusses security and encryption. I recommend this book for anyone aiming to become a network engineer or administrator or engineers who require a comprehensive understanding of networking technology (I myself am a software engineer working on client/server applications)."
5,On time and what i needed...,"See above. I am writing additional words to match what it is that i wrote in the title. Seriously, I got what I wanted."
3,Didn't notice much change,Used it for about five months; faithfully the first three or four months then started tapering off because I didn't notice much change in my hair.
3,Didn't notice a difference,"My hair is thin, it's always been thin. I've tried many, many products of this nature and so far I have not found one that works."
4,This Product Works,"I have ordered this product twice and will order again. Great level of Biotin. Unfortunately, the supplier has slow turn around time. Takes at least 10 days to receive product and this is after paying additional shipping/handling fee. Not the usual Amazon service."
1,It does not have the same quality as previous lot. I was also told the manufacturer had a problem with quality of product.,i have beeen using this product for the last 2 months have not seen any change yet. The new order however does not have the same quality as the bottle just finished. The Manager of the company that manufactures this drug indicated to me that the product might be counterfieted and that the American wholesale is not one of the recommened distributor that amazon used. he also admitted that the company had problem with manufacturing of these tablets due to its rotten smell and tase.I do not trust the quality and its legitmacy of the claim of this drug.
4,"It's working well on my hair, BUT...","i ordered this product cause i had problems with my hair falling out a lot. So i decided to give it a shot. Now, i read on different websites that this amount of Biotin can cause break-outs. But on amazon it got so many positive reviews and apparently no side effects, so i said what the heck.I got mixed feelings about this product, thats why i gave it 4 stars: I LOVE IT cause after only 2 weeks of using it ive noticed a Huge difference in my hair- way more stronger than before and it is growing faster, BUT i have break outs! unfortunately. So the bottom line is: its a miracle to my hair, but its causing damages to my face.I'll finish the bottle and will see if im going to reorder it again..."
3,Not a capsule,"I can't say if it works or not but I can tell you that this is a tablet, not a capsule. This is important information for those of us who have trouble taking pills. I had to return them and decided to go with ""NOW Biotin vcaps"". I would like to try these still if I could find them in capsule form."
3,need hair to grow long and fast,"well, ive been taking these for 3 months and havent noticed any visible changes in my hair yet. my derm told me it takes about 6 months to see results so im still waiting. will post again and let you guys know in 3 more months!! ugh!"
1,This book is terrible,"The writing and story are disjointed and the grammar of the author is horrible. I'm not even talking about the quotes of individuals involved, but the author. I'm on page 84 and don't think I'll finish this book. It's too painful to read, and not because of the story it tells."
2,"ok, but could be better","These are kinda cool, but if you're trying to tame your medusa of computer cords like I am, this is not the ticket -- keep looking for the plastic tube to bundle your cords in -- I finally found some at the dollar store!"
2,Useful...,"I have mixed feelings for this book. I bought it with the hopes that it would have more information than it does about sustainabilty, seed-saving, and practicle tips for gardening in different climates. Well, it falls short on those points. There is some useful info, here, but the lack of a table of contents or index of any kind is a little bit annoying. Also, the veggies that are included and those that are not never fail to surprise me. For example, 'cowpea' and 'tomatillo' are missing, along with all kinds of common peppers, but 'chicory' and 'dandelion' are included. So, I rate this one as useful and surprising, but not user-friendly or reliable."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!,"For me this is the best Nupen's film about Jackie. It has ""Who was Jacqueline du Pré?"", ""Interlude with Johannes Brahms"" a previously unpublished interview and ""Remembering Jacqueline du Pré"". It's more than 3 hours of music and words of people who knew her best to enjoy and remember the best cello player of all times.""Heart-Stopping arcchive footage"" The Times"
1,disappointing isn't the word for it,"This is painful to watch. It contains practically nothing of interest to anyone with even a passing acquaintance of the accomplishments of this remarkable person. Don't waste your time on this; get the film of her life ""Hilary and Jackie"". Even with the controversial treatment of her private life, it is much more fun and informative than this title."
5,best example of doom ever,This is the classic Cathedral sound before they changed to those neo-70's rockers. This is a definite classic!
3,"Slow, slow, and slower...","It's so Slooowwwwww, the mind reels, waves of darkness crash down, was it recorded at the correct speed? my god, it's full of stars...FOREST OF EQUILIBRIUM isn't my favorite Cathedral album, but it's certainly their most extreme. Hard to believe that singer Lee Dorrian left Napalm Death's 5-second thrash songs to found this band, with their 15-minutes between chord changes! How extreme an occupation change can you get?"
1,waste of time,Don't waste your time with this movie. Everything about it is fake. Its one of those movies that takes itself seriously while you sit back and laugh at what you are seeing. It's supposed to be a thriller but all it is some stiff acting put together in a supposed pretty package.
1,Great Dames grates on nerves,"I couldn't wait to read about these famous and semi-famous women. Ms. Brenner's choice of personalities is strange. Most of them were dames, all right, but hardly great. The study of these women has absolutely no depth. Most of the women's quotations are mundane phrases, useless in learning more about them. The writing is high-school level...I wondered throughout where the editor was."
4,Very effective,"Like another reviewer I did it this way and found that it worked: ""I take a small shovel and lift up a portion of the tunnel, you can then see the tunnel and place two fingers in it. I place the worm in one of the tunnel ends and replace the dirt. I then go back and pull up the same plug and check to see if the worm was taken in a couple of days.""However, I only used 1/2 worms not whole ones. They took it every time. The first day after feeding the moles, I found one barely alive up on the ground (surface). I felt sorry for it and placed it gently back into the tunnel, NOT! It was crushed immediately.After the first feeding, there was no activity for a few days, but some are coming around again so I will be back out there soon with these delicious treats for them.I also used the smoke bombs, but they did not seem as effective. That was probably because you need to treat the area near the den. How the heck to you know where THAT is?"
5,TRY THIS FIRST!!!,"FINALLY something that works. I wish I would have tried this first. I tried everything else and nothing worked to get rid of the mole in my yard. I tried poison peanuts, a mole trap, sonic spikes, and smoke bombs and nothing got rid of him. (The smoke bombs were a lot of fun though I must add.) I saw this and decided to give it a try as well. I followed the directions precisely except I cut the worms in half before putting in the runways. If you do that, you get 12 pieces instead of just 6. I only used 2 worms (4 pieces) and after a week, I got my mole. The mole surfaced to die so I had proof that it worked. See the picture I took on the product page. It amazes me how such a small creature can be so destructive to a yard. Fortunately, I have 8 pieces left in case this little guy has any friends."
1,You've GOT to be kidding me....,"All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for ""Tomcat"" cause these little ""worms"" are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there. I have used 5 boxes of these (yes, literally 5 boxes) and I have had NO success whatsoever. Granted, I must be a fool for spending over $100 on one product, but I have tried everything else and was desperate. Don't waste your money. Not sure what else to tell you to try though, outside of making sure that your yard doesn't have grubworms."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought 3 packs of these over a period of 2 years and was sticking the worm's halfs left and right into the tunnels in my yard. Moles just kept on digging. Dirt vibrators didn't work, poisoned peanuts didn't work, harpoon trap didn't work. Only yesterday I finally caught one mole with a nash mole trap (choker loop)."
1,Bogus product,"This tops my list as most worthless purchase of the year. The hard to apply, overpackaged guey snake did nothing except stick to me hands and everything it encountered."
2,Small moles ignore these,I have used four different types of traps and three types of bait. The problem with this bait is most of the moles ignore it. Maybe it it too large for the small moles in my yard.
2,Don't waste your money!,I bought these after reading good reviews on them. I am not sure why I did not have the same experience! I used the whole box eventually and did not kill a single pest!! I followed the instructions exactly. They would make new mounds right next to my baited ones!! I would not recommend this product.
5,worked by day two,"excellent product. used as suggested by another reviewer -- cutting worms in 2 or 3 pieces. by second day one of our moles had bought it, doing us the favor of surfacing to die. had tried smoke, traps, and liquids with no success. this product works!"
4,It worked.,"Before I had read about cutting them in thirds, I had purchased two boxes (12 worms). Dead mole on surface within a week. Smashed down the tunnels and am waiting to see if I need to buy more."
1,Not effective,"I placed the worms as directed, even cut some in thirds as another reviewer suggested. I thought it worked, for about 2 days, no new mole activity. They are back and digging up other areas of my garden,It's caving in. I dont dare collaspse the tunnels, as they tunnel in other areas, killing more plants! I tried a 2nd dose and the same thing. As I understand, moles move every couple of days, using different runs, so you think you killed them, then they come back. Next, I'll try the traps."
4,Black Sounds of Freedom Take 2,"Don't let my title fool ya! I love this cd. I also love Black Sounds of Freedom. But the thing I love most about this cd (NOW) is Don Carlos. I prefer his solo releases, but his voice is one of reggae's best. There are quite a bit of remakes of Black Sounds of Freedom on this cd only this time sung by Don Carlos who, by the way, is one of the founding members of Black Uhuru. Included on this release is a strange, but nice remake of Jimi Hendrix's ""HEY JOE"". Don't expect the same Black Uhuru from the Michael Rose/Puma Jones era, but do expect good solid reggae upon delivery. I also HIGHLY recommend Don Carlos's JUST A PASSING GLANCE and DEEPLY CONCERNED (in that order) if you like this release."
3,Easy breazzy ;0),"I like this CD. Very mellow, relaxing. Great on a hot summer day, chillin out by the pool. It's worth having."
2,beginners stamp collection,Not good for small children. On the plus side kit came with lots of information about history of stamps. Did not come with to a lot of stamps. Also flimsy way to afix stamps to book. Overall not a bad start up kit but not the best out there..
2,Disappointed,"We ordered this kit for a beginner at stamp collecting. We expected the album to be free-form, so he could save the stamps that he likes. Instead the album has pages for specific years, starting in 1901, and photos of specific stamps for many of the spaces. I'm not a stamp collector myself, and maybe this is a standard format, but it's not at all what we wanted. The Guide is okay, and the magnifying glass is inexpensive but okay. But we ordered the kit primarily for the album, and it's collecting dust on a shelf."
5,Product Is Very Good,"I have started a stamp collection with my grandson. This was a very helpful tool in getting started. We enjoy looking through the book and all the stamps that came with it.Thanks,J NelmsCalifornia"
1,Broken after 5 minutes!,"We bought this for my 5 year-old son. Within 5 minutes of opening the box we realized we'd made a mistake...The magnifying glass fell apart and the hinges (adhesives for stamps) are very poor quality - frankly, they don't work!The enclosed info. booklet is also VERY basic and explanations are not very detailed.Disappointing."
2,Where Are the Tongs?,"Why do no starter sets for stamp collecting include the basic tool of philately? That is, tongs. This is wrong, and needs to be addressed by the dealers out there. They all claim ""Everything you need,"" but this is not true without tongs.You can find them on Amazon by searching for ""stamp tongs."""
3,incomplete kit,"I was disappointed in the miniscule number of stamp hinges in the kit. Picky, I know, but necessary. A few glassine envelopes would have been helpful too. These items are not readily available in small communities, and must be searched out in speciality stores."
3,This is a pretty good album,First of all I love that it has tons of space and holds 500 photos! The downside is that it's rather cheaply made and the binding is loose. I'd buy it again however because of the price & the space.
5,Beautiful!,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my Grandmother and she loved it! Beautiful well made album. Shipping was quick and arrived right on time. Thanks!
3,Photo & Description Not Accurate At All!,"The album I received looks nothing like the picture listed for this item. The album I received actually looks better but if it had not, I would have been really upset because when you order something you expect to get what you ordered, not something else. There is no snap closure as shown in the picture or described either. I will post pics of how the actual album looks (hopefully, I'm able to do so). I would rate a 5 star but the album advertised is not the album I received, therefore, I cannot rate it."
4,"Flavorful, and full of calories","Introduced late to this work, I keep coming back to it again and again. ""No One Will Ever Love You"" is a great example of good hooks. There's enough here to satisfy almost every type of music listener. Serve yourself up a helping."
3,A mixed bag,"There's no doubt that this is a very interesting recording - musically and lyrically. However, to these ears some songs sound simply wonderful (""Time Enough for Rocking When We're Old"" is a timeless classic - and there are a dozen or so others) many others (the majority) are on the opposite scale - instantly forgettable. If the best 23 of these 69 songs appeared on a single cd, it would be a classic. But the boxed set is not.Wayward Bus is still my favourite."
5,Sensitive love songs from froggy-voiced wiseacre,"This is all very lo-fi indeed...all the arrangements are very basic, even tinny at times, and Stephin Merritt's voice is probably an acquired taste (it brings to mind the formulation Leo Kottke came up with to describe his own voice: geese farts on a muggy day)...but still, this sprawling collection of songs on the many varieties of love, from smooth to crunchy, works impossibly well...some are cynical, many are deeply moving, but even the throwaways stick in the memory...They're all great and there're too many highlights to list here, but my personal favorites (at least today) from the set are: ""Papa Was a Rodeo"", ""The Sun Goes Down..."", ""I Don't Believe in the Sun"", and ""I Don't Want to Get Over You""....Yes, easily one of the best of the '90's."
5,Incredible variety and sound,"I saw the Magnetic Fields at Bumbershoot here in Seattle back over Labor Day weekend, not really knowing what I was going to see. I had heard a couple of songs off of older albums that were entertaining, but a little too synth-y for my taste.The show consisted almost entirely of songs from ""69 Love Songs"" (at least as far as I can tell) and I was completely taken in by the range of sounds, the great singing, and the humorous and introspective (if somewhat morbid) lyrics. There are plenty of bits that stick happily in your head for weeks. I highly recommend these albums -- there is not a weak one in the box.I wish I could think of other groups to compare them with, but I can't really. They share a slight bit of humor (and some low male singing) with Morphine, but the musical style is completely different. I guess you'll just have to click on the various samples above to hear for yourself..."
4,too much of a (mostly) good thing,"It takes some time to listen to this in its entirety and digest it properly. On first listenings I've found it a relief that Stephin Merritt used other vocalists; his vocals are too monotonous to carry 69 songs. There also seems to be less experimental arrangements than with other Magnetic Fields albums. Most of the tracks are acoustic or solo instrumental-backed with occasional keyboard flourishes, and there's a very strong country vibe to the album. Overall, a very impressive feat, but not always compulsive listening."
5,Every Relationship I Have Ever Been In,"I am sure you have all your someone say - or maybe you have even said it yourself - ""that song was written about me!"" Well, these albums were written about every single relationship I have ever been in. Some good, some bitter-sweet, all memorable.To listen to all 3 albums takes a while - but it is easy to appreciate them. I liked almost all of them the first time. When I first heard that Magnetic Fields was putting out a boxed set of 69 love songs, my first reaction was ""how pretentious"". But as a long time fan, I would, of course, give them a chance.This collection is amazing."
5,Anguish and Irony,"If you are fan of intelligent and clever lyrics that never sacrifice humour and irony for the sake of their art, while simultaneously upholding musical/instrumental integrity (yes, there is something for the poet and music snob here), this is quite possibly the perfect album of its kind either before its release or after. Could easily be called the best album of the last ten years, making critically-acclaimed artists such as Radiohead look like experimental hacks."
4,taking the good with the bad,"I'm not sure whether to call this album overrated. It has more than enough amazing songs to fill a standard-length LP, but the amount of completely unbearable tracks in between makes it difficult to listen to. You can't just lie back and relax when any of the 3 discs in this set are on: one finger must continuously stay trained on the skip button.The other problem is that even the amazing tracks have irony-soaked lyrics that can alternately be hilarious and annoying, depending on your mood. some real gems: ""we've got so many tchotchkes we've practically emptied the louvre/ in most of our palaces, there's hardly room to manoeuvre"" (from Zebra, and candidate for one of the greatest rhymes of all time); and ""be we in paris or in lansing/ nothing matters when we're dancing""Most people can't get into something that's basically sublimely beautiful novelty songs, let alone shell out $35 for it. If you know a friend who has it, it's definitely worth a listen."
3,cleverclevercleverclevercleverclevercleverclevercleverclever,"This a ""fabulous"" album, in the least interesting sense of the word. There are some pretty good songs in here, but it can be hard to take the large doses of stifling cuteness that make up the rest.If They Might Be Giants are music for former high school A/V club types, Stephin Merritt makes music for former high school drama club types."
3,There's some flavorful cream amongst all the filling,"It's widely understood that Merritt can write some great pop songs. But can he put together 69 of them ... all about the same theme? The answer of course is no. There's one very good disc worth of tunes in here and Merritt has (ahem) thoughtfully spread them out across all three volumes. But on at least 1/3 of the others you can hear Merritt straining to find another gimmick or genre to diversify the proceedings. Many of these attempts never develop any magic, and the experimental tracks are severely underdeveloped. While there are several fantastic tunes in this set, you'll have to invest a hefty amount of time and money to appreciate them."
4,"Whimsical, Affected, Catchy, Funny, Conceited, Clever...","...with 69 songs there's going to be something to love, and something to hate, on this 3 CD set. None of these songs have energy enough to rise above the crowd and be distinct and memorable, but a lot of the music is infectious, silly, inventive and sometimes beautiful."
5,Jonathan Richman meets Tom Waits,"If you like great, old-fashioned songwriting with a variety of influences and genres, take a chance on this endlessly dazzling set. Get the whole box set, but take the CDs one week or so at a time, until you're familiar with all the songs - it's easier to get into the material that way. Bravo Stephen Merrit, long may your talent shine!"
3,GOOD BUT WAY OVERPRAISED.,This would have been one great cd but unfortunately there are two other cds of forgetable and self-indulgent material to contend with. This box set is a great case of everyone falling all over themselves to praise this work but I really think it does NOT live up to all of the tremendous hype.
3,19 Love Songs would have been better,"It strikes me as I listen to ""69 Love Songs"" that the ""idea"" for doing an album of 69 songs must have come to Stephen Merritt long before the 69 songs did. Not that there aren't some standout tracks (""Absolutely Cuckoo"", ""When My Boy Walks Down The Street"") but they are too few and far between on this massive and unforgivably self-indulgent 3CD set. Still, it's about the best album I've ever heard that had about 40+ mediocre songs on it."
3,The content is good...,"...but I ordered a $36 new boxed set, and how does it arrive? One has a scratched case and one case is broken and the part of it is in the box. Yes, that probably was a mistake in the packaging, but seriously, couldn't they try to protect it a little? That was obnoxious. Hopefully, you will have more luck that I had, because this really is a great album."
3,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Stephen Merritt needs an editor.",There's one CD worth of material here. That might be the greatest CD of the decade but sitting through some of his misses makes me yearn for Kenny Loggins.
3,Very good music but...,"this is way overrated, but this is still a good album. There are a lot of great tracks on record, more good than bad actually, but people who think every track on here is gold are just kidding themselves. About half the songs on each disc are just filler, pure filler. The songs that are outstanding really stick in your mind but this album is all over the place folks. It is not really inconsistent . Just listen to it and get the songs you really like."
3,dissapointing,"I see that many seem to love this set of CDs, so perhaps I just don't ""get it"". I found this set of CDs to be annoying. The lyrics seemed stupid and repetative to me, and as if anyone could have come up with them. I agree with the assessment that the music itself was interetsting - that is the only reason I give this 3 start instead of 1 or 2. I will keep listening - it wouldn't be the first time a CD took me a while to appreciate. For now, though, I don't like this at all."
5,69 Pieces of Rock and Roll Art,Some albums just get right into your soul. This is one of them. Stephen Merritt's heartfelt songs and lyrics are the reason 69 love songs makes a great feel good record.
3,Old Outboard Motor Service Manual,"This is a very useful book but it is not a factory service manual. It contains a lot of useful information on most every brand of outboard motor (under thiry horsepower) built prior to 1969. It contains comprehensive fundamentals and universal service specifications and step by step instructions for hundreds of models as it clearly states on the rear cover.This book is intended for a person who has some knowledge of outboard motors, it clearly states on the cover ""Marine Repair for Professionals"". It contins 264 pages which are well written in an easy to understand technical lanuage. It also contains many useful photos and exploded views which are labeled.The book is a very useful book, but some prior knowledge of outboard is assumed. The copywright date is 1983,this indicates it was written by person who were familar with old outboard motors"
1,Flimsy!,"Super light weight. My husband mounted them on blocks of wood, or they would be unusable. Do not like the plastic at all, but we're on a budget this year. You get what you pay for! Shop around, you'll get a better deal at Walmart."
1,cheaply made,These candles are very cheap. The first ones arrived broken so another set was sent to me but the same thing happened with the next order. I didn't waste my time in trying to send them back. I won't be ordering again from this seller and certainly not these candles.
5,It's an alphabet book - with a very brief story,"Don't buy this if you are looking for another wonderful story about Duck and his farmyard friends, buy this for your toddler. Very few concept books try to tell a story - most of them are just pictures and perhaps a word or two - this one does. Admitedly, with just a couple of words per letter, it's a very brief story (the animals go have a picnic), but it's a nice alternative to most early alphabet books. Our 19-month-old is very fond of this one and the companion volume,Click, Clack, Splish, Splash: A Counting Adventurewhich is also a concept book that tells a story."
3,a disappointment ...,"I bought this through my son's pre-school's book flyer from publisher, so I didn't realize that it wasn't part of the series but just an alphabet book, and a boring one at that. Maybe if he was really into the characters from the other books he would like this.I'd suggest the original Click Clack Moo instead if you want a story.Or if you want an alphabet book, Richard Scarry's Car book from A to Z is fun pictures, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is sing-songy, Bruno Munari's ABC if you want beautiful drawings."
4,Engaging,"The subtle thing about this book is that it will make you think differently about widely held beliefs regarding our origins. In addition to being a great SF romp, it is also something that turns introspective at times and makes you reevaluate many long-accepted theories about where we came from and how we got there.Baxter is in top form in this one. It is occassionally uneven, but, then again, that is true of all of his books. It doesn't detract at all from the book as a whole.I especially loved the notion of tool-wielding dinosaurs. That was quite a hoot. There are numerous examples of similar creates in the book.The Ultimate was also a source of great introspection for me. Is this where we're going? Read the book and judge for yourself."
5,Infinity meets the here-and-now.,"The impact that killed the dinosaurs, the first apes coming out of the trees, the invention of agriculture, the end of human civilization and even the end of the earth, you all witness it in less than 800 pages. It makes you aware how futile our lives are when looked upon from a cosmic perspective, but simultaneously shows how relevant little things are when seen through the eyes of an individual. You'd wish more people read Baxter instead of thousand year old books....I found Evolution absolutely mind-blowing, the best book I've read from him. I'd give Baxter stars if I could."
5,I don't understand some of the more vehement complaints,"Why is it so hard to imagine humanity devolving? You think there is some mystical god who is going to save us from ourselves?I'm frankly much more willing to believe in humanity (d?)evolving into primates who form a symbiosis with trees.And yeah, tool using dinosaurs. I don't find the idea all that out there; I mean, don't chimps use crude tools? Guess what, the book is clearly labeled science fiction and Baxter even included a note at the end explaining that this was largley conjecture.""The long shadow"" was easily the most awesome chapter out of the book, and the one that has made me think most. 1000 years seems like a hell of a long time, but in the grand scale it is nothing... assuming you believe the Earth is older than 12,000 years, that is.This is currently my favorite book, one that I've read probably 10 times now."
4,A Stunning Vision,"This is probably the best book I've read in a long time. As a dedicated Darwinist and Baxter fan, I grabbed this book the second I saw it. The stories stretch from the far past of Pangeae into the far future of New Pangeae and the ultimate destruction of Earth. I immersed myself in the characters, from lowly Purga all the way to poor, lowly Ultimate. My favorite concepts were the Hunters of Pangeae and the sky whale creatures. The entire book was like a wonderful painting of humanity's history as a species and a culture.My only complaint is that at times the stories were hard to work through and I found myself rushing to finish them, this soon stopped when I reached the final three stories about humanity's descendants. Creation-scientists shouldn't read this; their blood pressure's high enough as it is."
1,Under-whelmed,"I am sure Mr. Baxter is a brilliant author, but this is the first book by him I have attempted. I was under-whelmed.I managed to go 100 pages, and it is all prolog; frankly I was tired of it."
1,Coprolite stars in this book,"Well, I made it through the first 24 pages before I fell asleep. I just couldn't face another 534 pages. Its not good fiction and it sure as heck isn't good science. Boring, boring, boring. A 65 million-year-old mammal called Purga? It might as well have been a fish called Wanda. Now that at least was funny. He had his all star cast though, headed up by a savior woman from Africa. All he was missing was a gay Asian doctor, a white Texan cowboy overseer, an Inuit paleoanthropologist, and a lesbian Hispanic pilot."
3,"Something to think about, but nothing to take heart to","I've read it in my library, It does show some good in the book, and some bad.The Good being the whole story format on each period, as well as the descriptive details of past, and future organisms. And how each part has it's own little story to tell.The bad... how the author has an obcession of making all hominids, and no other animal in the book, look like violent, excrement-obcessed id-monsters. From Australopithecus to modern man. Other animals are capable of this, NOT JUST US! That, and also how Baxter must've read a LOT of Dougal Dixon's work, beforehand to get a lot of the future evolution ideas. A little unoriginal, in my opinion.However, if you are a sci-fi fan, and if you have a thing for biology (beit actual, or applicational), this book is something to look for. Just have an open mind."
4,Theoretical story,"Have read this book numerous times by hard copy. Got a kindle and have it downloaded also. I am more of a science geek versus religious know-all. Yes, there are hiccups in the story -v- what we understand our evolutionary history to be. He made it entertaining and gave a theoretical story of where we came from, how humans came to the various continents and where we are going (future) with the choices we as humankind have made. I like it - thoroughly engrossing storyline."
3,Interesting but pedantic,"Having read the Manifold novels thus far, I was looking forward to Evolution. I'm in the middle of the novel, and I hope it becomes more fast-paced toward the end. It probably will; however, I have felt a little like a first-year anthropology student in the midst of all the ""lecturing"" about the morphing of our species. Most of the information relating to Neandertals, etc., I found reminiscent of Jean Auel. The early primate info was different, of course, and Baxter somehow gets us to relate to the inhuman humanity of Purga and her fellow ""ratlike"" prehumans. So far, this novel is leaving me a little dry, but I'm sure there's a river in sight."
2,"A rather ""non-story""","The most interesting idea to come from this book is the evolved state of a dinosaur species, which subsequently was eliminated via a meteor impact. The idea of dinosaurs evolving as Baxter proposed has a lot of potential grist, yet Baxter eliminates this possibility with the meteor impact. Too sad the high point of this evolution story ended early on. Still, I'm a Baxter fan, here looking for more of his work."
2,A bit outdated,"This collection of songs sounds like it was copied from a 1950s LP. In fact, you can almost hear the needle scratching in the background. The songs are sweet, but sound a bit old-fashioned. The worst part though is the muddled audio. I would look elsewhere for a collection of Spanish songs to play for my child."
2,Poor sound quality,"I bought this for my Guatemalan-born toddler son who gets excited and begins dancing whenever he hears Latin music. This just didn't do it for him. I wish I had read the other review before purchasing this CD. The music sounds like old polka music, and the sound quality is horrible. It sounds as if someone tape recorded it off of an old record player. I didn't enjoy listening to it, and my son was not interested, either. I'm glad I spent so little on it."
1,spanish songs hard to hear,"I liked the songs but the singing is very quiet behind the music. Very difficult to sing along to or to distinguish the lyrics, as the vocals sound very echoed. I will very seldomly play the CD."
3,Would not recommend,This product is too hard to open for anyone with arthritis in the hands. The one I ordered went in the trash after 3 weeks trying it.
5,Just what I needed,"In one short week I went from a couple of aspirin a month to 6 meds multiple times a day; but I'm not ""house bound."" I was looking for something that would seperate my meds, remind me to take them, but something smaller than a suitcase so I could stick all my meds in my purse or pocket every morning. This is perfect."
4,Pretty Decent Pill Box,"I turn the box around once the pills are taken so I know the day was not missed. The only shortcoming is one of the larger vitamins misshaped one of sections on only one of the days and it doesn't stay closed.I ignore the ""time of day"" and just put in what I need so all goes well.I lay out one holder each morning and put it on the table for the day. It's easy to put in my lunch bag or purse if I'm going out."
1,Trying To Capitalize On A Legend,"The book is factual in some sense and adlibbed in others. Bruce Lee is a legend, a true martial artist and was a good human being. Joe Lewis is non of these. I know because I have been around Lewis for many years in the tournament and seminar circuit where I witnessed his is arrogance, his rudeness, his disrespect for women and his total lack for professionalism.See if you are in the public eye and you represent the 'Bushido Code' then lead from example. Unfortunately he, nor his book, does any justice for the martial arts in my humble opinion. He is not a Bruce Lee and he will never be a Chuck Norris!"
3,Chuck Norris was 10 times better than Joe Lewis!,"That being said, let me point out that this book is another example of someone cashing in on the legacy and greatness of Bruce. Joe Lewis was just another student of Bruce, and there are others (Jerry Poteet and Dan Inosanto being two of the most well known) who spent much more time training with Bruce than Joe Lewis did. If you want to learn about JKD then you're better off reading the Bruce Lee's Fighting Methods series. Also, in the Art of Expressing The Human Body, author John Little covers Bruce's training routine for Joe Lewis and it certainly wasn't anything extraordinary. Nothing that any pro fighter would do these days. This book is an average read if you've run out of good books on Bruce/Jeet Kune Do. Otherwise, stick to the John Little books because they're written from the notes and interviews directly from Bruce and his (long term) former students."
5,Worthwhile Book from One of the Greatest,"It doesn't matter if you like Joe Lewis or not, some of the BEST Martial Artists of ALL Time have contributed to this long overdue book by 'The Greatest Karate Fighter of All Time' ... No one is taking anything away from Bruce Lee ... No one is riding any body's coat tails ... Everyone who contributed to this book recognizes what Bruce Lee did for the Martial Arts here in the United States ... Joe Lewis has done everyone a good deed by bringing everyone thats anyone in American Martial Arts together in one publication while being fair to their honorable friend who made it all possible for them, Bruce Lee."
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this harp. I decided to buy the Meghan as I already own the 22 string Heather harp which is also made by Mid East. I am very pleased with the Heather, and I highly recommend it. The Meghan, however, is very nice as long as I only want to play in the key of C. Almost all of the sharpening levers need adjusting which is something beyond my capabilities. I have 30 days to decide if I should return this harp, and I must spend that time trying to find someone nearby who can fix the sharpening levers at a reasonable price. In my opinion, this instrument should have arrived in playable condition; I should not have to pay extra to have it fixed, nor have to spend time trying find someone capable of fixing it."
1,Blum will replace defective hinges no charge!,"Contact Blum customer service for free replacement of broken 110 degree Compact 33 hinges. Like others, I have had many of these hinges break. I called Blum to determine which replacement units to purchase, and they said they would send me free replacements. Blum claims that they have improved the performance. We'll see. Kudos for free replacement, too bad they didn't get it right the first time."
1,Save Your Money,After reading the other reviews I contacted blum and they confirmed that these hinges are under warranty and will be replaced at no charge. Afterpaying for replacements every 6 months this was great news and I just want to say that I will shop amazon first from now on.Blum 33.3600 Compact 33 Screw On 110 Degree Opening Face Frame Hinge
3,Hinge Changes,"Do to changes in the orginal hinge by the manufacture, both parts of the hinge should have been ordered.The hinge did not work with the part from the old hinge, simply by reversing the hinge.The door did not close fully."
3,Free Blum replacements: How to tell it's broken,"Blum 33.3600 Compact 33 Screw On 110 Degree Opening Face Frame HingeYes, some of them do break after a few years, but Blum was quick to send replacements, without question, for entire doors rather than for individual hinges. Unless the whole door is broken, the only way to identify the individual defective hinges is to remove and close them. If the metal hinge pin is no longer covered by a black plastic tongue, it's a broken hinge. On my bathroom doors, which are lighter and less frequently opened, these hinges have worked fine for years."
2,problem with Blum 33 compact hinge,"glad i read the reviews for Blum 33 compact hinges. i too have these hinges on my cabinets and like others the small plastic peice inside the cups break. in the past i'd order and pay for replacements but now, thanks to Amazon, i've discoverd they are guaranteed so i've emailed Blum and asked for replacements. Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,Worked just fine,"This is a lot better than buying both parts at the store, because only one part breaks. Much less costly too."
2,Call Manufacturer first!,"After reading all the reviews, I called ""Blum"" at 800-438-6788 and ask for customer services. They told me the hinges are warranted to the original owner (which is me) SO they are sending me 25 new hinges. (I may need more) But THANKs for your reviews. You saved me lots of money!"
3,plastic closer tends to break after a year or two,"item is what was installed on our cabinets and works well, but as said above it does tend to break with regular use"
2,"If you have another option, don't choose this one....","Our cabinets were refaced 10-15 years ago (prior to us owning the house) and these were the hinges chosen. The ""downer"" is that I've had to replace about 10 of these hinges because the plastic inners end-up degrading to a point where they crack/fail and the hinges no longer close on their own anymore. If I had another (all-metal) option, I would try but I have been unable to find one that fits the same."
1,Does not last - buy 38 or 39 instead,"These compact 33 hinges are terrible. I'm in the process of replacing dozens of them that were originally installed on my kitchen and bath cabinets. The problem is that the closing spring pressure is applied via a plastic part that tends to break, and then your cabinet doors stand open instead of closing.The 38N / 39C models are much more robust, with a metal spring, and they are a direct replacement - no drilling new holes."
1,Not one of Blum's better products,"There is only one small piece on this hinge that is plastic, but unfortunately it will eventually break. The cabinet may continue to work (more or less), but until the defective hinge is replaced the cabinet will make snapping and popping noises each time it is opened or closed. Other reviewers have some good ideas about alternatives in case you already have purchased the Compact 33 hinge and experienced the plastic piece breaking. If you haven't purchased these yet.............don't. Blum may make some quality hinges, this just isn't one of them."
2,John Henry smith A Humorus romance of Outdoor Life,The story was too dated. for me th enjoy and I really don't care that much about golf and country club life
5,Great book!,"This book, as promised was in excellent condition and came in a timely manner. I'm using this book for a discrete mathematics course, and it serves as a very helpful tool in understanding what is going on."
3,lightweight yet strong,I purchased a set of these bags to carry my shower items to the gym shower. They are strong enough to hold the five medium and small size bottles of products. The material dries quickly. I have been using them for two months now and am pleased thus far. I hope the material can withstand the daily wet and dry over the long term.
2,Not for a 2004 Subaru Impreza,"The quality of the plastic for $21.99 is better than expected. My problem is strictly based on these 15"" wheel covers not fitting my 2004 Subaru Impreza TS Wagon 15"" steel wheels. As another reviewer seems to have indicated they seem a bit small and consequently they don't seat correctly. One of the plastic brackets broke as well, while installing. Consequently for those who are looking for wheel covers that do work I already ordered and received the following: Drive Accessories KT993-15S/L 15"" Silver and Lacquer ABS Plastic Wheel Cover Replica Hubcaps - Pack of 4, and these fit excellent. They run $25.99, so don't expect great wheel covers but much better than $50 for one Subaru OEM. How they'll stand up to the Colorado elements, we'll see."
4,A Book More Doctors Should Read,Dr. Breggin points out the side effects of psychiatric drugs and procedures that many doctors either ignore or don't know about due to drug company hype and the FDA's shoddy oversight. I wish more doctors would read this book before they prescribe dangerous drugs and procedures who's long term effects are in many cases still unknown.
3,I almost hate to admit it...,"but I like this cd even less than Amusing. This new sound of Mr Rice's just doesn't seem to fit him. I like a few of the songs here, but the lyrics and music overall are not as inspiring as on his previous efforts. I'd actually rather listen to Amusing, as some of the songs there are more reflective of the Chris Rice I know and love. And I highly recommend any of his projects prior to Amusing. There are two songs missing from Amazon's track list for this cd...#12 Kids Again and #13 Baby Take Your Bow. I guess my favorite tracks are Pardon My Dust (Love it, love it, love it) and What a Heart is Beating For."
4,Calm like a river,This a real peaceful recording. It has a warm calming affect. Reminds me of some of James Taylors early albums. It's joyful. It's a warm comforting experience.
4,Risen,"i like it, I know that this might sound weird, but I did find humor in it. It is the classic good and evil thing, entertaining though. did not give much of an explanation behind all of it."
3,Kill 'em all,"This was a very different book. I loved the twists throughout the book. It was fast-paced and kept me reading it. I did think that it was a little weird to insert the girl near the end for Tom to side with. It seemed like a last-minute thought for the author and like he went back and just added her in. I found myself hoping with doubt that the little girl in a coma would see a miracle happen. Even though this was a focus in the book, it wasn't the main point. In all, I guess it turned out ok."
5,Gave me nightmares!,"Not many books I've read are so horrifying that I dream about them. The last time I can remember this happening was back when Stephen King published ""Salem's Lot."" I would have nightmares each time I read and reread it. LOLThe story line in ""Risen: A Supernatural Thriller"" is well put together and the characters are believable. Actually, the whole premise of the book seems like something that, just maybe, could come to pass. And the fact that you can't really tell the good guys from the bad guys makes it even more scary! Makes you take a closer look at your neighbors and the guy who delivers the pizza.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't faint at heart. It's a great book and I look forward to reading more of Mr. Strnad's work."
1,this is not a zombie book,"im sorry but i bought this book because of the reviews that it got but it really sucked it wasnt scary or exciting. i have read many zombie books this one was the worst. if you want a good scare get the rising by brian keene he has made a second to that novel called city of the dead, and also reign of the dead was way better than this book, put this book down and send it back please!"
3,Not terrible but not scary either.,"Like most of my book reviews I'll start by saying that it was not at all frightening to me but was an interesting enough story to keep me reading til the end. I got the impression that it wasn't completely original...I had a slight bit of deja vu while reading. I'd recommend this book to King or Koontz fans however, I personally wouldn't read him again but only because he was too light for me."
3,sounds an awful lot like...,"Dead and Buried. Anybody seen it? 1980 horror flick in which ""zombies"" are really townspeople made over by the morgue attendant. Wondering if this was ""inspired"" by it...There's even a ""Sad"" twist ending to that one, too. Just wondering..."
5,Fantastic Read,Zombies but not zombies. Loved it! It was crazy and you were not sure exactly what was going to happen!
3,"Ok, I admit that this was a scary book....",One of the first ones I have read in a while. It was very well edited for a Kindle book and I appreciate that. My only complaint is that it was a tad too long and got slow in places. A good read.
4,Not a bad book,Very well written i am a huge stephen king fan and would place this book up with some of kings best . take this book for a spin
4,Glad I found this book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is an unsettling tale in the order of Stephen King, but that's what makes it so delicious. I found the characters and setting realistic and believable. The plot was compelling and not predictable. I couldnt stop thinking about this book when I did put it down, so I had to stay up and finish it to find out what would happen. I will be looking for more from this author."
4,Don't miss the scene in the church!,"Risen pulls off a neat trick. It starts out Dave-Barry droll. Then it darkens. Then the turns and shocks come, climaxing with a twist that seems unthinkable in a thriller of this sort -- until you see Strnad's set it up so well it's perfect, logical, and emotionally acceptable, despite its horror (it happens in the church scene). I read several thrillers a year. This is in the top rank.This is the same Jan Strnad of comics fame. He even got buddy Rich Corben to do his cover."
3,"Quirky good read, but...","This one is hard to pin down. It is a good book, well written and graphic enough in the gore to keep horror fans happy (The ""Death by undead roach swarm attack"" made me wince). BUT...It doesn't give one much explanation (in the end) for WHY it is happening, most of the characters are hard to care about and the one or two that are are not explored much. Worst of all, after investing time and effort; this book has one of the SUCKIEST endings I have ever read. Unsatifying!Read it in a waiting room..."
2,Nothing new here....,"I read through Risen in a couple of days, and, though it was enough to keep my interest, it wasn't anything overly exciting. I felt the ending was too quick and forced to really build the suspense necessary to make the book as fascinating as it could have been. Some of the characters were developed partially, but not as far as needed because I wasn't truly concerned about the fate of any of the population. I was actually almost offended by the suggestion that this could hold any sort of light next to King's or Koontz's work. It's a nice brain candy read, but nothing more. I understand this isn't a die hard zombie fan book, but if you want serious zombie fiction, look back to 'The Book of the Dead"" anthologies published in the late 80s and early 90s."
2,Ersatz King,"A small town, an eclectic bunch of townies, mysterious doings, old newspaper clippings explaining similar past deeds, and a dark stranger - we have all seen this before. It not that Strnad's Risen is a poor book, it is because it emulates and honours too closely the works of King and Koontz who have saturated shelves with such outings. On its own, the book starts slowly in an effort to build suspense but it is arguably too slow. And by the time the action starts we see very familiar patterns that diminish any thrills."
3,Started out good...then not so much,"I had this book on my Kindle for quite some time before I started reading it. It started out pretty interesting, good character building. And then, when ""Seth"" was introduced and this cult-ish like feel started coming out, I was pretty much done with it. I could see where it would go with Annie and some of the other characters. I skipped to the end and read the last two chapters and other than a little light romance between the two people left, didn't really feel I missed that much. I think the book would have been much better as a plain old ""dead come back to life/join forces to kill aforementioned 'dead' again"" book. I am glad it was free when I downloaded it."
2,lost,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE PREDICTABLE. THE STORY IS WEAK AND THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT LIKABLE. I COULD NOT MAKE MYSELF FINISH IT. I READ 70% BEFORE I GAVE IT UP
3,Good read,Kept my attentionEasy to get lost in the story and characters were believable though I believe the ending could have had a better twist.
5,Very Entertaining!,"I bought Risen many months ago when I first got my Kindle, but there were so many books to read that it got pushed to the back and neglected. Not long ago, I decided to choose books from the last pages of my Kindle rather than the newly selected books. That's when I found Risen. I knew nothing about it, but it grabbed me right from the beginning. The characters pulled you in immediately. I'd never read a zombie-type story before and if I thought they were all like Risen, it would be my new genre. But something tells me Jan Strnad is special in that regard. It's a great adventure story and I would recommend this to anyone. If you're not sure, try it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Very well written and I was sorry to see it end. I'll definitely be looking for more books from this author."
3,Not the greatest!,"This was not the greatest supernatural thriller. It was a bit predictable but somewhat entertaining. It was a quick read, which is sometimes just the thing you need. I would try this author again to see if his style has improved."
4,Derivative but enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading this book, although to me seemed like it was Salem's Lot revisited, but without vampires this time. However, with so much unmitigated shite prevalent within the eBook world, this stands out as a solid craftsman-like effort. The Kindle formatting is less than perfect (line spacing), causing some distraction, but you get used to it as it is consistent.The author definitely merits a further look, and I will be doing so."
2,Not a very good book,"Beware of academics praising each other's work. This is a dull summary of ""white supremacy"" and ""antisemitism."" The author, while posing as a clinically disinterested party, lets us know how awful he thinks both of these things are.He DOES say that ""racism exists when one ethnic group or historical collectivity dominates, excludes, or seeks to eliminate another on the basis of differences that it believes are hereditary and unalterable.""This should comfort those who, for example, deplore the conditions in American inner cities, and attribute those conditions to the moral and cultural state of the residents of those cities. While some would call these people ""racists,"" the definition shows that they are not -- unless, of course, those moral and cultural states are believed to be hereditary and unalterable."
5,THIS IS THE BEST! ALL OF THEM ARE!,"HorseFeathers are the BEST BOOKS EVER!Of course MUCH better then Heartland i find those books...well.. rather BORING! i just skip skip skip end of book! Boring, but as i say everyone has a diffrent taste in everything.But these books! WOW a book you would never put DOWN! Love em' love em ALL!"
5,Classy Classic,"Habit Rouge is a child of the 60s from the famous Parisian fashion house, Guerlain. The fact that its lasted for so long is a statement in itself.Habit Rouge was created in the days when cologne was made from natural products: not from loud, unsubtle, chemical blends that we tend to smell in today's products.So if classic and class is your mantra then why not try this great old French oldie!"
3,"Not quite sure yet,","I just got this item shipping was exellent!! no problem with seller, just not quite sure about the scent yet. It is powerful at first but then settles down to a nice fragrance."
3,Heartwarming and fun!!,"This was just a wonderfully heartwarming film. If you were touched by the first movie, Three Men and a Baby, then this will fulfill that desire on what's happening in the fictional lives of these wonderful characters. This movie was not as good as the first, of course... but it is still warm and entertaining. There are many topics that would keep me from allowing my children to watch with me... mainly abandonment from a parent - not something that I want them to think about. In this case that was abandonment by the mother - so although the movie is good, and sometimes rather funny - - - - this topic is what would keep me from giving this movie a higher rating."
2,Be Warned!,"Great sequel but I'm disappointed that it's in pan & scan. What really baffles me is that ""Three Men and a Baby"" is released in widescreen."
4,Smashing,"What a pleasant, romantic, thoroughly nice film this is!Carrying on from Three Men and a Baby, this is set several years later and Mary is now five. Peter (Selleck) is in love with Mary's mother, Sylvia (Travis) but because of past relationship problems he won't admit his feelings.Sylvia feels the same way as Peter but wants Mary to have a settled home with just one father instead of three and so when Peter won't commit, she agrees to marry another man. As he's British, Mary and Sylvia then have to go to England to live.Does Peter go and get his girls? It's a romance! What do you think?The touching love scene's between Peter and Sylvia are fantastic and the comedy is light and warm-hearted. A must have film for all romantic's out there."
1,Exactly!,"I play these games, and they've got it all right! I can't tellyou how many times I've been tempted to kill my classmates. Oh, wait,I can. Zero. But I'm an exception. As I write this, there are 11920people playing Half-Life, 32123 playing Quake 3, 2441 playing Unreal Tournament, and 4830 playing other popular games. This is far from peak times for these games, yet there are 51314 people on at the moment. Somehow, there will be no shootings today, tomorrow, or even this week. ... Ask yourself, if these games truly do make normal, well-adjusted kids kill, why is anyone even alive to debate the point? Instead, spend time with your own kids, and if they are unbalanced enough to kill, don't ignore them, get them help."
1,This is utter BS,"A quote from a reviewThe FBI says that the average, experienced, qualified law enforcement officer, in the average shootout, at an average range of seven yards, hits with less than one bullet in five. How does a child acquire such killing ability? What would lead him to go out and commit such a horrific act?Well it certanily isin't from Video games. Moving a mouse and cliking where you want to fire is not how one learns to shoot. In order to learn to shoot, you have to shoot. Video games cannont realistically simulate the actuall situation. Many things are taken into accout: The fact that this is real, the fact that a gun recoils, and the fact taht the targets are more than jut polygons."
4,Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill,This book presents a very interesting hypothesis. That exposure to simulated violence in media and games causes our children to be more aggressive and willing to act it out. The concept is well developed through the book. Many anecdotal stories are offered as evidence as well as several studies in the book. The writing style is easy to follow and held my attention. Rigorous testing of this will be as interesting to follow.The one negative note I had was the footnoting used. There is no specific footnoting per se but rather a generalized system for each chapter at the back of the book. In the chapters you won't find alphanumeric footnote marks to correlate the passages to the references. I did search the internet for the references and found many of the ones available online but it was a lot of work to make the correlations myself.
4,Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill,"This book hits upon a topic that has become severe in this country; youth violence. It discusses many avenues that contribute to our youth using violence against each other. It brings to light numerous strategies that parents, teachers, and other adult agencies can use to decrease, if not completely vanish, the violence seen in our youth. Fantastically written, this book is a must read for anyone who has kids, deals with kids, or is just a member of our society."
5,Move Out and Draw Fire,"Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano are sure to draw fire from the video and media industries for their analytical look at the impact that violent media has on our kids. This is a must read book for anyone that is serious about being a parent. They are not afraid to tell it like it is when they point how the exposure to violent media can have a harmful impact on our youth. They are not against the first amendment, but they are strong advocates for the responsible application of standards to the sale of violent videos. What is more important, industry profits or the safety of our children?"
1,Propaganda,"This book is nothing more than foolish propaganda. How could anyone believe that playing a game such as Doom is anything like firing a real weapon? Also, kids have been playing violent games since long before computers came around, even such things as pointing a finger and saying ""BANG! You're dead!"" Some people are always looking for something to blame for any trouble, when the real culprit is the fact that people are inherently unstable and violent."
1,Wreckless hyperbole.,"Dave Grossman and Gloria Degaetano have unfortunately written a book based on poor research and false public perception on violent media. I have no doubt they mean well, but using violent media as a scapegoat ignores the issues that lead to youth violence, such as poor upbringing and domestic violence. Youth violence has been on a severe decline since 1993 according to the department of justice, despite the skyrocketing sales of violent media since then.If you want a more objective look at violent media, I recommend ""Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do"" by by Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson."
4,Highly credible with an interesting approach,"The authors explore the possibility that violence committed by young people results from what they learn through television, movies, and video games. They cite scientific studies and research to emphasize that children actually learn how to kill by viewing these games and programs. It takes an in-depth look at media violence, but does not touch on the other media-related social problems."
5,"Compelling. Visionary. Gutsy. Gut-Wrenching. ""Must Read""","I don't have children AND this topic is of huge importance to me. What I do have is a five-year-old nephew and other children in my life and this book gives me a huge perspective on today's culture, media influences and how I can proactively support and guide the little humans around me as they grow up in our obsessed media culture. This book is a road map for people committed to mentoring and growing children away from the tube and other video influences and also provides a deeply important historical reference so we know where we've been and why we don't want to go there any more. Buy this book - it's gutsy and full and especially great for aunts and uncles, too."
5,An important voice for America's children,"David Grossman and his colleague have done an important service for America's children. Grossman has been a national leader in sounding the alarm about the dangers of point-and-schoot video games in the psychological functioning of our children, particularly our boys. As a military psychologist, he knows first hand the crucial role that ""training"" plays in the violent behavior. He argues convincingly that point and shoot video games in particular and the larger environment of violent video images in general is undermining our kids. At a time when we are concerned about youth violence it is imperative that we see clearly how each piece of the chain of causation operations. This book is an invaluable tool in seeing clearly and then acting intelligently."
1,Insanity,"I could write a long drawn out response to this nonsense, but what would be the point? According to people like the author of this book, American youths are at risk for violent behavior because they enjoy watching violent movies and playing video games. Hey, I've been playing games and watching movies all of my life. Now I'm trained for hunting everything from mutant space aliens to helpless people. Maybe I should exercise all I've learned from the media, then I could rationalize all of your delusions. Of course, I wouldn't do something like that...for one simple reason: I'm not insane.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or your money on this trash. Stop looking for a scapegoat, the media is not to blame. Place fault where fault is due: poor parenting."
1,Just another way to find scapegoats for societies problems,"All this book does is try to blame all of today's problems on video games, and other media. Studies have recently shown that the kids who are most likely to play violent video games are LESS likely by far to commit real violence. They are able to let out their frustration in a fantasy setting, rather then on their peers. There is very little plausible evidence in this book, and more clinical studies should have been done before releasing a book such as this."
4,Nice watch especially for the price,"I was looking for an inexpensive watch that looks somewhat ""dressy"". The gold face on this watch does just that. The black numbers on the gold face are easy to read for my aging eyes. I like the gold second-hand because it's inconspicuous, but it too is easily seen. My only disappointment is the rubber strap, but I'm sure when that goes, I'll be able to put a nice leather one on to replace it. And my experience is that Casio makes a good watch.I would recommend this product."
3,Pretty little watch,"I got this watch because I have a brown leather watch with silver hardware and I wanted something I could wear with gold. It was quite reasonable, so it wasn't a big risk. I like this watch, I'd say it's a bit elegant in styling, although the band is fair. What does annoy me is that the little tag or covering that keeps the band flap close to the band itself moves back a lot and I have to re-adjust this and it can get annoying. But, for the price, it is well styled, keeps really great time and does the trick with black and/or gold is called for."
4,better value for money,"this is a cute little watch.. the strap sometimes comes out.. but, overall, i liked the product.."
5,In love with this little watch!,I wanted a little black antique looking watch and this was great! :) The order came on time and the watch was wrapped up nicely~
4,Cheap and Simple,"This watch is exactly as advertised. Cheap, simple, readable and useable. It is what it is, and gets the job done."
1,Time Only Correct Twice A Day!!!,I received this watch Casio Women's LQ139D-9B1 along with another watch which works fine. THIS Watch HAS NOT WORKED since I took it out of box!!I tried to find out about RETURNING it But They keep telling me to PRINT OUT a Shipping Label. For some reason I am NOT.. able TO print out a label. I don't seewhy they don't offer an Address I can return it to. It is very frustrating and makes me wonder if I want to continue to buy anthing else from Amazon.com.
4,Great Reasonable Watch,"This is about the fourth Casio watch that I have owned..Yes, I like my watches plain and simple. It has a gold face and is a little more dressy than the others I have.. All in all, it is a great little watch for the money.. I will pay more for batteries over time than it is worth, but if it is like my other Casio watches, it will give me many years of wear..."
1,Batteries dead,It didnt work right out from the box. I had to spend few dollars to replace its battery at the jewllers. Now it seem to work OK
2,nice little time piece,This watch was recieved in great condition. It is a nice watch for the money. My only complaint is that i bought it for myself (an over-weight adult) and the band is a bit tight to the point it will shut off my circulation. I would suggest it as a great buy for those of small bone structure a younger person.
4,can't beat the price,I was looking for a new watch. Originally had a $200 watch in my cart until I stumbled upon this.Love the look. and the size totally works as i am really petite. The band is really good for small wrists..I usually have to remove links off of my jewelry or get resized...this was perfect.Keep the money in your wallet....or buy another watch...you deserve it!!
2,A dud.,"Try and get to listen to this recording before you buy it. It is not one of his better CDs. His earlier works are WAY better. I will continue to support Jarre's music, this is just not one of his better works. Oh well."
3,"Me, too! Punk","Little original found here. Some licks that make me wonder if they used to listen to a lot of old Rush. Can't hold a candle to either the Sex Pistols or Green Day. Drab. But, if you like midrange punk, with a nod to commercial rock, by all means, add this one to your collection. Personally, I don't regret the 99 cents I paid for this at a clearance sale. Save your cash for an outing to a club ...Two stars for ""Ho Hum,"" four stars for the occasional interesting guitar riff & some dynamic openings. Averages to three stars, which is probably more than it deserves."
4,Excelent book if you want to pass the test,This was an excelent study guide for passing the test. I was able to retain much more information from this book than the Examcram book. I was able to pass this test with flying colors.
2,Not worth it!,"This is my first purchase of an IDG book to study for a certification test, and I'm afraid it will be the last. The informations was not always presented clearly and I found the editing to be terrible. Not to mention that I could not always count on the information to be accurate. Go somewhere else if you need a book to help you study for this exam."
4,GREAT STUDY GUIDE FOR PASSING TEST,"I had read the book I received from the atec I took the course at. It was okay the dummies book brought it all together for a grade of 900 not bad for a guy that never looked at a computer before 5 months ago. The only thing they should do is make the questions more difficult. I really recommend it to anyone looking for a good study guide for exam 70-073, also try the microsoft readiness review for workstation just to see a variety of different questions. GOOD LUCK TO ALL."
2,Great layout but filled with errors,"This book is well laid out and an interesting read. However, there are many mistakes and to someone who doesn't know better, the book will be very misleading at times. Dummies, sort out the mitakes and you'll have one of the best MCSE preparatory books around!"
4,Offers many many questions to help learn,I saw this book as somewhat basic but very easy to understand and has good focus on the test. The CD has a great number of questions to help you learn facts and a few questions mimic the test. The test was adaptive which I realy liked. I give the book a 4 out of 5 due to a few of the questions had wrong answers.
2,"Get real, another diet book and how's that working for ya.","Gotta hand it to Dr. Phil. The man is a marketing machine. Good for him. I suppose if you need somebody to tell you how to lose weight, he just might be the man.I never have had a weight problem, lucky me, but someone gave me this book and I thought I would read a ""diet"" book. Pretty basic stuff it seems. But what do I know, except the cover shot of him just wreaks cornball."
3,"Common sense diet advice but great ""head"" advice.","OK Folks, when my wife first started doing the Dr. Phil says, ""Yadda, yadda, yadda"" to me, I tuned out. And then, after while, she started to make sense. Or should that be Phill started to make sense. She brought this book home last night and I read almost all of it. Parts were old news - like eating more fiber and veggies. Parts were good old fashioned (i.e., brilliant advice, like getting rid of your old fat clothes and changing your environment. He makes sense and I plan to make it back into my old jeans. :)"
4,A,"the best and most complete book I read on the emotional side of eating, but lacks detail in the excercise portion"
4,Doctor recommended,"My doctor recommended this book, so I bought the book and book on CD to listen to on the way to work.Dr. Phil - like him or hate him - has some very good information here. Weight loss and diet control still boils down to the basics: Eat less and move more...but you have to start with eating healthy and getting your habits and mindset ready to get yourself more healthy.Old habits are hard to break, but Dr. Phil's solutions are not rocket science, and could save you from many health problems and weight gains. They are simple, easy to follow instructions and mindsets that will help you suceed.It's working for me, and I know if you have a family health history as I did, it can work for you to. You may not like Dr. Phil, but his advise, foundation, and information is right on the mark."
1,Ho Hum. Nothing New.,"Dr.Phil's book holds nothing new for someone struggling with a weight problem. It's all behavioral and we have heard it all before. Ho hum. Anyone who's been struggling with weight knows this stuff but has difficulty implementing it. Unfortunately, Dr. Phil doesn't take it to the next level.Fortunately and gratefully, someone has taken it to the next level: Laurel Mellin in her book THE PATHWAY!In this wonderful book, Laurel identifies why we struggle and provides a skill set to end the struggle with all those excesses (not just overeating)that interfere with our having the quality of life we want for ourselves.Good bye Dr. Phil. Hello Laurel. Thank you for The Pathway!"
1,The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Free,"First the ""7 Keys"" are nothing new. Dr. Phil is just talking about information that has been known for a long time and passing it off as his own. His claim that he ""doesn't think he has the answer, he knows he has the answer"" just shows how egotistical he is. If he does have any good information, his arogant style is hard to take. It's hard to hear someone when they are talking down to you. Being ""honest"" doesn't mean brow beating. It would be a lot easier to take if he really talked honestly, using facts and information instead of demeaning people."
4,I'm just starting to read it but am appalled...,"...by what people are saying in their reviews! If Dr. Phil is ""Fat"", I say ""Bring it on!"" As someone who has struggled with weight her whole life, I'd give anything to be as ""fat"" as he is!If you don't like a book, give constructive critism, without throwing personal stones. It's annoying to more mature audiences.I'll give the book a proper review once I finish reading it."
4,Down to Earth Advice for Diet Strategies,"As usual, Dr. Phil McGraw is to the point in this lifestyle guide. There are some unique insights and strategies in the midst of information that many of us know but try to ignore. He does not cater to justifications for our habits and quick fix eating choices. I recommend this book as a good source of self-control strategies and what we should and should not allow to go into our bodies."
2,Weight Loss books,"This book is a bunch of bull. I didn't find anything in it that I haven't already heard about eating right & exercising . I donated in a free book exchange....maybe somebody will find it useful, but I did not."
2,Waste of time!,He talked too much about himself. Almost got halfway thru before he actually gave any tips. Wasn't that impressed with the book.
5,Love this book,"it is a good companion to the original book, I do not know what I did without it. Love it."
4,Great,"Interesting, informative, fun and very dr phil! Go for it, read it and go with it, he has so much advice to give."
2,The Ult. Weight Sol.,Dr. Phil is not a diet expert - as most of the others who write books think they are. Don't make the same mistake I made. Not worth it.
2,In my opinion:,Although most of what the book says is true-the basic rule is eat well (3 meals a day) and think before you put something in your mouth. Try to be a little more active in your daily routine.It's all well and good to advise that we all exercise however an 8 hour workday and family at home (another job) does not always leave time for one's self.This book is basically common sense stuff.
1,marketing for the masses,Only in America can a fat man write a diet book and have it go to the top of the best seller list by the force of pure marketing. I would think that people would be insulted by this shameless attempt at a quick buck.
2,"Buy it, and read it while you are running on a treadmill","Why? Because honestly that's the only way this book (or any book) will help you lose weight. For free, I will tell you how to live at a healthy weight:1. Eat well (balanced meals).2. Eat in moderation.3. Get enough exercise.If you don't do all three you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be a healthy weight.Now donate the money you just saved to a good cause, get out of the computer chair, and get on with your life."
1,A grab for the gold,"I've been a fan of dr phil's show and previous books, but it's obvious what happened here:he (or maybe his business manager) noticed how many diet books are best-sellers, so he figured he'd cash in too. My wife bought this the day it came out, and even she agrees--there's nothing new or even particularly useful, just the same old tough-love dr phil machine now turning its attention to obesity. And as several others have pointed out, dr phil lecturing you on why you're fat is the pot calling the kettle black. couldn't he at least have lost 10 pounds before this book came out? earlier this summer we bought The South Beach Diet, which has some real nutritional information and a practical diet plan going for it, more than I can say for this cynical attempt by the good doctor. (And we lost weight, too!)"
1,"Physician, heal thyself...","As with many readers, I find the recent trend of diet ""gurus"" troubling, with many not exactly in the best shape or fitness level advocated in their works. I would like to see a bit more of some of the authors with at least some degree of perceivable fitnesss, like say, Bill Philips, or the pair of Asian co-authors of the international bestseller ""This Body This Life""."
1,Dont buy it!!!,"I purchased this book with anticipation that it would be good.It is one of the worst diet books on the market and I have read a million. It reads like a ""wanna be"" diet book or in other words it seems to be trying to hard to convince you that the material is on target when in fact it is way off base.The credibility of the author is in question after reading this book."
3,May be worth the buy for some...,"I read the book cover-to-cover and it was okay. The eating plan is really nothing new at all, this part was extremely boring for me, some basic information you can get for free online or pamphlet in your doctor's office. I did like his explanation on the hows and whys of emotional eating and found some of the advice helpful, doing the work really helps.However, as I continued to watch Dr. Phil on various television shows recently I have found the summaries (7 steps) work just as well as the book's version. The book does get into a little more detail but by and large one can still totally benefit without buying the book. If you're a big Dr. Phil fan then you'll like it but if you want to try it then I suggest you buy the current O magazine because it gives you all the tools to start now. The article is detailed and I found even more helpful in the summarized version and best of all it's a lot cheaper than the book."
2,The Ultimate? - Please!,"I'm a licensed healthcare professional specializing in eating disorders, including obesity and I took an interest in what Dr. Phil would say that was helpful for such a misunderstood problem.After reviewing the book, I kept looking for something definitive that would give a new slant about a very old problem. The result was not much different than an obese patient of mine heard from her physician after he weighed her. He said, ""Have you ever tried eating less and exercising more? That's the ultimate?Even though we would all like it to be this simple, it is not.What I have found that is truly helpful for my patients is ""The Pathway"" by Laurel Mellin. This book and method helps people learn how to self-nurture and set effective limits that cause all excesses to fade away: overeating, overworking, overdrinking and others. This method is not a quick fix, but it has substantiated results of merit and there's still nothing to compare it to, and that includes Dr. Phil's new book."
1,I Loved It,I loved this book. I am a sucker for books that are nothing but hype and marketing. Way to go Dr. Phil. I am looking forward to his next book on how to cure premature baldness. Dr Phil. should know something about that.
1,Buy Flip the Switch Instead,"I just finished reading Dr. Phil's new book. I hoped it would provide me with the incentive that I need to lose some more weight. I had success this past winter with the book Flip The Switch by Jim Karas. He's the guy who helped Diane Sawyer and Gayle King (Oprah's best friend) lose alot of weight. And they both still look great.I lost 19 pounds with Jim's plan but then I got lazy. I still have another 10 pounds to go. I thought reading Dr. Phil's book would give me a boost. But honestly, it didn't. I am goingback to reread Flip, which by the way provides a great 7 Day Jump Start Diet Plan and includes simple to perform exercises. It worked for me once, I know it will work again.If anyone is reading this, buy Flip and get a complete program for success.Sorry Dr. Phil."
1,Old News,"There is nothing new here that has not been in every diet book since the begining of time. It just has general advice, but what I find so troubling there is no formula to follow like South Beach. This is DR ( and I use doctor loosely because he is not an MD) Phil telling people they need to lose weight. Well, gee anybody can do that."
3,It made me laugh,"Maybe I will write a book about how to be a basketball star or how to write great poetry. I will say that I am not a great basketball player and I have never ever written a wonderful poem, but if a fat guy can write about how to lose weight then anything is possible!I did not give only one star because I looked and there are interesting points he makes about a thing like spiritual wellness and balance in life. But why does he put it in a book about weight loss? It made me laugh! Stay tuned for a book on how to remain faithful to your wife by Bill Clinton!Haha!"
1,Oprah Cult Running Amok,"This guy is overweight, let's all buy his diet book. This guy is a divorcee, let's all buy his raising-a-great-family book. When this bald guy releases his eventual hair care book, let's all buy it! Why? Because Oprah says so! Yaayyyy!!!"
2,Are you kidding????!!,"Hey Dr Philly, show me your 6 pack abs and then maybe this book might be a relevant addition amongst the abundance of fad diet literature that is piling up on the coffee tables of the same overweight sexually neglected housewives that you persuade while they watch your daytime show while holding on to a bucket of Haagen-Daas. By the way, the jacket does cover up or deter from the laughable physique of a wanna-be diet guru.2 stars for brilliant marketing!"
1,More dead trees,"Are Americans really this shallow and stupid? How can they possibly buy a diet guide from a talking walrus? Is eating a balanced meal and exercising really that tough? Buy this book, and put yourself in the category of BIG DUMMY."
2,Weight advice from a fat guy???,"The key to weight loss is simple, don't eat like a fat big.The reason people are so very fat is that they stuff themselves silly and then sit down and watch TV.The best advice: get rid of your TV and eat less.You won't get that good advice from Dr. Phil, and that is the problem."
1,Grab any slimming magazine instead,"I count myself as one of Dr. Phil's biggest fans, but this book came as a huge dissappointment to me.Everything mentioned in the book is very obvious,known by any dieter and mentioned in every issue of every slimming magazine in the world? Dr. Phil, did you even thought it could be a good idea to browse through one before publishing your book?So what are the great 7 keys discovered by Dr. Phil? Here they are:# 1 Right Thinking # 2 healing feelings #3 creating a no-fail environment #4 mastery over food and impulse eating #5 high respose cost high yield nutrition # 6 Intentional exercise # 7 Support circle .What about the rest of the book? Dr. Phil uses the rest of the book to promise over and over again in every possible English sentence that if you follow those 7 keys you will lose weight.Good Luck with that!"
1,"Same old, same old. . .","I was so disappointed when I read Dr. Phil's book. Were he a diet book reader, he would have known that everything in his book has been already covered many times in other diet books. His entire message boils down to eat healthfully, exercise, get rid of tempting food, get support, think positively, become aware of emotional eating, and establish good habits. Duh!"
4,Direct and To The Point,"This book makes you look at the person who responsable for taking care of you... YOU! I am not finished with reading it yet. However, I do feel that I am building a set of tools to help me manage my health as well as my weight. Good Luck and be ready to take responsability for your past actions."
1,Are you serious?,Dr. Phil doing a book on how to lose weight? What's next? Keith Richards doing a book on how to stay away from drugs?
2,This book gave me indigestion,"I got bored halfway through the 1st chapter. I found Dr. Phil more compelling on the ""Today"" show with Katie Couric, much easier to digest than the long book form. There is some sound advice in the tome, but it is buried beneath a lot of sentences that start with ""You can.""If I had time to edit on this book, not only would it be a best seller but also easier to read and understand. There are some tables and charts that are choppy and a ""Dr Phil's body weight table"" that he has concocted from different sources and labeled as his own. As a PhD, he should know to cite his sources and references!!!There is one good tidbit in here and that is that people create/ stay in/ live a lifestyle that supports their current weight and to change that you have to ""do a makeover.""Final advice: its not the ultimate"
3,Methinks he doth protest too much!!,"Dr. Phil looks straight into the camera and swears that he is not on the national ""diet bandwagon."" However, despite his protests to the contrary, Dr. Phil is absolutely on that bandwagon with a diet book and associated eating guide, not to mention Dr. Phil's Weight Management Supplements and Dr. Phil's Shape Up! Complete Nutrition Bars sold at Walgreens. He is capitalizing heavily (no pun intended) on America's need to wake up to the fact that we are killing ourselves with refined, processed food and lack of exercise. That said - the advice in his book is sound, but not new. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you need to eat sensibly and exercise for the rest of your life (or for however long you wish to maintain a healthy weight)."
1,You Cant Be Serious,"After reading this book, I have come to this conclusion.Its nothing but common sense what he says. The fact that people are buying this and thinking its so great is scary. If you cant see how he is basically repeating the same thing that has been said since the beggining of time, I feel sorry for you. After reading all these reviews, I now fear the future of humanity."
2,Advice from a fat man,This book has very good advive and sound reasoning as usual from Dr. Phil. But I just do not think a fat man should be writing a diet book seeing he is still fat.
2,No revealing pictures,"I was disappointed in this book. I have a ""thing"" for Dr. Phil and someone told me he did a revealing thong photograph to show how his program has worked for him. No Dr. Phil in a thong, trust me. Nowhere. It's not a terrible weight loss program, but I have seen better, much better. This is typical celebrity junk. I wonder if Oprah gets a cut of the profits."
2,Why would anyone take weight loss tips from a chubby guy?,"Why would anyone take weight loss tips from a chubby guy?I really don't get it.But Dr. Phil is smart, he knows people will buy ANY book he writes."
5,Effective Content,"I am still in the midst of reading this text, but enjoy Dr. Phil's style of writing. I think the book is effective. Dr. Phil suggests seven keys for successful weight loss. Everyone can remember seven easy things, everyone. He's right about forgetting the calorie counting software. I tried it and it didn't work. I am just starting with the seven keys to weight loss mentioned in this book. I am on key five. I hope it works for me as I am very overweight right now. If you have seen Dr. Phil's TV show, it is interesting that his writing voice is exactly the same as TV voice, in my mind; helpful, caring, and smart. I recommend the read and value the content."
3,another diet book,"I love Dr. Phil, but I wish someone would write a book for us 'non-cooking' people. I know a lot of diets can help you lose weight, but you have to be able to cook or even like to cook before they do any good. I do not cook anymore, so I'm still looking for one I can use."
2,Disappointed,"I LOVE Dr. Phil so I was very disappointed that the format of this book was so hard to follow. The content is excellent....lots of good information, but in order to access the tables, the flipping back and forth is daunting. The print is too small and for one that is seriously in need of help, this is NOT the easy and quick format needed."
5,Ultimate Weight Solution: Dr. Phil,"I haven't read this cover to cover yet, but it did arrive in perfect condition. What I have started to read is definately Dr. Phil's no nonsence approach to weight issues and anything else in life."
5,Very exciting,"Similar to ""The South Beach Diet"" and Wittgenstein's ""Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"" in the sense that it attempts to achieve a weight-loss solution by scrutinizing the inner structure of our linguistic architecture and then, in a nod to Bertrand Russell and the Bloomsbury circle, ventures deep into our cultural subsconscious, challenging some of our most cherished notions and asking us perhaps that most vexing of questions, ""Should I really be ashamed of my weight at all?""--and answering with a resounding, ""You bet, you fat slob!""By the way, I prefer ""Eight Steps to Weight Loss Slavery,"" by Al Mussolini."
1,drivel,"I'd like to give this book zero stars. Dr. Phil is out of his element spewing homilies about dieting and fitness. This is an area better left to those who have the credentials to propose healthy diet and nutrician plans. Even his ""physchology"" regarding weight loss lacks any real substance. Very disappointing."
2,Not impressed,"I was hoping to hear some new and exciting health advice. I actually didn't really read it, I found myself simply skipping paragraphs......I mean, using smaller plates? This advice has been around for many years. I can find some of Dr. Phils weight loss tactics in any monthly issue of Fitness or Shape Magazine. For new and up to date proven and useful health info just log on to Weight Watchers web site for monthly eating tips and true, new and innovative health / weight loss information. Save your money . Sorry Dr. Phil :("
5,Just Great!,This book gives tells you why you overeat and how to stop. You not only the good foods but the bad ones as well. It spells it out for you (which I do need from time to time). It is a workbook as well. It is worth the reading. Used in conjuction with both the Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide and Cookbook it is more information than I have received concerning food.
2,"Close, but no cigar","Being a weight-loss counselor reading Dr. Phil's book, I found many things that I very much agree with. As I was reading, I found myself hopeful, because I think he's right-on in terms of many of the underlying reasons that we overeat. Unfortunately, however, he never actually provides the tools to do what he's asking people to do. Rather, he sticks to relying on people changing simply because now they ""know"" why they overeat, rather than providing the tools and support structure to really change those deep-down, core expectations of inadequacy that cause so many of us to overeat.Because of this shortcoming, I will continue to recommend ""The Pathway"", by Laurel Mellin, to my weight-loss clients who need more than just ""knowing"" what to do to change their fundamental beliefs about themselves in order to lose weight."
5,Lost weight; increased energy and well being,"I lost 20 lbs. and 4 inches around the waist in one month. Even better, my mental clarity was greatly sharpened, and I feel younger and more energetic than ever.Dr. Phil has a great program here. I also recommend The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide."
4,Getting Real is not pleasant,"Thank you, Dr. Phil, for your honesty. Looking at the truth of my weight, my negative attitude, and my critical self-talk are issues that you touched on in this article. Getting real with myself means taking responsibility for my over all well-being. I ordered the book and plan to start applying the principles from this article today. I am going to set a realistic weight goal for myself. I am going to take responsibility for my health. Thank you for the reasonable and generous price of these books, which helps everyone, who is ready to get real about their problem, to own these books. I weigh 205 pounds. This is not healthy for me. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with others. Sincerely yours, Ruth Landis"
4,"Fat was ""safe"".","I enjoyed Dr. Phil's no-nonsense approach to weight loss. I also discovered what was holding me back from ""getting thin"". The food I was eating wasn't the problem - the problem was within my belief system. As Dr. Phil says ""what you're not aware of, you can't fix"". Now that I ""get it"" I can fix it. So far since listening to the CD's, I've lost almost 9 lbs. in a month and will go on to lose the rest [22 lbs]. Thank you Dr. Phil."
2,Helpful? Probably. Original? No.,"I'm a little surprised that Laurel Mellin, author of The Solution and The Pathway, isn't suing for plagiarism. Yes, overweight folks need more than a ""quick fix"" and if Dr. Phil helps people get to the root causes of their obesity, swell.However, Mellin's books and her program (developed out of years of study at UCSF, where she is a professor of family medicine) are a better choice for those really looking for a way to truly deal with their inability to nurture themselves and set reasonable limits. Strong nurturing and strong limit setting are the keys to changing any behavioral excess - do yourself a favor and pick up one of her books."
1,Never received book,I sent as a gift and it was never received. I never received a tracking number to see where it went.
2,Everything Old is new Again,"I'm glad I'm not paying for the hours it took to read through this book! We always had stress in our lives, but the country is fatter than ever! My parents built bomb shelters, landed in Normandy and my classmates and I sat under our desks during nuclear bomb drills! Something else is going on in our country that has to do with what the industry has done to food; it's always been the center of family society and gatherings. If you don't know by now to get the potato chips and cupcakes out of the house if you're trying to get a hold of your eating habits, let me remind you and save you a few dollars! Calling a friend for support is a good idea, no matter what problem you have! Trust me; you already know this stuff!!"
2,Didn't keep my attention,"I don't know what it was about this book, they way it was written didn't keep my attention or help keep me motivated. I didn't get very far into it before I lost complete interest. I haven't picked it back up yet. Although I have managed to lose 20+ pounds without it."
2,Too many keys,"Since starting this diet, I have only gotten fatter and fatter. I blame Dr. Phil. He made this diet too complicated. He should have only made one key. That would be easier to follow. Then I wouldn't be so fat."
1,What a Waste,This book is a waste of time and money. Dr. Phil? much ado about nothing. Sleep will do you more good than watching or listening to him.
1,the dr. phil farce,"it makes me incredibly sad that people in america believe that dr. phil actually knows what he's talking about. he's not a MEDICAL doctor of any sort!! he has a degree in psychology, which in no way qualifies him to be doing most of the work he is doing, and in particular decieving people with his ""dr."" title on his book about eating when the ""dr"" part has nothing to do with nutrition. for anyone confused as to the difference between psychology and psychiatry... psychologists are doctors who have NO MEDICAL TRAINING! i am working towards a doctorate in history, and i will be a doctor, but if i wanted to write a book on nutrition and health, i certainly wouldnt plaster the fact that i am a dr. all over the cover of the book, nor do i plan to refer to myself as a doctor. does no one else see the sham that is doctor phil?! he's seducing america and it's a damn shame."
4,great teaching on emotional eating,"If you have ever been a victim of any abuse; physical, sexual, or emotional, Dr. Phil will start you on your way to healing. However you may need the services of a professional counselor as well. The advice on exercise, especially weight training, should be skipped. A bettter book on the best exercise for weight loss is Body by Science by Doug McGuff M.D.. The protocl is once a week, 12 minutes or less. you will get stronger and speed up your metabolism, but you will still need to diet."
2,You may need to take a psych course first.,"Sorry, but for such a critical hinge to success being 'getting in touch with this' and 'knowing pivotal things', I'm destined to fail with this book. I just don't know what he's wanting me to look for and the few answers I gave turned out to be 'what it doesn't mean'. Holy cow, he should include a copy of his psych degrees for us to borrow till we get through the program."
2,Here are my Keys to Success,"For folks of all ages: Either check this book out at your local public library......or wait a couple more months until you can buy it it used from this site at a more reasonable price.For those of us 40 and over: Get your hormones balanced! This will help immeasurably towards making you feel better and help to get rid of that ""tummy that just won't budge no matter what"".This is a wonderful book of ""inspiration"", and when you are trying to lose weight you need all the inspiration you can get. See above Key #1 to do it for less than 25 bucks!As for myself, I lost 50 lbs. on the Atkins Diet (my mother bought Dr. Phil's book and I read it). I didn't have to put a single dime into the bank account of Dr.Atkins to do it either. I just went on to his website (atkins.com) and learned everything I needed . Where is Dr. Phil's website?"
4,I hate myself for liking this show,"OK, it's shameless gratuitous self serving schlock. It's cheap and lacking in redeeming qualities - but I liked it anyway. Poor me, poor us. Order it now. bg"
5,This show is so wrong that it's right.,"First off, I plan on buying this for everyone I know. Secondly, kudos to Showtime! I subscribed for The L Word, which has been awful in Season 2, and almost cancelled until I saw Fat Actress. It's been a long time since I laughed this hard at television. This is probably the closest that American TV has come to having it's own AbFab. Just to see Blossom again! Oh, the rapture!!! No, it's not for everybody...thank the gods!"
1,Filthy dirty trashy,"This was such a disappointment! I have always loved Kirsti Alley but this series is SO FILTHY I could not watch anymore after the first 4 episodes. I watched that far in hopes that it would improve...but it did not. Why don't they hire some decent writers before putting a series into production, To simply rely on dirty language & trashy sex does NOT make a good show. I thought of dumping the discs in the nearest Goodwill box, but had second thoughts since I don't think this is worth anyone watching it...so in the trash it goes."
5,wunderfull,"Okay, while I can completely understand why most people don't like this show and that it did completely bomb, I think this show is absolutely hilarious. You just have to have that certain sense of humor to be able to understand the comedy. Yes, she is fat. Yes, she is self-asorbed. Yes, she whines and cries alot. BUT SHE'S ACTING. It's not how she really lives. It's sort of like she is doing a mockumentary on herself and she just goes over the top and has fun with it. While most people can accept this behavior in the privacy of their own homes and possibly with friends, they apparently cannot on a television show. You either hate it or love it, and I love it. It cheers me up on a rainy day and just remember, it's not for real, duh. She's just pretending it is. That's acting, planet Earth, just a different kind."
2,OMIGOD,"Okay don't get me wrong there are alot of funny parts, but seriously I was depressed watching it. I threw them both out, because I really just wanted Kirstie to workout."
5,Have the Time of you life laughing,I just love this DVD.I hope this show is picked up again.I've never laughted so hard in my life.Kirstie Alley is the Lucy Ball of 2005.
2,This is supposed to be funny???,"I had high expectations for the show. I saw the first episode on a free Showtime weekend and like it. Rented the whole season this weekend and saw that it went downhill fast! Yeah, there are funny parts, but the show quickly gets annoying. Very annoying!! I can't believe there are people that think this is good TV!! I'm not suprised that this show didn't make it."
3,The new Kirstie,Ok.... Kind of funny but... she's making a fool of her self! For real! She's fat but so what?? This is so beneath her....
1,sexist terminology - poor story line,I ordered this dvd series because I liked Kristy Alleys performance in other movies and series. But this is totally different. A lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted. After viewing two episodes I put it in the trash. Watching this does not make me happy.
1,This show sucks!!,I wouldnt even give this 1 star if I had a choice. There were a few funny moments but for the most part I was so bored I almost fell asleep while watching every episode. Definetly not worth buying cause you'll never watch it again anyway.
3,Give this a try BUT...,"A group of friends and I got together and did Tae Bo in college. We started with the basics and worked our way up to this advanced tape. It is excellent, but keep in mind that you should start with the instructional and basics video FIRST so as not to shock or injure your body. The tape is vigorous and a few friends (including me after a few tries) decided to stick with the basics until we are ready for this serious and intense advanced workout. With both sets of videos, you can't go wrong."
4,great workout,"The video was quite impressive. It is a real full workout. Though it is called advanced, the technique of the moves wasn't all that difficult. However, the exercises are intense, therefore you can certainly get your heart rate going. When he moves on to the next exercises, he shows the moves slowly once, and you get to try them out slowly several times before he picks up the pace. All the moves are well expained and easy to comprehend. This video is strongly recommended and I would certainly try out the Tae-bo Live as well."
1,hard on your body,There are going to be a lot of hurt bones on this one.It may be a lot of fun to do but fast punches and kicks on the body will show up as joints out of place
4,"Please, Please, Please create another video.","I think some of the others were a little harsh. I mostly do the Basic workout. I love it. So far I can only get through half of the Advanced workout. If you don't weigh 190 pound are are in better shape you will have a blast. I really hope Billy Blanks will create a Tae Bo workout between the Basic and the Advanced. I think alot more pounds will be dropping off.Cindy, Calif."
4,This video is the great-full body workout!,"I bought the basic video about three weeks ago and decided to try the advanced. Boy did my muscles hurt the next day, almost to the point I wanted to cry! But then I though, yes no pain no gain (or in this case loss) These muscles hadn't hurt in a long time-I've consistently worked out for the past three years and my body won't take the shape I want it to. I hope this works. It was frusterating the first time to do the video, couldn't even make it through, but I WILL DO IT! Can't wait to see how much fun I know I will have. And for those pounds to come off!"
5,"FOR THOSE OF US THAT BORE EASILY, FINALLY A REAL WORKOUT!","Finally a workout that is as exciting as it is motivating! The workout is extremely hyped up and the results are more than anyone could ever expect! My sister lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks, my brother lost 16 lbs!! I was skeptical because I bore easily with most workout tapes. Lo and Behold!!! Billy Blanks comes on the scene and the exercise industry will never be the same. Tae-bo is for everybody, not just a certain body! Join in, learn from the master and you won't believe how quick it happens for you!"
4,Tough but worth the effort,"I hate aerobics, but I love this workout! After doing the basic tape for six weeks, I decided to try the advanced one. I laughed through it the first time, because it was so ridiculously hard, but after a few more workouts, I was keeping up really well. Yes, the camera work is totally cheesy, but it makes the whole workout a lot more light-hearted. Part of the fun is watching for the editing errors. Also, I LOVE the fact that the people who made the basic tape look so easy are really suffering through it. Some folks stop for air and water, all except the psychotically fit woman in the front in the blue outfit who claps and whoops after every exercise set. She is AWESOME! I have only lost a few pounds, but I have a totally new body. This is one workout that is well worth the effort, and the tapes are worth every penny."
3,Tae Bo Live! Sneak Preview,"I felt ripped off. Not really a full workout. It's 20 minutes long, with clips from several different videos and a running commercial across the bottom of the screen for those videos. I use it as a warm up before lifting weights. But it's not enough on its own."
5,FUN!! Makes you get off the couch & kick some serious butt!!,"Unfortunately for me, exercise videos have always bored me senseless and then I'd turn it off and go back to the couch long before I should. But with the Tae-Bo tapes, I WANT to exercise, and I do, I go through both tapes in one ""session"" and I still want MORE [after I catch my breath ;)]!!!! Before these tapes, I absolutely HATED to exercise, but now...I LOVE IT!!! Every word that I've written is 110% true, if you don't believe me, HONESTLY try it for a week- You WILL change you mind! Take it from an EX-couch potato (who could have gone pro ;P)...TRY IT!!!"
5,BEST WORKOUT YOULL FIND,"I am in the best shape of my life! Taebo is so fun and inspiring that you will look forward to it every day. Before you do Advanced be SURE you have done Basic and Instructional, if you havent you will probably get lost, hurt yourself, and most likely wont even be able to fininsh it. The Live preview is great for just before dinner if you want to burn off one or two hundred calories. I did Tae bo every day for a couple months and noticed a big difference in my body and fitness. Be careful to mix it up with other things too-- I got shin splints when i didn't do that."
2,It will make you sweat but thats not good enough.,"Tae Bo is a good workout, but lacking in many respects. The warmup is inadequate which would not be a problem if he told you to warmup on your own.Billy does a horrible job with his cues. He should being using his right for our left and vice-versa but he doesn't. He miss counts several times also.While this workout does make you sweat it is lacking in terms of his ability to teach an exercise class. And some of the moves in the warmup are unsafe. I.E. neck roll.For a great workout try Intense Moves by Reebok a step workout taught by Gin Miller that will quick your butt. It is also taught very well."
5,An electrifying kick-butt WORKOUT!,"I,ve been doing Billy Blank's advanced Tae Bo workout for about two months now and I am really pleased with the results I am seeing. The video is easy to follow once you've accomplished the instructional basic workout. The advanced workout is very exciting and it definately kicks butt. The music is less desirable, but the people working out with Billy Blank are inspiring to watch and follow. The video offers lots of fun, challenging combinations with high energy kicks and punches. I feel like I'm not only getting aerobic exercise, but am also learning some self defense techniques. Tae Bo advance is a great overall body toning and aerobic exercise. I thrive on the program and look forward to this three times a week alternative workout that enhances my running program."
3,Mistakes happen,"I'm sure the Tae-Bo Advanced workout is good , but I never received it. They kind of made a mistake. The sneak preview I did receive. It's ok , but you can't workout to it. Tape was in good condition."
2,Fun workout - TOO MUCH $$ for the poor production quality.,"These tapes are really a lot of fun, but I cannot believe that I paid >all this $$ for this! I've seen $7 tapes with the same quality production. The Firm videos are works of art and you get much quicker results. (Not to mention being ten times safer!) As the TaeBo tapes progress, you cannot hear Billy talking - the music gets louder while his voice gets softer and you find yourself trying to read lips while you're sweating and breathing heavily! Don't they watch the videos after they're done editing?! Tons of fun for $10 - not tons of fun for this price."
5,Pumping Music,"Love the music in this latest series of Tae=bo workouts! Feel like ""Rocky"" when Im pumping. Keep them coming, Billy. They're getting better and better- I'm managing to keep up and feel like a million.."
1,Unhappy with purchase,I think Billy Blanks is highly overrated. I bought his videos and they are a joke. I thought that his videos would be different from all the other workout videos. I can tell you they were not. The guy seriuosly needs to get real. They are not worth the money.
3,OK,"One of the things that my husband loves about me is that I adore action movies. He never has to ""convince"" me to watch a film that has lots of violence. Actually, I am usually the one to initiate such movies. We watched Hunted By Night last night and it was exactly what I was expecting. Drugs, action and a hunt. The acting was decent and the plot was pretty straight forward. It did seem to lull in certain spots but picked back up pretty quickly.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this movie for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own. Affiliate links are used in this post."
2,For B-movie action lovers,"I rented this because i liked the description on the box (based in part on a true story that happened to the director). It's an ok little actioner with religious overtones, that could have benefited from being a little shorter. It's got nice stunts, the woodland setting is atmospheric and the actors do their jobs. On the downside, it begins to feel muddled and flat toward the end."
3,A strange little story about a boy's coin,"The story of Arthur and his guinea is set in colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. Arthur, as any young boy would do, is digging around for hidden treasure when he comes upon this treasured coin. He never shows it to anyone for fear that he may be made to spend it. Arthur seems to dote on the coin, secretly looking at its brilliance in the sunlight and its shine in the candlelight before bedtime. Arthur eventually loses the coin during play and eventually has luck and finds it. He chooses to let everyone know of the coin's existence and his mother lets him keep his treasure.I'm not quite sure if there is a moral here. Perhaps it comes down that all of us hold certain things special and that we should be allowed to do so. If that is the lesson, I'm not sure any young person would immediately pick up on it."
3,Picture Book or Recipe Book?,"I bought this book because I wanted step-by-step instructions and I like to see a picture of the finished product. In this respect, the book is a success. However, I was confused by the hodge-podge way the text, ingredients and procedures were presented. The photographs were not as helpful as I had hoped and the lay out very artsy. Please note there is no Nutrition Information Per Serving available. And don't forget to stock up on oil. My suggestion is to try a different book, unless you need something pretty for your coffee table. It did make me realize that I really should buy some more festive dishes"
3,Author's objection!,"This book is most certainly NOT about hundreds of soldiers in the desert who struggle to rejoin a battle, as your editor's synopsis says! I wrote the book, so I ought to know. This book is part of a survival series written for older elementary school children, about how one might survive in different ecosystems, if s/he were stranded. Each book opens with a short version of a real-life survival story, but that's merely a ""warm-up"" to the material, and only the first chapter. Where did you ever get that synopsis from?!"
1,Wake me up when it's over........,"What happened?.....I opened this book, read the first chapter, and woke up 7 years later with a very impressive beard. While it is inevitable that books of this type are unlikely to be a thrilling roller-coaster ride, Mr Rosenthal has succeeded in sterilizing the sterile, neutering the neutered, and creating possibly the least interesting work since ""A Brief History of Toilet Roll Holders,"" and the follow-up opus, ""A Toilet Roll Holding History of Briefs."" Read this book only in emergencies, when you are concerned that your life is just way too enjoyable."
2,"useless stuff, but earnest","Phew. Judging by this book, Merton was a much better person than he was a writer. Maybe I went into this book expecting too much, but I finished the book utterly unimpressed with what it had to say. It boils down to a series of very discrete strategies for living one's life in a loving and satisfying way. I can't really ``disagree'' with it--yeah sure, ok, love is good, uh-huh--but that doesn't stop me from wishing Merton were a lot more explicit and rigorous in his prescriptions. As it stands, I don't know how anyone could possibly profit from reading this touchy-feely manifesto."
3,Simple (yet endearing) adult fairy tale,"In her first piece of full-length fiction (more of a novella than a novel), Eudora Welty has taken a Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the same title, set it along the Natchez Trace in Mississippi, added a couple of legendary Southern outlaws (including the notorious Harp Brothers, one of whom is represented only by his severed head), and stirred in a good measure of Southern humor. The result is a wickedly funny (if slight) adult fantasy, complete with the usual cast: a beautiful young girl, a stepmother, and a good number of Disneyesque dimwits. There are no hidden meanings or surprise plot twists--this is just a fanciful yarn cleverly told with great wit and style."
4,Patricia Sosa - 1990 album,"Era un corazón heridoHistoria sin finalSon juegos de amorRito y castigoCantaDame una señalLas palabras duelen másHas perdido fascinaciónNo te vayas, alma míaMe estás rompiendo el corazónPara amarte una vez másViento del este"
3,Disappointing clatter,"I'm not a newcomer to Say, and picked up this disc - without previewing it - on the strength of marvellous earlier performances in a wide range of repertoire (Bach, Mozart, Gershwin, Stravinsky).Sadly, I found little to commend these performances other than their virtuosity. I got a headache both times that I played this disk, and there won't be a third. <ouch>"
1,All technique - no music,"I bought this CD after visiting a rather weak concert performance of Waldstein. The pianist in question just didn't manage the technical difficulties. Knowing Fazil Say is a virtuoso I wanted to hear a new and technically perfect version. For sure that's what I got. Fazil plays everything in the speed of light and is technically brilliant but I find the result absolutely terrible. I can't stand it, after two of the sonatas I had to stop. I'll miss his version of ""The Tempest"" since I won't ever be able to put this record on again. I can't understand what he's doing. It's like he wants to win a contest of playing ""Appassionata"" and ""Waldstain"" as fast as possible. There's no depth in this recording, the touch is hollow and thin and he just hammers on lika a maniac. He gets one star for playing so fast. He gets the gold medal. He can join the olympics."
2,Get a clumping litter instead,"I got this litter thinking it was the Fresh Step clumping litter, and I was extremely disappointed. The litter is so big it hardly fit through the holes in my scoop. Moreover, because it did not clump, it was very difficult to remove the urine and started to smell awful after a few days. It also stuck to the bottom of the litter box. I have 2 cats, and I clean it once a week, but still it was gross. It was also very dusty. I highly recommend another litter."
5,Great Salsa/Spanish Guitar CD,Upbeat Spanish Guitar/Salsa/Mediterranean music that will have you moving and tapping your feet to the beat. A great mate to his Mediterranean Nights CD!
5,The Beauty of the Hat,"This is a remarkable little book. This is a beautiful little book. I suppose it is out of print because hat-loving is such a niche market. But hat lovers everywhere would love this book. The hat is such an expression of style and dignity, and this book captures it in a totally charming way. Wow, what a book."
4,The Hat As An Object Of Art,"This attractive, artsy book comes with a grosgrain hat trim book mark. Its black and white photographs, poems, hat ditties from literature and essays treat the hat as an object of art. For example: ""Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her: If you can bounce high, bounce for her too, ""Till she cry Lover, gold-hatted, high bouncing lover, I must have you"" F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby."
3,Running for School Board?,"This book was published in 1988 by the American Freedom Coalition and distributed through workshops for school board candidates. How do I know? I wrote the book. It has a strong conservative agenda influenced by AFC that was popular in the 80s. The book focuses mostly on the rights of parents and local control and has great research on the constitutional rights of parents by a constituional lawyer. If you are running for school board - it has some great ideas for success. I should know - I won my election by 53% and went on to be an appointed lobbyist for the National School Boards Association. I plan on re-writing it to make it a little less ""dramatic."" But hey - I was young and it was my first book. Upset with your local school board? Discover what you can do about it."
5,The Astro Zombies,"If You Love Psychobilly this is a must have cd, every song is great, if you dont like it dont buy it, but i know youll buy it cause this is the best psychobilly cd around!"
5,So I figured it out...but I was still blown away,I've rarely been on the edge of my seat watching a tv show. I found Harper's Island by accident - looking for something with Christopher Gorham in it - and will never regret spending my weekend watching this show. I missed it the first time around being overseas at the time...and though I figured the mystery 4 episodes before the end...I kept praying that I was wrong. Harper's Island is a treat. A real treat...and absolutely LOVED it!
5,Hit with the teens.,I bought this for my teenage daughter's group of friends to watch. They like to get together and watch scary movies. They really got into this series. I heard lots of screams and laughs. They told me it was intense. One of the group couldn't take wait to finish the series and had to google the end! Great buy.
5,Suspense at its best!!!,This is a great series!!! I loved it so much on TV that I had to buy the DVD series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. I highly recommend this show!!!
5,Watch This!,"When Harper's Island was first on tv I thought it looked good so I decided I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did!!! Harper's Island is one of the best shows I have ever seen! It has everything that a good thriller movie has. It has twists and turns, suspense, mystery that keeps you guessing and the suprises don't stop until the end. Harper's Island is definatly and great addition to my ever growing dvd collection. Seriously, Harper's Island is a MUST HAVE!!! =]"
1,why display this when you can't actually get it and have no idea when?,"I don't get it, why ""offer"" these when you can't actually get them nor can you know when you actually may get them? Harpers Island has been on for months, and amazon still can't provide them for watching... I've checked here last month, and nothing's changed. What's the hold-up?"
2,Are you kidding me???,I don't want to ruin this for anyone but this show breaks too many of the murder mystery rules and for a 13 hour show...that just makes me mad. In a murder mystery you can't say here is the killer at the end of disc 10 when they never been introduce on screen before that...that's just shady business. Ten hours of red herrings that lead nowhere only to find out we've been pulled around blindly for ten hours. Half the cast has disappeared and finally someone thinks something might be wrong. All of that would have been forgiven if it hadn't been for the ridiculous last disc where all is reveled. My eyes were rolling back in my head with ever silly ass discovery and the ending was just plain lame. Thanks for the attemp but come on...
2,Harper's Island,One critic claimed that in Harper's Island Scream meets And Then There Were None. It was disappointing. It was the writing that killed Harper's. It was simply bad to the bone! The story had no ending except for one maniac killing another maniac. So all the clues were simply red herrings. That's too bad but they insisted upon the maniacs. They could have developed an interesting story line e.g. a fight over a wealthy estate between two parties but they simply refused to work on the plot. Is it any wonder why the characters look stupid? This series depends upon suspense and gimmicks. Except for the maniacs the leads look like morons. Was it a horror show or a detective thriller? Don't buy it.
2,My thoughts.,"I watched the show. It was enjoyable. Once more however, the CBS bosses moved its airdate after 2 or 3 episodes. Then they give 0 explanation why other shows such as Without a Trace didn't get past Season 2 on DVD.Along with Eleventh Hour & Close to Home never released. I understand it's about ratings. But bad ratings or not. DVD/Blu-Ray are the newest media.Get with it Mr. Leslie Moonves."
1,It's not free!! ?? !!,"Amazon say's its 0.00 but when looking at the preview or when I click to watch it, it says there a fee 1.99 per episode. Why would anyone want to pay per episode when you can rent the whole season for a few bucks?"
2,Boring!,"The show could be so good, but unfortunately you know from the beginning who the killer is. It really spoils the pleasure. And he is the most ugliest and ungifted leading man in a recent history of TV."
4,Nice tv series,This was a really good series that reminded me of the story Ten Little Indians but the ending was pretty weak. I still liked it though. It was fun to try and guess who would be killed next.
4,Great show,"The plot was amazing. The actors did an amazing job. The direction, location, and murder scenes were smashing. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat. My only problem was the ending, that final episode. Quoted by my boyfriend, ""The writer must have been an only child to come up with such an ending, because siblings are not sexually attracted to each other"". In my opinion, the writers could have easily made anyone else be the killer and it would still have been believable. But don't let that deter you. The ending does make sense and everything fits together. So basically, keep an open mind. The show is great and very entertaining."
3,would be 5 stars,"I love the series, but its missing episodes btwn discs! That's a bit aggravating since the next disc u put in shows the previous episode."
3,long and convoluted,It seemed way too drug out to me. Also it seemed as is the makers tried way too hard to obscure the 'bad guy'. My husband would have rated it 4 stars - one star off for unlikely stupidity at the end of the series. I would NOT recommend it but my husband WOULD. Depends on your preferences.
1,Awful,"This show could have been good, but every week it gets worse. Haprer's Island is very unrealistic, one example being the island is huge but there is only one sherif that does anything, I think that there is two more that stay at the jail the whole time you would think this island had a major serial killer years before that there would be more protection than one sherif. Also the killer kills state troopers but no one even comes to investigate or look for them. Their are other expamples but I will not go into them because I dont want to ruin the show for anyone else that might watch."
3,who-dun-it,"I loved it from start to ... well, almost finish. I couldn't wait to get my dvd set and start watching - again. Of course I watched it on tv, suffered through commercials etc. I thought it started to fall apart in the next to last show but it really hit the bottom on the last episode. Oh, well. I watch it like some other of my favorites, and when it gets to the end, I stop the movie. Don't even watch the ending anymore. Of course, Harper's Island had a decent ending, if you like girl gets boy, finally."
4,"It's a 4 Disc Set, not a single disc","The info is wrong.It's a 4 disc set, which would indicate lots of extras/extended scenes and hopefully MORE GORE!!!!"
5,Harpers Island ROCKS,"Just finished watching the finale and this show was amazing. I was originally concerned with the pre-reviews saying too bloody for the Agatha Christie crowd not bloody enough for the Friday the 13th crowd. Well what about the crowd that just appreciates a well written murder mystery. The characters were all very endearing. The story grew darker each week. The ""soap opera"" element only helped to create characters that the viewer cared about. Alot of the deaths were creative and the plot twists were intriguing. Ultimately, the payoff was tense and thrilling. I can hardly wait to rewatch this excellent show on dvd. Thank you to CBS for airing this outstanding show!"
3,Fear the Island,"I had looked forward to this show ever since I saw the first advertisements on TV and I made sure to tune in every week. I expected a mystery show full of grisly murders and I got just that, though the killer's identity isn't one that you can figure out until they finally decide to throw it in your face. In other words, putting clues together is a waste of time. While it's fun, entertaining at times and full of beautiful people, there just isn't enough substance to stretch over 13 episodes. If some filler was cut and they got it down to around 8 episodes, it would probably be a better show for it. I love the horror genre, but these people made the folks in most horror movies look bright. I found myself shaking my head at least four or five times per episode at the stupidity I was witnessing. If you want a really good horror show, check out Supernatural, but Harper's Island isn't a bad way to kill some time."

4,"Informative, light reading. A very relaxing book.","I found this book to be really easy to read. Author is not getting into too much detail, he is telling stories, not a thriller. You don't have to have any martial arts background to understand these stories, they are like fairy tales, but more realistic.In my opinion this book is well written and put together, a very nice collection of stories. A few pictures would not spoil this book."
3,Book is for younger kids,"The story line of Buddy Is A Stupid Name for a Girl was great, but at some points it got very boring. Though, I never wanted to put it down with all the suspense. This book might not be enjoyable for most young adults, but more for elementary kids."
3,"A colorful, literate, and imaginative collection","Tom La Farge, who wrote the unconventional two-volume fantasy ""The Crimson Bears,"" has retold a series of French fables and fabliaux, mostly based on the work of Marie de France, in ""Terror of Earth."" La Farge's retellings -- sometimes antique in manner, sometimes slyly postmodern -- are notable for their striking imagery (a fisherman spying upon his own cuckolding notices that the seducer's hand makes his wife's breast ""leap like a flexible pearl"") The title story, my own favorite, deftly plays off the old story of the kite that fouled the jay's nest; it brings together a cacophony of birds' voices (""My most beloathed darling, I fly to you as to the corpse on which I am compelled by my ghoulish nature to feed,"" writes the vulture to his beloved), and can be fairly said to do for the Parliament of Birds rather what Pamela Zoline once did for ""Sheep."""

4,Excellent metal music!,"Death were the first (and quite possibly the best) true death metal band. They're amazing in every way, and how they've progressed over the years is mind-boggling, beginning with the immature ""Scream Bloody Gore"" and gradually building up to the immeasurable masterpiece ""Symbolic"".Anyway, this album is awesome. The lyrics are purely poetic, the guitar riffs are incredible (though they often get a little carried away), Chuck's voice is at its best, and the basslines are INSANE. Really, Steve DiGiorgio is an animal! Unfortunately, the relatively poor production makes Gene Hoglan's drumming sound automated and repetitive, but his time will come. If you've heard ""Symbolic"", or SYL's ""City"", you'll know what I mean. I'd also recommend their last album, ""The Sound of Perseverence"", which combines elements of all of their albums.Other than that, Rest In Peace Chuck Schuldiner. There's a place in every true metal lover's heart for you."
5,Awe-Inspiring.,"This little masterpiece will remain Chuck Schuldiner's finest moment-- playing the most inspired music of his life while prodding a bona fide all-star lineup to surpass themselves (!). There isn't anything I could say about this album that could make the experience more interesting-- it doesn't need it anyway. If nothing else, ignore the reviews on this page and do yourself a favor and buy it. You'll be proud you did. Anyone who can't appreciate this wonder is either a fool or stone deaf."
5,A Wonderful Album With A Wonderful Lineup,"Everything about Individual Thought Patterns is just pure amazing. The sheer production, wonderfully written lyrics, killer music, and most off all, the dream lineup. On this album you've got both vocalist Chuck Shuldiner and Andy LaRocque on guitars, Steve DiGiorgio on bass, and of course Gene Hoglan on drums. Schuldiner and LaRocque were just a freakin guitar team on this album, the solos are just mindblowing they make you smile. Steve DiGiorgio's bass work is just awesome throughout especially on track 3 Jealousy, and of course Gene Hoglan's double bass drumming just keep your pulse pounding all the way. Best songs are Jealousy, Mentally Blind, Overactive Imagination, hey the entire album is just great, and if you're a fan, then Individual Thought Patterns is an absolute must have in your collection. Death Rules, R.I.P Chuck!"
5,BB is a dead man!,"How dare you disrespect the greatest band ever!! You disrespect Chuck Schuldiner, you disrespect metal! If you slam Death one more time, I will find you, and dismember you inways unimaginable!!! BB can go f**k a cow."
3,A Strange Death Album......,"This album is strange because, well, sometimes I love it and sometimes I don't. I know that the music and the lyrics are done well and vocals don't fall during the album but,.....thats just me. I think you, reader, should try this album but, be warned by it's odd traits such as the album seems to fall away from Death Metal and become a strange child of Heavy Metal and small touchs of Doom Metal. Overall, I say you should buy it but, be warned."
3,Not good enough,"Death is an OK band, not as great as some of these reviews say, but not as bad as say, Slipknot. But THE best death metal CD of all time still has to be ""Metal Machine Music"" by Lou Reed, and this doesn't compare. No Death, In Flames, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Korn, Slayer or Slipknot music can to this day compare with the ULTIMATE, ""Metal Machine Music."" So listen to your third-rate Death after that."
5,The Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About,"The Seven Myths of Gun Control accomplishes what gun prohibitionists have always feard. A book that clearly explains to the masses the fraud and deceit behind the ""gun control"" agenda. Simply put, this book tells you facts and information gun prohibitionists and their media allies don't want you to know.Aaron Zelman, Executive Director, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, Inc."
4,Well the neg reviewers are wrong,"Fortunately for second amendmant supporters we finally got a republican in the whitehouse. The first thing the new A.G. John Ashcroft did, was have written into public record that the justice dept. official position is the 2nd amendmant protects an INDIVIDUAL's right to own gun's. You'll never change anyones mind about this issue, but buy this book if you want to make an intelligent argument with an anti-freedom(gun) advocate."
2,Use your head,"We should support rational gun regulations. If we just oppose any law with the word ""gun"" in it, we just hurt our cause. Books like this don't have any grasp of real life. I didn't disagree with everything Poe said, but Poe clearly is more interested what he wishes was true and less interested in what is true. He has the same warped mentality as those who just want to ban any gun.""It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."
1,Unfortunately most of it is not true,"Most of his arguments are very superficial. It is for example a fact, that in countries like Germany, France, Japan or even Canada, the homicide rates carried out by guns are 10 times, yes, 10 times lower than in the US. In all of this countries it is almost impossible to get a gun. He writes for example about the Swiss militia. This Winter a gunmen entered the Swiss parliament killing over a dozen people, never happend in Germany, never happend in Japan. Wake up! All his arguments are lame excuses for carrying a gun.He's right about the criminals, though. If you want to kill someone, you gonna kill him anyway, but how much easier is it to kill if you have a gun instead of knife!?This book is defintely a shot in the wrong direction."
5,Well done popularized version of earlier work,"This book is a fast read, and it serves a useful niche taking the research done by others and presenting the work in such a way that it is easily understood by a wide audience. While the book addresses second amendment issues, the biggest emphasis is on how gun control increases crime. It is on this last point that the book relies very, very heavily on John Lott's More Guns, Less Crime and his op-ed pieces. Even though I had read Lott's book, I hadn't read some of his op-ed pieces, so I still got something out of even this discussion. I also think that Poe does a good job of simplifying some of Lott's discussions. My bottom line: is that Poe's book is still a valuable addition to Lott's book."
4,Thoughtful,"This book makes you think. Which in itself is worth at least a three star rating. After making you think this book gives you facts. Not emotion, but the honest truth about guns. The only place it falls short is right at the end, and for that I dock it a star.If you own a gun...read this bookIf you are thinking about owning a gun...read this bookIf you ""hate"" guns...read this bookIf you ""hate"" guns and make a living off persuading other people to ""hate"" like you...then try a differnet book. Because this one sells truth not the stuff you make you living off of."
4,A Must Read,"In the past, I tacitly believed many of these myths. If youbelieve any of these statements, then you must read this book:- Guns increase violent crime- Pulling a gun on a criminal endangers you more than the criminal- Guns pose a special threat to kids- The 2nd Amendment applies only to miliamen- The 2nd Amendment is obsolete- We should treat guns as cars, requiring licenses- ""Reasonable"" gun control is not a threatThe author writes in an easy-reading style, working in statisticsas well as many anecdotes. If you haven't thought deeplyabout these issues and your opinion has been shaped by themainstream media, then you MUST read this. Everybodyelse should read it anyway -- no matter which side of the fenceyou are on."
5,Awesome,"A great book for those that may have problems getting into John Lott's book. A clear step by step argument that gun control has nothing to do with crime control, but people control."
4,A great read,"This book is a great simple read that tells you the real facts about gun control. It exposes the anti guns crowds myths. Just like Lott'S ""more guns, less crime"" it shows you the real facts about guns, not the distorted liberal media's coverage on this matter. Read this book if you want to see the real facts about the gun debate."
3,"Good, but not great","Apart from the occasional person who pops up to give this book one star and vehemently advocate trigger locks, no one is going to read this book except the people who agree with Mr. Poe. His views on the seven myths are probably right. I say ""probably"" because he only cites people who agree with him. When he uses an occasional quote from a dissenter, the reader has no idea what the context is. It seems like he often takes a few words from another's work and expands them to fit the assumptions he uses. He also has an annoying tendency of stating his argument, giving us a singular example supporting his argument, and concluding that his argument is obviously right. Does this make him wrong? No, but it probably makes him a bad writer. For this reason, his book will serve only as assurance to us gun owners and want-to-be gun owners that we are correct. He is not going to change anyone's mind or even sway someone who is on the fence."
1,"Very Cheap materials, this item will be returned!!","the product details are very misleading. I was expecting a better quality product considering the price I paid ( even at the discount price I paid $34.00 including the shipping. The materials are 90% plastic and maybe 10% metal ( unidentified metal) all held together by two strands of what appears to be a mixture of rubber and thread. The feel of it alone reminds of a cheap bracelet you would get out of a 50 cent vending machine, the 10% metal being the cheer charms but the painted skirt, shirt and poms is plastic paint. I can't believe how dissapointed I was in this product, was suppose to be a christmas gift to my niece. I could pay equally this amount on a better quality charm bracelet from Brighton."
5,Recommended for beginners on a budget,"First of all I should note that this is an interactive CD Rom, not a book. It is however based on the Sybex text of the same title. I recommend using this product in conjunction with MCSE Windows 2000 Pro. for Dummies. I found they complimented each other rather well, as the Dummies book was based more on the Authors real world experience as opposed to the CD's facts and figures. The CD features an array of practice questions, assessment tools and of course interactive animation. The only downside to the product is that it is riddled with spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and the occasional misprint. Overall, I found this product to be of great benefit. If you're looking for value for money, I strongly recommend adding this item to your shopping basket (but don't put all your eggs in the same basket, especially if you're new to MCSE)."
5,This is not a book.,"This is a computer program. I tried doing a search through software and it would not show up. While it is great to have this under books for searches, and I agree it should be there to, but first and formost this book should show up under a software search."
2,Watch band fades fast,"I purchased this watch and I loved it. However, within 2 months of use (not in the shower) The band faded to a really ugly blue and gray color. I tried to replace the band and still cannot find the replacement. The watch works great though and I am still looking for a band. If anyone has any suggestion, let me know"
1,"Nice collection, not origonal recordings","This was everything I could remember and a few I forgot by Roger Miller and although the recordings are really good they are not the single 45 versions I remember. In most cases they are better recordings, but just not the same."
2,kinda disappointed,I'm kind of disappointed with this product. It's low quality and when it came it was alittle bent up. I wasn't really happy with this product. I will probably shop for another one eventually.
2,donut cutter,This is a cheap product. The center piece does not stay attached and falls off. I do not recomend this product.
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"As a big fan of mountaineering literature, I have read many, many climbing books. This one stands head and shoulders above the rest. Full of copious amounts of factual detail, yet still able to keep a fascinating story moving along. I still keep going back to it months later, just to check facts or to re-read different parts. GREAT BOOK"
5,For those who dare to dream,This is the ultimate book for the armchair mountaineer...the person who has a deep and abiding love for the natural and awe inspiring majesty of the great Mount Everest...but who realises in his/her heart that they may never have the chance to even set eyes on this mountain in their lifetime.Unsworth provides such a vivid and detailed account of the modern history of Everest mountaineering that the reader feels as if he is actually there as part of the expedition...a feat that only the very exceptional and meticulous writer can ever hope to accomplish.Trust me...once you start reading...it is very difficult to put it down.Definitely a 5 star.
3,Exhausting Everest,"Walt Unsworth's history of Everest is certainly comprehensive. One might say exhaustive. Every attempt on the world's highest mountain from the pre-war British expeditions (which are covered in great detail) to the commercial climbs of the 1990s (which are not) are recorded and put in context. When it comes to climbing history, I doubt that this weighty tome can be bettered. My only gripes are that the ordering of the history (not strictly chronological) is a little difficult to follow - unless one reads the whole 700+ pages in order, and, although admittedly meant as a mountaineering history, there could have been more geographical detail on the features of the mountain (though the maps of ascent routes are very good), and there could have been more analysis of individual acheivements and the thorny issues that have surrounded climbing. Conclusion: brilliant encyclopedia; a little short on criticism."
5,"Romance, magic and love's mysterious ways...","Magical, like heated summer breeze through a grove of spice trees. It warms your heart, gets your juices racing through your veins, as those secret movements of nature mischievously orchestrates a symphony. All the while your tongue imagining the sweet taste of chocolate melting in your mouth, if only it could be one of HER creations."
3,Pleasant but...,"I don't really know what to think of this book. True, it is a sensuous experience at times with its wonderful descriptions of the chocolate-making process. However, having lived in a small French village for six years now, I find the description of village life a little too twee and ""touristy"". A real village priest would never have the power that the one in the book has (at the start of the novel anyway). And the village itself is a little too idealised. Most of the people in my village would never be able to afford Vianne's chocolates. There again, the back-stabbing atmosphere of a small French village is spot-on. Read it but don't expect to find Lansquenet on your next trip to France."
2,I wanted to love this novel but...,"I found this book simplistic, naive, and heavy-handed. It would have been better with more complex and ambiguous characters."
3,Gypsys and chocolate,quick ans easy read. Enjoyed the setting and the battle between chocolate and the catholic church. Enjoyed it but it left a little to be desired.
5,A sensory delight.,"A great first novel, that compares with Laura Esquivel,s "" Like water for chocolate "" in ever department.The best book of 99 so far."
3,a semi-sweet book,"This book is the story of Vianne Rocher, a single mother who is quite eccentric and opens a choclate shop in a very conservative small village. The local priest is quite nuts and sees her as a disruption to his devout congregation. There are lovely descriptions of chocolates and some surprising turns in this story. A pleasant read, nothing too complicated. Don't read if you love chocolate and are on a diet."
4,Charming and sweet,"""Chocolat"" is the story of a mysterious woman, Vianne Rocher, who moves to a small French village with her young daughter in tow. Vianne quickly establishes a small chocolate shop in town, which creates more excitement than the village has seen in years. While many residents welcome the new establishment, the local reverend, Père Reynaud, sees Vianne's chocolate shop as a slap in the face to the church and to morality in general. When Vianne plans to hold an elaborate chocolate festival in conjunction with Easter Sunday, the reverend becomes enraged and vows that she must be stopped at all costs.This is a fun little novel that includes elements of magic and sorcery. It's a quirky book with memorable characters, and although it does drag a bit in places, it was an enjoyable read that I would recommend."
5,Good book.,"Having seen the movie and really liking it, I thought I'd read the kindle book. Very glad I did. It varied greatly from the movie like so many books made into movies do. It was a magical movie based on a magical book, but the book gives you a bigger window on humanity's good and bad characteristics where the movie gave more of a sugar coated version. I will keep this one on my device to read over and over."
5,Chocolat,Great movie and great bookLoved itAbsolutely the greatest book everlol what else can i say it was great
5,This book is amazing,"Nothing will ever equal ""Chocolat"" for its sensuality and appeal. Having successfully mixed some pagan traditions with the catholic religion, I can appreciate this sort of magic."
2,"Disappointing, superficial characters and plot lines","I read this for a book club, and as a chocolate fiend, was excited. While it was a quick read, how many cups of hot chocolate can you hear described? The characters were poorly developed and therefore, one dimensional; I was never able to picture any of them. The narrator Vianne, was not likeable, but rather, self righteous and unnessarily provocative of the mores of the town. Although I am not a Catholic, I found the church-bashing outmoded and hard to take. All in all, a mediocre novel."
2,"It's been done, and it's been done better","I'm not sure what all the hoopla and fanfare was about--Chocolat was not a good book. I'm not faulting its magical realism genre of ""Delectable Food Induces Amorous Affairs."" It just wasn't written very well. While reading this book, not a moment passed where I didn't get hit with de ja vu. Even the ending was foreseeable--and the reason definitely is not b/c I've got this great prophet-like power--it's simply that the author does absolutely nothing new with this concept. This terrain has been mapped far better in other works. Think Isabelle Allende's ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or the wonderful movies, ""Tampopo"" and ""Eat Drink Man Woman."""
5,A lovely story,"In these times of intolerance, this story has a lesson for all of us. I didn't want to put it down and when it ended, I missed these characters. Well-written, eminently readable."
3,A Tasty Read,Oddly enough I've chosen to read this book during Lent. I would love to be in her shop sipping one of her chocolate confections. But for now I will take pleasure in the way she welcomes anyone and everyone into her shop and seems to know what their special desire is. I wonder what she would give me?
5,Your senses will be left reeling!,"This book is a glorious invasion of the senses, delivered with astounding attention to detail. I haven't read such a rich, exocative novel for quite some time. You can taste the chocolat on every page!"
5,"Mouth-watering, adult fairy tale for the heart","This is a wonderful book, a fairy tale for adults about a good woman with a troubled past who arrives in a small French village and improves the quality of the lives of the inhabitants by teaching them to live for today, and to enjoy one of the greatest of joys, chocolate. Full of mystery and passion, the write is exquisite. There isn't a word out of place. If you love to be carried away on a pastoral summer breeze, this book is perfect. IT's a truly lovely, sweet story, not overly sweet..just nicely done."
5,This is a most vivid novel.,"Not really my usual genre, yet I couldn't wait to pick it up again and sample more of the story. The prose is so eloquent it transports you to France. The chocolate is tantalising but more so one can visualise the village entirely and feel the wind of change. The best I've read in a long time."
4,Just Desserts (sorry),"Chocolat is a modern fairy tale in which an unmarried chocolate maker and her daughter run afoul the local parish priest when they move into a small French town to set up shop. While the tale is not a highly original one, Joanne Harris excels at creating an atmosphere of mystery and magic and peoples her novel with characters the reader can readily identify with. Her descriptions of this small town and its many denizens make for a delightful read. The conventional plot is told in an unconventional manner, with just enough twists and turns to keep anyone occupied and entertained."
4,Chocobook or Chocomovie?,"I loved the movie ""Chocolat"" so much that I saw it twice in the theater and just had to buy the book. I found the book less enjoyable than the movie, I believe it was because I knew everything that was going to happen and nothing seemed to be new. I'm telling you - if you have not seen the *movie* yet, save it for after the book! That way the book is very enjoyable! *S*"
2,Unimpressive.,This book did not inspire me at all. I have to admit to being totally shocked when I discovered that it had been made into a film!! In my opinion it is simply not an engaging enough tale to warrant the attention of the film industry. I have to admit that I did not feel much sympathy for the characters and this obviously left me somewhat unimpressed by this book.
4,Loved it,"Irresistible, sweet and magical! Loved this book and loved the movie! Wish they did not change so much in the movie but it was still great."
2,Did not live up to the hype,"I was disappointed with this book. It was too slow going in the scenes with the priest and I was easily bored for most of it. Also, I feel that Ms. Harris's attemps to be secretive only backfire - I was not dying to unravel any mysteries, I truly wanted to just finish so I could start a better book.I love the concept, but it could have been better executed."
5,Absolutely delicious!!!,"Love, love, loved this book. The language is so delicious you will find yourself searching your cabinets for chocolate, even if you're not a big fan of chocolate to begin with!! Great story!"
2,She should trust her readers,"While the book showed some promise at the beginning, I grew tired of the simply-drawn characters. If a writer can't trust her readers to understand that a character is evil without comparing that character to a Nazi, the author needs to work a little longer on her story. The author just didn't trust her readers to understand earlier actions, words and descriptions of her characters, so the book became repetitive, and the characters more one-dimensional.This wouldn't necessarily keep me from reading future books by this author. The dialog, her characters, and her descriptions, at the beginning of the book, were interesting. As time passes, I trust that the author will develop, as will her characters."
2,Unmemorable,"Chocolat is an ambitious novel that attempts to set up a classic good versus evil duel set against the backdrop of a closed-minded little town. Harris's writing is appealing, but the story is predictable and the characters are cookie-cutter sterotypes.I gave Chocolat two stars instead of one because the parts of the novel that tell the story of Vianne's migrations with her mother and with her daughter are compelling, as are the vignettes in which she interweaves cooking and magic. Harris obviously has a lively imagination and has led a fascinating life, but the plot takes an early turn for the obvious and follows through to the end in like fashion."
4,A treat to the tounge and the soul,"As I slip a nougat of dark chocolate into my mouth I feel a tingle go down my spine and my mouth craves more! More! This is similar to the sensation I got when turning each page of Chocolat. We all know what a treat a delicious piece of chocolate is to the tongue. But, this novel, Chocolat, was just as delicious to my soul. Just as I find myself craving my daily intake of the warm dark candy, I couldn't stoop thinking, yearning to get home to continue reading in my beloved novel, Chocolat. Whimsical and sentimental, with the perfect combination of ingredients, this novel takes its reader on a journey to the small French town where the story is set. A great book to curl up in bed to or relax after a long day."
2,Skip this book and go to the Movie,This is one situation that I can assume the movie is better than the book. With all the hype I expected more magic. I felt the book was slow moving and grated on my last nerve. The only saving grace was the elderly woman. I wante to know what her future held for her and what was to come of her interaction with the many lives she encountered. Other than that I felt the book was EXTREMELY hard to get through and I was happy that it finally ended.
2,Funny and one-dimensional,"Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with ""literature"" today and doesn't merit recommendation."
3,I actually liked the movie better,"It seems strange, but I liked the movie better. The novel did not quite achieve the same level of magic. I don't want to give away anything but the outcome with the priest was not as satisfying as with the mayor in the movie. But it is not without merit- and was a quite enjoyable novel."
3,Chocolat Review,I thought the book Chocolat was great and I enjoyed reading it. It was definitely a change of pace from all other books I have read in school which made it that much more enjoyable. I think that it was a good decision for Joanne Harris to have the book set up in journal entries by both Vianne and Reynaud because it allowed us to see both of their points of view instead of only one perspective throughout the entire novel.I thought the details in the book were amazing especially about the chocolates because most of the time I could almost taste the chocolates in my mouth as I was reading it.Vianne Rocher was a very admirable character in this novel. She demonstrated the strengths of a woman and the courage to stand up against a society for your beliefs. She remained strong even when she became pregnant and when Roux left her for Josephine. I think that she was portrayed very well in the novel.
4,Chocolat is excellent!,"Joanne Harris has written a beautiful novel that grabs the reader from the start. She uses imagery, great detail, and clever dialogue to portray the little French village of Lansquenet and the diverse characters within the village. All of the characters are fully developed and most are dynamic in nature. Through the main character, Vianne Rocher, Joanne teaches the reader the importance of generosity and respect for others. We should also not deny ourselves happiness because of what others may think. I highly recommend this book to all, especially chocolate lovers!"
3,Well-written but too many questions...,"I at first loved this book. The characterizations were wonderful, the descriptions rich and vivid, and the writing clear and entertaining. But I found that there was so much alluded to that was not explored in enough detail, and things happened for which there was not enough explanation. When the book ended, I found it to be a big letdown.It has a lot of merit because of the strength of the writing and the story line, but it could have used a few extra chapters to fully flesh out some of the items that were alluded to."
5,a delicious little book,"I read this book based on a recommendation from a good friend. The girl has good taste in books. It was a wonderfully relaxing read all the while being full of interesting twists and turns. (how can I love it when the priest is not a priest but a mayor?! That just changes everything...)I love the dichotomy between the ""witch"" (she'll never admit to it) and the priest (he'll never admit to anything) at Lent, no less. It just doesn't get any better than this.Harris's style of switching between the two points of view and how it reveals certain bits and pieces at certain times creates wonderful pacing for the novel.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something to read that is both enjoyably relaxing (and not taxing on the brain) and still has a wonderful plot full of interesting twists and turns and tidbits."
3,Delicious easy read but . . .,"The language was lovely, the descriptions of chocolate delicious, but the characters were contrived, and the plot too obviously formula. Battle of good and evil, temptation and resistance, the good wins in the end and leaves the world a better place . . . glad to have read it, but it didn't leave me wanting more.I recommend it highly for chocolate-loving people wanting a light quick read that they don't have to think much about."
5,Sweet and savory!,"Someone lent me this book and it sat on my nightstand for a month before I finally picked it up and could not put it down. Not an intense story, but one filled with all things having to do with human nature-love, friendship, anger, hurt, and how this young woman manages to bring lost souls together using her mystical personality and above all-chocolate. Who could resist?"
1,.......and they cut down a tree for this?,I truly regret wasting time reading this ...coz spare time is something I don't have much off. I've read picture books designed for toddlers...that have more of a plot than this book did.
3,A bit predictable,"I found this a bit predictable, and was a little disappointed. A lot of people had said it was a fabulous book, really well written, great story etc etc, so perhaps my expectations were too high. For me, it wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't anything special either."
2,Not impressed,"I realize this book is a fairy tale and the standards have to be a little different. I am obviously not the audience that this book was intended for and the audience that was captivated by it. I did not believe the plot or the setting. If there had been a little more magic, I might have bought it. It seemed to me to be a collection of cliches from other stories. As the author had actually lived in France, I hoped for a little more realism. I've read about the anti-Catholic bias in film and books and generally dismissed it as over reaction, but I thought this book had an offesively clear anti-Catholic bias. The men don't come out very well either."
1,Don't bother if you have a brain,"I read this book one Christmas holiday and have rarely felt so utterly cheated out of a few hours. The priest was a cheap target (I say this as an atheist!), a straw man, and the romance empty and shallow. I kept waiting for some depth, something that would redeem the book, some kind of moral or intellectual center, perhaps, and there was none. There are loads of great books out there -- don't waste your time on this."
5,Charming and Hypnotic,"Much like the confections she describes, Joanne Harris' story is a sweet indulgence. The book is similar in tone to Alice Hofmann, with a mystical outsider, Vianne Rocher arriving in a small town and her effect on it's inhabitants. The book early on sets up it's themes of right and wrong, spirituality, religion, and the delight in sensual pleasures. But be aware, this isn't a sappy candy coated romance or mortality tale. Underneath it's simple story are a set of rich and complex characters battling their own demons, and who help bring alive this small French village. The book is also soon to be released as a motion picture with Juliette Binnoche, and Johnny Depp"
3,Not as literary as the cover indicates,"IMHO, the good characters (Vianne, Armande) were all good, and the bad (Reynaud) were all bad. It would have been more interesting with more ambiguity. But the desciptions of the candies were delicious, and I had to stop for chocolate breaks while reading."
1,Not very creative,"This is a poorly written book about some sort of a magical woman and her daugher bringing ""happiness and freedom"" to a French village where they spend a period of time. Well, not that the idea itself is bad, but it has been used hundreds of times before in much better ways!! If you really want to have the solid version of this kind of tale, rent Mary Poppins for instance, and be happy and free..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I was quite disappointed by the characters in this book. If people really see ""church-goers"" as hateful and snobbish as the author portrays then they're hanging out with the wrong Christians. So I entitled my review ""Don't Waste Your Time"". The priest gorges himself on chocolate, the ""heroine"" is impregnated by the local gypsy, and everyone lives happily ever after."
1,Thank you one star reviewers...,"I'm halfway through and was wondering whether or not to continue. The book's back cover reviews by NY Times, USA Today, etc. describe it as enchanting and other fine praisewords but thusfar I'm far from enchanted. No way can one trust these book reviewers, I'vw found. Thanks to Amazon reviews here I won't waste any more time on this and will move on to more interesting reading."
4,A story about a strong woman,"I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. I decided to read this book because I saw a trailor for the movie and figured that I would prefer to try the book for depth instead. This was a story of a vibrant, strong woman, and I greatly appreciated that.The main character, Vianne Rocher, moves into this small town in France and decides to open a chocolate shop. She's a colorful woman who stands out in this gray, drab town but is determined to fit in without compromising her ideals. I find the way she confonts opposition to be inspiring. This was a highly moving book. I actually believe I felt myself becoming a rebel as I turned the pages."
3,I enjoyed this book,"I picked this book because I had seen the movie, It is quite different from the movie the theme is a little darker than the movie. Yet, the story it self was very good it has an up beat ending.It is well written and keeps you involved in the story. You really look forward to what happens next. I recomend this book, but do not compare it to the movie, enjoy it for the story it is."
4,loved it,great story line & a fun readheard the movie was good but I always like the book better anyway
2,History created for your reading displeasure,"I am appalled at many of the photographs in this text. There are many clearly staged photos of African-Americans in pseudo-historical garb portraying a happy life on the plantation. These ""slaves"" are dressed in pefectly clean clothing, do no field work and dance and sing, marry and hug and smile, all in a day's ""work."" While live re-enactments have their place at historical sites, here they are not surrounded by any context that explains the truth behind these images.The text may be helpful to children writing reports but I would not recommend this as a resource. If it comes home from the library, I can only hope that an adult is standing by to explain that these photos are of actors playing sanitized roles for the camera."
5,A deeply strring album.,"I found this to be an incredibly moving musical experience. The artist puts words to the emotions that we all deal with. If you are tired of songs that sound so good and say so little, this is what you are looking for. Shear musical talent, earthy vocals, and raw lyrics, fuse to form this revolutionary album. You will wonder, ""Where have these songs been all my life?"""
4,Very nice,"Mr. Green hits the drums like the god of drums as usual. Real nice, sometimes trippy music here. Want to know what the members of Modest Mouse do on their spare time? Buy this CD and Sharpen Your Teeth, by Ugly Casanova. It's all good."
1,high chair safety strap,"I bought this almost two years ago, the strap never did work, as it was missing the proper screw or fastener. I contacted the company with no response so eventually threw it away. Very disappointing."
5,Milwaulkee nothing but the best,I had other Milwaulkee tools and have come to learn that thy are nothing short of the best. I bought the 28 volt kit from Amazon which came with the flashlight. I'm a home inspector and thought I would use it on the job. The light is on steady for almost three hours and it still has half the charge left. The light is powerful and easy to handle. The weight is well distributed and having the swivel head enabling the light to be set down and pointing the beam where you need it is great. The 28 volt set including the flashlight is the best designed and built there is.
5,Great Price for a Handy Light,"I couldn't believe the low price ($9.99) for this Milwaukee product and actually expected to pay up to $30 each for the replacements that we needed. At that price I bought a couple of extras. Although I was skeptical and expected to receive some kind of cheap knockoff, the work lights were as advertized in factory packaging and worked great right out of the box. I should have bought a couple of more. Of course, its the batteries that are the killer and I found them at a local (Wisconsin) Fleet Farm store for $10 less each than any price I found on the internet. The lights were $32 plus 5.5% sales tax at Fleet Farm."
1,Awful,"I purchased this light and the first few times I used it, it worked fine. Then it started turning itself off, when I contacted the manufacturer they said it 'probably' needed a new bulb.I purchased new bulbs, and guess what. It still blinks off. I returned it for a refund. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,It's a killer!,"This is jazz, heavy on the funk with a definite rock edge. Most importantly the songs are cool and not just a vehicle for soloing. Fusion in the 80's could be kind of cheesy, but have no fear with this disc it's one of his strongest."
2,Loud Jazz,"CD is OK,at best,not many good selections on this CD and nowhere as good as the Hand Jive CD."
4,"Retail in Detail, very informative!","Retail in Detail, How to start and manage a small retail business, was the most informative book I have read to date. In all the information out there to help you decide what to do and when, it gets a bit overwhelming. This book broke down very important points and explains them in detail. Other areas are hit lightly but you are given a variety of other areas of interest to answer them whether it is another book, etc. I will keep this with me for a long time."
4,Good Info,I am thinking about starting my own small business & found this book to contain very good info about what to do & even more important what not to do. Gives both the pros & cons of starting your own business in a enjoyable reading style but does not sugar coat the difficulties involved. I found lots of helpful info about who to contact & where to go to get both additional info & purchasing wholesale.
2,Lacking in substance,I found this book dissapointing for the following reasons:The author's only experience in retail was in giftware so he hardly mentioned examples from other industries.There is little mention of sales techniques (vital to success in today's competitive environment) nor little advise on how to wow your customers with extraordinary service.The book offered little advise on which types of people you should employ - and how they should be trained to maximise your customer's shopping experience and your company's profitability.If you are looking for a book to inspire you - rather look at Retail Success.
3,wow a real eye opener!!,This book was really great. I learned things that I really never thought about before. It gave me some good ideas to go off of. I think that its a great book for anyone that is thinking about their own business.
4,Interesting,"You cannot compare the assassination of John F. Kennedy to the terror attacks on September 11, 2001. I'm not saying one event is more horrible than the other. I'm just saying you cannot compare them. I was a little girl when Kennedy was killed, and I remember how it was. I also remember how I felt on September 11, 2001. I did not feel fear on or after November 22, 1963. I did not feel anger at foreigners, or wonder who or what else was going to be attacked. I and so many millions of Americans just felt shock, horror, and heartbreak for ourselves and for Mrs. Kennedy and her two children.This book would be a good addition to any library on the JFK assassination."
2,Inaccurate time,"I cannot get this watch to keep the same time as any of my other time telling devices. Not my computer, cell phone, other clocks and watches or my satellite radio.On the up side. It is easy to read even though very small. This is due to the white face with black numbers."
2,Casio Round Analog Watch,"I purchased this watch so I can wear to work. I am a cashier so I use my hands a lot so I didn't want anything to expensive or too flashy to wear at work, just something that would tell time. This watch came in and it didn't fit. I never thought I had huge wrist but it wouldn't go around even to the first hole. The watch band is also plastic knowing that i still ordered since you can't really tell on the picture. When I received it the watch just look like a kids toy to me I couldn't imagine it lasting that long. It just wasn't for me. The reason for the 2 stars the shipping was very prompt."
5,Just what my wife wanted,My wife inherited a 20 year version of this watch and needed another.The face is easy to read. Replacing the whole watch was less expensivethan buying a new band!
3,Nothing to email home about,"I purchased this casio watch because my other watch had died and I needed a simple watch and I didn't want to spend much money. It was very inexpensive and that's what I was looking for.It does what it's supposed to, which is to keep basic time. I wish I had gotten a watch with the calendar function because I never realized how frequently I looked to my old watch for the date. I felt I wouldn't need it, but a lifetime of looking for the date on one's wrist is hard to break.My biggest complaint with the watch is the texture of the wristband. It's some sort of rubbery plastic material. I hate how it feels on my skin and it's a little too short for my wrist. I've actually purchased a replacement watch band for it and that helps a lot.If you want a basic cheap watch that holds time and is easily readable, this watch would be fine. And if you lose it, no big deal because it only cost $11 or $12 dollars."
1,Too cheap to be true,Came nonfunctional. That's about all I got on this. I didn't even go through the hassle of getting a replacement.
5,a watch for city like Houston,"My wife was looking for a water resistant watch, so she can take a shower with it, and do almost everything without lost to much if it was damaged, this reason she enjoyed it."
3,Watch,"It was a little smaller and plainer than I thought it would be, but it tells time just fine, and it was very inexpensive!"
3,nice product but,"the wick will get clogged with minerals and quit working, plus you can order this direct from the company much cheaper than through this store and with much less shipping."
5,Always need new ones and always go to Amazon.,I am lucky knowing that Amazon can come up with a fit even if the appliance is over 10 years old.
3,I know I'm going to get shot down for this,"The book was beautifully written, and parts of it were very interesting, but basically it was the autobiography of someone who's life wasn't particularly interesting. Ahmed's prose style is very good, but it couldn't carry the book for me. She made some interesting points about Islam and Moslem culture, but they were to few and far between."
5,Great item!,I boought this item for my friend. She likes it much as she can share her music with her boy friend.
2,too many re-recordings for my taste,"That's right, this is a collection of mostly the 60's countrypolitan stereo remakes of the 1950's classics with a sprinkling of originals from the 1960's but the re-recordings are definitely enough to let you all know that this CD is not recommended and that I recommend the Legacy ""Look What Thoughts Will Do"" 2 CD set with only the originals. It may be a little higher priced but it delivers what it promises, the originals. The disc is rated 1 star for the heavy amount of re-recordings (many awful performances) and another star for the sprinkling of originals."
5,Lefty is great,This is a remake of Lefty Frizzell's old time hits. It sure brought back many memories of our dating days and the early days of our marrage. It was great to hear him again after all these years.
4,Fine collection,"Yes, there are some re-recordings on this collection, but, they are tastefully done and still worth a listen. I could not imagine what Country Music would be without Lefty and Webb, and this collection shows you just how much country music owes to Mr Frizzell. If you are a true country music fan, you'll recognize every one of these numbers, but there are some real standouts here, to include: ""Cigarettes & Coffee Blues"" and a great version of ""Gone, Gone, Gone"". The production is fine and other than the remakes, there really is nothing to complain about. B+"
4,essential,This guy was Gram Parson's favourite country singer. This makes him worth listening to. Essential for country lovers.
2,will probably upset some linguists,"This book appears to be better than it is. One reason our professor had selected it was the use of graphics and such- it looked to be far more engaging than most similar texts. And I will admit, it was more engaging, the stories it added were good and the design of the pages was very well done. However, it was clearly written by a psychologist, not a linguist, there were quite a few mistakes, as well as many waaaay over simplifications. Anyone who has taken at least than an introduction to linguistics could pick out bunches of mistakes, and I'm quite sure my professor was making a list to send to the publisher. There were numerous typos and grammar mistakes, too. I use it from time to time to get an example of a point or check something quickly, but overall it was quite a disappointment."
4,Crossing Over,"There's no doubt in my mind that this is an important book however odd. It has touched me deeply although there are many things in here that I don't understand. With all due respect to the author's incredible journey, she is in reality a very different kind of human being and I have trouble placing her in my experience.Of course there are things I can relate to here, but much of it reads like science fiction.I have trouble with the reality she is describing and often ""how"" she is describing, her use of language is quizzical and sometimes puzzling,it is also disturbing and unsettling, but that is precisely why the book is so important. It has an alien quality and that makes sense to me but it's a hard book to ""like"", although you respect it, if that makes any sense at all."
2,Not my kind of dance...,"It goes partially good, although some scenes are great. It has more of a plot than gorgeous models. It delivers partially."
2,check out the website...,"You can read these interviews (or most of them) at the tradingmarkets.com website. These are the same interviews published in a book in order, IMO, to generate additional sales. Some good interviews, though, but nothing to compare with the Market Wizards books."
3,The excitement of it all...,"So thrilling, you can't put it down. Relevant, more probabtive than pejudicial, and bordering on hearsay, since it is offered to assert the truth of the matter. But, I think that the judge make take judicial notice of this book..."
4,let's go round there...,"If you like late 80's pop-alternative bands with female lead singers such as PRIMITIVES and VOICE OF THE BEEHIVE then you will like THE DARLING BUDS. This is their debut album and it's the only one I own. If you haven't heard the Darling Buds yet then check out ""Let's Go Round There""."
5,Music K-8 Magazine & CD's,"I've gotten the Music K-8 Magazine since it started 20 years ago. It's a GREAT teaching tool. I love it! Unfortunately, it's cheaper to buy through Plank Rd. Publishing than it is through Amazon.com. I love Amazon and shop here most of the time, but this product should be ordered from the company that puts it out."
1,pseudo-science,These essays are pop psychology at its worst. Most of the authors simply generalize at tiresome length about diagnostic categories and criteria which don't have any scientific or medical justification. The editing is particularly sloppy. The essays are inconsistent. Some of them are wordy beyond belief. All of them are self congratulatory collections of assertions.I could not help the sense that these essays are all calling cards trying to drum up business for Jungist analysts and therapists.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered and received two Kidde kitchen fire extinguishers. One was empty upon arrival, as was indicated by the pressure dial pointer in the red. The devices have a plastic key which must be broken in order to use the extinguisher.The plastic key was not broken: the tank was empty when it was packed and shipped.I was required to pay shipping in order to return it. The deadline for a return is pretty tight. Being as I have to ship during the Christmas holiday rush, I doubt that I will meet the deadline. In shipping it, I was losing more money.I will not do business with that company again. I wish that I was able to rate this purchase in negative numbers; one star is too generous.Update: ANTOLINE contacted Amazon and credited my account with the value of the fire extinguisher that I had returned to them. Now I will give them 2 stars."
1,Arrived fully discharged,"Purchased this right before Christmas as my wife had mentioned we should have an extiguisher in the kitchen. Opened up the Amazon box to find powder all over inside and when I looked at the gauge, it showed it fully discharged. Called Amazon and they sent out a replacement which arrived intact and told me that I need to dispose of the broken one per local laws as I could not ship it back to them. Two weeks later, I get an email from Amazon telling me that they had not received the broken one back and that they were going to charge me for the replacement. Had to call AGAIN to have them reverse the charges. There is definitely a problem with the packaging or manufacturing of this extinguisher if so many of them are arriving discharged."
3,Not sure if it's really full ??,"Arrived as promised,but packaging left some to be desired as the box was ripped and torn but it seems to be OK. I also see that the gauge shows it to be just barely full or just barely in the green. Hope it's full if I need it."
4,"You buy it and hope never to use it, like insurance.","It looks like it will do the job. If I ever have a fire, then I will give it an operational review. But it looks the part hanging on the kitchen wall."
4,Looks good,This extinguisher looks good (is as shown in online images) and was priced well. Until I (God forbid) have an emergency I guess I can't know much more.
3,No Return of faulty product,"We ordered 2 of these - one for our boat and one for the kitchen. One arrived in great shape but the other one arrived in a box of foam -- already activated. With ""no return"" policy we are stuck. Don't think I'll ever buy anything with that policy again, no matter how good a deal it may seem."
3,Poor Packaging,"The first of these fire extinguishers arrived fully discharged (a rechargeable extinguisher arrived in the same box undamaged). Amazon was very helpful and quickly provided me with a new extinguisher. After reading other reviews I have seen that this happens to many people. No complaints about Amazon, just the flimsy retail package that Kidde uses for this extinguisher."
2,They were delivered half empty.,There's no way of knowing how well it works until you need to use it. You can't test it without discharging it and risking its future effectiveness. I bought two types of Kidde extinguishers. One for kitchen fires and another for multi-type fires and both were delivered with the gauges showing them to be half full. Its too difficult for me to return them due to my poor health condition and could not find a way to reach customer service so I'm stuck with them. I just hope I'll never need to extinguish a fire but if I do I really hope they will work.
4,SammyDjs,"Hopefully, I will never have to use this fire extinquisher. But, there is peace of mind in having one."
1,Arrived broken,"Opened the box and had a bunch of white powdery stuff puff up.. along with some loose rattling of something, and more powder coming out when I attempted to take it out. Checked the contents setting and saw its already mostly empty (not 100%... I guess there's still some in there).Found out you can't just return the item, you HAVE to contact customer service since the item is considered hazardous. Yet then customer service told me that its ok to discard it in the trash since its already mostly empty. I did mention the powder to her... but she had no clue. Oy.Replacement is being shipped."
3,Discharging within months. Check gauge frequently,"We purchased this extinguisher and another Kidde 1-A:10-B:C extinguisher 7months ago. I checked the gauges today to find that the Kidde Kitchen Fire extinguisher is almost in the red. It's been sitting under the kitchen sink and undergone one car ride. The other extinguisher gauge is centered in the green area still.Luckily, I haven't had to use the extinguisher to fully test it. I was going to buy a larger, higher rated extinguisher for the main downstairs; so I'll just put the other small Kidde one under our sink for kitchen use. I do still trust the brand. I think this particular kitchen extinguisher was made too cheaply.Remember to check gauges on fire extinguishers regularly! The fact that there is a gauge is why I still give this one 3 stars."
4,Good product,From exterior looks the product looks good and the condition was excellent. Gauge shows that the product is in usable condition. I have it in my kitchen and hopefully can use it when needed.
2,"Don't order by internet, buy in person only.","Amazon does not support this product. If it arrives damaged, too bad. No returns, no credit, no replacement, PERIOD.It is heavy and Amazon shipping clerks place this meavy product in a large box with only limited packing paper. The odds of damage are far greater than the odds of receiving this product in good shape.The base is metal and is heavy. The control valve and handle are made from plastic.What are the odds here?Better to purchase from your neighborhood hardware or other store. You can inspect the product before leaving the store and, even if damaged, the store can refund or replace. Not Amazon though, too bad, so sad!Otherwise, hard to review this product unless you have had a fire. Only then will you know if it works or not. Obviously, it won't work if it arrives broken."
1,This Disgusts ME,Shipping was slow and when it arrived IT WAS FULLY discharged...WOW...I can refill it because its one time use only...I inspected the Fire Extinguisher and only to find out the whole thing is made out of plastic...I will never buy from kidde again...And Id rather buy Co2 or Foam its not as messy.NO ONE BUY THIS!!!!!!
4,Lots of banjo tunes!,"This is a great book if you already know how to play and just want a lot of tunes. My only complaint is that not all tunes are available in all styles. (That is, some have a clawhammer arrangement, some have a 3-finger arrangement, and some have both.) I can't really blame the authors, though, as it's a pretty large volume as it is. Overall, it's exactly what it's advertised to be."
3,New and Genuine ideas but very repetitive,This book introduces new and shocking ideas about civilization. Its controversial but true for the most part. My problem with the book is that it is very repetitive
2,Where Were You Derrick?,"Derrick Jensen is one of the most important writers of our time. ""A Language Older Than Words"" is essential reading, a truly brilliant book.If you have ever felt caught between the desire to spike a tree and the belief that violence only begets violence, then like me you may well have looked forward to the release of ""Endgame,"" Jensen's exploration of whether violence can be justified in response to our dark and destructive culture.Gandhi, Edward Abbey, Martin Luther King, Thoreau, all examined this question. While Jensen may well be original enough to belong in this list, he failed with the first volume of ""Endgame.""Basically this first volume covers the same ground as ""Columbus and Other Cannibals."" It just takes Jensen a lot longer. He is exorcising his anger, I imagine. Understandable. But as a reader, not what I hoped for from from this book.The book is self-indulgent, rambling, and unfocused. The brilliant Derrick Jensen is absent."
2,a bit silly,"I have read most of derrick jensen's books, and he makes good arguments but they are handpicked.....he pulls down civilisation with all its ills and injustices, but offers no better solution.....He himself eats salmon but bemoans its demise....he himself likes to gamble....eat meat.....travel by car and plane etc.....yet criticises a society and its people for doing the same thing.....no example is set or put into practice.....it is easy to pull apart something, but alot harder to replace or rebuild.....in the end the feeling is; whats his point and it all seems abit silly to rage against the machine that he himself embraces and benefits from.....a good read but shallow at the same time.....walk the talk jensen and you'll add some meat to the words written....rod simpson...australia"
3,Great condition!,"I haven't read the book yet, but I was impressed by the condition of this 'used' book. It was also delivered very quickly to my house."
1,"But, you've never had a gun.","J.W.K. you wrote, ""Fits Like a Gun in Your Hand""How would you know?I'm not just being flipent. I'm pointing out that Greens are (compared to say, rednecks) passive in temperment and ideology. They talk and talk....Which is good, because there actions would be (like blowing up a dam) would be quite evil."
5,"Riley closer to ""World Music"" than to ""minimalism"": immensely engaging works for string quartet","As I write this fine disc, with four immensely engaging string quartets written between the late 1970s and 1983 for the Kronos Quartet, can be found for cheap under at least two entries:Cadenza on the Night Plain(with my detailed review) andCadenza On The Night Plain). It is Riley writing NOT minimalist or repetitive music, but music inspired by North-American folk music and North-Indian ragas, dance-like and dynamic, colorful, easy listening but never pandering.TT 75 minutes (which is substantially more than the ""over 63 minutes of music"" boasted on the booklet's front cover!), excellent liner notes, great disc."
5,Whatchu know 'bout dat wood?,"From the California Bay area to Austin Texas, these men have got it down. I'm feeling the southern 'tang and they can definitely ""flow"". California is patiently waiting for their chance to get a show. One question....When can we expect a video???"
5,Fantastic!,"It's been a VERY long time since I've been able to pick up a book and put it back down after reading it all in one sitting. The book played out like a well-planned movie. Every moment, every character, and every line of dialogue had me feening for more. It is one of the most accurate potrayals of the Asian-American gangster scene. Expect no boring cliches filled with typical Asian-American strereotypes. I cannot wait until this author churns out another book. Pick up this book today."
5,A definite page-turner,"A page-turner that will have time fly by, ""Sugar of Lead"" dives into the lifestyle and culture of Asian mafias. The rules and codes adhered to in this forbidden world are explored and tested in this riveting story. The story masterfully presents the art of drama as the main character of Michael Pierce wrestles with the conflicts that occur as his society, his adopted culture, and his inner desires all tear him in different directions. A must-read!"
5,Great music from a master,"The music is great! Amazon's service was lousy. I originally ordered the set of 2 CD's. Silk Road 1 was a bad recording so I returned it, and Amazon sent me Silk Road 2 as a replacement. Guess they can't read very well. I sent back the duplicate Silk Road 2; Amazon gave me a credit on Silk Road 1, and because they did that I had to re-order, rather than Amazon just re-sending a good CD of Silk Road 1."
1,Junk,This cd has a production value of zero. This is not the fault of the seller but of the production company. The music that was loaded onto the master cd has the beginning of plays that are cut off and the end of the play chopped off. Do not buy this cd it is a waste of money. This is no reflection on the seller or Kitaro. Only on the producers of the cd.
5,Very soothing mystical music.,Great relaxation music. Just put on those headphones and close your eyes your in for a mystical ride.
2,silk road vol. 2,"sorry couldn't find any other place to write. i ordered 3 cds and only recieved 2.i ordered silk road vol 1, silk road vol 2 and the essential kitaro but unfortunatly didn't recieve silk road vol 2.if this could some how be rectified that would be great.please don't hesitate to contact me .thanks Paul"
3,illustrations save this story,Features the Skidi-Pawnee people.An illustrated legend - a boy is led by the spirit of a horse to become a great leader.
4,"Overall very useful, informative and convenient.","Some information is outdated but I always confirm pet policies in advance. I like this guide because it has all the information in one place, so I don't have to worry about a dozen different hotel guide books. In addition it includes information about the harder to find B&B's and family run hotels."
5,Great!,"I had an earlier edition of this book, which I used a lot, but it got outdated. It is invaluable in searching out places that take pets. Gives you somewhere to start. I used internet sites too, but they are outdated, so I ordered this new edition."
1,Almost False Advertising,"This is one of the most self-serving pieces of... I have ever bought. It's more of an autobiography of the author (Eline Barish) than a directory. The listings are stale and MOST (5 out of 7) of the places I stopped at last week didn't accept pets and NEVER HAD... That's all you can say about it. As a single woman traveling with my dog, this is a headache that I didn't need and don't want anyone else to have either..."
2,Call Ahead!,"This book is an excellent place to start and gives you an idea of chains that typically take pets -- a surprising number.However, I just got burned trying to find a place to stay late at night in Baltimore. Two of the places listed in the book did not take pets, had never taken pets. I ended up in a hotel you would not believe because I was just too exhausted to keep driving.So ... take what's in this book with a grain of salt and phone ahead. Or buy a different book. I threw my copy away when I got to New York, if that tells you anything."
1,Vacationing With Your Pet,"Don't waste your time or your money. I've tried to use this book on three different trips, all for different regions of the US and only ended up frustrated. I thought having the latest edition would make a difference. I guess not, I've had more people than I care to count tell me *I've worked here for X number of years and we have never allowed pets of any kind.* How this book received *1st Place Best Reference Book by the Dog Writers' Association of America* is beyond me."
1,Where's the Beef?,"We had difficulty planning a trip with our dog using this book because while there are thousands of places that take pets, specific information is sketchy. With just the name, address, telephone number and rates to go on, I felt uncomfortable trying to guess which place was appropriate for us to stay with our dog. We did ultimately take a trip using the book, but were dissapointed with most of the accomodations."
5,Beautiful yet Sad Photographs,"This book is on the last three years of steam pulled trains in England. It's a beautiful set of pictures of the latest and last steam locomotives to be used pulling regular trains on their normal working schedule. Here is a beautiful set of photographs, printed in quite high quality - unfortunately not in color.The final years covers a three year period from 1965 to 1968 when steam basically went away. I can't help but think what a shame to see these magnificant machines captured here in pictures and to know that the pictures are all that is left of all but the few retained in museums.These pictures are not of special trains or special setups. They are everyday working trains, carrying people or goods somewhere. The only thing really special about them is that on the next trip, or maybe next month this same train will not have a steam engine."
4,The Final Nights are upon us ...,"This final book to the Brujah (Slave) Trilogy is a good read. I may be wrong, but it's also a nice precursor to the Time of Judgement novel that will bring a close to the World of Darkness (Gehenna). Sorry, if this is a spoiler for some - but I doubt it is ;)Elements that are hinted at in the previous 2 books are fleshed out and revealed in this one, while others are left unanswered. We meet some notable characters from WoD lore, as well as experience some interesting plot developments that will keep the reader engaged from start to finish.The Final Nights are upon us ..."
5,Great recipes!!,Got this for a close friend who was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes! Great recipes! Love that photos were included!
4,Biggest book of Diabetic Recipes,Just what I was looking for since I found out the I was Diabetic. Love the recipes
2,repeating,I've seen many of these recipes before. I'm looking for some new ideas. I have another Better Homes and Gardens recipe book that I love so was disappointed with this one.
5,diabetic big book,Great book I will never run out of reciepts to use now that I have been diagnosed with diabetes Thanks
4,Good addition to my collection,With family members who are diabetic this gave me a good variety of dishes I can have when they come to visit. Also handy for company potlucks - I list the dishes as diabetic friendly and people feel more comfortable eating.
5,The best Diabetic Recipe Book I have found,"Well, I ordered several Diabetic recipe books recently. This one is produced by better homes and gardens. It features a really good variety of recipes. The Preparation and cooking times listed are accurate. The Carb and calorie counts are accurate as well. My copy came spiral bound so that it opens flat to make it an easy reference while cooking. I have tried several of the recipes and found every one to be delicious. If I could offer any suggestions on how to improve the book the only one for me would be to add the glycemic load for each of the dishes.If you only buy 1 Diabetic recipe book, this is the one."
3,Disappointed!,"I love cookbooks with lots of pictures. This book lacks in the category of pictures. I would like to say that I saw a lot of recipes that I wanted to try, but the truth is that I hardly looked at any of the recipes which had no pictures. I eventually will look at a lot of them, but most likely it will be when I have exhausted most recipes in some of my other books. In short, this big book has hardly any pictures--so disappointing!"
4,Anxiously readable,"I breezed through this book in two evenings. Anyone interested in a quick, enjoyable read should pick it up. The characters probably aren't people that you know, but that makes it all the more worthwhile. Throughout the story, Bowers is able to instill a feeling of uneasiness or anxiousness in the reader that kept me flipping the pages to try and squash it."
5,adkinson/Judson Candy Co Pecan Pralines,"Atkinson Candy Company, Judson Pecan Pralines, 1.25-Ounce, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)This product is a childhood candy that I loved as a kid and have not been able to find in any store, so I went surfing and typed in Judson a click here and a click there lead me to Amzon. I placed my order and 7 days or so later I received my candy it was good too !! 2 cases already gone."
5,And fate stepped in. Thank God for that.,"As I hear it told, Paul was going through a tough time, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to continue making music. It seems some chance meetings, & phone calls from some legendary musicians (Ralph Stanley, Mark Knopfler among others) who informed him they've been long-time fans, & advise to keep plugging away gave him the desire to go on. Man, are we lucky for that! This guy's one of the best kept secrets out there today. You want a true throwback to the days of Hillbilly country? This is your man. He also does rockabilly, and some vintage style rock & roll that you'd swear came right out of the fifties. He blends a variety of subtle styles in his approach, but he's so damn talented that it flows effortlessly. This is music that is timeless, traditional, yet it's fresh. I don't know if this is his best (all of his releases are great), but it's already a staple in my collection, and like every other of his discs, it always will be."
4,Best Bird Bowls Ever!,"Toss out your mismatched collection of bird bowls and get these, I've used them on acrylic and cages with bars (horizontal and verticle) and on playstands, you can fit about 30 in the top rack of your standard dishwasher, best of all you can move your birds bowls to minimize mess and contamination and create a more challenging ""forraging"" experience.Make sure you shop and get them for less than three dollars, this way you can get so many you'll never hesitate to provde a clean fresh bowl of food, water or nutritious fruits and veg!"
3,Okay chips,"Clearly not the best quality as there is some errors in the patters but solid weight and feel, no broken ones, etc."
2,Missing chips,"Nobody likes to lose chips, because the idea of having an incomplete set is just unpleasant. Well, it's worse when chips are missing before they even get to you. Very disappointed."
1,Didn't get what I ordered,Ordered 100 yellow chips. When they came 50 were yellow but 50 some weird yellowish green color even though their package was still marked yellow
4,"Got them as an addition to the Wal-Mart set, heh..","Got these bad boys when I wanted to expand a few colors on a Wal-Mart set. I'm too cheap to go out and buy some actual clay chips. I like the chips though. These chips some how even feel better than the Wal-Mart chips though. Also, as a negative, (I only got red, blue, and white) the colors in the chips is deeper and more pungent, so you can depict the chips from each other. It's not too terrible though, they still look good overall, and these beat those little plastic chips I always played with when I was a kid. :) I recommend it if you want to have a poker night on a budget; they are nice chips for that reason."
2,Ewww,"The color of these chips vary wildly. If you order these, make sure you get them all from the same supplier and all in one shipment. Otherwise, you will probably end up with chips that don't match."
4,4 Stroke Instruction,"As a beginner this well illustrated book by Peter Chinn, a foremost authority of model engines,is a welcomed addition to anyone contemplating a foray into 4 stroke modeling.Concise information, presented in a graduated format, allows the modeler to be brought up to speed on the mechanics of 4 stoke usage. Of course, owing to the date the book was published,it does not cover the recent 4 stroke engines.I have found it invaluable for me to use while perusing the E-Bay model engine website, where one may find many of the vintage engines presented in this book."
3,doesn't hold intensive wear,don't wear it for sports. won't give the right support. and it wear off quickly.
5,Works excellent on toyota highlander 2005,"i read a review of a person saying it didn't work on toyota 2006 so i was confused and puzzled. I decided to give it a go and see if it worked on my 2005 model. I got the adapter, read the instructions, matched the colors, connected to my highlander radio wiring harness and BANG! works like a charm! I was so happy. i avoided cutting my highlander wiring which is the main reason for buying this thing. I cannot be more happier!"
5,Heartwarming Book,"""It has always been my hope that each and every quilt be a product of the maker's heart as well as her hands. The quilts featured in these stories are special because they were created with love, gifted with love and received with love, continuing the tradition of quiltmaking in the best possible way."" Judy B. Dales, quiltmaker, teacher, author, lecturer www.judydales.com"
4,Modelos de Inventario,"Inventario en tránsito, Inventario de amortiguación, Inventario de ciclo, Inventario estacional"
4,A nice place to start,"This book is great for beginners, who are unfamiliar with some of the different types of lace. Although no lace is gone into in depth, there is enough in each part to get you started and understand the differences. The illustrations are very clear, and I found the instructions quite easy to follow. It is only a little book, though, so don't expect too much. The one thing that really delighted me was the chapter on netting - how the fishermen used to do it. There Have been many times when I've searched for information on this topic and have come up empty."
5,works very well.,easy to read. seems to be accurate at all ranges of temperatures. i like it. my wife likees it too
1,Temperature reading is not accurate,"This thermometer reads 5 to 10 degrees low, which is unacceptable, given that reading the temperature is its one and only function."
2,timex temperature,This is easy to read because it's huge. unfortunately it's stuck on 105 degrees since I got it. defective product. Looks like I bought the last one so I can't even exchange it. suspicious if you ask me.
2,Too much character - too little science,"Having read all of the previous titles, it was with high expectations that I tore into this latest creation of the new saint of SF. What a letdown, perhaps akin to watching Michael Jordan play baseball. Greg's understanding of the AI nature of technology futures is truely profound and he has the ability to weave this into a deeply moving, spiritual tale that keeps you on the edge. Now that he has proven that he can write deeply detailed characters with a patina of science, let's hope that he gets back in the kitchen and serves up some meat & potatoes."
2,A disappointment,I am a rabid Greg Egan fan first hooked with permutation city but this book just wasn't up to standard. Egan's best quality in his work is the power of his ideas and this work was considerably lacking in them. Every other book of his I've read has left me staring off into space every other page going...wow could that happen..or thats nifty. I did that perhaps once in this book.The only possible explanation I can think of is that Egan paid attention to all those people who kept screaming about not enough charachter development. Well don't listen to them (at least not if it reduces the density of ideas) plenty of sci-fi books have reasonable charachter development only yours had extroadanairy speculative ideas.
2,Horribly abrupt ending,"Egan develops great characters, and, as always, an interesting premise based in science. I've always enjoyed his forays into AI & physics.The last two chapters, however, destroy this book. He takes the interesting biogenetic monster virus he's developed so well, and has it attack the main character. The book ends immediately, and rather than explain the mystery and leave you thoughtful about science and the future, no conclusions are drawn at all.Finish the book next time, Greg."
2,Not up to Egan's Standards,"A weaker effort from an otherwise brilliant writer. The book's main message seems to be to promote science and rationalism against superstition and sociobabble. Egan's scenes featuring postmodern sociologists Keith and Anita are the high points in the book:""Well, I'd already done a Ph.D. in X-Files Theory at UCLA, and Anita was just starting her Master's in Diana Studies with the University of Leeds, via the net. U Toronto was in the process of opening its own Department of Transgressive Discourseat last!so it was only natural that we both applied for positions.""Unfortunately, the book severely undermines that message with a weak ending that essentially asks the reader conditioned to rationalism to take a denouement full of biobabble on faith.While I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend any other novel by Egan, I cannot recommend this one."
3,Australian SF Reader,"Mutants amok. Or there will be, by the end of this. A couple of kids grow up on their own idyllic not yet Island of Dr Moreau.Their parents are top-line biological researchers looking intro strange goings on in the local butterfly population.It appears evolution is going nuts, and mutations happen almost in reverse.As far as people go, this can be bad things, man. I definitely didn't like this one as much as most of his other work."
3,Amok evolution,"Poor Prahir grows up with fosterparents Keith and Amita.People who do dodgy Science - Keithwith a Ph.D. in X-Files studies and Amitawith a Masters in Diana studies -surely making a mockery of science anddegrees in science.And Egan makes it pretty clear what we are tothink about Keith and Amita - beforewe leave for the Amok Evolution on theindonesian island of Teranesia.But somehow Egan doesn't manage to make theTeranesia amok evolutionanymore plausible than Keith andAmitas X files studies. I miss theoutrageous idea, that you find in so many ofhis other books, that makes you go""yeah, thats it. Thats right. Thats how it is going to be"".Here it is just plausible, but nothing more.You doubt the amok evolution plot a little as we go along,but are interested in the characters.Perhaps evolution in itself without the Eganaugmentation is simply more than weird enough?But still the book is an exciting read and wouldmake an excellent movie.-Simon"
3,Egan should stick with physics,"this is a pretty good book, and it's not hard to get through but egan really doesn't know much about molecular biology. if you don't either it may be enjoyable, otherwise be prepared for some problems. also it would have been cool to know how the virus thing he leads up to resolves itself."
3,"Incredibly promising, but...","...unfortunately not done nearly as well as it could have been. The characters are far better drawn than they have been in any previous Egan books, but the plot suffered. The ending is terrible. Nothing is resolved, nothing is connected from the story. Characters just disappear, without anything really explained.The idea behind the book, as it always is in what Egan writes, is fascinating. It could have been used far more than it was, however; I got the feeling that Egan rushed through the writing of the book. The typeface is rather large and only lasts for 320 pages - this book should have been a good 50% longer. More of the ideas should have been illustrated by things happening instead of through implausible long conversations between characters.""Teranesia"" is worth reading simply for the brilliant ideas behind the text. But it's not worth buying, especially not in hardcover, when it only takes a few hours to read. Get it from the library instead."
3,Not what I expected,"I have read a few books by Greg Egan, such as Distress. I expect some serious science and good character development.This book did not impress me at all. The story was somewhat interesting, but the conclusion was unsatisfying.The main theme seemed to be built on a guilt complex. I found the rationale for the character quite illogical, and I did not like it much."
5,Good stuff!,"Works great. I use it to cover my CGMS sensor sites, and it sticks wonderfully. It doesn't irritate me skin, doesn't turn to ""goo"" like IV3000 when I sweat. It sticks like glue, but peels off fairly easily."
4,Excellent Product,"Been using it for covering a very large wound I had from recent surgery,The only problem is that I wish it came in a 4"" or Larger size. All in all it is a great product!"
1,Puleeeeaaaase!,"These artists are what gives country music a bad name! Their sound is maudlin and overwrought, overdone phoney country - the kind of sound that a couple of city girls trying to ape rustic rural might produce. Puleeeaaassse, go back to the city girls!"
1,sorry... I tried,"I've heard nothing but great things about this record. But after five listens, the appeal completely escapes me.I'm not saying it's a bad record. But it's not connecting with me."
5,These Two Throw Darts,"Bean and Irwin are two of the sharpest writers going. On a zany cut like Queen Bee, it's funny rhymes and wordplay: '... way up in a hollow tree, perfect idolatry: little bees on their knees.' On regretful tune like Good for Nothing, it might be a telling image: 'Put the toys back in their boxes. Let me pull the ribbons off them one more time.' I've heard the gripes about their musicianship, they don't have Emmylou's pipes, and so on. For me, they put it across just fine. These songs stick with you."
5,Another classic from Freakwater,"This is an amazing CD. It's hard to believe that Freakwater has recorded 5 major releases with none showing any signs of weakness. Perhaps it is because they don't experiment with other sounds, and stick to the limiting traditional country/blues/bluegrass style. The most adventurous they've gotten has been to add more instruments to End Time, and this is a welcome addition. The string section on ""Raised Skin"" makes it even more spine-tingling than it would be alone."
2,Listen Before You Buy!,"OK- I read the reviews, heard the hype, bought the disc. I am disappointed, but that's what happens one reads customer reviews written by zealous fans. I also find it hard to grasp the use of the adjectives ""compelling"" and ""masterpiece"" by the professional reviewers. I describe their vocals as disjointed, campfire-like, enough to make the lyrics difficult to understand; the songs are mostly plodding, the arrangements simple and sloppy; I really did not hear any relationship between this music and any country or bluegrass traditions, except that the two female singers sing with a twang, and one of them sounds a little like Emmylou Harris' younger, but tone-deaf sister. When these two women sing together, it's just two unrehearsed and off key voices trying to stay on the same line. If I'm wrong about Freakwater, then I'm just used to hearing more professional performers."
1,Best of the Year?,"I had never heard of this band and bought the CD because it was on amazon's best of the year list.While I admit it's ""different"",I didn't find any of the songs particulary memorable or ear grabbing. They're sort of like a blugrass Indigo Girls but without the lock on the harmonies.Maybe next time I'll play thr realaudio clips when buying unknown artists."
1,408UNICORN14,THIS ITEM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BRAND NEW AND THE BOX WAS OPENED NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT...THANKS
1,Impossible to Read,"Now I know why this was shrink-wrapped in the stores, which made it impossible to look inside. But after getting the book and removing the shrink-wrap, it is nearly impossible to read. The layout is similar to ESPN's Magazine, with small colored print on top of colored background, pictures without captions, etc. This was supposed to be for my Dad, but at his age he won't be able to read this. Heck, I can barely read it, and I don't even wear glasses. I'll never buy a shrink-wrapped book again. I should have known better."
1,100 Years?,"Someone can't count, because I expected this book to cover ALL of the Yankees history, but the first seventeen years get a grand total of TWO pages! Unbelievable. Then, I start to read and find out that part of this book was written by Bill James, the guy that works for the RED SOX! A few nice pictures don't justify the price - about as good a bargain as Danny Tartabull or Ed Whitson were."
2,Not equal to the subject,"I'm sorry I had to buy this, because I have to buy everything about the Yankees and their anniversary. Although the pictures range from very good to spectacular, the book reads like it was written by committee. This is a sugar-coated history of the team, and not a very accurate one at that. You would have thought that a team that prides itself on being the greatest franchise in sports would have paid more attention to their own story and paid more respect to their fans, but the words here are strictly to fill up the pages. The official retrospective is just a picture book, and a very pricey one at that."
5,Iconic,This book has lots of interesting photos and some great history if you are interested in Germans from Russia. I will keep this in my collection.
3,Not a keeper,"I read the first Mackenzie books and enjoyed them thoroughly but this one was a huge disappointment. David and Cynthia just seemed to fall into bed without any emotional or even mental commitment (not that there's anything wrong with that!). It seemed to me that they never really developed any relationship beyond sex. Cynthia came across as shallow, plotting, and lacking in morals while David presented as a holier-than-thou hypocrite. Definitely not one of her best."
1,why do you need this?,Wats the point of getting this I beat the whole game in an hour. It was that easy. the bodys dont stay when the die which was stupid. and abouve all it showed who had killed u. that was horrible. game gets 4-5 book gets 1-5
4,Good effort,"Mami's album is a change from listening to my two favorite rai stars Faudel and Khaled in that it is a little faster and hipper in its sound. Mami does cnot have the voice that Khaled has, and his songs are more a sort of pop music than some of the powerful ballads that Khaled offers us such as Aisha or Wahrane. Beledi is a catchy pop tune that is fun to listen to. I saw Mami in concert in NY a few months ago and I firmly believe that the nice dance pace of his music lends itself more to a live show than sitting around at home listening to this music. I would recommend this album to people who are already familiar with rai music and want to hear an artist other than Khaled, Faudel or Taha. For those who want to discocer the sounds of rai for the first time, I would recommend starting with Sahra or Les Trois Soleils- a live album with Taha, faudel and Khaled."
4,A Fun New Series,"In 1920s Melbourne pilot and daredevil Phryne Fisher is employed ot investigate a young woman's mysterious illness. It seems that her husband might be slowly poisoning her. Fisher camps out in a luxury hotel and befriends a couple of precocious cabbies, who help her solve the mystery. Quickly Phryne is drawn into the Melbourne underworld, looking to uncover the source of the cocaine trade, as well as an illegal abortionist who is butchering young women.I had no idea what to expect from this book, and I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are delightfully eccentric. Phryne gets up to all sorts of antics, and there are plenty of descriptions of 1920s high society. The mystery was also intriguing, as there was no one obvious suspect. Overall, I found this book to be quite satisfactory, and I will read more of the series."
4,Flapper in the Outback,"This was a light and breezy mystery as befits the era it portrays. I can't imagine why, but I expected a little more P G Wodehouse flavor."
2,Couldn't finish the book,"Cocaine Blues by Kerry Greenwood did not grab my interest at all. I couldn't finish the book. It was lacking detail, and it felt like the writing was immature. While I've read several good reviews of the Phryne Fisher series, the character seemed flat and uninteresting."
1,Disappointing,"I got this book for free (for my kindle) and it, sadly, turned out to be worth every penny paid."
2,Wasn't my style,This book is not bad really it is just not my kind of story. It was too ruff and jagged for me. I prefer a lighthearted cozy mystery and this was not that at all.
3,"Good Start, Then Disappointing","I thought this mystery began delightfully enough, then it became so very contrived and unrealistic--kind of like Wonder Woman in the 20ies, Down Under. I will probably try one more Phryne Fisher, and then give up if it doesn't get any better."
4,1st in series,"This is not the best book in the series, but it is lots of fun. Keep reading, they get better."
2,Pleasant Period Piece,An enjoyable period piece fluff. Not my taste at all and I wouldn't read more by this author. Mindless as far as mysteries go.
3,Cocaine Blues Causes the Blues,"My recent reading of Cocaine Blues often left me bored and made me sorry that I had opted to read this book. The characters were quite uninteresting, and the story plodded along. I certainly would not recommend it to anyone and will not read any of the other titles in this series."
4,"Different, but a good read.","This is a good read. It is different than I expected, but I enjoyed reading it. Another good Amazon selection."
4,Phryne's first -,"The first book in any series usually takes a while to get my attention and that is the case with this one. However, don't give up. These books are jewels just waiting to be discovered. Phryne Fisher is a heroine who makes her own rules and lives by her own standards. She's absolutely delightful."
5,Wonderful!,The Phyrne Fisher mysteries are an absolute delight. I can't wait to devour every book in the series.
3,Period Feminist meets Chick Lit meets Mystery/Crime,"The Phryne Fisher series came highly recommended by a man not usually given to Affirmative Action crits, but I can't help feeling that if this had been written by a bloke . . .Female readers may well enjoy the anachronistic cheap shots at Twenties' inequalities, and God knows there could be worse heroines for the Noughties. (Or do we call the present decade the Oh-Ohs?)Lovers of crime fiction will surely be disappointed, and not only by the fact that the King of Snow was obvious from the start. This is an amateurish effort, best illustrated by having the members of a White Russian noble family speak French (rather than Russian) when alone with each other in private, the better to be eavesdroppedupon by our French-speaking heroine.It's not bad wordsmithery, as you might expect of a lawyer who moonlights as an author, but I'm guessing most male readers will not find this enough."
3,A pleasant diversion.,I usually read mysteries and thrillers that are more serious in tone ...i.e. Michael Connelly..Alan Furst....Frank Tallis.I found the heroine delightful..charming.. The place and time made the story more interesting since the mystery itself wasn't much of a mystery.
3,Katerate,This book was okay. I personally didn't care that much for the writing style but it did hold my interest.
3,Australian Flapper Folly,"I was looking forward to discovering a new voice in the period piece mystery genre; but was disappointed in this one. Reviews that I had read implied that Kerry Greenwood was the Australian Agatha Christie. Not so, her flapper sleuth is just a little too self centered and selfish to be attractive. The improbability of the plot stretches credulity, the shallow characterization is unbelievable; and although set in Melbourne, is so lacking in atmosphere that it could be about Chicago. The only authentic Aussie flavor was in the street names and the obvious reversal of the seasons one encounters when going ""down under"". I will try one more title before I give this author up as a poor substitute for the real thing."
3,"total Mary Sue, but fun","Phryne is pure wish fulfillment. The character can eat everything but stay slim and perfect as a model, never sweat from exercise but stay strong and lean, spend all the money she wants and never run out, have lots of lots of great sex without physical or emotional consequences, read and speak in many languages, drive and fly at high speed without accident, outsmart any opponent, always show perfect taste, deliver the subtle conversational riposte at exactly the right moment . . . .But who wouldn't like a little wish fulfillment now and then? Even though I am more fond of characters with a few human flaws, it works for James Bond, so why not Phryne Fisher?"
2,"Good start, but it's all downhill from here","The first entry in a long-running Australian series. This book is deeply flawed -- the climactic scene revolves, not around wits or daring, but a public display of affection -- but it's one of the few high points in the series. Phryne is charming, brilliant and amoral, and would be almost likable if the narrative wasn't continually telling us how special and remarkable she is. It's hard to generate tension around a character for whom the normal rules of society don't apply. However, the Jazz Age Australia setting is well-realised, and this is an entertaining start to a series best enjoyed as part of a drinking game."
2,"no closed caption, weaving hard to understand","Interesting that they'd leave off closed-captioning.Otherwise, I bet this would have been a superb flick.Without it, it isn't.Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count."
1,meh,"this case looks cool but it comes apart so easily- i barely move it and it's sliding apart. i don't think this could protect my iPod as well as the clear case i bought. this is probably for someone who only listens to music sitting down, not moving around or working out.i would not recommend this product to someone else."
1,"What a Dreary, Ponderous Book...","It is hard to pin down what i don't like about this book. Is it the dry, sketchy writing style? Is it the faux-mystical overtones? Is it the dearth of likable characters?Radix was difficult to get into, but Sumner Kagan quickly emerged as a formidable anti-hero, defending himself against street gangs in devious and deadly ways. But Attanasio isn't content to stay in the grimy city, where things are interesting. She wants to lift Sumner to Godhood, so we must follow Kagan into the wilderness and through his many changes. What a load of crap.I struggled to stay awake while finishing this book, and not even the final meeting with the Delph was enough to hold my interest."
5,Transparent and inflexible center of the diamond of time,"The ""A.A"" stands for Alfred Angelo, so I don't think it's a female. I love this book. His wonderful use of language alone is just amazing. I've never read anything remotely like it."
4,Gloria Vanderbilt afloat,"I will never again use the Yachting Ensign in place of the US Ensign at the stern. Nor will you if you read this book. Boaters, all, please take note."
1,Must have,"This book makes an excellent paper weight and only lacks appeal when opened and read. The ""author"" of this book would do best to seek another career path. This text is by far one of the most dry and uninteresting things I have read to date."
5,Cultura Profética is so refreshing to the ears,"Ehm It's just hard to put in words what it feels to listen to this band live. I did when I was in Ponce, they put a show for the university games (sport stuff) it was packed. I wasn't a fan of reggae until I stood speechless listening to how they fluidly changed from song to song non-stop. It's a great show... they give themselves out to the crowd like no other."
4,Tripod Strap - Does the Job - Room for Improvement Though.,"Nice design, nice built. Lightweight, looks solid and professional although mostly plastic-made. Not shoulder-compatible, that's too bad but really convenient to carry a tripod by hand!"
5,458HL Tripod Strap,"This Bogen-Manfrotto 458HL Tripod Strap works well for hand carrying the tripod short distances, and also provides something solid to grab hold of on the tripod. It clips onto 2 metal loops each end of thetripod column, and at one end wraps around the tripod legswith a quick connect fastener.The handle is molded into the strap and is rigid witha rubbery grip. This strap is not intended for carrying the tripod over the shoulder.I purchased it at BH, they seem to have the best prices and lowest shipping costs for Bogen Manfrotto products."
2,Is not what it seems to be,"I bought this strap for mine Manfrotto 055XPROB because i saw some other straps before and i like the idea of not wearing a bag but having a comfortable way to trasport your tripod in the trips.But this strap become to be nothing but a handle, because is so small that you can cross your arm beneath.I will look for another strap, even not a Manfrotto one, because this one i will put it into the trash can."
4,delicious help!!,My daughter was just recently diagnosed with Celiac's disease and was very depressed about the prospect of limited foods. This cookbook helped her to realize that life and eating go on. She took several items from the cookbook with her to Holiday parties and everyone enjoyed them. thanks!
4,"great recipe, elaborate list of ingredients",I also have her bread book and they both are really great IF you have the ability and time to gather all the ingredients. Or if you cab substitute ingredients well for one another. Worth buying if you are gluten free and want to learn how to get use to cooking without gluten containing ingredients.
5,Book,This is a great book! I bought this for a gift and it was really loved! Would definately buy this again for the gluten free...it's a must!
4,Almost perfect,"The only problem I had with this company is how slowly the book actually got to me. It was after Christmas and several books that I ordered later from places farther away got here before it did. The book is in great condition, though!"
3,"Looks good, but nutrient counts are way off!!","The recipes in this book look really appealing and probably are delicious, BUT . . . the calorie/carb/fat, etc. counts that accompany each recipe are wildly inaccurate. For example, the Featherlight Chiffon Cake shows 170 calories per serving with 160 grams of carbohydrates. At four calories per gram, there couldn't be less than 640 calories per serving!! Her Cream Cheese Pound Cake shows only 5 grams each of carb and protein and 9 grams of fat. This must total about 120 cals per serving, but she lists it as 288 cals. per serving. In fact, almost every recipe I looked at carefully had unreliable numbers attached. Here's hoping the editors correct these errors before going to a second edition."
2,Plenty of unhelpful recipes,"This book has some good information and recipes... but there's a lot that are sort of a joke/waste of space. I don't need this sort book to contain recipes that are naturally gluten-free like salads and chili, etc. There is also a tendency to include recipes like Mac and Cheese but the way that it becomes gluten-free is the recipe states that you use gluten-free macaroni (duh). The recipes for things like homemade pasta and bread are much more useful."
5,Bette's Best Chicken Pot Pies are awesome!!,"I love Bette Hagman's books, and this one is my absolute favorite. it takes some time to prep the flour mixes (unless you just buy something similar), and also to make the biscuit mix, but it's well worth it to keep on hand, because the chicken pot pies are SO good!! way better than any ""regular"" ones I'd ever had. this is my go-to dish to make for company, as everyone loves it and we can all eat gluten-free together!"
3,good but not great!,"I am a hugh fan of Betty Hagman and own all her books. I also own an artisan style organic bakery! I was challenged to try GF baking and until I found Betty, well to put it nicely, the only one eating GF at Serious Sourdough was the compost bin! All that changed with her Bread Book! At last, I found yeast breads that worked. Better texture and taste, and some nutrition too. I have baked almost all the way thru her bread book, only altering salt, and some flavor combinations not suited to my Austin Texas clients! So when I found this one I did not hesitate to get it. I am very disapointed with this book. Really the only recipe I have used and continue to use is the Teff Graham Bread, but for my ever increasing Teff Bread fans, it alone is worth the price of the book! If you are looking for baking recipes, get her bread and dessert books. Both are wonderful. Jean Brooks, owner Serious Sourdough Bakery"
4,Great book lots of info,I like the book... think it will give lots of good cooking ideas. Would hope that there would be more lower fat glueten free choices though.
5,Gluten free muffins and more.,"If you want to add variety to a gluten-free diet, this book is for you. Includes recipes for bread, muffins, waffles and more."
4,good info,"The Gluten-Free Gourmet Cooks Comfort Foods: Creating Old Favorites with the New FloursHas an introduction with a review of many of the substitute flours (and their attributes, nutty, bland etc.) that gluten-free cooks use. Also gives info bits on how to use and inter-mix the different ingredients for different effects (lighter, denser baking etc.) Besides a good variety of recipes, lists places that supply these ingredients."
3,New way of cooking,"Hard to change old habits, but this will be a helpful book. I will try more recipes and hope its easier."
3,okay,"There was little in this book I tried out. The main issue was the ingredients - many recipes contained things I had never heard of or that are unavailable or hard to obtain in New Zealand. I.e Sorghum flour, apple pie spice, etc. Also I think American and New Zealand foods are different, so I wasn't drawn to the complicated recipes preferring instead simple, fresh ingredients. In saying all that, there was one recipe I did like - the home-made egg noodles. I make our own pasta and my family particularly enjoy that."
3,Mixed Bag,This is not one of Gene Wolfes better collections. Some of the stories were entertaining and others weren't. One thing that really ruined it for me was the tiny print size. The book is long and the print is tiny it was just no fun to read. If you can avoid the mass market version you'll be much better off.
1,A Deep Boredom,"Almost no Science Fiction in that book. A collection of stories that quickly got me bored. I even lost hope of finding anything of interest by the middle of the book. And I was proved right; it went on worse and worse. Now I realised I should have written my review right after my reading (I read it three months ago) because I can't even remember anything notable that I could report here. Yet, a word still lingers in my mind: surrealism... For what it's worth."
3,not upfront,"Ordered this as a last minute gift. Advertised as new- then after the date it was supposed to have been shipped, got an email from the seller that it was actually used. I asked for a price adjustment based on the changed information but then sent a second email telling them to just send it as it was needed quickly. The seller never altered the price and actually charged more for shipping than what was stamped on the sent package. The book was fine and made a good gift for a Diego Rivera lover, but I felt the seller was not customer friendly therefore I will not be buying from them again."
3,"Good food, but cans all dented","I like Hatch's Tex-Mex style enchilada sauce, but these were obviously damaged during manufacturing and packed in a flat for commercial use. All 12 of the cans showed some dents, but the dents were on the inner sides, so the damage was done before shrink-wrapping, not during Amazon's shipping. I will use them, but don't think Amazon should be getting ""seconds"" for sale."
2,caused dizziness and nausea,"I tried this product because a friend highly recommended it for sore throats. I used it once and could tell it would be helpful. BUT after using it I became extremely dizzy - this lasted about 10 hours, diminishing as time went on. I also felt nauseous and very hot and my face became flushed and heated. This was after just one spritz! I looked up the ingredients and found that PEG-40 (hydrogenated) castor oil, when in vapor or finely-misted, causes dizziness and nausea (as well as eye irritation). It is rated as moderately to highly hazardous by the Environmental Working Group. So this could be a good product but I would recommend avoiding it unless the PEG-40 castor oil is taken out. I really did feel extremely sick and wish I hadn't tried it."
2,Multiple Errors throughout. Needs to be re-edited,"I initially thought the book would be quite useful. After using to prepare for the PANCE, my classmates and I found many errors in the information. There were answers which were mislabeled as well as answers which were flat out incorrect. An example is its answer to ""what is the most common hernia in females"", it states the answer is ""femoral"", which is incorrect. Femoral is more common in females, but inguinal hernias remain the most common in both sexes. At this time, this text will cause confusion in a diligent student. At worst, it will cause a student to learn incorrect information. Perhaps the next version will be more accurate."
4,priceless study guide,"Use this guide along with Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment, plus a comprehensive board review course and you'll pass everytime. My husband and I ,both very specialized P.A.'s, have passed 3 times each ,plus the additional surgical boards, and are now getting ready for the 4th round! There have been questions on the exam that were right from the book EVERY TIME!! So, the above new grads are indignant about the occasional misinformation, but the reality is that this is a GUIDE not a bible, and that one must study TO the exam-which is rarely a reflection of practice."
2,Timely but poor condition,"I received this book promptly but it was in very poor condition. The description stated it was in ""good"" condition, but it had torn pages, bent pages, water damage through half of it, filled in answers in the practice questions and mysterious ""crumbs"" in it (probably snot). VERY VERY disappointing."
2,NOT HONEST,idiot sells a question and answer book but doesn't mention the answers are already circled......would NOT buy from this seller.....NOT HONEST!the only reason he has two stars is because the delivery time was prompt
1,App;etpn and Lang Review for Physician Assistant,The book is in good condition. The CDwith the review quesstions arrived broken in half. I was VERY disapointed
5,Outstanding!!!,This 4th edition has over 75% new material and a practice exam CDthat provides computer based exam just like the PANCE and PANRE.Well worth the money.
2,not acceptable,"I bought the fourth edition this past winter to study for the PANRE. Overall, it had some good information, however, there were far too many mistakes in the book to be acceptable. I wonder if this book was ever reviewed or edited prior to publishing! There were so many mistakes that I became uncertain of whether information I was studying was accurate or not. The mistakes ranged from simple typographical errors to contradictory answers in different parts of the book. There were so many errors in the psychiatry section that I simply stopped reading that section all together. I hope the 5th edition has gone through better proofreading and editing so that it may be more useful to those studying for the exam. But until then, I would definitely by-pass this book as a study guide."
3,First Ebook,Wish I would have got the E book because of the need to go back and forth. Answers all corect and you pick the most correct. This may be like real life but it is not the format the exam follows
2,WOULDNT DEPEND ON THIS GUIDE,just took PANRE last week and have to say this IS NOT a good review guide. Although beneficial for some general medicine questions there were alot of questions that were not located anywhere in this guide. PLEASE don not solely depend on this guide for recertification process and suggest combining other guides to reeducate yourself on adult and pediatric medicine.
4,Good review but LOTS of errors,"Am using this book again for re-cert and have found significant errors in the explanations - mainly in typos but also in its own contradiction of the answer vs explanation. This is a great way for me to study - just a TON of questions, but you have to research the answers if you know something is askew and look closely to make sure the answer coincides with the question."
3,"Useful, but far from perfect","This book basically sumarizes all the major topics in a very organized way. There are lots of typos, but basically reliable information. I felt it was more thorough than the AAPA review manual, but it does not come with any way to assess your progress, which I missed. I used this is a supplement to my AAPA review manual. The combination of the two books must have worked well, because I scored extremely well on my PANCE!!"
4,Pretty Good Review,"The review is a pretty good general review! The only problem I had is that there arent as many questions as i would like, nor did the software work on windows 7."
2,"OK, not great","I have edition 4 and just took the PANRE. This edition has some errors as stated in other reviews, which is a bit frustrating when you are panicked and trying to cram for the Boards. It contains a lot of zebras and goes more in depth than you'll be tested on in the PANRE, so it might be good for the PANCE. A better book that reflects the PANRE more accurately is the Zarbock book. Also, I couldn't open the practice test that is on the included CD, it may have been my computer acting up again, but since I was able to open other tests it makes me wonder if the writers of this CD have not made it user friendly (or dummy proof). By the way, I abandoned this book and stuck to the Zarbock book, passed my Boards with a considerable margin, and would say that you can skip this book and probably still be OK for the PANRE."
2,Perfect for those with insomia,"I think that Ann Rule is talking her fans for granted. Thinking she can just put out anything and we will buy it. For the most part she is correct because I for one, buy it. From now on though, I will think twice. ""Last Dance"" is a mish mash of boredom and the stories that follow are old and moldy."
3,Not as good as I expected,"This did not live up to the Ann Rule legacy, I had trouble finishing this book. I look forward to better reads in the future."
3,Debbie a Victim?,"Well written and interesting...but the main ""victim"" Debbie, comes off more like an accomplice, than the Angel that Ms. Rule intended for her to appear like. So much rang false for me."
5,Keep on Ann,"I loved this book & have already read it several times. Tragic story about an incompetent, egoistic, narcissic doctor who killed one of his patients and who gave his wife such huge quatities of arsenic that it was a miracle that he did not kill her (even though he tried extremely hard).It appears that even after so many years the ""doctor"" has not finished with his wife at all & has ways of keeping track of and disturbing his family even from prison. What I want to know is how this guy, Pignataro, was able to review this book. He is in prison, and hopefully will stay there, and should have no access to internet? After seeing how this guy breaks the rules, I believe that his family is afraid of him & I believe that some of the nastier reviews that critise his wife have been put on here by him. A gripping read as are the other true crime cases included in this book. A great book"
1,A MONSTER WHO LOOKS LIKE A HUMAN,"I could not put this book down. Ann Rule has done it again. It had to be hard to write the chilling tale of torture and attempted murder. The author has made it possible for anyone to see the hideous mask of ""Tony"". Anyone accept his mother, who has cut off her two grandchildren and still idolizes her son. Unbelievable that she is still working to free him. Ann has put all of this down in such detail that you could almost see 'Tony' as Dorian Gray. The man that looked so handsome 25 years ago and the painting that now showed all of his twisted evil. Thank you Ann for another block buster of a book. I will be a fan for life."
4,Ann Rule's quality is so high--why bother with other true crime authors?,"Ann Rule not only covers her materials carefully and accurately, her writing style maintains the reader's interest throughout. Her writing draws you in and holds you. This review could be endlessly repeated for all her books."
3,thinking of cosmetic surgery? read this book!,"'Last Dance, Last Chance"" is yet another of Ann Rule's collection of true crime stories, dominated by one major story followed by several smaller ones. Personally I think these collections don't show off the author's skills very well, and they seem a bit formulaic ... yet Ann Rule continues to pump them out at a rate of one per year.In this book the main story is about a very disturbed young doctor and his long suffering wife. The man is not only a rotten physician but also a horrible husband/father. After repeated failures at entering into specialized medicine he hangs a shingle in front of his office and instantly becomes a cosmetic surgeon (..from hell). You can imagine the rest. But you cannot imagine how this insecure, rotten individual takes out his frustration on his family. Fascinating horror ... it can only be real.Bottom line: enjoyable but not memorable Ann Rule material. Yet surely her fans should and will read it."
4,I love Ann Rule Books,"Always a good read for me, keeps me on the edge of my seat. I wish she would write something new."
2,too big,"Although I take a large in every other kind of glove imaginable, these were too big, considerably, in large. The velcro around the wrist is also poorly designed. Unless you have enormous wrists, you have to use every last bit of velcro to close the gloves. I'm sure the Medium would've been much better for me. The quality of leather is the only part that's very good."
4,Nice looking wheel covers,"I purchased these wheel covers for my new Pontiac G5. I wanted something to enhance the appearance since it did not come with nice looking wheels, and I did not want to spend a lot of money. They look great. I do have to be careful not to hit hard pumps for fear they will fall off, they are not bolt on like the oem wheel covers. I check them often, so far so good. I will be purchasing a set of wheels soon, but for now they were a good investment for under 30.00."
1,Not well made,I only wore this ring a few times and one of the teeny tiny diamonds fell out. I doubt I will ever wear it again. This is very disappointing - my husband gave this to me for my 1st mother's day and garnet is my daughter's birthstone.
4,Marilyn Lives On,"This book should have been published in a large tome as the photographs are truly unique and beautiful portraying Monroe in the last year of her life. The photos shows MM in bed as the ultimate fantasy. Photographer Douglas does his subject justice and the Marilyn one sees is the eternal playful, wistful woman child that the world fell in love with."
2,Not Very Informative.,Has some good topics discussed. Would not recommend this book as a starter in labor law.
1,I don't know about this one!?!,"Well, I would like to start off by saying, they aren't the worst band i've ever seen. This Album by Mercy River, entittled ""Climbing"" unfortunately has the same idea throughout the entire album. All of the songs have the same basic vocal patter, and follow a very non-complex music riffs, and beats. The drummer also seems to enjoy beating the hell out of drums, because there is no dynamics involved in his playing. They are also, unfortunately, very improfessional, and aren't very supportive of other bands within' there are. They are a bit self-centered in there attitudes on stage. They are very cool guy's, i had a chance to speak with them at a show in Phili, unfortunately sooooo cool, that they couldn't bother taking the time out to talk. Little did they know that i was a producer from Sony Records. Unfortunately, they aren't cool enough to pull off this album."
2,nothing special,"I bought this CD after hearing about this band from friends. Well, the CD isn't bad... but its pretty darn ordinary. To me, Mercy River sounds like they are trying too hard to be taken seriously. I was a little dissappointed because they sound like all the other ""Matchbox 20 wannabe's"" that have proliferated the late 90's. Maybe its formula that works for the masses, but I need a little more originality."
5,Great Listening!,"Climbing is an awesome album. The lyrics are well written and the music is of course great! The album has so many great tracks, I can't choose a favorite. This CD is a must for anyone who skipping through songs!!!"
5,"Fantastic ""new"" band!!!","Mercy River is by far the best ""new"" band to come around in a while. Climbing shoud be a huge hit. They have songs that are not only easy to relate to, but don't song like everything else out there already. Their sound is rich, captivating, and leaves you wishing for more!"
5,This is AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"I have been following Mercy River for a few years now, and I saw them at the LIVE concert in August of '97 (in Camden, NJ). One of the main reasons that I wanted to go to the concert is because they were going to be playing on the side stage. Since I began following them (before '97), they have changed some members, and I think it was for the better. ""Climbing"" blows their older CD, ""Bog"", out of the water. ""Wannabe"" has to be my favorite song from both CDs. I hope to see the band get more publicity and go national. Help them out...buy ""Climbing""....IT ROCKS!!!!!!"
3,Not quite as expected.,"I purchased these to compliment and finish out a self made surround sound and complimenting my other Yamaha speakers and a Yamaha 673 AV Receiver. My 3 star rating is for spring loaded clips in stead of the screw type. I was lead to believe the speakers built for U.S. use were of the screw type. Other than that, the sound is of good quality...for the price I paid for them.I would recommend these."
2,pieces missing,"Few things are more disappointing than having your package arrive, starting to assemble and find that pieces are missing. Though I read other reviews stating that things were missing, I figured I would be luckier and not have that situation.Nope...things were missing. This was a gift for our son and we were all disappointed when we couldn't play basketball on Easter.Next time will take other reviewers comments more seriously."
2,Ms.,the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and couldn't be used. A new one had to be purchased.
3,product is pretty nice.,"Overall, I am happy with this product, and it is definitely good for the amateur to intermediate photographer. It does what they claim it will."
5,Exceptional Quality and Presentation,"I received this book from my WM and Secretary last night, what a treasure! The quality and presentation are excellent. There's pages with room to record all your important dates and information, as well as family genealogy and information. Lots of study helps and general masonic information as well, I'm very impressed. A must have for any new MM."
2,Very Superficial,"If you know the basic story, you're not going to learn anything here. Eight Men Out is a much better account of the 1919 World Series and there are better biographies of Shoeless Joe. Also, this is the only historical work I can ever recall reading that did not contain citaions for all of the quotes. The author also has an unusual manner of using quotes."
1,Simply awful,Nothing more than sappy baseball nostalgia masquerading as a biography. Totally useless.
2,Read the TEXT BOOK! THE GIVEN MATERIAL IS WAY TOO EASY!,"Like I said, read your text book! Waste of money!"
2,different and cool but not my kind of music,"after hearing homb i really liked it. well not the last 20min song. only the eirie mood setting 1st track and omphalos.i think i listened to crash my moon yacht one time and wasnt my thing.i tried this one and its just too wierd for me. i found traces of sigur ros like girls singing but theres no structure (verse chorus verse) to the songs. the guy that sings cant sing too good either. just yelling stuff out. the intermission track was interesting. well its a story of a judge and a chipmunk? well, you gotta hear it to understand. hehe.this is not something i would listen to over and over."
1,terrible customer support,"The trampoline was delivered in February in a damaged box with many parts missing. The users manual says to contact Variflex (Berlyn)directly instead of place of purchase, which we did. It took several weeks and several follow up calls before the replacements were finally sent. When we finally started to assemble the trampoline we found defective springs and mismatched support poles for the safety enclosure leading to round two of calls and delays. We've owned the trampoline for nearly three months now and are still unable to use it. Anyone who wants to actually use the equipment they purchase should avoid Variflex. We surely will."
1,Avoid this Trampoline!,"The package arrived broken with missing pieces. After contacting their customer service, it took months to receive the missing pieces. After receiving them, a spring and two rods were still defective. We have requested these pieces again from customer service and so far we have not received them---we are told the pieces are on back order. In other words, it has been four months since we purchased the trampolibne and we have not been able to use it. After our experiences with the customer service of Variflex, I recommend staying away from this product and company."
4,Evangelism is Very Personal,"If you have interest in your own need for salvation, then more than likely you have the interest in seeing others get saved and stay saved as well. This book will help you to accomplish goals for producing disciples for Christ.According to McRaney's common sense principles, ""People are responsive and receptive to us when we consistently display interest in them"" pg. 176This book will surely help us to maintain a healthy attitude towards doing evangelism.If you desire to be effective in increasing the kingdom of God through effective witnessing, then you must read this book to obtain the knowledge you need to be successful at evangelizing the world for Christ."
3,Focuses on relational dimensionnof sharing Christ on us.,Contains all the necessary principles in relational evangelism. Doesn't discuss handling objections. Good discussion on the difference between witnessing to men and women.
3,Comprehenise Doesn't Always Mean Good.,"I bought this book because I needed to learn Sharepoint Portal Server 2003. I'm in Chapter 8 and I can honestly say, it could've been written more consisly. Sure there is a lot of information regarding installation, planning, which I feel the Installation section should've been left out or in another book altogether. But, it is a resource guide so I suppose it's not totally out of place. The way it was written is sometimes very verbose and sometimes a small paragraph has to be read again to get the understanding the author tries to make. I am going to read this book because I need to learn the system, and I bought it, however, for those of you who are looking to read about Sharepoint Portal Server 2003 and Windows Sharepoint Services, well, you may want to try another book."
2,Layout and Lack of Critical Info Hamper,"This book is like the 'Da Vinci Code' for SharePoint. It has a lot of information. A LOT OF INFORMATION. The problem is, the layout and order of presentation in the book make it almost impossible to read and find information. Loading the included disk is a requirement. Use the PDF and search electronically for the information because the printed index is incredibly lacking.Because it is so hard to find stuff, one thinks that MS is trying to hide information or that critical information was left out.Good resource, but be prepared for a continent spanning search for information that will takes days, leave you bedraggled, and make you think you've solved centuries old mysteries once you finally find what you are looking for. Pack lightly, carry currency, and perhaps a firearm (for the book, share point machine, self, your choice)."
3,Good reference but overly wordy,"This is in fact a good referece for SharePoint. My biggest complaint is that it is overly wordy without adding anything. You won't be disappoint in this book; however, don't be surprized when you find yourself skipping ahead because of word dribbling."
2,Disappointing News,I picked this poster for my office.A colleague reminded me that Paul Gauguin exploited the natives in Tahiti and gave them all VD.Sigh.
4,"Filled with Heart, Wonderful Read","Though this was a typical tale of broken-hearted man and fresh-faced miss, it is so well written that it became new again! It even portrayed the raising of the children during that time so well (sometimes seen but never heard)! St. Clair's personality wonderfully came alive. Even his changing nature at the end was brilliant because after all - he was struggling against his own nature. Kate was a nice change of pace too. Fresh faced, plain speaking daughter of an Irish doctor, you knew she would be lively. All the secondary characters and stories were well thought-out and were enjoyable too.A realistic tale where everyone acted mature (even high-spirited Kate knew when to hold her tongue) and very evenly told. Do not miss this one!!"
2,disappointed by cover,"I have seen this book in stores and love it, however when i ordered it it arrived without the beautiful cover its famous for and which i expected from the product description it would have. The content, i presume, is still the same and therefore makes it a great reference book but i was very disappointed it didn't have the beautiful white pleated paper cover."
5,A Must Read,"An outstanding overview. As a practicing strategic management consultant, I found this book both rich on inspiration and on detail."
1,Not the paperback version,"This is a paperback, but it's a study guide, not the original text - buyer beware!"
4,"Mintzberg v. Porter, et.al. but especially Porter","For a summary of the book, I'd recommend Mr. Gerard Kroese's review elsewhere on this page. It is fair and accurate. What I find most entertaining about this work is the authors' (Mintzberg's mostly) masterful deconstruction of Professor Porter's positioning models. Mintzberg has spent the past 25 years railing against them, seeing them as altogether static sieves through which reality is filtered. An effective strategy, Mintzberg argued in ""Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning"" is one that interacts with and engages its environment. I'd put myself in the ""environmental school"" as Mintzberg characterizes that perspective in this book.Most of all, this book is well-written, as is most of Mintzberg's work, and is filled with such whimsy as a serious book strategic management can muster."
3,Useful in a limited sense,Academic stuff made friendly by good writing. It's a survey of the schools of thought in strategy research. IT WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES. It is useful in that it will help you determine the weaknesses inherent in the foundation of a strategy prescription IF you are aware of the foundations employed by the strategy prescriber. Got it?
5,excellent,This product was received in excellent condition very quickly ... helps a struggling college person keep within budget!THANK YOU!
4,A comprehensive guide to understanding strategy in all its perspectives,"Ever wondered which strategy framework to apply when? Ever wondered why some theories on strategy always seem to contradict some other equally popular theory? Been confused with questions that you did not know who to ask? Turn to this book. The way I did. And you will find answers to most of your questions.This is truly a good guide to understand the various schools of thought regarding Strategy. An understanding of this provides one with a better appreciation of the generic and situational nature of Strategy, rather than being bogged down by the various contradicting theories. A good book to establish the contextual boundaries of strategy, and a must not only as a read, but also as a part of your collection."
1,"""Strategy Safari"" on the Kindle DX","Ok, I got the Kindle version and was reading it on the DX but it was quite horrible. Lists and tables are not formatted properly, hence all the texts just get lumped together, which makes it really hard to read through the bulleted points; the bullets don't exist and there is no line break to seperate each points from each other. Diagrams (i.e. images) are blur and pixelated; they are probably meant for use on the Kindle 1 & 2 where the screen resolution is smaller. Lastly, text boxes appears without border lines, hence you would most like get confused when the paragraph suddenly changed subject. Stay away from the Kindle version if possible. Oh, and the first chapter should have 4 figures but they are all missing in the Kindle version. You make the call whether to buy the Kindle version."
1,nothing........no improvement,It does ABSOLUTELY ZERO nothing.no improvementdoes not even help local weak stations
3,Metra 44-UA60 AM/FM Signal Amplifier w/ Bypass Switch,"I Installed this with a new Sony CDX-GT110 radio/cd to boost the reception of the local npr channel. It seems to help a little, I do live under an escarpment though. If I turn it off the reception changes a little, maybe it would make a bigger difference for others. It does help though.ACG"
1,Useless,"This product did not work, the only thing that it amplified was static. Total waste of effort."
3,"Works, but limited","Works well on the one item it is attached to, but does not address the issue of total ""screen time,"" just the amount of time spent on that one item."
2,Have the right equipment,I wasn't too keen on this product. All the TV's I have in my house do not completely shut off and continue to suck electricity so this product does not work. The company does warn you but I wasn't sure if my TV's were included in that. Now I know. I might be able to give a better opinion if I had a TV it worked on.
4,Their best effort for the ep era,"Firstly the tracks on this cd are1. destroy the robots2. pickles3. it is as it was4. I'll sell you suicide5. futureless6. destroy the humansThe first 2 songs on this ep are argueably the best put out by this band, a great balance between musicality and making accessible music. The next 3 songs are fairly solid too and delve a bit more into their unusual side combining acoustic with heavier riffs. The final song is a throwaway of silence and noises.Overall great ep and its a shame no albums have been released yet comprising the best of all the eps and singles."
2,Return product,"This is not how the product looked so would you say it is being misrepresented? Only 4 movies played and the others I believe were a region code other than U.S. I was very disappointed because I wanted this to be part of my movie collection. I believe it was an honest mistake but it cost me money to send it back, very disappointing."
4,Lucid introduction,"Lucid and clear introduction to algebraic number theory, in style very much like the author's other book on Galois theory. Very elementary though, doesn't cover any analytic method, nor gives even a taste of class field theory, besides the problem set is less than challenging. But the book serves its purpose well, strongly recommended for beginners."
3,"Not bad, but much to be improved.","I entirely agree with the review by Mr T. Luo. In the parts I and II, there exist many logical gaps in the exposition that require a substantial amount of effort to fill in. If this book is used as a textbook in a class, that may prove pedagogically benefiting. But self-studying newcomers to the subject will find the textbook hard to follow. I must add that there are many typos concerning fraktur, especially in chapter 5, which makes the reading frustrating."
5,A different look at WWII,My husband and I enjoyed watching this mini series very much. Thinking of the war from the Islanders eyes made us curious about how it would have been there. We read up on it. TV that is enjoyable to watch and helps you learn something is always a toofer. And for another good series about WWII be sure to watch Foyle's War.
2,Disappointed,"Ok if you just want to see boobies of hot girls doing stuff you can get this. I was expecting more. It is fairly tame. I wasn't expecting hardcore, but this is really tame. In the shower scene, body painting scene and human sundae scenes the girls leave their bikini bottoms on. In the skinny dipping scene, you girls who are completely naked hide under water the whole time. I think I saw one bush the whole movie. It just wasn't a very hot dvd."
5,New Age Spirituality - An Introduction,"I give Academy of the Soul five stars because it reaches its goal with excellence. Americans are a busy people. Many have little time to read, but still they are searching for answers to spiritual questions. And the goal of this compact book is to explain, in simple, clear terms the major premises of what many call the New Age movement. A walker on the New Age path can use Academy of the Soul for meditation. Or give it as a gift to someone curious about what New Age means but who has little time or inclination to read long, densely written texts or even popular but still very long books. The use of beautiful art to enhance the text also excellently evokes the mood and tenor of this movement. And if the reader's curiosity is seriously whetted, extensive notes and bibliography at the back will guide them to key New Age references for further exploration."
2,"Standard, Uneventful Set","Fleer's ""Traditions"" card line never impressed me in its earlier incarnations, so I wasn't expecting much from this season's set. Needless to say, I wasn't let down. The cards are stale. The backs are boring, and even if they are going for a ""traditional"" look, the cards just don't have a ""used"" feel like real traditional cards do. The packs that I did purchase had cards in them with ""production stains."" What I mean by that is the scraped look you get on certain cards, especially from the 80's and earlier. The sad thing is that I expect ""production stains"" on older cards, but not product made after 1990. Buy this set if you're hardcore or want every card of certain players. Other than that, I'd hold off."
4,Classic Southern African - Jazz,"If you don't know what South African Jazz is... then listen to this album and hear it definition. Soul-grabbing, moving, relaxing yet attention-getting. An unusual and comforting groove. And it's a live recording."
4,Shponglesque,"If you need a Shpongle fix while you rabbidly await the 3rd album from this amazing group later this year, then this should fit the bill.Also check out Flock of Bleeps by Younger Brother...another incarnation of Simon Posford of Shpongle fame. That album sounds more like the real thing, though more dance floor oriented.This album, while enjoyable, just can't quite capture that ""inexpressible"" element that makes Shpongle Shpongle. The remixers do a very good job of interpreting the music, sometime changing it almost beyond recognition, but I found myself enjoying the most the tracks that stayed closest to the orginal versions. Given repeat listens on a quality sound system in a dark room, Remixes does reward however.Bottom line: This is a good trance remix album, but it is not a true Shpongle album. But for now, it will do...."
2,Purists Will be Disappointed,"This disk, though it uses Shpongle material, isn't going to give you the Shpongle fix that other reviewers have suggested. I purchased this through iTunes to support iTunes carrying material I like and I already had all the other albums Shpongle had produced at the the time. I cannot recommend this album for anything more than a collection completer."
4,I Wish This Book Were Still in Print,"When I was 18 years old I spent a semester in England through a college study abroad program. This was the book that we used in our social studies class. When the class first began, I wasn't too knowledgeable (or even interested) in ""Europe's linguistic minorities."" However, by the end of the class, I felt as if I had a deeper connection with the Irish, Welsh, Scotts, and Manx, if only in regards to their preservation and use of language. Each group had similarities in the ways in which they went about defending their culture, as well as different approaches consistent with their customs.This book was out of print even in 1983, when I had my copy and accidentally left it in England. I really regret losing the book. I only got to read through it once. I would like to be able to read it in 1999 and see if the information still holds up years later."
4,The Passion tells how obsessions can rule one's life.,"The Passion is a tale that follows the life of Henri, a chicken-wringer in Napoleon's army. His passion for Napoleon causes him to live his life in the army, fighting a war that he sees no meaning in. The second part of the novel introduces Villanelle, a Venetian whose passion for gambling causes her to lose her heart to a married woman. Henri and Villanelle's lives eventually intertwine, and soon, Villanelle becomes Henri's unattainable passion. With her lush, rich writing, Jeanette Winterson weaves a powerful story of passion and magic on the background of late nineteenth century Europe."
5,Gorgeous Prose,"One of the best books I've ever read. It's a fantasticalnarrative set in the time of Napoleon, but it's not at allan historical novel. There are two narrators: Henri, adwarf working for Napoleon in the waning years of his European campaigns; and Villanelle, a young, sensual woman living and gambling (literally and figuratively) in Italy. Eventually, the two narrators' stories overlap and connect. Ms. Winterson's prose, especially in her descriptions of love and lovers, is breathtaking."
5,Awesome!,"This is a work for which this often overworked word is truly appropriate. The talent of this writer is indeed overwhelming. There were times when reading this book when I just stopped, in awe of the beauty and the incitefulness of some paragraph or sentence or even phrase. This was not easy to do as the narrative, an intertwining of the stories of the chicken cook for Napoleon and a beautiful Venetian born with webbed feet, is a thoroughly engaging tale. There are few works of contemporary literature that can compare to this novel in its ability to really convey the essential elements of passionate love. This was my first exposure to Ms. Winterson's work but certainly will not be my last. If you are in awe as I am of those who create artistic masterpieces using words as their medium then rush to read this book."
5,One of the most beautiful novels I have ever read!,"This novel is a work of art. The words are filled with poetry. It is a bittersweet love story that takes you to a whole other world. The story of Henri and Villanelle will touch you in many ways. There are many metaphors and foreshadows, which means that you'll have to pay close attention to the descriptions. I love the beautiful descriptions in the novel; they captured me.This is an incredible read; it blew me away! I highly recommend it."
4,Amazing Book,"I loved this book. The writing is like nothing I've ever read before. It happens to be dreamlike yet filled with philosophical ponderings at the same time. The story begins by telling the stories of two separate characters. Each character lives in a world that is beautifully realized by Winterson. She manages to express the magic found in everyday life, the good things and the bad things.The theme deals with love, and passion, and to what lengths people will go for love. In the universe of The Passion, a true test of courage is how much you can love. A really beautiful book with playful prose that can reawaken a passion for life.The two main characters weave magical stories, the soldier serving Napoleon, describes disgustingly Napoleon's love for chicken, and the girl of Venice, wanderer and adventurer through the city that changes.Each character is fascinating, yet together I do not think they have much chemistry, and their fate is not what I would have chosen."
4,THE PASSION,"One must admire the way that Winterson so easily spoke to the idea of love, or the lack there of, between the characters of Henri, Bonaparte, and Villanille. It speaks to the complexities of love with such honesty and truth that you couldn't help but become involved with her story.Speaking about love isn't an easy topic to open up to. How do you even begin? She speaks on such a poetic level that you hang onto every word she writes. You listen to the emotion and connect to it so involuntarily that it says something about what a phenomenal artist, and author Mrs. Winterson is."" My passion for her, even though she could never return it, showed me the difference between inventing a lover and falling in love.The one is about you, the other about someone else""Such honesty and truth goes unparalelled, that if there are any readers out there who love truth and beautiful command of language, I highly recommend this novel."
5,Dynamite's explosive changes to the world,"The age of explosives, which heralded the more sophisticated warfare choices of modern times, began in the mid-1800s with the inventions of one Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, whose discovery of dynamite made possible industrial changes and explosives. A MOST DAMNABLE INVENTION: DYNAMITE, NITRATES, AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD surveys the many changes the discovery of dynamite brought to the world; from the environmental damage it caused to the wealth it brought to its inventor, whose remorseful conscience led him to leave his estate to the establishment of the prizes which bear his name today. Nitrates were next on the list of discoveries, fostered by German scientist Fritz Haber whose breakthrough prolonged the First World War and helped triple the population of the world. No understanding of warfare or civilization's advancement would be complete without A MOST DAMNABLE INVENTION: DYNAMITE, NITRATES, AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD in hand."
1,Hayward Super II,"Purchased this item brand new. Installed the pump only to find there is a crack in the strainer cover. Due to the crack in the cover pump does not function properly. Amazon was out of stock so I tried on 3 occasions to get a replacement from Hayward. Hayward has been no help. Would definitely NOT recommend Hayward. Poor customer service, poor quality control! Next time I'll choose another manufacturer."
4,Comfortable boots.,"These are not the most stylish boots around, but they do look good with a pair of jeans. They're very comfortable. I've worn them all day without any problems. I'm only giving them four instead of five stars because for Clarks, they're rather plain. Still, I got them for under $30 and they fit well."
3,Heal wore away to a hole,"I got these from another site, i loved them, to bad the heal wore down so fast, i'd say 1.5-2 months and a had a gaping hole in the leather. To bad as they are great looking boots and nice quality. I would NOT recommend because of this!"
3,Not very comfortable,"I am usually not very picky about shoes, but this pair I bought is just not that great. The size runs a little bigger, especially around the ankle and it hurts! I mean the side just keep rubbing my ankle and it hurts! The shoes are a little too big for me, but it hurts on the top (close to the toe area) as well. Overall, not very well made.3-27-2008 update: after wearing this pair of shoes for several weeks, the leather softened and I like it a lot better now. I would give it 4 star now. :)"
4,thoroughly entertaining,"Very entertaining view into Dali's personal life. A highlight is the Afterward, which reflects on Carlos himself. This moment is especially powerful once you have heard his story."
1,Not impressed with this book,"I didn't end up finishing this book. I really didn't know anything about Salvadore Dali so I wasn't reading this as a fan. He came across like a pervert, a bore and someone who was full of himself. He seemed to get off on hurting others. I just didn't enjoy it so after a few chapters I just deleted it."
1,dense monograph,Sadly the authors have opted for a levelof abstraction that obscures many of thebeautiful details. Particularly disappointingis the last chapter on matrix theory which veersoff into an odd mixture of marginalia which havealmost no applications.
3,**Inferior Quality** Compared to Many Fiskars Products,"My experience with Fiskars model 9275 Bypass Pruner is that they are of sub-par quality compared to other Fiskars products I own. The cutting blade was thin and wore down quickly. The metal parts had a dark tarnish, almost rust, after only one season despite regular care. That said, the price I paid was almost half of my other Fiskars bypass pruners.My other Fiskars pruner [Fiskars 7936 PowerGear Pruner] have held up very well for five years and are still going strong. The cutting blade is substantial and I sharpen it regularly.I have a friend who buys all new gardening tools each season. She and I have different budgets. But, even if I had her budget, I personally would rather pay a bit more for tools that will endure if I maintain them.So if you would like to go with the Fiskars brand of pruners, I suggest you consider some of Fiskars' other models especially if you prefer tools that last."
5,Pro grade,I purchased these pruners because they looked like they were constructed/designed well... and I was right!! they are very ruggedly constructed and work perfectly. I definitely would purchase them again...
2,The latch is an issue!,"The latch falls back into place often while cutting--causing you to have to reopen them before making another cut. Annoying! Maybe mine are defective?Other than that, they are made very well and seem very sturdy."
3,+ 1/2 stars...World Music from Guitarist Larry Coryell,"Two years before the release of Paul Simon's GRACELAND and the accompanying increase in awareness of world music, Larry Coryell travelled to Brazil and created this low-key recording in Brazil, which features many native performers--including vocalist Dori Caymmi who is featured on several cuts. Coryell is backed by a 9-piece band, including drummer Billy Cobham (who worked with Miles Davis and John McLaughlin) and saxophonist Donald Harrison, who should have gotten co-billing on this CD in that he has has many solos as Coryell himself. Overall, this is a fairly laid back affair. Coryell does a nice job of blending the local musical influences, but except for the 9-minute ""Vera Cruz"" that closes the album, the music seldon catches fire. Instead, it too often becomes little more than pleasant mood music."
4,A lovely book,"This really is a beautiful book, and I believe if it had been published 20 years ago it would have been a huge seller in the fantasy market. I think the reason some of the other reviewers have not enjoyed the work as much is because this sort of fantasy kingdom has been portrayed before--Never Never Land, Middle Earth, Narnia--even the world of The Last Unicorn itself. Still, at the end, I found myself yearning for Beagle's mythical kingdom. And Abuelita is a wonderful character. A slower, older style, but worth finishing."
2,Just could not get into this book,"I usually love Beagle, but nothing in the book caught my attention. Beagle's typically poetic writing style was absent from this work. An absense felt all the more because Unicorn Sonata was cursed with a bad plot. Not that the concept was bad, it just moved too slow. In fact, the plot often came to a complete halt. Perhaps, this is because this book seems to have been written with a younger audience in mind than most of Beagle's books (I would say ages 8 and up). I just felt this book was missing the magic his books usually possess, or perhaps I am too old for the magic in this book."
4,Sexy comedy,"I originally saw this movie broadcasted on Univision (Ch. 34 in L.A.) and like it because of it has goofy/funny/sassy situations, and allowed the attractive women in it to show off. I love the voluptuous built of mexican women and this movie does not disappoint. I bought this movies because I especially like Diana Herrera, and i was hoping to pick up the nude scene that the broadcast version had pixelated. However, this DVD version has been edited and the portion of the scene that had the pixelation was deleted. I am still happy with the rest of the movie since it is a major improvement over the broadcasted version that I had recorded in VHS, but I don't understand why that one scene was removed from the DVD. I will now have to assumed that all other DVD titles associated with UniCine were also edited and probably not worth buying."
2,NO turn knob. Not as stated in listing.,Lock is not as stated in listing. It is key on both sides. It does NOT have a knob on either side. Key access only both sides. I was very unhappy about this.
4,My son loved the these!!,"My son was a toy story fanatic. He no longer wears these, or any pull ups at all, but if he did, these would be the ones I would still be buying. The only thing is that he is a real slender kid, and so the 2t would fit him better, but wouldn't hold as much as the 4 t."
3,Preferable to regular diapers,"These helped get my kids used to taking their own diaper on and off, which helps with potty training. My main complain is how easily they come apart and how hard they are to get back together. Taking them apart is necessary to change #2's, but you don't need to put them together again after that."
3,"Rip easily, so-so containment","My son is in the stage where he poops only in these. They are cut high on the thigh, and often don't contain everything, so it ends up in the sheets. Gross.The other problem is that the side tabs rip extremely easily as you are trying to get them on. We've had several rip this way.I tried pampers easy ups, and they are far better on both counts. They are cut lower, thus providing better containment, and the sides don't rip, I don't have to worry about it as we are getting them on and off. They are also softer and a little more cloth like - better all around."
3,Dog never really liked it,"My dog was never that interested in this toy. She would rather chase around a ping-pong ball. We never had issues with durability but again, our dog didn't play with the toy that often."
5,Enjoyable,"Pleasant to listen to the voice of Ram Dass...... amusing, uplifting and at times moving. Everyone should hear this amazing story teller and philosopher. What an exceptional person and friend to the fortunate ones that have crossed paths with him. God is smiling down on him."
2,Better off buying casters at home depot,"Don't bother with these. Can't turn (see other review) and no shoulder (see other review). Plus these wheels are like a weird plastic that leaves marks on my epoxy floor. For 40 bucks, no way"
5,Very responsive seller,Products are fine and seller responded quickly when the items didn't arrive as scheduled
5,"Well documented, clear, and fair",This book has 57 pages of references and citations.This book also has a 39 page section with the Atkins Corporation's side of the story and Dr. Greger's rebuttal to their counter arguments.This book is easy to read and well documented.The author also has made his research on low carb diets available at:http://atkinsexposed.org/
2,Low Carb / High protein is definitely THE way to go to Reduce Cardiometabolic disease,"America has an ongoing epidemic of obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Low carb is definitely THE way to go to reduce the insulin resistance that is causing this epidemic.see [...] by Peter Attia MD and ""Why We Get Fat"" and ""Good Calories / Bad Calories "" by Gary Taubes[...] for all the facts. SOME may lower cardiometabolic risk factors through the nutritional advice offered by this ""anti-carbophobia"" advice offered by Dr Greger, but for the insulin resistant majority of Americans at risk, low-carb IS THE way to go.Gregory S Pokrywka MD FACP FNLA NCMPPrevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Women's Menopausal HealthAssistant Professor of MedicineJohns Hopkins University School of MedicineDiplomate American Board Clinical Lipidology and Fellow, National Lipid Assn.Certified Menopause Practitioner: North American Menopause SocietyDirector: Baltimore Lipid Center. Board Member, South East Lipid Assn."
5,Learning Math by folding paper,"My son and I are using this book for homes school. We are about half-way through it. The book is filled with paper models of a mathematical nature to cut out, fold and glue. Jacob is 11 and can do almost all of the work himself. The models are a lot more interesting than you would think, although I don't know enough math to understand all the mathematics involved. There are twelve different models. I should make it clear that the book is disposable. I recommend this book as a fun project for a family to do together, or a good source of independent projects for kids."
5,A great way to quickly polish your Spanish,"This book provides an excellent crash course in all of the grammar and conversation stuff you probably missed in your first two years of Spanish. It takes a systematic cruise through verbs, adjectives, prepositions, and tenses -- admittedly dense stuff, but in a very accessible way. Each chapter also provides a list of commonly-used phrases and some common mistakes made by ""gueros.""I would recommend this book to anyone with a moderate grasp of Spanish who wants to avoid sounding like a tourist."
2,Not up to expectations,"The book took about a month to get to me even though it should have been a week. Also, there was a large coffee stain in the book, but the description said it was in very good condition. It is perfectly functional, though, so it serves its purpose."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I saw a similar toy at a friends house and thought it would be perfect for my beagles. They loved the toy right off the bat, chasing it and playing with it. Within 15 minutes, one of them had chewed a piece completely off. I was really disappointed because they loved it so much but because they could chew it to pieces so easily I had to take it away so they wouldn't choke. Total waste of money."
3,My dog isn't that bright,I bought this toy for my dog since he loves to take his toys away from everyone and chew on them. He got this ball on Christmas morning and he doesn't know what to do with it.
5,Buy a Lot,We always buy several of these at one time because our dog loves them so much. We love them too because it keeps our high-maintenance terrier busy for awhile.
4,IF YOU DON'T GET THAT CD...,"...YOU'RE NO GOOD, YOU'RE NO GOOD BABE, BABE YOU'RE NO GOOD..SMILE NOW, DIE LATER-FROST RULZ MOFOKAZZZZZZZZZZZ..GREECE THE LAND OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT SUPPORTS..BIG UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,You will not pass the exam,"This software or book will help you to get familiar with the windows2000 utilities windows , if you didn't see them before ,it will help you as step by step reference to complete all the basic tasks, However it's too far from the real 70-215 Exam you will not pass the exam depending in this material you have to find more in-depth material. Good luck"
2,sad item bad business,First it's not two disk it's one double sided disk and movie is scratched so the movie skips. I got what I paid for.
5,A true classic,"This movie says a lot about the talents of Al Pacino and Sean Penn. It's a movie with a great blend of things: crime drama, love story, and a realistic view on life. There's no played out ""good guy rides off into the sunset"" ending. In reality, criminals end up either in prison or murdered. We label them as outcasts, but they're really people just like us, emotions and all. This movie highlights that. A must see if you haven't yet.For the crime movie enthusiast, it's a must see movie as well. If you're the type who's seen all the Godfather movies, Goodfellas, Scarface, etc, then you need to check out this one. A guaranteed classic."
5,ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,"This film just gets better every time I watch it. What the helldoes Sean Penn have to do to get an Oscar??? Pacino is masterful asalways, but Penn steals the show in this one. He is almost unrecognisable as the wimpy, disloyal lawyer Klienfeld. Why was the ending shown at the beginning though? Sometimes it can work, but in this one it takes something away from the viewer. Do not miss this one, so many have and it's their loss."
5,Great Acting,"I'm slowly but surely going through every movie Al Pacino has ever been in. I've seen most of them at least once on TCM or AMC and now I'm getting the DVD's.Not even close to my favorite Al Pacino movie, but it's still well above the typical run of the mill movie that doesn't have Al Pacino in it. He's a great actor and knows how to pick his parts."
3,"Descent movie, not a must see.","I found this movie to be dull during parts. I love Pacino, and I'm a Puerto Rican, but this movie really didn't do much for me. I loved the character ""pachanga"" and the hyperactive, coked up Sean penn was excellent in this film. But Pacino, was very low key. (except for the infamous ""here comes the pain"") And Penelope Ann Miller was EXTREMELY dull, she brought the movie down. The ending is not a cliched at least. And Pacinos slow, droning voice in the narration is excellent."
3,I miss the '70's,"""Carlito's Way"" has THE best party scene I've ever seen in a movie (Sean Penn's oceanfront residence)."
5,"It was a great movie, great plot with lots of suspense!","In this wonderful masterpiece, Carlito Brigante (Pacino) gets out of a 30-year sentence from his cocaine addicted lawyer Kleinfeld (Penn). He vows to go straight but no one really buys it. He meets his one time love, and vows to her to go legit. But then his lawyer has a favor... I can't say no more from there, the suspense is to great! Penn was great, but Pacino was the bonus. Another great DePalma film. If you haven't watched Carlito's Way, rent it!!!"
3,Carlito's Way,"This film is good, but not as good as Scarface. And what's with this ""Carlito's Way (Collector's Edition)"" DVD? Can't Universal make up their mind's? Hey, why not re-release this film on full screen format? Now their's an idea."
2,"Pacino is great, as usual.","Pacino, as usual, does good work. His stint as a Puerto Rican is great,though he doesn't have a way with accents. The opening scene is inspired...good stuff. Great personality development. Excellent plot and devices...typical racketeering gangsta flick stuff. The only thing I really disliked about the movie...but was a big part was the romantic element. I thought Penelope Ann Miller was a bore. They could have written out her character and the film would have been all the better for it. Sean Penn's acting was really good considering I was feeling pure disgust for him during the entire movie. Of course, I think his makeup and hair had a lot to do with this. Save your money on this one. Buy Godfathers or Dog Day Afternoon, or Glengarry Glen Ross or Scarface instead."
3,Big Eyes Movie!!,"I ate this movie for breakfast twice!! The men were very exciting, especially the John McEnroe who played a good lawyer!! I was scared and not sure about what was happening many times (warns: There is some dying in the first beginning and at the last part), but lucky for Al Parchino to be there!! He made me feel safe during the movie even though he was wearing a leather jacket (like the Fonz)!!! I was confused by him also because his eyes were looking like the owl from the cartoon - wide and scaring!! Also, he talks like no man on the earth, and made me wonder if his Cardlito was maybe from another planet. I think, if you are o.k. with the trickyness, that the learning of the story is that CardLeto is really from another planet, and just wants to get home with the girl. For that he should win many statues - being the big-looking alien with the language is not easy!!! I hold back only two stars because there was no spaceship near the end when he was talking in space - too bad!!!!"
3,Ok movie,"The scene in the begining is great. ""Ok Im reloaded!"". But there are just WAY TO MANY corny love scenes with bad music. Basically its all narrated by Carlito, he tells the story. Its a good movie but its just too drawn out and VERY boring most of the time. The movie is 143 minutes long. I would of cut alot of the scenes out. If your a Sean Penn fan, the Crime Drama ""State of Grace"" blows this movie away, there is NO comparison. Im a HUGE Al Pacino fan and yes his acting is superior in this or any of his films but as I said before it's just alot of boring scenes. (Yawn)."
2,so-so film,sean penn is the real star of the film.re-making scarface isn't gonna happening again so fougetaboutit and get over it.this is slap stick film making.not very original.
1,Previews ruin it!,"Great movie, F***ing terrible DVD. I didn't pay for previews, I paid for the movie. Absolutely ridiculous!"
5,scarface with a twist,"When the guys that brought you Scarface team up again what badthings can happen.Brian De Palma and Al Pacino two of the biggeststars on their film duties in Hollywood today.This movie reallyhas the 80's,disco feel scarface as but as the De Palma plot turnand twists seen in Snake Eyes,Body Double,and Raising Cain so it's all very entertaining.Along with another De Palma regular SeanPenn(Casualties Of War) plays the coke addicted wacko lawyer toabsolute perfection.This film not as violent as Scarface as moreplot twists which makes it almost more entertaining with a greatcast including John Leguizamo and Penelope Ann Miller Carlito'sWay is one of Pacino's,Penn's,and De Palma's best films ever soif you like a mixture of The Usual Suspects and Scarface giveCarlito's Way a watch it's great."
3,pretty good gangster melodrama,"The thing that saves this film is the acting: Pacino is a totally convincing criminal who wants to start over, yet faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles to his dream; Penn is amazing as a sleazy coke-head lawyer, who wants to be a ""player"". Both of these fine actors act with their whole bodies, exuding their life trajectory with every gesture and expression. Indeed, it may be one of Pacino's best performances. Nonetheless, like Scarface (which I thought was a ridiculous caricature, almost cartoon brutality), Carlito seems to walk into violent situations as easily as ordering a latte at Starbuck's. Either the guy has a run of really bad luck, or it is a marvel that there are any punks left in NYC. Then there is the beautiful true love, who returns to him in spite of his spate in prison, pregnant and about to leave with him, until...well, you can guess the formula.This is not a bad film, but with some more imagination it could have been far far better, in my opinion."
4,Pacino and DePalma Do It Again,Pacino is the man. It's that simple. The scene on the escalator is the best of the movie. Pacino dies in 90% of all his films.
5,What a movie!!!,"This is Al Pacino's greatest film. Als greatest roles have always been on a street level, with the people. As a former puerto-rican drug lord trying to escape his past life of crime and violence, this film captures all the beauty, character and extraordinary acting ability of Al pacino. It is Al at his best. Scarface, the Godfather and Serpico were great films as well but anyone who is a true fan of Al Pacino knows that he deserved an Oscar for his performance in this film. I would strongly urge anyone who is an Al Pacino fan and otherwise to purchase this movie. You wont regret it."
4,The great lost gangster movie,"A character driven piece on trust and loyalty with some explosive DePalma action, this is a real emotional ride, thanks to Pacinos tour de force lead performance. Unlike some of his other characters, you really care about this guy and his need to go straight. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sean Penn exceeds at making his lawyer a repulsive whiny slug. Just sit back and watch these pros work a great story. Anyone who loved the Godfather or the Untouchables will love this, too. The DVD offers a great widescreen picture plus a trailer, but nothing else. The movie speaks for itself, though. I also love how it doesn't milk its 70's time setting. It's totally natural and real."
1,Worst Movie I have ever seen,"I don't know what is wrong with you people. This is the worst Brian DePalma film, Al Pacino's worst film, and quite frankly the worst movie I have ever seen. When they played ""You are so Beautiful,"" there was literally cheese dripping off the reel. The plot is contrived, there is no character development and the acting, not to mention the writing and directing is awful. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE>"
1,What is so Wonderful about this movie?,"This is not that great of a movie. I dont know why people are making such a big deal out of this movie. I saw it, I tryed to understand it, I just thought it wasnt one of Pacino's best....sorry"
3,Lightweight,"A bit cheesy, too lightweight. Bent in first usage; one broke in second usage. Not worth the packing and postage to send them back."
5,"A ""Fine"" purchase.","I purchased this book during my internship, when I felt constantly overwhelmed by the large textbooks we were told were the staples of internship.It seems like a great, portable review of all of the topics which interns in Internal Medicine see on a day-to-day basison the wards.The fine editing adds enough detail to be comprehensive, but still concise enough to be read quickly when you're busy.I recommend it highly."
2,"good, but needs more indexing","I was hoping for more indexing or grouping together of certain topics. Some of his suggestions work, and some are mildly effective, like anything else you think you can cook up in your kitchen for cleaning.I am glad I did not donate to PBS for this."
2,Not that helpful.,"This book looked very promising when I saw a few tips on some PBS telethon, but the handful of messes I wanted to clean, his book could not help with, or helped by suggesting ammonia. That's hardly the greenest solution, but it was his only answer to several of my questions. I will look into the 'How Clean is Your House?"" book because they barely use such harsh, stinky chemicals."
4,Haley's Cleaning Hints,Nice book. Had been looking for it since watching it on WTTW11. Price of the book is a little high considering the quality of paper. But any case the book itself is very helpful and i would recommend for reading.
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"The book is difficult to follow, poorly organized, and severely lacking in useful information."
5,Terrific Cleaning Tips !,"Terrific household cleaning hints ! Every hint I've tried so far has produced much better & quicker results than the more expensive storebought cleaning products.First purchased ""Haley's Hints"", also good reading. This time bought 3 copies of ""Haley's Cleaning Hints"", two will be gifts for daughter and a friend."
1,"Don't buy this...buy his ""Haley's Hints""","Having seen him on PBS, I bought both. ""Haley's Hints"" has all that his ""Cleaning Hints' has and more."
3,lots of ideas but not well written,I like the fact that the book has lots of ways to clean but it lacks detail. It's as if the person knew what they wanted to say but couldn't get it down on paper. I don't think that the writer would have ever passed any of my college English classes.
2,Waste of money...,"I bought this because I saw Grahm Haley on my local PBS station. He seemed great but I was so diappointed with this book. The book is awful, difficult to follow, difficult to find solutions for what your looking for. Make a donation to PBS instead and get his videos."
5,It's a must have in your home.....,"Haley's Cleaning Hints is a must-have in your home. I have both of his books and refer to them often. It's a go-to book that you shouldn't be without. There are so many helpful hints on what to do when getting out a stain using just what you would commonly already have around the house, ie. baking soda, vinegar, etc."
5,"Quick read, informative, and entertaining","Haley must have had a lot of time on his hands, but thank goodness for that. He's like the MacGyver of household cleaning. Who knew to save the baking soda for the drain. Works like a charm with a little vinegar. Also works great to mop up grease off the surface. No more blockages for me.Thanks Haley"
5,Best instrumental rock album EVER!,"Quite simply, this is the best instrumental album of classical/progressive rock ever released. ""Lament"" is gorgeous, sad & chilling, ""Opening Move"" & ""Second Spasm"" are playful & Xciting, only ""Checkmate"" lets up at all & it's still well above average. Why these guys didn't become world famous back in 1974 I don't know, but this album will change your life! Get it!"
2,not enough info,"I tried to find out size information before hand - but all I found was what is printed on the packaging. Turns out the 'small' raincoat is too small for my little dog and the design of this coat means that there is not much room for size differences. It also seems like difficult to put on (even if it had fit him) as there is no velcro for quick dressing/undressing - only very small holes you have to stick his little legs through. These are probably great for keeping the thing on him, but he has to agree to get into it in the first place. For these 2 reasons, I've given it only 2 stars."
4,good little watch,I work in a lab that doesn't have clocks on the walls so I ordered this with the intention of using it in the lab. the only problem I have with this watch is that the face is so small. my fault though for misinterpreting the size.
4,Nice watch,This is a decent watch for the price. It is small which is what I wanted and I can adjust the band as I wear it. The color is also good and will just about go with any thing and will be great for any occasion. I have not worn the watch as yet but I am getting ready to do so. I hope that it will last me for a little time.
5,Nice Watch,"Has a very good look and high quality. When work looks very nice, highly liked by friends and given as gifts. The black look is fantastic!"
4,Nice watch for a good price,"I ordered this watch and it arrived on time but didn't work. I went through the return process and got a replacement that worked. Amazon refunded the cost of shipping to send the defective watch back. I noticed some other reviews that said the watch arrived not working. So far, the second watch has been great. Fair price for a nice watch!"
5,LOVE this watch!,"I got this model watch as a gift in 1994- I wanted a simple black beat-me-up watch, but this one was a surprise: It's not advertised as water-resistant, or water proof for that matter, but I wore it scuba diving (I forgot I had it on). When I surfaced and realized it, I got bummed because it was behind--but it was STILL RUNNING. Then I realized that it was behind only for as long as I was deeper than a certain depth. Low and behold, I moved up the time, and it never so much as fogged, then or after that. I've bought a few others of this model since then, and have loved them all. Can't beat 'em for the price."
1,Out of Mana,"Ordered one of these watches, arrived not functioning. Sent for a replacement, and the replacement was also not functional. Amazon says the batch may have been defective, so be careful about this watch until they replace their inventory."
2,Smaller than expected,"Much smaller than portrayed in picture, wrist band is very short and band seems fragile. I have a small wrist and watch band just fits."
2,"Beautiful cover, at least","I bought the 1961 Berkley paperback for its lovely red/purple cover. The novel, which is short by today's standards, 128 pages, is weak. The plot consists of an interesting trip through space to meet some interesting aliens, but also some boring diplomacy which Blish tries to make more interesting by piling on lots of silly melodramatic moments, including what amounts to a courtroom scene in which the star witness climbs out of his sickbed to provide crucial testimony. Worst of all the first half of the book consists of stereotypical cardboard characters sitting around yakking away.You might like this if you are interested in pacifistic SF in which aliens have to keep us violent humans in line, or were wondering about James Blish's theories on education, popular music and censorship, but otherwise I have to advise that you steer clear."
2,One of James Blish's few none Star Trek novels.,"If you are a fan of the novelizations of Star Trek episodes done by James Blish, then this is a novel you will want to eventually get.The Star Dwellers is a simple story of earthlings and alien ""angels"". It is a storyline that has been done better since this novel. But it will help you determine whether you like Blish's writing because it is Star Trek or not."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED!,"It's supposed to come with Media Center 2005, but actually comes with Media Center 2002! I know of 2 such cases: there is a sticker on the laptop that says Media Center 2005, but if you look at the system properties, it's Media Center 2002! What a scam, Toshiba! And very disappointing. :("
3,Several methods are shown for taping a joint/muscle.,"Unique to this book were the several alternative methods shown to tape a single joint/muscle. The artist schetches used to show the correct method of taping were not as nice as the photos in Perrin's book, but they did convey the needed information."
5,"Complex, humorous and heartbreaking","This book is the kind that exposes nerve endings you'd forgotten existed, emotionally and intellectually. Glatt's writing is so rich and complex and engaging it inspires nothing short of awe. Really, a tremendous accomplishment. Highly recommended."
3,So much pain,"This is a book that shows how vulnerable these women are who are in pain from the past, present or future. Their sexuality is used as a cessation of the pain and an understanding of their places in life. The men they encounter are a means to an unachievable end. Sex is not the point of these encounters for the women - they are not promiscuous, but in pain. Perhaps this is universaly true and certainly worth examination. Rachel is a very moving character - she has the intelligence to know how self-destructive her behavior is and yet she is not capable of stopping it since it brings a fleeting anesthetic to the pain she endures when she anticipates her mother's death. Her mother's belief in breast reconstruction is very moving and indicative of her strength in the face of adversity. I am impressed by the way these characters are woven into the story line, and I found myself caring about all of them. I look forward to reading more books by Lisa Glatt."
4,engaging & thought-provoking,"It took me a few chapters to get into this book, but as I kept pressing through and I ended up not being able to put it down.I really enjoyed the chapters with the other characters and see their interaction w/the main character, Rachel.It was so devastating when Rachel's mother passed but at the same time it was enlightening to see how women - of all ages - interact with themselves, with their girlfriends, with boys/men and how they view themselves.Lisa, THUMBS UP!!!!"
3,A Girl Becomes a Mediocore Book...,"I have to admit I was disappointed with this book. I was drawn in by what the story had to offer but it just didn't come through in the end. There were so many possibilities with the female characters in this book -- unfortunately, they each were developed enough to be intriguing but then the development, and storylines, stopped. Not a bad read, but not a memorable one either."
3,This book isn't fluff and will never be printed with a pink cover,"I had a bit of trouble getting into this book, mostly because the narrator Rachel wasn't resonating with me, and I see that other reviewers had similar experiences. I think the one who termed this ""dark chick lit"" is dead on--these are all themes and events females experience, and they can't be presented with a bright pink cover like most other chick lit. While living with her terminally ill mother, Rachel has to confront her own personal relationships, her self-image, unwanted pregnancy, and more. This is a heavy dose of reality, and Glatt presents the complications of Rachel's life well."
2,What happened to the rest of the story?,"At first I found this book very absorbing. There are 3 stories going on that somehow tied into eachother. And maybe I missed something but the book only finished for one of these stories. And the book just ended. I was left hanging. It seemed as though the author just didn't want to continue on with the book, found a quick ending, and then was done with it. I was very disappointed!"
4,A Beautiful Novel About Being a Woman,"Lisa Glatt's novel, A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That is a wonderfully written novel concerned with essentially what it is to be female in contemporary American society. Rachel, the protagonist, is dealing with relationship failures and successes, her mother's bouts with breast cancer, abortion, birth control, friendship, weight gain and many other issues women confront. The novel will make you think about all of these issues, but it will also make you laugh and make you smile. Rachel is not a perfect protagonist. She'll annoy you sometimes with the choices she makes, but in the end that is what makes this book so compellingly readable: Rachel's humanity. Enjoy."
2,"Weak, with a glimmer of promise","Several of the reviews I have read here hit the nail right on the head: the women in this book verge on pathetic, their lives revolving around (the often anonymous) men they throw themselves at. I found parts of this book very good (and accurate, having had a similar experience) - when the main character deals with her mother's cancer. Sadly, much of this was lost in the fluff. If that fluff could be removed, this would be a much better book. I'm not a fan of the whole ""chick lit"" thing that followed the success of Bridget Jones, and this just confirmed my loathing. Modern young women can enjoy a deep, meaningful and complex read - it doesn't have to be all about men and shopping."
1,"nasty, brutish, and short","This book features 4 women who have no control over their own sexuality, and no interest in getting a greater understanding of it. Their impulses just come over them in waves, and they simply get beaten. ""Beautiful"", some would say, but it mostly made me angry. This book shows so little understanding, and the characters in it are so weak, that reads like a book a man had written about women. (Though, it also reminded me somehwat of Anais Nin autobiography - self-absorbed, self-searching, without being self-aware.) The only character that seems the slightest bit realistic is Georgia, the teenager, whose flatness and overractions can perhaps be attributed to adolesence."
3,francis bacon is back from the grave,"i love that francis bacon is credited in the title above as 'illustrator"" in dennis farr's little retrospective. bacon who sought to avoid illustration in his paintings by creating a reality, often relying somewhat on chance, that if inaccurate was in his mind 'greater' than the truth. this taken from a very moving quote from van gogh, whose letters and paintings francis studied closely. the reverse landscape in question is in fact reversed - its like an error card. otherwise the text is intelligent and the body of work is well chosen but there are so many bacon paintings its hard to find a comprehensive publication."
5,Fantastic new album,"This is the third Unseen album I've bought and I haven't been disappointed yet. I downloaded this a month ago and have been listening to it almost everyday since. I bought it yesterday when it came out. This album seems a little more polished than the other two I have, Explode and The Anger And The Truth. The only bad thing about about this CD, as with all punk CDs I've listened to, is that it is very short (I put all three albums on one 80-minute disc without having to overburn). Their version of Paint It Black, originally by the Rolling Stones, is my favorite track on the disc. This is definitely an album to get you pumped."
1,nope,"You are all idiots, Explode was a terrible cookie cutter punk album. That is when they started to suck and they still are sucking. If you wanna hear one of the few good punk bands still around check out global threat, as for the unseen, they are just as bland and terrible as the casualties are now."
5,Extension of fun and expansion of characters,The third book in the series that adds to the characters of the Elm Creek Quilter's story. It draws one into the group of quilters as their personal stories are expanded. This book leaves you wanting to know more about your new friends!
4,Out of the Woods,"Like the entire Elm Creek series, this book was captivating. It was an easy read, but not without some suspense. I love her work, going back to 'The Bean Tree's"" and beyond."
4,"Charming, gentle novel with women you won't forget","I very much enjoyed this book. It was a quiet, gentle novel that didn't require too much thought--you just cuddle up and enjoy the ride. Yes, it is easy to predict the outcome of each individual story, but the pleaure of this book is watching the friendship between the women grow and develop, and watch how each women continues to care deeply for each of her friends while dealing with her own problems. It is a testament to true friendship, and the bonds that women can form across miles, race, and age. A perfect book to snuggle up with on a blustery afternoon. I can't wait for more from Chiaverini!"
3,Cross-Country quilters,It was ok not wonderful but ok condition -- wonderful read-- makes me want to find a quilting camp & go there & make new quilting friends & finish some projects
4,Good read,"I am more of a knitter than a quilter. However, I find these books to be entertaining. I picked up the first book on the sale rack in a store, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed reading the stories. I plan on continuing reading more. They are a good read and keep me wanting to read more."
5,Great read for a rainy day,"This is my favorite Jennifer Chiaverini book. Great story, and a pleasure to sit down and enjoy on a rainy day - with a quilt, of course!!"
3,Defective Book,"The Elm Creek Quilt stories are wonderful. However, the publisher - Penguin Publishing did not do it justice by releasing defective books. The book that was shipped to me had 2 chapters repeated and the end was omitted completely. Because it was some time before I got to reading it and discovered the problem my ""time"" had expired for returns. Amazon does not make it easy for customers to contact them nor do they return inquiring emails. I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future. It's all about the customer service!"
4,WAR,"A delightful romp this is. The grenade incident is a lot of fun...until the end of the scene. I love the sentence that ends that chapter. I found out after I read this book that my cousin's wife is a descendent of Pyle's. Bless you, Old Jarhead!"
2,A little too much,"This books starts out with lots of excellent information on Islam and various problems that Muslims in this country go through. An excellent easy reading for a new Mulsim convert such as myself.However the second half of the book gets into topics such as racism, black history, ideals of Malcom X and Louis Farrakhan and the idea of white people being the devil. The author does't present these topics as something members of the Nation of Islam would have to put up with since these ideas are all not of the Quran. Rather the author provides way too much history and various ideals of Malcom X and Louis Farrakhan and in my opinion went way too far on this topic and it made the book an overall negative for me."
4,A few things you should know about 'Fjelltronen',"The adjectives Satyr uses to decribe this album in the liner notes are 'dreaming', 'tragic', 'misanthropic', 'beautiful' and 'uplifting'. I don't really think a review can do better than those adjectives, and despite what shallow souls would see as contradiction (""tragic AND uplifting"") they convey the essence of the music perfectly. 'Fjelltronen' exists in a deeper realm the shallow will never comprehend.Worth purchasing for the epic first piece alone ('Det var en gang et menneske'), this is indeed pure northern atmosphere music, perfectly complemented by the Kittelsen art which accompanies it."
3,This book is helpful to non-restaurant people only.,"Although there was much information in the book, much of it was for a complete restaurant novice. I would hope that someone with that little experience would not go into the restaurant business. The book was good for a ""once-over"" look, but I don't know if I will be keeping it. A little disappointing."
1,Academic Exercise,"A more apt title would be ""The Theory Of Running A Bar."" It is and looks like a book written by an academic who has never actually run a bar, but knows the theory of how one should be run. There are endless lists of things that might happen or you might consider, but very few concrete suggestions of what you should do.A major disappointment."
2,Very Dissapointed with this book,I could not finish this book. In part one I kept reading about daughters being molested by their fathers and step-fathers -- it was too much.
4,Adult Children of Abusive Parents,This book made me feel the pain of those who have suffered at the hands of abusive parents. It proved to be useful for my course project.
2,"Starts out great, then doesn't measure up.","I found that this book, although promising a fresh look at the age old problems of adult children of abuse, falls short in the long run. Adults who experienced abuse as children are usually well aware of that abuse. This book deals with uncovering the abuse, and then takes, in my opinion, controversial steps at therapy. Those steps include a ""reconstruction of the past"" in essence fabricating lies and letting those lies replace the truths of the abuse. I, for one, was looking for a way to defeat the anger I feel, not reconstruct my past into some idyllic existence. For me, living a lie where I remember parents who never existed would only be compounding the problem.So, I cannot recommend this book as part of an affective regimen of therapy."
1,Too much self-advertising,"I've enjoyed Graden's previous books much more. There is not much new information in this book, and the book contains too much advertising of his own companies and his former student's companies. It seems that the whole purpose of the book is to make you a customer of his company. Not worth buying."
2,FRENCH LOTION,"I GOT THE LOTION TODAY, SMELL SO GOOD BUT GOES AWAY INMEDIATLE, WHAT A HEK I DICIDE TO KEEP IT TO MUCH TROUBLE TO RETURN IT.IT WONT LAST TO LONG"
1,Very disappointing X-Com entry,"Microprose screws this with a 3-D first person shooting X-Com game where its original is made known for in a rich strategic-operational and tactical combat game. I never made a good shooting with the current engine while just firing blindly and the UFO floats in front of you while attacking you from 360 degree. It is a bad experience and what's more unfortunately, you can't turn off the shooting part or make it automatic. Save your money. This is a pass."
4,Join the Herd!,"I first bought Positive Friction as an Amazon recommendation. After a first listen, I decided it was a mistake and it went to the basement of my ipod. For some reason, I had an urge months later to pull it back up . . . and fell in love with it--every song on it. They have a folkie-country-rock sound that is difficult to plug into a specific category. Life's a Ride is my second and I warmed up to it immediately. Some excellent strong songs on it with the strong vocals, excellent lyics, and rhythms being the best for me. I urge everyone to give it a few listens before making a judgement--their sound is offbeat enough that it might take a few to warm up to them. Once you get it--you will realize how hot a band they are!"
5,SpringFest 2011,"Great album!! To see it live you should go to Suwannee SpringFest 2011 in Live Oak, FL March 24-27. Discounted tickets for students and military. more info and tickets at [...]"
2,They aren't 17 oz. bottles,"I received my order and haven't tasted the sauce yet -- it's probably just fine -- but it's clearly not two 17-ounce bottles of sauce: it's two 12.7-ounce bottles ... almost a third smaller. I know this doesn't seem like a huge deal, but c'mon, I'm already paying through the nose for this stuff, don't rip me off even more."
5,Great series,"My children and I love this series. It is based off of The Mummy movies and focuses mainly on the boy, Alex, as he tries to control the manacle and defeat the mummy. I have not been able to find a volume 4 to this series which is disappointing. Volume three kinda leaves you hanging. This was a great DVD for all ages."
5,Another great one!,Another great Phryne Fisher adventure. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next one.
3,Lots of fun--nothing deep,"Maybe three stars is unfair--this mystery is very entertaining and the main character, Phryne Fisher, is totally appealing. This is the kind of mystery to read before you go to sleep because it will NOT keep you awake with either disturbing questions or a frantic, thrilling pace. Nor is it meant to be that type of mystery. It's cute and mildly amusing, and I think that's just what it aims to be. I tend to like my mysteries deeper and more thought-provoking, but this is a nice change of pace."
5,the second in the finest mystery series ever,"i have been reading mysteries for decades. i have favorite authors whose books i reread with pleasure. but my absolute favorite for the last ten years is kerry greenwood and her phryne fisher series.the novels are incredibly well-written and well researched, have wonderfully twisty plots, great dialogue, clothes, food and drink. phryne fisher is a complex and fascinating character with, thankfully, no angst or moral quandries. she has ethics and morals and acts on them fearlessly.there is humor of all kinds as well as suspense. the twisty plots also pay homage to the plots of the golden age of mystery, the period between the wars when mystery writing became culturally acceptable.even non-mystery lovers would enjoy the series for the fascinating facts from australian history. the only thing ms. greenwood doesn't include is footy, probably because our phyrne lives in st. kilda. it's not a noticeble lack."
5,No Such Thing as Too Big!,"Not only good for hot beverages, including that caffeine-overdose-sized morning coffee, these mugs also make great soup, chili, ice cream and cereal bowls! Add some color and fun to your kitchen with this great Fiestaware jumbo mug set!"
3,Don't use the dishwasher,"As soon as we had washed our cups in the dishwasher, maybe 3 times, the handles loosened and there was an audible rattle. We had to throw one out about a month after purchase and now treat the others with kid gloves. Not very practical."
4,Great Bag ...needs some design changes,"I like this bag alot. Sturdy, functional, great capacity. So far the only draw back I observed is that the shoulder staps are to close together.I am 6'5"" 270lbs with a 19 1/2"" neck. The straps adust enough to allow the bag to ride right( although the padding could have been 5"" longer. doesnt affect my rating) the biggest issue I have is that the straps squeeze my neck a little to much. I do realize that I am slightly out of the range of normal or avarage size and that I think the bag should be perfect for most individuals that buy this bag I highly recomend the bag and am thinking about buying a secound if I can find the woodland camo pattern bag availble.Buy the bag I don't think you will regret it."
3,good bag but.....,the bag held all my gear and then some. My only complaint is that the first time I used the bag the bottom feet fell off leaving screws sticking out. I contacted airsplat and they said for a fee they could order the parts. Still havnt heard what that fee is.
3,"The feet fall off after a few uses, makes it non water resistant","Looks cool, but I think it's poorly made. The feet fell off after only a few uses. Why does it need feet? Now I have to remove the screws and its not as water resistant with holes in it."
3,Alot of space and straps to wear it as a backpack,"I was looking for an all-in-bag for going to the range and being discreet about it. You can fit an AR-15 in it without taking it apart (16"" barrel w/stock collapsed). Could do away with the 6 foot pegs. I will be tossing the bottom stiffner and replacing it with two pieces of masinite.A thin dark piece (baked) for the bottom and thicker light piece on top of that. It is important to round the corners of the pieces if you do the same so that they dont tear of cut into the material. A good bad for the price is hard to come by. Use the right tool for the job. This bag will work well if not over stuffed (bulging zippers). Dont expect the feet to last."
4,Great replacement for Army OD Green Duffle Bag!,"This is a great replacement for the Army OD Green Duffle Bag. I always hated that the duffle is top loading. This one has a long zipper that give you access to the entire bag lengthwise. Has a shoulder strap too, but not really useful if you are using to it haul gear in the Army.It is accepted by the Army rules ""not to exceed 62 linear inches."" It also has no wheels which is also standard.The ONLY issue I have with this bag is that it has 4 ""pegs"" on the bottom of the duffle. While nice to have, when your bag gets thrown from Army trailers to commercial air, to C17, to C130, to Blackhawks, it takes a beating. Those 4 little pegs gets ripped away very easily. i had to pull it all out and duct tape the bottom. So...it doesn't last.I hope the manufacturer will get rid of those pegs. Otherwise a great bag, reasonable price, but probably will only be used for 1 deployment to get my stuff into and out of theater."
4,Overall Good,"Could be a bit sturdier. the feet on bottom are a PITA, not needed & since its soft floored it just cause items in bag to shift. a better bottom & deviders would have been nice. for under $30 good deal if above $40 so so."
5,Woodland Digital,"Received 4 days after placing my order. Not seen in the picture are the backpack straps, but they are there. Satisfied"
3,Great hinge -- while it works,"The Blum Compact 33 110 degree hinge is a great hinge,at least while it works. It operates smoothly, adjustseasily, and installs quickly: a cabinet-maker's dream.Unfortunately, that's about where the beauty of thehinge ends. The mean-time-to-failure of this hingeis about six years. Thus, I'd rate this itemas a replacement-only piece of hardware and avoid itfor new cabinet construction."
2,Agreed - they fail often,"I have to agree with the other reviews. My kitchen was installed with these hinges and I've been replacing them quite often. I'd estimate I have about 80 of them and so far in the past 4 years since I bought my house, I've replaced about 25% of them (and here I am shopping for more replacements).My advice... if you have these, buy them in bulk and have a few extra at all times because they will all eventually break and make that ""snap"" noise on open/close.Is it worth re-drilling all your cabinet doors and buying something more sturdy? I don't plan to. The replacement cost and effort is still pretty low. The faceplates seem to hold up well so you're only replacing the odd hinge every few years at $2 bucks a pop. And when they're not broken, they do indeed work rather well. Replacing them is easy enough, fortunately."
3,Blum replaced my defective hinges,"As others have mentioned, this type of hinge is subject to failure after only a few years. I took the advice of those who suggested calling Blum's customer service (1-800-438-6788). I was told that the hinges are under warranty (mine were installed in 2000). The company sent out the replacement hinges I requested at no cost. They arrived within a week. Kudos to Blum for standing behind their products."
1,Bum Blum Hinges,Blum 110 Degrees Knock In Self Closing Compact 33 HingeDo not buy this hinge! If you are replacing this defective product call Blum and get the all metal replacement. The plastic piece on the swing arm breaks and the hinge either will not stay open and/or makes a snapping sound. When you look inside the hinge mechanism and you can see the metal hinge pin then the plastic piece is broken off and this is the defect that all of these reviews are discussing.Good Luck
1,Good for only about 10 years.,"I have these hinges in all my kitchen cabinets. They were new in 1993.These hinges, in my opinion, have an engineering design flaw. Or maybe they were designed this way so you would have to buy new ones to replace the ones that fail.Anyway after about 10 years, the plastic spring mechanism that keeps the cabinet door closed starts to fail and the doors do not stay closed. I do not know if the plasitc has a short life span or what but a piece of the plastic breaks off and causes the self closing mechanism to stop working.My advice, look for something else."
3,BLUM 110 HINGE FAILS,"The bathroom medicine cabinet door hinge recently started to make that snapping noise when I opened or closed the door. I lubricated the hinge assembly and adjusted the mounting screw but that did not help and this morning (2/10/07) when I was retrieving an item from the cabinet shelf, the door hinge that was making the noise failed and the door almost fell off. The door has a glass mirror. Fortunately, the bottom hinge saved the door from completely falling off. According to Amazon reviews, the the life of this pedigree of hinge is about 6 years and it's kind of prophetic because I bought the house about 6 years ago. Perhaps the previous owners installed the cabinets shortly after I bought the house. Anyway, I have to search for one only pair of hinges as they are used only in one place, in my master bathroom.ECHOKILO in Duluth, Georgia."
1,Plastic Breaks!,"The plastic insert breaks! 3 of the 4 in my cabinets are broken. When both go on a door, it no longer closes. I am going to try calling Blum to get them to send replacements (there is supposed to be a lifetime warranty)."
2,Not a good hinge,"We've had our cabinet with Blum 33 hinges for only about 4 years, and a hinge just failed; the little plastic piece that maintains tension for closing the door broke. Using plastic for this purpose is not wise. Most people expect for the hinges to last for years and years, but this hinge doesn't pass the time test. The doors have not been used that much. It's not a real busy kitchen! Yes, it still works as a basic hinge, but the door won't stay closed and everyone bangs their head on it. Because I expect other hinges to also fail, I'm installing magnetic catches as a safety measure to prevent bruises on heads.Someone suggested a 39 for replacement, and I think that's a good idea too."
2,Required Replacement Hinge,"This was a propriarity replacement hinge that I was happy to find. My kitchen cabinents have tgese hinges and it is nearly impossible to change to a different hinge because of they are sunk into the doors. Problem is that there is a key component of this hinge that is plastic a breaks after so many cabinent door operations. This plastic piece keeps the door closed snug and afet it breaks, the door stands open a couple of inches. Good news... replacements are available (at a reasonable cost on Amazon). Bad news... the continue to break."
2,Don't last very long,If you use these hinges make sure you buy a lot of spares because they break after very little use.
3,Warranty Replacement of Blum 110 Degrees Self Closing Compact 33 Hinge,"I have a large number of these hinges in my kitchen, bathrooms and home office cabinets. A few years ago they started breaking with a snap, leaving a small black plastic piece on the floor. I called Blum at the customer service number given on other posts. The service person was friendly and, with no questions asked, shipped enough hinges to replace all my broken hinges. I wish all manufacturers warrantied their product like Blum. Hinge replacement only takes a couple of minutes and now the doors open and close like new."
1,Not fit for purpose,"Avoid this design at all costs:The hinge is fundamentally flawed by using a plastic part for the spring.As the hinge gets older the plastic degrades and eventually snaps.I have replaced around 15 of these in the last year (since buying my house).The previous owner replaced a load also - whilst he had free replacements, as the second owner I am not covered by the Blum warranty and will have to pay for the replacements myself.A bad design with a chronic failure rate, chose an all metal design hinge instead."
3,blum hinges,"these hinges came with the cabinets I own, so these are replacements. Longevity has been a problem. If starting from scratch, I would recommend finding better quality hinges."
4,Work great,bought these as replacement hinges. work great. occasionally i have to make sure the adjustment screw is tight so it doesn't slide.
4,BOO,"This book interestingly delves into ghost stories that were published in magazines in the Victorian era. Reprinting them allows one to see the historical and cultural influences that were prominent at the time, such as the development of a mass-capitalist economic system in Victorian England. The stories are not necessarily scary in a traditional sense but more intellectual and historical."
4,Excellent case!,"I just received my OUTRO case yesterday, and already I'm liking it alot! My iRiver H320 does fit snugly into the case. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, there are two leather holders attached to the bottom plate that you have to fold into place. By folding those holders into place, the H320 is supported from the top and bottom so that it won't slide out of the case! (Helps to read the directions as I found out) The case also comes with a detachable belt clip so that I can attach it to my belt whenever I'm outside or at the gym. If you're not satisfied with the original case that came with the H320, then perhaps you should look into this one. Personally, I think you'll like it!"
5,Best cast cover!,"Got a cast? You gotta get this! After getting my forearm set in a cast, no one at the clinic could give me really useful suggestions on cast protection and care. Searching the web, I found this product and decided to take a chance. Well, they're not exaggerating when they say you can swim with it! And you still have basic grabbing function from your hand, much better than theplastic bags I was using. The sealing end is a bit tight, and the rubber is thin for flexibility, so I highly recommend putting talc or other powder to help slipping it on without tearing it."
2,Best part of the book is the cover!,"As the title says, perhaps the best part of this book is the return of Phil Foglio as the illustrator!I have not liked the turn that these books have taken, but then again, no one forces me to buy them - it is more an increasingly waning hope that they will recapture some of the magik of the earlier series."
2,pathetic,"Another great writer sells out. Read the original series but forget the rest. Nothing but pap, bad puns, and even worse dialoque. It's obvious that Mr Asprin does very little in regards to providing imput on the new books. I was barely able to finish the book instead of throwing it away in disgust. To sum it up; this and the other myth books with the co-authors are pure garbage. The death of a good series and not a dignify one."
2,As bad as the last one,"The characters are flat, the story plods on and on and on. I used to not be able to put the Myth books down; now I almost have to force myself to finish them. This time it's credit cards and identify theft - once again, they aren't part of the story like Asprin used to write, they are the entire purpose of the story. Now with gratuitous violence and a formulaic protracted cliffhanger ending in the form of a big fight scene between Aahz and the Skeeve imposter - totally out of character and NOT what I read Myth books for. I've bought one or two more after this one, but I see there's a new one out (Myth-Chief) and I don't think I'll bother."
3,Missing out on the charm from the original series,"This book manages to take characters that we know so well and just tell a story. That's it. No character development, not much witty banter, and no clever solutions at the end that required a surprising lack of bloodshed, all of which characterized the first books written by just Aspirin. If this were the first book I read in the series, I wouldn't have read any more. But don't give up hope. In Class Dis-Mythed the authors finally reach their stride and tell a tale worthy of Myth Inc!"
2,Pretty Bad,"This was a truly disappointing fall from the standard that the MYTH series had previously upheld. The first twelve or so books were pretty good, and quite fun. This one...was not.Where to start? First, like the later Xanth novels, this suffered mightily from the desire to be funny, but lacked the cred. Introducing a distant location and filling it with zany jokes and madcap is a good sign that something is terribly wrong. Having the characters run around without any kind of character development, at all, is another good sign.Let me say, though, that I disagree with so many that the problem is Jody Lynn Nye. I think that it is really, really hard to maintain the funny forever. I guess perhaps eventually Robert Aspirin lost it. <Shrug>.Harkius"
4,Stetson Hat Company History,"Do you have an old Stetson hat and wonder what it's worth? This book may help. It also contains a history of the company, photographs, as well as a section on women's hats manufactured by Stetson. I often refer people to the section on care and the handling of hats."
5,GREATEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!,I couldn't put this book down! I finished it in less than 24 hours. It captivates your senses. The book brings you to ancient Japan. I can't wait to read the sequal which I HOPE to get soon. Seikei shows great courage. And you could actually fall in love with Tomomogi. You also get to hear short stories from ancient Japan! I hope you enjoy it!
4,It was OK.,"My son had to read this for his fifth grade class. It was a heavy read for a 10 year-old. He enjoyed parts of it and found it entertaining, but it was a bit difficult for a fifth grader."
3,The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn,"This book is about Seikei, a merchants son, who has a dream to be a Samurai. One night, Seikei thought he saw a jininiki with a jewl that he saw earlier. Seikei followed it and in the morning started a case with judge Ooka to find the thief. In the end, Seikei finds out that......I'm not going to tell you. You'll just have to read the book and find out for yourself!"
4,My Third Period Book Report,"I enjoy mystery books, and this book was my favorite so far. This book takes place in Osaka and Edo of Japan. The conflict is that a jewel has been stolen from a daimyo named Lord Hakuseki. The theme is that a young merchants son named Seikei, the only witness,is helping the famous Judge Ooka (also known as the Japanese Sherlock Holmes)solve this mystery. My favorite part of the book was when Seikei is presented with a sword, even though he is a merchants son. In Japan, only a samorai can have swords. My least favorite part was when Seikei described the ""Ghost of the Tokaido Inn"". He described it as""...larger than a man, eyes flashing menacingly, huge horns..."". Seikei meet a traveling kabuki, or troupe,where he is forced to stay for a long period of time. Seikei feels that he is as good as a samauri should be, and writes poetry just like a samauri. This exciting book was very hard for me to put down, and it may just leave you hanging!"
3,Proper English speaking investigations,"Investigations in other English speaking countries are basically the same as those in the United States. This is like watching ""the Shift"" filmed with British Police."
1,Don't buy.,Don't waste your money. This show is crap. I couldn't even get through the first DVD because it was so boring. I was expecting a show in comparison of the forensic shows found on what use to be Court TV. It will be going to the recycle bin to trade for something better.
5,Buy Early in Med School,"Book is very helpful and should be bought early during med school. It will make sure that you know frequently tested topics. Also great along w/ first aid for board prep. There are a few mistakes as this is a 1st edition book, but the book is well worth $20."
1,it's complete waste of money!,Please! please! do not buy this one! it's complete waste of money! Do not deceived by its photo!! it is a completely different product! Cheap material! Very very poor quality! looks like somebody made this one for practice! just big junk of cheap plastic! I can not understand why Lucas Film allow this company to produce such a embarrassing product! All star wars fans! Please!! DO NOT BUY! even for one year old baby!
4,DEAD IMAGES DANCE,"DECASIA: THE STATE OF DECAY (Plexifilm), an experimental art film by Bill Morrison is edited entirely from bits and pieces of decomposed film found in neglected archives. Hallucinatory and haunting, the damaged images of places, people and events from times past are strange and out-of-context, but the brain tries to makes sense of them and the result is like a waking dream. Michale Gordon's innovative soundtrack of detuned instruments adds to the weird Dervish dance of dissolution."
5,Now available on Blu-ray (and back in print),"DECASIA - unavailable for some years - is not back in print thanks to Icarus Films and available now on BLU-RAY - even better. Watching this film and listening to the music is an amazing experience. Fabulous. (as is the filmmaker's other recent release, The Miners' Hymns)."
5,A Million Little Pieces,"""Decasia: The State of Decay"" is not a film for everyone, especially those who get easily bored. This film has no plot, no car crashes, or self-involved actors. It's essentially a film about entropy, about things falling apart. But it really isn't ""about"" anything at all. The opposite of a soundtrack, ""Decasia"" is a collection of images taken from archaic, decaying film reels that are used to accompany a musical composition. Occasional glimpses of a partial storyline appear like ghosts between the cracks and bubble of rotting celluloid. It's hypnotic to watch, and evokes a strange sense of wonder. Again, not everyone's cup of tea, but well worth the viewing."
4,A good book to read,"I am working in robotic control field. I found this book is interesting and good to read for control engineers. However I want to have some suggestions:- Authors should give more explanation, example for math equations since this book is ""Engineering Approach"" not ""Theoretical Approach"".- More example problems, case studies at the end of each chapter."
2,Nice Try,I enjoyed this book despite the low rating I gave it. It was a good try. The characters are believable if not a bit overdone. The plot is understandable and easy to follow however this book lacks excitement of any sort. It's a neutral read throughout the whole book. This made it sort of dull in some places. It is worth reading but don't expect much.
5,"Includes over 1,700 bibliographic references","A million Afro-Americans are quilters, and some believe recent studies of oral histories telling of their quilting roots have inspired more black women to take up the art. Hicks provides the first comprehensive guide to Afro-American quilt history and modern practice and serves as a reference to the subject, recommended especially for college-level holdings. Black Threads: An African American Quilting Sourcebook compiled by Kyra Hicks includes over 1,700 bibliographic references covering exhibit catalogs, books, newspapers, films, speeches and more -- and offers primary research conducted by Hicks on the Internet usage of Afro-American quilters. Black Threads will prove to be a unique and invaluable guide."
5,i love 'em,"wonderful bagpipes, good instrucions. The only problem i had was with the reeds, they constantly have to be adjusted. No matter, i am VERY satisfied with everything else."
3,Doesn't work for my Vista OS computer!,"I can't tell the CD is good or not because it doesn't work for my Windows Vista. My 2 computers won't install it. I try many times, but it still doesn't work!"
2,"Critical Topic, but there are better sources","The ""center"" and growth of Christianity is no longer in the West (if it ever was). African missiologist Lamin Sanneh uses a question and answer format to address issues and inform the reader about the growth, theology, and practice of Christianity outside of the West. Although this is a vital topic, Sanneh's writing style is often difficult to comprehend. The title alone enticed me to read this book and hoped to consider it for a course, but I was disappointed because of the format, [lack of] accessibility in the writing style, and content. I would instead recommend Philip Jenkins' booksThe Next Christendom: The Coming of Global ChristianityandThe New Faces of Christianity: Believing the Bible in the Global Southfor much more readable and in-depth looks at Christianity beyond the West."
1,Absolute worst I've seen in a while!,"Got to be the cheapest, worst graphics I have ever seen in years! Looks like scenery is painted on a flat piece of cardboard. The control is terrible. The bouncy, bouncy motion is just too stupid for words.What a waste of time."
3,"Great game, doesn't work on Vista","The graphics and effects are excellent, the handling etc is different between each car, the damage effects are great fun, since the cars aren't officially licensed by the car companies like other games, you get more damage effects than broken windows.Unfortunately, the game doesn't work with Vista because of their copy protection scheme. (Doesn't even do what it is designed to do, all it does is make it not work with Vista.../soapbox)Couple more details:no clutch control, no dual monitor support, so in those regards, it's a typical game.Overall, if you have XP, give this a shot. It's a lot of fun. The Steam version might work with Vista, so that's worth a try."
2,A little disappointed,"I am normally an extremely fair individual about reviewing games. I had so much trouble running this game on my desktop with Win 7 64bit and a dual processor, that I tried to run it on my single core processor laptop. This still didn't work for me. After trying to get some product support, which doesn't exist anymore I got totally fed up and just downloaded a ""pirated"" version. I figure I sure wasn't stealing anything since I owned the original in my hands. This should make all game producers take note of the DRM fad that's sweeping the gaming industry. In all fairness though, the game is really good if you can get it to run on your rig."
2,Monotonous and close-minded,"When I first read this book, I could not help but wonder why the author sounded so angry! The entire text could have been written in 20 pages, but tends to drag on monotonously, repeating statements many times in the same aggressive tone. The tone and repetition of the text tends to lead you away from the few morsels of interesting and useful information, such as the wonderfully concise overview of basic chinese medicine that even a lay person could understand. It is such a shame that this book was so horribly written with it's truly advanced use of the English language, that it is difficult to follow, understand, and even pick up again to finish. This is no light reading, folks."
4,Great for very casual moments,"I needed a watch for every day use. When I first receive it it looked smaller than I thought it would be, but once on my wrist it looks pretty cute. For this amazing price, I couldn't ask for anything better."
2,Adverts,This item is ok on arrival. Items are well packaged and neatly boxed. But the advert looks misleading. It looks big in the ads than in reality.Regret buying it. Never enjoyed it but will return it for obvious reason.
5,reloj casio,"excelente vendedor el producto llego en el tiempo estimado , lo recomiendo cien porciento, la mercancia llwgo en buenas condiciones y el pedido si era lo que esperaba"
4,Awesome Musical Score!,"The music in this film is as diverse as it is brilliant. Chopin, French rap, African rhythm and Al Green; Need I say more. How can I get the musical score?"
2,Careful if you don't speak French,"I can't comment on the movie since I have not watched it. But I did purchase this from the Amazon France site since it was not available here last year. No English subtitles on mine. So if you don't speak French, this DVD may not be so great."
1,plotless and dull,"The movie is almost insulting - a cat wedged unnoticed behind an oven for several days (please!)while its owner wanders around the neighborhood meeting some very dull people. Parisians may think their city is unique, but this movie conveys nothing...most ridiculous is the notion that it takes the loss of this woman's cat to transfer her from an isolated wallflower into a woman with a social life...yet she is stunningly beautiful and works as a make-up artist for photo models - a real wallflower scenario...this movie ambles and wanders on for hours of banal situations and banal dialogue. But it seems some people think that anything French must be profound..."
1,One movie with no plot,"Please, don't spend your money on this movie, my friends and I rented a bunch of French movies one night on an all night movie run and we rated this one the worst hands down with no exceptions. The acting is such that you keep watching the movie expecting it to go away. We watched the whole thing waiting to have it go somewhere and it didn't. There are so many other great french movies, you shouldn't waste your money on this one."
2,Christmas? Not really...,"The packaging of this tape makes it appear as if it's a Pooh Christmas video. Not only is it not, but it's nothing more than various clips from existing episodes pieced together. My two-year-old loses interest quickly, which is just as well, b/c I'm concerned about some of the sequences being too scary/maudlin. It's tough enough to be two!"
3,It's okay,"My 4-year-old son LOVES this movie! While I'm glad that he likes it, I find the last video (with Rabbit and Kessie the bird) one of the most annoying Pooh videos ever created. I feel like I got my money's worth out of it, though."
4,It's Sweet,"My son really likes this Whinnie the Pooh story. It really is a sweet little Christmas story. I'm happy my son likes it. I, however, can not watch it as frequently as he does. It's cute the first time and maybe once a year, in my opinion. But they didn't make this movie for me."
2,I was disappointed with this video - not a classic.,"My son absolutely loves Winnie The Pooh and has the original ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"". I was excited to see that a new full length video had been released, but I was very disappointed in what I saw. The animation is not done very well and it seems like it was just slapped together to make sure it was released before the Christmas season. Annoying things to me include the fact that Rabbit is green, and I remember him being yellow in the original and the fact that it looks like the characters don't blend in with their backgrounds - in other words it wasn't done very well. The original is far superior to this one.My son still looks at it as he is only 2 years old, but as an adult it is a disappointment."
1,A very disappointing rerun of Disney's daily t.v. cartoon,"This video has some new animation introducing reruns of two of their morning cartoon shows. My Children were very disappointed that they had seen most of it before. Disappointing for us as well, the package states it is a ""new full length adventure"". Not worth spending money on. Just turn on your television."
2,"Good layout of a problem, but few solutions.","This book is worth reading just to get a sense of the way the American public views business today. The stories of businesses told in this book are one-sided and even irrational, but without a doubt, they reflect the way American business is seen by the public right now.The problem with the book is that it offers very few ideas on how a business can successfully navigate today's minefield of public perception. As a reader hoping to come away with ideas on how to nurture the public's perception of my business, I instead finished the book feeling that businesses are largely at the mercy of dumb luck and circumstance when it comes to perception. Further, the author admits that businesses are in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation when attempting to let the public know about any acts of goodwill.This book is well-timed to take advantage of today's anti-business climate, but not of much help for those seeking to find their way through it."
1,delayed,delayed for like 4 months...decided i didnt want to wait and that ruined my 10 dollar off deal.
4,Good replacement bulb for Kenmore Microwave,"Finding these bulbs was a pain in the neck. I bought a Kenmore microwave at Sears and couldn't find the replacement bulbs anywhere once my bulb burned out. Got lucky and found them on Amazon. If you have a Kenmore Elite microwave, these bulbs will work with it."
4,"Mac Mall, dope as always","This album is Mac Mall's first nationwide and it definitely shows off some of his mike skills. He's been doing it for years in the Bay, and songs like Get Right, Untouchable and song 2, I forget the name, prove he belongs in the big leage. However, if you want to see him at his best, find a copy of Illegal Business, his first underground album. It may be the best Bay Area product ever produced."
4,Good underground Cali rapper,"I had never heard of Mac Mall until a couple months ago, and the other day I was at the record store and spotted this cd and remembered it was supposed to be pretty good and decided to pick it up. It turned out to be worth the price. The first quarter of the cd is the best and there are scattered other great tracks such as ""Get Right"", ""Pimp or Die"", and ""Crestside""."
4,Must have nostalgia,"This is a must have CD for any fan of SF Bay area rap. Very nostalgic, reminds me of the good ol' days. I don't know if it's on the top 5 best ever list, but a good CD nonetheless, esp. if you like E-40, San Quinn, Guce, 11-5 etc. Good old school, from about 1995 I think. The 3 or 4 good tracks make it worth having."
3,Mediocre,"The movie was somewhat informative and was very personalized, which was good. But it was pretty slow and mostly depressing without any hope for a solution."
5,THE CLASS ROOM FAVORITE,"Son said nice book, he had to read this book for a class project, he said after falling asleep several times, it was a nice book."
4,5th Graders Review,I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT GOES BACK IN TIME WHEN THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I FOR ONE LIKED THE PART WHERE POCAHONTAS HAS TO HELP HER BROTHER PRACTICE FOR HUNTING BY THROWING FRISBEES UP IN THE AIR AND HIM TRYING TO SHOOT THEM WITH HIS ARROWS. I ALSO LIKED THE PART WHERE THE CHIEF (POCAHONTAS' DAD) AND SOME OF HIS MEN GO TO TRY TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE COATMEN. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN POCAHONTAS GOES WITH HER DAD TO SEE THE COATMEN AND TRY TO TALK WITH THEM. I ALSO LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS LIKE HISTORY IN A FUN KIND OF WAY. IT TALKS ABOUT WHEN INDIANS AND WHITE MEN ARE TRYING TO MAKE PEACE AND HOW JOHN SMITH AND HIS COATMEN FOUND LAND. I REALLY THINK THAT ALMOST EVERY ONE WILL LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE YOU ARE LEARNING HISTORY IN A FUN WAY. AND I RECOMENDED THIS BOOK FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE IT GOES BACK IN TIME AND HOW THINGS RELLY WORKED A LONG TIME AGO AND BECAUSE OF HOW FUN THIS BOOK IS TO READ. I AM IN THE 5TH GRADE AND I LIKE THIS BOOK A LOT!
2,Doesn't fit the OM wiper blade,Bought this for a 2008 Camry Hybrid. The info said it would. It did not. The mounting port of the replacement blade is too narrow.
5,it isn't really like that...,"it isn't really like that. it's not just some disconcerting look into the underground of the east village full of drugs and sex and blah blah blah -- that's every other review. what's actually in this book is centred more around style than substance. ms. listfield writes powerfully, artistically, and honestly in these vignettes; she writes like comfort food. this is the kind of book where every line is the type of line you're prone to underlining or reading allowed to whoever will listen, the kind of sentences you want to carry along in your pocket for their brilliance. i recognised myself on every page.all in all it's not the work of the century, but genuinely, genuintely worth the read."
2,"Tips good, Holder poor","The holder only lasted for one day of use, and that was not even heavy use. The outside shaft of the Vermont American holder froze in place and would not extend to remove the bit after one day of use. It appears to be the same design as the Dewalt but the Dewalt holders still work. I use the #1 and #2 square bits along with nut drives for electrical work. I would not recommend this for anyone who plans to use it a lot. This may have been a fluke but I will stick with the Dewalt at this time/"
3,Exploratory and unnecessary,"For being a prequel to the great book Eon, this was a huge let down. The simple idea for a Eon prequel is fascinating and using Olmy as a character in a book makes me giddy. Again, such a let down. Legacy should have been an entirely seperate book which explores the planet of Lamarckia.Lamarckia is such an interesting idea. The plant/foliage/being/queen thing was explored thoroughly. That left me satisfied, at least. But for Legacy to be part of The Way series, I was disappointed. The story starts off well enough with Olmy having to go on a mission to Lamarckia. which is down The Way a bit. Then the story becomes about sailing and biology. Sailing? The only time I want to read about sailing is if the ship is a huge solar sail.Another redeeming factor of Legacy is the depth in which we get to know Olmy. Olmy was a great guy in both Eon and Eternity. From Legacy, we get to know that he's a ladies man. Unnecessary? Yes."
3,Average,"Greg Bear creates a very fascinating world, but he doesn't go anywhere with it. The main character's very vague mission is to study the planet and the society that develops there. All this takes place with the background plot of a weak love story and a civil war. I found the descriptions of the 'ecoi' very interesting and enjoy that kind of writing. It's too bad he couldn't think of a plot, other than the main character wandering around describing things, to go with it. A book I would read once and will never pick it up again."
2,lousy characters,"I thought this book had rather poor character development. When a story is told in first person you expect to get into the character's head a little bit and understand their motivations. This never really happens with this book. The idea of dealing with an alien ecosystem in a colonial setting was interesting, but the telling was uneven and disjointed, leaving much wanting."
4,Almost as good as #1,"The First book was a little better...This book tells the story of Tig and his Bossy but beautiful New bride and a Dangerous trek across the ocean. It is a Little slow going at places but i think sets the reader up for the 3rd book nicely, with the surprise twist towards the end of the book. the humour was not as good in this book as the fist one, and Tig seemed to lack the Cleverness from book #1, but this was still a very nice read...Relic113"
4,Plain old-fashioned fun!,"Bradley is pretty inventive. She's not the most sophisticated writer but the stories are always good. I enjoyed the Gil Trilogy a lot. This book is fairly good, book three is the best!"
1,2 of 2 units faled the same way,We bought this for our son and he enjoyed it until it failed a few months later. The unit would no longer power up correctly. We received a replacement unit and it failed the same way within a few weeks. I can't recommend anyone buy this product.
5,We love it!,"I bought this product initially at a garage sale. My 8 yr old loved it so much he opted to sleep on the floor instead of his loft bed for over a week just so he could watch the stars. It is full of information and has only encouraged my son to delve deeper into space. He has learned so much that his 3rd grade teacher asked him to teach the class a little about space. We took the planetarium to school, and it fell off a stool. It still works, but it no longer rotates. He loves it so much, we are buying him another one. We highly recommend this toy!"
2,Great....until it stopped working,"We had this for less than a year. After that, a bulb burned out and it stopped rotating altogether - and would only project the stars at the north pole.It has the most information, the best features, and the most thorough (northern and southern hemisphere) coverage. However, you can't use any of that once it stops working.My 10 year old daughter treated this as if it were fragile glass and went to sleep to the starscape every night. She LOVED it!When it suddenly stopped working, we called the technical support - willing to buy parts, bulbs, etc. But, they informed us that they don't really sell the bulbs - even though that's what it says in the manual - and they haven't got any support suggestions. So, they were useless. No refund, no return, no exchange - out of warranty and out of luck.Unfortunately, there is nothing out there that compares to this in terms of features and price. So, we will simply do without."
3,Nothing Special,I purchased this for my daughters birthday. She is really into the stars and the plantets. We were disappointed to find out you cant see the plantets. This has turned into just a big nightlight in her room. She loves laying in bed and being able to look at the stars.
2,Nice idea... poorly executed. Expensive with low quality.,"I got this for my son for Christmas a few years back. At first, this seemed like a really cool toy. Its one of the few planetariums that actually project white stars instead of the inverse. Unfortunately, it was plagued by defects related to low quality. At first, a wire became disconnected from the planet projector light bulb. I soldered it back on and it worked. But ultimately what did it in was the failure of a position sensor on the main projector mechanism. The projector would keep turning and turning even after hitting the mechanical stop. I gave up and ended up throwing out this very expensive toy after only a month. My son was very disappointed. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,don't be fooled..these songs are NOT new releases as stated.,I had been waiting for a new Relativity reggae compilation and am disappointed in this release. Relativity should bring back the LETHAL RIDDIMS series.
3,Fat Joke,"Okay, that comment may be a bit harsh but I do recommend treading carefully if you're considering buying this album. Content-wise, Jealous One's Envy is a pretty one-dimensional representation of the East Coast thug experience. Fat Joe doesn't possess a captivating style of rhyme nor is he able to grab your attention with his storytelling ability. The beats generally carry this album but when they falter, the album simply drags."
1,Corny... Stop trying to be like ll cool j you fat f*ck...,"Fat joe's ""jealous one's envy"" is as corny as it gets coz it ain't even good or nuthing and it gets realy boring after-a-while. Faag joe ain't no realy mc besides the fact that his voice will realy give you a huge head ache. The only latin rapper i've respect for is Bug pun and it will only be him coz the rest? All suck. Faag joe is corny yooo!!!"
4,Grandson loves it!,"I purchased the remote control dragon for my 11 year old grandson as a Christmas gift. He loves it. He has owned two other remote control toys from Discovery.com, both dinosaurs, and enjoyed them a great deal. Now he's into dragons so I knew I couldn't go wrong by getting this one for him. It works great, looks great and has all the 'bells and whistles' that kids like. I'm not sorry I bought this product and would consider buying it for another child's gift."
2,Discovery Dragon Toy,"I bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas because he saw it in a magazine and thought it ""was cool"". He played with it for about 5 min. on Christmas morning and hasn't touched it since. Would be better for younger kids...."
3,great gift,"I bought this for my seven year old nephew and he loves it. It takes many batteries (two for the remote and four for the dragon, I think) so stock up! It walks, moves its wings, the eyes and mouth light up, and it makes some sort of roaring noise. I am not sure how long it will last with two brothers, but they both love it(ages 7 and 5). I don't think it would be exciting for a boy a year or two older as actions/movements are limited to what I wrote above."
2,Fun but not durable,"I bought this dragon for my 5 year old he had fun playing with it but it did not last long , as wings always comes off and then some parts of it started come off"
3,Great buy!,"Great unit for the money! I did some extensive research on prices and features and this JVC model topped them. Almost as good as the Kenwood system I had stolen out of my vehicle. The remote is a great addition, but the size could be a bit larger or come with a bunge-type cord attached. I keep losing the darn thing. With that aside, I'm very pleased with my choice!"
3,i liked it but....,"The book was pretty not believable to me but it touched romantic hearts. The relationship between the 2 women happens real quick, The issues they face together seem more believable ,but overall a good non believable bbok."
3,Couldn't get into it,Started reading this book but it just didn't grab me. Perhaps it is the author's style but I did not find the characters to be compelling and the story did not take off like it should have. I put it down after reading 1/3 of the book.
4,Good read,Meghan has done it again. Its an interesting story and like all her other books doesn't leave u disappointed. I will definitely recommend it
4,Great Beatnuts LP,"just bought this LP, and I'm totally satisfied! Old school hip hop, can't mess with that thun. Best track is track 7"
4,This is what hiphop should be,"Nice album, amazing production, and intellectual lyrics. This album should be part of any real hiphop collection. Didnt give 5 stars because I am a hard critic."
4,"Pretty, but not a windchime.","I received this last week. It is really very pretty, but I have a couple of complaints. The box it came in said windchime. However, it does not chime. It hardly makes a sound even if you knock the teardrops together. The copper wires surrounding the glass drops prevent them from chiming. (I wondered about this before I ordered it.) My other complaint is although it was well-packaged, by the time I had cut the tape and removed the tissue from each teardrop, I had a tangled mess. I was nearly ready to throw it away before I got it untangled. Anyway, now it is hanging on my front porch and makes a nice decoration. The colors are vibrant and the it seems well-made. Surprisingly, it does not tangle, even when the wind blows it. I do wish it had clear line or thin wire instead of the black nylon cords holding the teardrops, but that's not a big deal. Overall, I'm happy with it. I'm going to order an actual windchime, though."
1,terrible,"arrives all tangled, suggest you discontinue this product...I threw it out of frustration...definitely not a purchase you want to make."
2,problems,"When I received this item two of the teardop pendants were loose in the box and a 3rd one was sticking out of the side of it spiral casement. I had to spend some considerable time putting the whole thing together again. I've also discovered, after being only a few weeks outside, that the bronze coating on the spiral casings are cracking, discoloring and peeling off. Pretty for a a week or so but fraught with problems."
1,Cheap Construction,"This pump is made of cheap plastic materials. The pumping mechanism does not turn very well and wants to seize up, even after lubrication. The plastic handle on my pump broke after just the second use. I do not recommend this pump."
4,Good Pump,"I bought this plastic pump for pumping water from a 55 gallon plastic barrel. It is a solid, heavy duty construction and does the job well."
3,Plastic Rotary Barrel Pump,Pump works adequately but I am concerned that it may be made with plastics too light to last long - feels a little flimsy.
1,"Buy Mary Blewitts book instead. Milligan's book, not so good","Milligan lays out the process for you, but does very little in explaining what is going on within the process.He pools a LOP right in with the noon shot. I didn't like that, The book draws no line between the noon shot, and determination of LP's and the the use of sight red. tables. He doesn't make it clear that you don't need S.R. tables when you do a noon shot.I found myself asking when will I use these S.R. tables during the noon shot. He leaves out details when it comes to teaching the inexperinced."
3,didn't quite fit,"It did not quite fit due to not having a foam boarder around the filter like the one in my car ('06 grand prix) has. I got it to work but cutting a small piece of wood lathe and putting it along side to make up for the lose. It will work, it just seems a bit loose without any sort of wedging. I probably will look for some other filter brand in 60k miles, for $30 the filter should fit perfectly..... I was also kind of disappointed in the quality of the filter, seemed like a gloried bounty paper towel with a thin boarder......"
4,Couples Who Take Care: Elders Weathering the Years with Strength and Love,"I admire Diekemper's courage and conviction in writing a text like this. At first, the book seems too simply written. But, that is the purpose of the writing style - to appeal to anyone. It is filled with short segments, interviews and conversations with elders growing older with insight and love. It can be read cover to cover, or just by the chapter. Whenever we want encouragement, whenever we want to appreciate relationships more, whenever we want a feel good heart-filled experience, we can pick up the book, and give ourselves and our partner a hug."
2,Cheap but usable,"I used this solder right next to some smaller diameter Kester. Solder is solder, right? Guess again! Solder flux is not solder flux, and there is a world of difference between good flux and cheap flux, and this stuff has cheap flux in it. If you need to save a penny and have an easy job, you can get by with this stuff. But I'm a penny-pencher, and I'll gladly spend the extra pennies next time to buy higher quality solder."
5,Tons of information!,"This book is packed with almost anything you might want to know on a variety of kilns and firing techniques. This book is a must have for anyone interested in firing, building, or experimenting with their own kilns."
4,"Recommended for researchers, students","This book is the heavyweight of books on performance appraisal, in terms of size, price and detail. As such it's an excellent reference book for researchers, hr professionals, students and academics if their interest is the ""traditional"" way of doing appraisals.On the other hand, it is not as practical for managers, due to its size and price. Or rather there are better choices. One other significant disadvantage of this book is that it is traditional, and lacks new ideas or approaches such as put forth by Deming, Scholtes and Coens.Of course the manager who likes to read on these topics will also gain. It's just that these days it's hard to get anybody to read anything related to work that is this size."
5,classic mingus-dolphy collaboration,"The other review here refers to Vol 2. of this live material (and is also listed under that title). I'm sure that reviewer would sing equally high praises for the material on this disc. The jams on this are a bit more extended, giving Dolphy more time to stretch out. Highly recommended for anybody wishing to explore Dolphy, or fill out their Mingus collection."
3,Probably a good muzzle,Made of leather. Be sure to measure you dogs head before purchasing a muzzle. Yes it does matter. I did not use it on my dog because I measured incorrectly.
3,Difficult to find halogen bulb,"I have only managed to find this bulb once before, by pure chance Lowes happened to have some in stock. Otherwise Amazon is the place of choice to get this odd T4 bulbs.So, how do they fare? They give a nice bright light but they do not last particularly well, which is disappointing considering their inflated cost. We have 3 of these in our over counter lamps and have burned through 4 of them in under 2 years.In short, I would certainly not recommend a fitment that takes these. Go for LEDs instead."
5,They Work!,"I needed replacement bulbs for over my cooktop but the Home Depot didn't have the wattage I needed (which was 25w) so I thought hey, I'll check Amazon and here it was. I received my bulbs in a reasonable time frame, they were exactly what I ordered, they fit just as they should and work perfectly. No complaints here!"
4,Misleading title -and- Good book,"Both DeFoor's and neurotex's reviews are correct. The title is misleading because it overreaches the actual content of the book. A more accurate title would be ""An Introduction to Aeronautical and Aerospace Pyrotechnics,"" and the reader should note that the book was published in 1974. A reasonable place to begin, and also historically interesting.Two short passages from the author's introduction illustrate the actual scope of the book:Today, pyrotechnics find extensive applications in spacecraft, aircraft and underwater vehicle systems, and also in production methods, for example for metal forming, cladding, and riveting.It is recommended to use this handbook together with the book ""Military and Civilian Pyrotechnics"" by Dr. Herbert Ellern, published by the Chemical Publishing Company, which contains more detailed information about the properties and production of pyrotechnic materials and an extensive manufacturing formulary."
4,My first Roth,"and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Mickey Sabbath was so real that even his status as an absolutely moral-less anti-hero couldn't push me far enough away not to feel sorry for him as the story went on. Reading this book made me want to go out and do something totally outrageous just to feel more alive.I agree with many of the other reviewers.David Duke (the narrator of the audio book) did a superb job with accents, emotions and even sexual noises (although I wish he would have done the gorilla noises toward the end).The sex was too analytical to be erotic in most cases (which is good if you happen to be standing in line at the post office listening to it on tape). I do have to admit I fast forwarded through one of the scenes I found particularly disgusting and I wish I would have fast forwarded through another one of the scenes."
2,Pretty boring and just about gagged me,"Okay, I didn't really like Portnoy's Complaint either although I appreciate it as a coming of age type of novel. This novel is like Portnoy grows old and still does disgusting things with his body fluids. Even worse, the plot dragged. I feel as though I'm reading the reminiscences of a stunted teenager who hasn't a clue that he's stunted."
4,A very disturbant pupeteer,"At first I thought this would be one heavy reading. But as I went along, I felt something going. I can't deny that the sexual content improved my interest a lot, but there is something more. Something that tells you about human nature and some dark secrets we try to keep hidden. Leaves you with some thoughts that don't help you go to sleep."
3,Everyman's Theater,"I read this book after I read Everyman and I am surprised at how the two books are similar, right until the graveyard scene where Sabbath/Everyman meets his digger: The childhood in New Jersey, the relationship with the parents, the much-admired older brother, how he misses his youth and how much he is scared of death, the European mistresses. How many times can one write the same novel?"
1,A very great dissapointment,"Having read other of Philip Roth's novels,very good indeed, I bought this title Sabbath's Theater. It has good prose since Roth is a good narrator, but I kept feeling like not reading the book at all at several moments during the story.I admire Roth for other books, but make yourself a favor do not buy it."
2,A Pointless Read,"After enjoying American Pastoral, I bought Sabbath's Theater in a used book store excited to give it a chance. Instead, I found myself very disappointed with this novel. While some credit his use of characters of moral ambiguity, I found his characters rather unbelievable, unlikable, and therefore uninteresting. The main character, Mickey Sabbath, might be complicated and, some might argue, ""deep,"" but his bizarre and crude antics make it difficult to care when so you have to struggle painfully through hundreds of pages of convoluted back story supposedly explaining why he has slipped so far. I found the numerous and sometimes gruesome sex scenes distasteful, despite the fact that I am usually neutral or even glad to have such content. Overall, I found this novel boring, disgusting, tedious, and forgettable. All in all a pointless read."
3,Sabbath at Rest,"I have enjoyed several of Roth's books including Portnoy's Complaint, When She Was Good, American Pastoral, and Patrimony. This novel displays Roth's writing style as well as any other. Mickey Sabbath is living in the hell that he has cultivated for himself and has earned. If Roth's intent was to create a sympathetic figure with Sabbath he has failed with me. All persons have suffered something in the past that could explain, if not condone, some irresponsible behaviors. For Sabbath, however, I feel nothing--not because of his hedonism but because of his irresponsibility and insensitivity to those with whom he interacts. Sabbath rests in hell. He is indeed his own puppet and directed the show. It's hot in the theater."
2,Beautiful Prose But No Redeeming Value,"I truly enjoy dark characters, but this book provided no entertainment what so ever. However well-written, I could not appreciate the ""hero's"" horrible treatment of wives, friends and lovers. Although nearly every page is about sexual exploits, they were not remotely erotic. Of course, erotism was not the point of the book. But maybe it could have made the read more bearable."
1,Another National Book Award Flop,"Apparently there's something special about Philip Roth and his writing that escapes me. This novel was a complete waste of my time. I struggled to the middle then simply dumped it. The story is about a self-loathing, conflicted, sexually addicted misogynist who has lost all connection to anything humane. The writing style is dull and after 200 pages I didn't find a single character likable. The story is laced with the main character's sexual escapades but after a while even that loses it shock value and becomes numbing. It's good to see that I am not alone in my assessment of this novel. From the reviews posted you either really enjoy it or not. For me . . . NOT! Can't recommend this one."
2,Tiresome and tedious,"For a novel that garnished such high praise, I expected better. I had to work and force myself to finish. I never became engaged with the character or the story."
1,Roth's Worst,"For the life of me I can't understand how it got the Book Award. It's a pointless heap of drivel without any appealing characters. Roth also combines multiple quotes in the same paragraph causing confusion about who's speaking. That, plus long rambling confused stntences with no direction make reading it a head pounding chore. I quit after reading to the half way point. This muddled mess is not worth your time."
2,Not a particularly interesting read,"I found this book to be overly vulgar and I did not assimilate in any way with the main character, Sabbath. I have not read anything else by Phillip Roth, so I cannot attest that this is how all of his books were, but I think I just did not like his style. Basically, every page had some sort of vulagrity on it, and to me it served no purpose. The characters were, in general, not likable. They were not the type of people I would like to know, and thus don't enjoy reading about them. This book could be enjoyable if you can identify with sabbath in some way, but since I couldn't, I did not enjoy it. (It was awfully long to not enjoy, too)"
2,Obsessive and boring sexology,"Having read Roth since ""Goodbye Columbus"" I can honestly say that, in spite of his brilliant narrative skills and scintillating dialogue this book's content,the repetitive use of sexual scatology, the obsession with sexual deviance was first shocking and ultimately boring. Compared to "" The Counter Life "" it rates a 3 at best. As I struggled through the book I wondered what possessed Phillip to write it."
2,Lust personified&#65533;is an ugly thing.,"Mickey Sabbath's life is one pathetic misadventure after another. An arthritic street performer, who once used his fingers as his puppets, he lives for his next sexual adventure. Any other ties to humanity, love, trust, honesty, (although he claims this value, he only uses it when it suits him) are lost amidst his pursuit of sexual gratification. Roth has deliberately created a character with no redeeming qualities, and while I admire his skill at developing such a reprehensible human being, I didn't enjoy reading about Mickey Sabbath or the lives he destroyed. No matter how many disastrous situations Roth creates for Sabbath I found myself wanting this to end; the book became a chore to read. Sabbath is a pathetic antihero, not an epic one, and hardly worth Roth's efforts on his behalf."
2,The concept just didn't work for me,"This book is fairly well written (although not compared to Bellow or Nabakov or Self). However, there is an unforgivable flaw. Who can possibly write a meaningful novel about a lech of a man (a sailor who has had sex with how many prostitiues?) when the man has NEVER contracted an STD? Just blew the credibility of the whole thing for me. If this were more of an attempt at magical realism I guess I could have swallowed it, but this novel really struck me as trying to paint a somewhat realistic portrait...of trying to convince me (of something?). But prostitutes, unprotected sex, and tens of other partners without physical consequences (I suppose there seem to be spiritual consequences)? Sorry, Roth, I just couldn't believe it."
1,Never Again,"I have read Philip Roth before and have enjoyed his work. This particular book is unreadable and unworthy in my estimation.I bought the book on sale and obviously paid too much for it in my estimation.I did not enjoy the main character and did not enjoy the plot, what there was of it that I could find.I am happy that others seemed to enjoy the book much better than did. I know what it takes to write a book.Sorry, but I will be careful about selecting a future book of his to read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Mam, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Erotic, honest, irreverent","Morris ""Mickey"" Sabbath is an uncommon man. His whole life is uncommon. He made his living as a puppeteer. Only at the ripe age of 60 did he find his ideal woman, and she belonged to someone else. (The book explores the question Does anyone belong to anyone else?)Erotic, honest, irreverent.Does Mickey have a reason to stay alive when his lover dies, his wife wants a divorce, he doesn't have a job, arthritis has crippled him. Will he find a rope and kill himself? Or will he find a reason to stay alive?Comes across as a book written by a college lit. professor. Sentences run on in a call of attention to the fact that it is happening. Strangely done, but effective."
3,Interesting Movie,"This movie brought back memories of my adolescent years in Dublin Ireland. It has a relatively peculiar story line. However the scenery in Dublin and Howth is spectacular. Jared Leto an up and coming star at the time is great in the character he plays and the narration gives the movie good carry through. I can see aspects of the mother in the characters of Irish people I know but her personality is not really consistent with Irish women or indeed Irish viewpoints today. Catherine O'Hara does a good job with the role. I enjoyed the movie and may watch it again some Winter evening, as I sit by the fire in California and think of home. The movie was given a different title in its Irish release and was called ""The Last Of The High Kings."" which makes more sense in the storyline."
3,Sex and Clergy in Ireland.,"I watched this movie on DVD titled ""The Last of the High Kings""-and really missed a sense of a ""politically correct""-style alteration.A school-not-so-well-graduated-from Frankie waited a letter of acceptance at university, calculating days to the eventual post delivering, fooling around with other graduates, eccentric family and neighbors.Of course, young handsome inexperienced male is a very target for sexually advanced females-both local and visiting, of whom loss of virginity initiated imminently both rage of mother's jealousy and some ill-conceived mimicry on priest's ubiquity.Although young Leto is really good in this movie and at least three sequences- beach party, seduction of a virgin boy and boy's later description of this act - are really nice, Irish-British grass-roots affairs depicted briefly and long monologues leave a feeling of some boringness.In general, this movie broadened my existing info of Ireland."
1,A terrible waste of my time!,This movie was a terrible movie. It was so boring. I couldn't believe that it was such a dull movie. It looked so good on the cover. They had to get got actors to lessen the blow of this rather complicated film. It didn't even make sense. Christina Ricci's character shouldn't have been in there. She didn't do anything except embarrasse herself on the bus. The accents were the only good thing about it. They did a good job with that. Don't waste your time!!!
5,Full of laughs!,"If you haven't seen the final series of ""Home Improvement"" on television, you have to buy this video. It is once more full of fun and laughs and never-before-seen-bloopers. And finally, you'll see a lot of memories and for once Wilson's face!!!!!! Have fun watching it!"
2,JTT is missing!,I bought this video only because I am a big fan of Jonathan Taylor Thomas. To my dissapointment he`s not in this video at all!But Tim Allen is great -as always!
4,A Terrific Farewell,A great but tearjerking farewell for the cast of Home Improvement. The only thing that would have made it better is if all the cast (JTT) would have been there for the grand finale. A must buy for any serious or casual fan.
4,Home Improvement: Series Finale,Ok. This was a great show and I was sorry that it went off the air. If you like Tim Allen you will enjoy this. In time this will be a collectors item. Worth the money.
3,2.5 stars: Puff gets my vote for best bling and best flosser of alltime.,"Nobody stunts like Puff. Sorry Birdman. In 1999 BadBoy Records was still living off the success of No Way Out, Life After Death and Mase's Harlem World. So Puff steps to the plate again with Forever. The music is just okay and plays more like a compilation due to the large amount of guest stars. But like I said nobody stunts like Puff Daddy. Dude had the most diamonds and was banging Jennifer Lopez in her prime. Hell, he made JLo who she is today!Top Joints:Reverse (Shyne Po rips it)Journey Through The Life (Great posse cut where Nas and Beans kill the track)Is this the End? (Kinda Wierd Track That Works. Twista shines on it)PE 2000 (Stuntin)"
3,"Okay, but lacks oomph of the other two","Puff Daddy's second album was okay, but it lacks the oomph of the '97 album and the funky songs of the 2001 album. I recall the one where he samples the Luniz' I Got 5 on It for one song. But the album is a mixed bag, where some numbers sound too much like No Way Out's leftovers and some grooves sound too 1998 for a '99 release. 5 to 5 1/2 years later, there aren't a lot of memorable songs from this album."
4,"a much better effort than ""No Way Out""","On his follow up album to ""no Way Out"", Puff Daddy does a much better job with the beats on the most part, and his raps are a lot better than they were before. The guest appearences are all well done also. This is still not comparable to albums like Jay-Z's ""Volume 2..hard knock life"" or Nas's ""I Am"" but it is very decent, and it is worth the money."
2,This CD pretty much sucks.,"Puff Daddy tries to sound like a gangster. He is nothing of that sort. One of the best tracks, Satisfy You, copies the beat from I Got Five On It by the Luniz. He also copies Snoop Doggy Dogg a few times. Puff can be a good producer, but he's no gangster."
5,Great sophomore album from P.D.,This album is the greatest album out this year. It is an amazing follow up from Puff Daddy's last album.I love the cd and reccomend it to any rap lover out there.
1,Boring Stuff,"The CD, ""No Way Out"" is excellent. But, I can't say the same for PD's sophomore effort. PD has abandoned his old success formula and tried to venture into underground rap. The likes of DMX, Mobb Deep, Nas, etc, definitely sounds more convincing than PD. Although there are guest appearances from a number of famous hip-hop artists, they are far from their best.Riding on the success of ""No Way Out"" PD will definitely stay for quite some time in the hip-hop world. But, FOREVER? Maybe not.Hip-hop fans should give this album a miss (money is hard to earn, so don't waste it on such a weak effort)."
2,Everything is cool except Puffy's rapping.,"I have two beefs with this album: the first is that although the beats and the sampling and the general engineering of each songs is incredible... the problem with the album is that everything makes you bob your head until Puff starts rapping. It's awful. His rhythm, his lyrics, are all weak. My other beef is the tempo of the music. Almost all of the songs on Forever are pretty slow."
1,Don't buy it...,"...I'll tell the truth. I bought it the other day and listened to every track. Not liking one. So, the next day I gave it another shot and listened to it again. Hoping it would grow on me. It didn't. Puffy doesn't rhyme as well and the beats are horrible. It's as if he is trying to turn every song into song weird dance song. I don't know, maybe you will like it. I thought it was the worst CD ever. Not even one song I enjoyed. Stick to his ""No Way Out"" CD and artists such as NAS and Method Man. You'll be much happier..."
1,Says enough...2 bad I had to give it at least one star.,Says enough...2 bad I had to give it at least one star
1,It can't get much worse than this.,"It is getting harder and harder to find decent music these days. I was hoping to find a good hip hop CD for the end of summer and decided to sample the new Puff Daddy. It was a good decision on my part, I saved 16 bucks. This one is really bad. There are only two decent songs on the whole album. Better luck next time Puffy. Oh well, it doesn't really matter what I think, this album will still sell. A fair warning, sample before you buy."
1,two words: its hammertime,"Shame on you if you are considering buying this ablum. This album undeniably proves (if you had any doubts) that Puffy has no hip hop credentials. While still riding the coat tails of Biggy, this album shows no direction and is a sorry attempt to fool the money hungry youth into buying into his materialistic propoganda. Do yourself a favor, buy the Roots Come Alive album and keep a look out for the Antipop Consortium. What's next Puffy? Versace Pumps in the Bump?"
3,8TRACKS 10 TRASH,"MY TITLE EXPLAINS IT ALL. Some good stuffs and then very weak stuffs. I think puff diddy don't have to be in a hurry to make an album like this. It needed a lot of editing. Most of the trash in this album were just there to fill it up. Dr. Dre named his album Dr. Dre 2001 meaning it will last till the year 2001. Puffy named his FOEVER- no more like this, so don't expect something to be out very soon."
2,Terrible follow up,"This cd is not worthy of more than 5 dollars. compared to No way out this is garbage.only tracks such as Do you want it,Best friend,and is it the end are worthy of your ears.SO TIP DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!"
5,PUFF DADDY is the greatest rapper for all times!,"See, Puffy is the best rapper in the hip-hop and I think that his album is better than all other, and in his music he sings about passion, love and the life. So, people who don't like this album don't like the life. I LOVE PUFFY AND HIS MUSIC AND I'LL ALWAYS LOVE IT-FOREVER!"
2,PUFFY NEEDS TO GIVE IT UP,"the only thing about puff daddy's cd that i liked was the guest apperances if it wasnt 4 all the other real rappers on his cd i wouldn't have bought itpersonally i think puff daddy learned everything he knows from BIGGIE for example the way he bites off of other peoples styles, beats, and lyrics BIGGIE did the same thing he copied off 2pacs style SO MY OPINION TO YOU IS THAT IF YOU LIKE PUFFY'S STYLE THEN BUY HIS CD BUT IF YOU NEVER DID LIKE PUFFY THEN DONT UY IT!"
1,shiny suit syndrom,"True hiphop lives on the street of underground, not on MTV or Billboard... GET THAT, PUFF? WHILE THE ROOTS/MOS DEF/PHAROAHE MONCH ARE MAKING ORIGINAL UNDERGROUND HITS, YOU ARE PUSHING HIPHOP 10YRS BACK TO THE PAST..."
5,This is an awsome cd,this is the one of the best cds i have i have been listening to it all day you guys have to get this cd i mean there are so many people on this cd you can't go wrong this is a must have in yoru hip hop collection
2,Puff Sucks,"Altough this CD has been hyped, and is visually impressive, PD fails to keep it real. The beats are wack, and one would expect more from hip-hop's most visible figure...you $ is better spent buying something else..."
3,"dissapointing, very dissapointing","this album does not even come close to his first release, this is not what i expected it to be at all,theres a lot of whaked tracks with sorry beats"
5,Puffy's hitting the jack pot again,"This CD is DA BOMB!!! Who ever out there don't like this CD must have a bad taste of music. This is to who ever disses Puffy. At least Puffy is trying to work good at his singing carrier, and not giving up. If it was you and you read what some of you peoples wrote about him you would probaly give up singing so give a little faith in him and just write a good thing about him in your review. See Ya, April Sutton"
1,Public Enemy number one my @$$,"Puff Daddy's first album, no way out, turned out to be better than I expected so I decided to pick up his latest album, Forever, despite his whack single, PE 2000, where he claims he's public enemy number one. Bull sh!t. Fluffy dosen't scare anyone. His flaws in his rhyming skills are evident in this LP. He is too slow and can't quit talking about his bently. He is a good producer but its not enough to cover up his rhymes. He needs to leave the emcee-ing alone and stick to producing hits for others."
5,hes still ok,Well I CANT give him credit for copying my favorite song I got 5 on it!but I can give him credit for trying to do his best and for being fine!
1,PUFF DADDY IS A JOKE!,"Here's one for the two-triple-0! I didn't know this character back in '91 & i wish i didn't know him now! This album is seriously lacking in dope beats. This s**t is wack, man. Keep it real with some explosive west coast s**t."
1,HORRIBLE,"sean combs has not a talented bone in his body...he cannot rap, he cannot produce(look at the credits for life after death-you'll notice that not one song is produced solely by puff daddy...they are all produced by puff daddy and someone else)"
3,NOT A PUFFY FAN!,"But I am a fan of some of his past work with BIG and Jodice. Puffy is an entertainer, not a rapper or singer. you must remember that, then listen to his album. I think it is stright. I like the song's with Jay-Z, Bizzy Bone and the hater introludes. His first album was the sh.. but this album couldnt catch a audience."
4,Bad boy for life!,"I just want to say that all the haters of Bad boys and more specifically p.diddy please explain to me why?Hes the most respected man in the business and whether any of you like it or not he makes nothing but big hits. And for everyone that thinks Diddy made all his money from Biggie your just making exuses. Bad boy is worth approximately 500 million dollars and you think only B.I.G made all that money.Think again people hes been gone for 7 years now and their still making money.As for the album ""Forever"" It is a fairly good album however not a classic like ""No Way Out""was. Most of the tracks are hot and its a cd for everyone not just rap/hip-hop lovers"
1,Is There really a reason for this,"Was there really a good reason for Diddy to bring this garbage out?..........No There wasnt, he just did it because hes Diddy and he can do that. I have heard some bad album but DAMN, I never thought i would be sick to my stomach listening to this. Its horrible, the single Public Enemy 1 is horrendous, and Hurricane G is annoying as hell. The other single satisfy you was annoying also, its no wonder J.Lo left him. Diddy seriously needs to thing before he brings out another solo album cause this is garbage."
3,This CD is probably not worth buying,"The reason I give this CD 3 stars is because of all the guests on this CD. I don't think Puffy can rap at all, in fact I think he's really bad. I hated P.E. 2000, but actually didn't mind Staisfy You. The two best songs, in my opinion, are ""Is This The End (Part 2)"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" I like these songs because they have Twista and Bizzy Bone, who are both awesome. I recommend that you not buy this CD, unless you're crazy enough to think that Puffy can rap."
4,"Still the best producer in hip hop, but something is missing","The beats are tight as ever. The samples move you and make you remember the songs that were once rocked to with other words in your head. Hearing B.I.G. again flowing with Diddy gets you hyped. But something is missing....MA$E! It is strange to hear Puff and no MA$E...anywhere. Yeah, Puff is not the greatest rapper, and it shows with out at least one track with MA$E who always helps him sound better. Nice cd, not near as good as his last solo, but it is nice. One thing that it does do is get you ready to get that last B.I.G. cd that should be coming out in October from what Puffy said in an MTV interview."
5,"Thats that hit right there, who should he fear?","I was so hyped about this album. I knew this was going to be one of the best. When I finally bought it I was very dissapointed. I was expecting something really hot. But I was to blind to see it. After I listened through the cd. I was like this is really good, its got some good beats and some good ryhmes. Then the second time I listened to it, I'm like this is extremely good. A lot better than the first cd. And as much as you don't want to admit it(haters) his ryhmes are a lot better. Even though he does rap slow on some of the tracks, they are still good. Like Bad Boy said ""this is a cd that will go down in history"". And before you hate this cd, Listen threw it several times. You got to get use to it, its something new. Something hot. And if you think you shouldn't get this cd, u previewed it and are like this is going to be a waste. Watch the tv as music video after video comes out, and then you'll like it. Won't stop, can't stop. FOREVER."
5,"Good Work by Puff, Much Respect","A lot of hot tracks on this CD. He has many styles liek laid back and rapid fire which he shows on Forever. Even though he samples, SOMETIMES ALL YOU WANT IS A GOOD SOME. get what im sayin? puff is an artist man. BAD BOY TIL THE DAY WE DIE!!"
1,Garbage,"What a horrible album. Not one song on this garbage was good. Please get off of Biggi for a change and write some real lyrics ""Puff Garbage""."
4,Atleast respect him trying to be ORIGINAL this time around,"I trashed Puff with his first album left and right for being a total rip-off. I gave him a second chance with this new album. He is definitely being original this time around, and he has gained respect from me for that. It's not one of the year's best hip-hop records, but it is a good solid album. None of the songs are bad, but none of them are innovative enough to advance music as a whole. Puffy has the image down (very good-looking and well-dressed), and he is smart enough to get guest stars, and he is relying on the old-school tactic of self-glamourizing. Overall, it's worth buying."
1,Why waste your time and money????,"I like only one song ""satisf you"" and that's because I like the song ""I got five on it"". Should have just bought their's. They have more than just one nice song."
1,I didn't know this was the BLUFF DADDY!,"Come on Puff!! We already know you have a lot of money. So why do you keep wasting it on stupid sampling machines? I think just about every song I heard on this LP used some sampled old school beat. You aint foolin nobody man. Stick to producing, not rapping. I mean, you got some great artists on Bad Boy. 112 is hot, Black Rob is hot, Shyne is gonna be hot. You're doin enough already. Don't bother us with your pale attempts at rhyming. It aint worth my 17 bucks, ya heard?"
1,I will poop on his face when he gets to my cell block,"This album is the epitome of stupidity. I hate unoriginal artists that think they are inovating, but rather tarnishing the face of real hip-hop."
2,a two-timin' bumpin' outing,"Listen, if you guys really wanna rock the dope beats, listen to this: Puff Daddy has released a rare group of new songs. The name of the album is ""Magical Heart-Attack: by Sean Combs"". It's all about him melting. Plus, dope cover art!"
1,FUELED BY THE PRE-TEEN SUBURBOBRAT,"This is a weaker version of one of those NOW CDs. Hasnt he made enough money from BIG, cant he stop even after the man is dead. When will people stop buying this. Who buys this. I think its the 12 year old suburban brat who runs to mommy, crying ""give me more money and have the made drive me to the mall, unless i get a shiny jacket, a fubu shirt, and the new Puff Daddy CD, the kids in my private school wont think Im cool"""
1,Puffy needs to retire,"This is one of the wackest albums I've ever heard. The only song that's worth listening to is Satisfy You but the beat is old(and it sounded better on I Got 5 On It by the Luniz). Puffy's cds are full of tired beats and sorry lyrics. I think he needs to stick to just producing. Don't buy this cd, it's a waste of money."
1,puffy has no talent,"he keeps on stealing other artist's lyrics and beats... not mentioning that he capitalizes on biggie's death... with that song called ""I'll be capitalizing on you"""
1,garbage.....,"why in the world is this guy still making records. i gave him one star because it wouldn't let me leave it blank. i have never once bought a puff album and never plan too, but you still hear him all the time....this is garbage and a perfect example of what commercial b.s. is."
1,Save Your Money!,Puffy is the world's biggest sellout who never had any talent 2 begin with! Anyone who buys this needs their head examined!
2,WEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Someone please tell Puff to stick with producing another artist's albums and leave rapping to the real MCs. What's up with all the sampling? At first I thought I pop the wrong cd in because when comes on it sounds like my boy 2Pac ""Me Agaisnt The World"" album. What's with that. It makes everything 2Pac said about this playa true. He wouldn't tried if Pac was still around. The only 2 good tracks ""Satisfy You"" in which R.Kelly saves and ""Real Niggas"". If ya haven't gotten this album yet don't get it! Its not worth it. Oh, the 2 stars is for my boy B.I.G R.I.P man."
2,"DO YOU LIKE IT....DO YOU WANT,IS THA BEST CUT THAT I LIKED FROM THIS !!!",P...WHAT WAS YOU THINKING?????
5,"VERY TALENTED, SHARP DRESSING PRODUCER","SINCE THE NO WAY OUT LP I WAS INTERESTED IN THE NEXT LP. HIS STYLE IS VERY SUAVE AND PROFESSIONAL. FOREVER (SOPHOMORE LP) IS THE NEXT LEVEL OF THE WAY HE REACHES OUT TO HIS LISTENERS. SEAN IS ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY, DRESSING IN LAVISH MATERIALS, AND HELPING OUT HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I WENT TO HIS FAMILY TOUR IN ARIZONA LAST YEAR (WHERE I LIVE) AND IT WAS WELL PUT! I ENVY THE STYLE AND ATTITUDE OF PUFF AND HOPE TO MEET HIM OR JUST TO SPEAK TO HIM BEFORE JESUS COMES BACK. MY NAME IS JUSTIN JUST LIKE HIS SONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK."
2,It is not that good.,"This CD is OK, but it has nothing compered to a 2pac CD. 2PAC will always be the greatest ever. Rest In Peace 2pac, you will never be forgotten."
1,A failure.....a miserable failure.,"What do you mean, ""Forever""? Huh, Puffy? I hear you've been on trial. Anyway, this is no excuse. A curse upon us all! I'd rather be listening to cats fight. Stevie Wonder rules forever!"
2,"Hmmmm, I have mixed feelings about this CD","People must understand, that it doesn't matter that Puff Daddy ripped most of his beats, thats called Sampling, many rappers do that. But, the #1 rule of sampling is to sample something with GOOD beats. I mean, some (as in 3 or 4) of the songs on this CD have good beats. The lyrics are pretty poor, and the way the CD was done, it seems like this CD was horribly rushed. Puff Daddy is not the same rapper, this CD is a sick combonation of Weak Rap, R&B, and Pop. Puffy, we expected more hardcore. But, I guess we can't kill him, every rapper has one CD that they wish never happened. This CD only sells off Puff's popularity. Even someone REMOTELY interested in rap would find this CD bad. This is like a God dedication album. Very gospel type beats and lyrics. Let me sum it up, this Album SUX, it has slow beats, bad lyrics, and the Guest Stars don't do too much to help the album. DONT BUY THIS ALBUM, GO BY REAL RAP, LIKE DA WU-TANG CLAN"
1,If I could give it minus stars I would...,Tuffdaddy has never been about the music. BIG had the skills and honeycombs can sell a record but when he started to rap on BIG's albums my interest waned.
1,Its A Disaster!,"I liked Puffy's first album so I thought I would give this one a try. This album is terrible. Puffy needs to come up with some original music and better lyrics. He can't rap, and he has no passion behind his words. If you're looking for some good music, head over to the 2Pac section."
1,i hate commercialized rap!,Puffy's nothing compared to the Last Emperor! 'Secret Wars' is one of the greatest cuts on vinyl!
1,"If it was an option, it deserves a --5 star...","As usual, Mr. Puffy has no talent at all. Most of his tracks, if not all, has other recording artist(s)singing with, or for him. If it weren't for them, he certainly would be nothing. In fact, there is not one major hit that he came up with, all on his own, to prove that he has some sort of singing talent. Majority of them are old school remix, that the younger generation never heard of, and thinks that he was the original singer.. Mr. Puffy needs a new line of work, bcuz he certainly would amount to nothing without the talents of all the other recording artist(s)helping him out.."
5,Playa why you hatin'?,No one is worse at sampling than No Limit. At least Puff does'nt sample current songs. Bad Boy Forever.Also check Lil Cease album .
2,Sophmore Jinx,"Unlike a lot of you Johnny Come Lately's who feel hip hop started with Snoop Dog (this could be the only reason I'd see someone giving this a 5 stars)I'm a hip hop vet and let me say this; when your garbage it always comes to surface.Puff knows he's not about s*** when it come to rapping but what with this attitude now? Come on! I mean this guy is rapping with the attitude like he's Ra, Slick Rick or KRS. What makes this project so bad is that he's still relying on samples to carry him. Yes, yes, yes, we know everyone samples but there's a big difference when say a DJ Premier samples something and crafts it into a work of art as opposed to Puffy being Mr Jackin for Beats.Now, Puffy lovers out there I'll ask a question like I said with his first realease. BTW this is what I hate about hip hop now but heres the question, if this album had no guest appearances on it, would it still be able to hold anything? Would you buy a Puffy joint with him on it?I think not. BTW the album is boring!"
2,Big fan but...,"I'm a big puff fan, but this CD is truly mediocre. Only 3 (4 if you like religious songs) are good. But that is 3 or 4 out of 19 tracks. If you are a true PD fan you should get it anyways, but i was certainly disapointed by the CD. His last CD was one of the best rap albums I have ever heard, and he defenitely could not follow his own act."
2,Does PD ever make his own beats?,"After listening to the album, I was horrified. Is this hip hop? No it's not. Weak beats from an even weaker rapper. Stop stealing other rapper's beats! I was thoroughly insulted when I heard Satisfy you. It was I got 5 on it with a dumb rap. Be original Puff!"
1,A sheer disappointment,"Sadly, this album is a disappointment. After a long wait for the new Puff Daddy album, us fans were taken aback at the lack of quality shown in this album. The songs are completely uncreative and egoistic, Puff Daddy pawning himself off as the world's number one enemy with some annoying voice in the background telling him how great he is and how he's number one. Guest stars featured might add a touch of inspiration to the album, but overall, this album is a flop and a disapointment. Public Enemy number 1? I don't think so. No one wants to take you Puffy, no one thinks of you as a public enemy; most people idolize you. Sorry, but you could do better Puff."
1,"This is the least creative ""production"" i have ever heard.",This is in not Hip-Hop music. All his production is a loop of someone else's track. its is the least creative i have ever heard. it is a poor excuse for music and i appologise to the people who bought the cd.
1,should have read small print,I guess the DVD is in good shape? Would not know becasue its made for a German DVD player. Am in the process of returning it
1,Horrible,My tape i went to put it in my vhs and it wont work the tape player just ejects the movie. I hae tons of other vhs that work just fine.
1,Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas,This DV does not work. It hasn'tworked since I received it. I am not at all happy.
1,"Cheating,customers.","Since, The Walt,Disney,VHS, tapes,Have been sold,to the puplic,customers, Have been getting! cheated.You the seller, dont give enough, information, on the tape, Example, their, Disney,Classics, Masterpeices, Disney,Gold collection.,and others, I ask for A Disney,Gold,Their are two tapes, of the same movie,made. When you sell, a gold, It sould say Gold collection, on cover. you sould tell the customer,more information.You Display, picturesque,on the Internet, And send what is not of the picturesque.sell,me what I see! For that is what im buying."
2,Region 2 DVD,This DVD won't play in American DVD players; it will only play in players set for Region 2 (United Kingdom). It will play on our computer if we change the region setting.
4,Good Movie for my son,"We bought twice upon a christmas first... then we got once upon a christmas. The animation of this one was a bit older, but definitely still enjoyable"
2,Gives the idea there is no Santa....,"Why would Disney think it is ok to give the idea there is no Santa. Gives a 7 year old the idea maybe there isn't after all, who was watching the movie with her 4 year old sister. I frankly was mortified. I tried to turn it off, but they insisted to continue. True magically wonder lasts for such a short time in a lifetime, why even try to cut it short? It's short enough as it is."
2,Substandard Disney's,"Disney's standard is getting lower and lower in recent years. The quality of the drawings is good only for the first few minutes. This cheaply made cartoon is only good enough for Saturday Monring showing, not a worthwhile DVD collection."
3,Disappointing,"Parts of the DVD are good, parts are unnecessarily repetitious so length can be added. The graphics quality is strangely uneven--as if it were done by two different teams of animators--and the storyline lacks the creativity Disney characters usually have. It ""Christmasy"" enough, and that's a good thing, but it's not remotely close to the cartoons of the past...though I guess nothing is."
3,Pretty disappointing...,"I LOVE Christmas movies, and Disney made some of the best ones in the past ""Pluto's Christmas Tree,"" ""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" ""Toy Tinkers,"" ""Donald's Snow Fight"" and many more and I was hoping this DVD would be similar to those but I was disappointed. There are 3 shorts on this DVD. I liked the sequel to this movie much better called Twice Upon A Christmas."
2,Thanks Disney for putting doubt in my child's head about Santa,This movie is cute however i only gave it 3 stars for the goofy story. My child just turned 5 and now he has all these questions about santa since all the christmas movies put the idea of Santa not being real before it turns out that he is. Even though it always proves Santa to be real why instore that he isn't in the first place. He's pretty smart and when he hear's on the goofy bit them saying that it is impossible for santa to travel around the world in one night and that he's a myth he understands that. That sounds a lot more real than what we tell them.
3,Umm,"Umm hello don't listen to them people who gave a few bad remarks about this movie.After all it was made for kids,not adults! Let the kids be the judge if they like it or not!"
4,A journal of my six month tour in Somalia during 1993-94.,This is a day by day journal of my time in Somalia. I was there as an Army medic with the 24th Infantry Division and spent my tour working with a multitude of different units. These ranged from the military police to special operations. My attempt was to give the average person an idea of what it is like to be deployed and to work as an Army medic in the present day. Currently I am employed as a Physician Assistant and was trained through the Army program.
4,A young soldier's journal,"Mark Rausenberger's personal journal of his six-month tour of duty in Somalia was an interesting and provocative read. His eye opening account, although peppered with sarcasm, gave the reader a glimpse of a spirited young man, who willingly served his country. Bravery in the face of adversity is admirable and it is likely that Rausenberger's strength and sense of humor benefited his fellow soldiers."
5,nearest thing to a miracle,"I have suffered for almost 30 years with sinus infections brought on by allergies year round. Antibiotics were killing my system and really not working all that well recently. I was developing a sinus infection a few months ago and took the 2-week round of Bio-Defender and the congestion, pressure and infection went away. A couple of weeks ago, I was pretty sick with a low-grade fever and terrible sinus pressure. I began taking a doctor-prescribed antibiotic which was making me itch. So I went to Bio-Defender again, and the pressure in my face was gone after two days and I am beginning to get well AGAIN. So I plan on keeping this around and making good use of it. It really works for me. It's really a Godsend."
3,Good advice if you haven't already heard it.,"I'm not a kid, but I was disappointed enough in this book to write this anonymous review (my first).This book is short (~ 9 pages). That in itself isn't bad; neither is the advice in the book. But it's the kind of prosaic advice that belongs on a free web page, not in an e-book. I've bought many paper books over the years and four e-books in the last week, and this is the first item in either category that I would return if I could. I was disappointed enough in this book to write this review (my first). I much preferred Seth Godin's _Bootstrapper's Bible_."
4,Great Activity Book for Summer,A ton of great ideas. Some very simplistic but I purchased the book when my son was 3. A 2 year old would find the simple activities enjoyable. We like stone painting and butter balls. Worth the investment for sure!
2,Unimpressed. Nothing too novel,"I was looking forward to this book after purchasing a simiar one. The vast majority of the suggestings are well... uncreative. Examples: Get popcorn, a blanket, and watch a movie. Make a pillow fort in the living room. Plant seeds in a garden.A much better option IMO is ""The Preschooler's Busy Book"""
4,Skews young...but still some fun stuff,"This isn't a book for those who'd rather park their kids in front of the television or who wish to send their kids off to do something else. It's hands-on, preferably adult and child, and tends to be for younger children. But if you're that kind of parent--and here's hoping you are--prepare to have a blast with your younger child. Kid art gives this book a fun look and feel, too."
2,Creative Play,This book was not quite what I expected. There are some good ideas and some truly idiotic ones as well. I'm not sure if the good outweighs the bad.
4,What a great idea!,I've bought this book a few weeks ago and I was facscinated by the facts that I read from ordinary Arab citizens. As an American it made me change the way I view Arabs (Muslims and Christians) in the Middle East and it also made me understand more about our foreign policy and Middle East politics.
2,Universal PDA mount w/ Power Adapter,"The cradle for the PDA works just fine as it should being a rather generic and simple design. However, being that the mount is simply plugged into the lighter socket makes it a rather poor design because the mounting arm is long and not stable. It is an accident waiting to happen in terms of knocking the mount over or damaging the lighter socket. Forget this mount and get something more practical and durable; suction cup, vent, or dash mount."
4,GPS Mount,"This is a nice little mount that attaches to the powered outlet in the car. It takes some adjusting to get it setup initially. But, it works as advertised."
2,arrived with dead battery,"Cheap, but arrived with a dead battery and as I was leaving the country and the next day did not return to Amazon. Did stop by a JC Penney and get a new battery for 10.00, doubling the price of the watch.Cheap but not cheerful."
5,Nice watch,"This is like a disposable watch. I mean use it for 1-2 years and it is worth it. Now a days, using watch is almost like a special occasion thing. People use only cell phones, it is nice to have a real watch and have a reliable source. This watch has been reliable and good."
2,Painting in the primitive style,The book was not as stated. The over was faded and some of the pages were scribbed on. I would have rated this book as fair when it was listed on the used section.
1,Awful version of the Meditations,"Here is what Gregory Hays, this translator, wrote:1. MY GRANDFATHER VERSUS. Character and self-control.This is choppy. These are sentence fragments.Here is how Maxwell Staniforth translated the same passage in theMeditations:1. Courtesy and serenity of temper I first learnt to know from my grandfather Versus.Heres another verse from Hays:2. MY FATHER (FROM MY OWN MEMORIES AND HIS REPUTATION). Integrity and manliness.From Staniforth:2. Manliness without ostentation I learnt from what I have heard and remember of my father.Heaven forbid you let a young person read the sentence fragments from Hays. Fortune cookies are more eloquent than Hays."
1,No chime...,"Was given this as a gift last year... It has a small spinning device near the top, but it has never spun and does not chime... but it looks nice, at least."
4,Beautiful Suncatcher/Poor wind chime,"This is a awesome looking sun catcher, it casts some really pretty different colors into my front windows, however the claim of it being a wind chime leaves something out.The windchimes, actually sound like cheap metal claning together. It's not the relaxing sounds I have come to expect from chimes, but the beauty of it makes up for that"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,I thought this was a PAPERBACK BOOK. It's a NOTEPAD! I wouldn't have paid $3.40 for a 4x5 inch NOTEPAD!I'm really disgusted with this.~Sherri
2,Their worst album,This album is by far their worst album. Its not rap / metal is just rap and some times rap /metal. Stay on their previous albums and especially Born dead and Violent Demise.
3,Not as good as their older albums,"I love Body Count. These guys aren't some novelty band; they're the real deal. Unfortunately, Murder 4 Hire doesn't hold up to their previous albums. I'm not saying it's bad, because it's not. Most of the song writing is excellent, but it lacks in other areas (i.e. ""Relationships""). I still recommend you buy the album though. Body Count needs its fans' support more than ever!"
4,Early Fusion at its Best,"Though not the Gil Evans album to start with (that would be ""Out of the Cool""), ""Blues in Orbit"" is a fascinating transition between Gil Evan's earlier acoustic classics to his not so amazing fusion period, while still in keeping with his progressive hard bop meets big band sound. ""Blues in Orbit"" has a few songs (such as the opening track) that sound relatively conventional while others (such as the title track)are fusion with aspects of free jazz. Gil Evans was obviously keeping up with the times (remember that he was going to collaborate with Jimi Hendrix and when that didn't materialize, recorded an entire album of his compositions) and though he didn't compose much or tour much at the time (that would change) ""Blues in Orbit"" sounds more vital, raw and energetic than most of 70's fusion (except for Miles of course) would even approach."
2,Genuine transgressive TV--or not?,"I really wanted to like this series, I really did, but found a lot of it about as revolutionary or paradigm-shattering as a Berkeley potluck.There's a few good bits--Robert Anton Wilson, Kenneth Anger, Orridge--but CIA-programmed sex slaves, spotty teenage satanists, LA fetish balls...sigh. The kids in LA must really be bored, is all I can say.I'm not underestimating the effort it takes to create a TV series, but the potential for this series was huge. All they had to do was re-create their books, which are pretty good.I've seen more revolutionary stuff on SBS in Australia!"
2,Very Mixed Bag,"I was very disapointed with this DVD set. I'd never seen the show, but I'd bought the companion book of interviews over a year ago and really enjoyed it. Sadly, I found most of the episodes of the TV series to be silly and boring - a deadly combination. I do have to say that the Robot Sex sculpture/animation segment was brilliant though, and almost worth renting the whole set. If not for the second disk with videotape from the Disinfocon speakers, this whole set would be a waste. Even these are a mixed bag, but there are some cool pieces in there. Especially Grant Morrison's speach on Chaos Magic. My advice would be to rent it if you must see it or, I'll sell you my copy..."
1,Not an Alternative 60 Minutes,"I bought this expecting news stories on par with the books--with the occasional interview (as in the books).It's not. It is a farce, sensationalism over fact.I don't recommend this for serious disinfo fans.However, I do agree with Stealth Kitten. There are few interesting stories (She highlights most of them)."
1,Big disappointment,"I loved reading all the Disinformation books; assumed the TV program would be similar. Instead of great investigative reporting, the programming is more along the lines of visual National Enquirer. Huge disappointment... save your money for the next Disinfo book."
1,NOT What I expected,"If you are familiar with the DisInfo series of books then you may misjudge what this DVD is about. It is basically a series of 1/2 hour shows that only played in Britain, then was canceled even there. The cancellation had nothing to do with banning provocative content. There is no provocative content. Instead we are treated to a freakshow-like parade of unfortunates from off the street and elsewhere. This DVD is horrible."
4,Baseball has a new legend!,"I thought this book was quite wonderful and I enjoyed it greatly. I have never been a baseball fan, but I found myself completely involved with each characture. I would recommend this book to all of my friends!"
5,Proud,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It kept me on my seat through the whole book. Once I started reading it I could not put it down, all the suprising twists were great and it made me think. I never really liked baseball all that much, but I thought it was great. I am so proud of the author and his ability to keep me thinking. That is something I look for in books and it is so hard to find. Keep writing Mr.Orszula and I will keep reading."
5,WONDERFUL!,This dress was the centerpiece to my picture-perfect prom! I got a lot of positive responses from my classmates and I felt like a fairy princess! The measurements were perfect and it was not itchy at all like most dresses made with mesh. The price is unbeatable!!! I LOVE THIS DRESS!!!
5,Unique wedding dress,I found this dress while looking for some for a photo shoot. I fell in love with it. It was the perfect dress for my wedding. It arrived very quickly and fit fabulously. I love it and would order from them again.
4,The Dress is Beautiful,The dress is wonderful and my daughter will be wearing tomorrow night for the school's Homecoming dance. It was priced just right and we are thrilled it came so quickly. Thanks!
5,My Ideal Little Black Dress,"I love this dress! I've been eying it for the longest time and now I have it! So its a little formal?! I don't care! Its my ideal little black dress! It fits perfectly and I can't wait to wear it for my best friend's wedding! Also, I was so impressed with how quickly it arrived! I wasn't expecting it for at least a week and a half after I ordered it and it came within 5 days!"
4,mission,"Awesome! A wonderful and uplifting song for all ages. Surely, to bring the listeners back to their youth and successes in life. A song that every young people's choir should sing."
1,not very accurate,My mother-in-law has this unit. I did the test at her home and received a total of 169. The next day I did a lab test and got a reading of 205. I am sure the lab test was correct. 36 points is to much of a difference to me.
3,hard to get test strips only for more than a few days,It's OK. Not of any use to me needed a Multi Panel Tester for Volunteer work. Wanting to help Firefighters with a Free Wellness Program.
1,Thi is suck company and suck item,"This company is thief i think they sale use stuf for new, cheap s.Do not waist money and time plz, to buy enything here."
3,"Brody's ""Guitar Picker's Fakebook""","It is captious to complain about the ""arbitrariness"" of this or that form of tablature, or indeed of its ""difficulty."" ALL versions of tablature are arbitrary, and there is no real consensus as to which version is particularly preferable. SO: spend a little time getting familiar with the tablature being used in the present text, and then work your way through a few tunes using its tablature rather than wishing another tab was being used. After doing this, the Brody book becomes a pretty fair offering to the player with at least a little previous experience. It's not great, but taken for what it is, it has some great tunes, in relatively eassy to use arrangements for the early-intermediate player."
4,Enjoyable read,"I am reading this with my daughter and we are both enjoying it. Humorous book, well written for around the 7 - 10 year old ages. Also goo value as a 5-book collection like this."
5,I am in just as much suspense as my 7 year old to get to the next chapter!!,"I bought this box set because of readers reviews & I could not be more happy. My son follows me around the house and has asked me at 7am to read more Captain Underpants, how can I say no... he loves it and we love it too. The author does a great job presenting the stories in a way kids and parents will love. I am waiting to see an ACME product in the book to along with the PATSY 2000, 3-D imaging machine.THIS IS A MUST HAVE SERIES FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS!!!! I am buying the next set now."
1,poor binding captain underpants books,"My grandson really loves these books. As soon as they arrive he dives right into them.My complaint is the poor binding of these books. They literally fell apart after the firstreading. This is a shame because he would read them again, but hardly worth the effortto put them back together. I am considering not purchasing any more but waiting fortheir availability at the public library. ricbar2"
1,is this really what you want your kid to be reading?,"Ultimately the problem with Captain Underpants is that the protagonists, Harold and George, have zero redeeming qualities. Virtually every joke is at the expense of someone else--a really nice thing to encourage in young people (sarcasm). We made it through the first three books and I just couldn't take it anymore. Bully for Dav Pilkey for hitting his payday, but this dad think Captain Underpants stinks!"
2,Don't get these for kids learning to read!,"If you're thinking of getting these for your kindergarten, 1st or 2nd grade children I would suggest you pass on these books.In the captian underpants books are ""comic books"" drawn and written by two of the characters in the story. Pilkey, trying to be cute, has the kids constantly misspelling words in their comic books. My son, just learning to read and who loves these books, has a hard time understanding why someone would purposely misspell words. A number of times while practicing for spelling tests he has had words on his list that have been in the books and has asked if it's okay to spell his words the same way they do in the captain underpants books.It's nice that Pilkey can create a lucrative business based on potty humor and his inability to draw above a 3rd grade level but for those children learning how to read and write these books can be detrimental."
4,Grandson loves them,My grandson loved these books(and wants more). I'm a teacher and anything to get kids to read is fine by me:)!
4,"Kid's love it, but lots of potty talk","My 7 year old will sit and read these, laughing to himself, for an hour or more. He loves the series. The only downside is the potty talk that the book encourages. I guess the up-side is that the potty talk around the house has gotten more creative."
1,Too many misspellings.,"My 6 year-old son asked me to buy this book. He heard about it in school. He's in first grade, but reads very well. I don't think this book is appropriate for children. I don't like the jokes and there are too many misspellings. I am not going to buy another one of this for him. There are a lot of people who cannot write correctly and this is one of the reasons why. If my son keeps reading it, he's not going to learn how to spell and just bullshit is going to come out of his mouth. Not educational at all!! I hated it!!"
1,Took forever,I'm very unhappy with the service it took 30 days to receive and arrived in very bad condition. Christmas was ruined.
2,Not that great,"After two or three of these books, the plot becomes dull and loses its humor. Also, I would not recommend these for children learning to read and write as they are filled with misspellings (picher for picture and shurely for surely). I don't quite get why this is supposed to be funny, but it's confusing and ultimately detrimental for my 8 year old.Finally, parents take note: Pilkey has created a lucrative business based on potty humor and his inability to draw above a 3rd grade level. This is the junk food of the children's book industry. Many young children will find these books funny, but just as we don't allow our kids to eat candy and chips all day, these books should be limited."
5,These books are laugh-out-loud funny!,"George Beard and Harold Hutchins have a little problem; they just can't help being themselves. And being themselves means pulling pranks at school, writing comic books that make fun of authority figures, and changing the lunch menu marquee to make rude comments.Captain Underpants is a super-hero they made up in one of their comic books. Through a series of so-ridiculous-no-one-could-believe-it events, their school principal BECOMES Captain Underpants, and it's up to these two class clowns to make sure CU doesn't endanger himself. Incredibly bad puns abound. Each book has a copy of one of the boys' ""Treehouse Comics."" And there are plenty of gross jokes that grade-school kids love.This is the sort of book that will get kids to read even if they otherwise hate reading. Enjoy!"
5,Great Price And My Nephew Loved It,My sister's boy loved this collection. It was a very good price for getting 5 books. They sell this for 5X the price at the book fair at the school.
3,adult humor,i am not sure i would want to read this to children because it teaches making fun of authority. but for parents who have to deal with teachers and principals - i think this is hilarious! i always find humor books are funniest with a glass of wine and a friend.
4,"great series, but badly sold, since the sets overlap.","This is a terrific series, and my 6 year old loves them. I would have given them five stars, but deducted one star for the way they are packaged. Since we liked the first series (books 1 to 5), I went to buy the next boxed set, and found it was Books 5 through 8 - in other words, if you buy the first and second series, you end up with TWO copies of Book 5. It would have been obviously better to have series two starting with book 6. I am a bit grumpy about having to pay for an extra book we don't need."
4,My son is all over them,"My son is devouring them and, in doing so, is pushing himself to read more.The cartoon sections are deliberately laden with grammatical errors - they are supposed to be written by our two mischievous schoolboy heros - and the humor, while genuinely funny, is puerile. But hey! It's targeted at little boys. What do you expect?Very worthwhile purchase."
2,Was hopeful and was let down,"This book held so much potential in my eyes. I am not a feminist but I was very interested in the rights of Afghani women in post-Taliban Afghanistan. I found that this book was not the book for me. The author quoted a favorite author of mine (Ahmed Rashid) quite a bit but she seemed to almost be ""misquoting"" him. That was sad. He is an excellent source. Read ""Taliban"" if you would like a good history of the Taliban up 2000 AD. But beyond this, the author's bias was so incredibly thick, it was hard to wade through this book. What could have been picked out of this text as informational was drug down by her bias."
1,Too rough on the US occupation and way too gentle on Bin Laden,"Author Jones also seems to have a nostalgia for the old Soviet occupation of Afghanistan too as she discusses how the Soviets built apartment buildings there but that the US is charging the aghans much too high a rent rates now. Wll, Jones that's democracy--the right to charge what you wish to charge rather than a communist state (like the Soviet Union) where the government decided everything."
5,I can't put this book down.,Ann Jones takes up the human side of the war in Afghanistan. She deftly intertwines history with her own experience teaching English in Kabul and writes a book that is both gripping and profoundly moving. It also tackles the vexing issue of humanitarian aid and why sometimes our best efforts don't succeed. Winter in Kabul is a brave book.
4,Fascinating memoir of an opinionated woman,"A bit of a slog, but an interesting read, particularly for those hoping to get a better sense of the logistical and cultural challenges facing the reconstruction process in Afghanistan. Jones definitely has her biases: number 1 is against the US military; almost everything she says about them is exaggerated or wrong. Enemy number 2 is the rest of the US government, which she pretty much condemns as well. After a while, I got a bit tired of her self-righteousness. (I too have spent time in Afghanistan and have seen more than the one side of the coin she describes here) When she puts her biases aside and just shares her experiences instead of her theories about how we screwed up, the book really shines."
2,An expensive advertisement,"I found this little 9-page pamphlet to be little more than an expensive advertisement for the company Transformata Publishing LLC. I enjoyed ""The Story of Janet"" section, but found all the other information to be just plain common sense. I read it once and added it to the recycle bin."
