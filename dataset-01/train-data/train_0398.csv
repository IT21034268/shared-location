3,too big,"purchased for my son for christmas, band teacher at school said they were too big for the snare drums so had to purchase a different size. I didnt realize there were different sizes,and weights, now I know"
2,DON'T BUY If you're looking for a type specimen book,"This book may have many samples of typefaces but it does not have all alphabet. Some typefaces only have four letters. And all of them have no punctuations.If you're looking for a type specimen book, try Adobe Type Library Reference Book (ISBN: 0321136462) instead! Though it shows only one size (about 20pt,) and Adobe's only, it has everything in that set."
1,What Happen Panasonic?,Look I just got this player yesterday I had High expectations for it but sadly this thing sucks. I got this to replace my ageing Panasonic Shockwave SL-SW860 witch is a Great player I just wanted to update to something that had MP3 support.O.k. There are some good points:FM/AM works Great it picks up stations better than my car RadioMP3s Work great on it except for the pause between songsThe sound Quality is ok Not as good as the SL-sw860You can not make this thing skip same with My old oneCons:So very quiet I want to crank it up when I am on the bus so I cant hear other people talkingIts very cheaply Built and the lid will snap down on you when you try and change a CDBulky very bulkyHeadphones suck Horribly the same ones were packed with my old SWI am going to return this crap it isn't worth the $84 maybe $49 but that's the Highest. Ill stick with my old SW till I find a better player.
1,A Clunky Dud,"Recently returned this stinker to Radio Shack (hate shopping there -- their prices are the worst -- but I was eager to get my hands on a new player).Cons:1) Sound quality is lousy, muffled yet tinny, as if there's too much bass and yet not enough bass -- and turning on the extra bass doesn't do much except make it sound a bit more muffled. Sound quality failed to get better after switching headphones (three different pairs).2) Headphones that come with this unit are horrible. Sound is mediocre and the hard plastic earpieces become excruciatingly painful after just a couple of songs.2) Unit is on the heavy side; design is clunky and top heavy (easily slams itself shut if you don't keep it propped open when changing/inserting CDs.Pros:1) For another [money amount] you can do what I did and buy a significantly better product with more features (the Samsung CD Yepp' - MP3-CD Player -- sleek, sounds great, easy to use)."
5,Perfect!,The item was received fast and it for the price it has a lot of quality. I love that I can put him in any position I want. Its a lot of fun!
1,Misrepresentation of size,"This figure is nowhere near 6"" tall. It is about the size of a GI Joe. It is far too overpriced for the quality. If you order it and decide to return it, the shipper will not refund shipping at all. I learned this the hard way. You will NOT be refunded shipping and you have to ship it yourself so you pay for shipping twice.Do not bother ordering this figure unless you want something very minuscule to put on display."
5,TRANSFORMERS!!!,For those who love Transformers from the 80's this and optimus prime are excellent choices. It brings back memories but also the joy of seeing these characters in this capacity. ENJOY!!!
5,great for decoration,"not for playing this is for decorating and it is awesome, good and quite strong material, i thought it was very delicate but it's not. If you like the old transformers version it's a must have."
3,Good Story,"I really enjoyed this book. I disagree strongly with the opinions in the published editorial review--I'm glad I read the book despite the editorial review's somewhat defensive negativity, because had I skipped it, I would have missed a very good read.The story is very different from your typical young adult book--it is set in 1999/2000, with the heroine moving from Europe to rural New Jersey after the death of her grandmother. As she makes new friends and adapts to her new home, she learns to come to peace with herself, her family history and the death of loved ones. Along the way, she discovers that she can see the ghost of a Native American ancestor, and ultimately is able to help him find the peace that has eluded him over the years. I found the book to be interesting and somewhat thought provoking, with a very real view of family relationships. Enjoy!"
4,Carnival 2013,This product definitely did its job on Carnival Tuesday in Trinidad and Tobago for carnival 2013. I forgot to use it and got burnt the day before so on Tuesday it made all the difference. I got the tan without the burn :)
3,Goods and bads,I like it for that fact that it's easy to put on. Spray is very convenient. The bad is you look so shiny. Looks like you've been laminated with a layer or glass.
4,An Excellent Introduction to the Civil War for Children.,"""The Battle of Gettysburg"" is a book crammed with photographs and details of one of the Civil War's bloodiest frays. Neil Johnson attended the 125th reenactment of this grand battle and caught nearly all of the sights that make this single site so compelling. The text touches greatly on the historical aspects of the battle but also discusses the reenactment and the people who are so compelled to do military reenactment for a Hobby. This book is for children but adults who like a good picture book won't mind this one. It is a worthy book for any budding history buff's bookcase."
3,"love the pattern, not the design","A huge fan of Villeroy & Boch, certainly the best quality china out there... however, I am not sold on the design of these mugs. Short and stout, they look cool, but the purely aesthetic design allows more air into the cup at a faster rate than if they were taller and thinner, keeping the mug's contents warmer longer. If you gulp your coffee, you won't mind this at all. However, if you savor your cup while reading, chatting, or taking your time eating, you may find a luke-warm coffee in your cup..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought the Chocolate Factory for my daughter for her birthday, and I am very disappointed in it. It is very cheaply made. The double boiler is tiny and the edges are rough. The molds are very flimsy. If you need to move a mold after filling it, be sure to place it on a cookie sheet before filling it. The ladle was already broken when we opened the box."
2,"Great illustrations, but the story doesn't have good rhythm","My 16 month old daughter loves bugs and lift-the-flap books, so of course I thought that this would be a good combination. The illustrations are great, and the flaps are big and easy for a toddler to lift. But the story itself lacks a good rhythm: it doesn't rhyme, it doesn't flow well, it's not a lot of fun to read, unfortunately. My recommendation is to pass on by this book, unless you just want it for the illustrations."
5,"The ""bible"" of Russian(and former Soviet) camo uniforms","This book fills a void to those of us who have been interested in modern Soviet/Russian military gear. Until this book was published most of the details of the history, development and pictorial record of Soviet/Russion camouflage uniforms was clouded in secrecy. The first half of the book covers the chronology of the development and use of camouflage within the Red Army in general and especially within special forces units(airborne and spetsnaz). The second half of the book is the ""good stuff""...for the next 70 or so pages are photos and detailed descriptions of every camouflage pattern used by the Russian/Soviet armed forces. The descriptions begin with pre-WWII ""amoeba"" pattern and finish up with the plethora of patterns worn by present day Russian armed forces. It is THE definitive text on this subject. The book is also printed on heavy gloss paper and robustly bound(I know, I'm picky). I highly recommend it."
4,A collector's first guide,"Buying this book I was hoping to get a detailed portfolio of soviet uniforms, with detailed photographs and descriptios. Referring to guide books in vietnam era reenacting/collecting I find Desmond's book a little chaotic however shoving superb quality photos. In my opinion the book lacks full photos of uniform - you see only shirt front or whole silhouette of a soldier - no details of pockets, trouser's legs, flaps, etc - alle these little facts that make difference when you're a collector.This book is a useful guide for a newbee ora somebody with little knowledge. I'd throw in more additional ""era"" photos, and more detailed descriptions.Anyway the book is worth it's price and I hope it's going to motivete another autor to enlighten the subject with a larger album."
5,tr√®s-intelligent music for every human-being,"I think even after listening to it for 4 times straight, I am not ready to review it... this album is a wonder. it is for the wanderer-soul. it makes you sit and wonder - ""what am I wasting my time on... I will never get to be this talented... why bother at all..."" but then you wonder once more of how self-obsessed you are, thinking these thoughts, while other people out there give their lives away for music, so brilliantly... this art-piece is a jewel in every music collection you can imagine. like every jewel, it is hard to swallow (have you ever tried to swallow a jewel? so you see?) and once inside your stomach, it will disturb your peace, until you really have to throw-up and rectify your inner-world. Hebrew and Arabic knowledge will immense your delight of this jem."
5,A truely unique effort,This is a stunningly handsome volume; The effort combines scholarly research and an extremely valuable photographic record of many imoportant sites in Crete. The aerial photos are one-of a-kind.
3,Oh Lordy - The Car Business,"This seldom seen film is just plain fun to watch. It'll ring a bell for anyone whose ever been to a new car showroom.Even with its wild satire, everything in this film is happening right now in some US dealership. It is especially recommended to any person who has been in the business. It's a hoot!"
4,Right on the money,"EVERYTHING in that movie, including the sale of dope, I have seen in the dealership. Scumbags? Seen em. Former hit squad member trying to make money to bring relatives out of a third world country? Worked with one. Customers in way over their head in buyers remorse? Seen it. Sex with a customer? Done it. I have lived this life, and the only thing missing is the portrayal of the absolute mental grind that people with a conscience experience on a daily basis. It is the very reason that good people don't stay in the business.Except for It the last 10 minutes, this movie is everyday occurences in dealerships all across America. It is funny. Real. And very powerful. Watching the family who can't afford the car they bought is something that I have seen dozens of times over a few years. This is a must-see for people who want to know what the car business can really be like."
5,"Hilarious, from a certain point of view","If you have any retail background or sales experience and can handle the overt bigotry and foul language, watch this movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed so strongly watching something. It's audacious, but that's a big part of its charm. How did I come upon this film? My sales manager let me borrow it. It's just that tuned into what the car business feels like at times - but, of course, is nowhere near an accurate representation of current practices... I hope."
4,"Great overall, ending a little over the top","Very accurate assessment of the auto industry when there were still salespeople and not just the order takers you find today. Numerous very funny scenes and have experienced many of the meetings and customers the movie characters deal with.**Spoiler Alert**The drug issue and the final shootout are unlikely at best, but probably could happen somewhere. By no means is drug usage as rampant as portrayed."
4,Reservoir Dogs Selling Cars,The mysteries of used car salesmen and what their lives are really like are revealed in this black comedy. A racist car salesman inspires his multi-cultural staff on the tricks-of-the-trade when selling cars. We are exposed to the dark side of these sleazy salesman in this movie which has an incredible ending. A must see and a future cult classic!
3,New Car Dealer,"This film would have been better if they had stuck to the topic of everyday happenings at a dealership. The stupid inner drama of murder, drugs and gangsters would be better in a Soprano episode. But if you can watch the first 45 minutes and forget the rest, some of the characters especially the sales manager will offer the viewer a funny look what a bad dealer is. Thank goodness this is not the case of today's dealers."
4,"Too much cussing, but very accurate portrayal of car dealers","I have been a car salesman at a One-Price dealer for 11 years, and this DVD is very funny. The accuracy is pretty spot on for big cities in the old days of car selling. We all got a big kick out of some of the ridiculous stuff on here, as most of it is over the top, but some is very true.There is an overuse of the F word, and a ridiculous ending, but overall a fun film for car guys. Some of the events are things that I have actually seen before except maybe being left out in the street with no pants after a test drive and subsequent sexual interlude with a beautiful woman...I wish..."
4,Very true,A must have for anyone who has ever sold cars.Very funny and enjoyable. While low budget it captureswhat life in a dealership is really like.
5,Informative entertaining and i wish I could get it back,To my friends in the industry...BUY THIS MOVIETo the salesperson that I loaned it to BRING IT BACK!!!!
1,expected a lot more,"The tracks are too short to complete a full barre exercise en croix; the music is simplistic and uninspired. I bought this CD to play at home to supplement my ballet classes. It may be okay for a beginnners class of small children but with all the great ballet music out there today, why bother with this one? It's not worth the money."
5,Beautiful!,Perfect for ballet class. Each track is the perfec tempo and length. Others in this series are even better!
4,Groovy Holidays,"As the holiday season is here again, I find myself listening to this CD more than any other in my Christmas collection. Anybody who can't warm up just listening to Diane Reeves and Lou Rawls sing ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" must have a stone cold heart. That's my favorite, but there's not a dud on the whole CD. Treat yourself to this one."
3,Decent Holiday CD,"The headliner of the CD is Dianne Reeves/Lou Rawls rendition of ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". The female vocalists are good, the male vocalist are subpar. It's not a festive Christmas CD, so I feel it's best played during dinner or after dinner drinks. Steps Ahead rendition of ""Angels We Have Heard On High"" is the best instrumental song. I would buy the CD used and play it once or twice between Christmas and New Year's. Only ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" can be played repeatedly. The melodic tone throughout the CD is too soothing. You'll fall asleep if you devote your undivided attention to it."
3,faulty shipper,This vendor shipped only one of the two CD's I ordered and has not responded to various emails asking them to tell me why they have not shipped the second one. I am now contacting my credit card company to go after them for a credit.The CD itself was in great shape.
4,GIVE IT A TRY,"There's something here for everyone. THis...IS a jazz album...not a smooth jazz album.My wife and I found three tunes on here unacceptable and have since burned another CD excluding them and they are performed by Cassandra WIlson, Dr. John and David Koz.The remaining are quite notable and it is one of our favorite holiday CDs. For me, the High point is Mahavishnu John McLaughlin's rendition of ""Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel. The arrangement by keyboardist, Jim Beard is a work of perfection and pure beauty. Mr. McLaughlin's guitar floats above the arrangement and transcends the holiday spirit.Herb Alpert has never sounded so nice. The Becker Brothers play Steve Khan's arrangement of Christmas Waltz in a stellar performance. Guitarists, check out Steve Khan's comping....Of course, the CD was created to help fund the Special Olympics, so get this and make yourself happy."
2,"mediocre jazz, mediocre xmas - buy it used","As other reviewers have pointed out, the Dianne Reeves/Lou Rawls duet is stupendous, but not worth the price of the whole CD. The rest of the music is dull, easy-listening, ""mellow"" and hardly festive. I think I can salvage about 4 cuts off this disc (not Michael Franks, thank you), which would make it worth buying used, copying some cuts, and then donating the CD to the local library. And then give the money you save directly to the Special Olympics."
1,This Unit is a nightmare,It works well when it feels like....You Have to be careful what DVDrs you buy.It only works with the most expensive ones!If you buy TDK or something cheaper it will record for 10seconds and shut the unit off....Then to get the damn disc out it is hell.It keeps saying recovery and will not let you stop or eject.Another thing it is not consistent.Only 2\3 of the discs it creates will work on other DVd players???Go figure.If one works why wouldn't they all?One more thing if you record in 6hour mode just throw the disc out.My VCD recorder does a better job at MPEG1 no joke.
1,Lasted only 70 days,"This worked well for about 1.5 months. Then it became finicky about the DVDR blanks, sometimes failing to record on them (not a good thing when you are timer recording and gone).Now, no matter what disc, it loads it and refuses to eject. Only an undocumented keystroke can sometimes get the disc out...and it makes no difference as to the quality.I have had trouble with 4 Panasonic video items...and all I can say is Never Again!"
3,"Guys, you'll need to read the manual....","I pride myself on being able to figure things out with the user manuals. Not with puppy...Simple operations become a frantic search in the manual on how to do these things. I haven't had any problems with discs compatiblities. I bought a Sima SCC2 digital color corrector to compliment this unit. With this I'm able to back up my videos and DVD's. The quality on the XP mode is incredible, can't tell between broadcast and the dvd copy."
5,The VCR is Outta Here!,"After seven days and recording 20+ DVDs, the Panasonic E50S is fantastic. It's superior to a VCR, not only in picture quality, but ease of use. This deck has three inputs (all S-video) plus a tuner. As an electronics nut, I've connected a dedicated VCR and a DVD player to the inputs. I can copy/archive VHS tapes while watching other media on the television. This machine even cleans up old home movies. I'm using Ritek blanks (about $.89 each)and ordering them in bulk. I've recorded old (18+ years) VHS recordings and they look very good. DVDs from a cable/satellite are perfect. Needless to say, as a collector of old movies, I'm extremely pleased with the flexibility and easy-of-operation in this unit. The DVD-R discs are playing on all my DVD players. This is a great DVD recorder for all purposes although it is your basic model - no hard drive - but a perfect machine to start. Congrats to Panasonic."
1,price????,Why is this $107???? I have both movies LOVE THEM. BUT they are not worth $50. a piece. I pray this is a miss print!!!
3,so so,"Cannot say it is as ""Fine"" as I had expected. The markings are not clear and all spoons have sharp edges (no idea why they are done this way). One of the pieces had sharp spot that needed to be worked on for a bit before can be handled. The storage box is good. Overall, it's OK."
4,Good photo storage,"I agree with the other reviewer that the ribbon is a little awkward. I like the overall design though, and the fact that they stack on each other. A great way to store a lot of photos. I'll be using them instead of albums from now on."
5,rocky,an updated version of rocky horrors. Again an amazingly funny yet cautionary book. How come peter is still alive?
4,Good Book!,"I hesistantly bought this book and kept it for a month before I read it. I was pleasantly surprised when I did get around to reading it. It was quite good. Now I will need to look for other books by this author.The story is about Charlotte, a poor young lady of good breeeding who was in love with her best friend's brother Sebastian, a Viscount. Sebastian barely notice her, because she is very shy and ditsy when he is around. Then she inherits a ""magic"" ring, unknowing makes a wish and poof she wakes up the next morning with a new name and to the reality of being Sebastian's mistress. Read the book for the rest of the story....."
1,Very disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this book, from reading her previous books, I was expecting this to be a good one. This book is more of a fantasy book than a historical book. The plot is lukewarm, the characters are lukewarm. I had to fast forward a few pages every now and then. I recommend anyone to bypass this book, and it looks like she's going to go with this theme for awhile since she's writing about Sebastian's siblings. this is more like a fairy tale than a romance novel."
2,"Gimmick of the ""wish"" didn't work for me",I have enjoyed Ms. Boyle's other books but I just could not get into this one due to the gimmick of the ring and wish. Too many books to finish one that is not my style. But ... if you like a touch of magic and don't mind the usual run-up romancing you may enjoy this one.
5,Enchanting...Engaging... A delight from start to finish,"His Mistress by Morning is a refreshingly radical departure from the usual fare of Regency Romance. Although initially skeptical by the premise, I was completely drawn in from the very first paragraph and just couldn't it down. The heroine is charming and had me rooting for her from the get go. The hero starts out a bit dull and stodgy... until he too comes under our heroine's spell. This one is pure magic! Ladies if you are looking for a lighthearted Cinderella like romp, fire up your imagination, start the popcorn and grab a big bottle of your favorite libation. This one is a keeper for sure. Hopefully, a new series has been born and I for one can't wait for the next offering."
4,Best Book,"This book was excellent from page one till the end. As the saying goes...""Be careful what you wish for"". That comes into play for Charlotte Wilmont who has loved Lord Trent forever. She makes a wish to be the woman he loves and BAM- she turns into his mistress.You will love this book!"
1,Not Received,"I was excited to purchase this book on Amazon but its been a month and I have yet to receive anything in the mail. I expected it to take a few weeks, but a month is far past ridiculous. I am moving across the country in a week, and I am hoping to get it before then but I am not holding my breath."
3,depends on your mood,"If you enjoy Mary's illustrations and want to see lots of them, as well as get decorating ideas, then you will probably enjoy this book. While I love the photos of actual rooms and collections, there aren't enough of them. Instead there are too many of the drawings, which can be overwhelmingly cutesy if you're not in the mood."
5,great product,"Easy hook up, reads regions and lets you see movie as if you had the standard dvd player without doing any extra pressing of buttons"
1,Will Not Play Region 2 Discs,"Purchased this unit as I specifically wanted to play region 2 discs, which I found to my dismay it would not. When I called Pioneer, they said that they do not make an all region player and could not support my unit. On the box the unit came in, there was a sticker saying the unit had been modified to support all regions. This voided my warranty according to Oliver at Pioneer. This unit was puchased thru All Region and have been unable to call them for support. (Can't find a phone #) If anyone can help,sure would appreciate it"
5,It works,"Bedcause my husband and I are not adept at installing new equipment, my thirteen-year-old granddaughter did it for us. the picture is excellent and it works on all our foreign DVDs which is exactly what we wanted."
1,Region 1 only.....,"I also purchased this unit to play foreign DVDs (Japan - Region 2), but it only plays Region 1. Does anyone know why some folks are getting what is advertised and others are not? I purchased mine from Amazon, and not a Marletplace seller. Also, is their a mechanical way to alter the coding instead of going through the software?"
2,Not the original civilization,"This version has many edits and you can no longer trade cities for huge cash reserves, and a lot of other things that made the game promising,they just made it harder and no editor, don't buy this."
4,"Ms. Daniels really knows how to create the rough, tough but sensitive hero ....","Love at First Sight by B.J. DanielsHarlequin Intrigue # 555 - February 2000Karen's being used as bait to catch a killer. Rebel cop Jack doesn't like it. So when Karen gets hit on the head and loses part of her memory, Jack tells her that she's his wife. He knows she'll believe him because the sparks between them really sizzle. He fears two things; that he might not be able to keep Karen safe, and that when she learns that he lied to her, that she'll never forgive him.I really enjoyed this story ... Ms. Daniels really knows how to create the rough, tough but sensitive hero ... Jack could be my bodyguard any time"
4,Laugh and love at first sight!,B.J. Daniels never disappoints. Love at First Sight will keep you laughing and guessing to a chilling ending!
2,Sorry to...,"...say but this was not a good purchase. The series was hard to follow up until about the last few chapters of each book, when everything would finally come together and get explained. Though some times you had to wait for the next book to understand the one you just got done reading. Wouldn't recommend unless you have already John Farris books and like them."
4,Mandela's South Africa...,"Although the movie gave me great insight into the turbulent times of the struggle of aparthied, I wish the movie could have done more to portray the multilayered conflicts that surrounded race relations in South Africa during this time. I also felt as if the ending could have continued into what Mandela did next after becoming President of South Africa."
3,Losing his touch?...,"Talla slips a notch with this once. Better than the self titled album, but still lacks the substance of his work with Bigod 20. The music is too simple and lacks the edge of the Bigod 20 stuff. Basically, it gets old pretty quick. I guess he makes a better producer than a solo musician."
2,It went kaput.,"While I have gotten some decent mileage out of this product, I must also criticize the lack of volume control on the remote. And just recently, after having owned it for about 2 years, I can suddenly no longer play CD's. I didn't abuse it, it just died."
2,Seemed Good Until It Broke,"Maybe I'm old fashioned but it seems that a lot of today's electronics are made to be disposable. I bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday as it had both a cd and cassette player. Overall it looked and sounded fine....for about a week. After that, the cd player just stopped working. I expect things to be a bit better built than this. It is very light, but seems to be built like a lot of today's stuff. It may be a good product, I wouldn't know as I promptly returned it for a credit."
1,Worthless,This book was a total disapointment. Of all the books I've purchased on Amazon this was the first I've ever sent back for a refund. The illustrations are amateurish. The author uses historical events to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or lack thereof of different weapon systems. Only problem is his history is inaccurate thereby rendering his conclusions invalid.
3,Love pattern but THIS is too small for cereal,"First of all, I do love this pattern. It's pretty and the colors make me feel happy! Anyway, after having it for 6 weeks, I finally decided to return it because it's actually too small IMO to be really useful. It might work as a salad bowl or for ice cream but it's too small for cereal. Another reviewer mentioned using the rice bowl for cereal so I'm taking her suggestion. The rice bowl holds more than the cereal bowl and can also be used as a soup bowl or ice cream."
1,bad,"the wraps would not stay straight, constanly rolling, flimsy feeling, stretched so out of place they lost its look, won't order again."
3,Wrong Book!,"The previous two reviews are for a different book (paperback, with the same title, but no subtitle), by Stanley Diamond. Both reviews refer to Diamond's book, not Cotlow's, because they mention Diamond by name. Apparently both reviews were erroneously attatched to the hardback edition of the Cotlow book, unbeknownst to the reviewers.I'm hoping Amazon will correct this error."
5,Virtuosity!,"What can one say? This is EXCELLENT!! You cannot go wrong with this CD that showcases the sheer brilliance of Jordan's guitar technique and the beauty of his interpretations of standards such as ""Stairway to Heaven"", the Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"", among others, as well as his own ""Flying Home"".This is beautiful music."
4,Stanley takes you on a stairway to heaven,"Stanley Jordan is a great guitarist and leads you on a journey from shades of 'Route 66' to one of the iconic versions of Stairway to Heaven, This is the guy that inspired Rodrigo & Gabriela, one of the fine new acts on the world stage. Our family has had Jordan's ""Flying Home"" album on casette for a number of years (too many to remember) and I'm glad I've upgraded to ""The Best of"" CD."
4,INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING,"This witty, lively and beyond all doubt very well written account of Napoleon Bonaparte has the makings of an exceptional cable documentary or docudrama, since it brings the life, times, ambitions, accomplishments, victories and defeats of this larger-than-life military figure into crystal clear focus. Here's a book I can easily recommend for everyone, ranging from military history buffs to readers in general out for something nice to curl up with."
3,best left to the experts and/or insomniacs,If you can't name 5 important dates and 5 important people in the French Revolution you might want to skip this book. The author is an academic expert on this period and to some extent assumes that the reader is as well. Most of the text is devoted to accounts of political battles with opponents who are not very thoroughly described. This makes the book somewhat dull and hard going for the layperson.If you are an expert you'll appreciate the wealth of information in this book but will probably still curse the publisher and author for including no maps of Napoleon's battles. It is very hard to understand from the text how any of these were set up or what happened.
2,Bad impulse buy.,"I bought this on an impulse while purchasing several other singles in to fill in my Pumpkin collection, and I was fairly disappointed with this one. I am a die-hard Pumpkinhead since I first heard 'Today' back in '94, and own pretty much everything they've ever done. They still remain my favorite all-time band. Cherub Rock is an awesome song, and Pissant is good as well. However, I recommend that you buy ""Siamese Dream"" for CR and ""Pisces Iscariot"" for Pissant. I already had both when I purchased this single, and was simply trying to fill in the 'French Movie Theme' hole. Simply put, FMT isn't a song. It's just some weird music with odd humming-like noises in the background. Just stick with the albums and forget this single. Get the singles with good b-sides instead. I'd highly recommend ""The Aeroplane Flies High"" boxed set of the MCIS singles, as well as ""Pisces Iscariot"" which is a collection of b-sides from the Gish and Siamese Dream eras."
5,time,i have not yet read it i have others that i have been reading book is in great shape like new and i love all her other books can't wait to read it thanks again!
4,An inspiring book,This bookis a wonderful sourceof hope for those who are facing an obstacle right now and also shares the message that God is with them enev when they're going through a hard time. this book reminds us that when we are facing obstacles it is important to hang onto what you believe and that fith will get you through the situation. This story also shows how powerfull prayer is. There are many lessons within this book so I suggest that everyone read it even if you aren't facing a specific problem right now.
5,Embracing Life to the Fullest,"Karen Kingsbury is an excellent writer who always pulls on your heartstrings. This book is the sequel to A Time to Dance, and it is just as excellent as the first one was. Kingsbury has a way of getting to the heart of the matter and giving her characters great depth. It is easy to put yourself in each one of the character's shoes and see life through each of their eyes. Always inspiring, Kingsbury is one of the best Christian fiction writers of our day. A Time to Embrace is definitely a book that you will want to embrace!"
4,Nice set up,"Nice little set up with everything you should need to make some of your own egg sack baits. Worked as described, didn't catch any fish but hey, the bait looked good."
5,Isak Dinesen- The Life Of A Storyteller,A good indepth on Isak. I enjoyed reading it. Recomend for other readers who want to know more about her
2,Boring...,"Despite almost lyrical quality of the writing and enormous research done to produce this biography, it is somewhat boring and stilted. I am not getting the feel of the era, everything about Isak falls flat. Was this book a reflection of Isak's true nature? I don't know and I don't care either. Am giving it two stars because the writing is, of course, top quality but it is a lifeless work and echoes nothing from the past."
4,Fascinating!,"I've never read ""Out of Africa"", but I did see the movie. I've heard plenty, however, about Isak Dinesen, whose real name was the Baronnesse Karen von Blixen. What a fascinating life this woman led. The people she, her husband, Bror and lover Dennis Finch-Hatton knew, met, and took on safari is full of names that even little-read people will recognize. Her upbringing, life and adventures in Denmark, Sweden and Africa are written here with a great deal of distance, yet they are made interesting to the reader. If you enjoy biographies, this one is very good - it doesn't read like an adventure novel, but allowed the reader to enjoy the idiosyncracies of its subject!"
3,Do not confuse illustrations with photographs.,"The only color photograph is on the cover. This is a big book with 500 pages, hundreds of drawings depicting many layouts and a clear list of cabinets needed along with additional materials required to complete each layout. Each of the twelve chapters focuses on a specific area such as bedrooms, baths, beverage centers, entertainment centers and utility areas. The author offers many design variations for each area.The strength of this book is the huge variety of designs shown for each project area. The author illustrates many clever ways to use stock cabinets to create a variety of custom looks. The weakness for me is the lack of any color photographs to help visualize the results in a finished projects. This is a great resource of concepts for professional designers or decorators who have the imagination to know how drawings translate to finished results."
3,This book should be free,"It is my own fault for not reading the entire description of this book, but it is not what I first thought it was. This book simply has different layouts for stock cabinets your could buy (for example at Home Depot). I should think that manufacturers of these cabinets could give you a book like this for free to help you decide layouts. So, you have a book of hundreds of different arrangements of cabinets, and you'll probably find 1 or 2 that you actually like or need. It does seem to leave a lot of the figuring, ie measuring to fit, to you. If not free, this book should be like $9. I gave 3 stars because if you want lots of ideas on how to arrange cabinets for all areas of the house, this book serves its purpose. However, if I really rated its value to me, I'd say 1 star, maybe half. Can I return this??"
2,"Lots of plans, not very useful","This book has lots of plans, developed in CAD. Plans are in black and white. Having color pictures of finished installations as well would make it more useful. 99% of the book will never be used, and for the 5% that may be used, the usefulness is limited since it is dependent on the size of the area you're working with and where you can get the cabinets. It is just as easy to email a picture of the area you're working with to a cabinet designer and have them come up with ideas. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on it - it is easy enough to do the planning on your own."
1,Expected more photographs and instructions,"This book contains almost no photographs of finished projects. There are hardly any diagrams of the intermediate steps, and the instructions are minimalistic at best. This book assumes a reasonable knowledge of cabinet installation techniques; however, persons who possess such skills would largely find this book unnecessary. What you do get in this book is lots of line drawings of how to stack and arrange cabinets in different configurations, but these drawings are much like the ones you can get through the design services that are provided by Lowe's, Home Depot, and other major home supply stores.A better choice would be ""Built-In Furniture: A Gallery of Design Ideas""."
5,Intense emotion and terrific story!,"I absolutely loved this book. Zachary is a wonderful hero that shows a lot of growth through the story, and Caroline is very refreshing as a heroine. Devoted to her art, she doesn't waver from her goals even though she falls in love with the handsome Griffin. I did find her sisters extremely irritating, but it said a lot about Zachary's character in that he managed to put up with them without smacking them silly. (their Mother too) Her father on the other hand was likeable although excentric and I was sorry to see this book end. I cannot wait to read the others in the series, although Melbourne's story sounds disappointing according to the other reviewers. You can't go wrong with this heroine. Caroline was strong, spirited, witty and a perfect match for Zachary."
3,geography,I don't know about anyone else but there are some errors that irritate more than others. This book is based in England and centres around the town of Trowbridge.This town is in West Wiltshire. Imagine growing up there and on reading the book you have been brought up in a village and that it is in East Witshire. Some things can be forgiven but Trowbridge is the county town (seat of local government) and definitely in the west.These small errors marred an otherwise enjoyable read.
5,Great book to cuddle with by the fire!,"Suzanne Enoch is one of my favorite authors, and she does not disappoint with this book! The book is quite ""clean"" from bedroom scenes, there are fewer of them than in your regular romance novel, but you don't notice that because the dialogs and sequence of events are lively enough to keep your attention. The book is definitely funny with fast and witty dialogs. It has a ""teaser"" opening for possible plot in the next book and I'm hoping that my guess is right. The next book should be very interesting!"
3,Blooming artist doesn't know who painted the Mona Lisa?,"While overall, most romances are the same. The basic meat and bones of the story rarely surprise, but usually entertain. This book is no different and the romance is sufficient enough to keep you reading.However, I'm fairly disappointed that Enoch failed to research basic art history. If your heroine is struggling to become a professional artist, I'd like to assume that even she would know that Di Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. That is a GLARING inaccuracy. Apparently you don't need to research anything when writing a romance."
3,Appalling inaccuracy,"I'm still reading the book but there is an appalling inaccuracy that bellows a total negligence by the author and the editors. At page 70 Zachary tells Caroline that he visited the Louvre and stood for nearly an hour looking at Michelangelo's painting, the Mona Lisa. Well the Mona Lisa was not painted by Michelangelo and it's basic common knowleadge that Leonardo da Vinci did it. I guess both the author and the editor should have more care next time because it's not any obscure painting they're talking about but the most famous of them."
3,An Invitation to Sin,"This is the fist book by Suzanne Enoch that I have read. I had high expectations and was a little disappointed.The secondary characters (specifically the 6 siblings) were incredibly annoying. The chemistry between Caroline and Zachary in the first half of the book was incredibly dull. When it did heat up, the transition was not very smooth.I hope to give Ms. Enoch another chance, but this book will not be on the keeper shelf."
1,So disappointing!,"The behaviour and language was not appropriate to the period in which the story was written. (The hero kept saying ""No worries"" Argh!) I often can overlook this if the story is compelling but in this case I had to force myself to finish the book. I so enjoyed this author's trilogy ending in England's Perfect Hero that I added her to my auto-buy list. After her last two novels, she's off that list. I hope her next book will be an improvement."
3,Invitation to Sin,"I love reading Suzanne Enoch, but this book was a slow start and stayed that way. I had to put it down it bored me to tears."
3,Hoboken Hollow,"Received this movie expecting it to be a fairly good Horror Movie. After watching it, I felt as if it could have been much better but then again, I was not the writer of the story, nor did I write the screenplay."
1,Ugh,"Simply AWFUL.Bad acting, bad story. Just plain BAD.This is a graphic torture movie i could only take a few minutes of and then I turned it off."
3,The Seafarer in School,"I read this poem in school and I found it very interesting. Though this man was secluded by the ocean, he had an enormous amount of the characteristics of the land people. He even sailed just so that he would escape them. He did attempt to be religious but that was very much influenced by the history of pagan background. It was a culturally rich book."
5,Braid is the bestest band,its soo amazing when i first heard this record. not many people appreciate the quality of it. its sorta jawboxish sounding but with more feeling and more appeal. its so emotional and u can tell that the band put a ton of time behind this. u should buy it and try to appreciate it for the quality of the music.
5,The best album ever recorded.,"I have always liked Braid. The best thing about them is that each recording they release is better than the one before it. Their live show is so powerfully good that it will completely crush you. The musicianship on this album is amazing, the songwriting is astounding, and the lyrics are beautiful poetry. But each time you listen to it, these qualities seem to be present in larger quantities than you previously noticed.""Something about here and you/gives me/chills."" --Urbana's Too Dark"
5,Rock on!,Words cannot possibly begin to describe how ridiculously good this CD. Just buy this CD and set an hour aside and listen to beginning to end.
5,Beautiful stuff people,"Braid is one of few bands that succeed in sounding as enthousiastic and energetic as most bands live do. For me, this is the best album Braid has released. It's raw, melodic and sophisticated. The singing may not be the best around, but the music easily makes up for it."
5,just to make a few bucks and lose a few friends,"This is pushing the limits of emo. The only shame is it doesnt include circus of the stars, my favorite braid song besides the opener o' this album, THE NEW NATHAN DETROITSThe new nathan detroits is the best braid song there is, hands down (hands down is the best dashboard confessional song too)and it starts out with some weird noises then goes into the first verse... a bit weak. The second verse is INCENDIARY.Killing a camera is good..blah blah dozen roses is greatTrust me Braid is like no other emo band, they are so progressive and so great. Songs to download areNew nathan detroitscircus of the starschandelier swingSo remember emo kids, its not alwyas crying music...i hate stereo types"
2,pretty bad,"Sounds like a bunch of kids in a garage. A friend recommended it to me. I do like some of the other Punk/Emo groups. The Getup Kids, Alkaline Trio, Knapsack, Jimmy Eat World are just some of the few, these are the best in the industry, but not this. They just can't sing. They seem to be screeming all the time. I'd give it a one but I'm not a mean guy. No one song seems to jump out at me. After a few listens I still have no idea of what the lyrics are. I was not impressed at all."
4,Panasonic DMR-E60 @ Bytesector.com,"Panasonic has been great at designing and applying aesthetic principles and creating user satisfaction over the past decade. When it comes to their DVD recorders, these qualities are not forgotten. From the DMR-E series recorders, we will be looking at the DMR-E60 model from Panasonic. The E60 is packed with features; it is an mp3 player, DVD-RAM player/recorder, and picture viewer plus a still capture device, and much more. Let's take a look at some of the features this product has to offer......in-depth review @ Bytesector.com"
1,Scratch me,"The LCD replacement cover does protect the monitor, but is scratched very easily and needs replacement often at a price which is very expensive."
2,Expensive piece of plastic,"I've gone through 3 of these $10.00 pieces of plastic. I've spent even more time than I care to remember looking for them in parking lots so I didn't have to buy even more of them.If you swing your camera, or perhaps have the camera back catch on a backpack strap or vest strap, off it flies. I know it serves a purpose, but it's not a well thought out design."
3,ITS ALRIGHT,I HAVE ALL OF THE SUN ALBUMS AND THIS ONE IS OK BUT THEY NEED TO PUT THE REST OF THEM ON CD'S AND NOT AT THOSE OUTRAGOUS PRICES YOU NEED TO BE FAIR AND DO JUST THAT. THE ARE A REAL GOOD FUNK BAND WITH THOSE GOOD OLD LOVE SONGS AND FUNK.
2,Inconsistent Pricing,"I understand some variance in pricing between seasons/sets, but this seems quite extreme. Volume 1 costs under $15. Why on Earth would this comparable set cost more than 3 times as much?"
4,Great towbar assessory,I needed a way to attach two balls to the rear of my car for two different hitches--this was a perfect answer to my problem.
2,Avoid a bad taste in your mouth - Don't Buy This CD,"I really like Robbie Williams. I bought this CD, listened to it once . . . and waited for a catchy beat, lyrical wit, or melodic cohesion. It never happened.The rhythms sound like they came from a beat box, the band that played ""How Bizarre"" wrote better lyrics, and the melodies sound like notes were thrown down the stairs and placed in the songs in whatever random order they were picked up.Buy 'Escapology' or 'Greatest Hits' instead."
3,Not Up To His Past Efforts,"Not much really wrong with this cd, there's just a lack of the ""wow"" factor that you get from his previous efforts. All songs are listenable, but nothing jumped out as incredible. His first cd had ""Let Me Entertain You"" and ""Angels"" that were clearly destined to be hits. ""Strong"" and ""Millenium"" off the second cd, and ""Supreme"" & ""Better Man"" from the third cd. His fourth cd, ""Escapology"" is just a masterwork with ""Feel"", ""Sexed Up"", ""Come Undone"", ""Something Beautiful"", and ""Love Somebody"". This cd lacks those type of memorable tunes."
3,Not So Intensive,"Oh, how I love my hottie Robbie, for some insane reason this man can chalk up hit after hit in the UK but he has never found any real success in the US - other than my impassioned love for his hotness. None the less, Intensive Care is not quite as good as some of his previous stuff and for some reason I'm beginning to fear that my boy may be repeating his albums - they're starting to resemble each other in sound, but that's not necessarily bad. I mean this album contains ""Trippin'"" which has a very unique sound but then there's the standard ballads ""Sin, Sin, Sin"" and my fav ballad ""Pure"" (""oh lord, please make me pure but not yet."") and the cheeky lyrics we expect from the hotness that is Robbie. No matter what, I'll still buy all his albums and posters and snatch his wet towel from the stage, but that's just how I am."
5,Robbie is back!!!!!!,"Now, Mr.Gallagher tell me who is boring!!!! This album is actually one of the best pop/rock albums i listened to this year. After Escapology Robbie came back with a strong album and a very cool first single too. Tripping (which reminds me of the 80's).To all the fans of Robbie Williams, you won't regret it if you get this album."
5,The man can make music!,"For anyone who doubted Rob Williams could do it without Guy - take a look at him now. He continues the tradition of putting out thoughtful, well written, well sung songs - now with a new partner, but still his own soul in each song. I have listened to all the tracks on the BBC, and on his website and he has several new singles in the mix. Advertising Space is an easy number one spot, and his melodic King of Bloke and Bird will tug at your heart. The Trouble with Me, ostensibly written for his ex-girl Rachel is exquisite, and touches on the reality that is Robbie. Always alone.As a woman with a Mr., my heart goes out to him since he has no Mrs., but the music would not be the same if he did. We are treated to his joys and sorrows, but mostly now his sorrows. Get this album and enjoy a true entertainer. And Rob, could you get a girl so your next album will be a bit more upbeat?"
5,Robbie Williams,Loved the CD. Robbie Williams is still making great music with interesting lyrics as well fun easy to listen to pop.
4,One of the great mysteries of life.,"That title refers to the mystery of why Robbie Williams is the biggest singing star in the world EXCEPT the US. I guess we are too busy lauding vapid ""talent"" like Mariah Carey and Eminem. Too bad for the US but if you want something fresh and not run of the mill - you could not do much better than Robbie Williams. His new cd marks a bit of a departure from his previous releases. He has a new collaborator in Stephen Duffy and has matured a bit as a songwriter. That's not to say that Robbie's signature branch of cheeky bravado isn't watered down - it is just infused with a new flavor. All in all a solid release."
4,The Trouble With Robbie,"Robbie has not grown much lyrically - but he has definitely grown as a person in Intensive Care. Most of the songs on this album are about the hard times he's gone through, as opposed to earlier releases like Life Thru A Lens, that were lighter, mood-wise. Although this is relatively more serious, Robbie still dishes out his usual cheeky self in tracks like ""Spread Your Wings"", ""Your Gay Friend"" and ""Make Me Pure"".Not as strong as I've Been Expecting You, but an enjoyable listen nevertheless."
2,nothin',"In a phrase, there's something Messiah can't afford and can't be forgiven for doing - and RW's just done so. He turned down his former producer and turned to barren era (80s) awaking to his true Neo entity somewhat on two closing tracks. But I'm already into 3rd phrase, and since the whole thing is so unspeakably boring, I really go tackle neddy affairs at hand... Oh, and wasn't that album a polite nod to UK's popscene entire Coldplay-ishness (hell, it's 5th phrase!)."
3,Pet water bottle,"Nice bottle, easy to clean. Great bargin price.My only complain is that the holders slip a lot and drop off. And get lost easy. And without it.. the water bottle is useless."
3,So many errors,"This book has too many errors and too many unrealistic questions. One math question required physics knowledge, which although basic, is not required on the SAT. Other writing questions were just WRONG.Not recommended for practice tests, but maybe for the lessons before the practice tests."
3,three stars,"Like the other reviewer I bought the book for the Jo Beverley story, Forbidden Affections. I liked the story so much that I hoped it would be longer.The Marrying Kind by Debbie Macomber wasn't bad. It was a little improbable, and given the limitation of the format, a novella, there wasn't much character development.The other two stories, Castles in the Sand by Janet Dailey and Sonja Massie, and Hasten Down the Wind by Rebecca Brandewyne, because they didn't draw me in seemed long-winded for novellas. Hasten Down the Wind was a history lesson pretending to be a romance.Overall, three stars."
3,A Great Jo Beverley Story,"I bought this book for the Jo Beverley story, and I was not disappointed. If the other stories had been up to the standard of this one, I would give the book five starts.Since it is an anthology, I had hoped to discover one or two new authors to love. No such luck. The other stories did not move me, did not suck me in. The only one which started to engage me (""The Marrying Kind"") lost me with its callous treatment of the soon-to-be-jilted fiancee and the totally implausible series of events leading up to the end of the story. (And this was by far the best of the other stories.)So, a final rating of 3 stars."
2,don't buy unless you are a CEO,A few good tips but overall very geared towards the game player executive that is already in positions of power.
5,I love feedforall,feedforall is the best marketing program I have ever had. This amazing product has made my life thousands of times easier and has made my businness able to communicate with my customers in a new unique sort of way of using a technology call RSS. RSS is a great technology and feedforall has made my company's communication far more efficient.
4,Works As Advertised,"Very pleased with the detail, presentation and ease of use right out of the box. It does require somewhat of a ""techie"" background, but overall I like it. A little time consuming to create an initial feed, but once you're done the maintenance becomes very easy. The completed RSS feed be get published right on Yahoo!s Site Explorer. Of course there is always a wish list. At the top of the list would be 1) the ability to integrate XSL stylesheets; 2) generate a ""Google-style"" XML feed. Including these two items would make this a 5 star product. By the way I email'd a question to the web site and got a very helpful and prompt response."
3,Interesting but disappointing...,"With four reviewers rating this as a 5 star book, I expected more diversity than this book contains. All 10 women were drawn from the same wellness group associated with an Alabama treatment center, though not all were lifelong residents of the area. Most were evangelical Christians. All appeared to be from middle class backgrounds. If you fit into this group, you will probably relate well to the stories. If not, you may want to look for a more diverse compilation. My suggestion would beUplift : Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivorswhich draws from 300 participants and which provides shorter, solution-focused entries."
2,Disappointed,"As a breast cancer survivor diagnosed at the age of 32, I expected this book to be stories bases on women who were diagnosed at an earlier age based on the cover photo. Most of these women are in their 50's and if I had of read this book while I was actually going through treatment I would have been scared to death. Some of these women just had some bizarre things to happen to them during treatment that I would think are not typical. It made me realize how fortunate I was that everything went well for me during treatment. Also, the majority of the women were diagnosed with Ductal carcinoma, not a one of them had lobular carcinoma. So I agree with another reviewer there wasn't much diversity."
1,This is terrible,"Reviews must be twenty words long, so I'll see how many other ways I can say that this is a really, really bad movie. Let's see... Nothing in it ever makes sense, the acting was so bad it made me think the actors were trying to pretend they weren't in this movie, it was easy to guess right away who the killer was, and then there is ""The Box"" that seems to make all these bad things happen, but does anyone ever try to get rid of it? Nope."
1,Very Disappointed,I ordered this part. I recieved the wrong part 3 times. I was without a car for a week and a half. And my refund took 2 weeks to get back. I ended up going somewhere else for the part.
2,Edelbrock 3581 High-Pressure Electric Fuel Pump,"This item has 2 pictures, 1 is inline & 1 is in tank. Amazon asured me it would fit both. It is only an in tank pump. I need an inline.Edelbrock 3581 High-Pressure Electric Fuel Pump"
4,A rarity from Billy Paul to listen his great voice and music arrangements !!,"Forget the great mostly very konwledge songs from Billy and enter to another not telling history about the best voice feeling and great music arrangements !. This very hard to find record include ""Thanks for saving my life""..but the another tracks are a very beatiful sample of the most finest mix of the great Billy voice and the ambient created by a magic orchestra and chorus arrangements. If you don`t know this album...ooopss !and love the Philly Sound and Billy Paul voice...put now all your Sherlock Holmes hard to find record task force and start looking forward to find this inolvidable recording !."
4,Brilliant book,"If you're looking for a compact but detailed history and description of the Arab world, it's difficult to imagine a book that can top this one. I picked it off the shelf thinking it would be just another dull chronology - but when I examined its layout, I just had to have it. It consists of three sections: a detailed and highly readable 300-page history of the Arab world; a set of brief chapters on each Arab country; and a final short section on how the Arabs are viewed by both themselves and Westerners.The ability to pick a single country to read about individually is the aspect of the book that most stands out for me: I was really interested in reading about just five or six Arab countries, and I wasn't about to buy a book on each of them. This book solved the problem brilliantly."
4,Excellent History of Arabs up to '80s,"This is an excellent review of Arab and Middle Eastern history up to the 1980s. (It was originally published in he 1970s, with a second, updated edition about 1986.) It fills in the gaps for those of us who have only been paying attention to that part of the world for the last decade or so. It also makes clear the tensions between the different ethnic groups in the Middle East, particularly between the Arabs and the Turks."
1,Dymatize Nutrition Elite Whey Protein Powder,"long time left over product, test was very bad, i bought the same product from vitamin shop and it was much better test and fresh. i m so unhappy for this seller. they must not rip off customer. hope they will do better."
3,There are better options,"Stuff is OK, but the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey is better and about the same price."
3,TOO MUCH MONEY NOW,"I was buying this from amazon at a cost of less than $50 delivered with auto delivery. Now they cancel my Subscribe & Save order and now the new price is about $70 for 5LB. WAY TOO MUCH for this product - There are much better protein powders out there in this price category. Stay away from the chocolate all together - it is aweful. I only used vanilla and blended that with banana or blueberries, which tasted pretty good."
3,"Taste is good, still hard on lactose intolerant stomach","It mixes good, very few clumps, and chocolate mint is probably the best flavor I've had with any brand of protein. They claim it has an added enzyme for lactose intolerant people, but it still jacks my stomach up. A few lactaid pills and a few tums and I still get an upset stomach and horrible gas. I'm going to try a few other products that are lactose free before coming back to elite."
2,Funky Smell,"Shipping was quick arrived before the estimated date.Followed the directions added 1 level scoop to 5-6 ounces of water, turned on the blender, when it was done lifted up the lid and WOW what a smell. This stuff stinks. The smell was so overpowering I couldn't drink the shake. I was fighting to keep vomit down."
3,Meh...,This item gets the job done but I didn't care much for the taste. Not the best taste-wise that I have ever had.
1,Not for lactose intolerant,"Dymatize claim that they have enzymes that make this product easy to digest for people with lactose intolerance. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case. I might as well have drank an entire regular milkshake, that's how sick it made me. If you're lactose intolerant, I would recommend you try NATURE'S BEST, ISOPURE CHOC (LOW CARB) 3LB instead. I've been drinking it every day and it gives me absolutely no stomach issues. Not sure if all of the Isopure products are lactose free, but the low carb chocolate one definitely is."
5,Great tasting Protein Powder,"I kind of expected this to taste like cardboard, but wow it tastes great. I'm pretty badly lactose intolerant, and this stuff doesn't bother my stomach at all. I have the Cafe Mocha flavor. I drink one glass for breakfast and another after a workout. Love it!"
2,"Repulsive ""Gourmet Vanilla"" flavor will have you choking","The taste of the ""gourmet vanilla"" was too extremely offensive for me not to write this review and warn others. I am not someone who is new to artificial sweeteners.I hate to be so proud but I consume the likes of equal, splenda, sweet-n-low etc daily because I avoid sugar at all costs. However, even with my accustomed taste-buds I have a difficult time drinking the very bitter gourmet vanilla. The powder mixes well, so maybe other flavors are ok, but avoid vanilla."
4,Best Whey Protein Powder By Far!,"I purchased this protein powder after spending the weekend with my sister who had some. We put it in our fruit smoothies every morning and I loved it. I bought it from Amazon as soon as I got home and it has been one of my best purchases this summer. I put it in my fruit smoothies after I work out, and my kids would sneak a sip and then want one of their own. I now make protein smoothies for them every morning and they love them!This powder is so smooth, tastes good, and has the best nutritional value I have found. We have the smooth banana flavor and I will probably order the chocolate in a week or two because my husband likes to mix it with his milk to make ""chocolate"" milk."
3,Butter Cream Toffee,"Tastes very similar to toffee. However without the crunch, toffee favoring is not as appealing to me as I would have thought."
5,Delicious shake,"This gives you a good amount of protein and its a delicious flavor. I really think it melds well with soy milk and blends well. Its not chalky or gritty, just shake really well. Its almost like dessert."
3,Not so bad,"Not bad but I'd rather Syntha 6 because Its of the taste. Elite is ok, but they could work a little be more on flavor"
2,Flavor is terrible!,"Reviews were good, but to me this was more of a malted flavor than a regular chocolate and was not at all what I was looking for."
5,A great product,"I have been very pleased with this product. I am lactose intolerant, but find I can have a shake every day made with a whey protein isolate powder as opposed to a whey powder that does not have isolate in the name."
2,Big dissapointment,"I was looking so forward to trying the chocolate mint flavour. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste very good. The taste is not very strong and very artificial tasting. A true dissapointment from dymatize who are known for having some of the greatest tasting proteins around."
3,Too sweet,"Kind of too sweet for me, but I had been using ON's double chocolate which had a little bitter taste to it that I am used to. It's OK if you like sweet stuff I guess."
5,Great Flavored Protein Powder,"The flavor of this protein powder is great. When mixed properly, it has a good rich chocolate flavor. This is the first protein mix I have ever purchased. When mixing it never does dissolve 100% but the little bits that don't dissolve are not bad tasting or anything. I had to get used to the texture at first and even the smell. I am mixing it with cold whole milk and usually use it as a meal replacement when I am in a hurry. I do not like to eat large meals after 6:00 pm, so if I come in late, this is my meal for the night. For me it is all about the flavor and the price and Dymatize Enterprises - Elite Whey Chocolate has both. I am on my second purchase and my opinion has not wavered. No regrets."
1,"""Hard to swallow""","I've been a loyal user of the Dymatize Iso 100. The Elite was a better bargain, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Gourmet Vanilla and was shocked how awful this stuff tastes! The frist few days I had to drink it with my nose squeezed shut just to get it down. I had to go out and buy some low sugar chocolate syrup to add just to make it somewhat tolerable! I can't wait until I finish the 5 pounds so that I can go back to the Iso 100. Seriously, this may be the worst tasting supplement I've ever tried."
1,Much better options out there,I bought this product thinking it would be a decent protein. I was highly dissapointed. It has a very bad taste and unless you are using a blender (I use a blender bottle) it is very hard to get the protein to break down and not be chunky. Spend your money on gold standard or syntha 6. Just as good of proteins with a much better taste and blendabilty.
2,D-Elite,This product taste terrible. There is a lot better ones on the market. The fine print in the back says whey isolate/concentrate.
4,Gives me that needed protein.,I do like the flavor. I add it to my fruit smoothies and vegetable smoothies. It gives me the protein needed to avoid hypoglycemia. Not high in calories either which is good.
1,bad taste,after buying the taste makes it almost undrinkable I have been drinking whey protein for years and tried several brands. this is by far the worst tasting crap I have ever consumed!
2,Not the best...,"I've had elite whey before, but this is definitely not as tasty as the cafe mocha flavor. :("
4,Great product,"Ok, let me start by saying that i am NOT a lean, mean bodybuilder. Only bought this because I got fed up of eating meat (chicken, beef , lamb, seafood). Also, mainly purchased Dymatize because of its low calorie and high protein content. Recommender by a friend and trust me..this stuff tastes great!Only disadvantage is that you may have to use a blender as spoon mixing clumps it. Strongly recommend mixing it with milk though because tastes rather chalky with water (even added Nesquick to reinforce the taste but no luck).However other flavours may taste better than this one."
2,Not all flavors are alike,"I bought the Chocolate Mint and the Butter Cream Toffee to use and they couldn't be more different. The chocolate mixes effortlessly and tastes delicious, while the Toffee forms clumps and tastes horrible. Another problem I have with the toffee is when mixing in a shaker cup, a thick foam head forms that is gross.As for the results, both products deliver a great blend of Whey and essential BCAA's. I use it for a post-workout shake and it works well.Definitely will be buying again, but not the Butter Cream Toffee."
4,taste is good,Just started using this in the past month - definitely helps curb appetite after workout. I'll wait for another month of use to pass judgement on the effectiveness.......
3,Skeptical,"This is my first time trying Whey Protein and I decided to purchase this product because of the amount of reviews it has. It took 1 day in transit, received it yesterday and couldn't wait to try it. I mixed 1 scoop in water after my excerise program and let's just say it's a taste I have to get used to. This morning, I tried it with 6 oz of Fat Free Skim Milk and 3 frozen strawberry and boy was that good. A lot better than just water. Just water and powder does leave an after taste in your mouth, but thats's easly fixed. Let's see how it works."
1,Do not buy from DAB Unlimited,"I placed my order on July 20, 2011, and I have not heard back from them. I am still waiting for the product. I will never buy from DAB Unlimited again. They should not be a partner with Amazon!!"
1,Poor Customer Service,"The item was suppose to be deliver on the 6th of October and by the 12th I had to contact the seller for then to be told, oops, there was a problem in the wherehouse and we dont have it available! Thanks for the waist of time!!!"
3,It is ok.,I concur with previous posts about lactose intolerance. Use water or cut milk with water when blending. The chocolate and vanilla flavors are tolerable in taste over time. Avoid the berry as it tastes and smells like vomit. If you have to use the berry then blend with the vanilla and use milk.
5,Best protein powder I tried...,"I ordered this powder based on some positive reviews, and I'm VERY happy I did. I've tried MANY different powders over the years, and none had the good nutritional values (especially low low low cholesterol), BCAA's and such great taste. It's actually GOOD tasting, not just tolerable, like most other products. I had Vanilla, which is the easiest to taste off flavors, and I didn't get any. I personally throw a tablespoon of hot chocolate mix in as the company I ordered it from was out of chocolate at the time.Great product. I'll never use another unless they stop making it."
5,Dymatize Elite Whey Protein,I bought the 10 pound Dymatize Nutrition Elite Whey Protein Isolate Gourmet Vanilla andit is an excellent price for the amount you get. It is great tasting and I would buyit again and recommend it to others.
5,Love the Protein.,"This is one of my favorite proteins. It mixes well with just about anything. Plus, it doesn't have that ""chalky"" protein taste. It also was delivered quite quickly. Thank you!"
5,Thats alot of protein,"This is a lot of protein which makes it a good deal if you'll use it. I have used the smaller products before so I knew what i was getting. The 10 lb product comes in a plastic bag this is inside of a box. Not as nice as the 5lb jar but not a big deal. You'll save a lot of money by buying this product.This is by far my favorite protein (the chocolate, however I love the vanilla for mixing in shakes, the chocolate can be drank alone with water)"
3,All we're going to get for awhile,"This is okay if you can't find her albums, but it's no substitute for any of them."
1,Incomplete and riddled with errors.,"The book is limited from the outset by deliberate decisions to ignore some of Dylan's more important and powerful features (multiple inheritance, for instance). To that it adds glaring technical errors when comparing Dylan to other languages, right in the beginning, before anything gets really technical. To that it adds multiple typos per page. I quit reading after Chapter 2 and returned it for a refund, something that I have NEVER done before with any technical book!If you want to learn Dylan, buy the book by Feinberg et al. I fully agree with its average rating of 4 stars."
5,Aoife Clancy's voice is heaven,"The Song's ""Green Grow The Rushes Oh"" and ""Broken Wings"" alone would make this collection of music worth the price. Toss in the other great vocals and instrumentals and you have one of the best collection of traditional Irish music available today.Aoife Clancy's vocals were the heart of Cherish The Ladies music for several years and this collection includes many of her best.Buy it and you'll never regret it."
4,Celtic Music,"If you are a Celtic music fan, you'll like this one. It has a good variety, including some dance music."
3,Good item for kindle,"Chesterton is always interesting and although this may not be one of his best -- the ideas are thought provoking as only Chesterton can present them.Few electronic ""typos"" but very readable at a good price."
3,Can't quite place this book...,"Downloaded, but still trying digest what it is really about! Wouldn't suggest or recommend it as a must read. Borders on being a tad long winded!!"
4,"Clear, organized, easy to comprehend",This text is great for anyone trying to learn about human resource management at a beginner's level. The text is very clear and is fairly engaging with real world examples throughout. I could use some more color/images on the pages though just to keep it more interesting!
3,There is no page number,"I buy it for my human resource course, but the page number is totally different from the package book. So it is a little bit hard to follow the teacher."
4,"Managing Human Resources, 10th edition","This product was received in good condition, minor markings did not make reading difficult. Service was quick. Great price for product. Much appreciated. Thank you.Managing Human Resources"
3,review of book,"Although the book has none of its pages missng, the book has a lot of markers and underlines in it. In all, the book was fairly used."
5,Well written & enjoyable ancient history,"`Augustus' by Anthony EverittIn this eponymous titled work Mr. Everitt tells the remarkable story of Rome's first emperor, Augustus. Clearly, it is brilliantly researched, extremely well written and a really enjoyable book to read. Anyone looking for an entry into ancient history would be well served reading this book. Mr. Everitt does spend an inordinate time on Octavian, Augustus' name before he became emperor, however the book remains a comprehensive source of information not only on the life of this truly unparalleled Roman leader, but the Julio-Claudian family overall. The family lineage, which is a difficult feat for anyone to successfully describe, is very well laid out and clearly organized in both text and helpful chart inserts.I had read Everitt's earlier work on Cicero and was immediately hooked on his writing style. Fans of the aforementioned book will not be disappointed with his follow up, `Augustus'. Enjoy."
4,Good Read with a Good Mix of Information,"I found this book to be well written and straightforward in its presentation. The Author includes information regarding Ceasar Augustus that is interesting and relevant on many levels - not only about politics and the Roman state, but also about individual personalities, personal relationships, and gossip of the time. The inclusion of such personal insights also made the book a bit of a page turner - sometimes it reads a little like a soap opera. The inclusion of such multi-dimensional information on Augustus and the Rome of his day helped me to get a feel for what it must have been like to have been there. This book is not detailed enough for an academic or a scholar, but is just right for someone like me who just wants to learn more about Ceasar Augustus and his times. The book is merely a chronologically organized collection of well written stories about people who led remarkable lives."
4,A good read,"I found this book to be an engaging and interesting read. Because of the ancient nature of this biography, the author had to opine about the actions or motives of different people at various times in this book. However, the author also explained his rationale for why he believes a certain action occurred which helped me to gain further insight into the motives/thinking of a person in ancient Roman politics.In addition, I found it quite interesting that this book cleared up many myths/stories which I picked up in wating HBO's Rome and the mini-series, I, Claudius."
1,Chapter missing,"The introduction and 1/2 of the 1st chapter is missing, unreal. Where is is the quality control??? It will be returned."
5,Excellent,"May be one of the best History books I have ever read. One has it all; gratuitous sex, violence, back stabbing.. the works!"
1,Paragraphs missing,I bought the e-book version of this biography and whilst the book was interesting enough - entertaining in fact - it drove me crazy that there were paragraphs missing at the beginning of every chapter; suddenly the text made no sense! I was so annoyed I returned it to Amazon - no hassle! - but I'd rather have the complete version...
4,Sexual Chocolate,"The book was pretty good, even though the character Trey kinda got on my last nerve. It's a very descriptive book. I could visualize almost every scene described in the book-Good job Mr. Luckett. I did not give it a 5 star for the same reason that someone else wrote, I was disappointed in how it just ended.Jackie from Ebony Eyes book club"
1,Can I rate this half a star?,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book and I can't find enough words to say how disappointed I was once I began to read this book! It was long, tedious and just plain boring."
5,Squlane is SUPERB,"I've used squalane (another brand in the past, and, for the past 3 years, NEOVA's squalane)for over 10 years, and it is the ONLY skin care product I refuse to be without. This oil is so incredibly light, and so beautifully absorbed that it's difficult to believe it is an oil. It literally glides over the skin and immediately relaxes the tight feeling of dry skin. As I've gotten older my skin is even drier, and the oil gives a soft glow that softens lines. It is an excellent base for foundation, and lovely alone or with moisturizer. I'm 59, and this is THE product for daily use."
5,Perfection,"This is a great punk rock spanish CD, by far Ataque 77is the best punk rock spanish group ever, there area lot of covers on this album, just a great qualitywork by Ataque, well done."
3,"Good, not great...","We found this book to be one of those that had a foot in each camp, so to speak, giving some technical and some 'psychological' tips that apply to taking nude photo's of your partner. While the concept is good, the execution was lacking, and the book was a bit light in both areas.Personally we would have preferred something a little more technical, perhaps even formulaic, showing how (settings, lighting diagrams, etc) particular shots were achieved.The writing style was another thing we found odd. It had a rather stilted, almost academic feel to it, rather than a friendly, chatty, 'hey guys, you want to take dirty pictures of your wife, here's how..."" feel to it, which is apparently where this book is aimed. Feel free to disagree.Finally, the fact that the author says the entire book's photo's were shot the day the book was due at the printers speaks volumes. A book's photo's shot in a day or two ? They were average, not great, or even particularly good.Clink, clink, 2c deposited."
3,TO BE THE BEST,"PRESENTLY ""PLOWING THROUGH IT"". iT'S BORING, IT'S WORDY, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME OF HER BOOKS."
1,Should be titled Had Had To Be The Best,"The story was continously jumping ahead so it could be toldin the past tense. The word ""had"" appeared in most sentences one or two times except in the Epilogue. A low estimate, I would guess the word was used 1200 times. Very annoying."
3,BARBARA...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??,"I READ THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH I HADN'T READ THE ONES PRECEDING IT. AND TO BE TRUTHFUL I'M GLAD I DIDN'T. IT WAS ALITTLE ""JUMPY"" GOING FROM ENGLAND,NEW YORK, AUSTRALIA AND I THOUGHT THEREWAS ENOUGH SADNESS IN FAMILY WITH THERETARDED SON OF PAULA AND THE LEUKEMIADEATH OF ALEXANDER BUT IT WENT TO SOAPOPERA LEVEL WHEN PHILIP'S WIFE MADDYSUCCUMBED TO A BRAIN HEMMORAGE. I COULDNOT BELEIVE SHE HAD HER DIE. BARBARA,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"
5,Amazing,"All issues in this series are completely amazing. I love showing off these short films to my friends. ""I Love Sarah Jane"" is probably my favorite one here, but I kind of love zombies."
4,Nice product.,"I needed a more lighted space in my cubical at work and this is great. I've mounted it with some double sided velcro strips, so I didn't mar up the shelf it's under, and it's fabulous!"
2,My first Ongala disappointment,"I thought this was one of Ongala's original recordings to remind me of 'good old days' growing up along the lake shores of western Kenya. It turns out this is Ongala renditioning some of his old popular songs in the English language. Comes out as artistically weak and unoriginal in my opinion. However, if you never knew Ongala's work of the 80s, or are not a diehard fan of authenticity you may actually find this CD enjoyable."
4,Pounding Grooves,"The title says it well, this is a compilation of detroit-styled grooves, banging all the way.While to me the 'album' loses effect after the first half, taken individually the tracks are deep, funky and damn banging.And of course, 'The Bells' is there, making any dancefloor-head gurn like a maniac.Reccomended for those who have heard other Jeff Mills stuff and liked it."
3,Classic Detroit Techno,"How can you say anything bad about a cd that includes the Detroit Techno Classics ""Alarm and The Bells"". Both of these tracks can be played at anytime during a party and the crowd will love them. I think Mills was hitting his Peak during the production years of the tracks on this cd, although some are from earlier Waveform days. Also prepare yourself for duplicate tracks if you buy some of the other compilations As Mills Likes to Recycle his music through time."
2,Captivating but poor language,"While I found some parts of the novel to be rather far-fetched, I found many good explanations of an emerging technology and its potential dangers. I would have liked to have read this book to my 11 year old son who would have been fascinated. Unfortunately, the book is filled with foul language which, in my opinion, does nothing to enhance the story or the message that it carries. I am disapponted that a writer of his caliber should find it necessary to do this and I find that it detracts greatly from the book."
3,Interesting and Yet the Same,"Crichton once again amazes readers for his complex grasp on diverse subject matters. This book looks into the implications of nanotechonology an up and coming field in production. The story is interesting and keeps the reader guessing. The one thing that upset me the most about it is that it is exactly like Jurrasic Park. Man creates a device/creature....man looses control of aforementioned device/creature....terror ensues. Crichton has overdone his common theme of the dangers of unrestrained scientific exploration. Prey is extremely similar to Jurrasic park, only on a molecular level. A good read overall yet not new or surprising."
3,A Nano Scale Version of Jursassic Park,"A nice travel book, nothing more, nothing less.Having read all of Michael Chrichton's novels, I can say with high degree of certainty that he has become very predictable.At times I wasn't sure whether I was reading Prey or Jursassic Park (or the Nano scale version of it).Be that as it may, one simply cannot ignore Crichton's remarkable ability to introduce very complex subjects to the layperson without taking out the fun of reading."
3,Fun reading but not his best,Prey is an entertaining read but fails to live up to a thriller such as Timeline. I think one of the reasons is that Timeline had so many subplots and different settings that it was impossible not to be enthralled. Prey is interesting in the fact that Chriton's display of his scientific knowledge about nanotech is exciting but I felt the book was a little one dimensional where Timeline (I think his best) forced sweaty palms on the reader. I just didn't get as much of a thrill from Prey
3,a book lover,"This book was entertaining enough. Not as great as Jurassic Park, but still worth reading. That is if you are like me and know nothing about Nanotechnology. He tells you just enough so that you are interested and want to keep reading but doesn't drive you crazy with details. Apparently if you know more about nanotechnology and other technologies that are written about in this book, you may not like the book as much. But really if you are geeky enough (I mean no offense, by using the word geek) to work with this stuff in real life, then you should read non-fiction and not fiction books dealing with this subject."
3,Technology gone evil...,"You can read the editorial reviews for the book description. While a very interesting read, it was not very entertaining. Some areas seemed to drag on. For first time readers of Michael try Sphere or Disclosure first. You will not be disappointed..."
3,"Typical Crichton - good story line, no character development","I liked the story, but like many of Crichtons other novels, it ends quickly. I felt like I was watching ER. The story builds, with no character development, and then ends quickly...I do admit, I will read his next book and love his ideas...."
2,Too Quickly Assembled,"As usual, Michael Crichton begins with the most fascinating science and ethical questions of our time, and a great idea for story, and churns out a book in poorly written prose. The characters are two dimensional at best, there are some inconsistencies within the plot, and the rhetorical cliches could only be perfect for, you guest it, a B movie script. Once a gain, a brilliant idea degenerates into scenes better suited for action movies than educated readers."
2,Terrible,"Crichton has written many super books, but this is not one of them It's downright stupid. Hey, if those nano critters couldn't deal with a stiff breeze, why didn't those high tech folks just put together some battery powered fans. Every time someone dies, it's just ho-hum. I liked the first part when we get to share housework and shopping with our hero. Really exciting and takes up about 25% of the book."
2,Improbable Science,"A really good novel illustrating the potential danger of nanotechnology would be a welcome addition. Prey is not that novel.Here's the plot: Somewhere in the Nevada desert, a hi-tech corporation has been experimenting with nanotechnology swarms. Of course, the little critters get loose and begin evolving into fierce predators. Jack Foreman, an expert in designing computer programs that mimic the behavior of swarming animals, is called in to deal with the swarm. Jack's wife is a Vice-President at the firm, but she hasn't clued Jack into the big picture.I won't give it away, but the swarm evolves so rapidly - and unbelievably - it's difficult to sustain belief in the storyline. Actually, it's impossible. Adding to the disappointment are B-movie characters that blur into the background, their tracks sinking out of sight in the sand of a sluggish plot."
2,It's Crap,"Well, maybe not crap, but its nothing spectacular, either. Once again Michael Crichton brings to life a story that he once could have written so much better. Little tiny robots have been invented, and theyre smart. And they can learn. And adapt. And...do things that youd only expect in a horrible John Saul book. For the last 50 pages I kept expecting the alien's spaceship to come out of the clouds and end it all. Not that this book was about aliens (at all), but it had that crappy sci-fi feel to it.I've no doubt that nanotechnology could become dangerous if used carelessly, but the scenarios Crichton imagines border on the ridiculous. This is the kind of book you buy at an airport, and when youre finished you leave it on the plane so the next person can have it. In some cases people do this to share a good book with a perfect stranger; in this case youre doing it 'cause its just not worth carrying around. 'Prey' will pass the time, no more, no less."
4,Michael Crichton does it again,"If you like to read a suspense book that makes you look at technology a different way, this is the book for you. I love how Michael Crichton can show how science can get out of hand. He just might be the George Orwell of his time."
3,"Prey are elephants, when you're Godzilla","Oh boy! You can imagine my excitement when I finally purchased a copy of ""Prey"" -- the book that the local chapter of Hopeful Homosexuals of Guatemala has titled ""...a true coming out of the closet novel for both the protagonist and the villain.""The daisy chain formed by Cross, Cooper, and Samson is top-notch, and the fur really flew when Patterson decided to throw in a few mice into the mix. WOW!But despite all this excitement, something was missing...something that I'm sure all readers of ""Four Blind Mice"" was left asking: did each mouse know that there were three others, and hence he was not special? Maybe this question is best left unanswered, but I for one would've given it the fifth star if Patterson tied this knot."
3,"Entertaining, but a little stupid on several levels","I listened to this on a cross country flight. I enjoyed it, but overall I find much of it mis-informed, bad science, and inconsistent even with the authors asumptions. The characters often seem to behave stupidly. Crichton tries to explain that which he of course can not and just gets himself deeper into stupid explainations. Note that I am NOT saying nanotechnology does not have any dangers, or that evoloving replicating nanobots are not possilbe or that emergent behavior does not exist. So enjoy the read, or listen, but don't think about it too much and don't take the narators explainations as factual (this is FICTION after all). (I don't want to discuss inconsistences etc here since such would be spoilers)."
2,Not a Believable Story,"I have enjoyed quite a number of Michael Crichton's books (such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Timeline) and I have to say that Prey is one of the worst that he has written. Jurassic Park/The Lost World is based on the history of dinosaur and in a way, it is a believable science fiction. Timeline is based on Quantum Machanic and he has done quite a good job in making it as believable as possible. Being an avid science reader myself, I find that his interpretation of Nanotechnology lacking in many ways. The story is full of flaws and at times, I really wonder why hasn't the author done more research on the subject matter before taking on the challenge (He has spent many years in preparation of the Timeline story according to him).Nevertheless, if you look not too deep into the details of Nanotechnology, it is quite an engaging storyline. Hence, the 2 stars."
2,"Just another ""Body Snatchers""","Once again, Michael Crichton demonstrates his talent for squeezing the most amount of words into the least amount of sense. This really is little more than another ""Body Snatchers"" tale, interspersed with Luddite warnings of the imminent dangers of technology, which are in turn brought to life with the kind of plodding descriptions that show you that the only thing he actually understood properly was the use of copy and paste in his word processor. Kind of embarrassing at times, even. He's got scenes about from inside an ER that show such astonishing ignorance of a field he really was never in. A painful read in those places, particularly. But then, a lot of his stuff is. If you know anything at all about the subjects of his books, you almost always seem to understand them better than he does."
3,"""Prey"" is Not Usual Reading Fare","Michael Crichton's ""Prey"" is not your usual summer time reading fare. It's like a tossed salad of fact and fiction but you might not like all the ingredients. The language of some of the characters (e.g., ""Charlie"") can get vulgar with the swearing and cussing. If you are sensitive about this, you could probably skip over Charlie's comments without too much loss in the story! However, Michael Crichton creates a fictionialized story with current ""hot"" trends or topics such as Nanotechnology and the computer programming technique called ""Genetic Programming."" So too, this story involves swarms of nanoparticles that coordinate their movements based on predetor/prey dynamics. This book (hardcover version) has references in the back of the book for further study about a subject matter that should be of concern for public discourse and debate related to Biotechnology and Bioethics."
2,"Good concept, dopey execution","The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one."
3,Better Movie Than Novel,"This novel was my first exposure to Michael Crichton. Though I had seen several of the movies based on his books, I had never read him before. The book was an extremely easy read; I devoured it in one day. I liked the conversational style of his writing and the vulnerability he portrayed in his Everyman hero, Jack Forman. The pacing was well-done and the urgency of the situation kept me engrossed. However, parts of the story seemed awkward and his writing seemed sloppy in places. The story was told in first person, but Jack gave information that he couldn't have known (since he wasn't in the room, etc. etc.). It seemed like Crichton was writing this one for a movie, since most of the flaws in the writing would not have mattered in the staging of a film. I thought this was an enjoyable thrill ride, but not a particularly impressive or creative piece of popular fiction."
4,Good Book!,"This book is an excelent novel. Michael Crichton out does himself. Writing one of the best books i've read to date. This book is about nanotechnology and how it can destroy us and how we have to be careful with science and nature. Its a good novel, but some parts can be difficult to understand. Great book, I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,A Perfect Wonder,Wow! This book was amazing. It was amazing how inorant some of the people were yet I still believe that that was the true nature of human kind. Micheal Cranton made it seem so real that it makes you think it may have already happened this is definetly a great book.
1,try another Crichton...IF you work hi-tech!,"Being in hi-tech, I couldn't get past a few chapters. I like Crichton's research and his imagination, but found this book sorely lacking. Maybe it picks up midway, but I don't waste my time on a book that doesn't grab me right away, there are too many other options."
3,Prey Tell,Another in the Jurassic line of pulp fiction. If you want very light (air headed) beach reading that has the potential to make you wonder where we may be headed this book is for you.
3,Man it starts off like glue on a cold day......slow,"Crichtons, style seems to take a great deal of time to do anything. The first half is so slow I almost but it down. I do like most of his work so I plugged on until it got interesting. Nice work using cutting edge tech. in the book and taking it down a very dark road."
4,What Did You Expect?,"Michael Crichton ain't Shakespeare, but he turns out a pretty good techno-thriller. In ""Prey"", irresponsible scientists develop a swarm of microscopic ""nano"" robots that gets loose and turns mean. Hijinks follow. It's a quick and exciting read. Just as ""Jurassic Park"" looked at the darker side of genetic engineering, so does ""Prey"" introduce us to nano-technology and give us reason to approach it with caution. You could do worse for beach reading than Crichton's latest thriller."
4,Entertaining... Again.,"Another Crichton novel, and like all the others I read it cover to cover in one sitting. Unfortunately, the similarities don't stop there. The plot is a 21st century update of the Andromeda Strain, with elements of Jurassic Park thrown in for good measure (even the 'iterations' preceding each part). Parts of the book come off as techno-preachy as Chrichton warns us once again of the (legitimate) risks that we meddlesome humans are stirring up. But complaints aside, this is still a great novel by any standards. Just knock off a star because it's not his best."
2,An Awesomely Bad Movie in the Making,"A decent opening and some good basic science are extrapolated into the most ludicrous B movie garbage that would insult the intelligence of an 'Independance Day' fan. Lack of attention to basic plotting too, for example the hero is forty years old and attended university in the late 70's yet the book is set in 2009, go figure.Crichtons unique style makes it readable, but can't stop it insulting the intelligence, no doubt the basic issues need to be raised though."
5,"Chilling, cautionary tale","If you value sleep, please pass up on this one. Not because it's scary (although, when you think about it, it's downright terrifying), but because you won't be able to stand it, wondering what will happen next. I imagine you might know this book will be made into a movie, and some of the scenes might be written with that in mind, scenes that beg for awesome special effects.Crichton does so much research, you have to wonder, ""what if...?"" The theme of technology overtaking society has been around seemingly forever; however, with the news of a baby clone being born today, you have to wonder...how long before the scientists lose control? And how many would it take to ruin things for everyone? Well, just a small handful....read this book!!..."
2,It was so-so,"Like other reviewers, I think his vision of an army of rapidly evolving nano-robots is unique and rather frightening if it came to pass. The book starts out strong and draws in the reader. However, much of the book's buildup read like the Andromeda Strain and the conclusions at the end were over the top and ultimately not believable."
2,Not really one of his best.,"I really like Michael Crichton, and have loved many of his books,especially Jurassic Park and Congo. This offering was not that good. Igive it three stars because, like all his books, it is well written. Hedoesn't do a very good job on the subject matter though, nanotechnology. Iwould have thought a writer of his caliber would have done more research onthe subject before he committed himself to a novel, but obviously hedidn't. If you want to read Crichton then read something else. You willcome away from this book not really wanting to read any more of him, andthat would be a shame."
2,Reads like a movie - a really bad one,"Given several hot new techs to play with, Crichton mangles his ambitious introduction to the promise and perils of each. Long-winded, particularly at the beginning (easily half the book is consumed by character development that eventually goes nowhere), even still somehow the setup is left half-baked by the time an attempt to patch plot-holes appears at the end. Scenes stolen from ""Fantastic Voyage"" and ""Aliens"" appear without the benefit of Racquel Welch or Sigourney Weaver. I agree with another reviewer - this book reads more like Koontz than Crichton (that claim not intended to impugn the former!). What a disappointment - would be rated a three, but docked a point since it comes from a master."
1,Worst of Crichton Novels,"Found this Hardcover version on bargain section of Borders in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, grabbed it without a second thought, brought it to the hotel and started reading the first few pages...Forget about Jurassic Park, Congo, etc. This novel starts extremely slow, and it continued to be very slow for a very long time.Though the nanotechnology issue is intriguing with Crichton's usual finese in researched information back up, it cannot salvage from this sinking Titanic plot. There are a few sections which are interestingly written, but mostly mundane and boring. I have fallen asleep many times reading just a chapter from this novel. I always pace myself to finish reading a book to the very end, since I am not to judge it until it is totally depleted. Well, this novel is not for me."
2,Better when it was called Jurrasic Park,"In Prey Michael Crichton rehashes the story of Jurassic Park, except this time instead of dinosaurs you have a swarm of killer nano-bots and instead of an island it takes place in the desert. The book reads like the screenplay he is sure to develop from it and quite frankly he should have just skipped the whole writing a book and gone straight to Hollywood.It's a fast read and an ok story, but wait for the paperback."
3,Good but not Great,"Prey starts out slow with the domestic life of the main character. It is only about 100 pages into the book that the plot begins to get interesting. Be sure to stick with it even though the first few chapters are a bore. Once Prey starts going it is hard to put down, and many plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat. There are, however, some major flaws. The book's subject matter seems very far-fetched. It is hard to imagine that something similar to the events in the book could actually happen. Also, the science that lays the foundation for the book was very complex and hard for me to understand. Next, the ending is confusing and leaves a fair number of questions unanswered. Prey will be enjoyed by fans of Crichton, like me, but those not familiar with his work would be advised to pass Prey by. He has written better books, that are more interesting and easier to understand."
2,"Prey, the unabridged audio","I have always been and will continue to be a fan of Michael Crichton but ""Prey"" was a disappoinment. Since publishing ""The Andromeda Strain"" the author has written several screenplays in the guise of novels in which technology runs amuck. This novel follows the same theme but is tiresome. ""Harry Potter"" is more fun and for that matter more believable under the circumstances. The audio book was poorly narrated--at first I thought the bateries in my machine needed changing so I changed them but the narration remained slow. Also, the narrator continuously pronounced Nevada the irritating way Nevadans resent. For those interested in the audio version, don't waste your money on the unabridged version--buy the abridged for a quicker and less tedious ""read."""
2,"Great concept, but....","The concept for this book, especially in the hands of Crichton has huge potential. Unfortunately, it falls short of the very bar that Crichton, himself, set. The novel is obviously very well researched and there is an extensive bibliography at the end. I only wish Crichton had spent similar effort on the plot and the characters. The plot is fairly linear and predictable and the characters are mostly shallow and stilted. This is one of those rare cases where I wish the editor had indulged the author a bit more to allow him to render a richer environment and a deeper plot."
3,Let's prey,"As a great Crichton fan, I was looking forward to this new novel (as I much as I am looking forward to the one coming out in November). It seemed so very much on the pulse of the newest and hippest technology today : nanotechnology. It seemed as promising and ""fresh"" as Timeline. Unfortunately... it turned out not to keep any of those promises.First, it takes half to book to get actually thrilling and tense. We spend too much time in the family life of the characters. Then the suspence starts and pick up slowly. By the time they hit the cave, there are only a few pages left and you wish the book would have been longer.So all in all, OK but could do a whole lot better."
2,Crichton going downhill fast.,"(a few spoilers here) This book is not a true exploration of Nano-technology and it's possibilities. It is a science-fiction mind-number in which the villian (the ferocious little nano-bots) have no limits. One second they are starting to recognize shapes, the next they eat a few memory-chips and start controlling human minds. Is this believable?And as if this lame plot were not enough, the story is chalk-full of flat characters acting entirely obvious. The prose is weak, the dialog is worse. I officially give up on Crichton, Airframe was bad, Timeline was dreadful, and Prey was nearly unreadable.So my advice in a nutshell: if you loved Jurassic Park, you will STILL hate this."
2,Quite Mediocre,"I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (blech.)This book is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution. The last portions degenerate to a long ""beat the unstoppable monster"" sequence.Might make a good movie on the Sci-Fi channel.Save your money. Or, use it to buy Charles Pellegrino's ""Dust""."
2,"If you must have it, find it at a yard sale.","This is a good story idea poorly written. At times, I was convinced that Crichton's twelve-year-old (if he has a 12-yr-old) wrote it. It was just that bad. The dialogue is often comical and should be embarrassing for a writer of Crichton's credentials. Crichton's insistence on using sentence fragments masquerading as complete thoughts was annoying. Literary license is one thing if it adds to the story. But sloppy sentence structure that leads you off in the wrong direction, or leaves you wondering what is being said, is inexcusable. If this story makes it to the big screen, it will need a major rewrite, hopefully by someone other than Michael Crichton."
5,Great read,"Very good book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is into computer science. It gets a bit technical, and knowing what hes talking about makes the book all the more fun to read."
2,"Gripping, but utterly misguided","As a long time Crichton fan, I have waited for Prey with bated breath. Prey is a page turner, from the very first page. It's as exciting as it is fast moving. However, it is also an utter disappointment.Nanotechnology as a subject has so much potential in the hands of a master of the technology thriller such as Crichton, but he completely fails to take advantage of it, so we end up with a book that reads more like a modern ""Night of the Living Dead"" rewrite than a Crichton technothriller.Plot holes abound, particularly near the conclusion. Instead of the technothriller everyone was waiting for, we get a half way decent action movie script (and it's already been sold!). It's formulaic, and anyone with half a brain could already see the entire plot from the first chapter, leaving the work devoid of suspense.All in all, a good read, but wait for the paper back."
3,PREY: The Movie,"I should start by saying that I'm not exactly a fan of Michael Crichton's work. I used to watch ER, but in most of his novels it seemed that he was trying too hard for the reader to like him. DINOASAURS! TIMETRAVEL! FLYING DISEASES! O MY!Anyway, I just got the feeling that this book was more of a screenplay than a novel. The descriptions seemed more like stage direction than real explanations. It was fairly predictable, like a good ""B"" movie.However, on the whole, it WAS mildly entertaining. It would be great for a vacation to read on the beach or plane. It does get a bit technical here and there, but if you skip the science babble the story is still VERY easy to follow.This is my first reveiw so I hope this was helpful!"
3,Decent quick read based on the same old formula,"Prey is your typical Michael Crichton fast paced science thriller. However you feel about Crichton's past novels, you will feel exactly the same about this one. Like most other Crichton yarns, the book covers a time period of only a few days, during which the fate of the world hangs in the balance due to some technological catastrophe caused by overly ambitious scientists. Also like his previous books, Crichton will educate you on a particular branch of state of the art science. Where previous novels covered fields such as paleontology, time travel, aeronautics, and virtual reality, Prey deals with the menacing new threat of nanotechnology. For me, this is the only reason I keep picking up every new Crichton book that comes down the pike. I enjoy learning about the latest cutting edge technology within the backdrop of a ""worst case scenario"" action story. Otherwise, I usually stay away from these sort of fluffy, beach book, dime a dozen thrillers."
1,Terrible,Maybe the worst book I've ever read. One dimensional characters and dialogue so bad it's like nails on a black board. The author clearly mailed it in on this one.
5,Easily Crichton's Best,"Prey is the fastest moving, most interesting and most terrifying of all the Crichton thrillers I've read, and I've about read them all. Crichton has an ability to stay on the cutting edge of science while spinning a highly readable tale."
2,"Same formula, worse results","Crichton uses his standard formula again in this novel: a startup company develops a new buzz-word technology which goes out of control. In this case the buzz-word is nanotechnology, which could be interesting, but not with this execution.The novel's beginning is it's best part. The protagonist is a family man who is looking for a new tech job in Silicon Valley, when he begins to notice weird occurences surrounding his wife and kids. Unfortunately the novel suddenly changes tracks, and most of the interesting early sections of the book are forgotten. For the latter 2/3 of the novel the reader is treated to detailed yet ridiculous situations involving the biotech organisms in the middle of the desert. This is one of Chrichton's worst."
5,I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I really liked the book Prey. It had a good and realistic plot. I think people who like science fiction would like this book. The only parts I didn't like was the bad language and that people died. I would like to read some of the other books of Michael Crichton.
2,De ja vu all over again,"I used to really like Michael Crichton, he was cutting edge and new. The problem with Prey is that in truth it owes an awful lot to a book that came out two years previous to his called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. Nanoparticles that can mimic humans, eat flesh and become a formidable foe. Sure that book is far more complex and the nano tech is just one part of that book, but it's so obvious to me having read Prey that Crichton read that book and borrowed the bits he liked that Prey has made me lose a tremendous amount of respect for him. Prey on its own is okay for the first half, strange things are happening and the hero doesn't know why, but many of the questions are left unanswered, and perhaps the most annoying thing of all was the lame last minute attempt to wrap everything up with a two page excuse near the end. It made the book very unsatisfying. Disappointed."
3,I remember when....,This author wrote books about real science. These books tended to have what a story needs namely belivable charecters and a resonable plot. There is none of that hereJurrasic Park was great and the Lost World was O.K but after that Crichton's work began a slide. Its still going on I just pray that it doesn't get any worse.I'm reading The Andromida Strian agian please take my advice and give this one a miss.
1,Crichton's Worst!!!,"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan. I've loved him since I read ""Jurassic Park"" in three days when I was ten. Twelve years later and I can reread his novels again and again. ""Prey"" was a HORRIBLE disappointment. It seemed as if he had merely gone through some first drafts of earlier books and cut and pasted them together. The first person narrative was extremely ineffective (Crichton's never done this before, for good reason apparently.) To be honest, I'm sort of embarrassed for him. Oh well, I've got my fingers crossed for the next one..."
4,Very Good,"""Prey"" tells a story of nanotechnology run amuck. It is wildly entertaining but not quite as good as ""Jurassic Park"" in my humble opinion."
2,"Sorry, Couldn't Finish It","I had been looking forward to reading ""Prey."" Crichton was such a master at the futuristic thriller that I was hoping for a good read. Unfortunately, after 200 pages, I couldn't go any further. The characters were not interesting and the premise was unbelievable--even for Crichton. The storyline was completely predictable from the beginning and I completely lost interest. Crichton has produced some fine novels such as Andromeda Strain, Timeline, The Great Train Robbery, and State of Fear. ""Prey"" is not one of them."
3,Meh keeps you awake,"Pretty good book, easy to read, and entertaining. I wished that there would have been more action taking place at home than at the lab. That was a bit boring. The book was predictable, but in a good way, I mean of if you've read a lot of sci-fi books then you can pretty much tell how the book is going to end.The ending it what I kind of didn't like. It seemed so rushed and shoddy. I was absolutely flustered at the end cause you know there isn't a Prey 2, so I think he could have rapped it up a little better than that."
3,Disappointed in Boston,Definitely not his best work but kept me riveted for about 150 pages. The last half of the book was a big disappointment. I got the distinct sense I was rereading Sphere at times (although Sphere I thought was much better). As the book winds down his plot twists become comical and where definitely written for his next movie project.
2,Wait for the Movie,"I have read two reviews of this novel. Apart from some mild criticism, both were favorable. These reviewers have been too kind. Prey is one of the most poorly written novels I've ever read. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it offers some interesting ideas as well as some fascinating information about the burgeoning new science of nanotechnology.Michael Crichton didn't try to write a readable, engaging novel here. All the characters are one-dimensional with virtually no character development, and much of the dialogue is inane--in one chapter, two of the main characters spend a half a page discussing the virtues of various disposable diapers!Prey isn't a novel--it's just a sloppy treatment of the film (complete with some interesting ideas for cool special effects courtesy of the author) that will undoubtedly be forthcoming in the next year or so. In this case, the movie is sure to be better than the book."
4,Predictable pattern but interesting thriller,"Michael Cricton's story telling pattern is pretty predictable. His story line is rooted in modern research, (how many other fictional thriller novel's do you know that end with an appendix of cited sources), where the outcome is carried to a plausible fictional extreme and wrapped up in a tightly told tale of adventure and mystery. Not that this is bad thing, this pattern offers plenty of room to write original story lines, and in the end Crichton knows how to spin a great yarn. This book brings together nano-technology, computer software and gnome technology. I didn't find this book as good as TimeLine, which was a great book, quite similar to DoomsDay in many regards, but much tighter to read. Nonetheless I enjoyed this book as a quick read, a brief past-time pause, like a cool lemonade on a hot day, refreshing even though it doesn't last that long.[...]"
4,A Great Technology-Gone-Amuck tale,"Chricton gripped me once again after Timeline, with the introduction of nanotechnology, something foreign to me until this book. But, aside from the technology that Chricton delves in to (as usual), the story kept me turning the pages. What held me the most was the antagnost that was neither phantomesque nor man, but something one may never conceive of. The story did tend to dwindle a bit toward the end, but it was a quick read. Chricton is now officially out of the dog house for giving us Airframe."
3,Could Be Worse,"Since you can read about characters, themes and storylines elsewhere let me go right to the point: what kind of reading experience does this book provide? Crichton is always best read for the way he handles plot, he is a master of the cliff-hanger. At the end of chapters, and, in this novel, even in the small subsections of the chapters, Crichton manages some real zingers that propel the reader to turn page after page. However be cautioned, nearly a third of the novel is a waist of time. For example, the opening chapters while providing some set up, drag due to trite humor about the central character's life as a stay-at-home dad. But the real flaw is a final section that stretches credulity beyond the limits, falling to the level of C grade sci-fi horror. There's even goo involved! The other two thirds crackle along at a very entertaining pace, amusing the reader in the best Crichton fashion. Not a total loss, but not his best."
4,Next Movie,"This book is going to make a great movie, just like Jurassic Park. Remember how Jurasic Park's theme was that nature cannot be harnessed? I cannot give this book a 5 star rating (save those for ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" or ""Pillars of the Earth"" (Ken Follet). However, Prey is a good read. I could not put it down until I read the whole thing - it made me late for work."
3,just another screenplay,First half was good -- premise was excellent. Second half was nothing more than a screenplay. I could hear the soundtrack in my head as I read. Disappointing.
2,Nano-bore,"I read one review that PREY should have been longer. I wanted it to be shorter. About 200 pages shorter. The ""NEST"" chapter would have made an excellent short story. In PREY, what precedes the ""NEST"" is dull, and what follows is ridiculous.Crichtons evolutionary factoids are as welcome as always. However, the idea that nano-particles will actually be visible to the human eye (""black cloud"") or can be simply blown off with up/down bursts of air severely stretches his scientific credibility, and hampers the already-flawed plot.PREY could have been a taught, logical thriller like Crichtons previous works, but ended up reminding me of those silly radiation-monster movies of the 50s."
2,Shows Crichton's limitations,"My major complaint with this novel is that it's pretty obvious that Crichton never once actually ran this past someone who is experienced with the electronics side of nanotechnology. From about page 70 I started nearly screaming -- ""so when are you [guys] going to construct an EMP generator""? The idea of disrupting the silicon parts of the nanotechnological beasties is something that never occurs to any of the supposedly technologically savvy types in the book. The fact that the ""final"" solution was totally biological in nature just shows the author's lack of training or knowledge in this area..."
5,"Great, as always.","I bought this book at around 6:00pm and finished it at 12:30pm. I COULD NOT put it down. Crichton is in fine form as always, and makes a number of difficult fields (nanotech, intellegent computer systems) very accesable. Impress your friends by talking intellegently about convergent technologies! Plus I'm afraid to turn off the lights for fear of..."
2,Crichton drops the ball.,"Sorely disappointing. I want to say that I like Crichton, but this was just a joke. The idea is fascinating, but it's executed in an insanely predictable way. I think that Crichton is just re-writing the same novel over and OVER again: Protagonist is trapped in a secure facility. Means to safety is outside that facility in an unprotected building. WATCH OUT. Oh, it's all okay. Whew.I'm glad that's finished. Spare yourself."
4,Operation PredPrey,"This book is about a man who is without a job, basically the house maid because his wife works for a major science company and has no time to take care of the home. His wife seems to be cheating on him, and avoiding him and the three kids they have. But one day his wife is in a car accident, and his point of view about her cheating on him is washed away. The next day he is sent to work in an isolated scientific labratory to try and stop the predprey that are expanding quickly and seeking destruction of the humans. meanwhile at a town hospital, john's wife is still recovering from the car crash. Can john survive/destroy the predprey before they multiply to much? Is his wife the secret of why the predprey are expanding? Find out in the new book Prey by Michael crichton!"
2,A disappointing experience,"In no time at all you will be ""preying"" for relief. One-third whine about the travails of a stay at home father, one-third info chunks gleaned by Dr. Crichton's research team and one-third loosely structured story, the novel is filled with logical incongruities and haphazardly conceived story development.Having read many of the authors earlier works which provided enough of a scientific framework to create a believable possibility, Prey indifferently attempts to fabricate a storyline with apparently little interest in whether or not the ""facts"" presented as the building blocks of the novel fit together in any cohesive or particularly interesting manner.It will probably make a visually interesting movie. Don't waste your money on the book."
2,not crichton-like,"I read nearly all of michael's novels. This is my least favourite. The topic nanotechnology is exciting and Michael, as usual, does do his homework on it but the story and the characters he built around it somehow do not fit in it. An out of work team leader who does household duties, a handful of programmers becoming biologists and a working mom/full time scientist all handling the 21st century nanotechnology: it just does not match. With this topic at hand, the particles able to resemble a human form, I was more thinking of the liquid robot from the Terminator 2 and with that given you can create a much more juicy story."
4,"Good, But Not Great Crichton Novel","This novel was not up to normal Crichton standards. The last 150 pages were exciting and made it hard to put down, but the first 150 pages were boring and almost caused me to quit reading it. I was expecting a story like Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Congo, or Timeline that got you into the action fast as well as taught you about the science and technology Crichton is covering in the story.He did cover how the emerging nanotechnology of molecular robots combined with biotechnology and computer technology could get out of control on its own. These molecular robots swarmed together and developed emergent behavior (learning new responses to new stimuli) based on a predator model which becomes life-threatening to those who created them.The book is worth reading, but not one that enthralls the reader from beginning to end."
2,"If a 10 part recipe, this was 9 parts research and......","......1 part writing. Crichton has been my favorite author ever since Andromeda. Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure - all brilliant. He started losing me with Lost World, which was Disney-kid fluff. In this one, his science extrapolation is excellent and classic Crichton. However, the writing was dreadful. ""I did this, then I did that."" Some authors use first person as a crutch; here it is a fully powered wheelchair. I lost track of how many times Jack tells us there is no way out and he'll be dead in seconds. And he tells us this so matter-of-factly that you expect Jerry Seinfeld to show up and say, ""Ah, that's a shame."" And what do writers do when they can't portray the intended angst? They use exclamation points; ug. The characters are painfully stock, and the dialogue is B-movie. The most dynamic relationship is clearly between Jack and Julia, but the lack of pre-crisis Julia character development made me not care about the denouement."
2,Prey It's Not Made Into A Movie,"Well, although I usually enjoy Michael Crichton's books (not to mention ER and his movies), this one is definitely not his best work. Full of cutesy ""Mr. Mom""-type scenes and dialogs of the male protagonist, but devoid of characters you might actually care about, the plot moves along through its Jurassic Park paces, towards the inevitable happy ending. I just found it boring."
2,DULL & PREDICTABLE: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This is not Michael Crichton's best work. An interesting idea, but not very well fleshed out or expanded. I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife. So who cared if she became infected. PREY they don't make a movie."
2,Achieved Far Below Potential,"This book probably deserves a 3 star rating, but I had to penalize it one star because Michael Crichton is capable of so much better. On the positive side, I enjoy Crichton's books because I feel like I learn about cutting edge scientific information. In this respect, the book did not disappoint. The book included interesting information about both animal behavior and advanced technology. And the book was somewhat entertaining, in a ""feel like I've just wasted my time"" sort of way. Character development and dialogue, never strengths of the author's, became notable by their awkwardness and artificiality. As the book progressed, it read more and more like a movie script for an implausible, B-grade horror movie. I'm sure that most readers who have enjoyed Crichton's other books will feel disappointed by this effort. It is apparent that it was written with the movie potential in mind, and effort was not taken to make it into a good book first."
2,"Good start, weak finish.","I used to really like Michael Crichton, and I still *want* to like Michael Crichton. Unfortunately, _Prey_ is not his comeback novel. It feels like he is in such a hurry to get the books out these days that the parts of them are just sketched into place.The idea of the nanotechnology baddie in the book is timely and clearly well-researched. The ending, chase scenes, and all the associated stuff aroudn the relationships, could all have been left out. Too bad."
3,Not his best ...,"Michael Chrichton is one of my favorite authors of all time - I have read most of his books - many times over in fact. But I was disappointed with ""Prey."" I truly had a hard time getting through it - it didn't grab my attention, nor did I feel particularly involved in the plot. Honestly, it felt like a chore to get through the first few chapters. The book picks up a little steam mid-way, but not enough to make up for the lackluster beginning. I give the book 3 stars, because on its own, compared to your typical book written by a typical author, it's not bad. But if you are a die-hard Chrichton fan, you may find yourself disappointed."
2,"Technology flawed, story weak","I've read virtually everything written by Crichton, because thetechnology is well presented, and the story is usually fun to read, atleast. But in 'Prey,' the technology, as described, is not evenself-consistent, and the story reads like a screenplay.Disappointing."
4,A Very Impressive Read,"I read this book over two days. It's definitely a page-turner in the same league as The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park. But best of all, it gets down to the science of ""science fiction"" in ways I think some of his other novels (Disclosure, The Lost World) seem to have neglected. While it's not ""hard science fiction"" (e.g., the sample computer code in the novel doesn't even make an attempt at looking like a recognizable programming language), it has enough scientific detail to keep the SF fan interested. The characters are also surprisingly well-thought-out, especially for a Crichton novel (where the characters are normally not nearly as important as the concepts). All in all, I would recommend this book to SF fans who were interested in a good read, or any reader who is interested in being introduced to Crichton's writing."
2,Has Michael Crichton been corrupted by Hollywood?,"For the first two thirds of Prey, I was enthralled. Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors, and Prey was up to my expectations.Then in the last third, I thought the book fell to its knees. The plot devices were no longer credible, even given the suspension of disbelief inherent to this type of book.My hypothesis is that Crichton was thinking of the big screen when he wrote this book. He put in things that will make great scenes with modern special effects, but that just don't work in print."
2,Not one of his better books,"This would have been a decent short story. First half is almost boring, and I almost quit three quarters of the way thru. He stretches the book with a lot of non-essential househusband whining which the feminists will love. Science is too farfetched and his descriptions of the mechanics of the factory are difficult to follow. You keep wishing a decent sized dinosaur would show up and give the book some energy."
4,PREY,"This book was an all around good book. Some parts were a little boring, but in the end it turns out to be a good book. If you read this book it is very much time well spent. In my opinion you don't get much out of this book, I mean yeah it's a very good book but you don't really get anything out of it. The strengths of this book are that it's very suspenseful, like you never know what is going to happen next. A weakness is taht in some parts it becomes very scientific and boring. My recommendations on who should read this book, are people who are into or like science or if your just looking for a good read. I erally do not know of any books taht are similar to PREY, considering this is the first time i've ever read a book of this genre."
2,Crichton Can do Better,"Interesting premise, but so formulaic that Crichton's real motivation to take this straight to the big screen becomes transparent. Michael, don't let us down. Remember your roots and Andromeda Strain."
2,Often amusing but implausible and unsatisfying,"I bought this book on CD (abridged version) because the plot sounded intriguing. I managed to finish the entire book (so it wasn't completely without merit), but I was disappointed. The story was not very engaging or believable. Too many coincidences. Several of the plot lines were just plain silly. I appreciate a dose of real science in my fiction, but in this case the extrapolation from the science was absurd. The book had no other redeeming virtues to compensate for these deficiencies."
2,Where's the emotion?,"While the technical plot and science were interesting, the lack of any real human emotion among the characters was something I found to be disconcerting. Without giving away much of the plot, I found a lack of realism in the effects that friends' and long-time colleagues' misfortunes had upon the hero, Jack, as well as upon each other, not to mention the lack of emotion about what was occuring to spouses and children.This, to me, was such a major shortcoming that it made the whole experience unbelievable and unsatisfying for me as a reader."
2,He frowned. I said. Then I did. I said. You will frown.,"This is the first M.C. book I read. It was kind of fun, especialy liked the cliff-hanger parts on the end of the chapters. I almost expected a commercial after each.Michael Crichton delivers a fun book, but not a very well written book. I frowned. She frowned. They frowned. GET IT!?If anyone is a Next Generation fan (Star Trek), you will be able to guess most of the book. Those crazy ""Nanites"", were able to do so much in such a little time. I kept expecting to see the Terminator 2 robot pop up somewhere in this book.Once again, just like alot of his work, scientific advances go haywire in a secret isolated environment. I read the book. I frowned.The ending is pure Hollywood."
2,Crichtonian Formula,"I have been onboard with Crichton since Sphere came out many moons ago, but, sadly I am jumping off his bandwagon. I trudged through Airframe, Disclosure and Rising Sun to see if he would return to his own created genre. However, what original ideas he used to have are now becoming formulaic non-sense. Here is Crichton's formula - Research Obscure Technology + Find Worst Case Scenario + Have Technology Act Out Worst Case Scenario + Isolated Location (underwater, desert, medieval Europe, whatever)+ Ignorant Character and Children = brilliant novel, plus a script Spielburg will look at (crosses fingers). Can't wait to see him tackle the time-travel issue, oh he already did. It was enjoyable in a mindless way, plus you get to feel smarter about yourself afterward. Anyway, I'm not expecting much from him next time and I'll wait for the paperback."
2,Hard to believe the same guy wrote The Andromeda Strain,"The synopsis of this book and the blurbs looked very promising and even after it begins you get off to a good start, but soon this book dissolves into a boring plot that is sci fi at its worst. I've seen this plot elsewhere. I really thought sci fi and humanity would combine forces in this novel to tell a great tale of struggle against a new kind of bad guy and that maybe it contained a message to the future to beware of how far we push the technological envelope. But this promise never fulfilled itself. It's amazing how quickly this book rocketed to the top. I enjoyed CLONED LOVE and SILICON SECRETS by two unknown authors far more than this book and so will you."
4,Classic Crichton,"Another classic from the King of Thrillers! Not my favorite Crichton, but definitely high on the list -- a captivating technology/biowarfare thriller with a uniquely Crichton-esque spin!"
3,"Old Story line, new twist","This novel is about nano-technology and a group that creates nano-robots that can perform actions as a whole, unfortunately they turn on their owners and thus the thriller part of this book.As a whole, I love most all of Crichton's work, and while I enjoyed this one I think it was lacking a lot. First, how many novels/movies have a plot where a robot is given artificial intelligence and then turns on the owner??? The only thing that makes this one unique is that it is nano-robots that work as a team and evolve. Second, I love reading Crichton novels because while entertaining, I also feel that I learn something new each time. In Prey, he glossed over the technical stuff way too much by barely going into distributed processing and nanotechnology. Now he may have done lots of research for this novel but it didn't show this time.It was still an entertaining book that I finished in just two days because of its addictive nature but coming from Crichton I expected better."
2,Starts promising but ends flat,"""Prey"" is the first book I have read by Michael Crichton. I was intrigued by the premise of an artificially intelligent being based on nanotechnology. The plot is captivating at first, but there are so many scientific impossibilities that it was impossible to suspend disbelief for long. The way the bad guys are dispatched of is especially bad, reminiscent of old ""B"" movies. Key plot details are given cursory explanations in the last two pages. Overall, I felt my time would have been better spent elsewhere."
2,Crichton going through the motions....,Prey follows the standard Crichton formula quite faithfully but much less capably than some of his past works. I got the feeling while reading Prey that Crichton was just going through the motions and at the end of it I felt much less fulfilled than with some of his previous works. As brain candy it worked but it doesn't achieve much more than that. Prey can be an semi-entertaining 4-5 hour read but don't expect more than that. It is what it is.
4,"Timely, annoying and recommended","A very good story, one of Crichton's best and very thought-provoking. A potent threat -- an ""evolving"" cloud of nano-particles which act as an organism -- is actually made believable as the book rolls on. On the bad side, the first quarter to a third of the book goes VERY slowly and the protagonist is a whining, somewhat sanctimonious ""Mr. Mom"" -- basically, a loser. Things change when he gets into the action theatre and changes to a proactive, resourceful person. The ending is a bit far-fetched even with the good foundation in the middle of the book. But, it ought to make a terrific movie (duh!!)"
2,Jurassic park meets nanobots,"Michael Crichton has done it again! Yet another shallow novel based on a dubious premise filled with interesting scientific detail and characters as flat as matzoh bread. If readers find the plot eerily familiar to Jurassic Park, that's because it is -- secret lab loses control of its invention, which turns on them. Give me a break! And just like Jurassic Park, an ""evil"" scientist sabotages any effort to rein in those wacky new life forms. Captain Underpants dispatches his enemies in 70 illustrated pages -- why does Crichton require over 300. There is no suspense, no character development, and no attempt to create a credible antagonist, i.e. the nanobots. As Lincoln once said, ""People who like this kind of book will like this"". Otherwise, wait for the movie."
2,A reversion to earlier days,"The first half starts off well. In the Crichton tradition it builds the mystery slowly. Little clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout. The pages begin to turn faster until you are dying to know how everything ties together. It reads much like Disclosure or Airframe.But then the ball drops into the basement, where Terminal Man days are relived.Monster loose. Monster kills everybody. Hero uses gun/explosives/brown sludge. Hero escapes by helicopter. Hero calls Army (thankfully it's not the Costa Rican ""more teachers than soldiers"" Army this time, but rather the good old US Army who sits in a warehouse awaiting phone calls from panicked scientists to go blow stuff up).All the clues, the buildup, and the tension were wasted. The wrapup was force-fit into a paragraph, and the grand mystery wasn't so mysterious after all...."
3,"Entertaining in places, mostly good science","The science is well researched and interesting, but told as too much exposition and not enough worked into the story itself. The characters are reaonably well drawn, and the silicon valley atmosphere (before the crash) is recognizable although a little too much of a stereotyype.The first two thirds of the story run well, but starts to get fantastic towards the end and the denouement is a little too far fetched, although if you can manage a willing suspension of disbelief it's quite thirlling. It does manage to keep you guessing to the end.If you like Crichton you should like this somewhat formulaic novel, and for sci fi fans generally it's worth a read. Not the kind of book you are likely to read more than once.It does have a good bibliography for those who want to follow up on the science.The Amazon editor provides a good plot outline."
2,Pop science movie script,"Reading this book I got the feeling that I was reading a movie script that wanted to combine Alien with Outbreak. The story was formula. It appears the author was attempting to write a script that would allow a director to make use of particle animation technology along with a number of other special effects. If what you want to read is science fluff, this is your book. On the other hand, I'd wait till the movie comes out (bet on it)."
2,Crosses the border from Science Fiction to Science Fantasy,"One of the things I always like about Crichton's books was that there was always a feeling in the back of my mind that the story was somehow possible.From Jurrasic park's ""DNA locked in amber"" to the ""alien life form"" brought down by a satelite in the Andromeda Strain - I always believed that someday - this kind of thing might happen,In Prey - however - I just didn't get the same feeling and I think the book goes way beyond what can someday be possible.Crichton puts the story line of Prey in present day terms when in fact - technology such as this won't be available for many, many years - not in our lifetime anyway.If Crichton had put this story a few hundred years in the future - it may have worked"
4,"Great science, good story.","I`ve always liked the length of Crichton`s novels. Not too long, not too short. Just right. This one is no exception.The science behind his latest novel is painstakingly researched, although not 100% correct at all times. I`ve heard numerous scientists in the various fields touched upon by Crichton in his many novels complain about this. To the casual reader, this isn`t all that bad of a problem, though.Prey is told through a first-person perspective, and although not one of his best, is deffinitely classic Crichton style. Once Jack is flown by helicopter out to the 'Fab Lab' the action is non-stop. At times a bit spacey and unbelievable, but always fast, fun, and entertaining.Pick it up if you`re already a Crichton fan, and if not, pick it up and become one."
2,Dirt Bag,"This book gives new meaning to the words, ""dirt bag."" The predator is a artifically created swarm of robotic dust. The author doesn't seem to appreciate the difference in words like evolution and mutation. His whole world is evolving and his story very nearly unravels. It is just a bit too preposterous to swallow even if the author does believe it possible. It doesn't hold together as well as his swarm. Too bad. Save your money."
3,Borrow from a library,"CD/abridged/Science Fiction: This book takes place over the course of a few days. The what if scenario in this one is nano-particles gaining intelligence and trying to take over humanity. I felt the book was weak and had several shortcomings. After just finishing Timeline, which was engrossing, I say borrow it from a library.The narrator does a fine job, but the whole story was missing something."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This was my first Michael Crichton book, and I'm about to buy another. It held my attention throughout; in fact, I read the last two thirds of it in one sitting.I'm only giving it four stars, though, because of one recurring flaw. I'm a stickler for realistic dialog. A commonly used phrase in English is ""Oh yeah?"", but in this book, all the characters say ""Oh yes?"" instead. Who says ""Oh yes?""? No one I've ever known, that's for sure. It's like some idiot editor decided to do a blanket search for the word ""yeah"" and replace it with ""yes"" in every instance. Now that I think about it, I don't think the word ""yeah"" appeared anywhere in the book. Very unrealistic, and very annoying. I feel certain this was indeed an editorial blunder, because the rest of the dialog seemed fine to me.Other than that one thing, it was a fun, enthralling read."
1,The worst possible book i've ever read in 50 years!,"Well here it is 2008 and I bought this to read while on a flight to Cancun to work. The plot is basically terrible, the first part of the book reads like a General Hospital episode. The part of super manager fails unbelievably. Worse, I already had a better way to destroy the supposed villain at half the book's length than the ending. AVOID THIS BOOK! Anyone that has seen the movie, (yeah, I know I'm using a movie reference here) The Matrix knows that EMP will kill any computer type device unless it is hardened to MILSPEC (I'm thinking that Dude missed this movie....). So to kill nano machines that use electrical circuits? EMP! DUH! This book is dull and boring and not worth the cash I paid for it."
2,lacks depth,"when pop novelists like crichton, iles, and clancy toss in dialog between the sexes, their failures as complete novelists are revealed. crichton can command all the techno mumbo-jumbo, but when the characters actually need to speak with one another, it becomes laughable. the recipe is the same....always a cute, young coed helping out the middle-aged expert in his field. the flirtations are obvious, but out of respect for one another, they reject all notions of consummation. had this pile of words included a graphic romp in the rack, another star would have been earned."
5,Another Heart-Pounder,Don't read this book if you are a compulsive neat-freak or finicky eater. Crichton takes us into the world of science in 'nano' terms for a pag-turning novel - I read it in one day! I love his diversity of subjects and always keeps up thinking about the future of technology and where it is taking us! Give it a read!
4,Pushing it.,"There is no Crichton fan who will be able to say this is his best, because it is not. I am a a lawyer with a pre-med degree so obviously Chrichton and other physicians in writing draw me. I love the way Dr C. sets up a possibility and brings it to life for his readers.This time he dreamt up a possibility, asked us to believe him, we tried, then he made us feel foolish. Still love the guy though."
4,Interesting look into the future,"This book caught me by surprise, I didn't expect to like it but Mr. Crichton captured my attention from the start. I usually shy away from a story that gets to technical but he kept the tech material interesting. I also was plesantly surprised that he wrote in the first person, which in this story, made the context real and more believable. I highly reccomend this book."
5,Wow,It has been a long time since I picked up a Michael Crichton book and this one is fantastic!!!! It kept me reading into the long hours each night. I recommend it to anyone!! Interesting concepts....but you have to like science to like this book. Its very technical
4,Crichton always entertains,What is so scary is that the story line is not all that far fetched.It takes you from everyday to creepy in the blink of an eye.
4,Entertaining Look Into The World Of Nanotechnology,"As per usual, Michael Crichton takes a top that he is currently interested in (nanotechnology in this case) and weaves an entertaining story around this central theme. Better than Crichton's last book (Timeline), I quickly got through this story and wasn't disappointed in the slightest bit.For all Michael Crichton fans I would recommend ""Prey"" and I think you would find it a good, albeit light read. If for nothing else, Crichton's meticulous research into the field of nanotechnology is worth the price of admission alone and the backstory is better than I expected it to be.**** RECOMMENDED"
3,"Good plot, too predictable though",The plot was good and the science was very interesting. It was way too predictable though and lacked any surprise at the end.
3,Crichton has written better but this one is still fun,"Typical to all of Mr. Crichton's works is a great twist on reality that hits so close that it almost could be, and thank goodness it isn't! The story was intriguing but unfortunatley it was a bit predictable. I knew what to expect about one hundred pages before the end of the book."
1,Painfully slow and boring,"The first one hundred pages of this book focused primarily on the protagonist's suspicion that his wife was having an affair. Incredibly, he shrugs off his son's claim that his wife had men in the house while he was at the hospital having his desperately ill child treated for a suspicious illness. The book is unbelievably slow and boring. I gave up after the first one hundred pages. Pass on this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is not worth the read. I am a fan of Mr. Chichton but this book just doesn't work. The characters are weak along with the plot. I wish Mr. Chichton would stop with the futuristic Science Fiction junk and stick to the more humanistic style stories such as, Rising Sun and Disclosure."
3,Great concept but fell apart later,"I loved his earlier work, but this one even though a great concept really fells apart in later part of the book, you can actually out run airborne nano particles, an okay book, not a great one."
1,Used book sold as new by amazon ~ very disappointed,"""The slight mark or stamp that may be present on the edges of a bargain book's pages is an industry's identification that it is an overstocked book and is not to be sold at the full price. Bargain books are not used, previously-read, defective, or inferior in any way.""~ quote from Amazon.I bought this book for my son & it had the mark on the edge which didn't bother me. HOWEVER, there was a credit card receipt from someone else's purchase in it so it was NOT NEW & obviously PREVIOUSLY READ.Very disappointed."
3,Neutral,"A rather disappointing effort on the part of otherwise outstanding author. The topic has an enormous potential, which in this book didn't get the full measure of Mr. Crichton's talent. Good analogy would be a 007 movie, where you relish the realism until it occasionally devolves into ridiculous and unlikely spectacle.The use of too many clich√©s and simplistic language along with inferior chracter development further diminishes reading experience.On a positive note, Mr. Crichton, as usual, delivers an exciting dose of engrossing technical detail and intellectual insight. Fast and exciting pace (after a slow beginning) keeps the reader glued. But don't put it down, as you may not be drawn to pick it back up.Verdict: An utterly interesting topic and accompanying insight, diminished by a disappointing treatment and execution."
4,An exciting story with an intersting twist,"I enjoyed this novel from beginning to end. Crichton's ability to merge nature and technology together was definitely the highlight of this book. I enjoyed learning about the potential for nano-technology and the power of distributed computing. From a technical standpoint this book was great. However, the story took a long time to reach a climax (Which was very exciting) and I felt almost bored for the first few chapters. I recommend this book to those of you who are interested in a twist on Artificial Intelligence and who have a healthy imagination."
3,"Great at first, just plain silly at the end...",First 3/4 of the book is interesting and semi believable. but it just gets to silly at the end and ruins it all.
1,Pray you don't buy this book,"I have loved Crichton's books since the Andromeda Strain but Prey isn't indicative of his previous work. The premise is ridiculous, the plot moves at an uneven pace and relies on anonbtuse belief in technology. The whole book rushes along and then ends with a literary can of Raid. If you like his techno thrillers, read Jurassic Park again."
4,Scary Stuff!!,"The more I read about the possibilities of the future, the more I embrace our past. Now it is nanotechnology which poses the threat and Michael Crichton has done with it as he has done with other similar themes, i.e. he makes terrible things sound reasonably possible. While I must admit this technology was not on my radar screen before I picked the book up, it surely is now and if you would like to spend some discomfiting time getting entertainingly educated, this is your opportunity."
2,Promising Premise But Lame Ending,"The premise is promising--a secretive startup firm becomes the first company to manufacture commercial quanitites of simple nanobots that can perform a complex funtion as a swarm, and they get loose. However, the kind of havoc they wreak increasingly strains credibility, despite the author's repeated descriptions of the ""emergent behavior"" that a rapidly evolving swarm is capable of. The ending is so outrageously over-the-top that it reads like the script of an amateurish B movie. What a shame because Mr. Crichton could have concocted a less fantastic, but ultimately more deadly and interesting menace."
2,Predictable...,"I'm not sure about you, but I've read enough suspense novels to fill all of my book shelves.And this book is not as good as most of them.And to top it off, Crichton attempts to educate us on nanotechnology and AI subroutines throughout the book. If I wanted to read a book on nanobots, I'd go buy a book on it. Similarly with AI.Basically, this is your standard, technology runs amok book. Well written but predictable as white snow in January.Yawn...."
1,Quite Possibly The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"I hate to speak ill of the deceased Michael Crichton, but this book was terrible. Dr. Crichton spends way too much time on the trials and tribulations of whiny househusband Jack Foreman. The middle of the book gets somewhat interesting if you can overlook the fact that a team of programmers suddenly become action heroes and kick ass and take names. Lead by the aforementioned Jack Foreman.I had finally made it to the last disk, and some of the ridiculous dialog made me finally just give up. I only regret there is no rating below one star."
4,High tech creepiness!!,"I always feel smarter after reading Michael Crichton's work. Maybe that's more of a statement about me but I like to think it applies more to Crichton's ability to deftly weave high tech science into a horror story. That's what this book really is. It also plays well as a family drama for a large part of the book. The protagonist, Jack, at times seemed too flawless but overall he was likeable. I would recommend this book is you don't have problems with techno-babble!"
3,Would probably be a better movie!!!,"Ok...so it's probably been a good fifteen years since I picked up a book by Michael Crichton. I saw this one sitting around the office one day as a co-worker had finished reading earlier in the day. Since I was looking for soemthing to read I picked it up and went to town. So what did I think? Honestly, it was just OK. The good is that it is an easy read, and filled with a decent amount of action. The bad is that the book starts off relatively slow, and it reads like a movie script. I mean not literally, but in the sense that it seems as if Mr. Crichton was writing this with idea that it could be turned into a movie. I've read plenty of his books, the science seemed right on, it just lacked the intriguing characters and heart of his earlier works."
4,Prey's OK,"This is a fairly good thriller from Michael Crichton. He weaves a few interesting concepts(nanotechnology, biotechnology, and computer technology) together to form a decent story. The story is a little abrupt in places, and there isn't much character development. Prey is definitely better than Jurassic Park though."
2,Weak,"It seems this book begins the decline in Crichton novels. It's not a very good SciFi adventure. I've read a few of his books and have enjoyed them in the past, but based on this one's merits and looking at State of Fear and Next, I doubt if I'll ever read a Crichton book again."
1,Crichton on the decline,Most of the characters fell flat. I found myself skipping entire sections of the novel out of boredom. Definitely not one of his best.
4,I was surprised to have loved it!,This was the first book of this kind I have ever read. And I could not put it down. I felt like I was right in the story. I really liked this book and I usually don't pick up any type of science fiction.
3,Dissappointing story,"I am a big fan of Mr. Crichton, but he failed in this novel to provide the nail biting tension typical of his earlier works. He seemed to be more interested in explaining and promoting nanotechnology and impressing the reader with his expertise in computer progamming techniques than telling a good story. This was more like a textbook set in a fictional novel. It is a good read, but wait for the paperback version."
3,"Fascinating start, but then a rerun of previous Crichton","I was completely caught up in the first half of the book. His story and character development were typical top notch Crichton. Then the last half of the book became a rerun of previous Crichton novels. Not giving anything away, but it sure seemed at times like I was reading a combination of Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park all over again."
3,"short, but interesting plot","Crichton used to be my favorite author before being replaced by Preston and Child. I like Crichton's books because they usually have an interesting premise and are enfused with technological information. Preston and Child are also able to create fascinating plots by blending historical events, biochemistry, and the supernatural. However, while Preston and Child's books seem polished with excellent character development and dialogue, Crichton's recent books have been short with thin character development and awkward dialogue. The pages are filled with blank space adding to the appearance that this is really a short story and not a novel. Crichton's books are most interesting when he describes what a character is thinking of doing and not when they are speaking. There just isn't enough of this material to justify a full length novel. The book kept my attention, but it is not Crichton's best work."
2,Crichton has Great Ideas-- POOR execution!,"Crichton writes some great books. This just isn't one of them! This was Jurassic Park with Nanomachines replacing the dinosaurs and it just didn't do much for me. Characterization was poor and after awhile, you get the impression that Crichton has never worked or been around real life people.I enjoyed Airframe because Crichton was RIGHT on about the causes 0f such accidents and the flack that surrounds a crash.I liked Timeline because he did a good job of throwing us into a good time travel yarn, which has not been done properly for many years.I liked Jurassic Park because of the ideas presented.The Terminal Man was exciting.Congo was silly, but still enjoyable.This novel was just really a sorry reason for the death of some trees. It was a waste of my time as well as Crichton's efforts."
3,"Well, it beats watching TV","Here we have another one of Michael Crichton's outings into the world of technology gone awry. It probably isn't too much of a stretch to say that if you have read one of Crichton's last several novels, you have essentially read them all. As with many of his books, we have here an essentially neutral technology creating havoc when over-reaching corporate and military types fiddle with it, a protagonist trying to warn of the dangers who is of course ignored until the situation is entirely out of hand, the requisite harrowing escapes, etc.That being said, this book is also like most of his others in that it is a fun, light read, and worth the few bucks and few hours one will invest in it."
3,Pray that Prey Never Happens,"The paperback cover quotes the New York Times Book review in part ""Terrifying . . .irresistibly suspenseful."" Indeed, the story Michael Crichton spins has elements of terror and at times the suspense grabs hold of the reader and does not let go.A tale of science run amuck on the tracks of greed and stupidity. Crichton mixes an old formula with new science.The finish is written as if the Crichton has a deadline to meet. Definitely, unsatisfying for a Michael Crichton read.Fortunately, for the reader, a bad Crichton book is better than most other authors seem able to generate on a good day.Reduce your expectations and the book will be satisfying."
5,Had the Audio Cassettes-- they were Great!!,Really- one of the bests books on tape I've had the pleasureof listening to. The story was fastpaced and downright creepy.I listened to it twice- and it made my 3 hour roundtrip commutessomething I actually looked forward to for a little while. I'lldefinately be picking up more tapes of Michael Crichton's work.
4,"I really liked this book, don't know why!!!","Well, if I could have I would have given this book 4 and half, and I wanted to take a half away for two really shallow reasons. Although I really enjoyed this book, it's fast, can't put down reading, I really had no idea what Mr. Crichton was talking about most of the time!!!!I kept asking my husband questions concerning the science in this book, and well, that aside, I really enjoyed it. The second shallow reason I took a half away, was the ending. I wanted about 2 or 3 more pages, things wrapped a little more......but that's just me, because I normally like my endings like that. So...read this book, you will enjoy it."
1,Disapointment,"Being a big fan of Crichton (Jurassic Park, TimeLine, Andromeda Strain), I was excited when this book first came out. Having just read it, I'm now glad that I didn't rush out and buy it as I almost did. There are so many things wrong with this book! My number one complaint with the book, and the only one that I will mention here, is the liberal use of the F word throughout the book. The Charlie character, who uses the F word in practically every sentence, is particularly annoying. Bottom line: dont bother with this book!"
2,The illusion of a novel,"Prey is to a novel what the ""wild swarm"" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1."
2,Not Crichton's best effort,"After reading most of Crichton's books, it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books. With such books as 'Jurassic Park', 'The Andromeda Strain', and 'Disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run.This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book.The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. It is hard to believe some of the books imagery. This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology.If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read, then this book is good. However, if you're looking for Crichton's next great novel, I didn't think this book stood up with the rest."
3,"A great state of Nano Tech update, a story dissapointment.","This refers to the unabridged Audio book. The premise is great. The research and tech updates are first rate, thorough and easy to follow. The story dissapoints with literally too much action packed into too few days for any believability. One hair raising escape after another. The lead character, a middle aged, Mr Mom, out of work programmer with three small children who doesn't exercise has no less than 6 death defying escapes from the nano's and their henchmen in one day - each causing wounds, bruising, etc... he just keeps on going. The reader's style is slow and tired - I guess because he's dictating all this first person the night of the final day. The tapes have way too many 10-15 second pauses that are irritating. I've read or listened to everything Crichton has published. This is not his best work... it could have been."
2,"Not nearly his best, Written Like a movie","This book is such a quick read, it's apparent it was put together with cinema in mind. The characters are so thinly developed, they have no substance or impact on the story.As a reader of just about all his novels, this is the most disappointing of all. However, as a reader of just about all his novels, he still got my $$$!"
4,Defenitly one of his better books,"This is defenitly one of Crichton's better books. I read it while traveling from Buffalo NY to El Paso TX, which was about 8 hours. To me the end seemed a little forced which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Up until then it is a defenite page turner that will keep you guessing and anxious to read the next page. It has some scientific mumbo jumbo but defenitly not too much to turn off those of us who aren't that scientifically inclined. Of course that's just my opnion, I could be wrong."
4,Interesting outlook on the future,"This was truly a quick read. If you want pure action and simple plot structure, this novel is for you. Crichton provides amazing details on nanotechnology and makes interesting predictions as to where we [society] might be headed with regards to it.I enjoyed reading this novel and became more interested in nanotechnology as a result. I suggest this book to anyway who likes a somewhat futuristic story with lots of action."
3,It was ok,It was ok. The plot falls short - which is disapointing because I enjoy the fact that his books are typically plot driven. Like I said it was ok - it almost seems like there were two stories going on - but you only get to hear one story. I guess that's how life usually is most of the time - so if his intent was to be realisic in that sense then he did a good job. I didn't mind his science lectures - often times they were as interesting as the story itself. It's not his best but still it's still a lot of fun.
1,Dick and Jane and Spots get Nanophobic,"This was the worst piece of writing I've ever read to the finish.I read on because I couldn't actually believe how preposterously bad it was nor believe that the score or more of blurbs in the paperback could possible be authentic. It is wooden at every level -imagination, dialogue, description. Almost every character is tediously unpleasant or else their proper name is implied to be enough to flesh them out.The world described,in dozens of instances, couldn't possible correspond to any other imagination than that of an unimaginative 12 year old boy raised solely on the worst action cartoons-in fact it could have been written by Gov. Arnold.The worst part of it is this brand-Crichton-just has to move its bowels every year or two and the product is efficiently consumed in robot fashion by millions of well trained ninnies. I highly recommend The Diamond Age as an antidote."
2,Very disappointed Crichton Fan,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with Crichton's latest offering. He does a very nice job of explaining the technology behind his premise. He describes the ""rules of the game"" as every good technothriller writer should then he breaks these rules over and over again as he tries to make the story more and more sensational. I know, you need to maintain a healthy ""suspension of disbelief"" to enjoy any book, but there was only so much I could take. The good news is that I read it from cover to cover in 5 days (which is pretty good for me!), so it had to have kept my attention, right?"
3,Moderately good story that needs editing,"Crichton tells a moderately good story, but this book needs editing. The text is too wordy, yet there is little character development. The dialogue is unnatural . Scientific information about nanotechnology is blended into tales of dishonest, scheming employers; medical risks and technology-gone-wrong, and extramarital affairs. Crichton should correct his many grammatical errors, or hire an editor to do so."
3,Oh boy...,Another gripping thriller that just doesn't cut it. I recommend it though; it's like one of those TV shows you watch as a guilty pleasure because it so mindless. Enjoy.
2,Semi-compelling,"A disappointment. While the premise of nanotechnology run amok is full of possibilities, the characters in this novel are utterly forgettable - especially the protagonist Jack. It seems that the author wanted to make sure no one was left behind in the plot development so we're left reading lowest common denominator character development. Main characters die off and....who cares? Even the other characters in the novel seem oddly unaffected by the unfolding events within the story.This book isn't horrible. There are a few moments of spooky tension but overall it's not up to Crichton's other work."
2,Swarmed over...,"Take a billion or so nano-particles, add a pinch of The Invasion of The Body Snatchers, a dash of the egg farm plus 3 rungs of the ladder escape from Aliens, 2 tablespoons of the cardboard characters in Jurassic Park, sift together with a reproducing strain from Andromeda, mix thoroughly in the Nevada desert with a pound of concept from the Forbin Project, then add pages and pages of highly technical nano-data in the spirit of A Brief History In Time...and you have PREY, Michael Crichton's latest.It is far from his best work, very derivitive, preachy at times and, if not viewed politely, could be thought of as half-baked."
2,Not so great....,"I must admit I was really not thrilled by this book at all. It was not only very predictible, but he could have left out all of the technical explainations, they were BORING and the average person would have no clue what they are talking about! Oh and the ""transfer"" thing, (those who read it will know what I am talking about) was disappointing! Man, how many times has that already been used in Sci Fi stuff!? Not only that but something about the thought of all of mankind at risk, and this guy almost being killed like three times in one day - then thinking to call his kids at home a dinnertime was a bit... I don't know, just stupid. It really took away from the moment.I had planned to buy a few more Crichton books... but I think I'll pass."
5,u need 100% entertainment?,"Why dont most people like sci-Fi novels? especially Greg Bear and Arthur.C.Clarke, because they concentrate more on science rather than entertainment. Michael Crichton is the only author who is not handicapped by this habit. One thing that is really good about crichton's novels is that you will never keep the book down in the middle. This time too, MC has not let us down. The book guarantees 100% entertainment. For those who fel that reading novels is a waste of time. I would advice you to read any MCs books as you will learn a lot about the subject than by reading a couple of scientific journals. ""Prey"" concentrates on AI, genetics and Nanotechnology. After 1/3rd of the novel, the pace picks up a speed that you would never have imagined. This is definitely not one of MC's best novels, but definitely he gives you more than you would have expected from the book. My advice is, get the hard back and have a nice time."
1,Blah! Didn't Hold My Interest at All After First Section!,"The first section of this book was good, but after that it was downhill all the way!! I had to stop reading it after a certain point, (the first 160 pages or so), as it was so boring!Prey takes us into the story of a mechanical plaque, and the desparate efforts of scientists to stop it. It speaks a lot of nantechnology and artificial disturbed intelligence.The plot was weak and never really picked up again. I wouldn't waste my money on this book!"
1,One of the worst books EVER.,"I&#65533;ve never submitted an Amazon review before, but if I can stop just ONE person from reading this piece of trash, save just ONE person from suffering through the clumsy prose of this wreck of a novel, then it&#65533;s worth speaking out.I used to look forward to a new Crichton novel every couple years. But I think Crichton&#65533;s novels have gotten progressively worse and more unreadable as the years have passed. And just when you think he&#65533;s hit rock bottom (i.e.: Timeline, Airframe, etc), along comes Prey. Prey is so awful I can&#65533;t even describe its awful awfulness to you. I&#65533;m just hoping my repeated use of the word &#65533;awful&#65533; will convey how awful this novel truly is. After finishing Prey, I decided I would never waste money on a Crichton novel again. Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I only wish that there were a &#65533;0 star&#65533; rating available."
1,Prey,I found Prey to be pretty boring and not much of a thriller. Not really entertaining because the storyline was written poorly.
2,Not that good,"I'm going to keep this review short. Just wanted to give a rating so that system is fair, meaning the ratings are not filled with all 5 star people telling you to buy it.The book was ok. Read other peoples' poor ratings."
1,the only prey is the reader!,"Mildly entertaining rubbish, about a group of nanotechnicians locked in a lab in the Nevada desert, and the scary things that can happen if we get carried away with science, and ourselves.I got about half way through the story, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED!!! I don't often tear up a book, and throw it in the trash can, but I with this horrible excuse for a thriller!Everyone knows that science, with no moral boundaries is likely to go haywire, and undo the good it was intended for, so why bother reitterating the obvious!ABSOLUTE CLAPTRAP, AND NOT WORTH THE TIME, OR MONEY IT TAKES TO GET IT, AND READ IT!Pick up, and read Timeline, instead, a much better book by Crichton!"
2,It was difficult to understand,The book went into a lot of detailled descriptions about nanotechnology that a lot of people wouldnt understand which makes the book boring
1,Anne-Marie dumped him because he can no longer write!!,"This book is just a poorly recycled version of Sphere set in the desert. It does start out pretty well in the prologue, but then just yadda yadda yadda!"
2,Nano no-no,"Books like this make you appreciate Stephen King, especially when it comes to little details like plot, characters and motivations; for instance, why does the swarm of artifical whatever designed to function as a camera suddenly start murdering anything that steps outdoors? Crichton has obviously done his homework, but the setting is pure ""Andromeda Strain,"" the plot is recycled ""Jurrasic Park,"" the text reads like a first draft with myriad inconsistences, and the dialogue makes Ken Follett sound like David Mamet. And ya gotta love the yuppie scum that's more worried about what the CEO and venture capitalists are going to think versus the carnage and moral implications of man-munching microbes. All in all, a great idea poorly executed. PS nice high school graduation photo on the back cover."
4,Another A+ book from Michael Chrichton...,"This book was a great read, fast paced and interesting. I've come to love Michael Crichton's books and this one it a keeper. Filled with action, awe-inspiring technology and suspense, this was an very interesting read. I did however, find that it didn't carry the weight that TIMELINE did, seemed to be ""too fast"" in some sections, and the technology explanation was a bit rushed not as detailed as TIMELINE or SPHERE. But over all, the book was awesome (AAA)! Buy it!"
3,Four nanostars,"Four nanostars which means three normal stars, at the beginning the book will keep you interested, but as you are reading it gets slower and slower, and as all of Crichton's books the end is to long, it could be shorter and a little bit better, another thing is that all the book could be real, but the end is just a fantasy, he could think better on how to end this book. Nevertheless Crichton is a very good writer but is very difficult to write always very good books."
2,Preyed on THE THING?,"Books started fine & with promise.Then halfway through i started getting more & more a sense of deja-vu. Hey I know this story!I suddenly realized it had morphed into a re-write of ""THE THING"" - MC just totally isolated his few stranded characters in the nevada desert instead of the arctic, created a man made menace instead of an alien, but the rest are pretty much the identical. who is friend? - who is foe?"
1,This is probably his worst book.,"This will be a quick review: This is probably his worst book. Usual Michael Crichton quality of style and character building but the subject itself was a real let down. Lower your expectations and you might enjoy it but when I pick up a Michael Crichton book, my expectations aren't low."
5,EXCITING!,"Admittedly, it has been a while since I have read this book (about 4 years), but that just testifies that it left a lasting impression on me. For me, it was the science in the book that intrigued me. The detail Crichton goes through to explain how the nano particles work was absolutely fascinating! I would not let the science aspect of this book deter any readers, though. It is a great action book that will keep you in suspense from start to finish."
2,An OK book from an author who should do better,Prey is definitely not one of Michael Crichton's better works. The science is there but the fiction makes it a bit ridiculous. Only a few days for a bunch of nano-particles to evolve into full symbiotic pirates on human bodies? Give me a break. If that happened in three days then ants would rule the world from giant ant cities ruled by massive distributed intelligence beings. Crichton doesn't convince us that 20 lines of code in a nano-particle is better than an ant.
2,Not up to snuff,"Have you ever read any other Michael Crighton novels? If you have, dont' expect the same suspense, well thought out action sequences, and character development that are usual fixtures in his works. Prey seemed like it was thrown together hastily. It's as if he didn't have a lot of time to get the book together, and this was teh finished product. The dust cover is pretty snazzy though..."
3,Mildly Interesting,"I expected more because the concept is very interesting. He did not do much with it to make it interesting. There was not enough tension. I did finish it--it did keep my interest, but it was not a book that I hated to put down. Nor was it a book I couldn't wait to pick up again."
4,Preying it would never end,"I found Prey to be a real page burner. It hooked me from the first few pages until the very last phrase. As scifi goes, the book is not of the caliber of what are in my opinion the greatest works of scifi such as Dune or the Foundation series, but Crighton manages to consistently produce novels that are both scientifically sound and engaging that echo the long gone era of classic science fiction in which science and not magic drove the plots. As forty year devotee of the genre and a faculty member who teaches a course about scifi, I highly recommend it."
2,Must have been enduring a divorce when he wrote this one!,"While the science and the 'this could happen' ethos is a lot of fun, the book's start is astoundingly mysogynystic. His protagonist goes on AT LENGTH describing the normal day hundreds of millions of mothers world wide endure as if it's something novel. His male character whines about taking care of kids, how his wife doesn't call home when she's late, how it's hard to run into former pals who still make a paycheck. Honestly, no female author could ever have gotten such tripe published, but because our protagonist is a male, this is fodder for narrative. My husband and I howled at the beginning, and simply skipped entire chapters to get to the part he's good at: telling a scary story using potentially real science. But the guy sure was ticked off at some woman when he wrote this thing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Nanocloud nasty.A science company working on nanotechnology has a problem, because of some corner cutting and the other usual corporate dodginess despite some critical advice they have a nano-organism released into the wild, and it is not a big fan of the humans that created it.A horror novel situation from there pretty much as they try and stop it and stay alive.2.5 out of 5"
3,"Prey, What I Think","Overall the book Prey was not terribly bad, but it also wasn't that good either. It wasn't boring to have to read it and it was better than some books I have read. Some of the things in the book that I liked are the fact that it seems so much more technologically advanced then this day in age. I also like the writing style and how the book was setup. Some things in the book I didn't like are how the nanobots killed people. I thought that was pretty stupid and was such a basic thing to do, especially considering how the nanobots were so smart and cunning. I also didn't like how they altered there form and how they would change and morph. By doing this, it makes the nanobots seem like a creature or animal, not a robot. They became more like an organic creature. I would recommend this book to people who are into technology and who like science because that is what the book is basically all about. Overall that's what I thought of the book."
2,Good idea gone bad,"This is another case of ""good idea gone bad,"" and it disappoints me to see this particular one performed by Crichton himself. A genius tale about microrobots evolving to the point of mimicking humanity is hindered by an unnecessarily long introduction telling the story of a stay-at-home husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him. While this does gives some hints towards the rest of the novel, it's not enough to make up for all the scenes of grocery shopping and diaper changing and the like; after all, most foreshadowing and hints are fulfulled in the last couple pages of the entire 300+ page book.There are quite a few scary scenes towards the end, and I would love to see this made into a movie (as I'm sure it will), but when it all boils down, ""Prey"" says too much and achieves too little."
3,Too sci-fi for me,This is more sci-fi than I was expecting. Not really my cup of tea but interesting concept.
1,"I ""PREY "" FOR NOT ANOTHER CRICHTON DIVORCE","Is this book just evidence to support his divorce?Does his x-wife get the rights , so he just wants to punish her?As usual , he is on the cutting edge of technology, but all he seems to want to do is write a mysogonists diatribe against women and mothers. I guess this book should be used in writing class to teach why someone going through a divorce should not write. I went to school with this 6'4 baskeball star, but all he does in this one is""dribble"" and ""foul out"".More Nano-lit than nano-tech."
1,"An interesting, if far-fetched premise with major flaws","Michael Crichton has created a unique story based on glimmerings of emerging nanotechnology with excellent action and suspense values.However, the story is fatally flawed-atleast as presented on DVD. There is a character, referred to in the beginning of the story, which uses a single flashback approach,who we find out later is actually dead at the time. Aside from this gaff,there are numerous logical flaws in the story that prove to be distracting from what otherwise could have been a riveting and thought-provoking story.One has the feeling that the author tore through the writing of this book and that the editor did likewise, perhaps both driven by commercial pressures. More care next time, please."
1,A Very Bad B-Movie Script,"That is all this book is. There are too many plot holes to even mention here. The dialouge is terrible and he sums up the plot lines after each interaction like a soap opera would. The book had a great idea and the book needed to be technical, which is great, but he dumbs everything down to a 5 year old reading level. Wait for the movie and you might be able to see some cool special effects, but don't expect anything you haven't seen before."
1,Forget the hype...,Disappointing page turner. Thin characters and totally improbable situations make this most recent Crichton scifi effort a waste of time. At least wait until the paperback comes out; save your money even with the generous Amazon.com promotion.
1,Calling Commander La Forge . . .,I really enjoyed this plot when I saw it on STAR TREK TNG a decade ago . . . This is a far cry from the originality he displayed in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. Futuristic stories that are based on humanity like in the novel CLONED LOVE is the road to originality in the sci-fi world. This novel fails to bridge that gap.
2,LIKE PAINTING BY NUMBERS,"Crichton's premise of nanotechnology gone awry is interesting but not necessarily new and his characters are shallow and one dimensional. I found the first hundred pages tolerable but the remainder of the book to be formalistic.The science of the ""black cloud swarm"" requires way too much information and takes away from what could have been a good sci fi horror story.Much of the book reads as if it was originally written as a screenplay. Skip the book and wait for the movie that will, no doubt, be coming to a theatre near you in the future."
3,been done before,"Frank Herbert did this plot a lot better 30 years ago in a novel called ""The Green Brain"". A decent read, but as predictable as all Crichton's novels."
3,"What could have been, but wasn't...","The title ""Prey"" is, presumably, derived from the ""predatorprey"" programming used to create swarms of predatory particles on behalf of the United States Military. In short, things get out of hand and the particles esacpe into the surrounding desert [bad subcontractors] only to adapt to - and take advantage of - the surrounding environment as they kill everything in sight. The problem is, the action takes place in such a limited area, involving so few people that the novel loses its punch. Granted, the concept worked well for a very similarly themed screenplay, ""The Thing,"" but swarms of collectively intelligent - and malicious - nanoparticles just screams FULL SCALE ATTACK ON MAJOR URBAN CENTER. I can see the U.S. Special Forces playing cat-and-mouse with an elusive enemy that contines to outmanuever them...and so on. Unfortunately, I wasn't in on the plot-making process. My suggestion: Wait until the book comes out in paperback."
4,Nanoscare,"Red Herring chose a nanotech backlash as a trend for 2003, and mentioned Prey. It was compared to Jurassic Park and its impact on biology. I would read the Foresight guidelines on nanotech safety, and David Forrest's initial guidlines, written in 1988.Good read, but consider the upside."
2,Not Crichton's best work,"An interesting concept, and as believable as always, but much of the book consisted of Crichton over-explaining his theory, resulting in long dull patches interspersed throughout an otherwise good story."
1,Windy,"So much exposition, so little patience. This book annoyed me. I borrowed this book from my brother, expecting another Jurassic Park. Instead, I got some sort of diary. It seems forced, and dry, I didn't like the book at all."
2,DULL & PREDICTABLE,"This is not Michael Crichton's best work. An interesting idea, but not very well fleshed out or expanded. I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife. So who cared if she became infected."
3,Half way there,"Very good idea, lots of creativity. Unfortunately the book got lost into the technical creativity. Characters lack depth, many ideas are not pushed far enough. An OK book that will teach you nothing about nanotech."
3,Intriguing but Profanity-laced,"This book had a great story and played up the intensity well, but what's up with all the heavy swearing, especially the f-bomb? As they say, profanity is used by those with a limited vocabulary. Truly great authors can come up with other words of expression to convey the emotion - e.g. Terry Brooks, Frederick Forsyth, Stephen Ambrose and others. Timeline had this same problem. Instead of adding to the story, the profanity detracts from it. Also, Crichton's conclusions are always too quick and don't explain enough, like when certain pivotal events happened."
2,"Wow, you're smart","Thanks Michael, for showing us how brilliant you are. Now stop breaking down nanotechnology and start remembering why we like you....IT'S THE WRITING SILLY! All of your booksmart ""look at the research i did"" is good to an extent, but man, remember the characters we care about, not the science. I think this one was too far unbalanced with science and research...i only made it to page 170.Don Donahue"
1,dull,its long and boring. Crichton has the Tom Clancy problem - too little story for the number of pages.
1,Dreading the inevitable movie,"A subpar effort, not nearly as good as Crichton's earlier work (Sphere, Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park). The characters are one-dimensional, poorly developed when developed at all. The premise of nanotechnology is a fascinating one, and ripe for science fiction, but not particularly believable as forced into the ""technological boogeyman"" role in this novel. It seems to me now that Crichton has built a large audience, his works are becoming more cookie-cutter and predictable, written with the inevitable blockbuster movie version in mind.For a much more imaginative, well-written, and believable look at how nanotechnology might shape the world of the future, and a great story to boot, I recommend Neal Stephenson's ""The Diamond Age."""
1,rehash-retread,I waited for the release of this book with such anticipation and was so let down. There wasn't an iota of originality and no cutitng edge sci fi tale told. This was the most disappointing read of my life and it is from an author that I've loved all my life so that made it worse. I ended up reading my sister's new favorite book Cloned Love.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book stunk. I always finish books I start; but, this one was torture to get through. Crichton has to stop the ""action"" during almost every chapter to explain some non-sensical and ultimately irrelevant scientific concept. The main character alternates between monumentally stupid, then genius, then stupid again. It was very frustrating.Don't believe the good reviews of this book. They must have been written by the Publisher or one of Crichton's relatives. Trust me and skip this one."
1,disappointed,"not much to say, his most recent book is the most disappointing yet, and i have read them all. the overlay of the house dad dealing with his children's problems while saving the world is just silly. the technical stuff too technical for the average reader, i think.I probably will not buy his next one."
1,Boring and Predictable,"I had trouble getting through thi book, and I would agree that it seems to be written more like a screenplay than a typical Crichton novel. I was very disappointed with this book, both because it was clearly written to be a movie, and it seemed to be Jurassic Park in a new environment - evil genetically enhanced creatures attacking humans who (shock) are trapped in an isolated compound. The story was all too predictable and familiar to be entertaining."
3,"Good idea, Lacking substance","This was the first novel I read by Crichton and overall it was pretty good. The concept of nanotechnology is very interesting. I have also read By Light of the Moon by Dean Koontz which dealt with nanotechnology but in a different way. The major complaint I had was with the whole focus on the narrator's family life. Although it played a role in the plot, I felt it went too deep into it and took away from the story. Also, the I didn't like the way the author portrayed the kids. The kid's behavior didn't seem real life, the name calling was something an adult might imagine children saying to each but in reality don't. And after awhile it just got annoying reading about them. I gave it three stars because of the idea and also the second half of the novel was better than the first half."
1,A complete waste of your time,This ranks as one of the worst books I've ever purchased.It ramples with shallow characters. The writing is just terrible. At one point a group of characters runs around acting like birds (they're seriously attempting to avoid getting killed) in an attempt to fool the Prey.Don't buy it!
1,Jurassic dot meets the andromeda strain vs the stepford wife,"Crichton has always been tops with his scientific savvy and vision of the future but, Christ has he run out of story ideas. Hasn't he done this before. His super beings are destroyed a little too conveniently to tie up this [weak] novel. Can't you just see this was written as a screenplay, not a novel. Get James Cameron to direct. You can use left over effects from The Abyss and deleted scenes from The Swarm. Won't cost much. Any d-rate actor could act out this crud.Skip it."
2,Ordinary,"People are taken over by nanobots. Then it's up to the hero to outwit the nanobots (which shouldn't be difficult since they blow away in a stiff breeze). And that's about it, folks. The plot of Prey is recycled from the endless ""people are taken over by aliens"" stories that have been around forever. The characters are stock: Crichton doesn't bring them alive, and if they were alive, you wouldn't want to know them because they're so dull. A couple of action scenes -- characters battling swarms of nanobots -- are lively, but the rest of the prose is flat. Crichton had some interesting ideas about nanobots but lacked the originality to do sufficiently interesting things with them to make the story worthwhile. The novel might be okay -- just okay -- as a fast beach read, but there are better options. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if Amazon made that option available."
4,Enjoyable summer vacation read,"I read this book this past summer on vacation. I liked it. The content is pure Crichton in it's detailed description of the science and technology behind the story. I found it to be a ""page turner"". It was a fast read, I finished it in about a week, and it made for great summer vacation reading."
3,Ok but not great,Pretty engaging but the ending felt very contrived. It could have been much better.
3,Predictable,What's obvious to the reader it's however extremely hard for the main character to discover. The story does keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Not the kind of sci-fi I enjoy the most.
4,"Good reference, not a play aid","With the GURPS Basic Set, Steve Jackson, the designer of GURPS, went a long way towards making a coherent magic system for a generic fantasy RPG. However, as Mr. Bonewits points out, it has little, if anything, to do with the way most people modern or past think about magic. Authentic Thaumaturgy is, if nothing else, an interesting read about the author's take on describing how a GM might design a ""realistic"" magic system for any game system, not just GURPS. He talks in depth about how people, past and present, view magic and how it really works, and points out that, for some, it really is a religion or way of life not to be taken lightly. The only real problem is that the book makes no real attempt to provide good examples of how that might be done for a full system -- it is left as an exercise for the reader."
1,Garbage,"Kat williams is not funny. dude is a weak comedian. he has no jokes&just rambles on&on. he might get over with a line here&there,but there is nothing funny about his routine.I watch his HBO show&was bored big time. cliche jokes&the usual digs&Words that a Cat who can't articulate his brand of humor well has to resort to. the biggest joke is the Network that gave him a special to begin with. dude is Corny."
3,"Repeat, repeat, repeat . . .","This unfortunately is just a reproduction of his 1st stand-up comedy DVD. Same jokes simply repeated! So, I was disappointed because I thought I was going to hear new jokes and/or different material he was introducing. What's so sad, I just paid $ to see him live in concert on Long Island and he told 75% of the jokes on this DVD. Now that's a huge waste of my money. Katt is hilarious... he needs to write some ""NEW"" material and stop promoting this OLD stuff we all heard to many times over. Don't worry, I'm keeping a positive attitude that the best is yet to come again."
5,Breath Taking Funny !!!!!!,"He has done it again, over and over again, time and time again, don't watch this comedy if you are pregnant, my water almost broke ""Laughing""!TOO DIE FOR, A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!"
5,Hysterically funny,"Absolutely hilarious!!! I've watched this stand-up numerous times. Expect to start laughing from the moment Katt Williams takes the stage in his bright green suit. He discusses everything from being shot to Michael Jackson climbing trees in Neverland. The only other time I laughed this hard was when I watched Chris Rock's ""Bring the Pain."""
5,Too funny,One of those laugh till you cry acts. Katt is no doubt one of the funniest I have seen in a LONG time. He keeps it real and I couldnt stop laughing. Its a must!
4,Good introduction to the lizard,"Fascinating information regarding early envenomations in the American West, a good bibliography, and wonderful introduction to the subject suitable for any naturalist."
2,promotes misconceptoins of the lizard,"The overall content of the book was good and easily readable, but especially on the cover the authors stated some out and out untruths about the Gila Monster. The Gila Monster is not the only lizard with a forked tongue or with an armored hide as the authors stated. The varanids and teiids also have forked tongue and at least some have armored hides. I tend to disagree with a few other comments made in the book, but at present these are just my opinions and need more research before I can justify an argument against them. The book was interesting, but have some suspicion when reading as to whether or not it is all correct."
3,"Great film, but why on earth in 1.33?","I echo another's complaint. OK, it's cheap ($6.10 from DDDVD) but I would gladly pay more for a widescreen version as made. Almost the first thing you see before it starts is ""Filmed in Panavision"". But that's not what you get on this DVD. Pity. Any hope for a second shot by Universal?"
4,Cool Matthau Film.,"Another classic action film that seems to go relatively unknown. Matthau is a stunt pilot and thief who pulls off a great caper against the Mob. Joe Don Baker is also terrific as the nasty heavy sent to kill Matthau. Smart, well written, with a good twist to end it all. Recommended. If you like Matthau and Don Siegel (Dirty Harry, et al) this is a winner."
4,But which aspect ratio?,"This is a fine little film, and highly recommended. But it is in the same Universal release series as Colossus: The Forbin Project, which is apparently only being released in full-screen. Amazon has no info on the aspect ratio of this film, which deserves to be seen in its original format. We need to stand up to studios that release films in FS, and then try to sell it again the following year in WS. This is a cynical exploitation of consumers."
2,"""Old"" should command more respect","I agree with the strong emotional orientation of other reviewers of this ""full-screen"" disc. I don't see why this Walter Matthau movie has not been released on disc before in its original format ... It is a great story, and to release it in a fore-shortened format (AND NO CAPTIONS, EITHER) invites the criticism of stupidity. In this vein, I would like to point out that in general the market for these older movies is getting older and older, and for some of us the extra cost of a quality production is well worth it. I can assure whoever it is that makes the selections of what to produce, the younger generation is only sparsely interested to see, let alone buy, movies older than the youngster. Please attend to these older movie productions in a quality manner while you still have any market for them left."
3,Cheesy DVD,"I'm not discouraging anyone from purchasing this (that's why I gave it 3 stars) but I don't believe it is possible to put any less on a DVD. The one I received had no menu, it just started upon insertion and ran continuously until removed from the player (when it reached the end it just went back to the beginning). It was also a low quality pan and scan version. I remember how much I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and I still enjoy seeing it so I hope that eventually a better version will become available."
3,decent 70s file,"This is actually a decent 70s film. Joe Don Baker does a good job as a mob enforcer that is menacing and heartless. I was reading the synopsis of ""No Country for Old Men"" and I immediately thought of this movie."
3,"Good start, slow middle, good end.",This is a great little film from a genre I love. It could have been presented in better restored condition..(is this really the origonal format ?).. but it is still a must have in my opinion.
1,Not even as good as Rockford Files,"The plot summary sounded like a lot of fun: Walter Matthau running from the Mob.But the movie was a huge-let down. It was poorly paced and the script was worse than mediocre. With such uninspiring fare, even Matthau couldn't make it interesting. There's a scene with Matthau flying a plane that could have been spectacular but due to poor writing and poor pacing it fell flat. I can't say more to avoid a spoiler, but let's just say it was excruciatingly predictable.The overall feel is like an episode of the Rockford Files, but not nearly as well done. I'd watch an old Rockford Files episode any day over this movie! I watched it once and gave it to the thrift shop."
1,I hope Universal listens to the many complaints,"I love this film, and wanted to added to my dvd collection; however, after reading the many complaints regarding the poor quality of the dvd, I am going to wait until Universal puts out a better copy"
1,"Five Star Movie, Stellar Cast, Disgraceful release format",I totally subscribe to the views expressed by many reviewers. This is a travesty of a release. Charley Varrick is a superb film with a cult status only because it has never been adequately presented or marketed. I bought this in advance of its release on the bizarrely timed date at the end of december 2004 (Have the marketing department never heard of Christmas?) and I was thoroughly disappointed. The print looks like a bad 70's piece of television and the ratio is the same. This film was shot and screened in the cinemas as a panavision 1:85 or wider ratio. Who wants to look at something that doesn't reflect its true worth? Don't buy this even though it is a great film. Wait until someone wakes up and does a proper job!
1,"A ""fool screen"" version? May it burn.","I've waited a few years for ""Varrick"" to come out on DVD.And now that it did come out, I will not buy it.That is because I do not enjoy watching 60% of a film. When the studio halfwits realize that only brain damaged in-duh-viduals want to see the cut, blurred by panning-and-scanning full screen version, and when they decide to release ""Varrick"" in a proper, widescreen version instead - *then* I will purchase a copy. As for this one, I would not want it for free."
1,A five star film gets a one star rating,"Great film, messed up by pan and scan -- avoid and wait for the Panavision version"
5,DVD report,"Everyone knows this is a great film, and in my opinion it gets better with every viewing. The plot is surprisingly intricate, and there is no dialogue explaining what is going on -- a true rarity.But what about the DVD? I bought it, after delaying for a long time because of the angry reviews re fullscreen versus widescreen. And, indeed, I wish the DVD had a glorious widescreen print. But it is great anyway. It seems obvious that the film was shot fullscreen, since there is not a single shot that seems awkward. No pan-and-scan. No shots of one person on the screen when there should be two. No half heads. Moreover, the 'extra' material on the top and bottom of the screen never looks awkward. It looks like it was composed for full screen presentation. The picture is very nice. There is nothing to distract you from the very fine film.To anyone who is hesitating over this purchase for purely technical reasons I recommend that you hesitate no longer."
3,Very violent,"The acting is good, there is a story, the movie keeps your interest, but it is very violent with many distressing scenes. It is not a caper movie, like Hopscotch, made 7 years later and also starring Walter Matthau. I don't mean this as a criticism, but as a warning to those like me who do not enjoy fictional violence (there's enough real violence in the world, no need to invent any). One thing for sure: the New Mexico tourist bureau did not sponsor this movie."
5,Really good movie!!,"All the reviews aside, this a good movie, and I enjoy it every time I watch it. I'd call it a sleeper. Walter Mathheau is great as always."
4,Charlie: A smart thinking thief avoids death by thugs,"My husband has seen this movie twice on TV...Never seems to tire of it. So I bought it as part of his birthday gift. It is a clever movie with a exciting surprise ending. It is laced with a particular humor which is hard to discribe, The supporting actors play their rolls very well. Two ordinary thieves rob a small bank & much to their suprise they stumble upon a bag with huge amount of money. Charlie is suspicious...why is a small bank holding all this money unless....it is being laundered. The hunt begins. I assure you the timing is great in this movie and you'll will stay with it to the very end."
2,Only if you like Walter Matthau,"I only recommend this movie to those who are fans of Walter Matthau (which I am). The script is fair at best, the directing is lackluster and corny, and Matthau's supporting actors in this movie seem distracted or half-hearted (except Joe Don Baker who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag). If you are not familiar with Walter Matthau, there are other choices which have better writing and directing, and far better acting by the supporting cast.The DVD itself has two major problems: 1) it's a 4:3 pan and scan; and the sound track is ""noisy."" The ""focus"" and other visual problems are not as apparent as other reviews might suggest."
2,... more like a bad 70s made for tv movie,"Cheesy music, hitman story, crummy sets and locations. Matthau is pretty good, but the story is not engaging or convincing as clever suspense. There are bunches on non-sequiters and for a movie that wears nearly 2 hours the plot is pretty thin.Supposedly Charlie is some kind of rebel hero, but the script never convinces us he's more than a selfish thug himself. Overall, a misstep for Matthau because the story wasn't good enough for him to take on this dark character. Fairly cheesy overall. Thumbs down."
2,Not about monkeys,"The title is a bit of a rip-off. I bought the book sight unseen because like many I am fascinated with the idea of a pet monkey. I thought that a veterinarian would have some fascinating insider information on monkeys. Well after using it as the clever title the author only mentions monkeys in the preface in two short paragraphs. We learn that they bite and they smell they throw feces and owners of them love them anyway. We also learn that vets would rather deal with a spitting cobra than a monkey. The author than promises that later she will reveal how vets hold monkeys safely to inspect them. Well, a page by page examination of the book yields no further reference to monkeys and her promise is left unfulfilled.Besides that I must agree with the reviewer that was disgusted by her microwaving a cat to conceal her lies to the owner.I guess a vet that is willing to lie to a cat owner wouldn't hesitate to mislead her potential readers to sell books as well."
1,And People Still RESPECT Veterinarians??,"As a veterinary student, I was appalled to read that such antics as lying to clients and microwaving cats not only seem to be acceptable, but touted as entertainment in this book! It certainly made me happy that I did not choose to pursue my education at Washington State University if this is any representation the quality of their instruction!"
2,Not Sachs,"I just ordered two of these ""hurry only 2 left"" shocks.First of all Sachs is not Boge.Boge is owned by ZF. Sachs is another company, and these are not Sachs. I was sent Boge.Second, the year of my car 1989 requires Gas shocks, not regular. I assumes that the seller knew the requirements of my car when I looked it up on their Amazon page.Now, thanks to Amazon, i've got Sachs Gas shocks on the front, and Boge regulars on the rear.:("
1,look elsewhere-insruction vacant.,This book has many flaws and confusing oversites. Look elsewhere for instruction. I recommend THE LANGUAGE OF MEDICINE by Davi-Ellen Chabner. A total improvement.
1,Dont buy this,"This is least helpful thing I have ever purchased. I am supposed to put together a two day lesson plan for my peers in my class, my teacher suggested an online teaching guide and this seemed perfect. I guess this would be perfect if I was teaching 2nd graders or maybe chimpanzees. I guess I was hoping for a little more creativity, but apparently modern education is governed by robots who have no human emotions, and whose only desire is to bore students into a coma and then steal their souls. If you actually use this study guide I can only pray that your students plan a mutiny, and run you out of secondary education for the rest of your sad existence on this planet."
4,"MY Daddy Drives a UFO, Too!","This LP contains ""Mystery Plane"", one of the greatest rock songs ever scratched on vinyl. And the rest of the songs are pretty hair-raisingly enjoyable as well. This album is like a fine Scotch whiskey... if you have the taste for it you can't do without it. This may be the greatest pure rock and roll band that ever was for those of us who were born between 1955 and 1960. B-grade horror movies, rockabilly, road houses and the dark underbelly of the city and the outlying areas, and, of course, the fine line between mental illness and genius... these are a few of their favorite things. If you never saw them live in their prime, you'd better hope someone creates a time machine soon, 'cause you MISSED IT. I'm the Big Oh, and I gotta go."
4,makes Stray Cats look like wimps,Link Wray rules w/his 80's pyscho-reincarnation in the Cramps--the guitar distortion effects of GARBAGEMAN are worth the price of admission alone!
4,"Wild, steamy, freaky, funky, groovy and bad!","The dark side of rockabilly! The Cramps take good ol' rockabilly and makes it rabid and raunchy. ""Fever"" is HOT, the guitar work is super, Lux Interior is the dark Elvis. I also enjoy the smirky humor of these songs; without it, you might think that they took themselves and their music too seriously. By the way, they're fantastic in concert, ya gotta see 'em!"
4,File Under Sacred Music,"From the opening riffs of ""TV Set"" to the psyched out cover of the old torch-jazz classic ""fever"" this album comes out swinging and doesn't let up.Rockabilly and Psychobilly fans alike should have a good time with this one."
5,Orphic Mystery,"Still my favorite Cramps album, for it contains my favorite Cramps cover of The Sonics' ""Strychnine."" This is rock-a-billy, punk, garage, lo-fi production, and vocals straight out of the gothic school of Screamin' Jay Hawkins.But it is better than all that and transcends that from which it was born.Probably difficult to overstate how influential this album is, and the lame ""you had to be there"" is inadequate. For both The Cramps and DEVO were products of Ohio, low rent art scenes, and desperation to smash back at the sludge coming from the payola radio of 1970s America. What is ironic is the Cramps were accused of embracing a cartoonish version of Satanic theatrics as part of their image, while meanwhile head-banger music as ludicrous as a spandex pentagram was chronicled with precision and admiration by CREAM.For anyone starting a band and considering your placement in the pantheon of rock genre, this is a must listen."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm not usually one to give very negative feedback, but this purchase was a waste of our money.This training CD gives you no reason for what they are doing during the tutorials, no definition of what various processes mean, or how you could use any of the functions in your own work. It speaks using a text-to-speech computer voice, so it's mind-numbing to listen to, and the video quality is sometimes difficult to view.Furthermore, the lessons are pieced together (possibly from prior versions?) so not all of the sequences are in order and occasionally the file names are incorrect.I am going to buy the Total Training DVD's and count this purchase as a loss."
2,Laverne & Shirley: Fifth Season Disappointments,"I always was a fan of Laverne & Shirley. Purchased each season as soon as it was available.Season 5 is definitely when the series started to tank. I forgot that towards the end of the show's run, the writing and acting got progressively worse.My recommendation, buy Series 1-4 and skip the rest."
3,Starting to jump the shark,"I love this series, especially the first four seasons. However although there are a few good episodes on season 5, as a whole, I could have skipped it. The slapstick is bit over kill and it is loud and annoying. Also Big Rosie has no episodes and she was fantastic as Lavernne's foyl. Love Rosie!! She should have been in more episodes.This is the last season that takes place in Milwaukee... the California seasons are useless. I cannot give a stellar review for this set. It lacked the magic of the first three seasons,,, even season four kinda waned, but as a big fan over all of the chemistry between Cindy and Penny, I had to give it a shot."
5,Fun with Electronics!,"This book is for the beginner that wants to get into electronics and has heard that the Stamp is a pretty cool thing. The book starts out with an introduction to the Stamp and Electronics in general. From this, the user is given more detail on the Basic Stamp. The majority of the book is dedicated to the projects presented in the book and this is where I learned the most about the Stamp. The projects focus on interfacing to other devices and this is where the book really shines."
1,"Great book, lousy publisher.","Sadly, although this book is great, I do NOT suggest that you purchase it. The description of the book claims that there is a CDROM enclosed. Sadly, there isn't. The book also claims that you can ""download all the files that would be on the CDROM from their FTP site"". Yet another issue, because the publisher was acquired some months back, and their FTP site is GONE! Several attempts to address this issue with the publisher, the author, and Amazon have gone without resolving the issue. It's sad, because it's a great book."
1,Rip-Off,"Sorry, the review system will not let me assign the proper rating of zero stars.I must agree with Mr. Kvochick's previous review. Might be a good text, but it is falsely advertised and I won't be keeping it long enough to find out. None of the promised software is either included with the book nor available anywhere for download. I'll be returning the book and refraining from purchasing anymore of Mr. William's work.Under the circumstances, this book should be sold as a $5 cut-out!"
4,Delicious Snack,"DELICIOUSSS!!! the only reason why it is a 4/5 stars is because even though the bag is resealable, i noticed the mangoes would go a little hard and stale if i didnt finish eatting them after a few days."
2,"Over-sweetened now, like all the other dried mangoes.","I used to rave about these Philippine Brand Dried Mangoes, they tasted so amazing, so unlike all the other over-sugared brands.However, my last order was 10 times better than this last one. It seems they've succumbed to the add-insane-amounts-of-sugar crowd.These used to be great, now they taste just like all the other dried mangoes - they even crunch when you bite into the crystallized sugar.I'll miss them."
5,brilliant songwriting,Jez Lowe is an amazing songwriter who writes his own British Isles folk tunes that sound like old traditional songs as handed down by Elvis Costello. A delight for fans of Celtic music and singer/songwriters alike. A great record.
2,Detestable Pain,"We used this car seat briefly because we were traveling and our hosts borrowed it from a friend.It posed one difficulty that marks it as near useless. I doubt the waist buckle was designed by anyone who has ever buckled a child into a car seat. They have a design that somebody probably thought was clever but is actually a pain to latch/unlatch. They also didn't align properly so it always seemed as though one side wasn't properly latched (note: this might have been a problem with our specific seat, but I doubt it).I want a buckle that I can latch in freezing weather and unlatch in an emergency. This satisfied neither requirement.Aside from that -- which is also why I give it more than a star -- it was okay. It seemed heavier than most car seats but I liked the heavy duty handle. We secured the main part with a seat belt so I can't comment on the base portion and connecting to that.Buy a Graco instead. We love ours."
3,There must be a better carseat out there...,"This is my first baby, so not much to compare it to...but there are a few annoyances with this carseat. 1. the straps are constantly getting twisted. 2. The handle release buttons are very tight and hard to move back easily to get baby out. 3. the handle doesn't lend itself well to attaching/dangling toys. 4. Wish the canopy was slightly larger to cover baby more efficiently when it's raining or for filtering out sunlight. 5. the adjustibility of the straps is not as easy as it should be.On a more positive note...I like that it's lightweight, easy to carry, easy to snap onto it's base and install base into car, easy to snap onto the snap n go stroller that BabyTrend makes. The upholstery is nice looking and wipes off easily. Many people have remarked they think it looks like a Chicco carseat.But I can't help but wonder if there might be a better carseat out there."
4,good car seat,I purchased two of these because I had twins and they have been good car seats. The one thing that frustrated me was that the handles are very difficult to release so that you can get the babies out.
4,Love the handle,I love the triangular handle on this car seat. Only down side is the buttons on the side of the handle are a little hard to push when you want to slide the handle back to put baby in/take baby out. But it snaps into the car in a flash and my little guy is very comfortable in it.
2,Good looking but not safe!,"I recently bought this carseat and when I got it I thought it would be perfect. When I tried to install it was when I found the first problem. Putting the seat in the correct height to have it level proves to be near impossible unless you are very strong. Raising and lowering it by the little button the base is very difficult. After I got that figured out and got it installed by a certified person, I thought I was going to be done with it until I had the baby. I didn't pay any attention to it for a couple of days and when I was putting stuff in the backseat I noticed that one of the LATCH clasps was undone. I couldn't figure out why this would have happened but didn't think anything of it and just hooked it back on. By the time I had driven home, less than 10 minutes, it was unclipped again. No one seemed to be able to tell me why this was happening, I'm just glad that my baby isn't here yet! I'm returning this one and I don't think I'll ever look at a Baby Trend again!"
4,Outstanding recipe resource,Very Very little in this boon on the how-to of wine making but if you're an experienced wine maker and you're looking for a recipe book for mead and wine this is the one to get. Tons of stuff.
3,Not what I was expecting,"From the title, I was expecting this book to be along the same lines as ""Wild Fermentation,"" by Sandor Ellix Katz. It wasn't.There are about three paragraphs in this book that discuss wild fermentation (i.e. fermenting wine with nothing but the wild yeast in the atmosphere), and those paragraphs contained several inaccuracies (for example, wild yeast exists everywhere, not just on the skins of grapes, and these yeasts will ferment anything containing sugar, not just grape juice).This book wasn't by any means bad, it just wasn't what I thought it would be."
2,Unnatural chemicals and additives,"I really didn't like how there are so many unnatural additives and chemicals in all the recipes. I can't imagine drinking a finished product knowing those things are in it especially since classic recipes using herbs, fruit, and/or flowers would not have included the unnatural additives they recommend."
3,Honest book,"The title says exactly what you will find in it, a series of recipes of wild wines, flower wines and so on. Many ideas came out of it. It deserves some attention."
4,Making Wild Wines & Meads,In reviewing this book it appears to be well thought out and certainly has a very broad selection of recipes. Unfortunately I have yet to be able to try concocting any of the recipes.
2,Not very wild,"The title suggest ""wild recipes"" and I thought that recipes would be presented which you can make mainly with wild or backyard ingredients, maybe even using wild yeasts. Instead it is a pretty usual wine making book. Nearly all recipes ask for fruit juice concentrate, even for very unusual concentrates. I have no idea where to get these concentrates, certainly not in the next supermarket.For this reason, I think that the title is very misleading as it suggests real ""back to the basic"" recipes."
5,SOFT CELL IN TAKE-NO-PRISONERS MODE WITH ESSENTIAL EXTRAS,"this is something of a companion album to 'this last night in sodom' in that they both have more 'marc and the mambas' elements than the other soft cell works. if this is a less menacing collection than 'this last night..' it's not by much. equal parts charging and angry as it is sympathetic and broken this was an utterly genuine time for soft cell who seemed to be intent on stripping off any previous gloss and cleanliness to reveal the drug-infused mania that is this album. the fact that the (what was a bonus vinyl 12"") EP including the Hendrix covers AND the absolutely essential 'it's a mugs game' are here make this possibly the most important soft cell collection to own."
4,Lixit Wide Mouth Water Bottle - 1/2 Gallon Rabbit,The bottles arrived very fast which was great. Although they work fine we couldn't seem to get them to stop dripping no matter what we tried.
2,Misleading Picture,I was not happy with this purchase because the picture givin on the site and the actual product received are 2 different items. The picture is of a round water bottle (which is what I needed) the item I received is a rectangular water bottle. I already have a holder for a round bottle and just wanted a bigger bottle for same holder. Haven't figured out what I'm gonna do with rectangular one yet. I decided to just keep it because it's not worth the shipping and hassle to send it back. BTW...the rectangular bottle itself is a good bottle...just not what I ordered I dont think (same size but different shape).
5,I have been trying to retrace this book for the last 5 years,"After having read the book, and having lent it to several friends and relatives, I have never been able to forget about dear Fungle. I was so enchanted by this lovely, cunning creature that I even named one of my cats after him. Why oh why isn't this book available anymore!"
1,waste... go see the bleep,"I unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was one of the worst of them.. pure waste of money. if you've seen ""what the bleep"" dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds.."
5,Rene Furterer is a light weight cream rinse,"Great product. Light weight cream rinse. Makes for shiny hair. Not a deep conditioner. Fast delivery. I would order again , even though the product is a bit expensive."
1,Poor Job,"I am appalled by the egregious errors committed in trying to reprint this beautiful book, which should be of considerable interest to Newman scholars, especially those who are concerned with his views on education and with his service as founding rector of the Catholic University in Ireland. I recently purchased a copy of this book only to discover that it is simply useless; despite its high cost. The print is unseasonably tiny, but, above all, the words are so horribly mangled in many of its pages that it lacks any real intellectual value. Luckily for me, I have access to an 1896 edition of the book, which the publisher should have simply filmed and printed exactly as it is. This copy is elegant, agreeable to the eyes, and, despite its age, a delight to read. The publisher had better repeated this very badly executed project."
1,repeat photos,Dont get this book. They show the same restaurants over and over. Nothing really worth looking at. Lighting is the same in each and every restaurant. I am an architect looking for different uses of materials this book is not it. It you see one restaurant here you can see them all.From 1 to 10 I would give this book a 5.
3,"Well done, but lacking flair","Nice photography, printing, etc., but many of the empty-room interior photos cried out for people! Part of the excitement of the venue are the people enjoying it. Some photos were pretty self-explanitory, but others could have used a complete naritive."
3,This is a very good book to learn how to calculate,"This book together with the book by Mathews and Walker , Mathematical methods of Physics, really teach you to calculate.It is not a book on theory. It is a book that will teach you what to do to solve an integral eqaution or even to calculate some difficult integral. It is Very Good and I meant to give it five stars."
2,A cut that's a little too deep,"I have been searching for a good cutting board for a while and I own 3 other boards (wood, glass and plastic). I was hoping that I would use this only for cutting raw meat, but after couple uses, the board was covered with rough cuts marks. I don't think it will affect the functionality but I am concerned with the plastic residue that might end up in my food. I guess I just have to wash the meat after I finish cutting it. A little disappointed!"
5,Great non-slip cutting board,"This board truly will not slide, anywhere! The offside of this is that you can only use one side, but I'd rather have it not slip than be a dual sided cutting board. I've been using this board since November of 2007, and thus far, it has held up great. I have run mine through the dishwasher with no problems. This is a great cutting board for the price."
3,"Yep, it warps in the dishwasher","I, too, bought this cutting board on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated, primarily because CI said it was dishwasher safe. We've had it for a bit over a year now, and after admittedly routine dishwasher runs (it's our primary cutting board), it has indeed warped -- not such that it is unusable. However, it does move around so much that the backing that was supposed to hold it in place is not of much use.For the money, it's not terrible. But for those of us looking for a decent, non-warping, dishwasher safe, inexpensive board... plan to buy a new one every six months or so, or invest in a more expensive board."
4,Perfect for my needs.,If you are a semi-handyman you can get this part and install it yourself instead of paying someone $$$$ to install it for you. After all the guy will order this anyway as you did and you will end up paying through the nose.
4,SF,The Toy is going to be a collectors item. I have many of these. Has many accessories to it. I haven't even opened the item yet for collectors purposes. Great Buy.
3,"You'll feel WAY ""south of hope"" reading depressing novel","Jon Hassler is a highly talented, deeply engrossing novelist, sensitive and understanding. But to say this book is a downer is putting it mildly. Hassler's ""Simon's Night"" and ""A Green Journey"" tie for my favorite Hassler novels, with his first novel, ""Staggerford,"" coming in at a close second. I just wish he'd lighten up a bit, and give a little more warmth and coziness -- in the hands of a skilled writer such as Hassler, those qualities don't always mean ""saccharine"" and ""lightweight.""But I can't stress enough that Hassler is, indeed, a VERY skilled storyteller, and certainly worth your time."
5,Great Resource to Improve your health,"Steve Ilg is an interesting character and an incredibly fit man. I have been working out for 15 years, but when I tried some of the programs in this book--they tested my will! Its a terrific book to give an athlete new training ideas. The concept of changing your training routine it really useful. How many of us fall into the routine of doing the same thing over and over again? Of course, Ilg's merging of the spiritual, intellectual and physical is also awesome."
4,A love story to remember,"An emotionally-gripping love story that tugs at your heart and makes you want to keep turning the pages until the end. Grant Wadsworth represnts the typical contemporary working man who wants to provide for his family to the extent of becoming a workaholic. But when his family is threatened, he recognizes the importance of his wife and child and becomes a hero to remember!"
2,Romantic suspense?,"This is a pretty average romance novel. I would pick it up at a UBS. Then I saw it was supposed to be a romantic suspense. In that case, it is disappointing. Little action and a silly mystery. Gayle Wilson and Suzanne Brockmann write romantic suspense. No one who has read their books can think Rita Herron's is in the same category. You will like it if romantic intrigue is not what you are looking for."
4,Historical perspective of preaching,"This book has some age on it, true enough, and some of its concepts of preaching may be outmoded for 21st century congregations, but not all. I got it for the chapter on the history of preaching which I found to be most helpful."
3,A pleasant soundtrack album,"This album starts with a song of jaw-dropping beauty, ""Madagasikara"", which any band from any country would be happy to have written. It begins with a solemn synthesizer part and quickly moves into an accordian-based salegy dance beat with massed voices and group hand-claps. (Salegy is a 12/8 beat with the emphasis on the second note in each triplet).This music was originally the soundtrack to a documentary about Madagascar. While the first three songs are dance songs performed by the entire band, most of the rest is mood pieces. Soundtrack music. Of these, a highlight is ""Mitopa"", which sounds like the Malagasy equivalent of something Fairport Convention might do."
4,Video captures intended spirit,"I have scene over 30 playboy videos and this is one the better productions. Unlike the fun/frolicy/girly theme in many playboy video scenes this video features more erotic/seductive themes and the girls pull it off nicely. Lusch ladies in lusch environments succoming to the heat, well done procution , and one of the more explicit playboy videos."
5,Very important book,"If you have ever had a job, or ever will, this is a book you should read. The concepts explored in this book matter today as much as the day it was written to every working person. It's short, easy to get through, and I promise you'll never forget this story."
3,Upton Sinclairs so so book!,After reading other books by the author this book lagged a bit in the plot. Too much sub plots compared to what I wanted to read about the coal company and employees.
4,My kid loves Dora,We bought this DVD double feature for a road trip diversion for a long drive over Christmas. It was a hit!
4,"Although dated, it remains a good primer on the origin and evolution of the universe","Since this book was originally written in 1952, a lot of scientific discovery has taken place. Nevertheless, it remains a solid description of the history of the universe from the ""big bang"" until what we see today. That is generally due to the excellent expository writing of Gamow, he is able to take the complex nature of astrophysics and distill it down into an understandable form. He does all of this while retaining the fundamental science, which is sometimes very difficult. Gamow also never hesitates to use formulas when there is an obvious need for them. Therefore, even after 50 years this book is still a good primer on the origin and fundamental nature of the universe."
3,Dated.,Somewhat dated science and explanations of the universe but good explanations and analogies on the more simple established principles of cosmology.
2,Not a help to me.,"I had this book along with the Lonely Planet guide to Montreal. I found that the Lonely Planet guide to Montreal had better information on Quebec City than this book did.It may be that this book is just not designed for people like me, but I just did not find this book useful."
2,Mis- information,"We were disappointed in the inaccuracies in the information regarding Quebec City. The listing for the Auberge St. Antoine indicated two levels of parking (valet and self park); in fact the hotel only offers valet parking and for considerably less than listed in the book. The hours for at least one of the tourist attractions were not correct. The biking information does not include the nice trail in Levis accross the St. Lawrence and accessible by ferry (no car required); instead, the book sends you to an island that requires a car and does not have traffic free paths."
5,Excellent quality and a great price to boot,"I've tried a number of prepared versions of the Sole Almondine and find Omaha Steaks product to be the most succulent and delicious of them all. The preparation is easy, straightforward, and always has excellent results. This dish has impressed even my most critical foodie friends with its wonderful flavor, texture, and delicious golden brown crust."
3,it's more of basic introduction,It does a good job of explaining recent developments that affects operational risk area in post Basel-II accord situation. This book fits the knowledge requirement of a NEW entrant in 'operation risk management' area & is also useful to an insurance industry marketing specialist who is ever looking at new ways to expand insurance business on downstream side of the banking industry. A good number of chapters cover ways and methods to use insurance as a shield against operational losses.Chapter-8 on Six Sigma method to improve management control over banking operations is useful for operational risk control personnel in banking.
3,Humayun Ali,Author does in fairness mention make a great deal of arguments for the need for operational risk. The problem is that anyone buying the book already understands there is a need. They are buying the book to get hints on what to do about it. I know it is all relative but as an expert he needs to take a stand and come up with some fairly universal best practices.

5,Great for those who dont wanna spend ....,"I recently got this at Costco, and it's perfect for a room of my size. the frequency is awesmoe and the equalizer gives it more feeling. I can listen to it all day, and the 5 CD changer isnt too confusing or hard to figure out. Great if you're looking for a great stereo, not too much, but not totally tricked out."
5,"Homosexuality is a ""queer"" thing","Come to think of it, homosexuality is a strange phenomenon indeed. If sexual attraction between the opposite sexes evolved to encourage reproduction, same-sex attraction should have been a curious evolutionary error inevitably selected against. And yet gay people has always been around. Could it be Mother Nature found this situation advantageous to the species? If so, why? This book tries to answer this evolutionary puzzle.Intriguing read for both gay and straight people interested in evolutionary science."
4,A fun read,"The characters are engaging and the plot rarely slows. Wilde weaves comic book heroines and government agents and secrets together and makes it work. Of course her heroine and hero are the best part of the book. For Texans, the locale is as much a part of the story as the characters."
2,A little unrealistic,"I picked this up on a whim, mostly because of the cute front cover. However, I ended up disappointed because the character's behavior is so completely unbeleivable. I'm all for fun and whimsy, but there has to be a backbone of reality. None of these characters acted like people do in real life. After a couple of chapters, their antics became annoying to read. Also, I found the dialogue rather cheesy."
5,You only love twice,"Loved this book! Angelina Avenger as the voice in Marlie's head was terrific! Made me laugh, made me cry and in the end, she gets the guy! Great read!"
1,"Rehashed, repeated, rediculous","Come on, ... another book that tells you the same things as all the others? It's been done. It's over. Move on. Have a job that fits around your writing schedule, have a space dedicated to that pursuit, don't let others get you down and follow your dream no matter how little those around you understand or accept it, submit to every contest, develop and maintain contacts, read, write and read and write some more. There, I saved you the postage and cost and time you'd otherwise be spending reading something that tells you you should be writing."
4,amazing,if you started with Bayat .. you will buy the album.. one of the most amazing instrumentals ever.. and at parts.. you will feel your whole soul is moved by it..and will get you speechless and wanting to hear it again and again and again..
5,great!,Some really good music on this CD for those who prefer a little international music to the same old stuff you usually hear in the States.
2,Pretty but poorly thought through construction,"my daughter received both of these items for a gift. the horses will NOT stay connected to the carriage at all and she is 6 and gets very frustrated playing w/ it. the carriage moves fine on its own, just can't use any horses. same with the saddles coming off and going on. as far as the vanity, very tippy on carpet as i was putting it together. i wouldn't let a child snap the pieces of the long white rods-wouldn't trust not to break. not impressed. only had out of box for a day, will see how long both of them last. we however got them as seperate buys. not as joint deals!"
2,disappointing,"My 5 year old daughter was very excited to receive the horse and carriage from Santa. Excitement quickly turned to frustration. The horses come apart from the carriage after being moved a couple of inches, even if moved very slowly. The carriage now sits on her dresser with her favorite dolls. It's a pretty carriage, just don't expect to get any play time out of it."
3,Would be great if it stayed together,"We do not have the vanity/wedding table set, but my daughters recieved the carriage for Christmas. They really like using it, but get frustrated with it very easily because the horses will not stay attached to the carriage. It's not easy to push this toy on the floor, you have to lift both horses off the floor in order to move it smoothly. But the second you move the horses, they become unattached from the carriage. The carriage itself is great. It rolls smoothly, has plenty of room for 2 dolls in the seat and 1 driver. It would be a fun toy if only it would stay together."
2,Cheaply made toy very frustrating for children to play with.,My daughter who is 6 wanted this for her birthday. We got it home and put it together. She went to play with it and the horses fell off of the carriage. She tried putting them back on and couldn't. I put them back on and she went to play with it and they fell off again. She was very frustrated. Now she just plays with the horses and the Barbie dolls we purchased to go with it. She does not play with the carriage at all.Her 16 month old and 4 year old sister play with the carriage they put their little people and weeble wobbles in it and push it around. Not worth the price we paid at all. Very disapointed in Mattel. I should have talked her into getting the Barbie Learning Notebook which is what she originally said she wanted until she saw this in the store.I do not recommend this toy at all unless you want frustrated children or if you want to constantly put the horses back on all the time.
2,So pretty but Poorly Made,Another cheaply made Barbie product. It's so pretty but it falls apart the instant a child starts playing with it. My daughter has resorted to leaving it on her dresser most of the time. Very disappointing item.
1,terrible,"dont buy this toy if you don't want it to be thrown across the room!! This toy was a cheap piece of crap. The horses didn't stay on the carriage. My 4 year old gets frustrated. My husband bolted the horses with a nail so they would stay together. Not worth 1.00 neverless 10.00. I paid 30.00 and now I wonder ""why is it so cheap? DUH"
5,My 4 year old LOVED this toy!!,"My daughter caught onto the Princess and the Pauper craze a little late, so it was difficult to find the coordinating toys. She plays with the horse and carriage everyday, re-creating scenes from the movie. She does find it easier to work without the horses attached."
3,Sometimes difficult but worth the effort,"Though the style is semi-academic, the text is often dense, and the notes and citations are somewhat technical, there exits no better analysis of the regnal lists of Dalriada and the Picts, which by their union in the 9th century formed the nucleus of Scotland. A highly trustworthy interpretative source."
2,What?,"This book has received more praises than it really deserves. I can't belieive that over the years people have believed and mentioned that this book exposes colonial injustices in central Africa. What?Furthermore, the author, Joseph Conrad, takes pride in insulting African people by hiding behind a fictitious character. Will I be wrong to question whether Conrad thinks that Africans are savages? I just can't believe that Africans speak positively and highly of this book. It is an affront!"
4,feels good to pick up,this is my favorite set of shakers. they will go on a black-with-stainless-steel-chips silestone counter. i know it will be stunning.
4,Scuff-prone work sneaker,"I wear these to work and nobody seems to notice they are sneakers. They do get noticed, however.I have been told they are major high-style urban footwear. They have a nice diamond-plate texture, and are very glossy.I like them because they are warm, comfy and waterproof. OK, I like how they look. The only drawback is they can be scuffed easily and I haven't found a way to shine them back up."
1,This is not an RC truck,We ordered this because my son wanted an RC truck. The picture in the ad looks like a cool RC truck but what came in mail is a clear plastic cover for an RC truck. The picture in the ad is not what is being sold. Needless to say I am returning the plastic cover and seeking a refund.
4,Padme over Leah,"My 4-year-old daughter asked for ""Star Wars"" for Christmas. She already had Luke and Han but not Princess Leah. I was disappointed with the selection of Leah--either the doll was ugly (looked like a man) or not available. So I bought Padme. Excellent choice. My little girl loves her--and she isn't ugly. She actually looks like a woman."
5,A portrait,"This is a heartfelt journey through two worlds of music, a portrait for sure, and artfully done. It subtly underscores how there can be similarities between Scotch Irish song and traditional Indian song, and in that way is a sweet revelation. She weaves her ancestors voices, indeed."
3,Disappointing music,"With such an excellent voice, I expected tintillating music. Sorry to say I was disappointed. Well known songs including sanskrit prayers were rendered in unusually unemotional tone. Sheila can do much better than simply floating mediocre albums."
2,"Nice Voice, But Dull Songs","The first song on the CD I liked . . . Chandra has a wonderful voice, but the songs for the most part are just kind of dull. A little music in the background rather than only her voice would have made been nice. I wasn't much impressed."
4,Very relaxing,"Sheila Chandra is one of my favorites. Her voice is so smooth and rich. The execution of each note is right in tune. The bols she sings is very interesting, not a favorite of mine, but I do find it amazing that someone can sing like that. If you purchase this CD, I think you'll be pleased."
4,HOLLAND'S FINEST FUSION GUITARIST TO DATE,"Finally available is the first solo recording by European guitarist (he's lived in several countries, including Germany and Belgium) Joop Wolters. The recording shows his guitar and songwriting skills developing throughout the year he spent recording it. Capturing various styles and moods, the nine instrumental songs switch from funky rhythms to full-blown, pedal-to-the-metal rock, Workshop has it all. The opening track, ""Tibet"" is reminiscent of early Jason Becker and Marty Friedman Shrapnel-era metal tracks, while the remainder of the CD mines a more hard rock vein."
4,"The good, the bad, and the ugly of WWII films","While many of these films aren't particularly good, a few are definitely worth the price of admission. A Walk In the Sun is an all-time classic, while Gung Ho and Go For Broke are entertaining looks at lesser known WWII stories. Films like Aerial Gunner are also interesting as pieces of propaganda that were both entertaining and educational. As with all budget titles like this, the quality ranges from fair to bad, but it's hard to argue with the price. Definitely worth picking up if you like old war movies."
1,Compressed to an impressionist window pane,"What a krappy production. The original films are almost undetectible due to over compressing 5 movies PER SIDE with 20 movies on two double sided disks...NO NOT FOUR DISKS but two disks, double sided that they call four. To make things worse, mine came with scuff marks inside a sealed case.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,20 classic war movies,I got this set for my room mate and It is great. alot of not so popular films and alot of good acting and entertainment. We would watch them if there is nothing on tv or a rainy day or lazy day. Id recommend this to any war movie buff. pop some corn and kick back for the hell that war was during this era.
2,I am quite disappointed.,"It did not contain all the listed movies. Some were of very poor quality. They were certainly not ""classic"" movies. I was quite disappointed."
2,Error In Movie List,"The copy I got did not have ""The Battle of El Alamein"" on it. Instead it had ""A Walk in the Sun"". That was not what I was expecting."
3,MIxed revue,"Some of the movies included in this collection are good, others are very mediocre. All in all a good value."
3,great for the price,"The price was so low I couldnt pass it up. I adore WWII movies from the 40's. I would have paid the price just for ""Go For Broke"". I used to live in a japanese-american area of Los Angeles called Gardena, and my landlord was in this unit. Also enjoyed ""Gung Ho"" and the other vintage ones. Havent been able to sit thru the other ones, but vintage movies were great."
2,Stroller okay... Carseat HORRIBLE!!!!,"We purchased this travel system in another pattern in October 05. I don't mind the stroller, our 6 month old seems very comfortable in it. However, we have had endless problems with the infant seat!!! First of all, you can only use the carseat with the base (there are no slots to slide a seatbelt through on the carseat itself) We have two vehicles and it has been a real pain transfering and readjusting the base everytime! Second, our baby is only 6 months old and 15 pounds and for the last two months has felt too heavy for the seat. We are already seeing white distress marks on the handle! I loved the pattern of the set, and that is unfortunately the only thing I was looking for at the time so, please DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!"
4,Works Great for Me,"I have this travel system just in a different pattern. I have never had any problems with it. I thought the car seat was awesome and it was lighter than most of the other car seats (especially the pricier ones). I loved the stay in car base, it has made my life easier. I had a very big baby (born at 8 lbs 22 1/2 in. and growing like a weed!) and I have never seen any stress marks. These carriers are not made to keep a baby in them for to terribly long. Safety reports say you should switch to a convertible (or bigger carrier) seat when your child is 26 inches or their head is one inch below the top.The stroller has never given me any problems either and I use it ALL THE TIME. I find it easy to collapse and very easy to set it up (2 hands are required to set it up). I would recommend this system to others."
2,My Son cries everytime,I picked this stroller because I thought it would be great to get everything in one but that was a mistake. My 3 month old hates the car seat. I have this set in a different color. Since it does not recline he can't sleep well in it and he gets air when drinking his bottle because the seat sits up to high. We took a 10 hour road trip and he was very uncomfortable. This seat may be good for the older baby who is able to shift position on their own but not for the little ones. The stroller is nice but it takes up too much space and it is heavy.
1,A waste of time.,"If the author was trying for a Damon Runyon type story, it didn't work. I found the slang, the situation and the general premise of the story to be unbelievable.I enjoy period mysteries but couldn't reconcile the inconsistencies that made it difficult to know in which decade the author had placed the story."
2,"Cute pics, not much language","My son likes looking at the cute pictures but there is no story, not many words and so it's use as a teaching aid or story book is limited. And you can do better learning single words with the Usborne ""First 1000 words in French""... it also has cute pics to look at but it also has a lot more words..."
4,A very detailed natural guidebook of Kittitas County,"Unfortunately, this book is out of print and hard to find. It IS available on the net, however. There is much good information for students as wellas recreationalists. I wish I could find a copy."
3,Good video,"Overall, this is a pretty good video. Doesn't quite compare other Playboy vids. The women are all attractive but most are not quite playmate material. All the women featured submitted home made videos to Playboy in hopes of making the cut. The format of the video is to start out with a brief intro of the girl, then home video followed by a playboy produced video. My favorite segment is the one of Roxanne."
3,Not as pretty and delicate as it looks in the picture,"Looking at the online picture, it looks like a fine peace of art. In reality it is just a picture printed on a piece of plastic. The quality is not that excellent and the picture sheet gets off the bottom after some use. It might be worth for the price, but I don't call it a bargain."
1,Cheap,One week after I purchased this product it started to come apart. It is definitely NOT worth the money. I did not abuse it. I used it as anyone would normally use a mouse pad.
3,no good for MS wireless mouses,"These mouse pads are beautiful but according to Microsoft's troubleshooting page for wireless mouses, anything with reds/browns in it will interfere with tracking.This is true for my Laser 5000 mouse. The mouse keeps thinking it has a low battery. When I go to check the battery level, it is good. Unfortunately, the message pops up over and over, sometimes half a dozen are opened up on top of each other. There is no fix for this, so my beautiful mousepad had to be replaced."
2,BIBLE Prophecy Chart - PAMPHLET,"PAMPHLET--Good, sound, Biblically based Chart--but over-priced. LaHaye is a very good author, but this should have been part of a more comprehensive book on prophecy. It actually is just a fold-out sheet on heavy weight stock and laminated (I think.) I was disappointed.Grant Hoatson"
4,not a classic but...,"""still bout it"" is not as dark, ruff, and violent as the first one but it's always cool to this all the no limit staff in a film, which there are good acting, action, music. The story isn't very extraordinary but it's fresh."
1,Waste of Time...,"I like Master P and all, but, dude can't act! Silk The Shocker can't act! The only reason i gave it 1 star, is because the story was iight, and saying iight, is a stretch, but it was ok for a Master P movie. At times, it seemed they made this movie with a camcorder, i mean the acting was just horrible, i recommend you borrow this movie from someone who already has it, its not worth a dime, and i wouldnt pay a penny for it."
3,Pleased,"I was very satisfied with the quickness in which I received this movie, the price was reasonable as well. Thank you so much."
1,Broke after one week,"This cat door worked great- for a week. Then my cats busted through the ""locked"" door and broke the lock. Poorly made product. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your entire door after a week of use!"
3,It works,"It works, The door hits the edge and slightly sticks open. I wouldn't considered it whether resistant. It works for my needs."
4,Not for every application,"I needed a solution to allow the cat into the utility room without having to open the door. I give this product four stars because for this interior application it does it's job. The locking mechanism is not very sturdy, for me it doesn't matter as I won't be locking it, but if you plan to use the lock you may look elsewhere.**PROS**-Discrete looking-Inexpensive-Easy to install:-Includes traceable template-Requires drill and jig-saw-My model included the plastic tunnel between each side which is good for hollow interior doors**CONS**-Locking tab is flimsy and probably won't last if used frequently-Build quality as a whole is what you would expect given the priceOverall I would recommend this product to a friend if they were in a similar situation to myself. If they needed a door that could lock in various situations, I would recommend to keep looking."
1,Cats broke flap!!!,"A year ago I bought the cat door, and it was a godsend. I needed to keep the cats in the laundry room during the night and when I am out of the house. They get into everything. At first they still managed to get through the door, after playing the blame game for a while ""oh you didn't lock the door again honey"", we decided to set up a webcam and watch it one night and realized that the cats were using their heads and paws to bash it open. So we decided to put the flap behind the double prong lock part. It worked. Until the other day, the cats have managed to bash through the flap, while locked behind the double lock device, and break it. There is a crack right where the lock is supposed to hold it in place, so it no longer serves it's purpose. I'm absolutely furious because I have a baby now and they got into my fresh fruits/vegetables (her homemade foods). I would never recommend this. Get a door with a pull out door thing such as for indoor/outdoor ones."
2,cat door,"Yes, it is easy to install. The closure mechanism is a little difficult to switch back and forth. My main problem is that my medium sized dog has gotten in through it and broke the hard plastic flap... I have gone through two of them so far. Now, I looking for a door with a flexible flap, because I don't believe there are replacement parts for this one."
1,Kitty Door Review,"The door having the ability to lock in four different ways is a great idea, however, the mechanism is very difficult to switch from one locking position to another once the door is installled. In some cases, the mechanism will not shift at all, better off just getting the flap door at a cheaper price."
1,mechanism doesn't work,"The mechanism doesn't work. If you set it to open, it can get jostled (by, say, a cat) into a locked position. Whoops-- you just locked out your cat."
2,Poorly Designed,"I installed this in my dining room to basement door to give access to a litter box in the basement.My cats like to paw at the switch. They are actually able to lock the door themselves. My cat locked himself out of the basement and ended up peeing all over my bed because he couldn't get to the litter box.As a partial solution, I will be moving the switch to the basement side of the door. I think the switch shouldn't be so bulky though."
2,Hard to set to correct position,"This cat door is very tricky to get to the right position (in only, etc.) and recently the sliding knob just broke off. So now I'm in the market for a new door."
2,Only fits one size of door,"As others have stated, this is a cheaply made cat door, don't buy it. Besides the terribly designed locking mechanism, the door you install this in must be exactly a certain thickness, otherwise the front and back halves will not mount properly. In addition, the back half does not even screw into the door or the other half, instead, it is held on by taping it to the door! If you're trusting like me, you'll realize all this after you cut the hole in the door."
2,Poorly Made,"This door was a great idea, but it is very poorly made. If I lock the door, for instance to keep our cats upstairs when we have company, the cats will just paw at the door until finally they somehow worked the screws out and knocked the face off of the door. It does not work for hollow-core doors AT ALL! I don't know if any other brands would work for hollow-core doors, but this one certainly does not."
1,You get what you pay for,"Lock mechanism broke after one day. Made a jimcrack replacement, but as others here attest, the switch is a problem. Door popped out of alignment, came out of frame. A total waste of money. Much happier with the ""Ideal Pet"" brand version of this item."
4,Beyond New Age,"Any culture that can embrace the concept of a taco pizza should have no problem accepting the concept of an Irish/Japanese/Chinese musical trio, and anyone who takes a chance and gives this CD a listen should have no trouble taking Trisan to heart. Featuring flutes, percussion, keyboards, and voice, the trio of Pol Brennan (ex-Clannad), Joji Hirota, and Guo Yue have put together a CD that goes far beyond New Age in both style and substance. My wife was fortunate enough to hear Trisan live when WOMAD came to Columbus: she prefers the CD--because the sound is so much better! (So much for the concept of ""the absolute sound."")"
1,dont waste your money,"Horrible cd-I love Clannad and almost everything they've ever done-but this cd sucks big time. Just a lot of irritating noise. Pol-what were you thinking? You've taken ""artsy"" to a new low."
1,Don't buy this DVD player,I had this player for 2 months and it is already giving me problems. The picture quality is terrible. Green lines appear across the screen when a movie is playing. The player was great for the first 2 months. Good luck if you decide to take a chance with this player.
3,Gritty,"No real heroes here, but some tough characters, whose amorality overwhelms the reader. A fascinating start for a new author. The next one should be interesting."
1,Very Disappointing,As an Irish-American who grew up in the Bronx I thought I might enjoy this novel. Was I wrong.Ledwidge's characterizations of IRA members looked like something from British [DIS]Information Service. The rest of his characters rang untrue also and the plot was improbable.
4,Auspicious debut..OK so I'm late to the party,"I love discovering new authors...well, new to me anyway. The Narrowback is a great debut and a must read for noir fans. Those reviewers who critisized this work for having unsympathetic characters have little or no understanding of noir fiction. The writing will hook you from page one, even though there are descriptive passages that could have been trimmed a bit, this is easily overlooked as the impact of the work is mezmerizing."
1,Teisseire Framboise Raspberry Syrup,"I was very disappointed with this product. It is mostly sugar syrup with some raspberry flavoring (15%). The raspberry taste is very weak, being overwhelmed by the lemon and other berry flavor. Another brand that I ended up purchasing as a replacement was far better, but I admit it cost a lot more. I wish the ingredients had been viewable before receiving it (at least I couldn't find a link to see what the ingredients were). Perhaps the bottle that I got was too old, though the date on it says 02/2011."
3,"Slightly sweet, but overall good flavor","I really enjoy drinking flavored soda and tonic water. It doesn't take much of this raspberry syrup to make a nice refreshing drink. A little less sugar and a little more raspberry would be nice, but this product is good for the price."
4,Good economy system,"I've had this for about a week now. I have played several CD's and listened to the radio for a good period of time.1) Sound quality is good untill you turn it up more than about 2/3'sof the way and then it distorts. However at 2/3's the volume levelis enough for me.2) CD changer is noisy.3) Hook up is easy.4) It takes a little while to master the operation of this unit but after reading the manual and playing around a bit it's not complicated.In conclusion this unit will not replace my Onkyo/Polk system but whwen you consider that I spent >$3000 on that system and $250 on this one why would it. Good sound untill cranked too high, one of the few systems with a seperate powered sub, and nice features I would recommend this system to anyone looking in this price range."
1,AK610 - Stay away from this garbage!,"This player is a piece of junk. It skips while playing CDs, and has been doing so since day 1. Customer service is terrible as well. I have a $225 piece of junk. Don't buy it."
4,The book helps start to the user interface design.,"This is a good Delphi book. It doesn't repeat the Delphi documentation. It really adds code that is worth having and talks about issues related to user interface design. However the book needs to address more issues of the user interface design, so this is not a complete book on interface design. But the author did a good job to start the Delphi beginner programmer like me. I really recommend this book if you are a beginner or intermidate Delphi programmer."
4,Excellent information not found elsewhere,"Lots of good information, examples and GUI theory and all oriented around Delphi 3. Very effective explanations of and reasons for various ways of presenting data and user controls."
4,Good Book,"This memoir tells the story of roughly twenty-five years of life lessons learned with and from the members of his wheelchair basketball team through Coach Shaver's viewpoint. The book provides a good starting point for someone without exposure to disability in their life. It has humor, and is relatable. I would recommend this book to others to read. I would however point out that it could use a revision by an editor, as there are many grammatical and typographical errors throughout the book"
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"After using this product for several weeks, I can sum up my experience in two words ""doesn't work.""I followed the directions on the jar religiously ever since I received this product and have seen absolutely NO CHANGE in the condition that was diagnosed as eczema by my doctor several years ago.I was hoping I could find a non-steroidal treatment for eczema. The claims on the company website made me think that someone finally came up with one. Not so.It's back to the doctor for some expensive, dangerous steroids that will actually enable me to manage this condition."
2,Light Reading,"The book is a good general read for people interested into getting into Motorcycle, but it is not everything you need to know about owning, enjoying and maintaining a bike."
4,Symphony is missing!,"I really enjoyed the soundtrack, but there is a symphony that is played throughout the movie. I was hoping it would be on the soundtrack but it isn't. Would anybody happen to know the name of it? Thank you!"
3,good movie,"Some people may not like this movie and think that it is boring, I must agree that certain parts of this movie are boring. The plot of the story is good and very well written. If you like long movies about old times, you should definately go see this movie."
1,disappointing CD,The Aviator CD plays music that I do not even recognize from the movie. The movie had good old music from the period the movie represented Veryyyy disapointed.
5,For the Record,"IT should be pointed out as i'm sure it is on the movie credits and CD, that George Gershwin Wrote ""...Stairway to Paradise"".The 20's band vesion by the Paul Whiteman orchestra,would also be of intrest to those who like rufus Wainwright's."
4,Good Music,If you like music from the 30's you'll like this. Great sound quality too. Would rate this high as I am a buff of 20's and 30's music.
5,The Volkswagen Super Beetle Handbook,The Volkswagen Super Beetle Handbook HP1483: A Restoration Guide For 1971-1974 Models is really informative.
1,Book Doesn't Match Title or Subtitle,"I just bought a '71 Super Beetle and purchased three books here for help in getting the best use from it. This book was a big disappointment in that I found both its title and subtitle to be a poor reflection of the actual contents.This book is a reprint of series of articles in VWTrends Magazine in which a '71 Super Beetle was restored. It is mostly pictures and general text. There are a few useful specifics, but not many. In almost every step of the restoration, the car was turned over to professionals. So there is very little that will help an amateur in restoring their own Bug."
2,not helpful,"I found this book to be of little use in the restoration of my Super Beetle. It is by and large a picture book. There are no technical diagrams or descriptions, just pictures with brief descriptions. Pass on this and buy the Bentley manual."
5,WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ALL OF YOU!!!?????,"I did not have high expectations for this movie because of all of you, but it was great! See it before you judge it. Not planning to buy it , though. SEE IT!!!!"
1,Horrible,This is a rip off and Islam propaganda. Since when do we have cartoon characters praying to Allah? I guarantee you would not find one praying to God or to Jesus unless it was a Christian cartoon. I was watching this with my grandchildren and was very offended.The movie ended up in the trash where it belongs.
2,Scooby Doo where are you (and Shaggy)?!,"My kids love the Scooby Doo DVDs. We bought this one hoping to add more Scooby to choose from. The kids actually walked away from the TV. It was almost unrecognizable as a Scooby Doo cartoon. It was more like ""Hannah-Barbara rips off Scooby Doo"". Don't waste your money because you will just be disappointed with the whole thing."
1,Returned same weekend in 1994: Not worth watching,"This is the only video I ever rallied at a Suncoast employee to take back. My Mom and I bought all new releases of Disney from there and they were nice enough to do a return for credit on the VHS of this thing back in 1994 when it came out.We were THAT adamant about it being pure trash and were THAT disappointed. For good customers, they took it back."
2,Too much buffering,Too much buffering through out the movie. At points it froze my Roku player and I had to restart the player.
1,scooby doo Arabian Nights.,"This is a ripoff tape for scooby fans, no more than 10 mins of scooby and shaggy."
2,not scooby doo,We rented this dvd and I was very disappointed. A major portion of the show doesn't even have scooby or shaggy in it. Glad we rented this one instead of buying it.
1,PAAAAATHETIC!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!,"This was by far a complete, and utterly insult to all Scooby doo movies. It only had them in it a short time, Shaggy sounded terrible and it was just awful. I would have given it a minus twenty stars for this. My son also found it extremly boring and he is only 3!!!!!!!!! GO FIGURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,OK But Not the Best Scooby Doo Movie,This Scooby Doo.I think is the worst Scooby Doo movie.The story is about Scooby Doo and Shaggy travel to Arabia to become the kings royal food tasters and when they eat everthing they are chased by the king and his guards.Shaggy dresses up as a girl to fool the king and guards and the king wants to marry Shaggy so Shaggy tells storys to make the king sleepy and so they can escape.The storys Shaggy tells is a Aladdin type story and others.The story plot is not that good.Don't buy the video its not that great.
5,A great Hanna-Barbera experience!,"I wanted to see this for myself. Some people I knew saw it they said it stunk, but what do I know? i saw it, It was GREAT! This DVD is full of cool extra's. And the movie was totally awesome. I geuss this could bend either way some people may not like this because it only has 20 minutes tops of Scooby Doo but don't stop the movie. I repeat don't stop the movie. You'll find Arabian Nights enjoyable with old Hanna-Barbera favorites like Yogi Bear and Boo Boo and Magilla Gorilla as Alladin's fortunes and Sinbad. This movie can be a totally interesting way to learn about Arabian Nights. I give it an A + ! I don't care what the other people say, listen to me this movie is awesome, great, and cool at the same time!!!!!!!!!!"
4,When in jolly old England,"This book is a bit dry, but it provides a lot of information (and flavor) for those deceased famous people that the brits revere. Once I started reading it, I went with the flow and realized that several hours had passed. Even if you don't plan to travel to any of the places listed in the book, it provides you with some interesting facts and historical information."
2,Dont bye if you have a Slim PSP,It said on the box(which was from walmart) that this cable was meant for the psp slim model.I dont know if it has something to do with the usb charge(which I followed all procedures by Sony) but it doesnt sync with my computer. It charges if you plug the power part into it but it doesnt sync. I tried another chord that was laying around and it still didnt sync. I thought it was my computer so I brought my friends psp over to test it. It worked fine with my spare chord which meens the 2-In-1 USB Power Cable will impair your PSP Slim's syncing cabibilities. Just bye a wall charger. Ill give it two stars for the fact that it charges.
3,War and Civilization,"War and Civilization by Arnold J. Toynbee (c.1950) It is a rare book to fine filled such bombast, which has a important lesson to learn, albeit an oversimplified one. (Hey, it is hard to put 5,000 years of human history in 165 pages.) The basic nub of it was many nations do not fall because of decadence, decay, and decline, rather it is their military successes that sound their death knells, through growing resentments from friends and enemies, and through hubris which causes them to overextend themselves in a series of protracted wars."
4,second purchae,This is the second time I have purchased the 7 speed impulse bullet....My first lasted a year and a half.....then the wiring went bad.....well worth the money!!!!
1,This DID NOT WORK!,"I opend the box and inserted brand new batteries. It DID NOT WORK! (No power or even a light). I have tried different batteries from other devices that I know work and it still did not power on... AND NO, not USER ERROR! I will be sending this back for a refund.I'm only giving this a 1 star rating as this opinion survey does not allow you to not post your review without selecting a star rating. I would not even give this a 1 star if I had the option.What a shame!"
4,"Pretty decent, but....","I bought my previous ""buddy"" at a pleasure party. It lasted 4 years, but recently the wires came loose and I had to buy a replacement. I looked online and found this. The website stated this was a very powerful vibrator. I was actually a little let down. It has many settings, which is nice, but none of them are as strong as the one I had before. It does the trick, but I wish it was stronger. Also, the cord on this one is shorter. I could really use another 4 inches. All in all, it is a great toy, but it's not perfect."
2,"Good Vibes, but not durable","While this toy was working, it was GREAT! However, it didn't last very long - started having to be held in a certain position. Then stopped working. I spliced the wires and it worked a while longer, but I got less than 6 months out of this."
1,how to be ashamed of your masculinity,"Stoltenberg is the classic 'soft male' Bly speaks of so wisely. This book panders to women's fears and disempowers everyone by fostering shame for men's natural passions and joys. For millennia traditional arrangements between men and women were essential for survival - now, thanks to men's inventiveness, they're not. It is sad that Stoltenberg's construction of masculinity is so myopic that he sees only evil.The other reviews that talk about the feminist straw woman of radical teachings should sit in on a few university classes where students are shamed just for having a penis. The hostility of academic feminism, idealized by Stoltenberg, is very real and helps neither women nor men."
5,Gees Bend Notecards,These cards are beautiful and they came in a timely manner.I am truly enjoying them!
1,Bench for nook set,"The bench looks nice but is made poorly. When putting it together the screw heads snapped and we can not get the replacement screws anywhere. We again called the customer service number enclosed and no one calls back. The bench is also weak, it bend when my two young sons sit on it."
1,Unfortunately this is the only book available on this topic,"This brochure offered very little new information to me, if any at all. If you go through the loan process on your own with a realtor and loan officer or learn about it through another book you already know 95% of what this booklet has to offer. The other 5% can be picked up by talking with a few realtors or loan officers. I was hoping to learn different strategies to do what the title says, but apparently there is only one way to go through the rent-to-own process. At [price] per page, this pamphlet is way over-priced for the content you purchase."
2,What ??!,"I've loved this movie since i was a kid, and I want to get this for my son for his birthday coming up. (he's going to be 3) My question is why in the hell is it 60 stinking dollars ???! I wish I could go see it in Imax and it still would be cheaper!! What's the deal?"
1,Disappointed,"This pizza stone is one big disappointment. I previously had a Sassafras Pizza Stone(for nearly 20 years until it finally cracked)which was fantastic. It cooked the pizza perfectly and browned the crust evenly. This new pizza stone (purchased a few months ago and which is not made of the same material)leaves the crust soggy. Obviously, whatever materials it is made from does NOT conduct the heat properly or in the same way as the old pizza stone. I say this with the experience of making several pizzas on it. The only way I can get a browned crust is to remove slices from the stone after baking, and put them in a heated frying pan for 3-4 minutes.Save yourself the money on wasted ingredients and a terrible dinner. It doesn't even deserve a one-star rating."
1,Stone broke while in oven,Large piece of the stone broke off while in the oven during it's second use!
5,Good Value,"I have used the baking stone approximately six times, and have been very pleased.I know others have written about bad experiences, but I think if one reads the instructions which come with the product, there is less chance of a bad experience.I would not hesitate to recommend this product."
4,product review,"It is a gimmick that doesn't work very well. I used too much corn meal and it caused a lot of smoke in the oven. Maybe, if I use just a little mineral oil and corn meal, it will work out. I had more problems with the pizza peel than I had with the pizza stone."
1,Broken,Came as ordered in working condition. So I stuck it in the oven and tried to make a pizza on it. As soon as the pizza dough hit the stone it cracked into 3 pieces. Save your money and go to Home Depot and pick up some unglazed tiles. Don't bother with this.
1,Cracked in half the first time I tried to use it.,"I received this baking stone as a gift that I had requested after reviewing many of the baking stones. It seemed the most useful for the cost. I followed the directions, put oil and cornmeal on it and heated it in my oven. Almost immediately the oven began smoking. We opened the oven and had to open all of the windows in the house due to the smoke. We took it out and placed it on a metal pan and within 2 minutes, it broke in half. Needless to say, it was a terrible investment."
3,12 x 12 Disco,"This Is A Great CD To Own If You Are Looking For Some Hard To Find Classic Disco Tracks Like ""Dario, Can You Get Me Into Studio...54"" & ""Think It Over"". It's Nice To Know That They Did Release Some Great Classics Finally On CD. It's A Winner!"
3,cut off last 4-5 stories !!!,"I bought this ...and others...as I was having major surgery and wanted some bedside reading. The first 46 stories, except for the Harlan Ellson one!...were an interesting compendium. The final 6...constant gore, sex and more sex...and mystery? NONE! If the book had not included these...all from 1990's I believe, a real treasury. The way it is..90% good; 10% trash; probably a 4 star..not a 3."
5,Great review of the century in mystery,"You'll read Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald, Willa Cather, Dashiell Hammett, and many more. Enjoyable overview of mystery writing in the last century."
1,Great play; Wrong edition,"This is a wonderful play, but the Grove edition sucks, just reproducing the original text. But the Samuel French edition (http://www.amazon.com/Rosencrantz-Guildenstern-Favorite-Broadway-dramas/) includes the original PLUS an author intro and additions to the text from staged productions. It's cheaper too (not that a few dollars is the issue)."
5,terrific,"a little more diversity of scenery than arcadia, but every bit as witty, introspective, funny, and engrossing as we've come to expect from the master playwright!read it!"
4,Sean's Thoughts,"From behind the scenes of Shakespeare comes a look at what two characters(who can't even tell themselves apart) do in their off stage. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two unimportant characters that Stoppard has taken from the pages of Hamlet and put into this interesting play. Therefore, if you have not yet read Hamlet, goodluck in following this play. Overall, Stoppard does a great job in incorperating pieces from the text of Hamlet and adding a lot of postmodernism to produce a witty and fun play. I would recomend it to all you Hamlet lovers."
4,Very Witty and Entertaining!,"I found Tom Stoppards'play to be a magnificent combination of wit, humor, and creativity. Stoppard takes you backstage to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are waiting to play their parts in the Hamlet production that is going on onstage. Their utter confusion about making decisions and frequent mentions of death make fun of thier basically inconsequntial parts in Shakespeares' Hamlet. Its length was very short, but there were always plenty of interesting allusions and thought-provoking lines. Overall, Stoppards' play was a witty twist on the orginal Hamlet and I would love to see the play in action."
1,Awful Presentation,"The book looked lousy on my Kindle Fire, was difficult to read, and I wondered why. So I got the same book for my iPad, and it was lovely, easy to read.The Kindle Fire needs better typography for this title."
4,Witty yet repetitive,"R & G is a book that challenges one view of the average novel. What a creative idea to rewrite an extremely well known play through the eyes of such minute characters. The idea is wonderful; the plot is insightful, especially if you've read Hamlet. While the humor is Leslie Neilson style ridiculous, some of it is quite redundant. If you are easily annoyed, maybe you should pass this one up! If you are a garganteous literary buff, however, this is a must read!"
3,I'm not as charmed as others.,"Disclaimer: I read this for English class.I did not think this book was good. The movie is somewhat better. However, the essential problem is that, given the lack of plot or drama, everything good about the play is comedy or profundity. Rather than making a truly funny play, which Stoppard could have done (the first players' scene is quite funny), he instead chose to alternate between mildly funny episodes and existentialist ponderings. The ponderings are not profound but rather stupid. Stoppard does not want to have his characters preach at the audience, so he has them make logical errors. However, this results in a lack of profundity, as the ""essential problems"" that they run into are easily identified as stupidity.Yeah, I just didn't like this book."
1,"A very boring play, BUT...","I gave Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead only one star, because that's how I felt about this play when I first saw it performed. At the time, I was just a kid who was unfamiliar with the story of Hamlet. To me it was boring, made no sense, and was not the least bit funny.HOWEVER... If you love Hamlet and know the story well, you will love this play. Before making any hasty judgements on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I strongly urge you to either read or watch Hamlet. Only then can you appreciate this play for what it is."
5,Foul! No repetition!,"I loved it, I really did. And I've never even read Hamlet. Rosencrantz is the dumb one and Guildenstern is the smart one. Which means, basically, that Guil makes long speeches while Ros flips (spins?) coins. It's hilarious by turns, especially the scene where they make fun of Hamlet's line, ""When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw."" They spend quite a while trying to decide whether the wind is southerly or not, after that. It's full of quotable lines, like . . . for example, my ""one-line summary of this review"". Really, as long as you know the plot of Hamlet, it's quite amusing, but I would guess that having read the actual play would add a depth to R & G are Dead that I'm totally missing."
1,DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION!!!,"I bought the Kindle edition of the play and received commentary rather than the actual play. I don't know if Amazon is aware of this mistake, but until they are, DO NOT BUY THIS."
4,Wonderful,"This is a great play to read even if one has never seen it performed live. There are wonderfully alive scenes and great dialogue. Actually, reading this is almost more enjoyable in some ways because little plot points are not lost on a reader."
5,The most hillarious angle on Shakespeare...upside-down!,"Take a great Shakespeare tragedy, add Tom Stoppard, throw everything on it's head, and you have Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead. Built into the world of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Stoppard's story of two misplaced, misnamed travelers is full of Jack Handy like deep thoughts, riveting laughs, and classic quotable lines. I love this book!!"
4,A grand aimlessness,"I first saw this as a film. It was so good that I bought the VHS version.The characters' existential wonderings are a bit of a smack in the face. And yet, there is a certain laughing at the darkness. Call it whisteling past the graveyard.We all know the end, but we argue against it until is it upon us. And even then. And that is what it is. In the end, aren't we all supporting characters in someone else's play?And we all call for some direction...."
5,"Diesel Technology: Fundamentals, Service by Andrew Norman","I bought the book to enhance my knowledge of diesel engines. I own two Cummins diesels and have many customers that own diesels. The book is well written, easily read, easy to understand, and well organized. Its a text book so a little previous knowledge with diesels is helpful. The information is presented in theory as most text books are and has a work book that goes along with it to enhance your learning experience if you wish to buy it separate. The end of the chapters also have review questions if your interested in serious learning. I would recommend this book to anyone studying diesel engines. Remember its a text book not a tech manual. The book was in great shape & I received it promptly when ordered from the seller. I would buy from them again."
1,Misleading or cheating?,"I was looking for the textbook. The Amazon site lists ""hardcover"" and ""paperback"" versions. The paperback version is significantly less expensive. So I ordered the paperback version. It turned out that this ""paperback"" version is actually not the textbook itself, but the workbook for the textbook. Yet on the Amazon website, it is simply listed as ""paperback"" together with ""hardcover"" version. This is misleading at best and cheating in reality. The Amazon site should specifically indicate that this is the workbook, not the textbook."
5,Good reference manual,This was bought as a gift. The recipient says it is a very useful and informative book. It has been used repeatedly and is still in great shape.
4,high quality textbook,I haven't figured out where the answers are to the questions that are listed after every chapter. I believe you have to purchase the workbook.not sure. I just go back and review through the reading for now.
4,Great book for understanding I-banking,This is a good book for anyone interested in seriously understanding the business of I-banking with its history and future implications. The portrayals of the different firms and the system as a whole are very informative. A Great text.
3,A good basic read -similar to other books though,"This is a good book put out by a consistently good publisher (Interweave Press) but I found it too similar to other ""basic"" or ""simple"" knitting type of books. The pillows, blankets and miscellaneous items (knit bottle cover) don't have enough of a difference or ""twist"" to really stand out from other similar books. Good if you are looking for a basic knit book."
4,Super Cute Stuff For Your Home,"I compulsively shop for knitting books and I bought this one because I found it on sale at Half-Price books for only $7.98, but after I took it home and got a really good look at it I realized what a bargain it reallly was.The book goes over all the basics (knitting tools, accessories, yarns, cast on, cast off, tension, etc) and then it starts slowly building your knitting skills with each project (from a basic garter stitch woven pillow to a three dimensional checkered cube/ottoman, to intarsia, to bobbles, to beading, etc).Really an excellent book that takes you seamlessly from a basic knitter to an advanced intermediate one easily. And at the end, you have lots of beautiful stuff for your home.I gave it only four stars by mistake I meant to give it five ***** and even tough I tried to correct that mistake I couldn't figure out how. =0p"
5,Love it,"I love this book. Most knitting books are all about things to wear (sweaters, vests, hats), and I don't wear hand knitted clothing beside scarfs. I wanted to knit pretty things that were actually useful. This book has patterns for beautiful throw pillows - I've already made 2 and am almost done with a third. Today I am going to start work on the baby blanket pattern - it is cute but not cutesy. The patterns in this book are classy and tasteful."
4,Very good for beginners,This is a very good book for beginners. Those who don't have anyone to teach them can find this book useful. I think this book could of had more designs to expand their learning. It was a bit simple.
2,Disappointed,"Enough with the Navy Seals already! I'm an avid Christina fan and have read all her books. However, this one was more Navy Ops than anything. I was disappointed that there wasn't more story based on the development of the relationship between the h/h. I will read Skye again, however, not a Seal one."
3,FAR FETCHED AND FUN!,"We have a book pool at the office and I took this home for a lark. What a fun book. Nothing too heavy. It was corny and wouldnt we all love to have a guy as ""enhanced"" as Max. Miki was cute and perky but it was Truman the wonder Lab that stole my heart. I love Labs.It was a very imaginative storyline. Wonder if our government is truly working on all the military enhancements. Now, I am in a quandry about Cruz. He's hateful right now but how did he get that way? and I think Ms. Skye left a doubt open for her next installment. I think, for now, I will look thru our office treasures for the 'Baby' installment. Sensuality is an 8."
4,MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I heard there is a release date for this film for Sept. 30, 2011, but I had a chance to see it at a screening already. I will admit I went with much trepidation, but by the time the film was done, I had a good time for two hours. This is definitely a genre film, in the vein of ANIMAL HOUSE, RISKY BUSINESS, and AMERICAN PIE, and even some NIGHT SHIFT, thrown in. But every film falls into some kind of story structure, and POOL BOYS is no different.This film is good-natured and is meant to be a feel-good film. Matthew Lillard and Rachelle Lefevre are quite good, actually making you care about their characters, and John Billingsley is a hoot as the Dean everyone wished they had. The party that wraps things up, is hilarious and worth the price of admission.This film is what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything more, and it succeeds admirably. The film is never mean or hateful to its own characters. Enjoyable."
4,Laughs that make a splash,"Hilarious movie! One word: statue. And I have never held the Olive Garden to the high esteem I now do - omg, too funny! Matthew Lillard and Rachelle Lefevre were great in this and I really love all the old favs like George Takei and Tom Arnold that make some of the scenes in the film so memorable. Efren Ramirez - the dancing is priceless. For the guys, plenty of hot chicks scantily clad - Patricia de Leon and Sheena Lee and a ton more. All-in-all a fun way to vegge out and let off some steam for an hour and a half. Definitely will see again and again!"
4,The Illustrations Make the Book,"The illustrations in this book are beautiful. I strongly believe in introducing children to the animals and habitat of the rain forest. This book is very basic, as the only text is the name of each animal on the left page with a picture of the animal on the right. It lists eight animals and shows a large picture of the rain forest in the opening and ending pages.I recommend this book for children up to three years old. Older children will probably want more of a story."
4,great reference book for ALL ages,"I was looking for a book that helped me teach ethics and values to my children and this is it! The book is formatted with a chapter for each ""value"" (honesty, etc) and then broken down by age, with discussions and ideas that are age-appropriate--from preschool thru high school.I am a fairly liberal parent. My husband and I have different religions. I found that this book was not heavy-handed or overly religious. It really seemed to stick with the actions and thoughts around each ethic. And studies have shown that ethical education is effective for children!"
2,UNREALISTIC,"Maybe in the perfect world children act as this book illustrates. If parents made children have such family discussions and play such games as the authors describe, the children would crack up laughing (especially school age children and adolescents). The book has about 7 games and discussions methods that they just change words to apply to different values. They receive two stars only because they did make some good points, such as teach by example, praise, and listen. However the rest of the book is filled with stupid games that no child I know would ever play. I, honestly, feel bad for their nine children who had to experience all these stupid discussions and games. Also, monetary awards do almost nothing for children, and that is the award type the Eyre's use. So, in effect, they are paying the childrent to play those stupid activities."
1,A Waste of Time,"Okay, the story isn't dreadful, but most of the characters are shallow. Compared to other books in this genre, this is a weak contender. The author attempts to convince the reader she is writing a ""Regency"" novel by overwhelming the story with adjectives such as ""jaded"" or ""cynical""--obviously all heroes must be dukes no less, who radiate such qualities. Nothing original here. Dozens of better authors exist--Lindsey, Coulter, Quick, Laurens etc. Don't waste time reading this one."
1,Disappointing....Silly Story,The synopsis sounded interesting and the reviews were good. I should have waited until other negative reviews came out. The story was silly. I ran out of patience and the book ended in the trash bin.
1,Regency lover,"Have been reading regencies since I discovered J. Austen and G. Heyer in my teens. This is a good read, fast paced and the characters keep you interested. The ladies of course have a very modern outlook, but I like that. If you enjoy A.Quick's books you will like this, also, S.Laurens."
5,a matter of enjoyment,"Suzanne Enoch has delighted me again with her follow up to Reforming a Rake and Meet Me at Midnight. This time Emma, the headmistress of a finishing school, locks horns with the overbearing Duke of Wycliff. Wycliff has escaped to the country to avoid marriage minded females, and to his terror finds himself attracted to the woman who teaches them thier feminine wiles. The duke wants to shut down Emma's beloved academy, but she is having none of it. They make a wager, and I can tell you, we all win in the end. Another great read. I can't wait for the next book!"
2,A Real Let Down!!,"Once again, I have fallen prey to recommendations. I bought A Matter of Scandal based on some very high recommendations. After getting 1/2 way through the book, I am very disappointed!! While I like the plot of the book with the wager, I felt that the story could have been better developed overall.What distracted/frustrated me most was the fact that Grey brought along his shallow friends and those simpering women!! They kept getting in the way of what could have been a more romantic, fun story.I think Grey's arrogance was a bit over the top!! He just really wasn't my favorite type of romantic hero. Emma was developed a bit more than Grey. If she had been paired up with a stronger hero this story may have worked for me.I am going to donate this book and a few of my other ""recommended"" books to a nursing home, hospital, or local library. Otherwise, it will collect dust on my bookshelf from lack of reading."
2,What awful people,"I thought this book was a disappointment. A really stupid 'wager' results when Emma refuses to pay her rent increase because the land-owner has a rich nephew, the Duke of Wycliffe, and he can afford to support them for free. Throughout the book all the characters say how arrogant he is (including all his friends), but its never pointed out that she's as arrogant if not more so than he...certain that she literally knows everything better than anyone else. Everyone over 18 in this book is shallow and selfish. Grey wants everyone to do things his way, she wants the same thing, his guests are leeches, his uncle is an idiot, Freddie is evil, Tristan is plotting against his 'friend' for a lark. Its definitely not the worst book I've every read, but I found the plot and characters very unengaging."
5,Best Family Muisc Out There,"This is the best of the best of Seeds Music. This is by far the stronest of the Seeds series with Crushed, The Good Song, Out of the Mud and many more great songs on this ablum. If you want a CD that the entire family can listen to then this is it. The added bonus is that it is pure scripture."
5,Mysterious and spiritual!,A self cleansing project filled with Oryema's life story. Includes the haunting tracks like Makambo which talks of his exile from his native Uganda and Solitude a song of comfort to his widowed mother. Makambo and Solitude are featured in the Pure Moods collection and also in Zalman King's movie Red Shoe Diaries.
1,A great source for capoeira DIS-information,"This was single handedly the most outrageous farce I have ever seen in my life. I don't even know how this got published. It is chock full of atrocious falsities, misspellings, and story-like nonsense. Aside from all that, the book is also told in a very racist context, and practicioners of capoeira know that capoeira unites the races, not creates something to segregate. Capoeiristas come in every age, gender, race, and nationality. I would definately advise writing to the publisher to get this book off the presses. This book spreads the disease of ignorance. Avoid this ""publication"" at all costs."
1,i put it in my trash can,"This book was a complete waste of my time and money. As I read it, I wondered if the author actually had any idea what capoeira is. I might be completely wrong, but I am pretty sure that the people of Portugal, who brought the slaves to Brazil, don't have blonde hair or blue eyes. I just feel bad for the rest of the people who actually bought this thinking they would learn about capoeira."
1,"African Brazilian ""Karate""?!!","At first I thought that the author's titling of the book using the word ""karate"" was a joke.""Capoeira: African Brazilian Martial Art""Now that is how it should've have been titled. Karate just doesn't equate with Capoeira. Any martial art having to do with ""karate"" is of course Japanese, or of it's influence thereof. It's really sad that this book has even gotten this far with a title like that. My suggestion? Shy away from this book."
1,An twisted an Racist look at capoeira,"This book not only contains false hoods about Capoeira, but also makes it to be percieved as a black against white issue. Capoeira is a martial art that uses fluidity and grace to master it. When one such as Mr. Salaam uses such racialy idealistic notations it clearly makes it out to be rigid and unliberating. All other books I've read on Capoeira are about the art itself, are informative, and very very well written, this is the worst exception, not only should this book be read as an example of what Capoeira is not, but what we all should not posses in our hearts."
1,Capoeira: A Dangerous Subject in the Hands of the Ignorant,"It is difficult to review this ""book"" due to the fact that it's very poorly written, it lacks structure, and it has no particular point or theme beyond its blatant pro-African American agenda. The sad thing is that there is a very powerful connection between Capoeria and Africa, but the author misses the point completely by indulging in ficitional (and often downright incoherent) tribal Capoeira fantasies, rather than delving into its the actual history and traditions.Poor penmanship can be forgiven, but this ""book"" is just plain irresponsible, without substance and grossley misleading to anyone looking for information about Capoeira"
3,A comprehensive view of Capoeira legend and history.,"This book Documents the cultural elements which fused to create Capoeira as a mode of self defense. The book is not Racist,as some comentaries state,rather it tells the story of Capoeira from the perspective of the oppressed Africans who created the Art. It was a tool of liberation! Capoeira:'African Brazilian Karate' is a resource for anyone interested in Capoeira and its African origins."
1,INCOMPLETE SONG,"I was unable to find the song ""dola dola""..A friend suggested to look on Amazon. I ordered the CD through Amazon. It only had half the song of something like 2.38 minutes. The longer version of Approx 4.25 minutes is avaible on youtube. I was disappointed and felt I did not get my due.Movie bride and prejudice : hindi audio music."
3,"Please: If you want bollywood music, get it REAL","Do not get me wrong, I loved the FILM. It was great and starred Ash my favourite actress (along with Rani & Kajol) :)My first problem with the songs is they should have been in Hindi. English is so bland and doesn't click and sound so good as Hindi. I consider these songs to be a poor imitation of bolllywood music, where the female voice of the heroine is high-pitched. Works there, but here it just sonds raspy.Then there is the whole basic thing of the subject, the male voice, ect ect. ect.Instead of this soundtrack I would reccomend the soundtrack to a real hindi film. Taal is very good."
1,Worse than a god-awful Bollywood Film,"I'm Indian and somewhat prideful in my home country. I don't care for Bollywood movies at all. But after seeing this atrocious follow up to Bend It Like Beckham (a superb movie to watch multiple times), I just had to see a Bollywood movie to wash this Bride and Prejudice garbage from my brain.It was like eating poo and then craving raw sewage just to get the poo taste out of your mouth."
4,fun soundtrack,"Loved the songs and funny lyrics. Just wanted to clarify none of the vocals are aishwarya's. In true bollywood style, all the major characters lip-sync to songs sung by others."
4,As delightful as the film itself,"The soundtrack of the film Bride and Prejudice is a delight to listen to and infectious. While listening to it I couldn't helping humming to myself or even singing aloud, not mentioning the private bathroom dancing I performed.The more I listen to the music, the more I am getting to like it, even those songs I was not so fond of when first seeing the film. It has a charm that grows on you gradually.The wedding song is funny and exotic at the same time, makes you feel part of a different, but exciting and rich culture. The song ""a marriage has come to town"" is one of my favourites, so are the 2 exotic and sexy songs performed by Ashanti. I was very happy when I saw that the song ""Arrogance, pride and vanity"" -which unfortunately was cut out of the film, although you can find it on the dvd in the Special featurette - is actually included on the cd.If you like the film, you shouldn't miss out on the soundtrack either."
4,Loved the Bride and Prejudice CD,My favorite song was #1 the Panjabi wedding song. I play it over and over. The reast of the CD I also good. I would recomend this CD to those who loved the movie.
4,funand wonderful,This cd is amazing. you definitely relive each scene as you are listening. Most of all is just cheerful and bring a smile to your face.
4,Energy music!,"Oh my. When I first watched the movie from which this soundtrack is derived, I absolutely fell in love with so many of the songs. After debating for several weeks on whether or not this soundtrack actually merited purchase, I ended up buying it.A Marriage Has Come To Town, No Life Without Wife, and My Lips Are Waiting (A.K.A. Goa Groove) are some of my favorite ""energy songs"" that I play when I'm looking to get hyped up or while working out. Unfortunately, it's hard not to sing along which garners some strange looks if there's anyone in my vicinity. However, it's well worth the pleasure it brings."
5,Love it!,"I was a little disappointed when I realized that I had ordered the soundtrack and not the movie, but my 4 kids and I love listening to this every time we are in the car!!!"
4,Three good Pooh stories,"This is a nice little selection of Winnie-the-Pooh tales, and the simple, sparsely-placed black and white drawings keep the emphasis on the text, which you might or might not this is a good thing.The first story involves Pooh eating too much honey and getting stuck in a hole; the second involves a hunt for a Heffalump which Pooh manages to foil (this story was recently made into a movie); the final story is a real charmer in which Pooh, Piglet, and the other members of the cast try to scrape together some rather dismal presents for Eeyore on his birthday.Children like Pooh, and this book does a good job of capitalizing on this fact to get a child to read, rather than just look at the pictures."
3,Find a window: creovate now!,"This is my first introduction to Martin Lukes, and I am horrified that so much of the jargon doesn't need translation.Is value-free marketing really so ubiquitous? Of course it is, along with its corporate siblings content-free ideas and process-rich bureaucracy, it flourishes in an environment where confusion is the new clarity.The book would be even more amusing - if it wasn't so sadly accurate. I think I've even attended jargon creation workshops with this guy: somewhere in a window between blue sky and green fields developments.Creovation TM sums it up brilliantly! (And if you don't know what that means, then you do need to read the book - honest).Read it and laugh or read it and weep: you choose.Jennifer Cameron-Smith(not written on my handheld BlackBerry TM or anyone else's, for that matter)"
2,"A few laughs, but has been done before","There were a few laughs early in Lucy Kellaway's lightweight corporate parody. The jargon wielding life-coach, the cringe of over-enthusiastic corporate re-branding, and anti-hero Martin Lukes' negotiation over how much he is prepared to commit to being ""better than the best he can be,"" make for some grins in the first few chapters.However the same basic device has been used before, and is better executed, in Matt Beaumont's ""e,"" and as the book developed, it reminded me more of a grown-up Adrian Mole, though without the comparative subtlety of that series, and lacking the capacity to reflect naivety of the main character in the way that Sue Townsend (and more recently Mark Haddon in ""The Curious Incident..."", ironically fleetingly referred to in this book) achieved.I was ultimately disappointed in this book because, although it does not position itself as anything more than light humour, it has to work hard to get to that, and it offers nothing more."
2,Soggy pain au chocolat,"I picked up this book for its 1) catchy cover and 2) author whose opinions and style I enjoy in her FT column. But I was disapointed by the dryness of the whit (borderline suicidal) and the lack of contrast between different correspondents (this is an epistolary novel). It seems the main character addresses his mom in the same way he writes to his wife/boss/colleagues/son. It's at times a colourful read but definitely not a gripping tale or an ""instant classic""."
1,It doesn't work,"The idea of narrating a novel through emails is not a bad one, but it doesn't really work. At least not in Who Moved My Blackberry. What starts out as funny ends up being tiresome, and the main character is too obnoxious and egocentric to keep the reader's interest. The book does show a corporate world that is shallow and somewhat ridiculous, and that might be good enough for an 800-word column, but it's not for a 368-page novel."
2,A monkey could have written this.,This book was bad. Really bad. Unfunny and just trying way too hard.
3,Not as funny as advertised,"The most important thing to know about ""Who Moved My Blackberry"" is that it is pure satire. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were read by Ricky Gervais, rather than just reading it cold turkey. Satire is a tough thing -- rather than relying on jokes or verbal cleverness for the humor, all of the humor derives (or doesn't) from the situation.I didn't find ""Who Moved"" very funny. It was a quick read, though; I'll give it that. I'm giving it three stars, even though I didn't enjoy it that much, because I did find it to be a perceptive view of corporate life. (Shudder.)"
4,Funny read for Blackberry Addicts,"Written entirely in text and Blackberry email exchange, this is a humorous look into the corporate world and relationships. If you're looking for a quick quirky light read, Martin and his antics will keep you entertained. There's a little something for everyone to relate to in this book.If you've ever had an annoying boss, an irritating co-worker, or known a ""brown-noser,"" you'll relate to the character of Martin. The karma that befalls him was enough to make up for all the drama I faced in the corporate world and hopefully you'll relate as well."
4,cause related marketing,The marketing of causes is now days growing issue. Mostly it has direct relation to under develop and develop countries. Even it is rightly said its main aim is to bring awarness and change in Behaviour in Individual inturn in the society. In other way with the help of this we can succeed in our objective that is change in Behaviour is Bottom line aim of any marketer of causes.
3,American Piano for european ears,"George Davidson's music was an incidental discovery for me and my wife while on holiday last year in Florida. We immediately liked his style and enjoyed his music. He is not only a virtuose interpreter of well-known compositions, but delivers some very nice compositions of his own.His piano style is not as ascetic as George Winston's, but his play is at the same time rich and relaxing. His virtuosity is not arrogant or imposing its will, but gently accompanying your relaxed thoughts as a listener.We want to say thank you for letting us enjoy his music."
4,Wonderful,My granddaughter loves this. She play's for hours at a time. The Barbie teacher is a must with this toy.
5,Brilliant.,"This album is such a great peak into the traditional music the way it was meant to be played. It made me a bit sad to hear so much chatter and noise on the solo singers tracks; if you ever go to a session I should hope you'll have more respect for a singer than that. Other than that the ambiance of the pub chatter and clanking pint glasses added to the feel of the tunes being played in their natural environment. The sound was fantastic and the players were superb. The collection of tunes was a good sampling of what you'd actually hear at many sessions and the switch from group performances to solo pieces kept it interesting and entertaining to listen to. If this album doesn't inspire you to play, dance or at least tap your toe then nothing will! Buy it, you won't be disappointed.Cheers,Johnny"
3,"Serves it's purpose, I suppose","This tray is a tray. The colors are more muted than the bright colors of the Twist Alea china collection. If it matched the dishes better, I'd use it more. It looks faded, and old, but a tray nonetheless. Not jazzed either about the quality of the material used to make the tray, though it is lightweight and relatively adequate for the price. Expected a little more for the Villeroy & Boch name, but it appears to be manufactured somewhere other than the dishes."
1,Disappointed!,The tray is cheap plastic! It is definitely inferior to the dishes. Don't waste your money.
3,just ok,"I should have read the specs a little closer as it's bigger then I was expecting. From the pictures I was expecting a smaller diameter. I guess it's my dough skills but my pies don't come out much ""deeper"" then when I use my regular pizza stone with a standard size dough ball. I've also had a couple pies stick to the bottom so have started using a little corn meal on the bottom"
2,Not the Same Stone,"I have had 3 stones like this that I bought at a store - I loved them, but they eventually break due to my own fault. Since I could not find it in the store anymore, I ordered it online. Disappointingly, it came in a plain brown box like bulk packaging and the stone did not look near the quality of the old one. I did not try it however, and sent it straight back. The Sassafras stones used to come in a nice box etc. - the way this was packaged make me think they just sold their name to someone who markets it cheaply through Amazon. Also, no longer made in the U.S. and with concerns about lead etc. in pottery made me question the source of the clay in this whole strange arrangement."
2,Too Hard to Keep Clean,"This baker does heat evenly. It works well for bakingfrozen bread and pastries. Pizza crusts crisp well.I like how the rim protects against pizza sauce spillsin my oven. So far there are no cracks or chips.However, after one use there was discolorationon the surface. I told myself that it added ""character""to the baker, that I was not ""obsessive"" like Detective Monkon T. V. about spots. However, after ten uses,the discolorations have spread and deepened.Personally, it bothers me.You decide!"
1,Not as represented.,"Made in Taiwan. Not impressed, since this is the company that made Pampered Chef stones. Expected it to be made in the USA. I never even used it, sent it back."
5,Wonderful Pizza!,"I make home made pizzas on a flat pizza stone for my family all the time. I've often tried making deep dish pizzas in a metal pan and they were never as crispy as baking on the stone. I purchased this stone to make my deep dish pizzas and they turned out fantastic! Crispy, crunchy yet soft and chewy crust, just like chicago style. I've thrown out the metal deep dish pan!"
5,"GRAND MOVIE...GRAND LADY, MARY OF SCOTLAND","I LOVE THE HISTORY OF THE CELTIC LAND AND ENGLAND, MARY AND ELIZABETH WERE TOUGH LADIES OF THEIR TIME.THE MOVIE WAS GRAND...."
4,good period piece,"This movie tell us about the live of Mary Stuart. Just because she was a queen don't think her life was perfect. It wasn't. She had to marry men she did not love, one was nuts, & was not allow to be with the man she did love. As usual Katharing Hepburn is great. If you like period pieces you will like this movie. There is a lot of violence in it also."
5,The Best,"I'm 62 and Windows Me is my first computer. I used a few other books trying to figure out how to work the system, but this one is clear and tells me exactly what do for just about anything I've needed so far. This one stays on my desk."
5,great book,I just purchased a computer with the Windows ME operating system. This book was very helpful and easy to understand.
4,Rusting steak knives,"Good knives but if they aren't dried completely they rust. Make sure if you get them, that you always keep them dry after using them or else you will have little rust spots all over them."
1,"Book Covers, Print Editions don't match!!","I bought this set of trilogies hoping to receive a decent set that have the same print editions as shown on the image. Instead, only 4 of the books are of the original print edition, the other 2 are from later print editions. You can tell as they book covers do not have the same style as the other 4. Also, seller stated that they are in 'Very Good' condition... they are not. All the books are creased, dog-tagged or exhibit some form of water damage. There's even a receipt that was provided that they bought these books for 3.79 each. If i wanted damaged books i would have paid that myself. I paid 60$ expecting at least Very Good condition books of same print editions... instead i got books cobbled together from a used bookpeddler that seems like he bought them from a public library. be careful dealing with this seller if you are looking for old books."
2,Dancing On My Grave,The book that I received was not the version that I ordered. The picture on your site was not what I received. I contacted the owner and they were able to give me a partial refund for the item. I am happy now.
2,I found the author to be narcissistic and self-centered.,"Kirkland's book includes a great deal of valid criticism of the ballet world; its recent emphasis on athleticism over artistry, the lack of real power demostrated by women and the change in desired body type from slender to anorexic. However, Kirkland comes across as self-centered, snobbish and shows no ability to take responsibility for her own problems (she derides ballet administrators and choregraphers both for treating its dancers and children and not saving her from herself). A little cheese with that whine, Gels?"
2,"A narcissist, depressing look at the dance world...","...and really, it's not always that bad. While this book may give a behind-the-scenes look at the demanding life of a dancer (I know, I am one), it seems more like Kirkland was attempting to make readers pity her. If she wants people to admire her for what she did in her life... it's not happening. She may have been an amazing ballerina, I'll give her that, but writing is obviously not her strong point. Stick to the stage, Gelsey!"
1,"If you want to study a clinical Narcissist, Gelsey's it","This biography could be the study of a clinical narcissist. Kirkland expounds on her adventures in plastic surgery (silicone lips and breasts), drug abuse, anorexia and promiscuity. Finally, she finds love in the arms of a fellow cocaine addict, who sounds like (and resembles) Norman Bates with literary pretensions. I felt sorry for the other people who had to come in contact with this self-obsessed prima donna on speed."
3,The Abusive World of Ballet,"As interesting as I thought this book would be - and to an extend it was - it was also very repetetive and not somehow at all what I expected.Gelsey's relationship with Ballanchine was a 'needy' one. Maybe she relates to all men in that way. Her drug abuse and simultaneous dancing is hard to imagine. Her descriptions are much too technical and the book is too long, it could have been abreviated.I just think her story could have been presented in a more interesting way. I was not taken in by this book."
2,"Fascinating Psyc Case, Frustrating Dancer","True,Kirkland should be commended for her ability to tell all; few dancers mention anything in their books to put them in a bad light. Nevertheless, I find her to come across as completely self-absorbed, so much that she can't even really let herself go as a dancer. God forbid, she actually ever let spontinaeity take over! And as far as I'm concerned, there's no excuse for all the trouble she got herself into. The vast majority of professional dancers manage to swim rather than sink, and she could've done the same. Still, it is a fascinating book because of how the workings of her mind are put so blatantly out on paper."
5,MY MOST FAVORITE BOOK,"I have read this book at least 10 times. Anytime I am between books, I turn to this one and I can flip to any part and get completely immersed. I am constantly recognizing additional bits here and there, almost hidden between the lines, that are very relative to my creative journey as a dancer as well as my emotional journey as a human being. I love this book and I will treasure it always."
4,Good glimpse of her life.,I thought Ms. Kirkland's book was a good glimpse into her everyday life as well as her mind and what being at the top of a top ballet company in the 80's was like.
3,"Intriguing plot, vulgarity spoiled the book","I bought this book because of the intriguing plot, the credentials of the author, and the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the vulgarity and profanity which added no real value to the story brought me to a point of tossing the book in the trash before I got to page 100. John Dicke is certainly an author who can weave a good story but this story was littered with too much unnecessary trash. I am really saddened that I will never know how this story turned out."
3,Fooled me with title track!,"Okay, so I know the title is ""Blues Dream"", but the album is classified as avant garde jazz, and that's what the title track sounded like! But when I got the CD home, I discovered that it had a decidedly country sound to it--not something I'm into at all. I don't think blues necessarily equals country, so I have to say that I was disappointed with ""Blues Dream""."
5,Sweet Dreams,"I was introduced to Bill Frisell by way of John Zorn's freakout band Naked City. Quite some time later I was at a local indie record store and while browsing through the ""jazz"" section I stumbled upon ""Blues Dream"". I thought ""Hey that's the dude that played guitar in Naked City!!!!!"" I didn't know what to expect from Bill on this album and I knew that it probably wouldn't sound anything like Naked City but I threw all caution to the wind and bought it. After listening to ""Blues Dream"" a couple hundred times I came to the conclusion that this is quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded. There is not one weak spot or one bad song on this album, all of it is AMAZING!!!!! The jazz, blues and country styles all work very well together. Now if you'll excuse me I think I'm gonna go listen to it again.Standout tracks: Blues Dream, Ron Carter, Outlaws, What Do We Do?, Greg Leisz"
3,"Okay, not brilliant","I'm a Frisell fan, and while there are a few gorgeous tracks on this, it doesn't fulfill the promise of the title. For those who collect Frisell, go ahead and get it. For those looking to buy one or two of his recent works, I'd go with Ghost Town and Intercontinentals (or Nashville)."
5,Reminds me of old times...,"i can honestly say that rarely have i ever been seriously disappointed by a frisell album, and that dates back to when they only came on that black vinyl stuff. i heard him first with eberhard weber and have been captivated by his expressive playing ever since. (he was on lyle mays' first solo album too... a strange combination to be sure, but amazingly listenable none the less) a clarinetist in origin, he seems to be able to play the guitar as if it has a reed...blues dream is the first recording in a while that i've been really really excited about listening to over and over- this time not so much for frisell's playing, but rather the compositions. i guess that, having grown up in the 'heartland' but as the son of a jazz player i was never able to quite reconcile the bluegrass i heard coming out of the radio with the jazz coming off of dad's turntable. this album is thereapy for others simularly situated. why haven't you bought this yet?"
4,WELL WORTH IT,"I am using the 4-OUTLET High Performance Powercenter to protect a HD LCD TV, PS3 and HD DVR. Even without using all the Coax and Phone protection circuits, this is good insurance against the loss of expensive components."
2,"Disappointing,from such a great artist","I personally love Hassan's music. However,this is not one of his best albums. The problem is that it is too synthesized.His singing is wonderful,but they changed the music to something overtly western,which takes away from the inherant power that lies in gnawa music. However his last album ""The Gift"" is a marvel,in which he shows us that he can properly mix traditional gnawa rhythms with western and other musical styles."
3,a little rough,"Saw him perform live summer 2010 and he was fantastic. Want to find a recording that captures that energy. Was hoping this might be it, but while it has its moments it's a bit rough and inconsistent and production quality isn't the greatest."
3,Good ideas for starting a watercolor painting.,"If your looking for different compositions to try out in watercolor, this books fits the bill.I liked the great descriptions of compositional techniques which is followed by large color painting examples.Some of the painting examples scream for you to do them better. What a challenge!"
2,For those who can't DRAW,"Take a load of old t shirts, dip them in paint and throw them at a canvas. Roll your car over the canvas several times.Tear up some cardboard boxes, spill paint onto the torn pieces and press into a canvas. Use random colors as well. Blindfold yourself.Stand on a ladder and drip paint onto paper or canvas lying on the floor. Throw feathers and macaroni into the drips.Using a squirt gun filled with paint, stand back and ""create"" your painting by squirting it on. Rub your naked body into the wet paint. Dance in it.THIS IS A BOOK FOR THOSE AFRAID TO DRAW OR PAINT. AFTER ALL, WALKING ON A CANVAS WITH PAINTED SHOES CAN BE ""FUN"" THEY SAY. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE LEARNING TO DRAW FROM NATURE IS JUST OLD-FASHIONED AND NOT WORTH THE EFFORT? I DOUBT THAT TO BE TRUE."
4,Jem not just for kids in the 80's,"I was in college when this cartoon came out and it was my little sister's absolute favorite, favorite show(right up there with He-Man, She-Ra, GI Joe, The Transformers and the Thundercats). She had all the dolls, even the Misfits. I got hooked watching it with her. Sometimes it would be on in the mornings as I was getting ready to leave for classes and I had to watch it. It was a fun show to watch. Now I have daughters of my own and I want them to get to know Jem, Kimber, Shana and Aja. I got them a couple of the episodes, but I definitely want to see the rest. I am so glad Rhino put the first two seasons on DVD.My little sister will be thirty this year and I know she will get a big kick out of seeing this show again."
5,The Holograms bring back great childhood memories!,"This all-girl cartoon rock group was so great[that], I never missed an episode. The Holograms had great songs, and storylines, and their lead singer JEM was just one of the kind, thanks to the amazing singing talents of Britta Phyllips. The Misfits were just as great, the Holograms weren't the only ones.(...)"
5,"Truly, Truly, Truly Outrageous","I am soo happy that Rhino has decided to release Jem on DVD. I was such a big Jem fan in the 80's and still am. I love the characters, the stories and the music. Jem is the best cartoon of all time. Rock on Jem!!"
5,Jem Girl (for life),"I grew up on this series and it was great to watch it again. It's a great family show -- love, action, adventure, conflict, developed characters -- with multi-plots that engage adults and kids alike. I forced my family to watch it with me and now they're hooked! Showtime!!"
5,Finally,"I am so(...) happy I don't have to watch Jem with scratchy video tape interference anymore! It is AMAZING to watch this come in clear and with a clear audio stream. I won't go into how awesome Jem is of course, because if you are reading this review, then you are probably already a fan. The extra's are really interresting and both the writer and the voice of Jem would gladly do it again if they could. So keep those online petitions going people! The writer and voice actor are on our side!!! BRING BACK JEM! BRING BACK JEM!"
4,Truly Outrageous...almost,"I've been waiting for Jem to be released on DVD for the last few years. Finally, the wait is over. The audio and video quality is amazing, as are the storylines, animation, and music! I am in awe.However, there is trouble in paradise:There are some audio problems with the episode ""The World Hunger Shindig"" on disc 2. The reprise of the song ""We Can Make a Difference"" at the end of the episode is mixed in a bizarre way. Also, the vocal tracks in both of the songs ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" and ""Share a Little Bit of Yourself"" are totally out of synch with the music tracks.Please don't let one glitchy episode ruin an otherwise amazing animated series and 4-disc DVD boxed set. You will be blown away!"
5,So 80s-a-fied and awesome!!!,"I used to watch this show when I was a little girl, and I'm so happy that I got this dvd. Now I'm 21, and Jem is still the coolest!!! Also, the dvd is for an awesome price...I have been watching Jem all evening!!! However, I never realized how wild the show is!! I guess I was too little to understand...Eric even backslapped Jerrica!!! I almost fell out of my chair!! There are a few glitches on the dvd, but to me they were more humorous than upsetting. I mean, come on, it's from the 80s, and we all know there were all sorts of crazy mistakes in cartoons if you look close enough. Anyway, I think every 80s child (or girl at least) needs to own this. It's definitely an important part of our childhoods. That's all I have to say, now I have to watch Jem defeat the Misfits (who, on a side note, are some really crazy and spoiled broads)!!!"
1,hmm its the 80's all over again??,i remember watching this show it truly does bring back memories i used to watch it and say what the world was thinkin??i am glad RHINO is releasing older toons from the 80's atleast they could do is bring back HE-MAN or teenage mutant ninja turtles.if you want a good 80's toon get transformers instead of JEM.anyway just thought i'd mention i already have this set on DVD and nothings changed.. dont get your hopes were are not the little kids we USE to BE!!!
5,OUTRAGEOUS!,"This DVD collection is totally awesome! I loved JEM as a child and wondered for years why they never repeated the episodes. I brought his home and watched all the episodes and loved each and every one of them! I can't wait until the release the other seasons. This is definitely a great buy and I cant wait to share the magic and truly outrageous characters with my young nieces. Growing up, there were few cartoons that would catch the attention of a young girl too old for care bears and JEM was definitely a cartoon to enjoy!"
4,Blast from the past... blasting the neighborhood kids,"The Jem story is awesome, the music is great, and the dvd quality is acceptable considering it is such an old cartoon. The only thing I did not like was the cover art. Couldn't you find someone older than 8 to draw it??? Otherwise I loved it! When are seasons 3 and 4 coming out??? The neighborhood kids come over and ask to watch Jem daily and we all want MORE!!!!!"
5,LOVE IT !!!,I was soooo excited when I found out Jem was coming on DVD.The box is really cool.The DVD's are amazing.Very very clear.I've been watching them with my daughters (12&9)and they love Jem.Here's for hope season 3&4 comes out !!! :)
5,Jem & the Holograms,I had been trying to get my hands on these DVD's for quite some time. I am so grateful for the set. It is everything I remember and more from the 80's! LOL! I also was able to get it for a great price! Thanks!
3,Truly Outrageous!,"If you grew up loving and watching Jem, than this is the DVD for you! It it totally awesome and made my day!I just hope the next Jem DVD is even better! The interview with Samantha Newark is kinda boring and all she does is talk about what a wonderful singer she is.....She was just the speaking voice of Jem...not the singing voice!Otherwise...I loved every minute of it!"
5,"Jem, come back!!","I LOVED this show when it was on, and I still love it, even after all these years. The problem is, the DVD is out of print, and if I want to own it for myself, I'm expected to pay $100. I'm a college student! I can't afford that! When will Rhino rerelease Jem on DVD?? I would buy it the day it came out if it ever does."
2,Good reference only,"I have used this series (Complete Book)for years. I must say this book is so minimal. Lacking on information on each subject, just a bunch of fill in charts without descriptions. Good as a reference, but is you want this as a science book--keep looking."
5,Great supplement for 5th grade science!,"I found this to be a great addition to my science curriculum. It has good pictures and diagrams, condensed information, and some interesting experiments. I teach in Texas where testing is everything, and think this book will help my students be even more successful."
4,review of books,The book should have more explanation of the subject instead of constantly asking children to do exercise that he/she have no idea.
3,Good Supplement -- But don't attempt to use it alone,"I am a Homeschooling Mom, and am teaching my 5th grade son this year. I love the book, but my main complaint is that it dives right into the worksheets, with little or no preamble about the subject. The student is expected to know (for example) the names for all the organs in the digestive system, and be able to label them.I find myself having to go to various websites on the Internet and begin our lessons there, then go to the workbook. If I'd realized that I'd have to do that, I may not have purchased the book.We do love the experiments, and as I said, it's a GREAT supplement......."
5,Science Workbook,"If your budding scientist wants to stretch their knowledge outside of the core math, english workbooks. This workbook adds great variety to their curriculum and will challenge them on concepts they cover in school. Its always good to get these workbooks 6mth-1year before they cover it if your child is a little advanced."
4,"Beautiful, dated, but still useful.","The styling and recipes in this book reflect the time in which they were encapsulated, but they're still beautiful nonetheless. We keep it on the coffee table in our Southwest rental house as a primer to Southwest cooking and culture for out-of-town guests."
5,Still timely,This whole series of cookbooks is a joy to own. It is certainly coffee table quality and you will enjoy every recipe. I purchased a new one for myself and one as a gift for my sister-in-law. You won't be disappointed with the quality or the recipes.
5,Southwest: The Beautiful Cookbook,"If you love Mexican food, you will love this book! As with all of the books in the Beautiful Cookbook series, the pictures are beautiful. I place my cookbooks in a stand and display them as artwork."
2,Don't buy because of software,"Panasonic voice recorders have a proprietary software with VM1 files. So if you lose the disc, get a new computer, whatever, and you have the old vm1 files, YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK! To read the files anywhere else, you have get conversion software to change it into an MP3 or Wav, but it still requires the original software to do it! It's a mess. To buy the software from Panasonic, you have to have the serial number on the device. So if the device broke and you threw it out (as IU had done) they wouldn't sell me the CD with the software to read the old files!"
2,I would not buy it again,"I was very dissipointed in the recording time versus quality.On the best quality recoding mode the results were dissappointingly poor.I could not get the included software: Voice Editor 3 to work. Worse yet,I can not get the program off my PC.Bottom line, I would not buy it again and I do not recommend this recorder."
1,Faulty!,This product was very faulty... It started out great but within a day or two the impulse was very slow and even with new batteries stopped vibrating all together.
1,DOA,"This item arrived dead! There was no damage to the box, this item just didn't work. And Amazon doesn't allow exchanges for this item. I called the manufacturer and they told me to return it to the store where I bought it and they would exchange it. Well looks like I'm stuck with trying to have my bank recover my money from Amazon."
1,for completests only...,"What a waste! This is not an ""encyclopedia"" at all...it's more a like a presskit for the ""Hulk"" movie. After reading it, I had gained NOTHING in the way of new insight into one of Marvel's oldest characters. In fact, the sections of amatuer psychological analysis is embarrassing to read. While not 100% happy with volumes one and two, which I purchased at the same time as this volume, the previous books stand mountains above this exspensively-printed drival. There's a good reason why the book is wrapped in cellophane - Unless you are a fanatical completest, skip this volume. The same author is atributed to the upcoming Spiderman volume, but unless it's more inline with volumes one and two, I won't be buying it."
2,"A great overview of the Hulk, but NOT an encyclopedia","First of all, this book is probably a great buy for Hulk fans if you want some background on the Hulk in comics, TV, animation, and the new movie. It also includes three comic stories- the first Hulk story, a sample issue of the current series, and the issue of the Ultimates with the Hulk. However, anyone looking for a repeat of the terrific X-Men Encyclopedia, or even the mediocre Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 1, will be disappointed, as there is VERY little encyclopedic information. (One reason I think it's a bit unfair that it's shrinkwrapped- in stores, you can't tell what you're getting.) The Hulk Incredible Guide by Tom DeFalco is MUCH better for that."
2,Cant complain much more than these guys...,"As many people said about Vol. 1 of this set, this vol. seems to just be a big advertisment. So far vol. 2 was good although it was missing some stuff, but this was just flat out an attempt to get you to go see the movie. and as for the spiderman volume, guess what comes out around the same time? yep, so that volume probably wont be much better than this one. What the hell Marvel?"
1,Shameless Movie Tie-In that is Awful,"This book has nothing to do with the old Marvel Universe books. It barley has anything to do with the previous Marvel Encyclopedias. It is a child's introduction to the Hulk. Otherwise, what a waste."
2,"So So ""mystery""","This was not so bad as to totally disregard it but the book holds only by the sheer amorality, sex and violence of its contenst. Remove those three elements and all you have left is a story with a lot of partial sentences, a zillion uses of the ""F"" word in every variation, uninteresting foul-mouthed loathsome characters, paragraphs that never seem to end and as much excitement as watching a bird feeder in a snow storm."
2,It is not very durable...,"I did not purchase this through Amazon; it was through Back to Basics Toys. It was a Christmas gift for our 7 year old son. Granted the age on this toy is 5+, but our son is interested in regular pool, so we figured it would be neat to get this so he could get the idea of what it was all about. Yes, it's a fun game...if you can get through it without any pieces falling off and/or breaking! Just received our replacement Skittle Pool in the mail today and, already, it is broken. It truly is a piece of garbage as far as quality goes. It's all plastic...the ""A"" frames (two are included) are warped, making for total inaccuracy when ""shooting"" the cue ball. The plastic piece that sticks up out of the swivel arm (which a stationery cue ball sort of gets inserted on) snapped off ~ one of the reasons we needed a replacement game...and then one snapped off the replacement!! For the price, I would think they could invest a little bit more money and make this game a bit more sturdy."
2,"Poor construction, but decently fun","Table under felt is plastic, not wood and therefore not very flat. This is mitigated by the fact that the balls don't have to travel far, but obviously a flat surface is the most important quality aspect of this game.The swivel ""aimers"" are not constructed with precision. One is very tight and sticky, which is very annoying, and the other loose, which is less annoying.Still my 4yo is having decent fun and probably improving his coordination."
2,Skittle Pool Table,"This is a nice game, but not very child friendly. It is difficult to put together and difficult to make shots. Adults might very well enjoy. I had also sent one to my son when he was deployed to Iraq. There was some enjoyment there. Overall I would not recommend this game."
1,My9 yr old son writes....,This item is poorly constructed. Never buy this ever! It might look like fun but the poor quality just stinks. JUNK! I think this is a rip-off. The pendulum is fun looking but offers poor control.
5,Highly recommended,This site is wonderful for quick delivery and the product has never failed to work. Definately would use it again if needed.
2,Not a pitcher - perhaps a gravy boat?,We had this item on our wedding registry and were very surprised when it showed up -- it's definitely not a pitcher. Be sure to look at the dimensions because you'd be lucky to serve more than a single glass of any beverage. It might be handy to use to serve sauces or gravy but for those purposes I would want a tray underneath. We returned ours because we couldn't figure out what to use it for and purchased a reasonably sized water pitcher instead.
4,A fine overview,"This is an excellent book with terrific photo's. The pictures and text give the history of some bamboo types, leaf/wood samples, use in the garden for both visual effect and to build with. Bamboo's versatility in the garden extends well beyond just adding an Asian flavor to an area. That said, my only critique would be the need for a better way the species can be identified. You can figure out plants to the Genus using this book, but nailing which plant species it is can be foggy. Mr. Bell did a great job introducing a new plant for most gardeners."
4,significant highlights,"not as moving as some of the other work of Nusrat, but songs like the title song and Nothing Without you are up with his best"
4,Hypnotic beats - entancing treats!!,"An excellent collection of some of Nuzzy's finest stuff.I first heard Nuzzy when I worked in an Indian deli,but didnt think too much about it.I was made curious of his work when i saw that massive attack were fans and remixed some of his stuff.I have a few of his albums and not one of them fails to capture the power and hypnotic effect of his music.Muust Muust is certainly worth a look for anyone with an interest in world music and massive attack's remix doesn't play around too much with it,just adds a liitle more to the backround beats, excellent."
4,New take on qawwali by the master?,"This CD is interesting, thought maybe not a great introduction to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and qawwali. Many of the tracks are experimental versions of NFAK classics-- such as the title work ""Mustt Mustt"". The cadances are different from much of his other work and the instrumentation is interesting- lots of electric instruments and sound effects. If you are interested in mixing the contemporary music of the west with contemporary qawwali this would be a good choice. If instead you want an accessible, yet fairly authentic introduction to the style that made Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan famous, get ""Akhian""."
2,Very medioce stuff from a master singer,"This CD presents the magnificent voice of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and some of his regular musical family playing with Western musicians, and treated to the ""enhancements"" of studio technicians and DJs. For those unfamiliar with him this may well be a knock-your-socks-off experience. However, for those who have been followers of Nusrat's career this is watered down stuff indeed. It is ironic that after the usual diddling/remixing which seems a necessary part of pop music recording today that the result should be such a limp product compared to his ""old fashion"" performances. Clearly producer Michael Brook simply wasnt up to dealing with the incandescent power of the real Nusrat. If you think this slick production is great stuff - listen to his untampered with qawwali recordings and have your heart medication handy, 'cause you ain't heard nothin yet!"
5,Made a visual differnce,"I have a 720p projector and it always seemed to be a little dull in color and contrast. I have tried a few of the free calibration tools like you get on some Blu-rays. But this disc went it to high detail of every aspect you need to look at in order to calibrate your tv or projector. I am happy with how it turned out, I just now have to set it up for a few more settings, like TV, PS3, etc..."
4,Worked great!,"Worked great for me! It's all pretty subjective, but if you take the time to do it right you'll get very good results."
3,Powerful but Complex,"Good price but, not for the faint of heart. It seems to have alot of info and help. But you need to know a little about this stuff or be willing to brush up."
1,Absolute crap,"I purchased this DVD on the recommendation of someone who supposedly understood video calibration. After attempting to use the DVD to calibrate my TV twice, I just gave it up. It's useless for all the reasons that the other one-star reviews here have stated. Simply put, if you think you can use this tool to calibrate your HDTV, think again. You'll soon discover that it's nothing more than an exercise in futility, and wasted money."
2,Digital Video Essentials,Found it rather disappointing. I have the original video essentials dvd and didn't find anything on the blue ray version to justify replacing it.
2,Horrible direction,"I tried to use this, but half the time I have no idea what they are talking about. The directions that are given are really unclear and you really don't even know when you are supposed to make the adjustments. The narrator just keeps going on and on about stuff you will not care about unless you are a film director. Instead of telling you what to do in simple terms they will spend 15 minutes talking about why a TV should not have a sharpness control. They keep talking about CRT's and front projectors, I am not even sure if this is for an LCD. Good luck trying to use this."
5,Very usefull tool and great source of information,"Using this disk for adjusting my new plasma's user controls was so easy. Using test patterns to correctly ""dial in"" my color, tint, sharpness, etc. rendered a very accurate image. The patterns on this disk stayed on the screen for as long as I needed them to unlike another I have used that ""time out"" too soon. I also learned a wealth of information from the tutorial section. You too will also understand why competing manufacturers sets look so vastly different while you shop for your new flat panel. No home theater tool box should be without Digital Video Essentials!"
2,"Complicated, Repetitive and Overdone","I bought this DVD to calibrate my new 58"" Samsung plasma. All I really wanted from a calibration disk was ""do this 'til this happens"" or ""adjust this to look like this"". This DVD gives you the history of TV, of DVD, and makes the actual calibration of the TV far more difficult and convoluted than it needs to be. You pay for a history lesson. You might as well just look up how to calibrate your TV on the internet using Blu Ray disks like Ice Age or Dark Knight or whatever. Oh, this isn't really relevant to the functionality of the DVD, but the narrator's voice made me wanna sleep 5 minutes into listening to it. Consider buying something else in my opinion. :)"
2,Garbage !,"Do not buy this. it is not exactly what you are looking for. this goes to in-depth with the history of contrast and color, etc. all i wanted was screens to set up my TV and this has that but just not in the way you want. In my opinion...but the DISNEY WOW calibration disc. This is what you really want !"
1,Worthless,This DVD did nothing to help improve the quality of my plasma TV. I followed as best I could the instructions but I set my TV up initally and the calibration setting never changed after following the instructions. Save your money and either use the factory setups or set it up to visually to satify your own preferences.
3,To technical for me,Good product with lots of info about HD and what it all means. Just a little to technical for me.
3,Waaaayyy too complicated for me.,"We wanted to try to calibrate our new flat-screen ourselves and save the $200 for a professional, so we bought this. It's has EVERYTHING you could possible need and NOT NEED on it. It was so detailed that we could not follow anything (and my husband builds his own computers, so we're not tech-dumb). After spending nearly two hours with watching and trying to use the tests, we gave up. The Geek Squad will be over today to take care of it for us. I give it a 3 because it has great info, just way to complicated for the common man. Also, the sound quality was pretty bad..."
1,A complete waste of money!,"Very confusing & that's after you watch hours of the history of HDTV. After trying to follow the not so easy instructions the picture was way worse than before I started. My Blu-Ray's & DVD's looked horrible after following this disc. Had a much better picture just by setting the TV to movie mode, very happy with the picture now. Wish I had not wasted my money on this product."
4,Great for Optimizing HDTV,This DVD has in depth information as well as great test screens for getting the most out of your HDTV. Does a great job of explaining the different features that affect picture quality and the technology changes specific to HD. Title menu is a little cumbersome.
3,Too Much Information...,"Tons of really great info on HD, but not a lot of it useful to the casual user. While it offers dozens of test patterns, only a few are in the set up section of the video for use with basic control ( color, brightness etc.) These do a good job, but no better than what is found on any DVD with THX Optimizer.From a technical viewpoint, there's everything you ever wanted to know about how this stuff works. But most folks, like myself, are buying this to do a home calibration. Save your money. I was able to set things up pretty quickly after viewing a couple of times, but the picture was no better than what I had tweaked from ""eyeballing"".The advertising is misleading. It really IS a calibration disk, but without access to the cal. menus and the proper equipment, it's not much use to me. You CAN get a pretty good picture from the basic setups, but you can get settings from Tweaktv.com or Cnet that work just as well. Save your 20 bucks and buy a Bluray disk you'll enjoy watching."
4,Very helpful,"This DVD was very helpful in getting my new Samsung TV looking great.The only downside is that it is VERY long winded. Unless you are dying to know the entire history of high definition TV, skip right to the test patterns. There is sufficient information with the patterns to get your TV calibrated."
5,Dont wait..get this now!,"Excellent calibration Blu-ray. I recommend all that owns HDTV's to purchase this disc and calibrate your sets. A full ISF cal would be the best, but this Disc will do 90% of the job.Great Blu-ray calibration disc..."
1,I am not impressed...,"Like the other reviewers have already stated, the test pattern for contrast doesn't seem to work. I can see all the steps from black to white no matter where I set the contrast. Also the color decoder doesn't seem to be correct. The instruction say to start by setting blue levels, and then the red and green should be correct. This was not the case. Not only did my picture look better at the factory setting, but the red and green still did not match. I tried to correct this by adjusting the tint, but I was on my own since there is no instruction for setting tint."
1,Do not buy.,"So, I should start by telling you I have a 1080P LCD set I bought a few years ago. Once I bought it (like three years ago at Circuit City) I noticed that it didn't look as good as some of the store display models that had been calibrated. I noticed at the store they were showing The Hulk and it looked awesome, so I bought the same movie to try to make it look as good. I got pretty close, and I was happy with that. I recently realized it didn't look as good as I thought it should, so I bought this disc. Worst. Idea. Ever.This disc is so boring, so ineffective, so lame that I feel someone owes me my $19 back. I followed the (lame, boring) steps and the tv doesn't look much better. My next step is sit down and watch a newer movie and calibrate myself like I did the first time around.As for the fact that this disc shows you stuff about HDTV works? Yeah, but so does the internet. For free."
1,take some aspirin before veiwing,"This is the most painstaking torturous accessory you can purchase for your home theater. Hours of garbage information with monotone robotic narration.The menu layout looks like it could be straight forward and easy to use but far from it.all i wanted was to know how to use the basic test patterns and what the correct settings should be, not listen to someone go on about every irrelevant detail from 4k transferring or how a cinematographer decided to do color timing on a piece of salmon on a plate.WAY too much talk about system formats and equipment that are completely irrelevant to the flat screen/blu ray combo you picked up on sale at best buy.i wouldn't take this again if it was free or force any of my friends to use this."
2,Surprised at the praise,"I purchased the DVD to adjust a 50"" Panasonic plasma TV. I tend now to think that these things are the toys of the compulsive. The actual number and degree of adjustment that you will likely encounter is borderline trivial. The final result is certainly trivial. The problem is not that it's too technical: in fact there is far less there than meets the eye. Perhaps the Panasonic comes so artfully adjusted there is no need, or alternatively the exuberance noted in some of the earlier reviews is rationalization for that ""compulsive's"" purchase habit. In any case - save your money, or if you are determined to buy... lower your expectations. I've used mine exactly once, and if you want it, pay the postage and you can have mine!As for the retailer, Amazon has always proved reliable and a great value. You have to love them, even when you fall prey to your own compulsiveness."
4,Probably a good tool to have for an HD TV.,"I do believe that this product is well worth the money it costs. I only purchased it to use the test patterns. To figure out how to use them, you have to go through rather long and boring sections of the video. They should probably sell a disk with just the test patterns and a pamphlet on how to use them. I would have paid more to not go through the other stuff on the disk."
3,I see a difference,"i definitely see a difference in my picture quality on Blu-ray and when watching HD channels. The only thing is that it's not as easy as it says. there was some unnecessary info given that could be left out to make the process quicker. The instructions are not for someone that doesn't have experience/knowledge with electronics. Overall, if you don't want to pay $400-$600 for professional calibration this is the way to go."
1,Essentialy Useless,"I was able to accomplish more using my own eyes and ears than I could with this disc. I repeatedly started at the beginning, thinking I was missing something, but after running through the same material over and over again and wasting many hours, I finally gave up and returned it."
3,Necessary??,"This was a very informative Blu-ray but for the Plasma TV units I have, I did not find it very necessary. A lot of the features these TV's have already make the picture look great. Call it personal choice or whatever, I just played with the features my TV's came with a chose the one I liked, much easier. Though I did learn a great deal from the rest of the program the Blu-ray came with."
3,Good Tool for a Not So Good Price,"This is a good tool, and guide, for calibrating Full HD video displays and audio system set-up so you can watch Blu-ray movies at its best. I think the price should be less that what they're selling it for. I got this for about $16 but I think it should be around $10 max. This is a tool that will only be used for once every year or every six months at the most. I don't think it should be priced like it's a commercial film."
4,Really made a difference,"I bought this DVD hoping to improve the image quality on my 46"" Samsung. I can understand how some reviewers said this was difficult to use. But by studying the included video instructions (it takes an hour or two) I was able to significantly enhance image quality using only my eyes and the included filters.Someday I hope to use this with my Eye 1 color calibrator and some free software on he internet but for now this has helped a lot."
3,It's ok - but needs a refresh,"Like others I used the previous DVD version of DVE many years ago; when you watch the newer Blu-ray DVE you don't get the feeling much time has gone by. The video and narration both feel very dated and the explinations could be better. However, the test patterns can help you adjust your screen, and the audio tests can help you set speaker levels. They also can help identify phase or other problems in your system. I haven't yet used other calibration disks but can't help but feeling this could be done better. I give it 3 stars because it does work, does both video and sound, and is less expensive than the others."
2,Very Difficult to Use,"I tried and tried to make heads or tails out of this calibration system. I beat my head against the wall and never made much progress. Then I triedDisney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray] and had my TV completely dialed in within about 45 minutes. The HD Basics was full of interesting content, but it just wasn't very easy to use.It was frustrating to me the way the test patterns were interwoven with the instructional material so that you had to play the instructional videos and then pause the test patterns at just the right spot. The Disney WOW disc was easier to follow, because it was organized by concepts and then sub-categorized by instructional content and diagnostic patterns.Bottom line, I couldn't get a good result with the HD Basics."
3,"Made a difference on my Picture, not the easiest to use...","This is a great starting point when trying to set up your new HDTV. It wont make your picture or sound 100%, but its a great starting point.My issues are that it is not the easiest directions to follow. It gives you instructions that do not always make sense, and some of the areas where it says you will get a pause sign to do your adjustments either don't get the sign or it is right in the middle of the explanation of how to do the process.I was also quite surprised how all the ""display"" pictures given thru the show look to be shots from the 80's. Isn't there some updating we could do here???All in all, it was worth it for me, but for someone who doesn't fully understand picture settings in a TV you may find this quite difficult..."
3,Lot of Effort,Takes a lot of going back and forth to watch then try to recall all of what they are telling you. Seems it could be a lot simpler.
4,A Good Start...,"This is my first product purchased for HDTV calibration and it does its job well.The menu was a little confusing at first but then it all made more sense as I went through it more often.The information in this Blu-ray disk is good...some of it is a little over the top for those that aren't into knowing the technology behind HDTV but for those tech guru's you'll enjoy the info.As for the most important piece of the puzzle the actual calibration part...I was happy with the results...my picture improved and that's all I was looking for...to make sure I'm showing the best picture possible for my viewing enjoyment.The cost wasn't bad, so can't complain...it's worth every penny...for a good start...if you want to dive in deeper then hiring a professional calibration service is the way to go."
1,Not worth the buy,"This disc is not user friendly nor does it explain what each test pattern is properly used for. They just throw the test patterns and expect average users to know what each pattern is supposed to do. You are going to need a meter, if you are going to take some advantages of the test patterns provided. The basic contrast or black level,or even seeing all ""red"" , ""blue"" or ""green"" by using the filter provided don't help either. I recommend AVCHD from SpectraCal. Its free download that you can burn on a DVD - R, and can be use only on a Blu-Ray player. Other options to download for HD-DVD or other compatible players as well. Save your money and spend it on something else."
1,Very technical product,"Product is very technical and not easy to follow. It needs a companion manual to follow along so you can figure out what to do. No explanation of how to use all of the test patterns. This product is very good if you know how to use this stuff. If you are a novice, buy the Monster Calibration Wizard. Very easy to use."
2,VERY Basic.,"This is a VERY basic instructional video and tool. I was very disappointed it left out a lot of adjustments that NEED to be addressed. It makes NO reference to gamma or tint/hue settings which greatly affect everything else you are trying to calibrate.The voice instructions give a nice education of how and why certain standards and goals came about in televisions, but it severely lacks detailed instructions on how to use their test patterns for calibration. It just breezes through it and still leaves you with questions.I was disappointed at the lack of instructional content and guidance. The three-color filter board that came with the video was covered in glue and the green filter was folded over and glued in making it useless as a color guidance tool. I tried going to the producing company's website but they have no contact information nor does their forum work."
2,No Instructions,"This DVD does not show you how to adjust the colors, It does explain how the tv works but I bought this to adj. my tv. I am at a lose as to be able to use the patterns it has, no explaination for use."
5,Bring's out the best in your HDTV,"Wow I have a 55"" Element HDTV, and wanted to get the best picture possible, and wow it really do work and it has paid for it self, I do all my friends new and old hdtv now because they ask how does your tv look better than my LG, lol so you can't go wrong with this, its a must have item!!"
2,little hard for the average person..,"Only had a chance to use this once, didn't really like the way my tv looked after i adjusted it.. will have to go through and try it again to see if it comes out any better.. was a little time consuming, and harder than i expected..."
3,DIY fine-tune your TV,"Tweak your screen for best pix using your BluRay player/PS3. More limited than than a Pro getting into TV's ServiceMenu, but cheaper. Out of the box, TVs are set wrong to grab attention on display in a store."
3,A good start,"I bought the product based on the reviews, its good but not good enough. Its designed to help you with a basic HD setup and its probably all you need for most of the budget displays and projectors. You need a lot more than what's available on this dvd to get the best from your high end equipment, like getting a pro or using higher end calibration software/hardware if you know what you're doing."
4,Useful,"I found this to be useful in checking the audio and video. I would like it to have more detail and more detailed tests. The information was basic but interesting and the tests, again, are basic but useful. It does lack any test for tint and backlight but overall I am satisfied with it. I think it would be better for many if the tests had some audio prompts with them, doesn't seem like that would have been difficult to do."
2,Need based on TV quality,This product is wholly unnecessary if you've got a half-decent television. Most televisions have settings that are 85% accurate to begin with.Only worthwhile if you want to know as much as your TV calibration expert.
2,Wow - Very Dissapointing,Ok - nice to check my audio for the speaker play - but other than that...lousy for adjusting colors / sharpness / etc.Lots of filler stuff...NOT IMPRESSED!!
3,Not working on XBOX 360 HD-DVD Player,To my dismay this HD-DVD (as of 31 Mar. 08) is not working with the Xbox 360 HD-DVD player add-on.I pre-ordered this movie and was anxiously counting down the days until I received it.I gave it 3 stars because I can't rate the HD-DVD until I use it.Hopefully there will be an update soon.I seem to recall reviews from the prior version of this DVD needing an update on the 360 and it eventually was released!Lets cross our fingers and hope for an update soon.
1,Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics (Blue Ray),"This product was imported into Europe. It is a Region 1 disk and it will not play on players requiring Region 2.Disappointed that Amazon did not advice of this, it must have been obvious to them."
1,DVD a dud!,"The DVD did not play on any player in our house. After further review, this is common for MOST DVD's. Why sell a product for DVD players that doesn't even work?!? They do not even have technical support to contact."
4,Great for beginners and semi-professionals,The Digital Essentials disc is great. I am very familiar with JKP products and have been happy with them all. The instuctions are perfect for those who are new to calibrating their first HDTV. I feel this product is great for semi-professionals because there is a huge gap in the industry for Blu-Ray test discs. I only thing I thought was missing was the window patterns of primary and secondary colors for calibrating color decoders and white balance while using a meter. The disc still has white window patterns at all IRE levels so white balance calibration is still easy and possible. In no way would colored window patterns be useful for anyone but an ISF calibrator. Great buy and I recomend it to anyone.
4,Worthwhile purchase,"DVE HD Basics provides help for setting up your HD audio/video system. The disc is much more helpful than the Avia 2 disc, though the original Avia disc provides more audio calibration, I thought. This is the only calibration program I'm aware of that is provided on Blu-Ray with HD video test patterns. It is helpful to watch the 90 minute presentation before starting your calibrations, just to understand what the adjustments are and how they affect the overall picture."
3,"Good for video, not for 7.1 audio","This has a great historic tutorial of HD and provides great video calibration screens. I was very disappointed to find that even though the jacket claims TrueHD audio, it only supports 5.1 and not the 7.1 audio of TrueHD."
3,Good not great,"Maybe I wasn't patient enough, but man was this DVD confusing at times. I only want to calibrate my TV, nothing more, yet I continually had to sit through LONG explanations on every small detail. I figured I'd just skip the lengthy tutorials and jump right into the tests but the tests themselves aren't clearly explained. With that said, the disc was great for setting the brightness and sharpness values on my TV. However, I do have a feeling that any Pixar blu-ray disc would have similar tests. I really wanted to adjust my color settings on my TV but those tests were either too confusing or absent altogether.I'm giving it three stars for two reasons. One, at some point I'm going to apathetically sit through the long tutorials and try to really dial in my TV. And two, if you know what you're doing I'm betting this DVD will help you out more than it did me."
5,Essential is right,"I've used the DVD version with excellent results so I had to have the Blu Ray edition. I think this tool is a must if you're at all serious about home theater. Some of it is technical, but there is a wealth of information here. Perhaps it's too much for some, but there's also an option to jump straight to basic setup. If you take the time to go through the tutorials, you should be rewarded with a significantly better picture and improved sound. Just setting brightness, contrast, and color correctly made a remarkable improvement in my home theater experience.The Blu Ray version adds info on HD video, has sharper video demonstration material, features Dolby TrueHD sound, and is easier to navigate. I wouldn't set up my system with anything else."
1,waste of time and money,if you want to know how much knowledge this author has about video tech then get this if you want to tune your tv use THX FREE ON SOME DVDs
2,Horrible,"I'm not an expert on HD TV's but I bought this hoping it would help me tweak the picture therefore achieving it's full potential. First of all, the program has so much useless junk in it and then when you actually get to the test patterns (the chapter that explains how to use the test patterns) it is extremely vague and left me almost where I was to start with. After using the disc, I basically wound up with exactly the same settings that I had picked myself after simply playing around with it and making personal adjustments. Anyone knows that if you turn the brightness way up...or even a little too far up it's going to look too ""bright."" I researched other's calibration settings online and as long as you follow the basics of starting with the movie mode making sure to stay away from the ""torch"" settings, you'll be fine. To me the video was a complete waste of money and waaaayyy too cumberson."
3,Not bad,"Not the most intuitive DVD, but there are some cool things in here. I was able to improve my TV picture with this. The DVD should not be used for a total calibration, but as an additional calibration tool. Here is what keeps this DVD from getting a 4 Star review:-cluncky menus-poor DVD layoutIf you dig through the DVD, it makes sense, but this could have been put together better. Good info in here though."
4,Works fine,I had the older version of DVE Basics so when we got a Plasma set I wanted the blu ray version which seems to work fine. I didn't see any major improvements though so i'm not sure I needed this
1,Waste of money,"Should be a $5 item.The DVD provides a 90 minute dissertation on the history of TV broadcasting and then a few test patterns. Minimal guidance on how to use the test patternsEssentially we get:* 2 patterns to control brightness - very easy to use* 2 patterns to control contrast - very easy to use* Multiple patterns to control sharpness - absolutely useless with modern LCD HDTVs* Multiple patterns for ambient light - Absolutely useless for modern LCD HDTVs* No help on controlling color temperature, although it's a major chapter in the DVDThe DVD is also really a pain to navigate.Really disappointed"
2,irritating dvd,"The vast majority of the content on this disc won't help you adjust your televisions picture. There is WAY WAY too much irrelevent technical talk that misdirects from the info that actually is important. The rambling filler on this disc really tests your patience. You have to replay key parts repeatedly to remember what you're really supposed to do with a test signal. If you own a popular tv model, try looking online to see if you can find a review where they list the way they tweaked the TVs settings. I found this on C-Net for both my tvs and tossed this disc aside."
2,Not a helpful tool,"I got very little value for the money and time I invested in this DVD. The DVD is mostly concerned with making you understand how the TV manufacturers are not adhering to what it considers the holy grail of achieving the standard defined by a good CRT. It repeats this ad nauseum. There is a lot of technical detail, but not much how to do it. It kept cautioning against just trying to eyeball a pleasing fleshtone, but there was so little I could achieve with the DVD, that I ended up having to do just that. I could not find anything, ""quick"", ""straightforward"", or ""easy"" in this frustrating product. Arlen Ring"
3,Just OK...,"I have purchased travel photography guides in the past. Some have been excellent while others, just so-so. This one is just so-so. Personally, I didn't care for the format of the book as it divided the state into sections. Also, directions were given assuming you were traveling in a specific direction. Come from the other way and it is a little more challenging. Want to photograph covered bridges? Some are in here, but there are a lot that aren't. The maps in the book were not of much help either. Twice we failed to find the site we were looking for based on the maps and directions that were given. Only after asking locally for directions did we end up in the right place. The book did give some insight into locations for us to visit, but overall we didn't use the book much."
4,Picture-taking in Vermont,"We recently returned from a week in Vermont. Unfortunately, the weather was variable, but we did manageto visit a number of locations suggested by David Middleton in his ""Photographers Guide to Vermont"". Thebook was well-written and very helpful. The images included were wonderful. David's pro tips and sidetrip suggestions added another dimension to our trip. The book was very readable with some touches ofhumor.. We look forward to our next trip to Vermont, where this book will be one ofthe first things we pack. We are members of a competitive camera club, always on the lookout for great picture locations. It was almost like having our own guide. Thanks, David.Barbara and David Pike"
3,nice guide but,"nice guide but much of it is grossly overated, out-of-date, too much bs in it.Directions good but the backroads-ugh. his Maine guide is better."
5,as good as describe,it is a required textbook in my course. The book is very useful. I don't think I can get an A without the book.
2,Way too expensive,"I bought these cranberry beans for a trial because they were advertised by dr. Oz for good health, they were expensive and had to pay a horrible shipping price. They are way over priced and not anywhere near worth the shipping cost. My opinion is I like the beans but I will never order again and I wish I had my money back."
3,Purely luck???,"The idea of this movie is that some people can steal luck from others.The idea is brillant, but this movie could have been so much better.I'm a big fan of foreign movies and I have seen this one on the shelf for years, but just got around to watching it.The story moves at a good pace, but sputters in several places before a so, so ending!Intacto (Intact) is worth seeing, only once!"
2,"Interesting premise, poor editing/storytelling","A one-line summary of this movie makes it sound fascinating: Proven lucky people (sole survivors of plane crashes and car accidents, for instance) compete in high-stakes, ultimately deadly ""Who's really the luckiest?"" competitions. It's a great concept, really, but it's told in a very confusing, poorly edited way so you never really quite understand what's goin on. There's some references to people's luck being drained from them when one of the other luckies touches them, but this is never really explained satisfactorily. The characters' storylines are never really fleshed out to let us know who's who and what their relationships are to each other. Still, there are some nice moments in the film...the scene of all the blindfolded luckies running full-speed through a dense forest until only one is left standing comes to mind. Sadly, the whole of the movie is far less satisfying than parts such as this."
4,Sustained by a lucky force,"Luck can be passed to person to person, or sucked out of someone like a liquid. Do you have what it takes to sustain your lucky streak? When will it end? The main characters put up all of their valuables, for the thrill of winning, and for claiming that they indeed do have the best luck in the moment.Directed with a somnelent hand, the director takes us into a realm where bets are placed on fate.The pace is at once odd and ethereal. The viewer is thrusted into an underworld where the stakes are high, and the only the lucky survive, again and again.There is a plot with elements of justice, love, risk, and redemption. The denouement could have been longer, but the viewer is not lucky enough to see more.Russian roulette with FIVE bullets is normal, especially when you are clad in all khaki in a desert somewhere, in a ... survivor's casino.The story is original.The acting is first rate.Like an oneiric gamble on life and death."
3,Not as good as it looks,I saw the preview and really wanted to see this movie. First of all I thought it was in English...it wasnt. This isnt bad the preview makes you think it'll be in English. The movie was slow at some parts and not as fast paced as the preview makes it out to be. There are better foreign films out there.
4,Not bad.,"This story was a bit different in the sense that it deals with gambling in a very creative (albeit deadly) way that I have never seen before. At first I was a bit lost but as the movie unfolds you catch on eventually. Tying a Holocaust survivor into the mix of main characters and which also served as the basis for the ultimate form of gambling was quite clever. The plot deals with luck and fortune, superstition and perhaps a touch of magic.Although there are some scenes that are suggestively graphic (violence) there is a quality to this movie that helped me relax and did not over-excite me before bedtime. The cinematography is quite beautiful and the musical score were, for the most part, quite soothing which probably is why I felt so relaxed instead of jolted (as some movies can do). Just thought I would describe the feel of the film as it provided a different vibe and was a pleasant welcomed surprise."
3,Intriguing- A very clever premise......,"I didn't know what to expect at first watching Intacto. A movie about people stealing each others' luck would ordinarily sound ridiculous, but despite skating the edge of credibility, Intacto has a lot of style and some scenes of quiet suspense. I am also a huge fan of Max Von Sydow, and he is clearly a standout in this movie as the Jew, a man who is able to convey his uncanny ability to survive deadly games as almost a tragedy. His conversation with the main character Tomas (also very good) is quite touching. It seems that even though many of the characters in the movie have incredible luck, the luck in the end seems to be more of a curse than a blessing as characters throughout the movie are unable to get enjoyment from their ""good fortune."""
2,"Good Size, Bad Machine","I have been through a couple of this model, unfortunately I need the small footprint due to where I put it. But it's basically a piece of junk. I've gotten around a year out of each before they go bad, though the buttons on the remote get temperamental well before that. Also, these were recalled a while back due to their occasional propensity to catch on fire / spontaneously combust. But if you can ignore all that it's a nice small size."
1,"Broke after a couple of weeks, noisy, overheats","I just wanted a cheap little DVD player to put in my daughters room for occassionally viewing Disney and Barbie movies. Unfortunately this lasted only a couple of weeks.When she told me it wasn't working this evening I told her to turn it off and then on again. It wouldn't turn off and wouldn't stop spinning the disc.I had to move her dresser out and unplug it so it would stop spinning the dvd.I plugged it back in and even though it's not turned on, a couple of hours later it's extremely hot.We'll be trashing this one unfortunately."
4,This is a replacement for another Coby player,"I just had a Coby DVD-209 player shipped to my address today. It was a mere ($30) replacement for a (free) DVD-207 model I got about two years ago, which no longer works. Shortly after plugging it in and trying it with two DVDs I find it works just fine. No complaints with packaging or transit issues either. And given my budget, I'm a satisfied customer."
1,cheap!,"I like a bargain, I don't want bells and whistles that cost a bunch, but I don't want to purchase an item that someone has rightly dubbed -a ""throw away product"". This item is just that. It is so cheaply made that is is guaranteed to break within the first six-months of use. I know this because my daughter bought this for me for my birthday and it stopped working (no picture/no disc error message) within 2-months. I was sucker enough to send the item back at huge expense (no free returns here, cost me about $20) and received a replacement after another 6-weeks. The replacement literally blew-up after about one month of use. I turned it on one evening and 'pop' and a stink and it was gone. Do not buy this product. Let's save the earth and support quality workmanship not throwaway junk."
1,Do Not Buy!,I received the Coby DVD player for my birthday. I was very excited since this was my first DVD player. It died after 3 months. It simply stopped working. It will not turn on! I contacted Coby customer service and they said they would send me another one for $31. Isn't that just like buying a new one? I would not recommend this DVD player to anyone.
1,defect!,"I bought this item and not even three weeks later it quit working, the power won't turn on and it completely quits on you, don't order it!"
1,Garbage backed by a garbage company!,I ordered this player from Fingerhut and unfortunately didn't try to use it until the time to return it had expired. IT HAS NEVER WORKED FOR ME. The Power/Stand By light comes on and stays on and that is all it does. It will not play anything. I tried to call the Coby customer service and you never get through to anyone. From what else I've read even if you get through they will charge $31 to replace the player which is more than the $29.99 it sells for new at CVS. Don't buy it unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit I'm contemplating filing against them.
3,quality depends on....,"I had a Coby mailed to me, and while not faulting the USPS or the handling at amazon, something must have happened to the unit going from point a to point b. The player would be loud with certain discs and refused to play others.I bought the self same unit at a store in my neighborhood and the player works like a dream and is very quiet. It has played every single dvd I have put in it, even DVRs. So maybe the unit doesn't like the extra jossling it gets when mailed....What do you expect from a machine that costs less than $50, a good dvd player can only be had at the cost of over $50. If you want a region free (has to be hacked, but it is easy and won't break the unit), light weight and traveling player (this can take 110v to 240v), this might be player for you."
2,does not work with some dvd,"does not work with some dvds that are a little old or used a lot by public. It's a picky dvd player, i mean"
1,Don't waste your time!,Works OK except for two things - very loud as other reviews have said and this one has broken way sooner than their 90 day warranty. The problem for me is that I do not want a new one! Will pay for a better brand.
1,won't read all disks,"I have only had this product a few weeks, and so far, it's only played one of my dvds. It gives me messages of ""invalid disk"" or ""no disk"" for the other dvds I've tried. These dvds work on other machines in my house. I really wish I would have kept the box so I could return this."
1,Throw-away player,Bought it. Played a DVD on it for 2 hours and the unit failed. Other DVD players in the house have had no problems at all and have worked non-stop for years.Save yourself time and money. Purchase a quality item instead of this throw-away player.
1,worked OK for a while,"where do I even begin to describe what I thought would be an extremely handy little machine? oh yea, it didn't work!It never worked.I had 3 big issues with this machine. from day ONE, there was a disturbance in the picture that came and went. this disturbance resembled bad tracking on a vhs but I got the player cheap ($10.) and tolerated this one flaw.next, this dvd player frequently overheated. the picture seemed to freeze as a result of the heat. I placed the dvd player on a trivet in an effort to improve air flow & kept the top clear of anything and everything. as a result, the dvd froze less frequently but it still froze occasionally. next, the dvd player died.I barely got ANY use from this machine and when it was operational, the preformance was very poor.full size or compact, I'll never buy anouther coby dvd."
1,doesn't work,"I bought 8 of these batteries. They do not hold a charge beyond 3 days. Bought from a reputable dealer, major electronics company, so I assume they are not counterfeits."
4,Good but Eneloop rocks,"I checked the break-in cycle results on this usingMaha Powerex Wizard One MH-C9000 Advanced Battery Charger and Analyzer - Free Deluxe Storage Case Includedwhere the reviewer found these to be close to the stated 2000 mAh capacity and they also had charge right out of the box as claimed at couchcricket[dot]com. So I purchased these.So far I have been happy with the performance and for daily usage I perceive no difference between these and Eneloops. Though on specs and paper, Eneloop wins."
4,Great,I have four sets of these for a ZoomH4n recorder and so far they work great. I'm getting more for my xbox controllers and flash lights. Good run times so far with heavy use.
1,buyer beware,"i purchaced this item for my daughter's big x-mas gift. she already had a unit that was less in cost but wanted a more powerful unit. i made this purchase ONLY because under TECH INFO it says it has 3 speakers--2 L/R and a stand alone SUBWOOFER, WELL IT DOES NOT HAVE A SUBWOOFER!!!!! i beleave this to be false advertizing. i can get no help from any one to resolve thie problem so i intend to take leagel action."
4,A satisfying end to a richly detailed story of life and love,"Now Face To Face extends the complex story of strong BarbaraDevane and her quest in untamed Virginia for stablility andanother chance at life and love. An incredibly engrossing anddetailed story, Ms. Koen pulls the reader into a tumultuouswhirlwind of desire and despair, triumph and tears. It isthe perfect conclusion to the lives that we have beencompelled to know and love, or love to hate."
4,Not what I expected......,"Where to began, 1st of there was no love or romance in this book as the first, 2nd As many other readers have commented there are vast time gaps on certain events.3rd seems to be no happy endings at all except we know there was a wedding of some sort and the return of Hyacinthe. There was no searching for him or inquiry to what happened in the 2 years of his disappearance and to whom did that to him. 4th in my opinion to much day dreaming or flashbacks."
3,Three-quarters of a book,"I thought that 'Now Face to Face' was a wonderfully written 3/4 of a book. However, I felt very cheated at the end. Why develop the stories of Hyacinth and Duncannon when they are just thrown into an epilogue at the end? I certainly don't read a book for the romance, but I felt that aspects of this book were like a daytime serial...stay tuned for the next book. I would have preferred an extra 100 pages to do some of the storylines justice. For those of you who enjoyed this book (and I did), I recommend Dianna Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" 4 book series. It immediately follows this time period and Ms Gabaldon NEVER cheats the reader of experiencing important scenes."
2,So-so book that doesn't have much of a plot,"The author is obviously a good writer, but there were too many characters doing various unrelated things, especially in England, and there didn't seem to be a plot! It was just a series of vignettes of different people, none of whom I could keep straight (especially since the same people were called by various names and titles, i.e. the Duchess did this and the Duke did that, etc.) There also wasn't hardly any character development and I didn't know why anybody was doing anything they did. It was vaguely interesting but would have been much better if it was about 1/3 as long and more to the point (with a plot!)"
3,The First One is Better,"Once I finished reading ""Through A Glass Darkly"" I was most anxious to read the sequel to the captivating story of Kathleen Koen. But, as I finished through, what seemed like five chapters, I had to put it down. It seemed that all Barbara searched for was meaningless sex and compassion. I just had to put it down. Something in Barbara's attitude really put me off and, I am sorry to say this but, I could not finish the book. It seemed that everything went to the pits. Maybe others liked it, maybe others disliked it too but this is my opinion and I say it could have been better."
1,This book is torture,"You know you can't get through a book when you find the supposed ""heroine"" of the novel is utterly repulsive. Barbara seemed very lascivious and manipulative despite her claims to have ""reformed"" and (possible spoiler here) they killed Jane! This book is horrid. I was dissapointed and I would second the person who claimed it was not a well-constructed storyline. I agree. The plot seemed distracted at best. At worst, it was downright confusing and annoying. I don't care if I am the only one to give this book One Star. I know poorly-written literature when I read it. This is the first book I have had to FORCE myself to read. Don't waste your money. If you have to read it, find a library."
1,Hijackers,"I liike Through the Glass Darkly and was looking forward to reading Now Face to Face, but obviously it is out of print. I am not so interested in reading it that I would pay the exhorbinant prices that are being charged for a used book. I understand the concept of supply and demand from my college economics class, but really, I would be ashamed and fear for my soul if I sold a used book at such prices and certainly can live without giving my hard earrned money to hijackers for a novel. Koen's Through the Glass Darkly was good, but irritating at some points, so I cannot fathom why people would actually purchase books at hijacked prices, which results in even more higher prices for everyone else. Retarded!"
3,Not as good as The First Book,"I loved Through a Glass Darkly, I fell in total love with all the characters, felt i was a part of the story, cried, laughed and couldnt book the book down at all!! After I finished it and found out there was more to the story, I ran to the Library to get Now Face to Face, and was heartbroken. The book was not as good as the first one at all. I was happy to find out what was going to happen to all the characters in the book, but read it slowly and it did not keep my interest at all."
5,Great Sequel..Almost as Good As The First.....,"I read Now Face to Face years ago when it was first releashed and I have two say that I have yet too read such a great 2nd book in a series!! I loved the first book Through A Glass Darkly and still have a copy of it in my favorites book shelf!!! I wish there were a third book to this series!! This book is a great historical fiction novel. It is not just fluff, it is a true historical fiction novel!! Read it, you will love it too, but make sure you read the first book Through A Glass Darkly first."
3,disapponted,"I was devastated by Roger's death in the first book..I finally forced myself to read this sequel..but I am disappointed that after more than 700 pages, everything was summed up in just a few pages...she went to France and got married to a man we know little of, Hyacinth was not reunited with madam...what happen to the plantations in America? Did Therese go to France and open her dress shop????...I wanted Bab to remarry but I feel we were denied the joy of her marriage. We learned nothing of the husband, other than he was the best friend of James lll, The great pretender....grrrrrrr"
4,Not as good as Through A Glass Darkly,"Now Face to Face continues with the story of Barbara Devane, picking up when she lands in Virginia. In alternating chapters, we also see what is happening back in England at the same time, with the Princess and Prince, Wharton, Diana, and the rest of the crew.I didn't think Now Face to Face is nearly as good as Through a Glass Darkly. Barbara comes off as such a flat character in this book, and is almost....dull. I had a hard time getting interested in the parts that featured her, especially when she's in Virginia. IMO, the Virginia part could've been left out entirely and the book would've been so much better for it. I did really enjoy the plotting and intriguing going on in the English royal court; Koen is one of the best when it comes to that."
4,Great follow-up.,"It's a fantastic follow-up to the first novel, however, it left me feeling as if there was still more to the story that wasn't covered in this installment of Barbara Devane's life. Perhaps a lead into another novel?Good read that keeps you up late into the night!"
3,This can't be the end,"I feel like a possible romance between Barbara and Tony had been building since TAGD. Otherwise, why make him better looking, becoming more and more like his grandfather (i.e. worthy of the title of ""duke"") and the constant mention of similarities between Barbara and her grandmother. I imagined that the epic romance of Alice and Richard would be re-invented through Barbara and Tony. Anyway, I hope that comes to fruition in a sequel. Otherwise, I'd say I'm dissatified if this is the conclusion."
3,Not Through a Glass Darkly,"I read this book immediately after finishing ""Through A Glass Darkly"". While I enjoyed the previous book very much, I think that the sequel did not uphold my expectations.The things that I found interesting in this book was Barbara's story after arriving in Virginia. The life she shares in America with her slave and servant were interesting, but I found the second half of the book to be a little slow. Also, the hints at her relationship with Slane were somewhat irritating. Where Koen fleshes out her relationship with Barbara's husband and other lovers in the first book, she seems not to give us enough of this in the second book that I would rather it have been left out altogether.Overall, this was a good book. I saw another review of it where the reader had not read ""Through A Glass Darkly"", and seemed to enjoy ""Now Face to Face"" despite that fact. I would probably recommend them read with some time in between so you won't be disappointed like I was."
2,very disappointing,I must be the only person who didn't care for this book. It seemed to me that Ms. Koen wasn't sure whether to write one or two novels and wrote one that just isn't good. She seemed to be setting the background for her next novel rather than just writing a good novel. She is a good writer. It is just a shame that she seemed to be going off in two different directions at the same time. She didn't seem able to bring the two stories together. She didn't do justice to either the Jacobites or the tobacco growers of the south.
2,Too much historical information,I loved Karleen's previous book Through A Glass Darkly but this sequel did not live up to my expectations. The political and historical info provides a meaningful context and is somewhat interesting but too much of the story reads like a history book - too much emphasis on politics of the time.
2,broke first time using,"I liked this game that I played at someone else's house. I liked this version rather than the straight vertical poles on the ends. I like the graduating rails. It's too bad that the connectors are made of such bad plastic that the first time I disassembled it, most of the connectors cracked or split and fell in pieces. I contacted the company, and the pieces are on back order. That was about a month ago. Very disappointed in the construction and/or plastic used to make the connectors. Or were they dry-rotted from hanging around the warehouse. Still waiting..."
4,Have fun !,"I like it, it's fun... but you have to walk back in forth, buy hey, more exercise is good. A skill game like bags."
4,Awesome backyard game,"This is a fun game, especially after you've thrown back a few. The poles are steel, but the jointsare made of pvc, so don't leave it out in a storm because it may get blown into a fence or tree and break (like my old one did). Be wary about purchasing from boardgames.com. they're customer service is terrible and i an still aiting to hear back from them about a set or yellow bolos that did not come with my order."
2,Does not do the game justice,I bought this version of the popular ladder toss game thinking with the design that it would make for a funner game. Stick to the normal goals. It takes time to put together. The bolos that come with the set take away from the game...cheep! For the price it's not worth it. I did find better bolos on amazon from the BlongoBall company that work better with the set.
2,It Broke,"Had this toy for ....oh about a month, and it broke. It cannot be fixed, we still have to balls on string, but the actual toy broke, the legs broke off and the bars bent. the kids had great fun with it for the few weeks that they got to play with it."
2,Missing Images (Kindle Version),"I have just started reading the book (the kindle version). Many of the images are missing ""due to rights"". Please consider this before buying the kindle version."
3,A monetarist without a leg to stand on...,"Professor Friedman argues that the Great Depression was caused by the Fed's reluctance and ultimate failure to provide sufficient liquidity to the fiancial system in order to save it from collapse. This is pure folly, as the Fed cut rates from 6.0% to 1.5% during 1929-31, during a time when the money supply did not decline until late 1930 and early 1931, while the stock market fell nearly 75%.While some counter with the argument that Smoot-Hawley Tarrif Act of 1930 (which took effect in mid-1931) caused the Depression, nations such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, the Dutch East Indies, and South Africa all began raising tariffs in 1928-29 against a backdrop of commodities price deflation and a collapse in currencies.I am sorry, Professor Friedman, the Great Depression was caused by misinvestment, excessive credit expansion, and structural collapse in the international credit system. Sound familiar (October 1998)?"
5,Restrained beauty,"This is a beautiful book and a number of poems in it are at the pinnacle of Ashbery's achievement. There is a musicality in some of these poems that is sometimes lacking in some of Ashbery's longer, more prose-like works. A number of these poems are breathtakingly beautiful. In parts there is a sad undertone of loss and mournfulness, which adds to the poems' detached beauty."
1,If you think about upgrading to PA 2 PRO ****WARNING****,"BE ADVISED - When you install Poker Academy 2 Pro you have to be on-line and register, using its key, for it be verified and allowed to function. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS ONLY TWO TIMES. PERIOD!!! If you install it on a desktop and a laptop, fine. But that is all! If you want to install it again, because your computer hard drive crashed or you just wanted a new computer, forget trying to install PA2 Pro again, they won't let you. It happened to me and when I emailed support they just ignored me. Apparently you have to buy a new key at the going price to install PA2 Pro again. They said only 2 installs per key and THEY MEAN IT."
3,O. Schipani,"Enjoyed the characters in this book, but a bit disappointed with it's finish. Coming to the last few chapters of the book it was decided to put alittle twist to it. For what reason I do not know. Will there be a sequal? I hope so. For I would love to hear how she brings back a character back to the living and for what reason was he pretending to be dead."
4,Stack - 'Above All' (Gear Fab) 4 1/2 stars,"Looks to be the obscure Los Angeles psych / garage band's sole lp. Way I heard it was this album was initially released on (literally) a handful of copies - as few as ten actual copies were manufactured in 1966. Could you possibly get anymore obscure that that. Just the same, I'm loving what I'm hearing on this must-have CD reissue. Tracks that more than make this disc a keeper are the almost pre-Zeppelin like seven-minute ""DA Blues"", the powerful ""Cars"", ""Everyday"", the awesome ""Time Seller"" and ""Hot Days"" which certainly makes for good road music. Line-up: Bill Sheppard - vocals, Rick Gould - guitar, Buddy Clark - bass, Kurt Feierabend - rhythm guitar and Bob Clark - drums. Highly recommended for fans of Human Beinz, Thirteenth Floor Elevators, The Monks, The Fugs, Shadows Of Knight, the Seeds and Blue Cheer."
3,Several examples but it's doesn't go deep,"the book feat some examples but they just covered by a quick snapshot doesn't go deep, it's not a good preview from internatinal branding stage"
4,Tokyo Sketches Is For Lovers Of Japanese Culture,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The references to both American and Japanese culture were quite refreshing, and amusing to those who know background information on Asian culture. I, having grown up Asian-American, giggled at many of the references, understanding what was meant. The stories are short enough to make you want to read them and not be worried about not being able to finish, yet long enough to delve deep into the lives of the characters. Great details and description draw readers in. The endings make you wish for more and wonder if there was some mistake -- if a page was left out at the end. Some personal favorites of mine were The 48th Ronin, It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, and The Magic Word. Every story is truly a masterpiece. I couldn't put the book down even if I had to!"
1,If you need good padding protection..this is not it!,Not what I expected. Very thin cork strip .005 thousand of inch on the flat side and all metal on uneven concave side. Just how am I suppose to use the cork padding if it is on the wrong side (Flat side). The other side (concave side will not ride flush with the vise jaws. Bad design and cheap cork padding on the wrong side that is needed. Wasted $24 bucks (including shipping). Not a happy camper!!
4,A book based on reality!,"Most people, if you ask them, think that there isnt really that much of a problem of teasing people based on appearances. This book prooves them wrong! There is a girl at my school who in fact is teased, not because she is fat, but becasue she is skinny. This book is a great book because it helps enlighten people on how the world really is!"
4,You will have to ask yourself...,"Lara Ardeche believes she is living the perfect life, perfect beautiful family, popoular beautiful friends, pageant winner, she is blond and thin. Until she starts spontaneously gaining weight. Lara doubles in size and becomes something that is totally alien to what her family sees as important: she becomes fat. Her friends seem to melt away and her family comes apart.Lara must learn to love herself no matter what. She has to honestly examnine what is really important to herSelf.Life in the Fat Lane will ask you to examine your own self to find out where your own self image is rooted."
5,I loved this book!This is a page-turner and great read!,"Lara Ardeche has the world at her feet-perfect body,perfect home,awesome boyfriend,and is THE most popular girl in school.Until....she wakes up to find that she has a metabolic disorder that doubles her size.Lost and alone,Lara and her family,who is now slowly breaking apart,move to Michigan where no one knows her and she is now the new fat girl.There,she makes new friends,learns to slowly start healing,and finds out that being thin......isn't everything."
4,"Beautiful, Well-Written Novel","I recently read this book and found it thought-provoking and insightful. It deals with the controversial topic of judging people based on their appearances. We all claim we aren't as shallow as that, but deep inside, we really do discriminate. Cherie Bennett captures the essence of that prejudice perfectly, teaching her readers valuable morals. Are appearances really that important in judging others' characters? Before I read this book, I admit I was a bit prejudiced when it came to people with obesity. This completely changed my feelings on the subject. Though at times it can get depressing and a bit too honest, this is a must-read for any teenager who is faced with or is just plain interested in the topic of weight gain."
5,Page Flipper,"This book is defently a page flipper. At first you think oh another teen book,but when Lara gets this sickness you think wow i have to find what is happening. For people who are dealing with a weight issue or a weight disease should defently read this book. It is very inspriring and Lara becomes almost an inspiration to the reader.It is a 10+ in rating."
3,Come view the other side of the spectrum!,"This is a book that deviates from the norm. Instead of what you see on television, it shows you how life would be from both perspectives. We see the same girl with the same personality go from goddess to dust in a matter of weeks. It teaches us that while the outside may change, the same person is still inside."
4,The book that helps you find the true you.,"This book helps you find the true you, and leads you towards accepting it. The book has a girl going through what most teenagers now go through: insecurities, shallowness, lonliness, etc. The book can give you a good picture of how materialistic and selfish people in this world can be, and it will give you a motive to change it. I think when you're done reading it, you'll take a good look at yourself and what your life is about. The main concept is accepting you for who you are, and most girls need help doing so."
4,Size shouldn't be an Issue,"Lara Ardeche has what every teenage girl dreams of-popular friends, a great boyfriend, homecoming queen, and beauty pageant winner. Everything is going her way-until she starts to gain weight, and keeps gaining. After a few months Lara is more than 200 pounds. Follow Lara's story as she faces life as a fat teenage girl, being pressured by friends and family to get her great figure back. Now Lara will find out who her true friends really are and the ""in-crowd"" starts to completely shut her out. I really enjoyed this book because the story is so real. The characters are everyday people and it really explains what high school and are society is like. People are so unaccepting to others with weight problems. I would reccommend this book mostly to teenage girls but it would be good for anyone to read. This book really made me think about how I treat people who are more overweight than me or have other problems."
1,Fat Lane Shmat Lane,This book is shalow and the author must think that all girls that read it are terribly focused on their looks. The story is way too predictable and tthe characters are unrealistic. the character get themselves into situations that would never happen in real life and then deal with the situation in a dumb way. The authour will describe a character as intelligent and insightfull and then have them in a bathroom having a stupid conversation and saying how fat they look. This is an awful book and I would not recomend reading it.
3,life in the fat lane,Lara is a skinny popular girl. She was a beauty pageant winner and homecoming queen. She had the perfect boyfriend and the perfect parents. She is friends with people from a lot of different groups but mainly the popular group. She has a friend named molly who was different from everyone else. The popular girls knew her as the mouth. Everything is just perfect for her until she starts getting fat. She tired everything to lose weight like not eating and working out tell she felt sick. She loses all of her friends besides Molly and worst of all she is having relationship problems with her boyfriend Jett. I thought that this was a pretty good book and i am glad i read it.
4,"Shows the life of a tormented, yet typical teenager","I just finished reading this novel, and it was excellent. Ms. Bennett shows good judgement of teenagers today and what is importent to them, us. Not just being thin is important, but good grades, good friends and a good home. She effects all of these concerned areas! It's a great book, and I recommend it to all!"
2,A bad book for young kids,"I read this book and thought ""They swear TOO much!""This book uses words that are not appropriate towards young kids. Many 10 to 14 (pre-teens) will read this book. They will learn words and probably use it.This book is MEANINGLESS. A popular girl bacomes fat. that's the ONLY main thing that happenes.I don't think this is a good book. It just ISN't a book kids would want to read."
5,Violence free and safe for my fraidy cats little eyes,"This is a mildly spooky tape of that sweet, helpful little ghost we all know and love. It was my 3 year olds first introduction to Halloween on screen. I am so happy I picked this. He is a little fraidy cat who did not get past the first fifteen minutes of Monsters Inc but was able to watch this entire video. This is not one of those 30 minute tapes. It is over 90 minutes long. The first cartoon is all about halloween and trick or treating the last is about a vampire. All are fun and precious! I just wish they had this on DVD"
2,Limited memory for voice recognition,I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it for the voice recognition feature and software. I find it will only handle voice recognition in HQ mode which only gives 33 minutes of recording time. Nowhere does it tell me this in any of the promotional material or on the package. I had to use it to find this out and finally found a mention of this limitation deep in the software manual. 33 minutes isn't nearly enough recording time. I returned it for a refund.
4,Pretty good digital recorder,"True, you have to use the HQ (33 minute) mode for VR, but Standard Play (65 minutes) is great for most of my purposes. I used the RR-US351 to record my Dad's stories shortly before he passed away, then transfered to PC & shared with his grandchildren. Later, I used it with the self-timer mode to help identify a Nile monitor lizard that was terrifying a neighbor.Note that the included software converts only to bulky WAV, so if you want any kind of compression you'll some other audio processing software. LP mode (210 minutes) does not compress well."
4,"Very comprehensive, but poorly organized","The book is very thorough, it has an incredible number of drinks and even covers some about wine. Unfortunately, it's organized alphabetically, rather than by liquor. If you know the name of the drink you want, it's easy to find, but if you want to know what you can make with rum, you have to search."
1,Reprint of 1965 Book!!!,"Note that this ""2007"" geography is in fact an unrevised reprint of a 1965 book. Shame on Amazon for not giving the original publication date! Author was born in 1897...."
5,Sensual music,"Ragas build on a simple element for an extended period of time. The first here is forty-five minutes, but it is brilliant throughout. A good introduction to Indian music."
2,"Another Coffee-Table Effort from ""Real World"" Label","One can hardly blame Krishnamurty Sridhar for recording with his own brother. However, I wonder if this recording would have taken place if Shivakumar weren't his brother, but just some violinist off the street? Sridhar studied with ZM Dagar and so was no doubt raised on the fantastic jugalbandi of Nasirs Moinuddin/Aminuddin and Zahiruddin/Faiyazuddin. It's a good thing there are audio samples for this album, because you can decide for yourself if Shringar offers the kind of ragadari one can expect/demand/hope for from a musician of Sridhar's pedigree, or not ..."
1,Cracked at the first usage,"My husband and I received this coffeepot as a wedding gift (we placed almost the whole Twist Alea Limone collection in our registry). While we received this gift last year, we had not used it, saving it for a special occasion. A couple of days ago, I decided to use the coffeepot for the very first time. As I poured freshly brewed coffee inside the coffeepot, it cracked from the inside out. Considering the coffeepot was previously at room temperature and it's currently quite hot where we live, there is no possibility of a temperature shock leading to a potential crack in china. My husband and I were very disappointed with this, as we were expecting the Villeroy Boch china to be of high quality, and a coffeepot should be made so as to resist hot/warm temperatures. While the rest of our Twist Alea Limone collection has not displayed similar characteristic (we've used the plates and serving dishes on two occasions now), I do not recommend this coffeepot."
3,"The romantic stuff works, the rest does not","I love Anne Perry's Monk and Pitt and even WWI series, and I'm willing for the sake of interesting characters and setting and a sort of deconstructionist stiff-upper-lip ethic to accept the improbable coincidence of her plotting. But this novel pushes coincidence and authorial contrivance beyond acceptable. I can't think how to offer specifics without being a spoiler, but to newbies just wading into Anne Perry, leave this one for last."
4,BODY IN THE WHEELBARROW!! unab 10 cds,"A new Pitt & Charlotte book is always a cause for celebration, and this one is no exception.Pitt finds himself faced with a murder case that could have major national and international repercussionsA seemingly open-and shut-case occurs. Apparently, an Egyptian woman Ayesha Zakari shot her lover in her back yard and then put him in a wheelbarrow in order to get rid of it.The police arrive quickly after a tip off, finding the body in the wheelbarrow. The gun that shot him belongs to Ayesha. But it becomes increasingly clear to Pitt that Ayesha, supposed mistress of a member of the Cabinet, is not the perpetrator of the crime, after all.Pitt finds himself faced with a murder case that could have major national and international repercussions, while Charlotte and her maid, the intrepid Gracie, look into the disappearance of Gracie's friend's brother, a valet. Gracie is a wonderful character, and her relationship with Inspector Tellman takes a step forward."
3,A competent Victorian mystery with an Egyptian twist,"Anne Perry, the author of two series of murder mysteries involving different detectives, knows how to convey the atmosphere of Victorian London. In this case, investigator Thomas Pitt's murder investigation reaches beyond England to colonial Egypt, intriguingly described. Most of the story moves at a moderate pace that adds to its believability, though action junkies may be disappointed. The servants' very different use of the English language may illustrate the sharp social class divisions of Victorian England, but their statements are not easy to read."
2,Not very entertaining,"Not exactly sure why so many people gave this book such excellent reviews, I can only guess they are big fans of Anne Perry. I was simply bored. It is not much fun reading about an investigation that is simply going nowhere for hundreds of pages (admittedly, I listened to an unabridged audiobook - no complaints about the narration quality, btw, but it was one of the longest audiobooks I've ever listened to). Yes, it is somewhat interesting to learn about the peculiarities of the Anglo-Egyptian relations of the period, etc., but really, if the book was 5 times as short, it would be entertaining, but certainly not in its present form."
2,Last Anne Perry novel for me,"I must agree with one of the other 2-star reviewers. I don't know why so many people love her novels. I do like the characters, and the period. But there's no action to speak of, no real peril, and the endings are just horrible! It might just be a preference of mine, but I think I will be moving on to other authors."
2,Glad it was free,"This was terrible. I can do without the blood and gore that was required to fill pages. The book fell short on character development. I don't think I'll read another by this author. I love suspense, but this missed the target. Sure glad I didn't pay out hard cash for this one!"
5,The Real Thing,"This is a genuinely gripping, deeply creepy first novel with many great scares. The characters are not only well-wrought as individuals, each is also expertly woven into the fractured, disenfranchised society of Bedford, making the town itself feel like a living, breathing thing, a thing that can be hunted, tortured and killed. Langan's Susan Marley, a tortured soul turned sadist, makes for a great monster in the vein of Carrie and Ringu's Sadako. There's an influence of the masters in the prose, Straub, King and Shirley Jackson, but also something wonderfully, horribly new. So, read it already!"
4,Good Solid Horror,"I think a 3.5 stars is probably more accurate than 4 stars but i gave it 4 anyway because it was better than 3 so why not round up? For a first try, this book was done very well. The story is solid, the flow is natural, the dialogue rings true, the symbolism is somewhat heavy handed but such things are easily forgiven in an overall very well written and entertaining read. More than anything, this book positively drips atmosphere. It deals with some touchy subjects but manages not to do so a gratuitous way. Its a good old fashioned ghost story about a damaged and rejected woman who finds redemption and forgiveness in being loved by just one person. I recommend it for anyone whose taste tends to run to King and Straub."
4,Quite Good,"Sarah Langan handles multiple plot threads and multiple characters with aplomb. The Keeper is the story of a woman who becomes kind of the spiritual repository for a town's dark secrets, its people's disappointments and their private and public anguish. And a warning seems appropriate here: what is revealed about this woman's childhood is extremely disturbing."
3,Oh horrors! Another horror book!,"I found the book to be written rather well even though I don't really like this genre of book. I got it because it was free and it sounded more thrilling than horror. The beginning made we want to continue but the farther I got into the book the less interested I became. I didn't like any of the characters really. I couldn't sympathize with them but then, maybe that's the way the book is supposed to do. Everyone of them had issues: maybe due to the town itself. I'm glad I finished it and was satisfied with the ending but wish there had been some epilogue to sum up the whole story."
3,"Good, for a first novel","OK. It did hold my attention until the end, but a bit of a disappointment was the end. Ms.Langan wrote a good first horror novel, but with a bit more practice maybe she'll do better. C'mon guys, please stop comparing her to King, Straub, and-GULP- Dan Simmons! No way. She really has her work cut out for her to catch up to these masters. If your looking for a book to pass the time on the subway or plane, read it. If your looking for a great piece of horror fiction, try ""Song of Kali"" by Dan Simmons or ""Midnight Sun"" by Ramsey Campbell. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,I liked it~,"This was the first Sara Langan book I have read, and I enjoyed it. Good characters, good suspense, and kinda scary. I was dissapointed with the way the book ended, I definetly wanted to know WHAT HAPPENED!!! I would reccommend this book."
1,"Disappointing journey into sex, sex, and more sex.","I enjoy a good horror book as much as the next guy... but I was severely disappointed by Langan's attempt to build a plot from nothing more than gore and crude sexual depictions. We used to be treated to truly terrifying thrillers that played with the mind - an effort like this which merely sinks to the lowest common denominator leaves me wishing I could get a refund on time invested.In short: writing style promising while not fully polished, but in the end the material was disgusting and disappointing."
2,The Keeperby Sarah Langdon,This is a book not worth reading. I struggled through the last chapters.K. Cullen
3,Disappointing read,Mediocre genre read at best. Not as good as previous reviews has led me to believe. Will probably not be reading her other novels.
4,I like Sarah Langan's Writing,"This is my second Langan book -- the first was Audrey's Door -- and I find that there is something about her writing that I legitimately like. When I've read other reviews, it seems like other readers don't like her as much as I do. Hmmmm. I believe that what I enjoy is how much she seems to care about the deep sorrow at the heart of her characters -- the loneliness.I do feel like the last third or so, maybe a bit more of the book, that the author lost her footing and that the story became too brood and too prolonged, but it remained a book I enjoyed."
2,Horrible Book,"This is a horrible book. Not that it is badly written. The story is obviously a horror story, but one that is too close to home to the true horror of what many people experience. I firmly believe in no uncertain terms should anyone with any history of abuse, be it child abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or physical abuse should read this book. The characters are true real, the injuries and pain too plausible. This is art laying bear the reality of the pain and despair that can reside within human lives through hyperbole certainly, but it is still very real. Having counseled people so injured, I would be concerned that the story, which grabs you, would open many wounds and even forestall healing that is already taking place. It is a horrible book because it reflects what is in all to many cases a true horrible existence for some human beings."
2,"Great beginning, poor ending","I enjoyed the beginning of the book and thought to myself: this will be interesting, but everything got just too boring, to the point that I gave up on it after reading at least 75% of the book I just could not finish it."
4,What a creepy little town!,"I really enjoyed this book despite a couple of problems. There were quite a few characters and I had a hard time keeping track of them, plus I would have loved an epilogue. Still, Sarah Langan really knows how to write a creepy ghost story. I am looking forward to reading more from her."
2,Waste of time,This book rambles and basically is a total waste of your time to read. I almost didn't finish it. It took forever for the story to get going and even once it did I didn't feel like it ever got where it was supposed to go!
3,Didn't quite win me over,"I have to say at the outset that I am not a big fan of this genre. For instance,I don't think Stephen King is a bad writer, but I really disliked ""The Stand"". I pickedup this book because I decided to give the genre another shot after reading avery positive review in the NYT. Overall, I found the book disappointing. It iscertainly well written, and I don't think it relies on cliches too much. However,I could never quite see the point of it: I couldn't really identify with any of thecharacters, it was never really frightening, and I never found anything that was reallyworthwile remembering from it. I am currently reading the Gormenghast novels,and it certainly cannot compare."
2,"Starts strong, becomes too long and boring","This book started out with enough mystery about Susan Marley I was hooked. She wanders around town with no explanation as to what is really wrong with her. However, as this book goes on the mystery starts getting a little old. I was ready for this book to be over long before the end came. I was disappointed in this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. And the closer the end got the more confusing the book seemed to get for me. I had trouble following it and what character was actually talking. I didn't realize from reading the back of the book, this was a story about a town destroyed by a paper mill and the ghosts were coming back. I don't recommend this book; it felt more like a waste of my time."
1,Terrible Writing !!,"This book jumped from here to there, character here and there with no explanation of why it changed. First it talked about a person or a conversation - then jumped to another person out of the blue. And none of it was even interesting. Boring..I could not finish. This lady is no author in my opinion. Just a bunch of rambling on...this is probably the worst book I have read and I am a huge reader with so many books I had to get a kindle. It will be deleted off my kindle to make room for something else. Waste of money."
1,Waste of time ...,"Okay, I have really been trying to find something remotely interesting about this book .... its just not happening. I found myself skipping pages looking for something meaningful to happen. I am giving up today, can't even finish the book! Guess it was worth the price I paid for it ... nothing!"
1,Boring,"First, Amazon amazes me. I read this book and came here to read the reviews. Amazon informed me that I had already purchased the book. I looked up the invoice and found to my relief that I had paid nothing. It was a freebee. It would have been more horrifying to me than the novel to have discovered that I had paid money for it.Now to the book. A common word you will find in many of the reviews is ""boring"". That pretty well sums up the experience of the read to me. The characters are not well developed, there are too many of them, the plot is weak, the largest part of the book is a boring description of the fantastic implosion of the town. Three parts to this book: beginning (so so but not really engaging), middle (the boring destruction), end (less than the so so beginning, but with the end of the book happily approaching).I agree with the boring description, as well as another that seems common, ""waste of time""."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"Besides being a disgusting tale of a father raping his own daughter, the book is stupid and boring. Even free it is overpriced."
4,a bit depressing but still a good read,"I had heard good things about Sarah Langan, so I was glad to finally read her novel. Overall, I found out it to be pretty creepy with some good horror elements. It's definitely worth checking out. The writing was high quality and story was well plotted. I found it a little hard to get behind some of the characters and the ending of the novel was a bit depressing. All in all, a good read. Give it a try.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,Never really takes off,"I enjoyed The Missing, but couldn't get into Audrey's Door; so I gave this writer a third try with The Keeper, to break the tie. While I enjoy Ms. Langan's style, The Keeper just didn't go anywhere that gave me a sense of foreboding or a taste of fear. I kept reading, hoping the tension would mount and climax at some point, but, I don't know, it just never came to fruition. It's going to take a lot of hardy recommendations to pick up another of this author's books. I've been reading horror for like forty years, so perhaps I'm jaded, or just hard to please at this point. Four stars for the good writing, minus two for the premise."
1,Just couldn't do it...,"I tried, really, but I just couldn't finish it. Too many characters with too little substance. Herky jerky jumps from one character then back again. It just didn't tie together well. It was like watching a bad TV program that you hope will get better but just doesn't. You know where the plot is going but getting there just isn't worth the time. After reading 68% of the book I said, ""That's all folks""."
2,SLow and boring,I am glad that I managed to get this book for free because I would have felt cheated otherwise. It took me a long time to finish the book because of how boring it was.It is funny to read through the reviews and notice that there are some that loved the book and some that hated it. I am one of the later.If it was still free I would say to go ahead and attempt to read it... but they are asking $6.99 for it now so I say save your money and read something else.
1,Meanders,I picked up this novel after it was mentioned in a New York Times article called Shelley's Daughters. Mostly I found the story just meanders. I think the combination of the constant shift of viewpoint and the unexciting writing makes the novel feels diffuse and bland. The climax doesn't feel like a climax. And there is nothing else to keep one's interest; neither character or writing. Woudn't recommend to anyone.
4,Apples of Gold Teachings,Excellent Christian teaching of Titus 2: 3-5 scripture. We are previewing in hopes of starting this ministry in our church. Seems to be a perfect fit.
1,horrible....,i got this item. 3 out 5 speakers did not work.. and coby would just not care and let amazon refund it... not even a day and this thing wouldn't work... dont buy it.. defective.
2,crap,"These speakers were received as a gift and worked amazing for the first 2 hours, speakers were beautiful, and the dvd player did its job, until the actual dvd player/receiver refused to work at all, lost dvd inside, was forced to unscrew the whole thing. The speakers however are worth it if you already have a receiver and are looking for a decent set of speakers or if you want to try your luck with the dvd player, otherwise go somewhere else for a full system set"
1,No show,Its hard for me to write a review for an item I never received. I ordered this over a month ago and never got it. I'm still waiting on my refund of $95.88. I have ordered several items from this site and have always been satisfied until now. I had to rate the item in order to submit this review but please disregard the gold star.
2,"""Welcome to Hell - here's your accordian""","Okay, so I know its a harmonium, but jeez is that instrument tough on the ears. Nusrat's vocals are powerful and inspiring, the tabla sets a nice beat, but the harmonium ruins the show. A little harmonium, OK, but not the WHOLE CD. What you get is Nusrat drowned out by the extremely annoying off-beat, wailing, choppy drone of that awful harmonium. If it wasn't for the passion that Nusrat brings to the recording, this cd would be no better than one star. If it wasn't for the grating harmonium, ""Shabaaz"" would be a four star effort. For Nusrat's inspiring vocals with a more soothing backdrop, try ""The Prayer Cycle"". Or buy ""Shabaaz"" and groove to the agitating vibration of the harmonium."
5,I am cooperative--English and Spanish!,"Part of a series that looks at behaviors such as honesty, patience, and responsibility. Follows the daily activities of a young girl who is helpful at home and school. She also works well with others in small groups. Each left page shows a colorful and good quality photo. Each right page has one or two sentences that explains being cooperative. The English is above the Spanish. For example, ""I work with others on a team. Trabajo con los dem√°s en equipo."" Ends with the sentiment, ""I am cooperative. I do my part."" There is a glossary and an index. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Librarian"
5,A great gift,This book was a great gift for my father. How was struggling to read his old bible. The large print made it easy for him to read along in church and at home.
3,I can rap....,"...like Paul Wall too:I'm wise like old age,I brush teeth like Colgate,I sit down like a chair,I look good like combed hair,I got money like a piggy bank,I'm full like a big gas tank.Simple lines like these are killing me! I like Paul Wall's flow and his beats, but GOD he has to step up his lyrical game. Give me something more than a metaphor man."
5,Excellent insight to dealing with mental disorders,"As a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints dealing with depression my struggle has been hard at times. After reading this book I recommended it to all of my family. Many times they have told me that they don't understand why I feel the way I do or what is going on in my head. At times I thought the author was speaking about me specifically. I also like reading a book that had an LDS perspective. It was reassuring to hear that because I haven't been ""healed"" of my illness does not necessarily mean that I have too little faith."
3,LDS and mentally ill,"I thought this book was helpful for those on my caretaker team. It gave them an LDS perspective of what is going on in my mind. I would recommend it for those who are working with mentally ill people- Bishops, family, and friends. Not very informative for the individual with the illness."
5,Wonderful resource,"This book is a wonderful resource for Latter-Day Saints (or any person for that matter) attempting to understand mental illness and/or suffering and why they are part of the Earthly existence. Morrison sets forth a broad picture of common mental illnesses and weaves in real life stories, including very personal experiences from his own family. I highly recommend this book."
3,Valley of Sorrow,"Good information. A little simplistic at times. Doesn't give basic resources or what is avaliable, actually questions to ask when seeking help."
4,Enjoyed the read,"This is the first book I've read by Suzanne Enoch and it's definitely worth reading. The romance isn't as well developed as I had expected; Saint lusts after her for at least 3/4 of the book but never really falls in love with her. However, the kidnapping/imprisonment of Saint by Evie and the orphans is hilarious and more than makes up for any shortcoming in the plot or the characters."
5,Suzanne's stories,"I went about this the wrong way and read the third book first. When I realized there had to be two more 'out there', I ordered them from Amazon. It wasn't really necessary to read the other two books to understand each one. The author added just enough story to understand what had happened to the other two couples, which made me want to read each one. Great detail. Great author."
3,...,"Am I the only one who sees that Evie was not weak and that Saint was the problem in the book?Evie was not weak. She'd always been misused and treated like a thing instead of a woman, that she was used to being a doormat. I hated Saint for the majority of the book. The way he talked to her was taunting, not seductive. He teased and manipulated her, he deserved being locked in that basement. I kept waiting for his comeuppance, or at least a scene where he realizes what an ass he was, but no-go.I HATE when a marriage proposal or a love confession scene is the very last thing in the book. It leaves room for doubt that everything went okay. And, here we readers are, waiting through the whole story for him to start actually being nice, and for them to finally be together, and we get only two pages of it? And at the very end? Hopefully the last of this series is better."
3,Stretches believability but fun to read,"3.5/5.0Ms Enoch's ability to grab the reader from the first page and sink them into the story until nothing matters but finding out what is going to happen next makes this book lots of fun to read. It's the believability factor that keeps it from rating much higher. Some of the situations [the ""kidnapping"" as a perfect example], however funny, were a little over the top, even the sexual aspect didn't quite make muster in this area."
3,"Decently-written, surprisingly fun for such stock characters","Ah, the rake and the headstrong virgin! This is a pairing that has occurred innumerable times in romance novels, and, while this story doesn't really add any fresh new insights on those archetypal characters, it does turn it into a reasonably fun and engaging read. The writing is of a fairly professional caliber that is serviceable and not tacky, but is not quite as elegant or charming as that of Lisa Kleypas or Julia Quinn. In contrast to my favorite novels, where the energy of the narrative is carried by the charisma of the characters, this novel only really has its plot to recommend itself. It is a fun plot, with a satisfying conclusion, but I do wish the characters were not so bland and cliche."
3,Pretty average,"Just OK. Finished well, but I had a hard time believing much of this story. I liked that the H/h were an unlikely couple, but how they kept crossing paths pushed my limits of believability. Also, the heroine kept saying she wanted to protect her (and her families) reputation and respectability, but her actions constantly said otherwise. The audiobook voice was also hard to listen to, so I'd recommend reading it before listening to it."
1,She DID NOT deserve the hero!,"I stuck with this book hoping the ""heroine"" would grow a spine by the end of the book but was disgusted to find her lily-livered to the very end. It was bad enough that Evelyn wouldn't stand up to her hideous brother about the work she valued with her orphans but she wouldn't even stand up to him over the man she loved. She was actually going to marry someone she despised (after her heartless brother sold her to him) even after St. Aubyn offered to take her away. No, poor Saint first had to get her worthless brother a job before she would marry him. Any worthy heroine would have told her family to go hang after the way they treated Evelyn and walked right out the front door.St. Aubyn was the only reason I finished the book and then I was sorry I did because he was then stuck with that awful spineless woman. The delicious Scoundrel deserved much better than her."
1,A real scoundrel all right,"I have seldom seen a more vulgar or ungentlemanly 'hero'. He is so uncouth that his supposed reform is completely unbelieveable. There is no real romance or sensuality-the only two love scenes in the book are depressingly brief and belittling. He treats her like a whore, and anyone who has stand-up sex in the theatre toilet alcove is just begging to be ruined. The fact that she isn't is a minor miracle, as is the fact that someone with an pretensions to intelligence at all, as the heroine has, should have steered clear a million miles from such a debauched man. His decision to marry her is downright insulting and the ending trite, clich√©, and completely unbelievable as well. This novel makes light of adultery, orphans and a whole host of social ills in an attempt to bre witty and amusing, and it falls flat because the 'hero' is so callus and her own family are also odious. I was hard put to like a single character."
5,Great Characters! Great Story!!!,"This is Suzanne Enoch's best book to date!!! Saint is a complex and irrisistable character and Enoch lets us into his mind long enough to know that this Rake and Rogue has a heart too.Warning: Once you start reading this book you will not be able to stop, so plan on staying at home and enjoy......"
4,Good series,Loved the story and how all unfolds. Suzanne Enoch writes a good one and thoroughly enjoyed it. Will keep reading her books
1,"stupid, offensive","It's hard to describe how stupid and offensive this book is.The heroine keeps saying that she wants to prove to her family and friends that she's smart and capable, then she acts like an idiot.The hero is offensive. He's the kind of person who, in a different era, would be groping women on the subway.I kept reading, hoping it would improve, but stopped and returned it when just got intolerable."
3,Chantilly by Dana,"Love this perfume, but not please that supplier changed the size & therefore, the price. Originally I thought I was order a smaller bottle at $20. actually received a larger bottle for $34 - Good thing this is my fragrance of choice. but I don't like surprises when they cost more."
5,Wonderful Perfume,"This is a wonderful everyday perfume, I have been using it for years. It came in its original package and in a very timely fashion. Thank you."
5,love the large size,have been using this product for over 30 yrs it is one of my favorites the scent is so soft even my granchildren love the scent keep this large size on line as it cannot been found in stores
4,Unknown and Underappreciated,"Prism's debut album slipped quietly out of Canada in the late 1970's, and before long ""Spaceship Superstar"" and ""Take Me to the Kaptin"" began popping up intermittedly on FM radio (ah, those were the days!). Great vocals, good blend of guitar, synths and brass, with an interesting mix of styles. ""Julie"" is the hit single that should have been. It is a much more consistant work than Prism's later releases. If these songs had the benefit of today's production technology, it would easily rate five stars. As it is, it is a solid four."
1,A collection of pointless unrelated short stories,"This is not a novel but a collection of pointless, unrelated short stories. Good Will Hunting it ain't. To find out about physicists read Feyman's autobiographies or Radiance."
2,One of Lightman's lesser works,"If you have read ""Reunion"" or ""Einstein's Dreams"", you'll be quite upset with this novel.It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works. He has developed as a writer since this book, however. Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels."
3,A for effort,"A twelve year-old could have written better than this, however I admire Ms. Lord's devil-may-care attitude and perseverance. While the story is dry, and written with the speed of an attention-deficit child, throughout she proves herself to be a determined, unapologetic woman, and one whose childhood is unfortunately all-too common. While a victim of circumstance, she does not let in to self-pity.A motivational feel-good book? No. A surprising, ground-breaking tell-all? No. More like a typical case study of what happens to many victims of sexual abuse, poverty and neglect, wrapped up as a quick beach read."
3,"Not bad, but not 'tell all' kind of book. Shows porn industry for what it is, lowlifesville","I still don't think Traci (er, ah, sorry;Norma Kusma) is doing THAT well based onthe sorry films I've seen her in. And whydon't she and her husband have any kids?!Didn't go far enough here and there butexposes filth like Ron Jeremy and otherkhazar sleazeballs for what they are.Right on Traci! And how many of us knewshe chose the name 'Lords' after ourHawai'i Five-0 Chief, Jack Lord, asin Steve McGarrett?"
3,Hollywood being the obstacle,"I saw Traci Lords on Oprah and was amazed that she was an ex-porn star. She was so articulate, pretty and smart. That made me read the book,to know how she got involved and how she got out. Her story was very moving and my heart went out to her. Unfortunately the last third of the book gives tedious information how to make it as an actress in Hollywood,which was too extensive and too generic.I wanted to know what happened to her mother & sisters she used to be so close with and in the last 2 pages it got quickly all wrapped up. Therefore I was a little disappointed, because the details that made it her particular story were missing in the end and that really would have been ""underneath it all"" for me."
5,A Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was an open and honest look into Traci's life as told by her. Thiere are a few points in this book where her writing is not the best but I did not buy it just for the skilled writing, I get a kick out of people who bash autobiographies regarding exact grammer and lack of a well told story, after all it is real life and real life is messy.If you have any interest in Traci, or the porn subject I recomend reading this book."
2,"""POOR LITTLE ME!""","If you want to read about Traci's experiences in the porn business, this book is not for you. She claims that she doesn't remember a single thing from those days because she was taking so much drugs and alcohol to mask her pain and indignity. If you read what her contemporaries have to say about her claims (Ron Jeremy, for one), I think you'll find yourself more inclined to believe them instead of her. The true surprise, however, is that Traci Lords is smart as a whip. She is insightful, astute and appears to be a keen judge of character. Of course the reader wants to believe what she's written here because she does come across as lovable and sweet, but somewhere within the pages of her book, I smelled a rat."
2,Fact or fiction?,"I always thought Traci Lords was an over-acting, under-talented actress (except for her natural endowment), in or out of porn. One thing she does possess is a lot of ambition and the will to overcome obstacles. Her autobiography details her life into the adult entertainment industry and out of it. There's surprisingly very little about her years in the porn world and the 100 hardcore films she starred in as an underaged vixen. There's also no mention of her family's Jewish background. (She does mention that her great-grandmother on her mother's side was Irish, and her paternal grandfather came from the Ukraine.) Each chapter is rather short, and the book reads like a diary with carefully picked entries. There's a bit too much self-analysis. Even the pictures, some in color, are a letdown.The question is, of course, how much of what Lords writes is fact and how much is fiction. But maybe that's just a silly question. Like her films, Traci Lords's book is not to be taken seriously."
5,I LOVE TRACI MORE AFTER READING THAT BOOK,If you are a fan of Traci Lords please get that book nowIt rocks!!!!You are going to love itYou are going to admire herWritten easy and simply to be read from anyoneAAAAA++++++
2,Yet another attempt to cash in on the last moment of fame,"This is typical, one moment she said there were no drugs. Now! there were drugs and booze. This lady is trying to cash in on her last moments of fame, well she knew what she was doing. Giving the readers a sob story with sexually explicit pictures, if she was so sincere she should have left out the pictures and got to the point such as what is wrong with the industry. Obviously she doesn't know enough about the industry since she was so doped up.Drugs and parties, anyone can figure out what will happen.A book I rather recommend is ""Cut Throat Business, I am having the last word"", a book written by a woman, film editor. She worked in the industry and she will tell the reader what really goes on and it is not 10 years ago that the story is referred to, this true story is fresh a revolves around the year of 2000-2002. Save your money on Traci Lords sob story and read a real story like Cut Throat Business, which it is."
1,Don't Blame Me,"It seems so funny that everything bad in her life was alwayssomebody else's fault. She takes responsibility for nothingshe's done. There are alot of us out there who were molested and raped as children and didn't turn into pornstars at 15. Ihave a hard time seeing her as the victim she's so desperatelytrying to play. Don't bother reading this book unless you wantto read 281 pages of ""Poor Me"". She should read Jenna Jamesonsbook to see how one takes responsibility for ones actions without blaming everyone but the woman in the mirror."
5,Mind Bending,"I was a Traci Lords fan in the 80s. Though she seems to have some regrets about her past, I can't help but get the feeling that she would do it all over again under the same conditions. I will always be a fan, but I'm happy to see that she has proven to be a talented actress in spite of whatever misgivings she has had about her past."
2,An ok book about an unappreciative tart,"The book itself is half boring and half good. Her time spent in porn was fun to read about, but all the acting stories afterward were kind of dull. I did not like her lousy attitude towards the porn industry. She lied about her age to get into the business, and her time in the business ended up getting her way more fame than she deserves. Would people really give a crap about her movies and music were it not for her porn star background? I would imagine not.If you are one of those people that love her non-porn work, then by all means read this book. People looking for a lot of juicy stories about the world of porn would be better off buying books by Jenna Jameson or Christy Canyon."
3,Its okay,"Her writing is so so,but the story is somewhat interesting and a bit sad.I'm glad that she was able to become successful."
2,Ok,"Really simply written. After reading it, I wondered why I had wanted to read it in the first place. I should not read autobiographies written by people under 40. Just not enough life lived to make it interesting."
5,Great writing,I know I'm not really supposed to write a review of a book of 292 pages when I am only on the page 34. But this book is so vividly written I just couldn't wait. Some people have the gift of writing and Traci truly has it. Her voice as the author is original and enticing. She comes across as a perceptive and caring human being. You are taken right back into the moments she's describing. I would recommend this book to everyone. You can't be disappointed with this book! I love biographies and this one has the candidness some of the autobiographies have failed to convey.
5,You won't look at her the same way again.,"Yes, I was a fan of her during my teenage years. I followed her career even after the porn years. I even love her techno cd. If you're looking for juicy information on the porno business, you should look elsewhere. This book is about how a young innocent girl was neglected by her parents, brought into drugs and pornography, woke up, turned her life around, and became a success in everything she touched. Her story provides hope and will change the way you look at Traci Lords again. Great Book!!"
4,Traci tells her story,"Traci Lords has finally come out with the definitive story of her life, at least I think she does. Traci has always been the center of controversy. She has allegedly told differing stories on the story of her life.This book seems honest, sometimes brutally honest and Traci pulls no punches (even throwing some at herself), which is why I do believe this book to be an accurate tale of her life.The book is pretty thorough and Traci does not rely on just her X-rated past to sell her story. It is very much the tale of a survivor and a winner."
5,Favorite love story ever!,"There is no story it's equal. When I think of a man truly loving a woman, this book comes to mind. It's the most deeply intimate telling of one man's heart, mind and soul. Is it possible love like this exist between a man or a woman for the other? This story is to be cherished for its lofty ideology. I view the Harvesters love for the woman as saints have loved God...deeply beyond what most of us can grasps with our worldliness. I might buy this book for my teenage nieces--they should read this story. Why? I wonder if they could, in their wildest fantasies, imagine a young man loving them similarily. Perhaps they may be more choosy in whom they date."
2,Not so good.,"Not very interesting. Even the publishing format left something to be desired. I was surprised, especailly after how good The Keeper of the Bees by the same author was."
5,I consider this a must read.,"I love classic novels and I would put this in that genre. Having read a few but not all of Mrs Porters works, I consider this story my favorite. It is the one I have read more than one time. I love the hero and the fable like way that he finds the love of his life. Is it realistic? no. But neither is Cinderella. It is just a lovely little country tale, about believing in dreams and the power of a simple life. It is one of the best love stories."
2,not that good,"Do people really like this movie? There is not one single scare in the entire thing, the plot makes little to no sense (especially the ending, in which a character previously declared dead shows up, alive and well, with no explanation of any kind), and the kid brother is abandoned by his big brother so many times and against all reason that I felt I might go mad if I had to suffer one more such scene. I kind of feel the same way about all these five-star reviews people are posting here. Come on, people; develop some taste."
2,Interesting but not scary,"Plot: A kid on a bike, his brother and a funeral home. Then a tall man whos turnin people into some kind of demons or slaves. It had somewhat of an atmosphere to it but this wasnt that great. I mean it was boring, long, and the ending made no sense at all. Low budget dosent have to mean bad but this one was close to it. It kept me watchin till the end hoping something good would happen but it ultimately disapointed. They 'overdid' the music. I was watchin the scenes and it was that continuous loud score playing over and over. I guess it was for the 70s but far from the best horror movie."
2,Very Dated; Very Boring,"I'm a horror movie fan, and I can certainly appreciate horror movies of the late 70's/early 80's. Halloween, for example, is brilliant. The Exorcist, in my opinion, will dominate its genre eternally. Phantasm, however, falls flat nearly every way it turns. This movie is uneventful, riddled with bad acting, and accompanied by a very dated, cheesy soundtrack. I kept waiting for the big ""ah hah"" moment...the moment where I could walk away feeling good about how I just spent the last 88 minutes of my life. That moment never came. I've read reviews the label Angus Scrimm's portrayal of ""the Tall Man"" as wonderful. I don't get it. What was so great about a lanky old guy who walks funny? I give it two stars only because the scene with the silver ball is halfway decent. Otherwise, I'd only give it one. Save your time and money with this one...it's a waste of both."
2,Phantasm,"Jeezus!This movie is boring and the kid is annoying and the tall man is not scary. So, now you know..."
4,Good,"It was good over all, a little slow to start but when it picked up it was a good movie. It does set the stage for a really good second part."
5,One of the most original and greatest horror movies ever made!,"It will soon be Halloween season again and time to watch some of my favorite horror movies. My big three are Salem's Lot (1979), Halloween (the original of course), and PHANTASM! The 1970s was the best decade for horror in my opinion and this one is no exception. I can't really compare it to any other classic because it exists in a world all its own. What other movie has The Tall Man, a deadly floating silver ball, and dwarves from another dimension!? My favorite scenes are the finger in the box, when the boy seeks advice from ""grandmother"" (was that Ozzy? lol), and when the silver ball first appears. Other than the nasty (rubber) fly the effects are quite good, and the movie at times exists in an eery haze. If you haven't seen it yet check it out and I hope you enjoy ...BOOOOOOOOOOOOY!"
5,Phantastic!,"Phantasm on Dvd is awesome!It contains a enormous amount of interesting extras on the dvd version.Including feature-length commentary by Don Coscarelli,a old interview with Don ans Angus Scrimm.A home-movie outtakes with Reggie Bannister and Don Coscarelli commenting.A great transfer also,the colors are much brighter too.All in all great fun.Booyyyyyyy!"
2,good ideas snuffed out by a weak story,"""Phantasm"" is a movie that has so much going for it you can't help but get disappointed when it starts going down the drain. It's a low-budget horror that came out of the 1970s 'renaissance' and boasted a combination of horror and science fiction (although neither aspect is particularly strong). However, the interesting ideas of the story (corpses being transformed into dwarves, the murderous silver sphere, the Tall Man, etc.) aren't fully realized, and the lapses in logic and common sense grow tedious long before the movie's over.Even a film that lacks coherent sense needs just the slightest foundation of plot to be enjoyed (i.e.--anything by Lucio Fulci), which is where ""Phantasm"" falls short. A noble effort--my review actually leans more toward 2.5 stars--but I can't recommend it.On the plus side, the musical score is effectively spooky, much like a John Carpenter/Alan Howarth collaboration crossed with Goblin."
2,...,"I really hated this movie. I guess it's because when I saw ""Phantasm"" in the late 80's when there was a lot more to horror movies than that. I thought the plot was a crock however, I did watch ""Phantasm 2"" when it came out, and in my opinion it was way better than the first one."
5,Phantasm(1979)*****BOYYYYY!,"Extremely good horror film. This movie has a very creepy plot to it. Its a story about a ""Tall man""(which is his characters name)who is an alien from another planet.What he does is he runs a funeral home which people think is a completly normal one. But they are wrong. Dead wrong.What they dont know is that after each fineral, the Tall man takes the dead corpses back into the funeral home and reanimates them (brings them back from the dead)and turns them into these midget like slaves on his home planet. When the young Mike finds out what is going on, he and his brother try to stop him, and finally do .............so they think....This movie has some awsome special effects as well."
4,Good movie but the sequel is better!,My review is the title. I'm using this space as a forum to petition my fellow Phantasmaniacs to urge Universal (or whatever controlling influence) to get Phantasm II on DVD. Who's with me?
3,A Must For Horror Fans~~Tall Man Awesome,One has to be a die hard horror fan to get into this movie...The acting is bad and the lines are poorly written but The Tall Man's presence makes up for all of this...He is naturally scary..The ending left fans wondering but I heard in later movies the loose ends will be tied..It does not sound like it but I am a die hard fan..This movie is certainly a cult classic...
5,I now know what they were talking about!!,"I absolutly loved this movie!! I love horror movies all the way and this one was no exception. I never even knew about the Phantasm series until I saw the DVD ""Boogeymen."" I saw the trailer and a scene from the movie and I wanted to know more. I went out and bought this DVD and it was the best investment of [money] I could ever make!! I watched it twice in one day it was so good! It is scary, gory, funny in some parts, and just plain chilling! The Tall Man is one of the scariest men to hit the horror screen! You should definatley see this movie if you love horror movies!!"
4,great 70's horror flick,"Almost up there with Texas chainsaw.If you are into b movie horror this is a good one to try out.Don't waste time with part 2 ,3,4,5,6,,7,8,99,100..."
2,It just wasn't scary,"Well, I bought this movie based on the numerous 4/5 stars given by other reviewers. Waited for quite some time till it got delivered and was expecting to see something outstanding (smth you cant put your hands on in the middle of Region 2...). But frankly I was disappointed. This movie is not scary at all. It has some interesting scenes (the tension is quite OK when inside the funeral house, liked the head drilling sphere, maybe the dwarfs) but not much else. The plot is easy, the caracters are somehow (maybe only for me) not really believable. The Tall Man is ""advertised"" as a dreadful, evil caracter. For me he's just a weird guy (I don't mean to offend any Phan, sorry). To be fair, I'll give it one more trial. There are movies you need to digest and at the second watch they may prove to be better.I'm now working hard convincing myself that Phantasm has it's place in my collection as a horror classic but this does not seem to help. Luckily it did not cost a fortune."
4,What the hell does Leonard Maltin know,"A cult classic! You definately have to be a Phan-fan, because I don't believe that many people that are just seeing it for the first time are going to see the true lure of Phantasm films. A slice of personal philosophy...do not take the word of a film critic who is paid to be one. I realized this when I saw Siskel and Ebert give Yentel two thumbs up, and Hellraiser 2 two thumbs down. Anyway, you know the old saying about opinions..."
4,Still one of my top horror flicks of all time!,"I saw the first Phantasm back in 1979. I was a little 6th grader with no clue what I was getting into. Back then the shows didn't check for I.D's. The movie freaked me out so that, that Saturday I was to have a sleep over at my girl friends. I ended up going home instead and ended up sleeping in my parents bedroom for two nights. And, anyway what where my P's thinking letting a 6th grader go to a horror movie. They just left me money and I went to see what ever I wanted. Maybe that is why at 36 nothing scares me anymore. I do own Phantasm 1. but not the others. Was not thrilled about the sequels, sorry. I still watch it every fall with friends from that era. We always have a good time, and I still get creped out.Great job on the original movie.Most Sincerely,Ms. Rebecca M. Pfarr"
4,Totally Disjointed But Enjoyable,"People have said to me that they can't make heads nor tails out of this odd flick, which a mixture of horror, comedy, and science fiction. The plot is simple enough: a kid enlists his friends to help him gather evidence on the town's local undertaker, who is the prime suspect in several mysterious murders and disappearances. The movie employs a lot of weird camera tricks and special effects, some done quite effectively on the low budget the producers had to work with. However, there are many eerie sequences that have left audiences confused as to what exactly was going on: is the kid dreaming this stuff or not? Don't take it too seriously! Enjoy this quirky gem."
4,Creeeeepy,"This book was very good, and I enjoyed it. However, at some points it gave me the creeps and the chills........."
5,Awesome book,Great book full of mystery and horror about a ten year old girl in a twisted world. A fabulous read for 9+ years.
5,Coraline and her adventures through the door,"This story would be in the same genre as Alice in Wonderland. It is a strange, dark novel that appeals to both the young and young at heart. It is the story of a heroine who must go to another world to save her family and other children trapped there. She is momentarily sidetracked by the appeal of this world where she can do anything she likes, and everything from the living toys to the plays of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's (her neighbors) counterparts seems tailored to her entertainment. The plot thickens when the door back to her reality is locked and the stakes for her soul and those of her parents are threatened to be trapped forever. This is definitely an interesting story for all ages, another of Neil Gaiman's great achievements."
4,Deliciously creepy!,"Coraline's parents are too busy to give her the attention she craves and no one can seem to figure out how to pronounce her name correctly. While exploring one day, she finds a secret door that leads into a parallel universe where her ""other parents"" dote on her and everyone says her name properly. At first, she enjoys her ""other home,"" but when she is ready to return to her normal life, she realizes that her ""other mother"" has other plans. Coraline must find a way to be brave and outsmart the evil ""other mother"" in order to find her way home.Deliciously creepy!"
4,deliciously creepy,"I love Neil Gaiman, I love children's stories and I love things with a touch of creepiness and this delivered! I picked this up at a bookstore on a whim and read through it in almost one sitting. A great tale of otherworldly creepiness about a little girl who goes through a strange adventure and in the end appreciates the parents she slightly took for granted. Kind of reminds me of tales like Alice and Wonderland, Labrynth, Spirited Away, etc.I think this would also be great to read to children about 11 and up or so, assuming they can handle the creepy images. I actually found the pictures even scarier than the story!"
4,"Not the best book but a great book, PIJH 7th grade","This was a good book.Probably one of the best books I have ever read.It is very mysterious, but yet very creepy.Coraline lives with a lot of people.Also, she lives with a creepy man and two women.I don't Know how she can handle it.You will be amazed of the courageous things that happen.Neil Gaiman has done a great job with his stories.I can't wait for his next adventures........."
2,Uneven and not-so Scary,"Neil Gaiman is definitely a creative powerhouse, there's not questioning that. But this book really isn't worth all the hype surrounding it.Some of the imagery created by Gaiman is very clever and chilling, but the execution falls flat. It reads like a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book, and I never really felt the main character was in any real danger (just creepy circumstances). And even though the evil mother character is very well written, her actions and origins seem a bit vague so it all falls a bit flat.Although the book's jacket touts it as the next Alice in Wonderland, this book lacks the wit and charm to be a book for all ages. Kids will no doubt be frightened by by Gaiman's creepy imagery, but as they grow older, they'll begin to wonder exactly why as this book lacks the bite it's teeth imply...I'd stick to Road Dahl or The Brothers Grim..."
2,i think that you will like it it gets you nervis,This book is prity cool it gets you interested .It is a funny book this is what it is about. It is adout a littol girl named corilin she lost her mom and dad and she whent to go find them and she got lost in another world. and then she meets a creepy girl that thinks she is her mom. so the girl acts like she is here mom and she tris to mack the girl like her. i didnt like the book but i think you will like it.
2,Creepy for kids? Try creepy for me!,"I've read Gaiman before, and this wasn't quite what I was expecting... Seriously, this book creeped me out. It tells the story of a young girl, Coraline, who discovers there is a whole parallel world on the other side of one of the doors in her flat. It has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it, but the illustrations enhance the creepiness of what Coraline finds in the other world. My roommate wouldn't even look at the front of the book! :) Coraline makes several trips to the other world...but gets stuck there. Strange overall story..."
2,"Scary, unique...but....","This was unique, yes, and there were some creepy parts....but...I don't know...nothing in it really held me and made me 'love' this book.This is a young adult book, but, it can easily be for adults as well...I just think the story drug out throughout the book, then ended all of a sudden....I hate that when books/writer's do that....Grrrrr....I have tried reading other Gaiman books too, and I think his writing style just isn't for me.Too bad."
3,Left me wanting...,"Though I do like the author's works, he seems to leave me wanting. I'm always hopeful of a better experience from his writing, but seem to come up short each time. Coraline was no different in that respect. It had a creepy feeling, but never really hit me the way I'd hoped it would. Maybe the animated version is better at delivering. Not a bad read by any means, but just kind of, not there in the end."
4,"If you liked the movie, you'll like the book better!","I saw the movie before reading the book, so I knew to expect a creepy kid's story.While not as scary or creepy as I was expecting it to be (I read reviews stating that the book is sooooo much creepier than the movie!), there were a few parts in the book that weren't in the movie and added to the creepiness of the story.If you like weird creepy kid books, don't miss this one by Neil Gaiman!"
5,A creepy tale for all ages,"Again, Neil Gaiman reminds me why he is one of my very favorite authors. He just has a way with words, and he weaves stories supremely. Although Coraline is marketed as a children's tale, I stand by the fact the it is a story for all ages. A little bit Alice in Wonderland, a little bit Chronicles of Narnia, a little bit horror movie... Coraline is a creepy tale of a girl that learns of the subtle difference between what she wants and what she thinks she wants when the world she knows is on the line. Chilling and suspenseful, I'd recommend this book to fans of genres from dark fantasy to fairy tales. Seriously, just go read it. I don't care how old you are or what kind of books you normally read, you should give it a try."
5,I loved it one of my fav. books,I really do love this book because it its not the most original book but its spooky and entertaining so it makes me want more like a sequel would be amazing with more crazy twist i personally salute Neil Gaiman for his genious work I mean it is other than the other world pretty original.
5,"Saw the movie, reading the book",When I first saw the preview for Coraline I knew I had to see it. I love stop action animation and it makes me sad that not to many movies are made that way now a days. I loved the movie. I just have to say that book is a quick and easy read (because it is a children's book) but the story is a lot of fun. Coraline is charming. I wish I had read it when I was younger because I am sure I would have liked it even more
2,Definitely not all it's cracked up to be.,"If you're under 13, this book might be good for you. But the audience that enjoys Harry Potter will definitely not want to spend money at an overpriced bookstore for this book. I got it through my book club, so I can't complain, but it's just not that great.I'm sure by now you've heard the premise, but this book evidences something Gaiman once mentioned in his blog, ""plot coupons"". In this case, it's other children who've been caught by the Other Parents.The book is too straightforward and, while creepy enough to keep the interest of the target audience, is just not GOOD enough to justify Neil Gaiman's name being on it. I've enjoyed everything else Neil Gaiman has done (except Stardust, which really didn't do it for me), but Coraline just isn't that good. Sorry, Neil. Better luck next time."
3,Coraline- an o.k. book,"This book wasn't the best book but it wasn't the bad at all. I think it was not written in the best way possible, and I found some of the illustrations a little bit disturbing. Some detail in the book also creaped me out a little like sewing black button eyes into your skull. Now don't tell me thats not creapy! I don't think this book was the best, but i don't think it was bad at all, just like I said before."
2,Dark,"I will be ""kind"" in this review and just say, Gaiman seems to like ghosts (remember ""The Graveyard book""?).This little girl is stranded with a horrid ""other mother"" and other sordid characters ... for only two days? It seemed like years.This is a horror story for kids.Couldn't wait for it to end.Sorry."
2,Too much hype!,"Boy was this a letdown! Don't get me wrong, the writing is very solid, the story is interesting, but...the middle and the end is a build up to an ending that falls flat on its face. I guess there might be a sequel in the works, if so could you please have a story with some bite to it? This was not what I expected from Mr. Gaiman. Plus I could have done without the illustrations. (Not needed)"
5,Buttons are scary,"Coraline is an awesome book. The book is about a little girl named Coraline and her mom and dad. The family moves to a new house and for Coraline it is summer vacation so for Coraline that means no school for the summer. Now when it is summer vacation you probably jump up and down screaming yes or yeah. Well not for Coraline it is a summer she will always remember. One day Coralines mother asked Coraline if she would like to go to the store with her and Coraline ""says no."" Well Coralines mom never comes back home but someone is taking care of Coraline. A women with button eyes who calls herself Coralines other mother. Through the whole book Coraline is battling her other mother trying to get her real mom and dad back. I will not tell you if she gets her real parents back. I think this book was the best book I ever read this book definitely had me at the edge of my seat!!Written by:Rebecca Remhof"
3,Good Creepy Book for Older Children,"A decent creepy, surreal book. If I were 10-14 years old I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars, but it is a bit simple for an adult reader. For me it just barely passed the ""C. S. Lewis test"" of ""a children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest."""
4,Lovely tale of adventure for all ages.,"Coraline is a somewhat bored young girl in a new home. She's an explorer at heart, so she pokes about the new place - even into the dark corners best left undisturbed.A lovely book with a brave young protagonist, who takes matters into her own hands when things go awry at home, despite the warnings, dangers & the unknown. Only she could make things right.Meant for children, yes, but a nice, quick read for us old fogies, too."
5,coraline,this book was great it was thrilling and page turning it is my all time favorite book i could read it over and over again i loved it and i am sure everyone who loves scary and great books will love it
4,Fantastic!,"A great story, with interesting characters.I read this book in one go on the plane and I couldn't put it down.Lots of fun to read!"
5,Read it!,What a terrific book! I bough this for my 10 and 11 year old.....a boy and a girl. I read it first and could not put it down. My daughter fought me for it! An engaging story that has wonderful characters and a great twisted fantasy. This family gives it 5 stars! Read it!
4,Good,"I go into all of Neil Gaiman's books expecting to be blown away, and every single time it seems as though I'm going to be disappointed. Then, out of nowhere, something will come rising up out of the books and just bash me, forcing me to read more and more and more, as quickly as I can, to find out what will happen next.It was the same with this one. I didn't think I was into it until I realized that I was speed-reading it in a frantic effort to find out what would happen next as fast as possible.At the age of 19, I didn't find myself terrified by this book... but, had I read it between the ages f 6-10, I'm sure I would now have a terrible fear of waking up to find that my eyes had become buttons."
4,Coraline Through Bricks,"Coraline (not Caraline if you please) is a precocious, bored young girl. She likes to explore and, in her rented home, finds a door which, when opened, leads to a brick wall. No way through, or is there? There is, and Coraline finds it, and, like Alice through the looking glass, enters a twisted world which, in her case, resembles her own but is darkly different. A woman, resembling her mom, or a doll-like, button-eyed look-alike, wants her to stay in this new world, and takes steps to make sure Coraline does stay, so as to consume her soul. No doubt scary for the young, and still entertainingly good for the grownups.The limited signed version, (despite a typo) is a prize."
2,Bland fantasy,"I cannot say that I cared much for Coraline. I didn't hate it. I simply felt that it wasn't much of a story. Coraline is a bored little girl who likes exploring, so she heads (a la Alice) into a ""wonderland"" of sorts, only it is a rather bleek and scary place. There she encounters various characters and has an adventure. She ends up having to fight to make it back home.I am an adult who loves children's fantasies. Coraline was a short diversion. I would put it in the category of filler as we wait patiently for Harry Potter V."
2,Coraline,"I peronally disliked this book. It keep my attention with some horror.But i didnt like the horrible other parts.Like the the part with the talking cat and the other parents... that wasnt very intersting.A mutantes monster would have been way better.The only good part about this book was the disaperence of her parents, and the evil cat. The worst parts were everything else. The giant monster in the city was preety good. Also good pictures for everyhthing.The most understanding part was when coralines parents were missing and how she lived till she found out were the were. The missing parents was cool.That part was really good in detail of what she ate and acted as no parents where around.She also explained the cat very well. The theme seemed like a spooky/mysteriuos tone. :)"
2,Not so much scarey as really really ugly,"I give this book 2 stars for the writing talent the author has shown in the past and continues to display in this book. He obviously has a 5-star talent. But this book is not so much scarey as truly creepy -- and not in a nice way. This book is just ugly. And the pictures were even uglier. Think of the emotional reaction to something really sad and sick -- like maybe chronic skin infection exhudate, and that is my reaction to this story. E-e-e-w-h! If that is what you like, then the rating should be 5-star. But if you want a nice day with nice images in your brain, then avoid this book."
2,"If Garth Nix Smoked Crack, This Would Be the Result","This was by far the most bizarre book I've ever read. I began reading it, expecting a dark fantasy similar to Garth Nix's work. I was obviously mistaken. What I really ended up reading was what could be passed off as a Garth Nix crack-smoking fantasy. It made very little sense, and in some places made no sense at all. It reminded me of the strangeness of Alice in Wonderland. Usually I keep an open mind about different styles of writing, but this was just plain weird. Many reviews said this book is frightening, so I expected to get some thrills and chills out of reading it. Neil Gaiman tries very hard to freak me out, but does not succeed. The most chilling part of the entire book was the illustrations, which were disturbingly creepy. By the time I finished reading the book, I closed it wondering what, exactly, had just happened."
2,"Definetly, not for adults","Coraline had to have been one of the worst books Ive read. I dont know, maybe Im to old for this type of book but I am a huge fan of Gaiman and I read everything by him. Its hard to believe that Mr. Gaiman wrote one of my favorite stories, the Sandman, and turns around and writes this mess. Ive read American Gods wich was about a 3 star, Good Omens, wich I liked alot, probably a 4 1/2 star and every Sandman book out there. Mr. Gaiman really accelerates in the comic world. His death series, Murder Mysteries along with the sandman series are definetly looking into if you have not read them.Someone said on the back cover I believe that ""Coraline will finally surpass Alice in Wonderland"" must have lost his marbles. Not even close!!! If I wasnt such a Gaiman fan, I would have rated this a 1 star.Gaiman spends to much time building up the story only to disappoint you with a short plot. I could go on and on but like I said, not a book for adults."
