5,This book was great,"Even though the marketplace is getting bigger, many publications today are either ""academic level"" or ""dummed down"" for general consumption. This book is positioned between these two extremes and is just what I was looking for. One of many surprising things I learned was how the AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was the largest consumer if integrated circuits in the 1960s and was mainly responsible for kicking off this industry."
2,not worth the extra $$,"first of all, this picture is misleading, these do not have the string ties, they are the instaclip version, as the description says. the mantle itself is good. it does everything that a mantle should do. it holds atomized gas and makes a bright light. my gripe is with the instaclip. i read the istructions and proceeded very slowly, with my tongue on the side of my lip. but as soon as the green border of the mantle touches the lantern interface, the clip turns coward, screams like a little girl, and detaches without a single backward glance. you need to work the mantle on a bit, but the clip does not want to work. it has been purchased and paid for and is now ready to enjoy its 4 year term without having to think or work. o, wait, mantles, yes, mantles. the mantle itself gets a 5 star, but the clip gets a 0 since i could not get it to do anything other than fall off and i ended up using pliers and my fingers. save your money and buy the regular style."
3,Meh.,I guess if you screw up the first one installing it you figure out how the second one works and don't screw that one up.
1,Not an improvement,"What is pictured is the traditional slip and pull mantle. Past experience with them has been excellent. Open mantle, slip over gas vent, tighten and light, np.Instaclip is poorly designed in its engagement and release, which may be the reason for the mantle not to setup properly.Used to think...gas good, battery bad. Now LED rules"
4,A Good Collection,"I will admit: I like other groups (e.g. Everlife) better. But these girls have great harmonies.I liked ""I Believe"", ""You Get Me"", ""Unchangeable"", ""Beautiful Name"", ""Scream"" and ""Even If""."
2,No Longer Made In England,"I have purchased these plates from Amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in England. So, I ordered more to go along with my current set to find that now they are made in India and were not of the same quality as those made in England. I sent them back. I will say that had I not already had the more detailed & colorful items, I might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than I did."
4,Colorful turkey,"I bought 3 sets of these plates as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law, she really wanted turkey motif dinnerware, and Amazon was the only place I could find them on such short notice (because I didn't buy them at an ""after Thanksgiving"" sale). She really loves them. The only thing I wasn't pleased by was the depth of the colors. They look nicer in the online photo, than they do in reality. They are a little on the pinkish colored side instead of the darker brown and green as shown in the picture. Other than that, I really am pleased with them as well, and I got them shipped to me right in time for Christmas Day !"
5,Good item,I purchased this item because my dog has fits during thunder storms. I was tired of using drugs so I thought I would give this a try. To my supprise It actually worked. I would recoment this for any dog that has problems with loud noises or bad weather.
1,"""Original"" but not ""Real Deal""","See recommended product link:Thundershirt Dog Anxiety Treatment Wrap, Large, Heather GreyI purchased because I believed it was a""Thunder Shirt"" , but it is not & and is too loose to be beneficial for anxiety. I am sorry to say I do not recommend. Spend your money on a Thunder Shirt, which I purchased recently after the ""Anxiety Wrap""."
1,Anxiety Wrap Causes Anxiety of owner,"Whether anxiety wrap is of value is almost a moot point. The instructions are worthless in putting the wrap on. Two master level individuals couldn't figure it out. Furthermore, even though we called the same day received for a refund - they refused. They promised a video which would be instructional to our online email - and it hasn't been sent.Anxiety Wrap grade F-"
2,disappointed,I just could never get the right size for my dog. It might work if I could get it tight enough.
1,money well wasted,"Product did the exact opposite of its purpose. My dogs anxiety and nerves were highly elevated after placing the awkwardly constructed wrap on him. He wouldn't even move, just sit there staring and shaking uncontrollably. I left it on him for 1-2 days to give it a chance but had enough and took it off the poor guy and instantly he started running around again. Money well wasted...."
3,Barely works,"Unfortunately the product does not work that great on our beagle in thunderstorms. He still is scared and pants a great deal. It is disappointing that he only gets a small amount of relief. We will persevere including providing him with incentives to get better - praise, rewards etc.."
4,Calms an Anxious Bassett,"This is a great product! It was suggested to us by our vet. We have a Bassett Hound that is very anxious, especially during thunder storms. The day I received the shipment, I took it home and put it right on him - within 10 minutes he was curled up in his nest bed sound asleep. There were no storms in the area at that time, but, as the directions say, I was giving a ""trial run."" Any time he gets upset or anxious, I pull out this shirt and he comes up to me with his head up ready for me to put it on him.I am very pleased with the results. It's nice to get some sleep at night during a storm!!"
2,Did nothing.,"I thought the fabric was thin when I first opened the package, but I wanted to try anything to calm my Dalmation during storms. Recent weather being what it has, I got to try it out soon. I put it on her correctly, but it didn't wrap very tightly (even though she is in the middle of the weight recommendation). I withheld the Rescue Remedy and Stress Relief essential oil that I usually give her at this point. I waited about 20 minutes to see if it would work once she got use to it a little. There was no calming effect that I could tell--she actually seemed more uncomfortable. I gave her other calmatives, but left the wrap on so she may get more use to it. I repeated this the next storm as well, but with no better results."
3,Anxiety with the Anxiety Wrap,"The idea of the Anxiety Wrap is awesome!! We have a high-strung, high-anxiety, 8 year old beagle. The instructions for putting the Anxiety Wrap on our beagle were very specific, as if it could be a ""process"" to get this wrap on the dog. We followed the instructions and yes, it was very stressful to get the front paws into the wrap. Our beagle was growling and snapping at me, so rather than being bit, I decided to return the purchase. It is really not your fault....like I said in the beginning, the idea is great!! It was just not going to work for our dog."
1,our dogs are too smart for the wrap!,"Tried on our Springer for travel anxiety and he walked right out of the wrap in only 10 minutes. Our son tried on his Australian shepard for jumping and barking, didn't affect her at all."
2,Sizing,The description of this item is not accurate. There is little info about sizing but I ordered what seemed to be the correct size. It was huge and did not come close to fitting my small dog. I returned the item and chose to buy the authentic Thundershirt since the size charts are so much clearer.
1,The sizing was too short for my dog,"I measured my dog and ordered an XL which should have fit but it was too short. It was pulling at his neck and all he wanted to do was scratch. It made him itchy. Not so much the material but just wearing it made him itchy and he was afraid to scratch with it on lol, My poor boy. I am not crazy about this item at all. My dog Bandit has anxiety when he is around people. He is shy and I was hoping this would help but it didnt help at all. You should do something about the sizing because you may have the girth dementions right, but the length is way to short for a med-large dog. When it was on Bandit it looked nothing like it does in the pictures. The hole where the head goes was all the way pulled down past his shoulders, thats how short it was on him. It was also a bit complicated getting it on."
1,Anxiety Wrap -- Crap,My dog has more anxiety when I put this on her. Plus the directions are NOT very clear.Plan on returning
3,Didnt quite work on my dog...,"My dog was experiencing anxiety after we moved into a new home. This wrap was recommended....however, for us...it didnt seem to work. I have heard that it can work wonders for other dogs....just not mine. That being said, the company was wonderful when I wanted to send it back. They are a good company to work with.Also....make sure you get the right size....small is for medium dogs, not small dogs."
5,This has worked SO Well!,This product has worked very well for our dog. He is afraid of thunderstorms.
3,Anxiety Wrap,"I ordered the XX Small but it was way to big for my small breed dog (under 7 pounds). Also, don't like the piece that goes behind/under the tail."
1,Did nothing,"This did not help at all with separation anxiety. We will likely return it, but I will check with manufacturer first."
5,This works!,Ordering another one for our second dog. This really seems to work and help those poor pups who are afraid of fireworks and thunder. I use it in combination with a pet calmer.
2,Didn't do much....,"After much debate, I got this over Thunder Shirt/Coat (not sure of the name anymore) but it didn't do much for my dog either for her ""fear of the unknown"" (people, dogs, fallen leaves....) or anxiety in a car ride. Never used it much after a few tries. My other dog who has none of the ""anxiety symptoms"" likes the wrap so I let her wear it sometimes just for ""fun"" so it's not a total ""waste"" of money. :)"
4,It does help with calming...,"I have a overly anxious German Shepherd that has to follow me all over the place. I work with him, to help, but it's not enough. Combined with training, the DAP diffuser and this wrap, he's doing MUCH better. Instead of coming home to him tearing down a metal gate in the ""dog room"", I have a behaved shepherd lying down enjoying his chews and bones and NO destroyed kitchen and litter boxes!I did notice a change when I put it on him, and I'm happy for that. He doesn't even mind wearing it!This product runs a bit small in the chest/front leg area. It was quite difficult getting his front paws into the wrap. However, it's more lose in the tummy and rear. Odd.4 stars for effectiveness, one less star for overall fit."
2,Didn't Work,"Did not work for my chihuahua. I bought it to help with problems riding in the car. I guess I expected it to work immediately and that's the problem, I wasn't patient enough."
3,Original anxiety wrap,I bought this thinking it would help my dog with her anxiety over thunder and fireworks. I felt it didn't help do a thing.
2,Design needs work,I bought the small size to fit a beagle. There was insufficient Velcro to make a snug fit. Velcro should have been two strips that go under dog's belly to adjust properly. Shirt had only one horizontal velcro strip proving one size doesn't fit all dogs
5,"So Far, So Good!","I still think this is voodoo of some sort, but it works. We made it through the 4th of July without ANY distress this year! I didn't think there was any hope for a 12-year old dog. She still does have issues with t-storms but this thing seems to have her ""come down"" a whole lot faster. I'm going to order a bigger one now for my younger dog. In a million years, I never thought this would help. Who knew?"
2,Not sure if it works at all,"One dog of ours has severe thunder/fireworks/firecrack phobia. We tried this wrap a few times in the summer and we weren't sure if it worked at all. All in all we didn't see any significant behavior improvements after using it. It only creates some psychological comfort on us to ""perceive"" it might work since we were pretty helpless and heart wrenching seeing her paralyzing panic during the stormy season."
1,Sucked,Terrible. Dog just wanted it off. Didn't calm at all. Not worth the money at all. Don't waste your time.
2,"My dog is a ""special"" case",This did not work for my 16 year-old dog who was experiencing serious panic attacks.I can only speak to my situation.
1,Doesn't work!,"Difficult to put on. Came with no instructions. Velcro straps included, but no directions as to placement. Didn't work when we finally figured how to put it on. Waste of money."
3,Nice fit good quality but....,"I ordered this vest for my 11 year old husky/border collie mix. She is afraid of high winds and heavy rain on the roof. I notice a little difference with it on her but not a whole lot. Was expecting more but every dog is different. I would say to try it, it never hurts to see if something will help a nervous dog."
2,Anxiety Wrap,"This is a well made product. However, it did not work for my little dog at all. I followed the directions and it still did not work. I was very disappointed."
3,Afraid of EVERYTHING,"My spaniel, ""Lil'Richard"" is a beautiful, wonderful companion, but he is terrified of storms, visitors, or anything that he can't identify with. This wrap has gotten him through a few storms that made me shake. I do wish that it had a thicker, more sturdy material over the elastic wrap. Our golden lab thinks that it is something that he should be able to drag Lil'R around with, and has managed to rip a few holes into it. I find it still serves is purpose, but I don't know if I would buy another, until they find a way to devise ""stronger""!"
3,Original Anxiety Wrap,Recommended by my vet for my anxious staffy. Early days yet and I live in a tropical environment. Expect to make further comment in a couple of months. So far so good.
2,Not for separation anxiety!,I think this product may work for dogs with thunder anxiety but it did absolutely nothing for my dog's separation anxiety. She didnt mind wearing it but she couldn't really walk with the straps on her legs. She has moderate anxiety and I saw no difference in her behavior. Not worth the money for me.
4,Surprisingly lucid book about Austrian Napoleonic politics,"I have to agree with the earlier two reviews that this book isn't really about Marie-Louise. It rather focuses on the personalities and events surrounding Austrian dealings with Napoleonic France. Napoleon of course comes out as the dominant personality of the age. However, Count Metternich and Emperor Francis I are also brilliantly sketched in, the latter especially in his dealings with his daughter. Surprisingly, I found this coverage to be the main strength of the book as the writer clearly has an excellent grasp of the flow of events and writes with a clear narrative style.Thankfully, the writer minimises the overly sentimental quotes from Marie-Louise's diaries and also the unnecessary gossips about her amorous affairs.Marie-Louise is really a walk-on character, to pivot the story and to give the book an interesting title. She could not have been better presented."
2,Yak Butter Blues,"Very disappointing... The author and his wife travel through an extremely poor country, Tibet & Nepal. Instead of being self suffient, they rely on the kindness of villagers to supply them with lodging and food for themselves and their horse. They offer to pay very meager sums of money(and often haggle)for the villagers hospitality. It is a shame the author does not show more respect and generosity for these villagers. Instead of haggling with the locals over insignificant amounts of money, the author should of been a generous friendly American offering to help. It only takes small amount of money to help the people in this part of the world. If the author could not of spared the extra couple of hundred dollars to be a responsible traveler, he should not of embarked on this journey."
1,I hated this book,"This book was not about a spiritual journey as it states. Rather it is a whiney tale of rich people using poor people for their own betterment. Their reason for the trip? No other westerners had done it, and they'd do it illegally if they had to. Then they complain when someone chooses NOT to allow them to spend the night in their one room house, or don't want to share their already sparce meal with others. When asked for compensation, they haggle over what they should have to spend. This is truly an UNenlightening story."
2,Doen't connect with iPhone using most shell cases,"I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip, it's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus doesn't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4. Very poor design on Belkin's part."
3,"Cheap, and I'm not talking about the price.","I am unsatisfied with this product. It did not come in official packaging, merely a tiny ziplock bag. The ends that connect to the iPhone and laptop looked dirty. I was told I would be given a new product, not something used. You are better off paying a couple extra dollars at Walmart where you can be sure that your product will be new and unused."
3,Decent Quality. Too Big,"Quality of cable appears good. While the connector is contoured like the stock iPhone connector, it is too fat to fit through the Otterbox case on my 3GS. I'll be looking elsewhere as taking the phone out of the case isn't an option."
1,Very disappointed,Very cheaply made. Stopped working almost immediately.I would not recommend this to anyone.Inexpensive is one thing cheap garbage is another.
5,Great product. Zero problems,"You have to be gentle with retractable cables, but the product is great. Zero problems over the months I've been using it."
3,Decent,"Does what it is supposed to do. Nothing more nothing less.Unfortunately after about two months of use, although the retraction mechanism is still working fine, the wire itself has become kinked and is does not lay straight when pulled out. Also the connection between the wire and 30-pin connector has begun to break and will most likely stop working after a few more weeks.Three stars because its cheap, and does what it says its supposed to do. Can't complain though, worse has happened to more expensive and seemingly better made cables in a shorter time."
3,Wire frayed after only a week.,"Great concept, not too sturdy a product. If the wire didn't get frayed and make me unsure of the safety of continued use, I'd enjoy it much more than I did."
3,Unfortunate,"I am a long-time Wilkie Fan and have been following the band for several years...but I was irked by the band's carelessness in producing a record that pales in comparison to their other efforts. The three stars they earned are for a few total gems on the record (Raising of the Patriarchs, Millie's Song, Savannah, Steel and Stone), which by far make up for the album's shortcomings and deem it worth owning, however, tracks that are repeats from previous releases were heart-wrenchingly blah and approaching off-key compared to the quality of the same tracks on other albums. Eek. I'm not sure how this one passed by the censors. Still a huge fan of the band and would suggest buying this and all their other albums. Great guys, solid band, poor judgment."
5,Great Album,"Just a straight-up great rock album. Catchy licks and lyrics. You will love this album if you buy it. Saw them live twice, including last night, and they performed a really tight set. I think the first song -- all instrumental -- is one of their best live songs, because of the way it builds and by the end is just blowing the roof off the place."
5,This album is a classic.,"This is one of those rare albums that defy labelling; it's full of rich, inspirational, imaginative music. A year on from its release, its delicate tunes and haunting atmosphere come back to me and demand replaying, which can't be said of 99 percent of contemporary albums."
3,It's Okay,"There's nothing revolutionary here. But the music is enjoyable enough to listen to. Forgettable, but enjoyable, nonetheless."
4,Actual tunes!,"This album is a ray of hope in a musical climate full of whining tattooed brats playing sub-par Ramones knock offs. There is actual chord structure here! And melody! Ambulance LTD in the best possible way harkens back to the best of the UK shoe gazing/BritPop era, whilst still managing to embrace NYC. The Velvets influence is firmly in place, as evidenced by the languid cover of ""The Ocean"", as well as nods to U2 (""Primitive"" is a close relation to Zooropa's ""Dirty Day"") and a slight excursion into alt.country via Brooklyn, the wonderful ""Anecdote"". The rest is all lovely but crisp swirling guitars that never get in the way of a good tune, as evidenced in tracks like ""Ophelia"" and ""Swim"". Do buy this album, without hesitation. One word of warning, however...the 'poseur' label which I have seen attached to this band so often may stem from the pouty band photo that can be found in this album's CD booklet, so if you are bothered by such things, don't open it!"
1,"WARNING, WARNING DO NOT BUY","You might wonder why good music such as ambulance is something i'd warn against? Well its not their music, they have sublime melodies and good tunes. However, some of us with more advanced players:CANNOT PLAY THIS CD DUE TO OUT OF DATE CD PROTECTIONCmon guys, if we cant play your cd, theres no way you're gonna turn a profit or get PR. I hope this is solved in a later release, i hate losing bands to bad marketing ploys."
3,boring,"I picked this up at Tower becuase it was cheap. Plus I heard it was an OK album. The problem with this album is that it has the right parts (good singing, pretty good instruments) but the melodies never popped and the songs never quite went anywhere. It got better towards the end but there is nothing compelling to listen over and overMaybe their next effort will be better."
2,Pretty mediocre,Not really all that great. Even the CD booklet is too glossy. The music sounds like drudge - maybe one good song about the singer calling his father from what seems like a war.
3,Manufactured NY Boy Band?,"I heard a rumor that this band was put together - ""making the band"" style.Like, their label searched for reasonably attractive guys who couldsay they lived in Brooklyn and had your basic indie rock look - and then auditioned them and formulated a NY band that no one in NY had ever heard of before. Then they hired some songwriters and stylists and a few vocal sessions and photo shoots later - here's Ambulance. I thought it was just a rumor, but then I heard this CD and thought it might be true."
2,the band isnt that bad,"this band isnt really all that bad they can keep a beat and arent that bad musicans but for some reason this album just did not grow on me. This band pretty much wears there influences (velvet underground the beatles etc) on thier sleeves so alot of this album feels like you have already heard it before. The singing is personally not my style, and alot of the music on this just kinda drags along. If your looking for something that sounds new look elsewhere, but im sure a fan of older rock an enjo some of the hooks on this album."
1,Boring.,The Strokes suck and so does Ambulance. New York has always been a city that has a much overrated and overhyped music scene. Were the Ramones really that good? Well they're geniuses compared to any of these clowns but that isn't saying much.
2,Not Worth it!,"I didn't enjoyed this at all, sorry to say! But I also purchased Theological immortal romance, which I can suggest. Which was a wonderful, uplifting, spiritual and romantic experience."
5,Best damn album of the summer!,"I'm telling you, whether you see these guys live, or they appear to you through your headphones, Scissors for Lefty are here to stay. This is the best damn band that nobody knows about - and that window is closing fast. I pride myself in staying ahead of the curve, and these guys are light years ahead of me - or any other artist(s) I see trudging their way through LA or NYC. The lead singer is probably one of the most charasmatic showmen I have seen in a long time, he's up there with Mick, Thom and Elvis - and the band along with him (not behind him) are incredible. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, then buy Bruno -which they self-produced. Then you can be the coolest kid in your Ghetto Ways."
4,Secret Music Ways,"I loved ""Secret Ghetto Ways"" from an internet preview download months before this album was released. At first blush, the rest of the album felt ""poppy"" and lit up my music snob defenses. But I had so much respect given what I'd already heard, it got more and more playtime in the car. The lyrics are great - and timely ""Mama Your Boys Will Find a Home"" was the first song my new apartment heard. Get past the poppy front and there're wild vocals and base lines to live by."
4,I might have been hoping for too much,"I think that it is not so easy to get good pressure from such a little ball. In the event you have one of those baby-snot removers, it is a similar puff. It wasn't very expensive, though."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this to give to a friend who will be relocating soon and would need an alarm clock. First thing is that it is huge, certainly not suitable for a bedside alarm. Second, the alarm was extremely weak, you would have to be a light sleeper in order to hear this when it went off. Third, it is definately for a kid (who wouldn't need an alarm anyway) by it's design. And finally, fourth, it is very cheaply made and definately not worth the money I paid for it. All in all, I will not give it to my friend as I would be embarrassed to be giving such a gift. I would rate is a a no-star item."
4,poetic justice,"The real character of this book, if it was the famous London based trader, has been living in agony and he will die in agony.Cancer found its way to him. Is this food for thought? what glory is there in manipulating your way out to the top, rising on bodies of global victims. Anyone listening??"
5,The Next American Metropolis,Peter Calthorpe provides exceptional data supported analysis to support his thinking. It was one of my first reads on the subject of New Urbanism and is an excellent read even for the novice planner or a citizen trying to understand planning thought. Every city planner should consider this a must read too.
5,The myth of exodus and genesis and the exclusion of their African Origins,"The book is very informative, good educational tool. The book should have incoporate all the parts instead of just one."
4,Good information.,"Good informative book. I suggest the author become a little more politically correct. However, this is still a great book and challenges our established mores which are based upon lies, deception and racism."
1,give me a break,"This so called book is less than 30 one sided pages.Unless you are a moron you wont learn anything from it.I may seem harsh but it's the truth.Any thing in this book? you can get from the internet for free.You might as well take the money to a casino and at least have some fun.I'm not a gambler,so you know how bad it is.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,Rug Pad,"Had a weird chemical odor at first but that went away after a day or two. Good rug pad, keeps the rugs in place."
4,Pad,Using with a rug on a ceramic tile floor. Works easily as well as expected and I have no problem recommending it.
1,"bad software ,bad support","After instalation computer freeze and crash.The same thing on second computer.Iolo support respond after 24hrs,recommending installationupdated version from Iolo web site.After instaling SM 6m things got worst, lost network adaptersmaking recovery from network drive impossible.Another Iolo support e_mail arrived after 2 days sugestingupgrade to second updated version SM 6n.it was too much for me, reformated computer drives, andreintal Windows XP OS. on two affected computers."
2,This book cannot help much to develop fluent German.,"After hearing this course you are able to compose very primitive German phrases only. Don't expect any fluency because the vocabulary is too basic, don't expect you can understand German speech after hearing this course. This course just gives you very rough idea what German language is. Very funny - their first mistake is located right on the 1st page - ""drie"" instead of ""drei"". So if you want to learn German - buy another course."
4,Devon & Kat's story,"Finally, a book in the series where the title & picture on thecover make sense with the storyline. This was an enjoyable read.Devon is the toughest nut to crack of the brothers thus far (onlyone left to go). It was so sweet, the way he was always going tovisit Kat at her workshop.The intimate scene was interesting ... a smidge bit kinky at first.Also, in this part of the story, guinea's are mentioned, so I wascurious as to their size. I did some research, and they are quiet large, actually. The hero liked her 'guineas'.I loved the way the ring was 'passed on' to Marcus at the endof this book (Marcus is in the last book, ""Lady in Red"").I would give this book, and the others so far, 4 1/2 stars each.They are near perfect books and I honestly can recommend each one."
5,Love her books,Keepsyou wanting to read more and also has humor. I Love a book with humor. It was a good read.
2,"Repeating the scenes, losing the wow factor","I enjoy Hawkins plots, but the sameness of the descriptions of the physical attractions and the seductions of the heroines by the St. John brothers begins to make this series one where you simply flip through page after page to see how the plot unfolds rather than really read. And once you've read one of her love sccenes, you've read them all."
1,tru glo springfield xd,"i hated this product, it was the worst money i have ever spent! the front sight did not even work! rear wasnt that great either. i would recomened the truglo tritium fiber optic night sights if you are considering purchasing this item, they are much better. its worth the extra money to get the fiber optics!"
4,car starter,This product would be usable on some vehecles. It would not work on the F250. It was returned in exchange for other products. Service was good.
2,the weak pianoforte,"In Schobert's chamber music the main protagonist is the keyboard. In this recordong the pianoforte of 1820 is weak and seems to be an accompaniment to the strings. The musicians should have used a modern piano and played the pieces in the academic tradition. The music is nice, but what a stupid idea it was to use the squeaky and weak pianoforte!"
2,"Outdated, not a good read for the new mediator","I am a formerly practicing litigator working towards becoming a mediator and have picked up several books along the way. Linda Singer is a pioneer in the field of ADR, but in this book focuses too much on examples which are historical at this point. Not that history doesn't serve its place, but the examples are too complicated for an introductory text and the reasoning behind the decisions (in these cases) to choose ADR likely has changed given that mediation really started exploding around the late 90s and this book was published in 1994. If you are an experienced mediator, this book may be of some interest. But for the new comers there are many other available books."
4,One Passion Two Loves Excavation of Troy,"This is not a review but a request in asking anyone reading this if you know of a book on the excavation of Troy; title is;One passion Two Loves, a story of Dr Heinrich Schliemann and his excavation of Troy. Ilost this beloved book in a flood and I would like to purchase a used edition now. Can anyone help me? Thank-you. sandimsheridan@shaw.ca"
3,Fun read,"This book is pretty much a slug fest from beginning to end. There isn't a lot to the story, but it is still a fun read. Of course the death of Superman was a pretty big story when it happened, and is something almost every comic fan should probably read. This whole book is Doomsday destroying stuff, then beating on the Justice League, and then fighting equally with Superman until they both fall, so it is like an entertaining summer movie that you enjoyed, but won't leave you thinking afterwards."
3,Review of Death of Superman,"I found this alright. The drawings are nice, and the themes of relentless justice and relentless evil are strong, but the novel doesn't really touch on any pressing or revealing moral issues. The ethics of this comic book are too straightforward to be truly enjoyable.I know very little about comics, so don't take my opinion in these matters too seriously."
5,Still a fav!!,"After all these years I just picked this up again on a whim while at Borders. The girlfriend couldnt understand why at thirty I would do it, but then she read it and was sobbing by the end!This is one of those works that you get more out of when youre older so you can really wrap your mind around it's core values: honor, love, hate, sacrifice. This one will stay with me forever until I can share it with my first child.The last few pages are forever engrained into my mind as the narration reads through the closing moments of who Superman was to everyone, with the last line in particular ""This is the day,--where a Superman died."""
4,Great Action,"There are comics that make have revolutionary writing and make you think (this is not it) and then there are really exciting, thrilling, non-stop action comics (this is it!) so if you enjoy the latter you will enjoy this book. There are some people who complain about the politics that concern the making of this book and to that, who cares, it's just a fictious story. True, it is controversial to kill of the Man of Steel but the actual fight between Superman and Doomsday literally spans several issues so Superman's death did not result from a small battle. Contrary to what people say, I think the writers are wise not to give Doomsday any history or have him talk. Doing any of these two things will result in your opponent getting the upperhand. It is very exciting and emotional at the end and the artwork is pretty decent especially in the last or two issues."
2,Supes Dies. Audience Falls Asleep,"This is the once-controversial story where Superman fights the big bad Doomsday and dies (for about five months). While much of what followed this story - collected in two other books - is very good - this tale of violence and meaningless self-sacrifice is pretty lousy. It's a lot of fighting and death, and nothing else.There are a lot of good Superman trade paperbacks out there. This isn't one of them. Better to save your money for one of them."
4,Tastes great but could be better,"Collects the Doomsday storyline that ran in the Superman comics. One of the hardest hitting comic stories of the 90s. This one reminded us why we Superman is still the premier superhero of them all. Not in many occasions has Superman fought harder in his whole life than in this story. Because of his superpowers we never could see the one moment when he is ready to sacrifice his life to save others. Here we find out. There were so many moments in this book: the fall of the Justice League, the efforts made to stop Doomsday, and the death of the Man of Steel. There were a few things that disappointed me and that's because for most of the story, it's just Superman and Doomsday slugging it out. I had wanted to see Superman save more people, see him pushed even more to his limits than he ever realized and a better ""deal the final blow"" to stop his enemy. But this is all a prelude to some of the best Superman stories ever told. :)"
3,168 pages of punching,I would have hoped they would have put more thought into how to kill the greatest superhero ever but they didnt. Its pretty much 168 pages of Superman punching Doomsday. No plot twists nothing clever no surprises. Superman meets a monster as tough as him and they punch each other a lot.
3,It delivers what it promises,"The death of superman is exactly what it sounds like...the death of superman. In this story, Superman fights an unknown creature called Doomsday (who is for one reason or other hell-bent on destruction) and falls in battle. The story is fast paced and has pages filled with superman and Doomsday swapping hits and all-in-all racking up a huge amount of collateral damage. In the end, Big Blue dies. This story came out when I was in junior high and at that time I felt it was the best book I had ever read but now, it is hard not to look at the numerous plot holes and loose threads in the story. But comics has matured and has come a long way but this story is still worth picking up for the buzz it generated. It's fun to read but don't expect anything Alan Moore-esque or Jeph Loeb type writing."
2,story no action yes,Wow. This book is so so. Now one there is no story no plot no twist.It seem that this bookis all action no story and citter chat that has nothing to do with this comic. i meen realy if super man is the mane carecter shy are all the other super heroes in this.I meen doomsday fights him whith pne hand in a steel shackle. when they all attack him at wonce then the shackle breek. i meen who the hell would free his other hand when he is already kicking there ass. they dont even tell you how he came to be or why he wuz in chains. if you are looking for only action this is for you
3,The Death of Superman,it wasn't what I expected it to be honestly . But its a nice story and I'm always a number 1 Superman fan .
3,"Same old, same old...","I like comics... I like Superman...When people said that this was a great comic, one of the best etc..., of course I bought it, and I liked it, it was ok, just like most other comics that I buy.The best ever? Not likely. This was just Doomsday, a big, bad guy with no mind, just rage and destructiveness wandering around beating up super heroes and breaking things. No heroes can handle it, so Superman comes in to save the day. No imagination or inventiveness from the writers, just smack, bang, crash... fight scene after fight scene and that's about all.It's a bit of a joke to call it the best comic ever, or even the best Superman comic ever, or even all that good a comic really. The only big deal is in the title, and DC could let Superman stay dead... of course not."
2,Not Worth The Money,I read this book expecting to read a epic story of superman's death. Instead i get a story with absolutely no story. It starts with superman saving lois thats good. Then for a few pages you doomsday trying rip out off a box. The reason why no explanation. it just happens. Then for the whole book he just kicks the crp out of superman. No character building no strong story just him beating the crap out of people. Near the end doomsday beats everyone. superman says that HE is weak and doomsday is still going strong. Then out of nowhere they punch each other and they BOTH die. It is stated right before this happens that doomsday = strong superman = weak. It makes no sense. The art is good and the fight is beautifully drawn. other then that i say skip this. Don't buy into the hype saying that is a epic story. Its not i say skip it.
4,nice looking,"This knife looks nice, did come sharp. I haven't tried to sharpen it yet but will soon...we'll see. But other than that, it's sturdy feeling and not too heavy"
1,End-of-life in 2006,The SPA2100 was discontinued by in 2006 and firmware is no longer available from Cisco. It would have been helpful to know this before I wasted my time ordering this and trying to set it up only to find that it could lock up under high network load. The version of the firmware I received on the device was a few revisions behind the last release and contained numerous bugs. The SPA-2102 is the current version of the adapter as of 10/2011.
5,Extreme Comedy!,"Make sure you don't need to use the bathroom before watching this show because you'll laugh so hard you may wet your pants! This is eye-watering funny! Drew Carey and the rest of the cast pull out all the stops here! I have vol. 1 and 2 from season 1 as well as the ""Best of"" DVD. Wonderful! Some mature content -- NOT for the kids."
2,vgboard,I found this whose line although funny and great was missleading on the material as it only had one disc with very little content for the price
5,BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!,"I had a great experience with this seller. Even though I had it sent to the wrong address and it was my fault, they refunded my money without even having received it back. VERY much appreciated. I ended up ordering it again."
2,Disappointed me,"Like reviewer Michael White before me, I found little insight into modern terrorism here and, although Conrad's writing style is always enjoyable, I found the story unsatisfying. The ""terrorists"" in this story are somewhat humorously portrayed as vain, self-absorbed toothless tigers and it's more a story about one man's personal crisis. I didn't much care for the ending and although I read somewhere about this novel having an amazingly suspenseful climax, I must have missed it because I found it predictable and even slightly boring. I've loved the other Conrads I've read, but cannot really recommend this one."
3,It's OK,"The hazards of following a reviewer's suggestions are compounded if you and the reviewer don't share similar tastes. So it was with my purchase of this book based upon an article about classic spy novels I read in the WSJ. It is true that Conrad's book is a classic and it is about a ""secret agent"", and I wasn't expecting a LeCarre or Fleming sort of read, but I found it plodding and somewhat dull. I was intrigued by the fact that English was not Conrad's first language and by how well he had assimilated the language and culture. I finished the book but it felt like an assignment for school."
5,Retreat-in-a-box,"I just organized my first youth retreat with this. I was nervous, but this book does it all for you. Great activities that really engaged the kids. Nice balance of fun and learning. Also, it gives you a shopping list for your supplies. The schedules are nice, since they give you the option for a full weekend or just an overnight. Topics are relevant, too."
4,India under the British Raj,"Kumar takes the reader back to the days of the British Raj in India, with a detailed study of Maharashtra. We see the structure of the Hindu society and the myriad castes and the intricate interminglings allowed [or disallowed]. There is also the interplay between this and the British administrators, who often introduced modern [ie. European] technological and scientific innovations.Thus we see how the university system was established, largely in conformance with British guidelines. More broadly, the economic ideas of Adam Smith and others were also brought into Indian society. Largely it seems that free enterprise met little ideological or religious resistance from the local population."
3,Softswitch kind of explained,"This book, sometimes gets it right and sometimes doesnt. The graphics are not great and they should be. Some of the tables employed are not significant enough to explain the points started. I think this book takes a small bite when it should be taking a large chunk out of explaining the subject matter."
5,This book pulls no analytical punches...,"This is the book that traditional switchmakers like AT&T, Nortel, Ericsson, Siemens and Alcatel and LECs like Verizon and QWest don't want you to read. Softswitch poses a highly disruptive threat to telecom monopolies. This book pulls no analytical punches in pointing out how the array of softswitch technologies (Class 4 and 5 replacement, IP Centrex, and IP-PBX) provide a lower barrier to entry to the service provider market and how this technology saves existing service providers in terms of OAM&P. If legacy telephone companies want to survive into the next decade, they must learn the lessons contained in this book."
4,"Pretty good movie, I hope more are made in series","I happened to catch the TV promotion for this before it aired and decided to watch partly because it had Billie Piper in it. I like British period detective dramas anyway and I wanted to see if she was good at something other than ""Rose Tyler"" from Dr. Who. I thought the story was pretty good, and the look of just about everything was wonderful- almost like being there.Unlike the first review and at least the first comment I believe Ms. Piper did a good job. I found very little to complain about in this movie, it was a bit rushed towards the finish- 96 minutes would've been better than 86- and I think Sally's photographer friend's work tent was much too light (not dark enough inside it), that's about it.If more are made in the series I'll watch and buy them."
2,Uh...where is the BBC version?,"I am sure that this is great but having seen the BBC version versus the PBS version, let me just say that the very critical scene of Fred proposing and her accepting is not in the PBS version. It isn't like you saw anything bad. But you did get to see Fred and Sally having a romantic moment, when she confesses that she didn't realize she is more with him than without. I refuse to buy this version."
2,Poorly made; skip this one.,"This is the first (of very many) Masterpiece Theater productions that I did not like at all. Too many confusing characters who are poorly developed and make brief, strange appearances; endless holes in the plot; overall, not very entertaining. Considering the dozens of other productions I have consistently enjoyed, this does not deserve the Masterpiece label."
2,Billie not convincing,"I watched this on PBS because I enjoyed Billie Piper's acting on Doctor Who and I'm also a fan of BBC mystery shows in general. My overall criticism is that Billie was miscast. She is very talented, but I believe her acting strengths come from her youthful energy and playfulness--her character in this show had neither. I didn't want to see Rose Tyler in a Victorian dress, mind you, but I did want to see her explore another character in depth. I think she fell flat. I really enjoyed the character of Axel, which was acted wonderfully by Jared Lewis, and that is what saved the show from being a one-star affair. I thought the ending was predictable and unlikely. I've only seen this one episode, but if the other 3 are like it then comparing this series to Nancy Drew is accurate. It would be acceptable as an introductory ""Mystery 101"" class for teenagers."
5,saw part on TV and had to have it,we saw part of this on TV and had to have it. Part of a series based on three books. Hoping they will do the third one soon
4,Ruby & Smoke,"My wife and I really enjoyed this DVD. The acting is great. The filming is well done too. However, there seemed to be a few disconnects in the story, but we liked it so much overall thst we plan to go back to see what we missed."
2,Really cute!,cute is really all I can say about this phone. it does not swing like it says it will. and a little break in the sound when it rings so its cute like I said but I dont think I will get another one.
4,Shunza's vocals are mesmerizing,"""Open Up"" is a two CD set that contains western Soul/R&B/Pop covers on one CD and originals on the other. I was in a Taipei pub last month when I heard the cover CD and it was a ""no brainer"" to go immediately buy it. The originals are quite good as well, though I haven't stopped listening to the cover CD long enough to allow the originals to ""grow"" on me."
1,james longstreet in the West by Hallock,Don't waste your time with this little book. It appears to be one of a series written by some pickup author without any subject matter knowledge. Mosr every page is taken up with a photo and biography of an officer the sole purpose of which is to take up space and eliminate the need for writing the text. The author also seems to have an agenda.
1,A monumentally obtuse thesis,"This book is not worth the paper it is written on. Nothing objective about the author's views of James Longstreet in her diatribe. She is obviously a victim of the gross distortions of the Lost Cause, the anti-Eastern bloc, and her own lack of qualifications to judge military figures. James Longstreet delivered the greatest victory in the west; I have to wonder why that is not considered in this completely inaccurate titled piece of garbage.Don't waste your time on this!"
1,Wrong on so many levels.,"This is by far the worst Civil War book I have ever read. Luckily it was a short read.I was so surprised how angry and vitriolic this author - Hallock seems to be over Longstreet. I mean really? No footnotes, no credible expertise to support some of the things this author alledges. How did a publisher agree to put this in print and publish it. If Hallock was a student of mine, and turned this in, it would get a D or even an F.Horrible book. Don't waste you time and money."
1,Quality is dubious,I ordered these because i was so pleased with an earlier set of Corelle textured leaves. They do enhance my kitchen and are durable. I have washed several times and they still look brand new. This set i just order though peeled pain and rusted almost immediately after just one washing. Not sure if it is different manufacturer but i definately see a difference.
1,inoperable,The product was delivered inoperable out of the container. It will not power up nor will the Colby people replace the item unless I pay postage both way for a replacement. To date it is unresolved and I am totally dissatisfied with the manufacturer/supplier.Archie Womble
2,"Is the Mormon my brother? Rather, is James R. White a Th.D.?","Mr. White has presented himself as a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.), but the granting institution lacked accreditation. My review is not of Mr. White's book; rather it is of Mr. White's self-aggrandizing claims. A doctorate is not necessary to write, mind you, but mind you as well that neither is high integrity, as Mr. White's claims demonstrate, to my mind at least. I labored hard and long for a Master's degree from an instituiton fully accredited by various boards. Roughly two-thirds of my fellow students never received their degrees."
2,"Inconsistency, Except In Its Relentless Hostility","This is a considerably better book than the usual anti-Mormon product. Of course, that's a little bit like being the loftiest peak in Kansas. The fundamental problem with Mr. White's argument is that, after laying out a fairly carefully crafted set of criteria for categorizing Mormon statements by levels of authority, he largely ignores his own criteria. A surprising number of his most ""damaging"" assertions rest either on his having read into his sources things that they do not clearly say or, more egregiously, on texts that don't measure up very well according to his own announced standards. He could have produced a rather useful evangelical statement. He didn't."
1,Let's educate ourselves,"Obviously, from the title of this book one can devise that it will tell us no truth. The correct name of the Church is The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We ARE Christians. Go to someone who can answer your questions correctly. Would you ask a predjudiced person to teach you about Mexicans? Of course not! You'd ask a Mexican. Don't waste your time on this book."
2,Loose arguments...further thought needed.,"White doesn't offer truely conherient arguments. He also, in much of his disscussion, violates the first rule of scholarly writing by refusing to properly define his terms...terms like ""brother"" and ""traditional christian"" don't seems to have reference to real world concepts.Much stronger works have been written on this important subject."
4,satisfied,"Liked the interview very much. It was like having Orson Welles in front of you when he was in his forties, still not too heavy and his voice vibrant. You could see he was being frank & honest."
2,Blah Progressive Trance,"Have to say that this is just interminable! The beat goes on, yes it does, over and over, ad naseum. Looking for vocals? Forget it, strictly beats. A few good mixes but lapses into boring passages which just seem to fill the time, all 74 minutes of it."
3,NICE CASE!,My daughter bought this with her own money. The carrying case is of very high quality. She said the ear 'buds' come out of her ears and are not comfortable. There is a draw string bag that holds everything else which is ok. Forget the screen protectors..they don't have any adhesive to keep them in place. If you are not holding the ds perfectly level they slide off. Pointless. You get this teeny case the size of your thumb that holds a cloth screen wipe..which works..but trying to cram it back into the pouch is impossible. Overall..I would buy the case separately..not the entire bundle pack.
5,Dana's Dream Gear,"This was a Christmas present for my Grandaughter and she really love's it.I ordered late in the holiday season, but still received it before Christmas. This seller is great!!!!"
5,very informative and enjoyable dvd,This dvd narrated by the late Richard Farnsworth would be a highly recommended addition to anyone's dvd collection who is interested in western americana/history.
4,"Nice R&B tune, will add it to the playist","Not an instant classic like Lately, but has a nice melody and will definitely be added to my playlist."
4,"Great graphics, good follow through","If Max represents the future of virtual pets, then it is a great start. Yes, all the parrot essentially does is parrot back your own wors in a more birdlike tone, but the graphics look beautiful and there is just something cool about telling this bird where to go."
4,Elina Fairy costume,"Loved the costume, it looked great on my daughter. Only downfall is the arm bands were to large for her arms."
2,Too much of the same thing,"Just about every song sounds like the last one, just a different genre version. I wish Ron would stick with one genre, such as bluegrass, rather than trying to run the gamut.This album sounds an awful like his first one."
3,SOBERING,"""As someone that was spellbound my the mystique of Yitzhak Rabin, I can guarantee you that THE RABIN FILE can be a very sobering book. As a resident of Jerusalem...I'm living with the consequences of his many blunders.""Daniel Ardel - Jerusalem"
4,Phantoms and muses,"In ancient times it was said that really inspired or creative individualshad ""muses'. Poets, artists and composers would have a female spiritthat would infuse the person with ideas.In this case the muse somehow gets caught between worldsand it takes the rescue of a failed muse from an untalentedheater repairman to bring her back to Martin.This story has a sort of old world Irish quality to it.It is well filmed and acted."
4,"Leila Pinheiro - ""Gold""","I first heard the voice of Leila Pinheiro on one of her live albums that she had recorded a few years ago. Since then, I have grown to enjoy listening to her music. In fact, since she is also known to play the piano in addition to singing, I have to be honest and admit that Leila Pinheiro is one of the reasons why I began to take piano lessons. If you are looking for a Brazilian Jazz singer, look no further -- Leila Pinheiro is a wonderful singer who can be classified under the current Brazilian Jazz scene. This CD is a wonderful album not only because you can get an idea of how nice Brazilian Jazz can be, but also because it shares some of Leila Pinheiro's biggest hits to date. If you buy this CD, you will enjoy every minute of it -- I know I have!!"
5,Very good,One of the best used books I've ever bought. I did not use it because I got my book back from the girl I lent it to just before the start of class but I sold it for a good price. Thank you.
2,product not as listed,product was listed as NEW and i assumed that meant w/out highlighting and with the CD - it was 20 bucks more than a book that was probably in better condition and i still have not received the CD.
2,Not a great toy,The quality of the toy is very cheap and has stickers on them but not the actual print. Not worth if you are paying full price for this toy
3,E For Effort,"I do recall hearing many of these stories as a child and the book triggered wonderful childhood memories. Coming from a Mexican family, these stories were presumed to be actual accounts and were a successful tool for parents to keep children in line.These accounts came to life when Grandpa whispered them to us on a warm, moonlit Summer night...as the kids huddled around him, clutching on to one another.I am grateful that the essence of the stories is preserved in writing. In all fairness to the author, something is lost during the transition from storyteller to the pages in a book. A good story teller has the unfair advantage of mannerisms, facial expressions and the opportunity to grab an unsuspecting, trembling youngster at the most chilling point of the story.To readers who did not grow up where these stories were an essential part of life, please do not judge these tales on the book alone, for they were meant to be heard, not read."
1,Cheap,"You get what you pay for. This shirt is so lightweight in material, you can actually see through it. Not worth it."
1,WRONG NAME,"This item it's not a counter it's a refractometer.Ther is not much to say about this, Thank youPlease correct"
5,Absolutely the best handbook for a pastor - ever !!,"I came across this book just after it was published and it transformed our life. We were in one of ""those"" churches and my wife was wondering why the folks were treating us as they were. After one very intense business meeting, my wife was in tears and ask again, ""Why do these folks hate us so?"" I recommended this book. She was in no shape to read it that night. In the morning when I got up, I could not find her anywhere in the house. Then I saw her on the carport, reading this book. The woman who was in tears the night before, walked into the kitchen and, with a smile, said, ""Now I understand.""In reading this book, do skip over the Introduction. Especially the last paragraph. Without saying it in so many words, the scenario in that paragraph sets the theme for the book."
4,Satisfied so far!,"Charger arrived on time, quick service. It was stated it was charger for L1-10B and L1-12B ( which is my battery) but on the package it stated for L1-10B battery - nothing about the L1-12B... I did use it and it seemed to work OK, but was not real comfortable with using it!"
2,A Mixed Bag,"Parts of this book are highly interesting, but others would have better been omitted. What I liked most about the book were the author's insights into the book that inspired her and her husband's journey - Steinbeck's Log from the Sea of Cortez. For anyone who shares a fascination with the Log from the Sea of Cortez, as I do, the author provides valuable background information on the book and the trip that inspired it. On the downside, the author seems fixated on trashing her brother-in-law, who piloted the boat her family used in attempting to re-create Steinbeck's journey. Obviously there was a personality conflict here, and her extended diatribes (which seemingly take up a full third of the book) seem mean-spirited and unwarranted. The book would have been vastly better if all of this material had been removed."
5,"Way out there, but great.","I remember getting this tape back in 1986. I had been a Steve Vai fan since the Zappa days, and wanted to check his solo stuff out. I love albums that are different, and you can say that Flexable is different, but in a good way. Songs like Little Green Men freak me out a little, but its also funny. Well my tape finally broke on me, so I had to replace it with a cd. All in all, a great album by Steve. A little out there, but hey, its Steve Vai, He is allowed that."
5,Can't Get Enough,"To start off with, Christine Townsend's books are fabulous. When I first read Passions Promise, I felt like part of the family. And when she came out with Love On Hold, I just fell in love with Cara and Jet all over again. I mean I loved these books so much that I re-read both of them and I don't usuallyread books twice. I can't wait to read Plenty More Love.I can't believe she's serious about ending the series. Please tell me she's just messing with us. I don't know about everyone else, but for me personally, I don't want to see them leave. I mean Cara and Jet need to become parents (Hint).Anyway, if you read these books you are in for a real reading experience. With Townsend's descriptions you feel like you're there.Jazzie E"
4,Very good table,"This table is excellent as it will provide a large prep area or table for 4 friendly people (6 if you use the ends in a pinch). It is rather bulky for mountain bike or back pack (light enough though); but will work fine with pack animals. It would be great if you have a bunch of folks and are car camping or even using the camper. Or just want to eat outside.The reason that I do not give it five stars is not that it takes a rubber mallet or medium sized gorilla to set up the first time. But, because there is no provision for uneven ground. An attachment for a leg that would allow a max of 4 to 6"" adjustment would be fine. It would be fairly easy to make an accessory attachment that would fit over 1 or 2 legs to provide leveling."
3,Too Small for My Liking,I love covered tea cups but I found these to be a bit too petite for my liking. I gave them to my sister who loved them! I prefer a big mug of tea personally. ;0)
5,love them,"I think these cups are pretty much perfect for hot tea. I drink rather slowly, especially if I'm doing anything else while drinking, so I usually dump out about half a cup of cold tea, but with these lids, I can get through the whole cup in my own sweet time and still have the tea be enjoyably warm. My girlfriend likes huge mugs for tea, but I don't like mine that watered down. This makes just the right amount for a full flavored cup.The cups are also quite attractive."
5,"Delicate to look at, but Sturdy","I now have six of these tea mugs. They are quite lovely with goldfish on the side, keep whatever beverage hot, and are very sturdy. The celadon green color is very pleasing."
3,Not liked by my rabbits,"A lot of wicker type bird toys are great for bunnies, but these are not. My rabbits did not chew or throw these around. Not sure how birds feel about them."
3,Good GTA3 giude,"Compared to the other PS2 Grand Theft Auto guides something is missing. Considering this is the first PS2 GTA guide and the only GTA3 strategy guide, you should buy it to get 100% completion."
4,Cool,"This did great on missions, but it didn't mention the cheat codes or anything like that. But hey, it saved my butt a few times"
2,"Good, but with important flaws","This rating does not have anything to do with the game quality. The game itself is the best game I have ever seen, but this stradegy guide does not hold up to the game's quality. This stradegy guide is good for advice on those missions you just can't beat, and the locations of the hidden packages. The problems (and the reason I gave it two stars) are with typos and bad maps. After all, an official stradegy guide should at least have some proofreaders. A connection between two of the islands contains an extra pasted copy of the bridge, giving the impression of two bridges, confusing to those getting to know the island. The third island's map, of the island that is hard to learn your way around, is pasted twice, which confuses greatly anyone trying to figure out the road system. The bottom line is that for the stradegy guige to be deemed official, it should at least be checked for errors."
4,is it worth it? maybe. maybe not.,"Grand Theft Auto 3 is a fun game to play. It's not as great as Vice City, but it is still one of the better games out there. But, unlike Vice City, which I enjoyed reading about, GTA3 isn't as much fun to read about. The missions are fairly simple, and there are multiple ways to complete them, so the guide isn't the end all be all that it is in games like Metal Gear. You do get good desriptions of weapons and vehicles. And what I find most valuable are the maps to the hidden treasures, rampages, bribes, armor, life, etc. If you are having trouble completeing the game because you can't find all your hidden treasures and rampages, then this guide will solve your problems."
2,barebones at best,"Its your typical Brady Games guide and thats says alot as they do not seem to understand the people who buy players guides.It has tips for all the missions and locations for the hidden packages and that is it.pros: whats there is well done, Style wise fits in very well with the manual that comes with the game.cons: feels imcomplete, much more useful data could be added, lacks guide for the rampages, the map given for Rampages, weapons and etc could be done better.lacks cheat codes and information on some side missionsworth the price i paid for a used copy but not worth the price for a new copy."
4,Great Item,"This is a great strategy guide! It is very complete, has all the maps for the city and the places where you can find all the cool stuff! It also leaves some things to your imagination since it is spoil free.Buy it and enjoy GTA3 at its fullest!!!"
2,Not worth it,Whether the book tells you exactly how to do a mission or not you'll still end up failing it a few times before you actually complete it. Most of what is written in this book is a no brainer and easy to figure out. The only good I see from the book are possibly different routes or secrets here and there but even those you can get online for free so there is no point wasting the money.
3,Good for the UNIX Novice,"Decent reference - at least pointing out some interesting options and some things to watch out for at the OS level. As mentioned in other reviews - its HP-UX oriented with nearly as much focus on AIX, but lacks detail on Solaris (and Linux).Fairly well written - but mainly pretty simple content. Just keeps you from looking up the syntax in some cases. If you are new to UNIX its probably worth the purchase. If you are an experienced UNIX professional - find it used to make it a worth-while purchase."
4,Very handy,"The common UNIX tasks a DBA does. Covers common UNIX versions. Does not cover the extensive scripting required for some tasks. But then, it wasn't intended to."
1,"It Support SUN SOLARIS, but leaves LINUX in the cold!!!","This book is keen on Sun Solaris, but it leave Linux in the cold. How many Oracle students are buying Sun Solaris boxes? Probably a lot less than you think. Let's face it, students want a Linux box because it's practically FREE and it's the future. Maybe I should write a book for us Linux users....we like free operating systems. Who can blame us?"
2,Not for scholars,"As a graduate student specializing in religion I found this book wanting. If you're looking for a ""soft"" approach to finding spirituality in popular culture, then this book may be for you. Despite the autho'rs credentials this minimally researched book acts more as a stepping stone to creative thinking about identifying basic Buddhist concepts in fantasy writing than a serious attempt at scholarly inquiry. Often the connections are weak, but I commend Roy for his attempt because the field definitely needs more books that attend to Buddhist themes in popular culture. Instead, I would refer readers to the ""Philosophy and XX"" series that looks at specific movies/books such as The Matrix, The Lord of the Ring trilogy or The Simpsons."
4,Works well,"I got the Smart AC as a gift. We used it in the car to plug in the children's Nintendo DS's when they run out of juice. It works very well for that purpose and we haven't had any issues. There's a little fan inside, but with all the car noise, I don't notice the sound of the fan.I also ownWagan EL2295 210W Smart AC Power Inverter. It isn't always an advantage to have two outlets as they are arranged on the 210W, because they are both right next to each other and the plugs sometimes don't fit. We used both inverters in the minivan on our last trip (one in the front cigarette plug and one in the back cigarette plug). It wasn't a problem to have both plugged in and in use at the same time."
3,Part timers only,"While this might thrill the ""new age"" practitioner - and considering I've seen martial approaches interpret forms/routine differently and remain martially viable - this is definitely not as the creator intended by the look of it. Seek out the work of GM Chen Xiaowang... or even another variant of short modern routine by GM Chen Zhenglei... if you are serious about practicing Chen style Taijiquan but wish for a shorter routine than the traditional Old Frame First Routine (the 38 is derived from it)."
5,Very Funny,"Benny Hill combines all of the great comedy bits of Charlie Chaplin, Jack Benny and WC Fields rolled into one. There will never be another like him. Even in 2013 my teenage son laughs at his antics."
4,Some great visuals,"Though not really an entertaining film, Crystal Voyager is definitely one for true fans of film to see. The documentary/story is not completely boring, but it really doesn't go much further than ""I base my life upon surfing."" What the film has are a bunch of very intriguing shots of waves: from afar, close-up, inside, and underneath. The added bonus of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"" over the end of the film is just that: an added bonus to a neat film."
5,FANTASTIC!,"The voice of Grace/Dominique Atkins is angelic and anthemic. I love it. The 12"" mix is even better than the radio edit, it's also a little harder. 'I Dream' is a remix from 1995, and it's very good. GET THESE TWO CD's if you like English Trance from the best!!"
1,"Sony, too hard to fix.","I am a computer repair tech who has a client that uses these for their road warriors. If these things work they are fine but fixing them is impossible. Odd track pad and shutdown issues plague them. All the hard disks have failed by the 2 year mark. The camera gives one fits getting the right drivers loaded. The Sony driver download site is slow and confusing and Sony no longer sells the original install disks. These things are just too proprietary for me. Most of my DELL tricks just do not work on these Sonys. If you can afford to throw it away if it breaks out of warranty go ahead, buy it."
3,aint that compatible with vista,the laptop is fairly fine. in Vista customer rating experience this laptop didn't exceed 3.3i bought vista business - as it is recommended for my laptop - from amazon.took lots of trial and error to upgrade because of the lack of compatibility drivers from sony. finally i installed it . with some diffeciency.my safe folder no longer work .i can not open the camera from windows .. i must be in chat room to enable view it else i cant - not like xp .LOTS and LOTS of freezing since i installed vistasometime vista runs slow if i opened multiple IE pages.automatic notifications from sony no longer works
3,3 major cons,"1)battery is too bulky and heavy, reduce the great portability and the beauty of this nicely crafted small laptop.2)bundled with too many useless sony vaio typical junk and garbage3)funny and spongy keyboard, fast typing either hung or jumped around and randomly inserted into any typed word, sentence and lines make the typing a very stressful torture. sony so far has not solved or improved this keyboard problem. the keyboard typing drawback is just like a high fashioned beautiful young woman wearing broken 4 inches high heels shoes. this is the major turn-off and downside that has force me to swear never buy sony vaio laptops again (twicely bitten, a lesson learned too bitterly). sony should approach ibm/lenovo to learn how to improve its funny keyboard. hey, sony, we are buying a computer to do lot of works, we are not buying a dvd player, you hear??other than these 3 cons, this is one of the most beautiful notebooks."
1,Extremely hot laptop!,"This laptop gets extremely hot - ""will burn you"" type of hot. Keyboard is super cheap and fan is super noisy. Loved the size and loved that computer was sturdy but the heat that this laptop emits is dangerous - this model should have been recalled. Barely used the wireless on and off button and it broke. No complaints regarding it's internal performance. Unless they are selling this model for $200 or less - look else where. If you purchase one you should also purchase a cooling pad. I suggest you connect them with velcro (as I have done)as you won't be able to use your computer without it - sort of defeats the portable aspect of a laptop though."
3,"Only one and major drawback,","Performance and looks wise its best laptop in market, very crisp clear screen that make your photos and videos live , it's very light weight which defines exactly true meaning of LAP TOP the only major draw back is battery power its last only 2 hrs very that,s disappointing."
1,Don't buy this one,"I had another Sony VAIO for 8 years and never had a problem. This one arrived and seemed to be fine, but when I tried to use Outlook I started getting funny error messages. I called support and was diagnosed with a corrupted hard drive. I debated then whether to return it, but since I'd had such a good experience with Sony before... I sent it in. Didn't get it back for 28 days (normal is 7-10 days). They had to replace the motherboard, a fact my repairs slip did not record-- I found that out talking to a Sony tech when I was hunting it down. All in all a bad experience, the only good thing about this was Amazon, which gave me a refund."
5,UK's best kept secret,"exit ten's first cd ""This world They'll Drown"" is a remarkable blend of beautiful melodies, powerful musicienship and great song writing. These guys plain and simple make beautiful music. They can be soft or heavy, but always strong.recomended for people who are into modern metal, leaning more to the melodic side (think In flames meets tool, meets karnivool). Just AWESOME."
3,What year is this book for 2001 or 2002,"I would be nice to know if this book is for preparation of 2001 or 2002 taxes. Since I (nor countless others) do not know, I will buy it locally. Sorry!!!!"
2,okay but not great.,"A waitress is attacked after discovering the dancers at a strip club are vampires. Her friend and a pizza delivery man eventually figure out what's going on and along with two FBI agents set out to rescue their friend and destroy the horny blood suckers.The women is this film are pleasing to the eye and there are some humorous scenes here and there but overall this is not a very good film. The acting is pretty bad, though the guy playing the pizza guy wasn't to shabby. But for the most part the movie is fairly boring with few scary or suspenseful moments."
1,Warning watch trailer before wasting your time.,"So I love strippers and I love vampires so I put this movie on my wish list and almost add it to my cart until I saw the preview. Gee that was close! all I have to say is why? I hate it when they kill strippers and vampires coolness and mojo like that. Is a ""check your brain at the door movie"":-)"
2,item not as pictured,"The coffee mug I received did not match the picture. Since I was trying to replace one of a set that had been damaged, the appearance of the cup was important. The cup was white inside and not yellow. Also, the cup was narrower that a ""tankard"" description would suggest. Good sturdy cup, just not what I wanted."
4,Interesting,"Like a previous reviewer, I was put off by the concentration on ancient history with almost no modern history.Having said that, the ancient history IS fascinating and I am very hald I read the book.To the two turkish reviewers: when your country finally admits that it massacred the Greeks at Smyrna and the Armenians at every opportunity, then people will begin to forget, but as long as you insist that these things didn't happen people will assume that that is still the way it is in Turkey."
2,Too brief on modern Turkey,"There's too much - more than 60% of the book - devoted to the pre-Ottoman period. There's too much emphasis on ancient Turkey. To understand modern Turkey, it is essential to understand the Ottoman and the Attaturk legacies. Only about 30 pages are devoted to the Attaturk and post-Attaturk period. It is just not possible to understand the role of Islam, the military, the position of women, etc., in modern Turkey, without in-depth reference to the impact of the Ottomans and Attaturk to attitudes and values in the country."
4,Perspectives on Papa,"Not having read any Cuban fiction, I gave this a try.It took me in, not only to Cuban life (for which I craved more description) but to the Hemingway portrait. It's been years since I've read a Hemingway novel or a bio. (although I read one on Hadley last year that was very kind to him). The portrait that is presented (through a clever weaving of past and present) is plausible to the mystery and to the man himself.Credit must be given to the translator, as well as a very creative author. Like a previous Amazon reviewer, I'd like to read more of this author."
4,Adios Hemingway,"Quite an enjoyable read! The atmosphere of Cuba during the 50's before the revolution and at the start of Hemingway's decline make this novel a treat. The author's writing captures Hemingway's style with short declarative sentences emphasizing what's not actually written and allowing the reader to fill-in the blanks. A wonderful police procedural similar to Andrea Camilleri's Montalbano series and Garcia-Roza's Inspector Espinosa mysteries. The novel does such an excellent job of bringing Hemingway's time in Cuba to life, I feel that I've actually seen Ava Gardner's black-lace panties. Read the book!"
5,A delightful surprise!,"I had no expectations for this book. I was taking a chance, having an interest in Cuba and mysteries. The book is very engaging; it grabbed me from the first page, and my interest and appreciation increased with every page. Now I am anxious to read more by Padura Fuentes. It is a good story, very well told. Padura Fuentes is an exceptionally talented writer, and the English translation, in my view, is excellent. Contrary to other reviews, I don't think you have to be a Hemingway fan to appreciate this; I'm not. But I did learn a lot that was interesting about Hemingway. Both he and Conde, the fictional detective at the heart of this story, are complicated characters, with lots of faults but some admirable qualities."
3,Nova Bugs,Entertaining and factual and I wish amazon would stop bugging me to do reviews. This video is more fun than Amazon.
3,Careful with small dogs,"My wife and I purchased this harness to help us train our dog how to walk properly in an extremely crowded city. While the harness itself does a decent job of providing more stability with our dog, there are two main problems that we have with it: one is that it is continuous rubbing against his chest, and has caused a lot of iritation there. The second is that he seems to be able to slip one leg out of the harness fairly regularly, no matter how tight we make it.I would recommend the harness, but be aware of these two factors. It can be a great tool to help you teach your dog to walk nicely, as long as you are willing to put in the time."
1,how the hell do u work this thing,ok i have no clue how to work the yhing do u have to have 2 ac adapters to plug into the amp and then into guitar please help and does it include the pedel because mine didnt come with it
4,A philosopher's explanation of how angels must exist!,"Prolific philosopher Mortimer Adler takes on a subject few philosophers dare to tackle. Can it be proven by reason alone that angels actually exist? Adler does an excellent job of evaluating the history of religious and philosophical thought about angels. He leads the reader through reasons by which a belief in angels makes sense! The scholarly approach may be difficult reading for some, but the fascinating subject and his reasoning are worth the effort"
2,disappointed,"As a long time fan of Dougie MacLean, I was disappointed in INSIDE THE THUNDER. Every song sounded exactly the same to me."
3,critical care secrets,"Critical Care SecretsI am a critical care pharmacist and bought this to see if anything useful for reference, teaching. I didn't see anything that was beyond a typical textbook approach...but then I didn't keep the book because the print was too small (not as small as Sanford's guide) but too much trouble to try to read. I think the ICU book by Marino has more pearls and is easy to read."
1,Another dead game from WotC,"The original War at Sea seemed like a fun offshoot of the epic Axis & Allies franchise. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast has fired the lead designer and many of the others associated with this product. The game is now dead. Fortunately, it wasn't all that great to begin with as the miniatures were often incorrectly sculpted and scaled and the gameplay was downright elementary. The strongest units were fantasy that never even fought in the war and iconic ships that actually fought were never made. Even if you can overlook all of that, the minis themselves were plagued by quality issues, including bent boats, missing turrets, and horrific paint jobs."
4,avid reader's entertaining quick read,This story moves well and is very entertaining. It was romantic and contained a attractive leading man. What more could you ask!
2,Not so good,"This was a fairly light, quick read, about a young woman who ends up crewing a ship that is owned by a drug runner. When the crew is arrested oversees, she is implicated, however the local Sheikh who finds her attractive decides to test her.Like most Harlequin manga, Traded to the Sheikh is pretty badly abridged. So, most of the story is cut out. While there was nothing wrong with this story, neither did it really have much detail. The hero was nice and decent, he tried to help the heroine, and the heroine offers herself to him as his bedmate, which leads to him thinking she isn't interested. The romance is nearly non-existant as these two like eachother from the start, and there really isn't much to their lovestory beyond him helping find her family.I felt the art was subpar in this book. The faces are childishly drawn, and compared to other HQ manga looked a bit amateurish. I've read better, and while it wasn't awful it wasn't all that great either."
2,Good Start,"It was a good effort and closely resembles the efforts of Hazlewood, Ressler and Douglas but with 1940's principles. Much of what was considered deviant is now acceptable today. I must say though that many of the criminals wrote about in this book were executed or jailed, unlike the criminals of today. Justice was swift back in 1940! This book is a quick read due to most of it being q & a with the psychologist. The book would be better if it were more up to date."
4,Most exempllary collection of REAL country music,"Although listeners under the age of 35 are convinced that today's Nashville overproduced and hypermarketed product is genuine country, this cd is a nifty little collection of the hard-core, no-frills, roots that country grew from. While some names are more known in the Tennessee, Kentucky, cradle-of-the-sound area, the country enthusiast can get a glimpse of the sounds that germinated on the tube-radios of the foot-hills and culminated on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry."
4,Where Is The Collector?,"The first season of THE ALL NEW SUPER FRIENDS originally had 8 one hour episodes. This 2-Disc collection only has 7 one hour episodes. It seems the 8th episode which, had the following four shorts, was deleted to make way for the Special Features:The CollectorHandicapThe Mind MaidensAlaska PerilLet's hope when the second season comes out it includes the missing 8th episode from season one."
4,It's like Time Travel,"Bought this for my 5 year old son who's really into superheroes. He loves it, and it's pretty funny to see the differences in how cartoons approached their audience then. I plan to buy more of these releases."
5,Review for Super Friends DVD,"The All-New Super Friends Hour: Season One, Vol. 1 is great entertainment. Brings me back to my childhood days and makes me appreciate how they made cartoons in those days compared to today. A must have for Superhero collectors."
5,classic fun,"Fast shipping, great product for a great price. Love the classics without all the TV commerical breaks.Thanks for the childhood memories."
4,A Blast From the Past,"The All-New Superfriends Hour: Season One, Vol. 1It was really good! The format is like the original saturday morning show. You get one shorter story with one or two superfiends then a wondertwins episode, a full superfriends episode like the ""Plant Creatures"" or "" When Worlds Collide"" and then a two superfiend episode often with a special guest star like ""The Atom"". It is a great walk down memory lane!"
4,another good set,"Greetings, the only reason I didn't give this one 5 of 5 is because WB could have easily packaged the whole series together as a 4-disc set. Oh well. Anyway, hoepfully by the end of 2008 we will see almost all the SF series on DVD. (part 2 of this set from 1977, the 1st season in 1973, & Wolrds Greatest from 1979)My only worry is that so far there has not been *ANY* incling of when/how the 66 ""short"" epsiodes that aired from 1980-1983 will be released. The opening sequence has not even been seen since thir original broadcast, and I'm just fearful it may have been lost when these were cut-up with several other SF & Filmation DC series to make ""The Batman Superman Adventures"" in the mid-90's. I love seeing these on Boomerang & several on-line sites, but I really want to see the original opening & title cards again...."
1,Does not fit Honda CRV 2003,"Do not by this if you want the kit for honda crv 2003. i tried it. it does not fit. no screws for fitting the stereo. no screws for fitting to the car, no instructions."
4,"Fits 2004 Odyssey, but difficult not to break...","After 4 different dash kits, this one actually fits! The only problem is that the plastic tabs you have to break off aren't easy to do so, even after cutting them. I've been installing car stereos for some time, and I've never had the trouble I had with this one. Be very careful when you're breaking the tabs off on the side piece that secures into the dash. One of them broke clean through and I now have a small gap along the top of the bracket between the dash and the front of the stereo.***It's not visible when the dash is put back on, and the stereo is still secure!***It's just worth mentioning that the tabs that you are supposed to break off aren't going to be easy to break off."
1,"Horrible kit, awful fit.","This is an awful kit, if you follow the instructions it does not stay in place. I'm glad it only cost a few dollars since I ended tossing it in the trash. If you do get it to stay in place and you use mount the radio with the sleeve that comes from the radio's manufacturer the radio sticks out and looks terrible. I ended up buying the oem Honda radio / pocket assembly off ebay and will try to use the factory mounts instead to mount the radio."
4,I think the 99-7898 works pretty well with my 92 Integra,"After I bought the parts and read the reviews I was a bit worried. My concern was ""how can this thing holds my new stereo and where's the support for the new stereo"". The instruction indeed is too simple and some of the marking on the main unit (which ones to remove for certain cars) are missing. Especially the markings for the ones to keep for my 92 Integra are missing. Having said all that, installation is quite easy although removing the 2 screws on the back for the original stereo was a bit difficult. I attached the metal casing from the new stereo to the kit first. I bent the necessary metals to secure the metal casing. Also, find the right piece to attach to the back of the install kit (with 2 screws) which will support the new stereo. Then, insert this install kit. It fits pretty well and solid. Finally, insert the new stereo. All in all, it works pretty well for me."
1,Radio Install Kit for 2000 Prelude,The instructions were not helpful for my 2000 Prelude. I had to buy another kit from another manufacturer and figure out how to make those parts work for my vehicle. It appears neither manufacturer provided sufficient instructions on this product for the Prelude. The fit of this product (and the other one I bought) in the console opening could be tighter.
2,"Nice history book but, not a buyer's guide.","This book is a good overview of VW models and should provide an adequate starting point for those just bitten by the VW bug. Most VW fanatics, however, should know everything here. As for a buying guide, this book is not helpful as it doesn't go into detail on features available by model year and doesn't include a summary of potential problems to look out for when in the market for a used VW."
3,FUN with Devil DUCKS!!!,"OK as far as novelty goes these ducks are SOOOO funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky!!! I bought them for my 1 year old just because I am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky.Anyone who feels this lil duck TOY is devil worship to has some serious issues, and I would suggest they need to seek some professional help.So for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because I think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight.."
3,"Cute, but small","The title sums it up - these are cute and somewhat amusing (the humor was lost on some though), but they are only about 2"" each - kind of small. Of course they are plainly labeled as such, so there is no fault here, but I would like to see them offered in a larger size."
2,bad drawing book,"This book is poorly put together. It looked as if it had been copied and it was even double copied on some pages. It also had no cover or colored pages. Figures are small proportions, not up to date with fashion figures. It was a bunch of copied pages"
1,I'm glad I got it for a penny...,This book is a children's book. His brief and shallow answers wouldn't satisfy anyone over the age of 12.
3,"In response to the so-called ""lifelong Mormon""",Just a word of caution to people reading these reviews- the person who wrote claiming to be a lifelong Mormon and stating that Mormons believe that God (Elohim? Never heard Heavenly Father referred to in those terms anywhere) had physical sex to conceive Jesus and that He has multiple wives is lying. The Mormons do believe in a Mother in Heaven (not Mary). What this person who claims to be LDS is stating is a gross misrepresentation of the LDS faith. Perhaps they should do more research than just watching The God Makers in their anti-Mormon church meetings...
2,Fountain work good BUT the hose BLOW out after 3 weeks,"Amazon ship fast, good service, hook it up, run for 3 week and connection hose to the fountain BLOW out. Return to amazon with good service again, hope this time it will last longer???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
4,Pleased with fountain,"We bought this for our son for his birthday and he really enjoys it. I'm not the best handiman, but it wasn't too hard to install at all. My one complaint is that the plastic clamps that hold the hose to the fountain and jet nozzle broke pretty quickly. But $3 at Home Depot fixed that with aluminum clamps. The other added value of this product is the nice splashing sound it makes as the drops of water hit the pool surface. Make it sound like it's raining all the time!"
1,Splash Pools 30730 Floating Grecian Pool Fountain,"Received unit fast. Problem was the fountain head had a broken small pipe inside the head which directed some of the water up through the center hole. Had another fountain head from another old unit, which I used to replace the broken one."
1,"Bad,bad,bad","This product is horrible does not come with multiple attachments to accommodate any pool size. I am very , very displeased with this product!!! Waste of $$$"
1,The hose is difficult to connect.,"I struggled for hours trying to connect the hose to the elbow piece and the fountain head. The hose was simply too tight and too deformed. If only the pipe tips were tapered a bit more! Did I miss something obvious? The instruction booklet was no help. Worse, there was no contact information whatsoever on either the instruction or the box."
2,Only Eye Candy with no substance.,"With my first browse, it appeared this book would be a worthy addition, but once I got into the meat of the book I found it had very little worth except for a few inspirational moments. The title leads you to believe it is about the web. Actually about have of it is. The other half is on CD design and packaging. Most of these designs would be way to graphic intensive for a smart web page. Also there is no info on how these designs were actually accomplished. No case histories. Only skin deep reviews about the project. For me, it would be unwise to spend the [money] on this publication. This is truly only eye-candy."
1,Outdated,"This book is useful for one thing... an interesting historical perspective on the web.Published in 1998 (thus written in 1997) this is a a 7-year old book. MUCH has changed since that time, and leaving this in print without a new edition is disgraceful on the part of both the authors and publisher.I guarantee that 90% of the websites they use as examples have completley changed their interface and design since this book.In fact, many of the examples they show are hopelessly confused and chaotic front pages, that may have worked as a novelty back in the day, but will not have staying power with modern-day web surfers.They are dozens of new and much better books on the market for the moeny... ""Home Page Usability"" and the incredible ""Design of Site""s are two of my favorites."
5,Great Inspiration,"As a web designer I have found this book to be most inspirational. While I do not agree that all of the sites that he lists in the book are designed well, it does provide many examples of various types of web sites with beautiful pictures and site layouts."
5,"Finally, a web design book with great examples!","My two cents: As a graphic design educator, I am very pleased to finally find a book with an emphasis on project planning, good interface design principles and high quality printed color examples (screen shots). I have specified this as a textbook for a web design course for graphic design majors."
1,A Total Waste of Hard-Earned Money!!!,"This book shows some lovely examples of web design. However, Do they Work?? Not to mention, their website for this book offers More information on More websites that you can actually SEE working!! I regret ever spending my money on this!"
4,book was ok not what I expected.,The book was not that great source it was ok but the condition of the book was excellent. Thanks
5,WOW! is right!,"Wow is right! Vibrant, colorful, and packaged with an excellent Macintosh/Windows companion CD, this book is designed for experienced or novice web techies. Rather than covering principles of HTML, Javascript, or other programming languages, reading this book will help you think like a designer, offering methods of developing an elegant interface and style to best suit the goals you have set for your web project. Multiple screenshots of spectacular web pages help illustrate their insightful points. Descriptions of how the process of how certain pages were created offer ideas for your own projects. The CD contains fully licensed versions of Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer, shareware web devlopment tools, demos of several WYSIWYG and raw HTML editors, and more. My only compalaint is also my biggest compliment. The richly colorful design can be a bit overwhelming on the eyes after long periods of reading."
5,The Everything Poodle Book,"This is an excellent basic manual for poodle owners. Lots of good, common-sense advice and recommendations. I have bought many copies of this book -- when I bred a litter, it was part of the ""puppy package"" that went to each new owner. I've also given it to people who have opened their homes to rescue poodles. All found it interesting and useful."
5,marvelous!!,this book is excellent..especially catherine hart's other books too...ie. impulsive..her newest book
3,all right,"This Native American novel has a bit of a unique twist to it, and is definitely better than any of the Cassie Edwards novel I ever read. I still did find the writing hinky in some spots, but I can tell the author did try to make the story unique.However, I found Silver Thorn's power to be exaggerated, along with Nikki's quick acceptance of the fact that she is now his mate even though she was unwillingly impregnated by him. I also found the ending to be all too cliche. This book is all right for a read on the beach or a long trip, but don't expect a great work of literature here."
2,Wrong content,"The CD was suppose to contain a documentary of issues involving young men and their struggles, as well as the counsel of older mentor; in a mentoring fashion.This CD contain just the opposite, the content, though label ""Men to Boys"" was actually another documentary base on women ""We need to talk"".Though ""We need to Talk"" appears to be a very good documentary as well, it's not what I ordered. When I reported the mistake I was advised the CD I wanted was not available and could keep the wrong CD and receive a reduced price or return it for refund.Wrong and inconvenient!"
1,Fly Away to Dragon Land (Dragon Tales),My daughter and I were very disappointed with this book. She likes Dragon Tales so I thought she'd like a book. The show has a story where one of the characters learns a lesson but this book isn't even a story and it didn't hold her interest. The flaps did not add much to the overall book. Very Disappointing.
2,Rabbit Heart,"I found this novel to be grossly disappointing. The main character Nicollette was on an emotional rollercoaster the entire story, mourning the loss of the men she slept with but not hastening to sleep with others. Her character was unbelievably selfish and only began to feel guilty when being apprehended for her crimes. The outcome of the story can basically be assumed by the stories beginning. I only forced myself to read this novel after paying full price for the text and it would have been nice to know this story was amateur soft porn with a French twist. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read a book with substance, dimensional characters and has a love scene that doesn't make you want to role your eyes in annoyance. I hope this was helpful."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard several Robbie Fulks songs over at a friends house and really liked his stuff. So, I went down to the CD shop and they had one Fulks CD, this one; so I bought it and eagerly popped it in as soon as I got into the car. My first thought, ""is this the right CD?"" While the Robbie Fulks I'd heard was raw, old-timey, swingin', honky-tonky and mostly upbeat...what I was hearing something much more ""pop"" and radio friendly. Not what I was expecting, to say the least. I've tried to get through the whole album, but I just can't. To me, this CD sounds like all the other boring, over-produced, ""pop"" radio country songs you hear on the radio...which to me, is hardly country anyway. I'm really disappointed.I'll be selling this one back and getting one of his earlier CDs. If you like ""pop"" country, perhaps you'll like this...Personally, I just can't find anything interesting in this album. It's not horrible, just boring and uninspired."
4,Great Stretching!,Love the stretching. The stretching in this video doesn't feel like a chore. The time passes quickly. He shows great modifications as well.
1,Exploiting women's fears for her profit,"Ms. Savage thinks that by throwing in the word ""emotion"" women will think this book ""talks to them."" This is a calculated attempt to profit from women's fears about money. Even Oprah did NOT buy it! Better books were written by Jane Bryant Quinn and Peter Lynch."
1,Old News,"This book is nothing buy repackaged material from many other (and better) books.Two vastly superior books are: ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias.""Making the Most of Your Money,"" by Jane Bryant Quinn.The Savage Truth is: If you're going to buy a book from a repeat author stick with Quinn or Tobias."
1,Paid Flack For Microsoft,"Ms. Savage purports to be a journalist and objective financial planner. Yet if you read her book or see her show, where she blatantly and unrelentingly plugs Microsoft products, you would never know that she is on Microsoft's payroll. Come on Terry, if you're going to line your pockets with corporate money, why don't you have the courage to disclose the names of your benefactors and why you're plugging their products?"
1,Unoriginal,"There's nothing new in this book. In fact, several reviews commented that she is just restating what she wrote years ago in her prior books. The savage truth is that Ms. Savage is acting as a mouthpiece for Microsoft by touting Microsoft products in almost every chapter. It's probably no coincidence that she works for, you guessed it, Microsoft."
1,Contains Many Tax Errors,I am a tax attorney and was disappointed to find that this book contained so many errors. Some were serious enough that you would lose if you were audited by the IRS. Ms. Savage should stick to subjects she knows and not give false financial information.
4,One of the better magic beginner books,"Tom Ogden does a good job of introducing absolute beginners to the art of conjuring. As well theoretical background as practical tricks are included.You can surmise from his tips and comments that Mr. Ogden has worked the field and knows what will work and what will not.No hard Sleight-of-Hand, but it isn't avoided either.Erik (Lord-Anacho) Arfeuille, Belgium"
3,breaking it down,"The title track from Vol. 2-Release is a fantastic song. When I saw 10 versions of it on one CD for the price listed above, I thought it sounded like a bargain, as well as something fun to listen to.If you want something more danceable than the original Release track, there are a couple of drum and bass intensive things here for you. There is also a Reggae-ish mix, as well as a couple of instrumental tracks with the vocals mixed right the heck out of there. The Keyapella is sort of the inverse, vocals only with very minamalist insturmentation.This CD was almost like a study of Release, dissecting it and looking at the individual elements. It is impressive, in a way. It helped me to appreciate that ""Release"" is not just a lucky shot. It is an expertly assembled piece with very beautiful components. But there was nothing on this CD that made me sit up and say ""Now that's an improvement to the original.""Perhaps it was unreasonable for me to hope for that."
2,Overpriced and overweight,"I bought this bike for my three and a half year old son, as he was outgrowing his 12"" bicycle. I should have physically examined it before buying it.The bike is *heavy* which makes it hard to peddle. It comes with the flimsiest training wheels I've ever seen--just plastic disks. I had to buy some aftermarket training wheels to make it rideable. It also came with a useless front brake (the pads didn't even touch the rim) which I just removed, and lots of plastic pieces which were dragging on the chain.For $110, I was hoping this would be a better bike than a standard 16"" child's bike. It isn't. Either save your money and buy a cheaper bike, or spend another $70 to get a truly better bike by a company like Specialized."
1,this is not a piano book,"First off, this book was not written for piano, which is obvious because they forgot to edit out various instances of the word ""guitar"". Another horibble aspect of this book, there is not one explanation of chord voicings... it strictly speaks about 2 bar or less licks. I was thinking, this is ok, at least there is a play along cd that cycles through the keys. But it is not how they notated it, which is supposed to be in common time, but is in 3/4. The chord changes are extremely ambiguous, the only way I could tell this was by counting (about 4 times to make sure). Of course, the rest of the play alongs could be different, but I am going to throw this book in the trash can before I find out. What a joke, and a scam...it isn't even for piano. If all you want to learn is a few scales and what the ""upper structure"" of a chord is, this book is still horrible."
1,What the....?,This book SUCKED!!! I don't know what Claremont and Lucas were thinking! I should have realized this when I read Star Wars by George!! That book sucked too!! The Movie was great but the book was an abortion just like this one. I can't even believe they wrote a second one in this dreadful series. They should have had Wayland Drew (who wrote Willow) write this one!!!
2,george lucas does not equal gold,"Star wars, indiana jones and, this? my only explanation is that george lucas only provided the ideas for this story and had no part in the actual novel. As i've indicated, shadow moon starts out well, with familiar characters from the willow movie, and goes down hill FAST. Chris claremont, who is on top of his game in the X-men comic books, made a terrible mistake jumping into fantasy novels. This is the first book in a long time that has truly been a chore to read. Weak characters, anticlimactic battles, and a truly pathetic supporting cast ( two words; Brownies suck!) are just a few of the flaws. If there were parts of the book that were good, I could say it was an unpolished gem, but as it is, the gem isn't only unpolished, but still embedded in a giant chunk of earth."
1,This book is absolutely lousy,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It drags on and on (I read the whole thing) and there was nothing to like about it. The characters run from disaster to disaster, the descriptions always belaboring how close to collapse the characters are and yet they miraculously defeat another crisis without even a minutes rest. It made my eyes hurt to read it, and my brain hurt, too."
2,A big disappointment,"I'm a well-read person with a lot of fantasy books under my belt and I think I can fairly say that this one is not very well written. The premise is intrigueing and the settings are captivating, but there isn't enough variation in the perspectives of the primary characters to have any kind of plot tension show up. Also, the book is too long. I suspect it was intended for publication as a pentology then squashed into a trilogy as the climax occurs about 2/3 of the way through the book. I did make it all the way to the end of this one, but couldn't stand the thought of two more books like this."
2,"If you loved ""Willow"", You'll Hate This Book","Did you love ""Willow"" because it was fast-paced, funny, tongue-in-cheek, had folks with good values and a happy ending? Well you'll hate this book which is tedious, self-important, humourless, full of folks with bad values, disgustingly violent and not only is the ending not happy - it isn't even an ending!"
1,Stay away,"This book made me wonder if the George Lucas and Chris Claremont that wrote it are the same two men that I know. This story was horrid and you shouldn't bother reading it. The writing was really bad, and the characters were one-sided. The simple fact that Madmartigan and Sorsha died before the main story started made me almost put the book down, but no I continued on. However after reading it to about page 300 I just couldn't go on through the tortured of reading it and I placed the book on my bookshelf were it will stay for a very long time."
2,Stick at what you're good at!,"Well, to be blunt, I think that it would be wise of George Lucas and Chris Claremont to stick with what they are best at. George can direct movies with the greatest skill, but writing this continuation was a task better handled by the masters. Chris is great at writing tales for comic books, but his ability to tell an epic tale is very lacking."
1,Unreadable,"Here's a random quote, decide for yourself: ""Elora wonders if the whole point of the day is to kill her...Her clothes are too ornate and there are simply too many of them to allow her to go to the bathroom."""
2,A big disappointment.,"With names like Lucas and Claremont, this should have been a good book. I've enjoyed Chris Claremont's work on the X-Men. I've certainly enjoyed George Lucas's film work. Given that, this should have been a REALLY fantastic book. It wasn't.Why not?The plot was forced, the character development non-existant, and the writing was AWFUL. Every time something had to be explained, it was compared to something else. Every time. Just try to count the number of times you read ""It a was like"" or ""It was the same as"" or ""like the time when"" - you'll go insane [if you have the book, try this - open to some random page and read - you'll find the one of those three phrases within two pages]. And every time Thorn was in pain, it was worse than the last time. Every time he was confused, it was worse than the last time. Every time anything happened, it was worse than the last time. Whatever.Not worth the time to read. If Lucas makes it a movie, it might be worth a matinee."
1,Unreadable,"Just horrible. Ive read some bad books in my time, but I have always finished them. This one, however, was not one I could finish. Simply horrible."
4,Good Stuff,"This book leads you on a Great ride through the world of willow, and Takes you through the life of Elora Dannon and her quest to save the realms. All together A Good, Good ReadYours trulyC.L. Gray"
4,A exciting book full of great and fantastic stuff,This is an amazing book for those who like science fiction and fantasy combined. This book will capture your attention and take you to a land of untold adventures. Never a dull moment. If you haven't read it go get it now and do so. You won't regret it. And check out the others to this book such as Shadows Dawn and Shadow Star.
1,Ooops!,"George Lucas and Chris Claremont really know how to stop a great story in its tracks. Willow was a wonderful story. This ""continuation"" has very little to do with Willow. They couldn't even use the name Willow after the first chapter. They had to call him Thorn Drumheller. This story is difficult reading in that you can only read about a page at a time or else you run the risk of falling asleep. This says nothing about Fin Raziel, Cherlindrea, Kaiya, Mims, Ranon, Meegosh, Burglekutt, Vohnkar, or the High Aldwin. Sorsha and Madmartigan are only mentioned briefly and even that mention is really out of character with them. I am almost scared to read Shadow Dawn. If you haven't read this book yet, don't. You will only end up becoming disenchanted with Willow."
1,The most boring book I've ever read!,This book was so boring it put me to sleep. I had to force myself to finish reading it. The book was confusing and hard to follow and parts of it were pointless. I see absolutely no connection between it and Willow. Don't waste your money on it
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I have read many fantasy series over the years and this is one of the worst. The general story the series is based on is good, but the author does a poor job of developing it. I read the first two books in this series and never felt the author developed a whole world. I almost put the first book down, but stuck with it and the ending was promising enough to get me to buy the second book. The second book, Shadow Moon, was worse in many ways and I almost quit reading it as well. Unfortunately, I finished it. I was both confused and very disapointed with the ending. Lucas has a great imagination, but it's wasted here. Just don't waste your time."
1,Yuck!,"It's been popular in recent times to write in a style as vague and as confusing as to turn a reader's mind into goo. This book fits the mold! I thought the story line enigmatic and weak, Far less than what credit is given to the Authors who wrote it. When I wish to read fantasy, I wish for clear and easy flowing script (I do read for enjoyment!), Not the Ideas I had to sludge through in this book. As for Willow, this sequel bombs"
3,I saw room for improvement,"I thought this book was strange, but ok.I hated Elora the Brat and I wished they had more of Anakerie. She seemed to be the element of good in the story.To bad the Thunder Riders weren't on the good guys side [or were they?] because i know I wouldn't want to be on their bad side.I also miss the brownies and their sharp wits. More Sorsha and Madmartigan would hav gone a LONG way,too."
3,Shadow Moon,"I like the characters and how things start off. I read this and the other 2 books and the same problem persists with all three ""to much detail"" The auther rambles on and on with pointless things and scenery that cause me to skip places. I understood the point of the whole story but was amazed at how many characters new and old were included. One of my favorite charaters of all time is Khory and would love to have a book written based on her life."
4,"Slow start to the series, but don't give up!","I started this series in book 2 (Shadow Dawn) and by the sounds of many of the other reviews it seems as though if I had started with Shadow Moon I wouldn't have read any further. It's been a while since I read the book, but what I do remember is that though at times slow, it was an engrossing book which I enjoyed thoroughly. What I assume what made this novel slow for some people was the indepth character and plot development the book does. This is a novel that really sets you up for the amazing second and third book, and honestly I found the whole series amazing. Today I have just finished the third book in the series, Shadow Star, and I pity anyone who has not read further than the first book, because the last two are brilliant! I congratulate George Lucas and Chris Claremont for a wonderful series I will never forget!"
3,"Shadow War, Book 1",I found this the easiest of the three books in the Trilogy. I liked the plot and it intrigued me enough to make me want to continue to Book II. It wasn't that complicated to follow and the fantastical elements(while confusing at first) began to come clear.
4,Cinerella 2000 emmas review,"Cinderella by Mavis Jukes is a great book. It is a modern day Cinderella. It is about this girl Ashley Ella Toral, who is 14 and is going though the same problems as a girl at that age but also had to deal with being an orphan. She has to live with her mean stepmother who hates her and to younger twin stepsisters who invade her space reads her diary and more. Phyllis Ashley's stepmother has no clue how to be a parent at all either. Trevor the boy Ashley has a huge crush on asked her to go to a dance with him. The only thing that is wrong with it is she might have to baby-sit the braty unbearable twins!This is a great book for girls 7-10 and I would highly recommend it to girls who like the storey of Cinderella."
4,Great Book,I really like this book because it was a modern day longer version of one of my favorite fairy tales. I love it when my mom used to read me clasic fairy tales and I read a version of my time. I loved this book and I hope you will too
4,cinderella 2000,i liked this book because it show's how every girl dreams about being the bell of the ball. and i like how you love the grandmother for telling everyone off.
2,Don't read this book unless you're a shallow person!,"This book is what makes people have stereotypical thoughts about teenagers. This is like Beverly Hills reincarnated. Not only is the dialogue shallow but the theme is also very very corny. I believe it has nothing to do with the Cinderella theme. The character Ashley, in this book, is the ditziest person I think I will ever read in a book. She dumps her friends for a New Year's bash that excludes a lot of people out. The romance in this book is so cheesy I really wanted to call the author and sit down and talk to her about what teens today are really thinking. I am 14 and find this book horrible. If you want a shallow book to read pick this book."
5,Best all around instant tea,"Lipton Instant Tea Mix, Diet Raspberry, 2.6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)This is the only tea we will drink. It has a great rasberry flavor that taste sweet unlike some diet tea. When you drink this you will never go back"
5,Does not tast diet - and I hate diet drinks!,"If you mix this with the lemon flavor, or add alittle squirt of lemon juice concentrate, it is even better, but even alone this rasberry tea is fabulous at only 5 calories per serving. I am not even a big tea drinker, and I also hate EVERY diet drink I have ever tasted, so that says alot. I am trying to limit calorie intake to loose weight so having an enjoyable sweet drink that I love really helps."
2,tuneless indie rock. not worth youre time,"expect a moor melody driven band given the label there on this is pretty much pretty dull indie rock, mid tempo numbers than go nowhere. thr guitars are tuneless the drums are flat lined and the vocals sound like something out of an old 90's rock band. sometimes it actually sort of works in dim numbers like ""car"" and ""california"". but the music seems so bored with itself some times you cant help but feel the same"
2,Terrible,"This album is terrible. By friendships fade away or whatever the other one is instead. or better yet, go pirate it. this band doesnt deserve to get paid"
4,Good Stuff,Had I had this DVD when I started trading I would have avoided making some very amateur mistakes. This is a good DVD for traders who have atleast some knowledge of the markets. If you are looking for a DVD to go over the simple basics with you this is not your cup of tea. Finance terms are used and basic knowledge of the viewer is assumed.
3,"Great Book, Bad Editing","This is a very useful book: the sport of climbing really needed an dictionary-type work. Unfortunately, the facts needed to be better checked, as in a couple of instances they are incomplete or even just plain wrong. More illustrations would also be good. I hope that a new edition may come out which will correct the above problems and make this book the indispensable tool it deserves to be."
2,Getting a bit tired,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. I did like the first few pages with their introduction of D.P.'s typical characters, like the hero who misjudges and hurts the already wounded heroine, and then has to do some serious grovelling before the happy ending. It sort of was there, and it wasn't. I had the impression Ms. Palmer got bored herself after the first chapters and just hurriedly threw together a few clichés - minor misunderstandings, dream wedding, passionate wedding night, all in too much of a rush - in order to finish off the book. The main characters appeared rather more shallow towards the end, not fulfilling the promise shown in the beginning.This is now about the third or fourth new Palmer novel I have read which left me rather unsatisfied. Couldn't publishers be persuaded to give us some of her older (and better) ones instead?"
3,NOT ONE OF DIANA PALMERS BEST,"I am an avid Diana Palmer fan. I have to say, I was alittle disappointed with this book. The romance in the story was pretty good, but toward the last part of the book I started getting bored. I hate to say that about a Diana Palmer book but this is not one of her best. I did like Reys character and Meredith was sweet but for some reason I just couldn't get to interested.Not a bad book. I would wait and check it out in the library before I would spend money on it."
3,Could have had a better ending,"I like to start off by saying I am a big ""Diana Palmer""fan too.But during this book it seemed like she wasnt putting her all into it.I would have expected a much better ending than the one she gave.I agree with the others,it did seem like she just wanted to hurry up and finish it."
4,Health-o-Meter massager,"I am enjoying the multi-head massager. It works very well. The only thing that is slightly difficult is attaching the different heads to the ""wand"". Once attached, they give a lot of relaxing comfort."
3,Weird sizing,"I recently lost weight and tightened up my lower abdomen with exercising. But, I still ordered my regular size. The shirt fit perfectly across bust, shoulders, and arms. However, snug across belly and hips. Very disappointed. It is a gorgeous shirt and, other than the sizing, just as I pictured it. Trying to decide if I'll hassle with ordering a larger size--which would be more expensive--or just return it and get money back. Don't want a shirt that fits across lower abdomen but hangs loose on upper abdomen!These shirts are supposedly made in the USA, yet the sizing is off. Very disappointed."
1,the rise of the rogue executive,"The authors give both the ideal of what top executives should be doing and how auditors should be auditing,according to the rules of the market system, then show the changes that took place in these roles in the 1990's and why these changes developed, and the serious consequences the changes have for American businesses."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Ithamara Koorax has scored a lot of hits with acid jazz fans, but that's not necessarily a recommendation (in my book, at least).Forget the hype on this one: it's one of the worst Brazilian vocal albums to hit the market in this or any year. if you want the best of the best, try Monica Salmaso, Gal Costa, Marisa Monte, Maria Bethania, Beth Carvalho . . . the list is endless, and includes plenty of men, too. (Go after master sambista Paulinho da Viola's ""Bebadosamba"" for starters.)"
4,Excellent!!!,"Shipped as promised, and received ahead of schedule. My kids love it and compete amongst themselves. Great ""cabin fever"" gift that most kids are learning in PE."
3,A Paul Carrack record...,"Robertson, Rutherford, and Neil continue to write heartfelt lyrics and melodies. What's missing on this record is Paul Young. Yes, he's pictured in the jacket and listed in the credits--but songs featuring him are few and far in between. Definately a Paul Carrack record; in fact it sounds a lot like Carrack's previous work/solo albums rather than a Mechanics record. (Maybe because he co-wrote many of the songs this time 'round?)"
5,"This book helps you understand what ""shape"" you're in.","Outstanding list of ideas on who you, or someone you know, really is. Susan leads you down the path to self understanding and then takes it much further.She explains how you can interact successfully with other people of different shapes in both the business and personal realm.Worth reading, worth passing on to loved ones, and worth giving to your boss"
3,Interesting reading. Great conversation starter.,"Choose your favorite shape and see what it says about you. The book goes into detail describing the psychology of rectangles, triangles, circles, boxes, and squiggles. Fun reading, if you don't take it too seriously. You'll run out and ask all your friends to choose their shapes."
4,Fun Creative Communication,This was a fun reading. I had the opportunity to share these concepts with family and friends. I also conducted a small exercise at work to generate some team building interest and it worked. My co-workers enjoyed it and it created a positive work environment.
3,Out of date - but a good secondary tool,"This book was written when Windows 2000 was still in beta, and is specifically geared towards ADSI 2.0 - not ADSI 2.5, which is what is out and in use today. Given that, this book makes reference to, and shows examples for many commands no longer supported by Microsoft and no longer in use on Windows 2000 (as well as never having been utilized in NT4). The book is a little light, being only about 300 pages, and could use more example code, and fewer background / history lessons. Unlike typical reference books, this book is presented in much more of a mini guide-to-lots-of-stuff, with the true reference-style documentation being primarily in the appendix.Although I have used this book as a learning tool, it remains a secondary book to me, and I can see it sitting on the shelf neglected as there are better true reference books out there."
5,An excellent tutorial for using ADSI with ASP,"ADSI ASP Programmer's Reference covers all the basic capabilities of ADSI. It also ties in those with working examples that tie to Exchange (LDAP), IIS, and WinNT. The numerous examples are well explained and clear. Most of the information is available from Internet sources, but ADSI ASP Programmer's Reference brings all that information in to a convenient book. A definite must have for starting and intermediate ADSI programmers."
2,Good Material but bad editors,When I picked up this book I was very excited and could wait to try it out. To my dismay some of the screenshots of server configurations were blurred out. A very sick joke. Very poor quality control.
2,Not much that I found useful,"I was very dissapointed in this video. There is little useful information on color matching, unless you own an off-white boat. About half of the short (38 minutes) video you watch the author sanding on a boat hull, and stiring pigment into gelcoat. I didn't pay [money] to learn how to sand and stir. Several times the author refered to his gelcoat matching kit, and how you could order it from him. Also, the video quality and directing is poor. If I had known this, I would have saved myself some money."
1,larceny,"The people that made this are crooks.There is at the most,ten minutes of the most basic info. And that is so basic,almost anyone would know it by reading the label on a can of resin.all of the rest of this tape, is useless filler. For instance, film says to use four different cut sandpapers to finish a small spot repair.What you get is the person showing how to put the paper in a sanding block, takes his time. and he shows the whole dragging thing each time he goes to a different grit paper,yes four times,the whole video is like that.Amazon should take this junk off of their site."
5,Best Community episode yet,"Pillows and Blankets is a clever parody of war documentaries such as the ones made famous by Ken Burns. Complete with narration, interviews, and letters from the war front, this delightful story details the events of the biggest pillow fight Greendale has ever seen. If you have never seen an episode of Community, you will still be able to enjoy this episode, as each character is reintroduced for the documentary."
4,A different twist on a comedy....,A little dark humor was not what I expected from this group. Not surprised that the 4th season has been in limbo/jeopardy after watching this season.
5,"One of the greatest TV shows ever, but it's not for everyone","If your preference for television shows skew towards ""According to Jim"" and ""Two and a Half Men"", this may not be the show for you. However, if you find yourself checking for the premier date of ""Archer"" and lamenting the cancelation of shows like ""Better Off Ted"", and you have yet to stumble upon Community, then you'll want to dive into this show.Community is a rare confluence of comedic timing, tight writing, and expressive directing. It's clear that everyone who is part of the show is committed to creating a lasting work of art. Like many shows, season three finds the characters hitting their stride while continuing to develop and surprise the audience. One of my favoriate episodes in all of the TV shows that I've seen is in season three.I can pile on the accolades-- Community is funny, quirky, heart-felt, creative, unique, stimulating, and witty. But ultimately, it's great entertainment."
5,"Community Season 3-I laughed, I cried, It became a part of me.","Ohhh my....Where to begin? I think it is safe to say I would have paid $50 for this Season because it is so, so funny and mind-blowing! It is going to be buried with me. Ha Buy this! You'll laugh, You'll cry, It will become a part of you! :)"
5,#SIXSEASONSANDAMOVIE,"Great cast. Consistently creative show. So many amazing episodes this season. To name a few: Regional Holiday Musical (Glee Parody), Remedial Chaos Theory (they play out six alternate story lines), Studies in Modern Movement (#anniemoves in with Troy and Abed), Pillows and Blankets (civil war documentary style coverage of a pillow/ blanket fort fight), and finally Digital Estate Planning (the study group plays a video game, with 8-bit versions of themselves). There were so many other great ones, but eventually I would just be listing the entire season three episode order.The commentaries (for EVERY SINGLE EPISODE) are a great listen. The cast really seems to enjoy each other's company, and that's very apparent during the commentary.Sad to see Dan Harmon go, but he left with an amazing season to show for his time on the show!!!"
5,Best comedy on TV!,"I watch a LOT of TV, and Community is hands-down the BEST comedy I have ever seen. It is amazingly innovative, with a really sweet and likable cast of misfits. I am always impressed by the incredible range that each of the actors is able to cover, especially considering all of the different genre-spoofing they do."
5,vsr review,This was a good episode better than I first thought. It really managed to get into annie's head.great ep.
5,Amazing,"So much went on this season! I have so many favorite episodes , especially the video game one. I can't wait for season 4! If they don't get a season 5 it'll be Arrested Development all over again ;("
4,Welcome to greendale!,"Welcome greendale human beings! This show is a riot, with an unbeatable cast and off the wall writing. I really hope this shows sticks around for 6 seasons and movie!"
5,Great show,"Definitely watch this show from the beginning. I love this show but I feel that season 3 wasn't as good as season 1 and 2 but it could be because the show almost got cancelled! Do not listen to harsh critics about this show! Listen to the fans and give this show a chance! :D Great deal on Amazon, 50% off and the package arrived 1 week early!"
4,No Eng Subtitle?,"really no English subtitle? then no matter how bad i want it, i probably won't buy it as i may not get the jokes, too bad"
2,Not sure what happened here,"First two seasons were incredible! This one just seemed liked they tried too hard to make you laugh. The ""its so bad its funny"" concept."
3,Terrible Bonus Features,"I'm a huge fan of the show, but I was really depressed at the bonus features. Sony really doesn't care about this show and doesn't even have enough respect for the fans to provide quality bonus material. The episode commentary (especially on the last disc) is terrible. I regret spending money on this."
3,Not the best episode of this show,"I love Community. Love it. It's the best show on television in my opinion. But this episode just didn't do it for me. It had funny moments and the emotional ending moment was powerful, but all in all it could have been SO much better than it was. All the characters on this show are dressed up as celebrity impersonators but we never see them actually impersonate the celebrities they're supposed to be (with the brief exceptions of Shirley and Britta). I was really looking forward to this episode and it kind of let me down."
4,Brilliant!,"Season 3 gives any hardcore community fans exactly what they're used to - with a little bit extra this time around. The storylines are amped up and far more engaging, especially for a half hour show. Episodes like Digital Estate Planning are amazing and definitely good enough to watch more than a handful of times. The only reason it has four stars is because the way the season ended seemed a little dark for me. I wont add any spoilers, but it did leave me scratching my head a bit. Besides that, this season is completely worth buying!"
5,Community: The Complete Third Season,"This is the best present I bought for my self, since I can watch anytime I want. And as many times as I want."
2,Sigh,"Like all good things, Community has appeared to come to an end.The first two seasons were fantastic. So far, I can't even watch the entire episodes of season 3. The only absolutely stunning episode was the apartment episode with the multiple universes. That was amazing. The rest are just awful.I'm very sad, Community is literally the only sitcom I can stomach and it's gone down hill so fast."
1,sucking wind after just 2 1/2 seasons...,"we loved the first 2 seasons of this show....but midway through season 3 dvd we are finding ourselves losing interest in the episode storylines. many of the episodes are way over-the-top. it also seems like the age target of the show keeps getting lowered. at some points it feels like they are shooting for the 15 to 17-year-old boys bracket---video games, pillow forts and secret handshakes. these people are in college...right? the writers appear to be somewhat lost and getting a little desperate with the overuse of recurring [duplicate] episode themes and worn out catch phrases."
5,Network TV's Best Show,"If you're thinking of buying the 3rd season its probably safe to say that you already know and like the show. But should you buy the DVDs when there are plenty of alternatives? Most adamantly YES.1. You support the show and help ensure that more episodes are made. That alone should be reason enough.2. The commentaries are awesome. People on it are the people who you actually want to hear. joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Dan Harmon, everybody is on it.3. The rest of the extra features are great and always available. No more searching for them on YouTube and having to deal with ads/buffering"
5,It was a present for Christmas,The person that we gave it to for Christmas was SUPER excited! He had been waiting and thought it was his best present yet!

It filled a very empty void Arrested Development left behind, with meta humor, rich characters, brilliant writing and most importantly, heart and soul. Dan Harmon has created tear inducing comedy that is clever, smart & unique. Even at the heights of the most bizzare situations imaginable, the characters remain at the heart of everything. Its just too good for basic TV & mainstream.#sixseasonsandamovie"
4,My Favorite Pregnancy Top!,"This was my very favorite top during my pregnancy - comfortable fabric, hip/fashionable style, ample cut/sizing, and (in my case at least) very flattering to my pregnant figure. The only thing I didn't like is that it has ""unfinished"" sleeves...I don't know if that's the correct way to describe it, but the edges of the sleeves are not sewn, so it loses one point for that."
5,A Fine Poetry Collection--Highly Recommended,"Long's book is aptly titled, being on the road with Long is to hear music in the 'low buzz-drone of piston and gear,' and 'hymns sung at the windowsill for starlight' He marks the miles with stunning clarity in 'the things we cast aside.' ""The Singing of the Wheels,"" is a solid collection from an original voice with remarkable range, among my favorites were the poems: ""Enough,"" ""A Guy Thing,"" ""Mile 232,"" and ""Art."""
3,Not exactly bursting with onion,"I use this on top of one of the Japanese 'lunch' boxes of noodles, to provide something more than a ghost of a taste.It is definitely stronger than the original ""Beef flavored"" pasta, but very limited in the amount of dried onion in it.But it is, after all, much cheaper than the really good french onion soup, which is carried by Trader Joe's and made by a chef in Montreal; but that's frozen and so uses up freezer space, as well as expensive."
1,Contents generally in line with the insulting title,Much better massage books out there. These authors actually seem embarrased by anything that could become sensual or sexy. Where does that leave a couple who want to use massage to enrich their life together?
4,A VERY MODERN GARDENIA FRAGRANCE,"Marc Jacobs"" the fragrance is young, fresh, and sensuous. It's pure, understated, simple, and unforgettable.Somehow he has done things with gardenias unheard of before. Remember granny's favorite gardenia perfume, a bit cloying, heavy? Uh-uh forget that. This interpretation of gardenia is cutting edge, it complements without overwhelming the wearer.Notes of Sicilian Bergamot and Tagete mingle with the top note, as accents of White Pepper and Egyptian Jasmine enrich."
5,Love Marc,Great price and my one of my favorite parfum. I would recommend because it's a great scent and nice size for the price.
2,love this fragrance but is barely detectable.,"i love this fragrance, but after putting it on by the time i get to work it's barely detectable. i have even asked coworkers to smell my neck and and there is only a faint trace of it. i use no scented powders or deodorants. dont know if i should return it. it was expensive."
1,Obviously not new.,"I didn't like the idea it was an ""opened"" bottle, not sealed, not in a Marc Jacobs box. It had obviouslly been used.Is it okay to sell used perfumes?"
1,THIS PERFUME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE,I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO WHOSE CHEMISTRY DOES NOT GET ALONG EASILY WITH PERFUME TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS ONE.I LOVE THE SMELL OF GARDINIAS BUT THIS PERFUME SMELLED LIKE DEAD FUNERAL FLOWERS. IT'S GOING BACK ASAP!!
5,Pure B.B. King,"Though I'm not a huge fan of the closing song, this is an amazing concert that is deserving of 5 stars. ""Sweet Sixteen"" alone is mind-bogglingly emotive, to the point of being irrational and out-of-control. It's a real treat to see a young B.B. perform in his prime. I saw him live in concert at Jones Beach in New York, on his 75th birthday. Buddy Guy and the great, young, immensely talented Corey Harris were also on the bill. I picked this dvd up in Itaewon, Korea, an area known for its non-Korean population. It cost me just five dollars. I highly suggest everyone check out this great, albeit short, concert."
4,Great...but not an upgrade if you own the Pioneer version.,"This is a great release if you don't already have this show, but if you own the original ""Live in Africa"" Pioneer DVD release then save your money, this is not an upgrade, in fact it's a slight downgrade. I purchased this thinking there might be a bit of an audio upgrade but there is not. Also, the video bit rate is lower despite the fact that there's added video content on this version including the B.B. King interview and a bunch of annoying ads."
3,THE KING,"AMAZING CONCERT FROM AN AMAZING PERFORMER!I ONLY GAVE 3 STARS BECAUSE MY DVD CASE CAME WITH A BROKEN ""THOOTH"" AND YOU CAN'T CLOSE OR OPEN THE BOX PROPERLY, BUT NEVER THE LESS IS A GREAT CONCERT!"
2,This was a tough book to learn physics from,"Everyone in my class hated this textbook, and as a result, the following year, the department changed to using ""University Physics"" 11th ed, Young&Freedman. This book isn't too bad for somebody who needs to review the material and refresh their memory, but learning it for the first time... this book made it tough."
3,Alley Kat Blues,"Its fun to read. Have collected all of Karen Kewjewski's series in paperback. Started with'Kat Scratch Fever"", then went back and restarted from the first book. That way, I could see the characters developing. Much better that way."
2,"boring, predictable","This is the first Kijewski book I've read and probably the last. The characters had no depth and were relentlessly one dimensional. The plot was totally predictable - within three paragraphs of the introduction of the killer, I knew he had done it! I was intrigued that several of the readers were offended by her portrayal of the mormon church, in particular its treatment of women. This was the one aspect of her plot and characterizations that I found to be interesting and believable."
1,Very Sad,"Karen and I were in a writers group together shortly before she sold her first Kat Colorado book. We all adored her. She's a wonderful person with a great sense of humor. I'm LDS (Mormon) and a few weeks or so before Alley Kat Blues came out she called me to tell me the book might sound a bit prejudiced against Mormons. She was concerned I wouldn't like it. I told her she was certainly entitled to her opinion, but I was surprised she never asked me anything as she wrote it. When it was published, I read the book and felt terribly shocked and disappointed. I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one here on Amazon.com that realizes how little she knew about the LDS faith when she wrote the book. Still, she's an excellent writer and I highly recommend the other books in her Kat Colorado series!"
1,Disappointed!,"I love Kat Kolorado and I've loved reading her adventures especially since I've never been to the southwest and I thought I was learning important info on the area. Now though, I find myself unable to trust anything Ms Kijewski writes about because of the poor research that went into writing Alley Kat Blues. The Latter-Day Saints she describes in her book must come from a different planet because I certainly have never met any like that. And I should know, I am one. It's a shame, really because her stories are very good, but I like a basis of truth even in fiction. I don't know for sure if it was poor research or a personal vendetta against Mormons, but you cannot trust to read the truth in Ms. Kijewski's books. Too bad..."
2,Not that useful,"While this book does fulfill its promise to be ""stranger,"" it cannot stand alone as the only Seattle Guide. There is virtually no practical information about transportation, city layout, or even the city's most visited sights. I got this book hoping it would recommend unusal and inexpensive options for a school trip, but many of the recommended locations were completely inappropriate for students. If you're headed to Seattle as an adult to experience the seedier side of the city, then go for it, but the average traveler would do better to stick with a more typical guide book."
2,STILL the same..,"In the fourth installment, John Saul still tells the same story as in the first three parts. Someone receives a gift - and dies. The only thing which makes this part a little better is that only now some people in Blackstone begin to notice that something is happening. So, the story advances a little bit - but JUST a little bit.."
1,unoriginal hacks,"give me a break. these guys are about the worst example of pre-fabricated mass marketed rocknroll i've ever heard. take equal parts pantera, mix with some corrosion of conformity, sprinkle some southern rock in the mix then subtract any trace of heart or originality and you have brand new sin. heavy rock's equivalent of a boy band. nothing original about it. if you're interested in this swill, do yourself a favor and check out some old sabbath, motorhead, or even the above mentioned pantera, COC. you'd be doing yourself a favor."
5,Rock & Roll is Not Dead!,I caught this band with Motorhead last month and I was impressed as hell. Good hard crunching rock with solid musicians and a great singer. Their CD confirms this. I don't know if they are the future of rock and roll but they are a hell of a positive sign. I'm tired of all the bands that think that volume and attitude are enought. These guys have something to say and they do it well.
4,Return of the ROCK,"If the processed garbage you've been force-fed by corporate radio hasn't totally killed your desire to ROCK, then it's time you tried Brand New Sin.Creed is not ROCK. Coldplay is not ROCK. ROCK is loud, heavy, tattooed, fist-pumping and alcohol-fueled. Brothers and sisters, Brand New Sin is ROCK! Brand New Sin is the band you expect to find at your favorite bar, belting out heavy as hell songs that would make Motorhead and Black Label Society proud.Forget about radio. Forget about trends. Spread the word - ROCK is back, and bands like Brand New Sin and Fireball Ministry are leading the charge. If you miss real hard rock music, check out Brand New Sin."
5,"Great product, great price","Product works great. The price is about half what the brick & morter stores charge. the size is A4, which is annoying but it works."
2,Not As Great As i Expected...,"Couldve Been Glossy, The Paper Felt Cheap And Didnt Tear Correctly Or Easily On The Dotted Lines Like It Should Have."
2,Not as good as other dvd inserts,"If your looking for inserts with vivid colors , and high quality contrast, forget it. The paper stock that Memorex has chosen to use for their inserts, offer low res printing results, with very little attentionto values needed to produce professional DVD covers. I use Adobe Photoshop and print on an Epson Stylus R2400 printer to create custom DVD covers for my clients; and found this product not up to par. The product is probably passable for those who wish to create covers for a home library, but not for the professional"
3,Not for professional use.,"The software is some what cumbersom to use and doesn't offer some of those little things we enjoy like spell check. The card stock is what it is. And it is card stock that is perfectly perferated so that all you have to do is fold and tear and slide it into your dvd case (cut one side if using slim dvd case). That is what I like most about this paper. Print and rip. You don't have to use a cutting board or try cutting a straight line with scissors. The down side is that it is a thicker card stock, the sort used when you print your resume and use paper that is a bit more than just plain paper. The prints are certainly not the quality you get when you buy a dvd, but hey when your burning dvds and stealing cover art from the internet. Why not? They do look slick."
5,Satisfaction,"Exactly what I (wanted)needed in the nick of time. Great service, great price. I'll be back."
3,DVD case inserts,"Have had a lot of trouble trying to get them to print correctly, may be my printer but it works fine for everything else?? They look very good once I finally do get everything lined up but I waste as many as I get to print right."
5,Possibly the best book written on Performance Anxiety,"As an opera singer, this book has helped me deal with my performance anxiety, not just on stage, but in life as well. I recommend this book without reservation."
5,An excellent study of stage fright,"An excellent guide to overcoming and coping with one of our most basic fears....I've found useful information from this book for not only stage situations and Forensic competitions, but also for daily situations when performance anxiety can occur. Great topic and a great collection of thoughts on the matter."
5,"Entertaining, educational and well written - no illustrations",I had a series of these books as a kid that were so well illustrated - that's what I was hoping this was - I was disappointed - no illustrations - but otherwise my 11 year old daughter and I enjoyed finding out about some famous people in history - you can easily get through a book in a night with an older child - or spread it out over a week and it makes Ameilia Earhart a human that you can really imagine.
5,Excellent book,I highly recommend this book.Very easy for kids to read. Super informative and really brings the subject to life.
5,Perfect for a 5th Grade Report,I ordered this for my Grand Daughter to use for a report (biography). Her teacher approved it as a source. Perfect!
3,"Good book, but...","I have gone through this book, and find that it lacks systematic detailed information on the Preparations section, before being able to attempt the examples in the book. In my opinion this is a very serious drawback, and can throw off readers new to JNDI. So, in essence this book can be further improved upon by the authors with due consideration to the initial preparedness and loading of seed data sections, to enable the readers who attempt the examples, a more fruitful and enjoyable experience."
4,get it online,"I heard the material was the same, but was hoping for a more thoughtful layout and more of a teaching perspective. No such luck."
3,only book so far with the JNDI lesson GO FOR IT if you need a book on JNDI,This book is basically the same thing as on the sun website. It came without a cd although the authors mentioned a cd in the book for source code lookup.I have the impression the book was out of print because of the already mentioned cd issue and the fact that amazon had to wait for long time to get this book from the publishing warehouse(This is the reason amazon gave me for delaying the shipping)This book is half tutorial(0-396) half API(397-756) with some bonuses like LDAP schemas.
2,Definitely not for a novice,"Having about a year or so experience with Java, I bought this book intending to use JNDI on a project. I was hoping for a clear, simple tutorial; instead I had to wrestle with setting up my environment for at least two hours before I could even run one sample program. The authors do NOT clearly state which .JAR files have to go in jre/lib/ext, they do not explain that the path in the samples needs to be changed from /tmp/tutorial to whatever directory you are working in, and some of their examples are wrong (page 27 - the Lookup program does NOT take a command-line argument). I haven't started the Directory Operations chapter yet (since it requires an LDAP server and I haven't installed one yet), but if it took this long just to get through the basics, I have a feeling I'm going to be spending a lot of time reading Sun's forums looking for answers..."
2,JNDI for truck drivers,"I don't know who writes such books and who reads them. 800 pages of garbage. Instead of explaining what JNDI is, they show millions of lines of code, use us how to import packages and catch exceptions.I only wonder - are technologies failing because there are no good tutorials, or bad technologies provoke writing bad books."
3,No cooking instructions?,"My rice packet did not come with any cooking instructions, so I googled some instructions (and I am glad I did, as it involved several steps). The rice was wonderful once I spent the time to figure out how to prepare it!"
5,Its the only movie in English about Sartre,"This is the only movie to my knowledge which shows Sartre in all his fire and passion! An excellent film! A must have for the Die Hard Sartre fan! Sartre's Neurotic energy is abundantly manifest in this well directed documentary. It's a shame that the english going public does not have access to more of these films, and that these films are not more reasonably priced. Still, this film is excellent and a rare, rare, rare glimpse into the philosopher of existentialism!"
5,Very Nice,"I am very happy with the banner. It is huge! It reads well on both sides, not just one side."
3,Nice looking flag but,This is not a true 2 sided flag as listed. The Saints logo on top is on both sides but the helmet and stripe are only on one side. The hang tabs are a nice touch but the sewn in sleeve is designed to fit a massive flag pole of some sort. The sleeve is the size of the Saints logo and my arm can fit inside (6 foot tall 200 lb man). I have a wooden flag pole similar to the one on the picture so I will need to get creative with zip ties to hold it in place. I only paid $18 shipped so I can get over it.
1,Rusty disaster,"I wanted to replace the flame deflectors in my hybrid gas/charcoal grill to use lava rocks and this item was the closest in width and length. I had to cut the rack down to size for use. The item served its purpose, but after about a month, this product has proven to be quite an inferior product. The item is rusting badly sitting inside my grill. My grill is always covered when not in use with a multi-layered waterproof and weatherproof canvas cover. I'm surprised other buyers of this product in a different size didn't comment on this. I don't think it should be something that is acceptable because the grate will continue to deteriorate and require another replacement. I wish I had known about the inferiority of the product so I could avoid purchasing the item. Since I trimmed it already, I don't think I can return the product."
1,RUST!!!,it's already rusted and I haven't even used it! I can't think of 11 more words to use that could be submitted!
4,Great Steak,"The steak was great. I am not sure if it was the grill, the steak or me, but nevertheless it worked very well and the steak was delicious! Cheers!"
3,It's ok,"I read all the reviews and was expecting something really great. My 16 month son will watch a couple shows, but shows no interest in this one. It is done nicely, but the music is slow and calm and it just doesn't catch his attention. The children show foam letters at a park and then it goes to letters with pictures of objects that starts with that letter and then it goes back to kids and a park.I think it is a nice addition to your video collection, but don't look for it to teach your kids to read all by itself."
5,It's awesome,"I bought this to my son when he was 9 months by the time he was a year old would you believe that he knew the whole alphabet and knew each individual letter, it's amezing..I would love to buy the whole set..also the numbers he counts 1-20 he loves it!great investment I tell you! I can't wait to start w/ the colors!"
5,fantastic teaching aid,"My mom bought a couple of these for our daughter over a year ago. Since then we've collected the entire set! Kids are absolutely glued to them and they learn at an incredible rate. Our daughter is not quite 2 and has been able to recognize and recite numbers 1-20, the entire alphabet, all of the shapes, colors, animals, signs, and opposites for months! She's heads and tales ahead of her peers. I highly recommend these for your kids or as gifts to the kids in you life- they're fantastic! Your kids will sing and laugh and dance their way to learning- it's effortless!:)"
2,Hard to fit,"Have trouble getting it to go together with the wii controller, could improve on it, not to happy about the product, would not have bought it if I knew it was so hard to get together."
3,Not quite the real deal,"Bought for my 95 year old Polish mother in law. She wanted some Polish polkas. The music was good, but she said it wasn't authentic. Said it was bland and ""watered down"". Not what she was looking for I think it's similar to when they take rock and roll songs and make them into ""soft rock"". There wasn't enough accordion use and it just didn't have that 'zing' to it. His music is good, just not what we were looking for."
4,I love this guys voice,"This is a decent tape on Sun style tai chi. It has some people (americans) being interviewed who talk a lot of new age rubbish. And the narration is kind of ""new agey"", but I love the narraters tone and direction. Quickly goes through the 8 pieces brocade chi kung routine. Then goes through the full tai chi routine, then he breaks each movement down. As being one of the only tapes on Sun style, I recommend this to anyone inerested in the style or tai chi in general. The teacher on this tape certainly knows tai chi, and his movements can teach you something. Doesn't show applications of the forms, too bad."
2,disappointed,"I was truely craving Korean food and want to learn to make it. Well, i have to say, the book has too exquisite of food in it. Not traditional food you will find at most restaurants or even in the open market. And what's up with it being written in a language other than Korean??? I speak English but also know some Korean and am very disappointed with the fact that it isn't even written in Korean........."
2,more for a western palette...,"I must admit this book is great for its visual appeal. It makes my mouth water just looking at the pictures. But aside from this, I think the final dishes taste less authentic in my opinion (fyi.. I am Korean) As another reviewer pointed out, the owners of Woo Lae Oak put this book out. Those restaurants are more geared towards the Western palette- food is much, much sweeter and different from what I am used to. If you are looking to emulate the taste of the dishes in Korean restaurants in a Korea-town area of a certain city then these recipes will not give you that.."
4,Excellent picture and Easy to Follow,"I actually own 3 of Wei-Chuan books because all of the books have great pictures and easy to follow instructions. I'm a beginner so it was easy to follow; however, it didn't quiteexplain what some ingredients are like tzuyoum, mirin, five-spice power and more. As a beginner, I had no clue where tofind these ingredients besides that they are in a Chinese market. Problem is, I don't know what it is supposed to look like and the Chinese people there don't understand what I am looking for."
4,nice addition to my cookbook collections,It came in a nice condition. It has great translation in English with photo of each dishes. That's very important to me. If you like Korean food. This is a good one to have to make your favorite dish.
5,Bob is Boss,"Excellent product. My two year old grandson loves puzzles and this might be his favorite. It's easy to put together, the pieces are safe and durable."
1,Defective batch,"We ordered this twice having been ""happy"" with it for years; both bottles had turned and smelled rancid. We wont try again."
1,Expected better from Blackhawk,Bottle it self is nice (typical Nalgene) but the lid design stinks. Leaks all over the place if you don't keep it up right. Would be 5 stars if the thing didn't leak.
3,"Great for Around the House, Lousy For Use in a Car","First the good points: It's BPA free, and it holds 32 ounces of water, a lot more than most sports water bottles hold.Unfortunately, this water bottle is awful for use in a car. First, it's too wide to fit in a standard car's cup holder. Second, if placed on a car floor, it tips over very easily, and whenever it does, the top almost always pops open and the water spills all over the place.If you plan to use exclusively at home, you don't need to worry about knocking it over so much, so in that case I would recommend it. If, however, you want something to take along on road trips, pass it up."
4,Praise Him!,"This is a very well put together album. I enjoyed the lyrical praise to Him from beginning to end. Well almost, #4 is the only one that I didn't enjoy as much as the rest. I look forward to hearing more great things from this... group."
3,Very good 1st attempt,"This is an enjoyable read. Very good story with a message for us all. I think everyone will be able to relate to the characters in one way or another. As a first book, I think Hank Stewart has the potential to be a great story teller. I would recommend this book to others."
2,Not worth the money,"While there were some interesting quotes, this book will leave most fans feeling somehow cheated since the entire book could be read by any child or adult in one sitting. It's definitely not so much a book that was researched and then written as it is a book composed of a bunch of quotes all randomly thrown together. There are much better books out there on racing so save your money and buy one of them."
4,Make sure you have enough power,"Purchased to replace a failing OS PATA HDD from a 10 year old desktop PC.I checked the old manufacturer's manual for the PC and found no incompatibilities.WARNING:Apparently the additional power requirements were too much for my aging PC. My power supply should have plenty of wattage to spare, but power supply wattage supposedly decreases with age.Anyway, the power supply failed to provide enough power and screwed up something on my old Maxtor slave HDD. Oddly enough it started working again after running ddrescue. Finally I had to disconnect the Maxtor slave HDD to keep the new WD HDD happy with enough power.PRO:Still working after 2 months of light usage.CON:Requires more power than previous IDE HDD.~25% more W to spin-up~100% more W for read/write~100% more W for idlestandby & sleep are roughly the sameOTHER:OEM WD HDD includes jumper connector, this was as expected.OEM WD HDD does not include PATA cable or mounting screws, but this is also as expected."
2,Downhill for WD...,"The click of death arrived exactly 2 years and 2 days after my purchase, just past the warranty. Nice going Western Digital. You have mastered the art of JUST ENOUGH to get by. Not the quality I had expected or experienced in the past with WD drives. Switching to Seagate ST3250623A-RK (250 GB Ultra ATA/100) with a 5-year warranty. May I never have to depend on WD again, and can only thank them for wasting my time..."
4,Good price for an item thats getting harder to find,idee hard drives are getting harder to find localy for a good price. SATA or taking over the market yet oler computers still run off these bad boys so it was nice to find one for a great pice.
1,Damaged,"This Hard Drive arrived damaged. Ya fue reportado que el componente llego dañado, no arranca. Fue. Verificado por un Tecnico y en un laboratorio."
5,Awesome Drive,"fast boot time, doing great still months later and I use my laptop for work. not to mention great price"
4,WESTERN DIGITAL 160 HARD DRIVE,I have purchased 3 of these hard drives with all being easy to install and set up. The only thing that could make this item even more enjoyable would be a lower price.
2,Probably a good drive - I couldn't tell,"My HD was DOA. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to wait for another delivery by mail and had to resort to Best Buy. The hard-drive is probably great when you get a good one. Amazon was terrific about the return."
5,Great value,Good value for the budget minded! I use a fair number of replacement laptop drives and these perform well at a price I can live with.
5,Product great when functional.,This Hard Drive came to me completely non functional. Contacted Western Digital for warranty replacement. Seller and I agreed to a reasonable refund as it has cost us both time and money. Not the sellers fault the drive was bad.
4,Larger HDD,"I needed more HDD space on my old computer, so I went with WD. I liked the software that came with it ( downloaded on there site ) to clone your old HDD worked great. Easy install, I have had it in for about 3 weeks works great."
2,"great drive, no instruction","i should have listened to previous reviewers and skip buying this drive. i was designed to hard-core geek to install these things. no paper instructions, just a plain drive delivered. i had to referred to online instructions and my personal computer's help menu to figure the format and partitions in order to prepare the drive. in short, i you have never upgraded a computer before, don't try this one, try one with a kit and instructions somewhere else."
2,WD1600AAJB - 160G PATA,"These drives are susually solid, as Western Digital does a good job. First one, out of the box, was DOA.The second worked fine.BEWARE...these drives from Apex Suppliers are out-of-warranty. I attempted to register the good drive and it was out-of-warranty in 2011."
5,Western Digital Hard Drive,Great product. I have always liked Western Digital stuff and htis drive is very nice for the price. It's nice to have a huge 160GB of storage. It worked perfectly as soon as I plugged it in and has been going for a while now. No problems! Nice job WD!
3,not a barn burner,This is a decent drive -- it wasn't a bargain -- low cache but otherwise a respectable drive.
3,feb-2012: beware wrong drive inside the box,"Feb-2012: if you are thinking about purchasing this drive, please be aware that the drive I received is WD800 (80GB) and not the WD1600 (160GB) as advertised. The replacement drive is also wrong as it probably came out of the same warehouse. The generic box has a label that states it is a WD1600AAJB but the drive inside is WD800AAJB. The serial number on the box label matches what the drive label is, so I think the supplier messed-up and short-changed Amazon. I don't think I can fault Amazon for this problem."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE,"I had one of these for less than a week before it died, the bios would see the drive but windows refused to. I exchanged it for another of the same and the replacement drive does not have the correct size mounting holes on one side-the screws will slide in and out. The replacement also caused failure and data damage to the primary drive in my system. The Windows error checking utility has been running overnight trying to fix the damage cause by this drive."
5,Good Performance/Speed,"I bought this hard drive 7 months ago and I'm using it as a USB storage, I use it everyday for data storage and never had problems, I'm planning to upgrade to 1 TB next month."
2,Dead in 5 months,"I bought this in May '10 to extend the life of an old PC with IDE disk controllers. Great price for a good size in old technology. For almost five months it was great. But one day in October '10, without any warning whatsoever, it has stopped working entirely. As far as the computer sees, even in BIOS and even with swapping around the data and power cables and the jumper, the disk is simply not there (but a different disk is still working okay, so it is the new disk and not the controller which is the problem)."
3,Western Digital,"This drive arrived in good shape and in good time. I must applaud Western Digital's web site for providing clear instruction and ""easy to use"" software for the installation."
4,Great little drive!,Just plugged this little baby in and cloned from an older drive and off it went as expected. I love when things work.The access time on this drive is better then the old drive it replaced.
3,"Good, but not new","Hard drive SMART test data showed that the drive I received is in decent shape, but already had hours of use on it. Based on the Date Code, the hard drive is already out of warrantee, so I hope it lasts."
3,Basic OEM Hard Drive,This hard drive is a very basic OEM version. No cables are included or hardware (screws). I would recommend using this hard drive in a RAID array.
2,Dead on Arrival,"Sad to say this drive was dead on arrival. It was purchased as a slave drive. The BIOS reported it as a drive with 0 megabytes. Windows would not recognize it. After much research and fiddling I called Western Digital and they agreed that the drive was dead and they issued a return authorization. They replaced this drive with a 500GB which is working fine, so I have no problem with Western Digital tech support. I guess I just got a bad drive."
5,A Direct Replacement,"So far, I've been through an 80GB, a 160GB, and this 320GB hard drive for my Dell Inspiron B130, the result of 400 YouTube videos and the giant video files generated by the need to create them.I've also bought 2 1TB external hard drives to store those files and started pulling unneeded video files off my internal hard drive to keep things cleaned up. Seems to be working."
4,Western Digital 160MB HD,"Installed this hard drive to replace OEM Western Digital 40 GB in a 7 year old Dell computer. Drive was totally compatible with existing components. It works as anticipated. The Western Digital 160GB appears faster, however that can be due to the fact that previous HD was nearly at capacity."
1,Bad Merchant,"I rec'd the hard drive, but was used and would not boot up. I have contacted the merchant, but refuses to listen to my complaint or authorize a return...Do not purchase from FATBOYRULES!!!"
2,Had trouble with this drive,"I had trouble with this drive. I installed it and tried to clone my smaller drive to it but it never took. It just froze. Well I have not been able to use it, so I really didn't like it."
3,"Seems to work, but time will tell!","Having had 2 very old hard drives, in different computers, die within 30 days of each other I find it hard to trust any hard drive especially since these are the old tech IDE drives and you don't get a lot of choices.I did lose some data but most of my data had been backed up.ALWAYS DO FREQUENT BACKUPS!!!I will clone my drives with SATA USB external hard drives and have an adapter to be able to use it in my old computer along with frequent Document Files backups on another external HD. This is much cheaper than building another computer when the current one works so well!I also recommend you allow this HD its own power cord without sharing it. I originally had it sharing power and the HD was not functioning properly after 3 months."
3,Not used yet,"I cannot write a review for this hard drive since I have not used it yet, and I can't return it."
3,software sucked,the drive works fine i tried to use this hard drive to replace an ailing one i used this ancronis program which came from western digital and i could never get my boot sector to transfer so i guess i have backup copy .THIS SOFTWARE IS JUNK
1,Just A Thin Layer of Cardboard to Protect Hard Drive,"I received the hard drive via US Mail.The hard drive rested on some flat uninflated plastic airbags so the result was that there was only a line layer of cardboard between the hard drive and the bottom of the box. This makes the hard drive inherently unreliable. Even if it works now, the probability of failure with valuable data lost is great. There was nothing to indicate that the post office had any reason to handle it gently and not throw it around.So I will have to return it. I am not going to take the chance."
1,how do I install this product,the hard drive arrived without any installation instructions or mounting hardware. It didn't even have a packing slip.
4,Western Digital 160gb drive,"Wd drives have a good rep for reliability, and 160gb is a good size for dual booting Windows and Linux."
5,Great IDE drive for extra storage on older computers,This hard drive is the best money can buy considering this is an older style PATA/IDE interface. Windows XP installed without a problem and the drive works flawlessly.For those who buy this and are looking for a fancy Western Digital Retail box this is not the right product for you. This is a bare OEM drive that does NOT include any accessories like store bought hard drives.
4,"Great fan ,poor instrutions","Fan is very quiet,and powerful.But the instructions are bad,If you can study the drawings and get half the writing instructions you can do it."
5,Works great,Quiet. Not easy to find a nice horizontal mounted vent fan. We use it in the bathroom and it works great.
4,Brutally frank tell all about prison life.,"The author of this book, a California criminal attorney, who has represented prison gang members, tells a brutal but reality based story of a young hispanic's terible journey to prison and his ""redemption."" Not recommened for the weak stomached or those who may disagree with anti-catholic church sentiments expressed therein."
4,Good music is not dead.,"Two is a charm for this highly talented band:their new opus,'Slaves of the New World'is a strong candidate for the best rock album of the year.If you like House of Lords,Giuffria,Hardline ,or Giant,give this album a spin!"
1,Painful to watch,"This is the last time Ans Records gets money from me.I think they bought the cheapest copy they could find of this film, put it on a DVD and took some images and processed them in Photoshop to put on the cover. To look good.What I bought is a collection of scratches and film imperfections of all kind. The quality of the copy I bought is so bad it is painful to watch.I give 1 star to Carlos Gardel and his songs.What a disservice to the Argentinian music and movies."
3,The Hiram Key was better,"Moving farther away from Freemasonry, Chris and Robert try to explain our origins of human civilization. This book is longwinded, drawing on the conclusions of their first book. If you are looking for a book about Masonic history, this isn't the best read. However, I did really like The Hiram Key, and I am looking forward to reading Turning the Hiram Key."
5,What We Have Been Waiting For!,"Harry, with Mouse in tow end up at a horror convention and something spooky goes this way. And the whole investigation is complication because his best friend's elder child is wrapped up in a not so nice sort of way. And nothing is quite clear as sub-plots are getting pretty quick. But now he has an awesome mini-Chicago in his lab the allows him to work his magic at a greatly increased range. Besides this, he gets no help from anyone unless he considers them a Friend.A few Other Things have taken score and are trying to cause Harry to Join the Club. Though it all, he maintains that one man can indeed make a difference. Well, one hero with a whole heck of a lot of Friends.It is getting hard to write these things without spoilers. The best things are the Charity and Molly scenes, and Mouse is making scene all by his lonesome. More and more reasons to keep up with the series.>>> This is one of Dresden Fan's favourites, at least as for right now. >>>"
5,Proven Guilty,I love the dresden files. I really love them. The way Jim Butcher writes about the terrifying creatures harry is against is amazing.go dresden
3,Drags a bit but good,"The end seemed to drag on for just a bit too long. The whole icky final scenes with Harry and Molly were just...well, icky. It doesn't matter what did or didn't happen, the truth is Butcher just didn't need to go there. It was more of a pandering to forbidden desires while letting Harry keep the high road. It just plain didn't need to be done.And can we stop with the final, let's all sit down and remind the reader of all the bad things still out there at the end so we can justify the need for the next installment? We love Harry. We want more stories about Harry. But we don't need the recap at the end of every novel.This audio version is wonderfully read by James Marsters. He does an exceptional job voicing Harry and the others from teenage girls to old cynical wizards."
5,God I love this series!!,"I liked the very first book in the Dresden series. With each additional episode it just gets better. I loved this book, thought it was one of the best so far. I particularly like the character development of all of the regulars. Mouse has got to be one of my favorites. It is so hard to wait between books for the next in the series. If I could just control myself enough to read more slowly but, au contraire, as soon as I pick it up I know I am in till the finish. This is a book worth getting especially for those of you who already love the series."
4,Saga Continues...,"Not a bad story, but not as intriguing as the others that preceded it. The dynamics of relationships is not Harry's strong suit, and his continual yearnings get a bit tedious quickly.Still, should please most fans."
5,Amazing series,"The Dresden Files are the most action packed books I have ever read. Each of the books gave me at least one good laugh, and not just in my head, but a real out loud laugh. Butcher has an amazing wit and can write battles that will keep you on the edge of your seat. A few steamy sex scenes were very entertaining as well. I cannot imagine any action/adventure/fantasy reader not enjoying this series."
5,Another Great Dresden Tale,"In Butcher's 8th volume of the Dresden Files series, a more mature and introspective Harry must reconcile his personal prejudices with his new position as a Warden of the White Council. In this tale, he takes on demons stalking a horror convention, training his apprentice, the fae, fallen angels, and analyzing his own faith - or lack thereof.Butcher delivers another stay-up-all-night, funny, and action packed story. I can't get enough of this series."
1,Never Again,Book came in generally beaten up shape and is missing the Dust Jacket. Did not see any mention of this on the page.
4,Dresden being Dresden,This book moves the myths forward and introduces some major characters. Like a lot of the books after reading a few some of the standard exposition gets repetitive but this is needed. All in all a good book in the series
5,I enjoyed this book,I enjoyed this book and it was another great effort by Jim Butcher. Excellent read! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book.
5,Wonderful!,"I really looked forward to reading this Jim Butcher novel, and was far from disappointed. It was a page turner, and very well written, as all the Dresden books are. There hasn't been a Dresden book yet that I haven't liked. Definitely recommend this book and the entire series."
5,Harry Dresden just keeps getting better & bettter,"I had written a nice long review about how Jim Butcher continues to amaze me by improving on Harry in every new book without relying on repeating major parts of prior books in the series to ""fill-out"" the book but, my computer conspired against me(maybe I've got a touch of the same effect Harry does on technology) and Internet Expolorer crashed before I could submit the review.So, I'll just say if you have been reading the series you will not be disappointed in this book.If you haven't read Jim's Harry Dresden series and you should take a look at it if you like the thought of a private detective who's actually a wise cracking honest to goodness Wizard with a soft spot for the ladies."
3,Proven Guilty,This story was hard for me to follow. I really had to work at it to finish. I will keep reading them. .
4,Top notch book on thin films,"My Ph.D. research was in thin films and this is the only book that I keep at my desk. I give it to the new employees that I mentor as an into to all major deposition techniques. It does need to be updated though. It does not include many of the newer techniques such a pulsed DC sputtering, cathodic arc deposition, ect. If your getting into thin films, this is an excellent into book."
4,very inspiring,This book gives you a wide range of coping skills.It is good to keep this book at hand to remind you of the things you should be doing to reduce stress. It is very inspiring since it uses biblical scriptures that motivate and inspire you to overcome daily stresses.It is very uplifting.
2,get off your soapbox!,"This book held my attention for awhile (well, I was trapped on a plane), but the more I got into it, the more the author irritated me. Her soapbox, which is anti choice, pro adoption, was too over the top. As I came to know the character Pipa ( I think was her name) you just KNEW that she would not end up giving up her uninvited baby for adoption, as the author wants you to believe. But the author was hell bent on making sure her personal beliefs were inserted into her fictional book and ruined her character's true persona. Right wing women will eat this up. As for the rest of us...blek!"
2,This book lacked depth into the characters' relationships.,I thought that Beth seemed very shallow and self-serving. The characters' stories didn't seem to come together well.
2,"Still a fan of the author, but not of this book","I have read most of Elin Hilderbrand's books, and have enjoyed all of them. I was hopeful when I bought this one that I would feel the same way. I read the whole book but was disappointed. I honestly did not like any of the characters in this book, which makes it very difficult to like a book. I will definitely continue to read books by Ms. Hilderbrand, but this was definitely not a favorite."
3,"Elin, What Were You Thinking?","I love all of this author's books, except this one! There are implications about the charactors, like Piper for instance, that never develop. It is implied that there is something not to trust about this young woman, and then in the end, she becomes the Virgin Mary! The ending also makes no sense to me. There are too many unanswered questions about what happens to the central charactors. Not her best work."
4,Enjoyable Book,"This was a very enjoyable read. The characters very real with real problems, emotions, and the ability to enjoy life and each other. I don't live near a beach so always enjoy it through someone else's eyes."
3,A little boring...,"I found the book a little boring. I don't usually write reviews, but I read them all the time. I read this book based upon other reviews and was disappointed in this book. The characters were not developed well at all. The story was slow moving. This was my first Hilderbrand book and I will give her one more try in hopes that this was just not one of her better books."
1,Awful!,"The sample seemed to say the book would dwell on the representation of a women charged with murdering her sister in law and niece. Also, the sample talked of the mother of teenagers coping with the recent loss of their father. The book is hung up on the love life of 17 year old twins. Even worse is the focus on the ""scandal"" surrounding the twins' mother. Not a scandal at all but the fact that she was married for a couple of weeks years before meeting her recently deceased husband. Preposterous!! Turned me off to and future Hilderbrand novels."
3,Didn't like as much as others,"Strange, this is one of her older books, but I liked it a lot less than some of her newer ones. Usually with authors I like, I like the newer stuff less than the older books, but this is probably my least favorite Elin Hilderbrand book I have read. The main characters are pretty self-centered and for that reason, they are annoying and unlikable, especially at the end, and when I was finished, all I could think was ""that was it?"". By comparison, my favorite EH book so far has been Blue Bistro."
5,Summer People,"I picked up this book while vacationing on Nantucket, I've read three of her books in the past and have loved them each in their own way. I recently finished The Island and I thought she could not be topped, Summer People was equally as good! There is nothing better than reading her books while on a Nantucket Beach, even better is reading during the winter and remembering the warmth of the charming town and magical beaches."
3,Not high quality Hilderbrand,I love Elin Hilderbrand's books and have read them all. This book was not up to her usual standards. The ending was forced and boring. Did not enjoy this one at all.
2,Disappointing...,"This book features an unpleasant cast of characters in the Newton family; I found myself rooting for Marcus and David to find some happiness, but couldn't care less about the rest of this bunch. Beth, especially, is thoroughly self-centered and unpleasant -- how charming that she married her husband for other reasons but ""grew to love him."" Arch was the lucky one in this family."
2,a good Read,Realy felt like I was one of the charactors visiting the island for the summer. When I get involved in a book like this it was darn good.
4,Summer People,I love books by Elin Helderbrand. They take place at the beach and a nice easy read. I love beach novels and this one was really good.
3,Summer People,The book was an easy read. Very light and predictable. It was my first time to read from this author. I think I will give her another chance.
4,good but not great,"I read this book on a beach vaca. Somehow the ending seemed to not fit the buildup, I thought there would be more. Seemed like she needed to finish it quickly."
2,Not her best,"Did not keep me interested but being a big fan, I kept waiting for something to happen. Skip this one, won't get that time back spent wasted reading it."
4,good beach read,this was the first book i read by this author. perfect for the beach or a quiet rainy weekend. I will be reading other titles by this author.
2,"Great story, hard to read on Kindle.","Elin Hilderbrand never disappoints with her novels. This one, however, was poorly scanned into Kindle format. The smudgy bold font was difficult to read even on the higher font size choices. Many words were above or below the rest of the words on the line, and some word parts were so askew, they were embedded in other words. If you would like to read this book, do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks on the paperback copy."
5,Truely Wonderful......,"I have this book, it is beautiful, and fun. It is great for all Alice lovers, young and old. Makes a wonderful gift, for everyone."
5,dutch tilders is a STAR,"I first saw and heard this group at a Jazz festival many years back, in Surfers Paradise, Australia. I followed them around all weekend....could not get enough of their unique sound. King of the Blues!!!!!!!!!!"
4,fyi,this product was listed as an aprilaire replacement part. when I recieved it the water distribution tray had a rubber or fiber gluded in strip with the bumps on it for water distribution.the original had the bumps as part of the plastic strip. I emailed seller and they replied very timely stating it was aprilaire part but had no information on the strip.When I had my furnace cleaned I asked my serviceman about this. He said he noticed this on recent units he installed. He believes they are like this because some people when cleaning the strip rub off the bumps thinking they were part of the dirt build up. This is what I had done hence ordering a new strip. The fiber strip is much more visible. I hope it will last so water can be distributed better.
2,SQL DBA would not feel it much useful,"I bought this book because of its name. However after I read it, I am very disappointed.The reason is that1. It does not not cover in-depth experience/knowledge/troubleshooting. 2. The details of the table are like a plate of salad. So much NT and SQL Server basic stuff most of reader should already know and do not want read it. 3. The most disappointing part is that it does not touch real-world trouble from SQL DBA about backup and restore."
5,Mind blown!,"This early film from Matt Riddlehoover is amazing... The plot, perfect. The actors, on point! Another must see from Matt!!!"
2,"Riddlehoover is beautiful, but that's not enough","I had absolutely nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, so I watched this film ONLY because Matt Riddlehoover was the writer/star/director/editor/etc. Riddlehoover is beautiful, but that's not enough to carry this film. This movie is poorly scripted, acted, directed, and edited. There are jump edits worse than those I saw on Super 8 film 30 years ago in a college filmmaking class. I see something promising in Riddlehoover's performance every now and again, but I fear it's little more than his stunning good looks."
5,"Joe Hiassashi, Best Ever! ^^","I just love he`s work, he`s music changes from time to time, and when you look at the bautifull tracks from ""Spirited Away"" to ""Holw`s Moving Castel"" you can tell that this composer love music.It`s bautifull, big and sweet on the same time.^^cd to love ^^"
3,They say it's a classic...I don't know.,"Kids like it; I thought it was too long & hard to follow. One must be a lover of foreign animation to appreciate this one, I suppose."
2,Mask of the Avenger,"I liked this movie when I saw it on television, but the vhs tape contained colorant which is a product so the tape can not be reproduced. John Derek was excellent in the part but the vhs tape played very poorly so I can not recommend it to anyone."
4,An alternately heartbreaking and funny coming-of-age novel,"Danny Graubart's father is drinking too much, and his mother is having an affair. Complicating his life is an autistic brother, Fad, whose condition has so deteriorated that he can barely function amid Danny's already dysfunctional family.""The Boy Who Went Away'' offers apoignant look at a watershed summer through the eyes of a confused 14-year-old. Written in a spare, straightforward style, the book is at once heartbreaking and funny -- an impressivework that artfully avoids the cliched trappings of the coming-of-age novel."
3,Amazing,This book is amazing my daughter is autistic I love her dearly I would never let anything bad happen to her . She means the world to me.
5,not all but a good sampling,"As usual one could cry about who is not included (Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Baez, Arlo, Fred Neil, to mention a few). But what is included here is an excellent sampling of songs and artists who fit very well together and are representative of the era. A lot of tunes that I don't otherwise have already and probably would not have had in my collection, if it were not for there inclusion here. That in itself is worth the price of admission.Stuff like Oliver's ""Good Morning Starshine"". By the way can anybody else here the seeds of John Denver there?"
2,Not up to snuff,"This compilation contains a fairly good, if routine, selection of songs, although I never thought of ""Angel of the Morning"" or ""Everybody's Talking"" as folk songs, but I suppose just about any mellow pop song from the '60's COULD be interpreted as, or associated with, folk music, so I guess it's a matter of opinion. Regardless, my main issue with this CD is the sound quality. It's not terrible, but it's definitely noticeable, and not up to par with other labels who reissue countless oldies compilations, such as Universal, Rhino, and Ace. Because of my dissatisfaction with the sound quality I doubt I will buy another CD from the label, Top Sail Productions."
5,ROCKIN' ELVIS AT HIS BEST!,"This is the BEST of the McFarlane Elvis figures in terms of likeness and detail. I have the '68 Comeback figure, but this one is even better. It really captures the young, 1950's Elvis at his best! I love it."
5,Primo Quality,"The quality of manufacture and attention to detail that goes into these McFarlane figures is exceptional. I'm not a big action figure guy but I love rock and roll and have always been a huge Elvis fan so I wanted this pretty badly. I was semi-expecting some lame, cheap Chinese injection mold. When it arrived I had to marvel at how solidly built it is and how much it really does look like Elvis. There are actual strings on the guitar and his jacket is even flexible. All in all I give this thing five swivels of the hips.Thank ya. Thank ya, very much"
4,Portable Water Well Drilling Guide.,"Unlike the other reviews I found this book to be very informative. If you do not have the mechanical aptitude to understand this book, you should not build any rig, let alone try to drill a well. Yes this book is not very slick and there is not much to it but it contains a wealth of ideas, and good ideas are priceless. I am glad I found this book, plus ""The Water well trouble shooting Guide"", before I attempted to build a rig and drill my own well. I will have no problems building this rig from the plans, but more than that it gives me Ideas designing my own rig. If you are mechanically inclined and would like to drill your own well, start here. If this book had been professionally printed I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Victoria will never let you forget her...,"An engaging story, filled with wonderful period details of life in 17th century France, 18th century Spain, 19th century South Africa, and Gold Rush era San Francisco, Madonna of the Dark is a strong first novel. Victoria's journey to find her place among humanity is compelling drama, casting light into the dark soul of a vampiress searching for redemption. Victoria will never let the reader forget her."
2,Disappointing...,"...and i'm a Charlap fan. High hopes. But this recording, though given star treatment/art department/high gloss packaging with liner notes by playwright John Guare, is listless and uninspiring. Yes, nicely arranged and all that, but airless. It never breathes; it rarely swings...A couple new chord interpolations, one tempo surprise, one or two harmonic sparks -- way too few and far between to recommend. Pastel. Pleasant. But miles from jazz. If you want to hear Bernstein songs in a ""nice"" piano trio format with few challenging ideas, this is for you. Bill Evans is the standard for ""Lucky To Be Me"" and ""Some Other Time."" Oscar Peterson / Andre Previn for the ""West Side"" soundtrack. Much promise goes unfulfilled here..."
2,Not that good...,"The worst thing about this volleyball is inclusion of padding between bladder and leather covering. I am serious, I got tired of playing cheap volleyballs through the padding. It is as if you play ball with a pillow that covers it completely. Description at Amazon didn't describe any padding to be present in a volleyball construction."
2,"Not soft, iffy quality","After reading so many reviews about how quality and soft this ball is, I bought it and found it to be neither. Yes, if you are holding/touching the ball it feels soft, but that is neither here nor there. The test of how good a ball is is when you serve receive or try to dig a spike on it - high quality balls play lightly and don't sting/hurt while lower quality balls are ""heavier"" in play. This is definitely of the latter group. For casual play where there's no spiking involved, I guess this ball is okay, but it is nowhere close in quality to leather volleyballs used in competition. You get what you pay for. caveat emptor"
4,Welcome return to form,"This CD is very close in quality to ""Come From Heaven"". I had pretty much given up on them after the intervening albums. Still, as good as it is, you have to wonder where they go from here. I really have enough of the ultra cool side of trip hop on my play list now, would I really care about another repeat of this?"
3,Opening song included... They Lied Again!,I love this series for all it's moods and the sound track conveys them well. My gripe is that after buying both import CDs to the tune of over $70 I still don't have the opening song. BEWARE!!!
5,Informative and Fun,"Enjoying Wine with Mark PhillipsThis is a fun and informative way to learn about wine. Mark takes the mystery and snobbery out of wine tasting and promotes the enjoyment of wine in a casual setting. His video is pure entertainment, and you actually learn useful info at the same time.! Tips and tricks for everyone, from the novice to the experienced wine drinker. We've passed on some his tips to friends and they are impressed with our wine knowledge!!"
4,Death Rattle a clear winner !,Having read and reread all of Terry Johnston's series with Titus (Scratch)Bass.I love how the characters from his past keep popping up in his life. This installment is no exception as we get to say hello again to old friends from the past. This is a great story if you are familiar with the rest of the series.
4,Great research but a little violent,"Howdy folks. James Drury here. You might remember me from the Virginian. I don't read many of Terry Johnston's books, but I read this one and I want to leave you some of my thoughts. First, it's a shame to have Terry Johnston gone. He left us way too young, and cancer got another one. I do enjoy Johnston's stuff, but I have to say it's a little rough for my tastes. I read all of Kirby Jonas's novels on audio tape, and Kirby has a similar flair to Johnston as far as historical authenticity but without the bite of graphic violence, too much cussing, and other things just better left to the imagination. I know I sound like I'm slamming an author who was well-loved by many and always will be. I don't mean to slam him, and I do recommend this and all of his books if you are strong of stomach. For a milder, but still authentic taste of the West, read Kirby Jonas's books or listen to me read them on audio. Thanks for hearing me out."
4,Quality speed metal,"Unknown metal band resembles Metallica, Forced Entry in tempo and quality. All 3 of their releases are very solid and unique. An undiscovered, underground gem in the metal-world."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I was given this book by a co-worker/friend and was quite pleasantly surprised by this story. I am a voracious reader (and work in a bookstore) but have never read any romance before. I was worried that this book would be sappy and unrealistic. (If I want fantasy, Tolkien, Jordan, King, etc. will do just fine.) But I found the characters down to earth and enjoyable.The story was one of real people dealing with real problems.Now, as I've said, I'm not a ""romance reader"". But, in my opinion, you will thank yourself for the time spent with Faith, Gerard and Elijah."
5,Great likeness!,"This is a great kit at a great price,more fore the collector than to play with.I used superglue gel to secure most of the snap fit parts as they will come loose with a bump.I have had no problems since using glue and left the different arms as are to change them out if wanted.A great kit with great shipping."
4,joan sebastian is one of the best singers,joan sebastian is and will be like jose alfredo. He is and will be one of the best singers.
3,"'Lear' is MollyRingwald's Best Picture Post-""Pretty in Pink""","""King Lear"" is a fascinating film experience. Godard expresses passionate views of power vs. virtue, as appears on one of his many taglines, but what is most remarkable about this masterful picture is its sheer ability to inspire provocative thoughts of American society today. Released to video October 9, 1992 and classified PG by CARA, ""King Lear"" also features optimal sound (c/o of Dolby), as is appropriate and necessary for Godard's cinematic scope. Set against the backdrop of a Swiss resort, ""King Lear,"" indeed unfolds in ""post-apocalyptic""(Leonard Maltin), post-Chernobyl time, revealing a surreal picture of the world as we may come to see it. Misunderstood and underappreciated, ""King Lear"" is not to be missed, if only to see Brat Packer Molly Ringwald in her best picture since 1986's ""Pretty in Pink."""
1,"One of the most pretentious, unintelligible films ever made.","--and please keep in mind I am a fan of Jean-Luc Godard and of Shakespeare. This painfully dull and self-important film is a waste of time and talent. Instead, check out Godard at his peak in Vivre Sa Vie (My Life to Live), Breathless, or Un Femme Et Un Femme or try Laurience Olivier's late 1980's BBC version of King Lear or Orson Welles' version. This is perhaps my ""most unfavorite"" movie ever."
5,Beautiful Fan,We purchased this fan when doing a kitchen remodel which included new stainless steel fixures. We painted the cabinets white and replaced all cabinet hardward with brushed nickel. This fan fits in beautifully and is performing well thus far. Our contractor installed it and seemed to have no installation problems. He commented on how beautiful it was and we completely agree.
2,just bits n pieces,this was just pieces from other bits that any self-respecting Jerry Lewis fan already owns. most of it from the Colgate Comedy hour and trailers.
4,Limits of Corruption,"This is a great movie to get an idea about the events leading tothe arrest of Jack Abramoff played by Kevin Spacey. I ama fan of Kevin Spacey and most of his movies are interestingand funny, this one is no different.From the beginning of the movie we get a feel for thecharacter and the view point of Washington lobyists. They dohave more power than we would like, and at times it getsout of control and leads to excesses.Perhaps the point of this movie is this: if you are going tocheat, don't be greedy and overdo it for God's sake. It willbite you back. :)Any politics in this movie? You bet! But you will have to agreewith me that it is a darn good movie."
2,"""Casino Jack"" Goes Bust","Kevin Spacey gives a virtuoso performance in director George Hickenlooper's freewheeling look at flamboyant D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Unfortunately, the overlong ""Casino Jack"" (2010) suffers from a scattershot, flippant approach - wearing out its welcome before the halfway mark. Good support from Barry Pepper, Jon Lovitz and Kelly Preston cannot salvage the film's dramatic flatness."
5,Civic duty,"If you care about what is going on in our government, please see this film. It is awesome. Kevin Spacey does an awesome job!"
4,Puts a face on the name.,"I honestly hadn't bothered postulating about the corruption of congress and the influence of special interests. Who's to blame? Well...here's a guy you can blame, but it's almost guaranteed there are thousands of these guys floating around doing the same thing and not going to jail.So what's the lesson from this tale? Don't tell your gold-digger girlfriend your dirty dealings? That's what I got. I know it's a comedy but there's really nothing funny about the story despite the fact that all the characters are portrayed by comedians. Great movie though. It's funny that the law firm (traurig) faced no apparent sanctions for his actions which they implicitly rubber stamped.I won't get into it. It's too disheartening to expand on."
3,"I love Spacey, this movie was okay.","I think they made too much out of him being Jewish. I don't think being Jewish made him greedy, that's a stereotype that needs to die."
2,KINDA BORING!!,"This DVD is kinda boring. Great Actors but not enough detail to really see, or maybe just want' my style."
2,So So,"Movie could have stood alone without frequent, over the top, in your face ""bad republican!"" Hollywood banter...here and there, I get it, it's no secret what the agenda is, but throughout a whole movie? It reminds me of children that don't know when to stop repeating a joke. Toward the end of the movie Kevin Spacey's character (Jack Abramoff) addresses a letter to Bill Clinton that essentially asks democrat leaders to help him smear Bush. Although that did not come as a surprise to me, it is a very clear example of the bias in Hollywood. Tinseltown is so comfortable in the modern day left-media, which unfortunately is how the majority of people get their ideas, that there is no shame in admitting that this is a smear movie. Too bad Kevin, the movie was almost decent...another Verbal-like role would be great."
4,there all crooks democrats repubs and lobbyist,Iam not going to get in to details of the movie Kevin Spacey plays avery ggod part of Jack . Barry Pepper plays a weaseal in the movie and john Lovitz part who he was playing was a idiot. now people do you see why out goverment is crooked on both sides of the party lines. a good movie to watch thou and the end of this story about casino jack . Jack crime does'nt pay does it
3,Kevin Spacey delivers the goods as Abramoff,"Jack Abramoff (Spacey) and his partner Michael Scanlon (Pepper) are the subjects of this true story. A little over the top Jack Abramoff was a super lobbyist who found ways to scam everything and everybody especially the native Americans. Spacey is the glib, full of himself, ego maniacal Washington liar that everyone loves to hate. I wished the script was a little bit well written which would have made it a classic. Still not a bad watch. Three stars 12/17/2011"
2,This Release Has Been Made Obsolete By The Mill Creek Release,Given the rather uneven transfer quality of the 12 episodes in this collection and the fact that they are not in their original broadcast order (some are from Season #1 and some from Season #2) anyone really interested in watching the series should think about just purchasing the more recent Mill Creek release. It includes all 143 episodes (four seasons worth) in their original order and the discounted price is around $15.
2,Not tall enough,"The parts are thin plastic and cheaply made. Still, the tripod is reasonably sturdy when it's standing. Portability would be good, if you need that. The biggest problem is that it is not tall enough. If you're stringing a classical guitar (or any guitar that has a slotted headstock), you can't fit a string winder onto the machine heads. It will work okay if you position the headstock over the edge of the table/workbench. It's inexpensive and if you need a portable solution it will suffice. Otherwise, pass."
2,"Bad design - unstable, keeps falling over.","If you make any movement (beyond a tiny push) towards the headstock, the stand falls over.I have the Planet Waves NS capo, the Planet Waves string winder/cutter, and the Planet Waves Guitar Tools iPhone app, and they are all great. I don't know what happened with this Planet Waves product, but don't waste your money on it because it makes string changes and other guitar work a hassle because you're always worried the stand will tip over."
3,Planet Waves Guitar Headstand,Doesn't work too well for me when restringing. Just too light weight and moves around too freely. Had a hard time keeping my guitar in place when I started tightening the strings.
1,Not a full version,I think I was cheated. This e-book is not a full version. I brought e version because it was handy to read. The most important thing is to get a useful book. Not a summary which is least expensive. I rather to pay more to get a full version instead of a short e version. This is the first ebook I brought and I was so disappointed. I don't know I should consider a ebook as what I want or not.
3,A bit boring. There are much better number videos out there,"This video is ok, but they have way too much time showing babies and kids playing around with foam numbers. I mean, get on with it already!!! They have lots and lots of counting from 1 to 10. At the end of the video they say that counting goes beyond 10 and the kids count from 1 to 20 one time. My favorite part was near the end when the screen was full of jelly beans and the numbers are drawn among the jelly beans. This video is ok but, as I said at the beginning, there's just too much filler of kids playing. Brainy Baby 123's is bascially the very same video but improved upon a bit. They go beyond 10 and count things up to 20 and they still included the jelly beans on the table that I liked. I would recommend Brainy Baby 123's over this one. You do not need both because Brainy Baby has almost the exact same scenes as Baby's First Impressions but Brainy Baby also added a bit more animation and computer work. Please read my other reviews."
2,"Ya know, stuff.....","Well I didn't buy the CD because that would cost money so I just listen to the radio,,,,,,,anwho it sounded good on the radio so I taped it. I douubt the CD will sound much different.....just a cheep blokes opinion!"
4,XBox Phoenix Controller with Built-in XBox Live Communicator,The controller works well for On-line play. The head set provides clear voice output and the pad layout handles very nicely.
3,maddie,this book was cute and funny but not great at times it could be quite sad. but this book was good and i liked it. book basics: this book was about a girl and how a friend comes over and how mean the friend is to the girl. and then at the end how they like each other. and how they want to have a sleep over again.
3,Not that original,"So the Manhunter is a new woman superhero. This is a different creation from another DC character Manhunter, totally unrelated.The plot isn't too bad, top legal prosecutor loses case, dons red leotards, goes on a vigilante rampage and actually kills the villain. A little like Daredevil (but I digress). Anyway, the villain doesnt quite stay dead and is resurrected by another baddie who seems to be able to do tricks with his shadow. In between sorties, she has to deal with legal custody over her son.So another new superhero is launched but where is the hook? The artwork isn't bad but I think that the storyline has to deliver more to sustain real interest."
3,"Good, but out dated.","This book probably was a GREAT book in 2005 when it was published, but now it is just out of date. It hasn't been much use to me now. Online reviews of items I am interested in buying have been working great for me. I'm glad I only spent a few bucks on this book."
3,Editorial Review says it all,"I would have thought with Anna producing the album herself, and taking some time out of the music biz she would return with some music that would be very original. But she does manage to sound exactly like every other rock godess in the business. There are a few good songs, but the album as a whole is mediocre. Go with her work from her That Dog days over her solo work."
2,Anna By Anyone But Anna,"Anna's efforts are noted. I mean, she puts a lot of hard work into this solo album of hers. But, while her songs are undeniably catchy, nearly all of them leave you wondering, ""Haven't I heard this song before?"" As the editorial review (Laura Etling) above suggests, there are, indeed, traces (if not replicas)of other indie-rock women everywhere. It just gets old. Fast."
2,Anna Could Be Better,"Anna Waronker serves up a decent debut album, but it falls short of great. Mediocre production and rushed together songs make this collection very lackluster. Don't get me wrong, from the poppy ""Love Story"" all the way to the beautiful and melodic ""Goodbye"" ending, this album might catch your ear if you're a fan of That Dog. Do yourself a favor and buy the Eyeliners' ""Sealed With a Kiss"" instead."
2,Mainly a Roster,"While there are 2 or 3 very brief essays in this book, the vast majority of pages consist of a roster of women who helped run the Nazi concentration camps. I gave this item only 2 stars in part because the title should more accurately reflect this. If you want extensive narrative you'll need to look elsewhere."
1,Not worth the money,Not worth the money. The only thing you learn is how little is known about the women guards
2,The Camp Women,"I was disappointed with this book. Nowhere does the advertising for the book mention that its simply a roll call of names of those women who chose this life. I was expecting some information ABOUT the women themselves, before, during and after their service as camp guards. I agree with several other reviewers - it leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Easily assembled...,"This is a great product and I am very pleased with the ease of assembly. It's going to be great to not have to stake up and continually train tomatoe plants this year. I also like the idea of freeing up garden space, as well as keeping the lower tomatoes off of the ground."
1,Very overpriced!,I purchased this product from customer and found out Home Depot sells the same product for 7.99 without shipping.
4,Tomato Lover Fan,I enjoy home grown tomatoes that you raise yourself because they taste better than store bought ones by as they say a country mile and this new invention makes it easier to grow them than by planting them in the ground because one doesn't have to put stakes or cages around them which makes it nice to enjoy them.
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this for a gift, and totally regret it. great idea to grow veggies upside down when you open the box its a surprise. A plastic bag, metal brackets a sponge and that's it. Thought there would be at least the tomato seeds in there or something to start out growing but there isn't You can really make your own from stuff at home depot and would still be cheaper."
1,You can't fool Mother Nature!,"Before you buy one, perform this simple test.Lay a tomato seedling on its side.Water and fertilize normallySee how the plant grows up, at a right angle, towards the sun?That's what happens when you plant anything upside down. My plants exhausted themselves trying to grow in a 'U' shape and ended up with all sorts of problems; unlike the SAME SEEDLINGS PLANTED IN A GARDEN JUST 20 FEET AWAY!Notice the huge price decrease (from a couple of years ago) on these? That's because those of us who were fooled by the slick marketing would never buy another one."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money,"I tried it 3 times---got the same dismal results each time. It says to keep the roots watered frequently, but all that does is cause the water and soil to drain down the plant and slowly kill it!"
1,Doesn't work for green peppers or cucumbers either,"Okay, I liked the novelty of hanging 2 bags off my balcony. I don't like tomatoes and the ad seemed to say you can use for other vegetables. So I planted a green pepper plant and a cucumber vine. The cucumber vine would get a bunch of flowers, then the tiny little cucumbers, but they'd shrivel. Finally I got ONE 6"" cucumber before I noticed that the stem that goes through the hole and is surrounded by the piece of foam rubber was rotting. Too much water is held in that foam rubber. I had one small and one tiny green pepper before the stem starting rotting also.I'll try again next year, but grow the plants out the top instead of the bottom. That way, the stems can't rot.Definitely NOT worth the money spent. With plants, soil, and planters I figured my small crop came to $15 a piece for a cucumber and 2 small peppers.Save your money...either use a regular container, or plant outside in the real ground if you have the space."
2,Topsy Turvy,The product is too expensive. I could have gotten a better buy for the same product other places. I discovered after I placed my order.
1,Cheap and Ineffective,"Avoid this product. It is very cheap, mine didn't even last a year. The sunlight and water causes the bag to deteriorate which exposes the soil and plant roots. Besides that, getting your starter plant into the foam plug and bag is very difficult and usually results in damaged or broken branches. If you over water, the water drips down onto the leaves causing them to burn and die. This is a terrible product that does not do what it advertises. You will be very disappointed if you purchase this product, but at least you've been fore warned."
2,Faulty product,"Disappointed in these items. Have used topsy terveys for several years now but it was time to order new ones. I ordered three. First one broke immediately after hanging, second one had holes, third one had horrendous stitching. Had to rig all three. VERY disappointing!"
4,wonderful tomatoes,"I have used this product for three years. I have grown the most awesome tomatoes. The only complaint I have is that the sponge inside is good for only one year. I could have used the outside for several years if I could have purchased a new sponge. Having said that, I will buy this product every year because the tomatoes are soooo good."
1,Garbage!! Falls apart after one month,"One month after planting these dry rotted and fell to the ground. I used the recommended peat, etc but the sides are worthless. You won't enjoy the fast production if it's on the ground after a month. It's impossible to get red ripe tomatos in one month which is the life span of these poorly constructed planters. Pure garbage. Avoid like a plague. You'd be better suspending a flower pot with wire than use this product. Awful, waste of money. Loss of all my plants, fertilizer, peat soil, etc. Should be sold in a 99 cent store for 10 cents."
1,Tomato killer,First planting tomatoes looked good for ca 2weeks then colapsed and died.When i dumped the soil the ring holding plant was bright gold. I felt this might be an extruding oil. I soaked the product in soapy water for 1 hr rinsed well and replanted. My tomatoes are doing great.Please ask the maker to try growing tomatoes in product as sold.Felknor Ventures 82506 Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter
2,it will work,Had to take the pepper plant out of the planter it was not growing. As soon as I place the plant right side up in a pot it triple in size in three weeks. I will be up to my storage bags in peppers. I'll will try again next year with tomatos.
2,i tried to like it.....,"Alright, after seeing so many reviews on this product i decided to give it a shot. Plant did ok for a few weeks and was very close to stating to produce fruit. Thats when the trouble started i was out watering it one day and i noticed the leaves were wilted sure enough i had my first case of cutworms soon the plant was laying on the ground and im forced to replant. out of my 25 tomato plants this is the only one that has cutworms. not very impressed by this product."
3,Beware of vendors and shipping charges,"The product was as I expected, the packaging was great and delivery was on time BUT, the shipper (not Amazon) really overcharged me on shipping and handling charges. Carefully check S&H charges before placing an order thru Amazon's 3rd party vendors."
1,Don't waste your money,This does not work. The water drips down the stem of the plant and it causes it to rot. It also leaves a huge stain on the cement if you don't clean right away. Don't waste you money.
1,Worthless Tomato-Grower,"This gadget absolutely did not work for us...we followed instructions precisely, but it's just hanging out there tomato-free as decor (haha)...don't waste your $$ on this!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one this year. Below where I hung this thing, my neighbor was also growing tomatoes...it was pretty pathetic that my Topsy Turvy only yielded FOUR TOMATOES THE WHOLE SUMMER, while my neighbor's tomatoes ( planted in the ground) grew multiple tomatoes at a time. Embarassing and a waste of money."
1,Topy turvey is a joke,"Its August, topy turvy is all leaf and no tomatoes. Its heavy and requires constant watering. I should have known better to buy anything advertised on TV but after all I did buy it from Amazon. Well, off to the farm market to get some real tomatoes at $2 a lb."
4,durable,Very durable and easy to water.. I bought 3 of them.. Everyone else I gave one to had tomatoes but I did not but the plant grew huge.
4,new bag???,"I had a lot of success with the tt big bag planter as long as I kept it watered almost every day. I have used it for one year. I did not empty it until this year and I found the bag had rotted away on the bottom. I guess it can't take all that water and hot sun here in Florida. But I did enjoy the tomatoes and the flowers I planted in the top instead of using the cover. Now, big question, is it possible to replace just the bag since the model I have already has a stand. I guess it was the cadillac of tt's. Anyone know if I have to start over or can I just replace the bag. Thanks. Libby"
4,Topsy Turvy Tomato planter,I have had the item for about two weeks. So far the tomato plants have doubled in size. So far I am extremely pleased with the item. It is very easy to use.
2,Topsy Turvy plant gets bottom rot!,"Purchased 2 Topsy Turvy plants. Was excited after hanging and seeing the tomatoes start to grow. Didn't like the fact that I had to water twice a day and by the morning, the plant was drooping again. The tomatoes that have grown to the size of a 50cent piece keep getting the brown rot on the bottom. Not sure what to do as I have given them miracle grow and tomato plant food. Anyone have any suggestions. Oh, and the leaves are turning brown around the edges. Grrrrr.....not sure what else to do to keep them from getting the brown rot (or maybe it's blight?) They do have a rotten brown spot on the bottom of each new tomato. That's why I think it is brown rot. I am not liking these plants at all!!!"
1,Worst garden product I have ever bought,"Maybe these would be good in a more temperate climate, but we have had nothing but problems in Kansas. We had to replace 2 tomatoes because the stems sheared off at the base of the planter in spring storms. Now that it is the middle of summer I can't keep them moist. I water in the morning and by evening they are drooping. They seem to expend a great amount of energy trying to grow up like nature intended and they are a fraction of the size our tomato plants were when we planted them in the ground. Tonight I even found tomato worms on them which we never had in 6 years of growing them in the ground. Pest and disease resistant because they are off the ground was one of the big selling points. We are throwing these things away at the end of the season and going back to the ground!"
1,Waste of Money,"If you like vine ripened tomatoes, don't buy this gadget. As the plant grows, and it grows very well with the branches growing upright towards the sun, the weight of the tomatoes themselves will cause each branch to break, ruining every tomato on the branch. This will happen to each and every branch as the tomatoes grow in size and before they ripen. I bought this gadget last year and every tomato needed to be picked green off a broken branch. A total waste of money for vegetables, although it may be fine for flowers."
2,Anyone have pictures?,"If these are so great I wish someone would share their pictures. I have had lots of experience with these planters through work and have yet to see a tomato plant like they show in the pictures. My friends and family who have purchased this have been disappointed. Plants are not healthy and not a lot of tomatoes. I really wish it worked, I love the concept. If your only option is growing tomatoes in a hanging basket, go for it. Hopefully you'll have better luck like some of the other reviewers."
1,Don't waste your money - just buy a pot and potting soil,"I bought these topsy-turvy tomato planters as a gift to my son. He knows what he is doing - worked summers through high school and college at garden centers and his report was these planters are worthless. They were awkward to water and feed. The soil inside gets too hot and it ruins the root system. You need to get potting soil just the same as if you were potting in a regular pot - no advantage there. A waste of time, effort and money. He was disappointed and so was I."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I bought 2 to see how well it worked. I'm about halfway into the tomato season and the plants in the Topsy Turvy are about a 1/3 the size of the tomato plants that were planted in the ground. All the plants were from the same batch, planted the same day, and in the same location. It seems to dry out very quickly. Next year I'll try some different types of plants and see if I get better results."
3,Buck and a half at Big Lots!,I live in a townhome with one sunny patio/courtyard. So this might work. The price was right- $1.50 at Big Lots. Guess they're done marketing them. Will go with determinant varieties- thanks to the reviewer for that advice.Picked three stars just because you have to pick stars.
2,"Add Water,then more water and then some more.","This is a simple thought, Aply a tomato plant to the end of a funnal.then force water into the plant. The roots and soil are exsposed to the open air so it can't retain water. So you must add a gallon of water a DAY. this forces the water into the roots and intot he plant. The tomatos (If you get any ) turn out to be water balloons ."
2,not great,"hard to water, pain in the butt to keep tomatoes watered, and not too pretty to look at.I got rid of it after 6 months of growing tomatoes. They tasted okay, but it was so much work. I was literally watering it 3 times a day.The one good thing: my tomatoes were safe from those dastardly raccoons."
1,Just a fad,I dont know why i bought this but i did ! Actually i know why it was the marketing. Dont believe everyting you read or even see.Not under any conditions could you possibly get a harvest like they show never this needs constant watering and maintenance just not worth a second look its just a fad nothing more nothing less
5,Topsy Turvey,"Works Really well. We have a small patio and rather than clutter it up with a large potted plant we decided to try the Topsy Turvy. It is Great, no weeding and the partially enclosed top means you don't need to water as often.."
2,Tomato plants died....,"I bought 2 planters, one for tomatoes, one for zucchini. Zucchini plants (planted 2 in each) are still green, whether they are healthy is questionable. Tomatoe plants both died. I followed directions, but perhaps it got too much water...especially with all the rain we've been having in the northeast. Other tomato plants that are in pots are fine thou.Have to point out that when filled with dirt and water, the bags are extremely heavy. Extremely...and I have a bent heavy-duty shepard's hook to prove it!"
5,Tospy Turvey~I liked it!,"I bought 2 planters and put 2 tomato plants in each planter, as suggested; it seems to be working very well. They are heavy but they are growing well and that is all I can ask for!!"
1,"Just a gimmick, useless for the garden.","As has been mentioned by many others, this product is a waste of money. The collar will cut through the stems of plants, result...dead plants.The sun will heat up the soil in the bag, result....dead plants.The plants will become root bound (if they survive) in the small bag, result...no tomatoes.There is no way to keep this thing properly watered.I tried them for 2 summers for tomatoes, the few tomatoes that survived had Blossom End Rot (BER), and production was lousy.I gave mine away on Freecycle, and purchased some Earthboxes. MUCH better!!"
3,Topsy Tuvey and HEAVY,"The topsy turvey seem to work well, but one caution I would mention is that they get really heavy when filed with soil. I planned on hangiing them from some current hooks i had installed, but they were to heavy and ended up bending the hooks."
1,"BEWARE, PLANTS NOT INCLUDED","BEWARE!!!! None of these products contain the plants. It doesn't state that on the boxes, or in the ads. All you are getting is the tarp-like quality, plastic tube, a cable thing to hang it with and a foam rubber 'collar' to put around the plant that you have to supply. I can't get live plants where I live (an island in Alaska) so both the tomato and the strawberry planters were a waste of money for me. BTW, the strawberry planter takes 15 live plants!!! (Just in case you're shopping) I also located these same things in a store, and the boxes DO NOT STATE THAT THE PLANT IS NOT INCLUDED. So don't think you're geting a ready made garden - you're not! And none of their ads - on TV, or otherwise, state this fact. PLANTS NOT INCLUDED!!!!"
1,doesn't last more than 1 season,"I got one of these last year, the plant lived okay but I don't think I ever got any tomatoes off of it, I probably needed to water more. Well, anyway, it seemed like a good idea, but if you try it don't leave the bag out over the winter, I did and it just fell to shreds, and was not able to plant in it this year because the plastic fell apart and the dirt all fell out. Seems like a waste of money."
2,Please list all items needed,"Got the tomato what? There is a little green thing that I think has seeds in it, hope so cause there is no description to tell me... so now I need at least dirt and a very strong something to hang it on. I hope the tomatoes grow so all this will be worth it someday."
4,it works for what its worth,"So it is a little bit of a sloppy design but it works...i am not a fan of the white sponge cushion thing, and nor did i grow tomatoes in it...but it kept humidity and wathering was a breeze..."
4,topsy turvy,So far we like the product but the real proof will be this fall when we see our tomatoes blooming - so the jury is still out. Easy to follow directions for planting the tomato plant.
2,Fell Apart after one crop,"I actually had good luck growing things in these. They shredded after only one season of use. My green peppers, tomatoes and zukes were great. The whole thing depends are proper watering. I have to get a refund at Home Depot because they don't have them anymore. They can't hold up in the Florida sun. I found that my Earthbox was a better idea."
2,Really not worth it,"The plants grew just fine, but the tomatoes had very little flavor. I really think that plants grown in the ground have tastier tomatoes. All in all, it's just not worth it."
2,Un-happy Planter,"My expectations were just shot when I tried using the ""Topsy Turvy Upside Down Tomato Planter"", indoors. Everything that could go wrong went wrong, from putting the sponge piece in that holds the plant and soil, to water dripping out on the floor. Not very happy and I will never try this again from now own I will only plant tomatoes outdoors.Felknor Ventures 82506 Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter"
5,Just what I wanted,This was exactly what we wanted and a lot cheaper than other places. I would have worked great but the dogs ate the plants. :(
1,Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter made me frustrated,"I was not happy with this product. I found it hard to plant and even harder to water. My tomato plants in regular pots might not need watering because they had gotten enough from the rain, but the plant in the Topsy Turvy container couldn't get watered from the rain due to the small hole at the top of the container. It was very hard to check to see if it needed watering. The dirt was to far down inside the container and the hole at the top, to small to get my hand down in there to see if the dirt was dry. Despite my best efforts I got absolute NO tomatoes, not even blooms to grown on the plant in the Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter. A very big disappointment."
4,Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter,I bought 2 of these a month ago and planted 2 different varieties of tomatoes per the instructions included and so far so good. I did just see the same product at a Staples store for $9.99 and if you google Upside-Down Tomato Planter you can find instructions on making your own.
2,Good concept ... Bad Quality,"The idea is sound. I bought two last year, put tomato plants in them. They grew nicely, got nice tomatoes off them, but the containers done last more than one season, the materials wears out & starts cracking till finally they came crashing down on my porch. so now I have 2 dead tomato plants & dirt everywhere. A big mess to clean up.If they improve the quality so they will last several years, then I would say buy it, but since it doesn't last more than a couple months. I say it is not worth the buy."
2,"Tried it one season, won't again.","It did seem to help keep pests away until the tomato plants got tall enough to touch the ground. Then the caterpillars arrived. But because it's sitting out in the sun with no dirt around it, it dries out so fast that you have to water twice a day. I went away for three days, and when I got back my plants were dead. Cute idea, but it doesn't work very well."
1,Instructions on Amazon for product were incomplete,"I was quite disappointed in this product after it arrived. When I could finally look at the instructions it said you could not hang it from vinyl siding, but the biggest factor was the weight after if was filled with dirt. 60lbs. That's a lot of weight and not only that if a tomato plant did grow to muturity that's even more weigh. I think that should have been first and foremost in the product description.The price was a little steep for all that you got for your money. These are my reasons for returning the Topsy Turvy Planter."
2,It didn't work for me,"Topsy Turvy planter did not work for me. I bought and planted 6 tomato plants (1 in the Topsy turvy planter) and the other 5 in tub planters. The ones in the tub planters are flourishing and have buds. The one in the Topsy Turvy planter has died. Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the directions. I will try again with another type of vegie."
3,"Still trying, but optimistic","I really wish I could give this a 5. I wanted to try this so bad, but I have not had very good luck since I got it.The first tomato plant I tried was a well-established plant that after one day was basically dead. The leaves were black, wilted and crispy. I tried to revive it, with no luck. I tried it a second time around, using two smaller seedlings. Again, my plants wilted and died. They had plenty of moisture and sunlight so I think the only issue is the wind. However, my plants in the garden are holding up to the wind just fine.Hanging was a bit of a challenge, but I found a heavy duty shepherd's hook that held the weight just fine, and I could still move it to a new location if needed.If anyone has any suggestions PLEASE comment. I would love for this planter to work for me and am not giving up. My next idea is to rig up something to protect the plant a bit, perhaps a 2-liter bottle around it to block the wind somehow."
1,Not worth it,"save your money: too heavy to hang on any but the sturdiest of mounts, watering every day is not enough, plants try to grow up and then stalks twist and split from the weight as they get bigger. much better results in a plastic bucket: drill some holes in the bottom, fill with soil, plant seedling and watch it take off."
1,Sun's UV rays destroyed it,"The item only lasted one summer. The sun quickly degraded the green bag and it crumbled at the end of the summer, therefore it was garbage. I recommend making your own planter using a plastic pail (with metal handle) and a kitchen sponge. Homemade version will cost less than $1 and last much longer."
2,Too much work,"I own several of the Topsy Turvy planters and I would not buy them again. I am glad I bought them on clearance from a QVC outlet and didn't pay the price that they originally cost. I have followed the directions religiously, tried pampering the plants and ignoring the plants and everything in between and have had mediocre results at best. The only plants that really did well in these were a single cherry tomato plant and a rosemary plant. I tried peppers, squash, tomatoes, herbs of various sorts and a couple others and all the results were the same. Just not worth the price to get a few cherry tomatoes and herbs. And I do mean a few. Also, loading the potting soil into this bag makes it very heavy so you better have some help or a pulley system to hang it once it is loaded. I sure wish it had worked out!"
1,topsy turvy review,"I thought it was a hassle to plant the tomato plant in this planter without breaking the plant and spilling lots of soil. I was surprised how heavy this planter was when filled with plant and dirt because it's not a very big planter. The weight, however, was so heavy that it would not hang on a normal shepherds hook, so I had to hang it from a heavy hook in the joist beam on the eave. This made it so difficult to water, because it was out of reach. When I watered it, all the water drained out of the planter immediatly. The planter did keep the tomatoes up off the ground, but they were still accessible to birds and flying insects. I watered and fed the plants but they stayed scrawny and I did not get many tomatoes. Every topsy turvy planter in this town that I saw looked as bad as mine, so I didn't feel so badly. My tomatoes in the past have done much better when I planted them in large pots or raised beds than when I used this topsy turvy."
2,not large enough for tomatoes,"I love growing tomatoes - I grow so many that I have absolutely no space left with all of the beds and containers around. I thought topsy was going to revolutionize everything. I bought 2 - in one I planted a determinate yellow pear tomato and in the other I planted a small-medium sized tomato, isis candy.There was unquestionably not enough soil for these little guys to thrive. You need to leave at least a couple inches at the top for the plant to breathe - roots were overgrown and the poor thing needed to be watered 2 times a day to prevent wilting.I really wish I could give this a better rating, but I just can't - HOWEVER - it would probably be super for other apllications like certain flowers that don't require as much water."
4,used right -- works well,"I've used the upside-down planters for five years. First: follow the directions. The round sponges are to be spaced inside your soil to help keep it moist. Second: the planters will be heavy if you use soil, but they will not hold as much water if you use perlite, styrofoam peanuts, etc. It's a trade-off. Easier to handle means more watering. When fruiting, the plants need a lot of water: they're tomatoes.After some experimentation, we've found that cherry tomatoes work the best and hot peppers are even better: cherry bombs, cayennes. And peppers don't need as much water. We've worn out three planters, have two currently, and are about to order two more. If you get them, make sure they are full-sized. We've been using 15 inch long ones."
2,Impossible to hang,"This seems like a great, affordable product but I couldn't find anywhere/anything strong enough to hang the plant. The planter seems great, but then they try to sell you a $30 hanger and what choice to do have when everything other hanger bows over at the weight of this thing??"
5,Felknor Topsy Turvy Tomatoe Grower,"Great product with easy set up. Also, you will receive a link to Bill Felknor's website and his how to videos. This is a fun product. I recommend this product to novice and experienced gardeners alike. Amazon made a speedy delivery. I will purchase from them again."
3,Topsy Turvy Planter,"The product came as pictured .I thought for a simple bag with wires it was overpriced. With shipping ,Miracle Grow soil and the cost of two plants I have over $60 invested in these tomatoes.They better taste wonderful. So far, however,the tomatoes are doing great."
3,Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter,"Maybe I just don't have a green thumb, but my plant died the next day. It's also a little tricky to put the plant into the Topsy Turvy."
1,Pain in the Neck (and Back!),"I can't tell you whether or not this product grows tomatoes. All I can comment on is that if you purchase, you had better be certain that you have a very strong, secure place to hang it and good back. Once you fill the bag with dirt and water, it becomes extremely heavy. This is my fault, but I thought it would be ok on a shepherds hook... NOT! It immediately bent the hook over. It also needs to be placed very high which will make it very difficult to water. It would be nice if the manufacturer added all these little details to the outside of the box, so the buyer could beware. I'm dismantling mine and transferring the plant to a big pot. I definitely do not recommend!"
2,Upside down tomato planter,"Not to impressed with this product. The tomatoes start out fine, but eventually just start curving up and growing for the sky. My wife and mother mainly handled the growing part and they were not to impressed."
3,...Eh....,"Take too much work, constantly watering, I gave up. I'm sure if you're committed enough to water it daily, some times more, then it'll problem work. Glad I got it on sale."
1,Cranks and releases to much water!,My husband bought two of these for mothers day. We put a tomato in one and a sweet bell pepper in the other. One month later the plants have died and the topsy turvys are falling apart. te bottoms are cranking and have turned brown. Don't waste your money on these!
1,Incredibly disappointed.,"I have never written one of these reviews but I was so saddened by the results I just had to.My friends got me two of these as a birthday present. I was so very excited about it and followed the direction to the ""T"". As a result I killed two innocent tomato plants.The disk on the bottom that holds the plants choked them to death. They didn't have a chance.So I have some EarthBoxes and I will plant this weekend and see how that goes.If that doesn't work it is back to the age old, growin in the ground."
3,Package is marked Last Years Model,"Package is marked Last Years Model . .I never knew there was a never model until I saw the Infomercial after I received this.This years model has three holes on the sides and is larger than this one. Although this one may be less expensive and I might have bought it anyway, I think the seller has a duty to notify customers before they buy."
4,"So Far, So Good","Good quality - still early in growing season, so no harvest as of yet. I was pleasantly surprised how well these are made and are complete save for plants and growing medium. They even supplied hooks from which to hang them"
2,No tomatoes,"I bought a Topsy Turvy a week after I bought 2 large pots for tomatoes.Although I get flowers on the topsy turvy,non have turned into tomatoes. On the other hand my 2 potted plants of tomatoes are growing tomatoes like crazy. I water them the same and fertilize the same.The topsy turvy plant wants to turn up,and For me it is a waste of money next year I'll stick to the potted plants.Some reviews say they are great,more power to them."
5,Pleased with product,"The product came quickly and my Dad is growing a tomato plant, now we will need to see if there are tomatoes he can eat."
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought the strawberry one and the tomato one at the same time. The strawberry plants are actually starting to fruit now. My tomato plant is dead. They never mention anywhere that tomato plants are VERY picky. They get into shock from being transplanted, then hock from being hung upside-down, and if you're lucky your plant wont be dead. Just do it the regular way, it'll save you money and frustration."
1,Tomato plant didn't live one day,"We had thought about one of these for some time, but the reviews were not good. My wife finally got one. Finding a place to hang it so it could get full sun was tricky. We followed the directions exactly. I added Miracle Grow and only used Miracle Grow potting soil. I got a goood plant with a tall, firm, straight stalk. Everything was good and wet. In the morning the plant was dead. I don't know what dit it in. I will try one more time."
4,topsy turvy tomato whiz,"I appreciated all of the customer reviews on this item. That is what got me to purchase one for myself. I am an agreement with the positive reviewers - I enjoyed this new way to produce my favorite fruit/vegetable. I still garden in the ground, but will be buying more of these topsy turvy planters to grow peppers as one of your reviewers did. Thanks, Amazon!Amy Nymark"
2,seems convenient but,"Yah I mean, it seems perfect and convenient, but realistically it takes way too much effort to water this thing AND have it indoors. It claims to be impossible to over-water it, but that is because there area a bunch of holes in the bottom through which water drains. Sounds great if you are outdoors, right? Well, I bought this because I don't have a yard or outdoor space of any kind. Whenever you water it (even if a small amount) it drips for several hours afterwards. I had to place a big bowl underneath every time I watered it. What kind of convenience is that? I think it's just as convenient to grow something conventionally and place some stakes in the pot or something."
2,"Science says ""Thumbs Down""","I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours. We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness. They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants. I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down"
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of these last spring and planted my tomato plants as instructed. I kept a hose nearby just for the purpose of watering these very thirsty planters. Neither plant yielded much of a crop. When I went to take the planters down after the season I discovered that both planters had begun to decompose after only one season's use! What a waste of money, since I didn't even get a great crop from them. I am going to make my own from some 5 gal buckets. Now that will hold up."
2,waste of money plants do not produce much fruit,These things are a waste of money. my mom used these to grow cherry tomatoes regular tomatoes green peppers and cucumbers. well the only thing that produced the most was the cherry tomatoes sense she put 2 in the planter. The regular tomatoes produced maybe 5 at the most and some are falling off. The green peppers 1 grew early and only now are the rest growing. the cucumbers did not do well. only 2 grew full size the others did not get to full size. The plants want to grow upwards toward the sun like there supposed to. we will only use these again for cherry tomatoes. the rest will be planted in the ground like your supposed too.
2,Not Water Friendly!,"I live in a dry part of the country and I would not recommend this. My plants required very frequent watering. Even when I watered my tomato plants twice what I normally did they were very dry. I eventually gave up and lost the 'Battle of the Tomatoes'. Living in a region where water is very precious, I see this product as very wasteful! When fully watered the the Topsy Turvy is very heavy. Overall I would rather have saved my money!"
2,I'll try again next spring.,"I bought four of these. Only one of the seedlings is still alive-barely. It wasn't difficult to get the seedlings through the opening, although I didn't use the foam thing that came with it. It was difficult to get the planters up once they were filled, and water runs through it pretty quickly. Other reviewers suggested poking holes at the bottom of a halved milk jug-definitely works. But time will tell if I'll get any fruit out of my tomato seedling. I'll update later if I do."
2,Heavy and hard to handle,"Althought the topsy turvy is very unique it is very heavy once just half filled with soil. A plant holder that is displayed in many ads will not hold the weight of these Tobsy Turvys. THEY ARE VERY HEAVY! I had to buy chains to hang my topsy turvys on my clothes line poles that are cemented into the ground. It would takes a 4x4 to insert the hooks into that come with the planter in order to hold the planter with the soil and plant because of the weight. Once the weight problem was solved I became anxious to see how the plants produce, that is yet to be seen because it is just the first of May. I will write again late summer about how my tomato plants produce.Good Luck to all, just remember these suckers are HEAVY once filled."
3,BE READY TO DO VERY HEAVY LIFTING ONCE THIS ITEM IS FILLED WITH SOIL+WATER!,"I purchased 4 of these tomato planters because I wanted to grow my own tomatoes for the first time. This item is great if you buy it from ANYBODY but the original website. The fees will eat you alive!This planter gets extremely heavy once you fill it with soil and water. Since tomatoes need a lot of sunshine, be ready to water this plant at least once daily. If you don't water this item on a daily basis, your plant will dry very quick.[...].[...]"
1,1 STAR IS TOO MANY,"i bought four. Tried planting them over and over again, plants just rot and die. I followed directions word by word and still everything dies. I am in the process of getting my money back. What a SCAM!"
1,Everything was not included...,"I was not happy when I opened the package, it only included the Topsy Turvy Bag with no stand like what is shown on the TV commercial."
1,Tried it and think it is a waste of resources,"The Topsy Turvy is not attractive. It is a green plastic bag. It was VERY difficult to load. I am very concerned about the success of this endeavor due to the weight of the full bag. Maybe it will produce a lot of tomatoes...I am hopeful. I am disappointed thus far as I was very excited about using the upside down concept. I could not recommend this to anyone at this point.Addendum Fall 2010This product is a waste of money. I threw it away after one season. Not only was it ugly, extremely difficult to load, very(especially after watering)heavy,and awkward to water... the plant grew poorly in full sun and produced very few tomatoes. I would advise that no one should purchase this product as I was very disappointed with it."
1,"Warning Does NOT come with plants, this is just a planter","I expected this to come with seeds or something to plant, but NO just the holder. Hope this POS works"
2,Missing Link?,How can you sell Topsy-Turvy Tomato Planters without offering support poles strong enough to hold the upside-down plants? And where are the disclaimers in the ads that say the planters need almost constant watering or that you need top-shelf (and expensive) potting soil (preferably from Canada) to come close to the bold predictions of 30 pounds of tomatoes per planter? I will be happy to file another review after the summer.
1,Up Side Down Thinking,"I only bought two of the topsy turvys' because they were 2 for $5. Just a whim but what a waste. It is just not natural to strangulate a plant stem, water goes to the stem and roots grow to the water plus the foam ring slit. All strangulation. On top of that when you use the plant food and then water the plant food trickles through and burns the leaf and stem. How did this ever get off the ground so to speak!!!!!!!!!!!! Seems like a government idea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,TOMATO PLANTER,SAVE YOUR MONEY - I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS - TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR SO LITTLE FRUIT. Plus mine came apart and couldn't use the next year. THAT'S a big would NOT RECOMMEND -- great idea but you could buy a plastic container and punch holes and be better off.
1,Not for other veggies!,"I purchased the Topsy Turvy for my husband to plant tomatoes. The box says it is great for green peppers and cucumbers also, so I ordered 2 more. Unfortunately, both the green pepper and cucumber plant stems were strangled; the plants died and the stems fell to the ground within weeks. We hope the tomatoes make it!"
4,The Upside-Down Tomato Planter,We have not had good luck with tomatoes in the past mainly due to bugs. But the plants in the Felknor Ventures 82506 Topsy Turvy Upside-Down Tomato Planter are healthy and happy and there are lots of flowers and baby tomatoes on the vine. It looks like we are going to have a bumper crop thanks to this ingenious device!
1,"Junk, gimicky, and totally disappointing.","This is a perfect example of great marketing. This product is a horrid piece of trash that, at any price over free, is not worth the money. However, from a marketing point of view these have been a tremendous success. As a gardener, don't be wowed by this. It's not worth the money.I followed the directions exactly. The result was a scant few tomatoes and a lot of work. These things need daily, if not more, watering. Because there is very little soil, you will soon run into nutrition issues with this device. The vessel or plastic side material is trash. Mine ripped before the summer was over. Further, they are extremely heavy when filled with soil and water. Perhaps at least 50 or 60 pounds if not more. This will limit what you hang it on. I did not have much luck finding anything that could hold up. Hanging this dirt anchor on your house is out of the question.This product is junk. You can do better with a pot and dirt. Avoid."
2,be careful,"Living on a small urgan lot, we bought a couple of these to grow more tomato plants than we are able to the traditional way. Although the upside down plants are growing right next to the plants in soil, they are only about 1/4 as large and have produced only minimal small fruit. They are probably getting too much direct sunlight. Although this is normally not a problem, the roots are getting baked. They need to be generously watered every day. If this is your only option for space to grow tomatoes, it can work OK with the right placement and TLC. If you have room to grow tomatoes the traditional way, this is not the best option."
2,Requires MUCH daily care & Luck,"I'm an avid gardener and would only suggest that folks that have lots of tinkering time on their hands consider this item. The photos look great, but remember that the weight of the tomato plant (and it's soil + water) is tough on the bag and supporting hook (I used an eye bolt through a 2 x 8).Please consider growing only tiny patio tomato's as they weigh less.Use in a wind free area and be ready to supply an additional drip watering system.Remember, If this method was so easy, then Commercial growers would be doing it..."
2,Disappointing for anyone serious about growing vegetables,"This is little more than a novelty item. I bought two and really wanted to like the product. I followed all the instructions, growing tomatoes in one and bell peppers in the other. I'm a space starved vegetable gardener, and really hoped that this product would help me out, but it just never delivered.The tomatoes (and there weren't many) were all runts, meanwhile the same variety of tomato is growing 20 feet away in the ground surrounded by a conventional cage and I'm getting dozens of huge tomatoes. Same thing with the peppers. I live in Southern California, and used these over the summer. I spent most of my time dumping copious amounts of water and it still dried out too fast. There may be other vegetables that do grow in this thing but I did not have a good experience and threw them away a month or so ago. A shame."
2,What The?,"I find it hard to believe that all these reviews are from legit customers... This product was not delivere]ed anywhere near on time, and was not delivered as advertised. Don't think you are getting any ""system"" here, you are just getting a bag for your plants. No seeds, no dirt, nothing to hang it on (whch is no small issue since it weighs a lot with the plants inside the bag). It's an interesting idea, but don't be fooled by commericals or ads into thinking you are getting more than you are, a sack..."
1,Two thumbs down,"I followed the directions, but my tomato plant quickly withered. I watered it a ton throughout the day for about 5 days- slowly, making sure the water had time to absorb all the way through. I finally gave up the battle and decided to start over fresh with one in a pot. I had to have my husband take it down for me because it was too heavy, which was frustrating. In retrospect, I think my plant may have been too big when it was planted- I don't recall reading this anywhere but in reviews. Oh yes, and it leaves an ugly mess underneath where the water drips."
5,no more bugs!!,"I love this for my balcony garden! I had wonderful tomatoes this year. my only small problem was that I let the tomato plant get a little big before I planted it in the topsy turvy.. so it was a little difficult to do it without damaging the plant, but my very patient husband took over when I became frustrated. Also, I didnt take into consideration that we had only a 9ft. area to hang it from so I had to get a step stool every time I needed to water it.. which was a lot considering it was under the deck of our neighbors who live above us and didnt really get any of the water when it rained. But that is just me whining.. I really do love this little creation and plan on getting more next year to for different plants..maybe eggplant, peppers, blueberries.."
5,Perfect,"I love these, they are a great way to plant some veggies if you dont have a lot of yard =) And this new design is even better than the old!"
2,Not much luck,I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.
5,Great,This product is working great. It doesn't take up a lot of room and we don't have to worry about any critters eating the tomatoes.
4,it's something to see!!,"so far our tomatos plants are growing good & have blossoms. we are exspecting a bumper ""topsy"" crop this year."
3,A British Perspective of Partition of India,"The upside is that it is a good book for someone trying to find a non-Indian, non-Pakistani version of the reasons and account of partition. The downside is that it is somewhat pro-British, which considering the fact that the author was a senior British official during the Raj, shouldn't be surprising. On the whole a good book for someone trying to find out more about partition. However, my choice for the best book in this category would still be ""Freedom at Midnight""."
1,negative,"I ordered the 6th edition and received the 5th edition. However, delivery was fast, but i still have to return the book. WOuld recommand everyone to ask a question to the seller before ordering the book just to make sure that the book YOU need is the one Seller is selling! ! It sucks when you receive a wrong book and have a quiz next day in the class ! !"
3,Received replacement,"Didn't receive the Hawk RFT RC Electric Oudoor Remote Control Helicopter, wasent the Dragon Fly as a replacement which works but doesn't have very accurate control due to it being a two channel."
2,Ok if you are very hard pressed for time,"Nthing comes close to making dosai the traditional way, soak rice/dal, grind, let ferment, let it rise and make it. These don't come that good as traditional, but nevertheless they are dosai. I tried once and will not go back. I prefer a restaurant or making at home."
3,Not as cozy as anticipated,"This was the first pair of Uggs I've ever purchased. I was disappointed in the comfort - the footbed was hard. Granted, every person's feet are different but I've tried the Ugg boots and they are far more comfortable than the Tasman."
2,Disappointing design,"Although the material quality is very good, the design, unfortunately, is not. I heeded other reviewers comment regarding going up in size but the heel of the foot does not ""work"" or feel comfortable when walking. As such, immediately returned. What a disappointment !"
3,a+,"My daughter loves them, she is happy I am happy, the bottoms wear out a bit quicken than I would like, but thats with all shoes I suppose"
5,Insanely comfortable!,"I can't believe how comfortable these these slippers are. I got them today in the mail and tried them on immediately. At first I thought the slipper looked a little bulky up at the toe, but I couldn't bring myself to take them off. This is my first pair of Uggs and I am definitely glad I made the purchase. I have been wearing them all day and will be wearing them as often as possible! The sole is quite thick and sturdy and will last a long time. My husband has a pair of the men's and also has a hard time taking them off because they are so comfortable. He wears them everywhere as normal shoes and they are holding up just fine. My grandmother also has these same slippers (she was the one who recommended them!) and loves them. She has a high arch and cut a little slit in the front for more room to get her foot in and out. I would definitely recommend these slippers if you are looking for something durable and extremely comfortable."
5,Perfect,"They were just what we were looking for in a slide on shoe, they are comfortable and are made very durable."
4,stiff,This is a real nice shoe/slipper. However just know that it will take awhile to break it in as it is real stiff. Great color.
4,Nice shoe,"This Ugg shoe/slipper was everything that my daughter expected. The only thing was the initial shipment, I received 2 right shoes, but the Seller, handled it so professional. They immediately corrected and sent the correct shoes without asking for the incorrect shoes in return. I would purchase from Villa Shoes again"
4,"Lasting Quality, High Price","$85 is a lot to pay for slippers, but I finally decided it was worth it because my first pair lasted for 10 years. I did have to stitch up the toes one time over the years, but they remain functional (if no longer stylish) even after nearly a decade. Now I'm sporting a new pair. I hope they will last a long."
2,UGG Australia really UGG China,"This is way too much money for a product made in China. They likely pay $5 tops to manufacture. I ""assumed"" UGG Australia meant there was pride of manufacturing involved. Do yourself a favor, save your hard earned money."
2,slippers not shoes,Bought them for my 12 yr old daughter but she is not allowed to wear them at her school because they are slippers not shoes. I have seen a few people at the mall etc. wearing them but they really dont look like shoes. They look like slippers.
1,need a return authorization,will not order on line with amazon again. No way to return mdse. Not dealing directly with one mfg. Not happy. Shoes run small not indicated when purchasing. Not true to size.
3,run small,"They are great slippers but run small so I had to order a size up. Otherwise no problem, love the hard soles, cushy insides and the color"
3,These are UGGS so of course they're great! HOWEVER!!!,"If you happen to have a HIGH INSTEP which unfortunately I do, they will not work. Very uncomfortable and tight at the top where your instep is at the middle of the seam. My husband was going to take them and have them stretched, but he was unable to do so. The shoe repair guy said that because of the SEAM down the middle, would not be a good idea to try and stretch them. Anyways, I was disappointed they were not a good fit, but Amazon is great for being able to return items. But I admire small feet that don't have the high instep problem, and therefore able to buy regular shoes."
4,Great Product,It seems to be a great product and just what we needed. We purchased this item because it received good industry reviews and was priced right.
1,"Lotsa paper, little information","Taking way more paper than needed to convey their information, the authors do a poor job of describing the way of eating they propose. They leave too many questions unanswered (how much water is recommended, role of legumes in the diet, role of vitamin supplements, use of substitute sweeteners, use of substitute fats, etc.). Their too-drippingly-cute-for-words poems rapidly become skip-overs in the reading (as is much of the other content) as one searches for the diet guidelines proposed (which are never conveniently summarized). The gist? Essentially the food pyramid with more fruits and vegetables (five servings of each instead of 5 total). Unless you really prefer to have someone speak to you as if you're in the fourth grade, I recommend conducting an Amazon search on the DASH diet and trying another book."
4,"One of a Kind, but a little sparse","This collection of essays does what has long needed to be done: codifying the theory and method for a cognitive archaeology. Unfortunately, it's not as comprehensive as I might have liked, since it is, after all, a collection of essays. It's a good beginning, but continued scholarship on the subject will hopefully beget greater volumes. I still recommend this highly for anyone interested in the subject matter, since few other books of its kind exist."
5,Epic,"Exploring the relationships between natives, tourists, and nature, Walcott moves beyond just our relationships with one another to create this modern epic. Evocative of the Iliad with its battles between Hector and Achille over the yellow-dressed Helen, Omeros moves beyond just the interactions of the natives to greater themes.There are many exciting parts to the poem: the beauty of the language, the themes, that it was only on the second time reading Omeros that I realized it rhymed, such is the seeming effortlessness with which Walcott writes. It is a modern epic for the way it is able to really explore human relationships with one another, with the trees, with people invading our indigenous societies.Walcott manages to focus on a few people in spite of the seemingly huge scope of Omeros, and this makes the book much more deeply enjoyable. I recommend it heartily."
5,Great Volcano for the money,"My 4 year old son is obsessed with volcanoes and asked for this for a year every time he saw it in a magazine. He loved building it with his dad and watching it erupt over and over. We are not sure where to store it, since it is a bit big. But, other than that we were very happy with it."
3,Simple volcano,My son loves dinosaurs and loves this volcano. He has it with his dinosaur collection. It is a pretty simple toy may up of paper mache. It is a little flimsy and don't expect it to last long.
5,great album,Got this to replace a worn out vinyl recording of The Big Chill soundtrack. Love that it's got the additional 10 songs.
5,FABULOUS!,"If you are a ""child of the sixties"" or simply a lover of sixties music, this CD is for you! I work in retail and we are permitted to play personal CDs at work. All my coworkers love this CD as well. Go for it! You will not be sorry!The Big Chill - Deluxe Edition"
1,Great songs - HORRIBLE sound quality,"As one who has several of the tracks on albums by the artists, I can attest that the sound quality of the two discs being horrible. The first disc is beyond horrible and approaching abysmal or even offensive. Please do not waste your money if you want to play these discs on any stereophonic system above a ""boom box."""
4,Lady Chatterley,"A very beautiful interpretation, with a slow, emotionally honest exposition. Makes one feel as though looking at Lawrence's novel quite afresh, without all its encrusted history of sweaty-palm controversies. It is situated very convincingly in its era (1920s), at a point of openiing up against the sexual restrictions of its class, society and period. It shows the slow discovery of the possibilities of reaching for sexual passion and physical satisfaction - especially for the woman (after all, the title of the movie is: ""Lady Chatterley"", without the ""lover"" of the book.). This is done without any prudish voyeuristic clichés, or romanticized imageries, yet, at the same time, fully engaging with all the power of sex and sensuality, and not avoiding looking at man's and woman's nudity. The acting is wonderfully restrained and subtle, mostly through looks, gestures, and the characters' postures and movements."
3,Love and class structure,"D.H. Lawrence is known for his sensual (if not scandalous) novels of forbidden love, infatuation and attraction. ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" was one of the books that in its time was considered scandalous. I was expecting that French director will produce a film that is sensual and erotic. However, the film feels strained. It is almost unnatural when French actors have English names. Film editing feels forced and choppy at time. Prolonged 120 minute production is not helping either. We do manage to like the two seemingly unlikely lovers who manage to build their relationship well beyond their oposing social standings. We like them in the purity of their relationship that has no prejudices and to both of them comes natural as the surrounding of forrests, birds, rain and flowers. Theirs is a romantic love that builds slowly but steadily. Both are starved for affection and love that changes them both in the ways neither one of them expected it."
2,"Good story, but too slow and languid","Not that I mind a film with a slow pace, but this one has no reason to proceed so slowly. There are also far too many long, long, long tracking shots which add nothing to the story and are not needed at all. They probably could have chopped out at least an hour of the film just by shortening these.It's also disconcerting to hear everything in French when it takes place in England and these are all supposed to be English people.I must also say that Lady C's attraction to Parkin is a bit puzzling, since he really seems more like an oaf than anything. Puzzling indeed."
2,boring,I feel the film made a point that when a woman dont get her needs meet she will get another and guys will to . I thot the intimate scenes could have been more than they were and was disappointed in the movie . I wouldnt recommend it at all .
1,Terrible movie,"This movie is THE worst movie I ever had to sit through. It's horribly long, boring as hell, the story goes nowhere. The actress is pretty good (after all she won the 2007 Cesar for Best Actress) and that's the only positive aspect of this movie. Avoid it!!!!"
5,Very well done!,"We very much enjoyed this movie. As others have said, it seemed to follow the original story quite closely. The main characters were quite believeable, and the setting seemed right out of the book. Picture and sound quality were very good. Finally a version not just reduced to a sex flick. If that's what you are looking for there are other versions available."
4,Lush and Romantic,"It's pleasant the the lovers aren't beautiful models who can't act, and that their attraction to each other appears to be natural. The story is, after all, a simple tale of sexual frustration and fulfillment. The cast carries it off pretty well."
4,Brazilian soul served well done,"From what I've read, Patricia Marx is no stranger to music. She was apparently a pop star in her native Brazil in the 80's and 90s. This effort, self titled Patricia Marx, is on the money. The music is more neo soulish rather than pop, and her voice is reminiscent of Aaliyah. Marx sings in both English and Portuguese. All in all, it's a well done, laid back CD; something to listen to on a rainy night. Key tracks, Menino, New Life, Burning Luv (my fav!), and Lotta Luck."
1,Will not work in humidity,"Unlike most salt pigs, this product is glazed on the interior. This does not keep the coarse salt dry and if you live in any humidity at all, your salt will clump. Buy an unglazed interior style."
5,A Great Book On London Colts,"This Is a Great Book on a Subject near and dear to my Heart, as I own my Great Great Grandfather's London Colt In .450 Boxerand Love it I Keep it in a wood Canvas Covered Box, and Had My Gunsmith Take My Cimmaron Single Action Army and I use that at the Range as My Real London Colt I Never shoot Thank You C.Kenneth Moore and Amazon"
2,It's more like Luggage than a tote bag,"I just returned this to Amazon. I bought this for my wife, and this thing is HUGE. The ""Cartier"" logos don't appear anywhere except on a small zipper and inside the bag. So it looks like any other bag, but costs $700-800!Again, the bag is HUGE. You cannot use this to go out to a nice restaurant or even shopping. This would make a nice diaper bag, but not at $800. Oh well...."
1,Don't buy from seller Music123,"Never received product. NO communication! Amazon needs to remove this vendor. BEWARE of seller Music123Oh well, live and learn."
5,good stand,It is hard to write a review for something so simple. I'll make this short. the stand holds my guitar. It works. Suprise suprise.
1,awful! If I could give it 0 stars I would!!,"I had to use this book for 2 semesters. Well, ""use"" is not even correct, since I barely looked at it; that's how good it was. I tried reading through it for the first semester, but it was no use. There's no cohesiveness to it at all, and it's very frustrating that there isn't a working index. I gave up trying to make any sense out it. Our professor used it for his outlines for his lectures and took pictures and graphs out of it. Other than that, didn't really use it.Next semester, my professor used the problems at the end of each chapter to prepare for quizzes and tests, and that was about it.I haven't read any more of the book since the first couple weeks of the first semester. Did I need it to succeed in class? No.It's a terrible book, and I am glad that I will never need to use it again.I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this book. Amazon marketplace for the win!"
1,worst textbook ever,"This ""project"" of the ACS can barely qualify as a textbook. It is full of errors and inconsistent. The book does not read well at all. The examples are very poor. They explain a lot of concepts through experiments that you are suppose to conduct. But most people don't have the tools or the time to perform the experiments and they do not even offer to explain what would have happened and what you should have learned.I have to use this textbook for my college general chemistry class. Everyone in my class just uses the book by Raymond Chang in conjunction with this one.If you are teaching chemistry, please do not torture you students by selecting this text for your class. If you are a student, I'd suggest using the Chang book."
1,yikes,"this book is the devil. i prefer my chemistry spoon fed. a book were you could ""go through the motions"" and ""get by"" would be just fine unless you actually CARE about chemistry which i am assuming is a rather small percentage of the population"
5,Flashback to childhood,"As a child during the time these came out, I found this brought me right back to my childhood. This flashback was so wonderful for me that I had to have my children watch it and now they understand the magic of H. R. Pufnstuf. They, like myself, can not wait until the next video is released."
4,Great for the money: true 5.1,"These headphones deliver true 5.1 surround sound, just as advertized. As mentioned in another review, the unit does react to cell phone signals, just as I've heard other speakers do. It would seem that the amplifier unit is not properly shielded, however, I am no expert. Keep your cellphone at a safe distance and you should be ok.However, this aside, you will definately be enveloped by high quality sound. This is great for playing games and watching DVDs. You won't want to go back to 2.1 or any other non-surround headphone setup. Recommended."
4,Great price great product,"For fifty bucks you cant beat these headphones,There is a little white noise, but when you playing Halo2 with these on with the volume up you cant hear anything but the game.The simulated surround is really good as with the base, I found myself being really scared at times playeing halo 2 because of all the surround sound I was not use to hearing.Also works well with the movies. The unit comes with all adaptions for any kind of hook up required.Im sure there are better models out there if you want to pay the money. For the price you cant beat these.Im going to be buying two more sets for my brothers so we dont wake up the kids when were haveing our halo partys."
4,Fine product for the price.,"I've had a pair of these for over a year. I use them constantly, and I haven't been less than pleased with them at any time. I'm planning on ordering a second pair to use with my home theater system."
3,"Not bad for under $40, but you'll need a few extras","Please consider the following:- You'll need to connect the unit to an amp that pumps out 5.1 if you want to hear Halo 2 or GT4 in all their glory. Otherwise it's stereo to ""simulated 5.1""- Your amp needs to have RCA outputs to connect the headphone base unit. I only had speaker outputs on mine, so had the fun of stripping the cables and attaching them to the speaker outputs to get it to work. Painful- Get some RF protection. I've encased the base unit is a wire mesh pen cage from Staples. It cuts down the airwaves that the unit picks up- Connect the unit's power supply to a clean power source and that'll decrease the background hiss tooAll in all you get what you pay for, a budget priced 5.1 surround sound system. If you have the required add-ons, and can put up with a moderate amount of hiss then you'll be well satified."
4,Cheap Gaming headphones with all the right moves,A lot of people say they hear a white noise in the backround...well I do to and to be honest it really doesn't get in the way of your gaming at all once you have the volume up.The two things that amazed me were the awesome sound and bass (when I blow something up in a game it shakes my head) and the other awesome feature is that it comes with all the gear so that if you already have a speaker setup for surround sound you can connect both the headphones and the speakers at the same time from up front and you probably wont even have to go behind your computer to do it - i dont understand why other headsets dont use this feature.A must have at the $$ for gaming!
3,"good, not great","the headphones themselves are not good. BUT( a big but) the 5.1 sound processer is amazing. the 5.1 processor is like an external 5.1 sound card, great for laptops because i can hook up my 5.1 speakers to my laptop through just a headphone jack. the 5.1 processor is worth the 40 bucks even without the headphones. if you arre worried about being able to hook these up to what you have, that being a xbox, computer, ipod, whatever, there is an adapter cable in the box for about anything you can think of."
4,Durable and good value,Bought the Headphone for my hubby for everyday use on computer. He likes it and it's been couple years and is still working well. the extra part that came with didn't work much the the headphone itself is good. Good price for the product.
3,Not bad....,"I bought these headphones a couple of weeks ago and I have used them a few times. I bought headphones because my husband always complained about how loud I played my music on the computer while he was wathing tv. These didnt solve the problem. He can hear them from 15feet away. It's bulky but meets up to the promise of bass response. It's alot of wires to deal with and wasnt what I expected. If you want to listen to your music loud and dont want other people in the room to hear what your listening to, these are not the headphones for you."
2,This is for use with a surround sound capable PC only!,"I bought this because is says ""Engineered for use with XBOX"". This is false. it can not connect via toslink cable to an XBOX or any other DTS devise with optical out. To deliver true 5.1 surron=und sound you can ONLY connect it to a devise with descreet 5.1 channel outputs. The claim that it is ""Engineered"" to work with XBOX, Playstation 2, etc. is only true for Stereo. EVERY headphone fits that description. This product is VERY misleading."
1,Not worth it,"Let me start off saying that these may work fine with a 5.1 soundcard on a PC, but they do not work with a MAC like it is said. There is no indication as to what these use for hookups. They do not include optical, and the only way to use them with my Macbook Pro was as regular headphones, or do the simulated 5.1 sound. I tried both and could not tell the difference. The one thing I did notice is that when using the simulated 5.1 the most I could hear was static and clicking.Very disappointing, but I guess if you want good surround sound you should go with a real system."
1,Worthless,"After only 3 months of occasionally using the headphones for Doom 3, one of the right side speakers began constantly giving a static noise when any audio was played, making them unusable unless you like to hear digital scratching all the time. This is not the constant white noise described by the other reviewer. Not to mention that there is absolutely no support for the equipment through the companies web site except a voicemail I have yet to be called back on.BLAH"
1,Poor sound quality and constant audio disturbance,"I finally received the shipment after waiting for 14 days..nevertheless I was glad to finally get it.Immediately I unpacked and connected it to my laptop for my WoW game...I could hear a constant disturbance, very annoying.So I tried with Counter-Strike, still I get the same disturbance..gave me a headache.I'm writing this review just after packaging it back. So please be wary of ""too many"" positive review for a product, so that you don't end up buying from sellers who might not pay you back the shipping money. (a.k.a ripped-off)"
2,Make sure you have the proper inputs before ordering these headphones!,"I'm afraid I cannot judge the 5.1 surround sound capabilities ofthese headphones, as my DVD player does not seem to have the inputsrequired by the product. The package includes a six-plug-to-three-plugconnection cable. The six-plug end is divided into 3 pairs (for front,rear, and center/subwoofer inputs), and the 3-plug end plugs into theamplifier for the headphones.For what it's worth, the phones are very comfortable, and the stereosound is excellent, but I couldn't audit the 5.1 sound. Please makesure you have the right connectors before ordering these."
1,Errr... Bad...,"The quality of the headphones is great, but the preamplifier reacts to cellphones which causes the most disturbing noise I have ever heard in my life, it is bad as that noise pierces through your ears, you realy do NOT want to hear it. The first time I heard it, I was afraid to put the headphones back on. Yes, it was that disturbing. I hate to say it, but you should not buy these."
5,Works great,"This is the best safety lid can opener I have ever used, so I bought my son the same model."
4,good opener,"wanted one exactly like the one I got here (amazon) a while back, apparently not available, this one and another I got both good, just not as good as that one,"
5,Solid & Simple,"Inexpensive, lightweight (yet sturdy feeling), and effective. Not much more to ask for in a can opener. Creates none of the mess (or fear of sharp edge injuries) that traditional openers do. You never have to touch the lid in the entire process. The pinchers used to grab the lid after a complete rotation (and the plastic button that activates them) are a bit on the simple side, but it works.I can't speak to longevity, as I've only had it a few months, but it's a simple enough device. Given my rate of only a few cans a month, I anticipate it lasting quite some time. But really, at under $20, replacing it wouldn't be a major inconvenience either."
3,Could be better,"I like using this type of opener rather than electrics that sometimes drop the lid into the can contents. I've had a Kuhn Rikon previously, but after a while it stopped cutting, so I bought this replacement. It works very well most of the time, but I have encountered a few cans that it just doesn't cut, so I have to revert to the old electric opener. It's better than most others out there, but not perfect."
3,Suffers the same fate as the others,"All the cool design and convenience features don't make up for the one common shortcoming that can openers have. The cutting wheel. We have had Pampered Chef, Zyliss and some others, and they all fail to cut completely through after a couple of years. This opener is super easy to use due to the self clamping mechanism and built in pliers. It was easier to get started than the Zyliss we had, but the cutter on both failed too soon, and we don't open that many cans. Too bad someone can't put the quality where it's most needed."
1,"Looks nice, not durable","Worked great for a short while (a few months), now the internal mechanism is stripped and it doesn't work any more. To the trash it went."
5,Super Easy - Almost too easy...,"This thing is so easy I had to challenge myself on how to use it, looking for the instructions I threw away I went online to figure it out. I actually used it the first time and didn't even know it worked, because it was too easy. I figured out the little grab handles on the right and pulled my lid off. I never read instructions, and in this case you just put the the opener on the can and start turning, duh....I think this is pretty cool and will use it as much as my conventional can opener if not more!"
5,Perfect!,"After finally getting rid of our awful under the cabinet can opener, I took a chance on this item. It is exactly what I wanted. Easy to use, safe for kids, and easy to clean. This is a must for every kitchen."
1,Worst can opener,"When I first used this can opener and found that it crimped the lid but didn't cut the can, I thought it was user error (although I had read the directions several times). So I tried again, and again, and again. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't but in the end, it's not worth keeping a can opener that won't do the job."
1,ugh...,"The model that has the split handle is 100,000 times better. This thing won't release the lid when you open a can. What a pain..."
1,Doesn't really work,We bought this to replace our old pyrex can opener of this type. These kinds of openers have a short lifespan as they slowly lose their cutting edge but this one arrived almost dead. It's also harder than normal to get cans off this thing. It takes maybe 4-5 passes to cut through normal cans and even then you have to pry hard to get the tops off. I've cut myself on a couple occasions doing so. This product doesn't work and I'm not buying this brand again.
1,Extremely poor quality,"I owned a steel Kuhn Rikon ""safety lid lifter"" for approximately five years. I used it daily and it worked perfectly until the gear finally wore out. I bought this new version as a replacement, and it worked beautifully, just like the old one, but only for exactly one week. It then became completely incapable of openning cans. I found it hard to believe that the lid lifter had already failed. I fully expected it to last as long as the first one had. So I was very careful to verify that the mechanim had failed. It had. This lid lifter is garbage and should pulled from Amazon's site."
5,Works as advertised,"I bought this can opener based on a review in Cooks Illustrated magazine and it works great. It opens cans easily. It does not leave any sharp edges. The handle is comfortable to grip. I think the lid removing mechanism (pincher on the side) is a bit strange and awkward, so I don't use it - but I don't have any problem just manually taking the lid off the can."
5,Great can opener.,This is an excellent can opener. I have now purchased three of them. One for me and two for gifts. The cans open easily and lids can be removed safely. The lids are smooth and do not contaminate the food in the cans. The price is good and the quality of this item is much better than the Pampered Chef opener that it replaced.
2,Buy a used Bach,"I don't want to bash this horn too much because it is what it is. It is a cheap Made in China Trumpet that will make notes. But, it is not a quality instrument. It is ""pretty."" Feels nice and sounds ok. But, it is not anything special and if you are seriously looking to buy a Trumpet for yourself to learn (or your child), then buy a used Bach TR300. You can find a used Bach TR300 for $150-200 and it is a Bach! Bach makes quality brass instruments and they're made in USA. I returned this Trumpet and went with a real horn. This Made in China horn had a slow valve and I suspect it would only get worse. It is cheaply made (obviously for the price). Save yourself from problems and don't buy this. The price is too good to be true."
4,The Color was the wrong choice,I love the stethoscope. It works great for what I need and its very handy cause it fits well in my pocket. The only problem I have is the color I chose the Ceil Blue because of how it looks on the web. They did say it looked a little different and that it was darker. In my opinion its lighter it looks almost like its purple. Other then that love it.
3,"So, So",This is a nice product but you pay for the quality you recieve. There is a lot of background noise when using.
3,well.....,"I cant hear lung sounds very well out of it... heart is ok, but to me can be better... I chose it bc it was the cheapest Littman makes... some things u just cant cheap on till u try it..."
5,excellent and lightweight,I love this product! You can hear very well with it and it is extremely light. I took it to work and now two of my co-workers have purchased the same thing.
5,a gift for my brother,My brother is a doctor and he wished to have it so I bought it fir him. he liked it so much and he said it is much much better than any other Littmann products .
5,A gift for my daughter,My daughter is a nurse and she requested this stethoscope for Christmas. Other coworkers in her office have the same one and they really like it. They say it is good quality.
4,Love It!!,It's not as good as my cardiology stethoscope but it's still great for the price. I can hear clear breath sounds.
1,Plastic junk,"I expected so much from a Littmann Stethoscope. I waited weeks for delivery as it was on back order. It arrived today and I am shocked. The tubing is of poor quality, the bell is plastic, and it did not come with extra ear pieces or diaphragm as my previous purchases from Littmann. This stethoscope looks like a plastic throw away isolation stethoscope and will be going back. It's JUNK."
4,Came up a little short for my taste...,"I really like it a lot, I'm an anesthesiologist and for my day to day it's great... It took low marks on the extension, I find the line to be shorter than average, so if you need your stethoscope to reach into hard places, eg. (pts on the OR table) this wouldn't be the best one... Oh high marks on value."
2,Disappointed,"I returned this stethoscope as I did not like the dull finish of the tubing or the metal.Also the hearing quality was less than what I was used to, with Littman's Classic 11.Page"
4,a newer version of the classic,I'd rather get the classic metal one. I find those are better to listen to. These are okay and light.
5,Perfect Stethoscope,"Great color options, but also a great product. Best bell/ diaphragm combo for the price and from a reputable company. Also lightest available for the combo feature. This is my second purchase of this same style steth. My first one broke when falling off a desk 2 years after purchase (out of warranty) and Littman replaced it for free!"
5,great,this littmann stethoscope is a really good one. I would recommend it. It is a simple model but very efficient.
2,It looks old,"Even I ordered a new one, but it came like a used one and very old. I am not going to return it, but I do not want to recommend it to any of my friends."
5,Good Stethoscope,"It's a good product, but the color is somewhat inaccurate. It is sold as Ceil Blue, and it looks like a light blue in the picture, but it's actually closer to amber. It's good for women.Besides that, it's a great product, heart beats are loud enough and clear."
5,great stethoscope,I own 3 Littmann stethoscopes and they are great. I received it within 2 days after ordering. Great purchase!!!!
3,it is ok,great customer service. The product it takes time to get used to it. The more i use it the more i like it. I would recommend this product.
2,not happy,"bought it for my sister as a gift since she just started nursing school but she didnt like it. her class mates have the same one, but hers is different as far as quality. I guess this is a generic sold as the littmann!"
5,reasonably priced and light weight,"I wanted a stethescope that I could hear well through and was light weight enough so I could wear them around my neck comfortably. These fit the bill. Good acoustics and weigh an ounce. I work in anesthesia, not cardiology, so I don't use them to diagnose faint murmers. But for hearing breath sounds and run of the mill heart sounds...they're great."
1,Bad And Cheap,"The $10 scope we bought in PR is 10X better than this crappy unit.Though I tried it on myself and my wife, I couldn't hear any heart sounds whatever.All in all, a piece of crap.INDY"
2,not for me,"I bought this item, tried it out for a few days, and wasn'timpressed with it. I returned it and went up a levelof stethoscope Littmann offered. I recommend spending the extra$ to move up from this level of equipment. You will be glad you did."
1,Very poor quality.,"I am a fan of littmann products. I lost my cardio steth. and I wanted a cheap one to finish a cardiology rotation that I was doing. So I bought this. What a shame. very poor quality, sound insulation and resolution.The only good thing about it is its light wieght. Dont wast your money, OPay a little more and get another one."
1,Not a $169 product,"This is a misleading ad. This basic, albeit quality, stethoscope retails for $50 or under."
3,"Good for the price, but not the best.","I've had my Lightweight for a little over a year. I've found that with this scope, it's harder to hear apical pulses in women or overweight men with a lot of adipose breast tissue. It's good for blood pressure and very basic assessment, but if you're wanting a quality stethoscope, get a Littman Cardiology III. Cardiology III's are quite a bit more expensive, but it's a worthy investment for something you'll use over and over again throughout your nursing career."
4,works well for me,"I purchased this from another site at a comp. price(I think the retail is way over). I use it for my clinicals and labs in my LPN program. It is comfortable and I have been able to hear clearly. I didn't want to spend a lot of $$ on one until I was more compitent with my skills. I really couldn't tell a differnce with quality until I got into the over $150.00 range. After using it for several months I find I like this scope better than the more expensive Littmanns. I would recomend testing several out to find your personal fit though, if you are able."
4,amazingly lightweight,"being a physician and someone who is going into cardiology i would say that this product is great. it is amazingly lightweight (it really feel like a feather around your neck...so much so that sometime i have to make sure it's still there) and this is important because i hadn't realized how much strain my previous stethoscope put on my neck (perhaps i just have a weak neck). however, all this lightweightness doesn't take away from being able to hear murmurs. this stethoscope is perfect for III/VI murmus and above in all four listening areas and nice with carotids as well. i'd say if you are trying to hear those I/VI murmurs...i'd look elsewhere...or get an echo."
5,Great Stethoscope,"I never really thought it mattered what stethoscope you had. If it cost 15 or 60 dollars I didn't think there was much difference. I stand corrected. After listening to lung and heart sounds through this Littmann, I will never again settle for a cheap imitation."
3,Medical Assistant likes Lightweight II,"I just switched to this lighter version of Littmann. It's lightweight feel was nice around my neck. I love the seafoam green color and I was able to hear blood pressures without difficulty. I do have concerns that it may not be as sturdy as my old stethoscope, but we'll just have to wait and see."
5,Mom loves it,"Purchased for my mother, she loves it.. she can hear better and clearer out this one than any she has ever had"
5,Awesome product,Got a cheap stethescope in EMT class and had issues hearing sounds. This came in and 100% difference. Awesome product!
3,Not bad for the price,"I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a stethoscope when I was required to get one for school, so this is the one I chose. It was nice and lightweight, and the ear pieces fit nicely. It didn't have the best quality though, and I wasn't always able to hear things such as low grade heart murmurs. Not bad, would recommend this for a beginner."
4,Littman Stethoscope,It is a good product for a reasonable price. It seemed to have came pretty fast too in the mail.
2,A Doctors Review,"Bought this steth, after using few days found its not of a good quality. Sound is not of good quality. Will Not recomend this to any one. Litman has a excellent name is steth, i am very surprised to see this bad quality from such a good company."
2,3M Littmann Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope,Not so happy with the quality...I guess this is the best you are going get from a baseline Littmann. Will buy a expensive one next time. you can get better quality with a cheaper different company stethoscope. Also asked my nursing instructor to compare and the sound quality was not so great. don't know why this has such a higher ratting.
5,Perfect for EMT class!,"If you don't want to break your budget, but still need to get a quality stethoscope, this one is perfect! I bought this for an EMT class and a future within the medical field, and I am happy to report that it works very well!Bottom line: Definitely worth the $$. Great for EMT/basic medical career.(Even though it's a little more, I got the Carribbean Blue one since it's easier to distinguish from everyone else's dark ones.)"
4,works well for how much I paid,Better than my old one - and how nice that I can fine everything at Amazon instead of having to separately hunt down a medical supplier.
3,"Sound quality is great,","Sound quality is great! I can hear pulses and different lung sounds with ease. All I can say is that the tubing is very short and out of the box the tubing is very shiny, slips from around my neck with ease, and looks cheaply made. Fashion over function right?"
5,Great quality and price,"Littmann is the best, and this stethoscope meets the high quality of the more expensive Littmann's. I definitely recommend it."
5,Excellent,"Very lightweight and very clear. It could be a little longer, however, not worth not liking it. Overall, excellent value."
4,Littmann,Bought this for my brother who is embarking on his journey into nursing school. As a RN myself I have the Cardiology 3 which I love. As my brother is ADHD I wanted a cheaper version but with excellent quality. This has it! I was impressed by how lightweight it was. It has excellent acustics. He told me he is having a blast listening to his standard poodles. Thanks for providing a quality item at an affordable price. Kari RN
3,Stethoscope is nice but...,I rated this 3 stars because the product itself is a good product. The stethoscope is light weight and has GREAT sound. Amazon disappointed me a little with this item though. It was stated as new but when it came it was just the stethoscope thrown in the Littman box on a foam pad (not packaged in foam or anything like it comes in stores). It also did not come with any additional drum heads or ear bud sizes.
5,"Very lightweight, good quality sound","I bought this to have a cheaper, lightweight scope in the car for taking on rounds so I could leave my Littmann Cardiology III at the office. This scope is very light, so it doesn't hang around the neck too well- it tends to flop, but the sound is great. I like it so much that I actually bought a second one for the other car."
5,stethoscope,"It's great, I do EMS I didnt like it in the field but, I know alot of other people that use it and love it that do do EMS."
5,Love It!!,"I love this stethoscope!!! I have used a sprauge style (double tubed) for years but found on the last one I purchased that the sound quality was really awful, but I had just started nursing school and could not afford a Littmann. Well I lost the sprague and was forced to buy a new one. I decided to bite the bullet and buy the good one. I love it! The sound quality is amazing. When listening to the heart, you can actually hear the blood flow through the valves instead of just hearing a beat. This stethoscope is also very light-weight and does not pull at my neck like the others."
5,Nice,I got these just because I wanted some to play with. They are great and light weight. I have to say I don't know what a great one is like but this works well.
3,"OK, but works like my $10 steth","I'm still a student, so I'm sure I'm not very tuned in to the subtle differences in sound between different stethoscopes. But I used an Omron Sprague-Rappaport stethoscope for the past year, and in the few weeks since purchasing this I haven't really noticed a difference in sound quality. The Omron actually is more comfortable for me and the earpieces fit me better than the four different pairs I tried on this new one. As soon as one of the earpieces on the Littman shifts a little, I can't hear anything out of it. So in that sense the Omron is actually better."
4,Buena relación costo - beneficio,"Muy buen producto, buena calidad acústica, excelente precio, no tiene nada que envidiarle a sus contrapartes más costosas, lo recomiendo."
3,"Good Product, Bad Service","The product is great, it's the shipping that took way too long to get here after being sent back to the factory for some reason."
1,to high price as compare to performance,THIS STETHO SCOPE IS VERY EXPENSIVE AS COMPARE TO PERFORMANCE.I WAS GETTING THE SAME PERFORMANCE WITH THE LESS EXPENSIVE ONE.WHY IT IS SO EXPENSIVE I DONT KNOW.BUT I DID NOT FIND ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY LESS EXPENSIVE ONE.MY STETHOSCOPE CAME DEFEECTIVE. ITS TUBE WAS COMPRESSED AND I AM USSING IT.IT IS WORTHLESS FOR THE LOW PERFORMANCE.
2,Not for first year nursing students,I ordered this Littman because the price was great! It is hard to use. I replaced it with a cheap Sprague model from the college bookstore that works great.
3,EVEN THOUGH ITS A LITTMAN ITS....,I GUESS I AM NOW PARTIAL TO THE LITTMAN CARDIOLOGY III. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A LITTMAN IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS AN OK STETH. COMPARED TO THE CARDIOLOGY IT IS SO=SO.
2,Not Littmann's Best,"The lightweight ii is not a bad stethoscope. You'll be able to hear some sounds, albeit faintly. However, after comparing this scope to a couple other littmans, I can say that this one does not offer the quality that you'll find in the Littmann Classic line, and especially not the Cardiology ii that you see all the medical students buy. All the sounds were just far too faint. If you're looking for a scope that will do the bare basics (Littmann recommends this one for BP checks, only), look no further. But if you want to be able to clearly hear murmurs, lung sounds, and other diagnostic sounds, I wouldn't recommend this scope. Move up to a Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope Black Edition or Stethoscope,3M, Littmann,Cardiology, II Burgundy 27 inc.Now I need to sell this scope. Any takers?"
4,good for a paramedic,"This is my second Littmann. I purchased a cardiology II in EMT school and have carried it on over 3000 calls. It was pretty banged up and I decided to treat myself to a new one. The cardiology II is probably the better scope for people in controlled, quiet environments who need to hear subtle heart tones and lung sounds.This Lightweight is magic in a noisy ambulance listening for lung sounds. I don't know if its the anatomy of my old lady ears, but for whatever reason, this scope is the bomb. I can easily discern water from congestion from wheezes and differentiate between good air movement vs quiet spots vs absent sounds, etc. Its made the differential for pre-hospital emergency medicine a cake walk.Love the scope.PS... the lilac color is the bomb."
3,"Excellent Seller, but the item did not correspond to my expectations.","First of all I wanted to say that the seller was fantastic.I did not like the item and she returned my money and accepted the item back without problems.I am a doctor and I thought this would be one of the Littmann high qualities stethoscopes, but unfortunately it does not seam good for a doctor. Nice to measure the blood pressure, but not murmurs."
3,3M Littmann SE II lightweight stethascope,"light weight, pretty good acoustics, comfortable, but not able to hear as well as higher end scopes. overall, a pretty good deal for the money."
5,Littmann stethoscope,"Excellent product, most impressive is the magification of the sounds you hear; did get that quality from the longer littmann stethoscope."
4,Excellent sthethoscope,"I put this on my wish list after an instructor informed me that my double tubed Prestige Sprague stethoscope was inferior. She was right! The old double tubed scope never let me hear very well. Many times heart and lung sounds were muffled.Not so with the fabulous Littman. Everyone in the medical field who doesn't have a cardiology stethoscope has a Littman. Lightweight doesn't begin to describe it: it's like night and day between the Sprague and the Littman. I got Lilac cause I wanted it to stand out. My package came with extra ear buds, just mentioning that because some other reviewer said his didn't.You must not ever take your stethoscope off and set it down in the hospital, because someone will steal your precious Littman, and you will weep. It's awesome. You will not regret this purchase."
2,What?? I Can't Hear!!,"As a nurse with over 30 years experience in the field, I have to say this is NOT Littmann's best. The item is so lightweight, it falls off your neck (if you are one of those folks who slings the stethoscope around your neck). I can't hear squat with the thing. I've used Littmann's Cardiology stethoscopes and I should have stuck with it. Normally I'd recommend an inexpensive stethoscope if you are a healthcare worker who only has to take blood pressures - but I can't even hear that! (And I HAVE had my hearing checked just to be sure it wasn't me - I'm good). Avoid this and spend a few dollars more on a different Littmann if you are a healthcare worker that has to listen to heart and lung sounds. If you are an indivdual who just has to take blood pressures - a cheaper alternative would be better.Can't recommend"
5,The second best Littmann I have had.,"I had my first one in 1974 when I graduated from medical school it is still in my house, it was a lightweigth that on can hold it in the shirt pocket. I have had four more Littmanns and now this wonderful one that you can carry it in your pant pocket. Iam orthopaedical surgeon, but I have check my patients heard since I was a general practicioneer. This is a gift for an old man, as Iam."
2,Inadequate stethoscope,"While I enjoy that the stethescope is lightweight, the sounds are very poor it is difficult to hear lung and heart sounds. I also don't like that the earpiece tubes do not rotate so it doesn't fit in your ears very well. It is true you get what you pay for."
1,Stupid,The guy who sold this item is just idiot because he sold a broken product to me. I purchased and paid for brand new item and he sent something he had already glued before. What a mess.
4,Great DVD!,"This is great live footage of the band. the behind the scenes stuff is a little dull in comparison. overall, well worth it!"
5,"Awesome, like the live show","Very good concert and very well shot DVD. Includes a couple of versions of the promo video clip for ""Revolution Begins"" and one for ""We Will Rise"". Also, a documentary on their Japan experience, which was a bit slow paced but interesting nonetheless. The Japanese are crazy for Arch Enemy. The Japanese have good taste on that regard."
5,"Easy to understand, well written, highly recommended","I highly recommend this book to get a grasp on all the features of the fabulous Ipod. The author obviously has a good grasp in writing technical manuals. Well organized, easy to understand, bits of appropriate humor....this book will leave you with a great understanding of the workings of the Ipod, and well on your way to becoming a power user."
4,pretty good stuff for an IPod beginner,"Easy to follow along with your ipod in hand. Everything that I wanted to know about getting up and running with my iPod, and quite enjoyable too"
2,"Cool idea, but out dated for too much.","This game seems like it would be really cool from the two hours I spent playing it.. it reminded me a lot of my many many hours spent playing Everquest back in the day. Unfortunately, it really does remind me of Everquest from back in the day. Graphics engine has not been updated, and at the same cost as the main competitors, why am I looking further?I'd love to see a game with a great story, or gameplay value, or some other gimmick make it big.. but at least have the current graphics engine, or offer a discount on the monthly rate.The CD1 came unable to read; I have high speed internet, not a big deal.. but hopefully that's not a common occurrence."
4,Mostly good,"This game is a blast, it takes the best parts of EQ and WoW and puts them together in one it seems. The crafting system is the ~best~ I have seen in any game such as this, and everything seems pretty seamless. There are only a few things I have wrong with this game. First, a few relatively simple quest bugs appear to go unfixed, but I didn't find anything that stopped me from playing. The second is the way they do beast races... ugh. They basically just put an animal head on a completely human body, not even a tail! Even if you don't play one of them and don't want to, it completely ruins immersion to see something that looks like a thundercat running around. EQ2 and WoW both do the non-human races much better."
3,Average Game,"Not a ton of fun, but fun. Its very buggy and laggy but this is to be expected for the first few weeks of any MMO. Its a kind of melt of all other Sony MMOs into one game. It has elements from SWG & EQ2 as well as little things from several other Sony MMOs. I was really expecting better, but it is still an ok game. So unless you already have a Station Access Subscription I would suggest you wait until April 24th for The Lord of the Rings Online (Which is a much better and polished game even at this stage of development), and if you have Station Access I would suggest you get the regular edition instead of the limited/collectors edition. So in conclusion:- OK Game- Tons of Lag- Buggy but to be expected early in any MMO- Collectors/Limited edition not worth it unless you are a hardcore gamer witha Station Access Subscription"
4,vangaurd,"even with all the bugs in this game it is still far superior to any mmorpg i have played, including eq1, eq2, wow, daoc, ao, uo, swg"
2,Very Dissapointing,"I am very dissapointed in this seller. The day I recieved this packet it was filled out with the front all sketched, i would have gave it a one star but the seller let me keep it and gave me a refund."
1,Don't be a victim and stop yourself from buying this book!,"I had high hopes for this Book based on the first free pages on ""suprise me"". Surprised I was to see that was the best of it, much like a great movie trailer that leads you to a disappoint movie. It takes more than a few quotes to make a book. This book tells you the author's life story, I read half of it and still didn't see much if any tools on ""how to stop being a victim"". I did sympathize with her struggles but after reading the same story over and over again I was fed up. It is not well written, it doesn't teach much of anything and it is not interesting.I was Hoping for guidance and enlightenment and I found none.Stick with books written by therapists and stay away from this one. I wouldn't read it even if free."
4,Thank You for the courage!,"It really helps sometimes to know that someone has had it as bad as I have (or worst) and has made it through. That empowers me to know that no matter what hand I've been dealt, I can find the tools to get out of it. Bravo Lori, this story inspires us all to be as courageous and giving as you are."
5,Healing Book for Women,"I found so much healing in this book. It is one I have treasured and kept on my shelf. I passed along my old copy to a friend in need who said she has had many people already recommend the book to her. Whether or not you have experienced the kind of trauma Lori Rekowski has, everyone has probably played the victim at some time in one's life. Learn to take a stand and be a victim no more! Thanks Lori!"
5,"Excellent, but not as good as Game Plan","It's terrible when I think a book is great, and it is, but still not as good as Wilson's latest, Game Plan. Funny thing, I basically thought the same thing about Embryo, another of his books, that it was very good, but not quite as good as Donor. Cliche--but he just keeps getting better and better."
3,A Worthwhile Read For The Questions It Raises,"I liked Wilson's Embryo better than this one. I just couldn't connect with the main characters. I don't know why, but the chemistry wasn't there for me. Michael's mother, Marjorie, and his next door neighbor, Howard appealed to me, but their roles were rather small. The pace of the story seemed to lag towards the middle, but then it sped up to a satisfying, action-packed ending. The premise was a good one, and it raises many questions about ethical (and unethical) scientific research. Technically this was a good story, but it wasn't as emotionally involving as Embryo."
3,SWITCHING HEADS,"Charles Wilson's DONOR is another in the prolific volumes of medical thrillers where a billionaire madman has some sordid plans for his future and needs ""donors"" to help him achieve his goal.Wilson's writng is somewhat static and many of his action scenes seemed disjointed and forced. There are some moments of suspense, and even though the plot is somewhat farfetched, in today's medical world it may seem plausible.There's much redundancy in the scenes where our heroine repeats her assertions that her Congressman father was murdered, and it takes a while to get through the labyrinthine plot at times.For its genre, however, fans should be satisfied."
2,"ok: the corral, the earps, and Doc Holliday","Does anything happen in the book besides Holliday's incessant brooding? Pass on this baby. The ""gee, look at me writing"" prose is so twisted that your stomach will soon follow. Two stars for the over-blown attempt."
1,Paul West -- Not OK,"According to the fly-leaf, the Chicago Tribune considers Mr. West ""possibly our finest living stylist in English."" Well, that may be but buddy he was way out of his genre with this book. The only reason I struggled through the entire book is that I finish what I start. Verbose, convuluted, complex and dry are some of the words I can muster up to describe this book. Reading one of the Greek tragedies that West continually refered to would be easier than getting through this horrid work of historical fiction.West is a second-rate Faukner. At least Faukner lived in Mississippi. I got money that says West has never even BEEN to Arizona. I will say that this book had a LOT in common with Doc Holliday. Reading it was about as much fun as going to a dentist -- and did you about as much good as a dentist with a consumptive cough and a shaky hand.Bottom Line: Don't waste your time."
1,Waste of time,Agree with the other reviews. I found this book completely boring. It was my own fault... I bought this book in haste not realising it was fiction (I'm always quick to pounce on a book about the OK Corral). The author has an annoying writing style and presents a far from interesting tale.
2,Doc is no holiday,"Paul West is an accomplished writer whose best work--The Tent of Orange Mist, Ratman of Paris--may, judging by this abortive, muddled misfire of a novel,regrettably be behind him. Aside from any nits re: historical accuracy, ""O.K."" simply fails to cohere as a fully-realized work of mature fiction. Intended to evoke the psychic life of the the tubercular frontier dentist Doc Holliday, ""O.K."" is a badly fumbled, badly jumbled and, for West, disappointingly shallow exercise in logorrhea. Lifeless, pointless, clumsily executed, it is a novel bereft of West's customary grace, wit, insight or energy. The author so clearly failed to connect with or inhabit his subject that ""O.K."" can only be judged his least successful work to date. Too bad. Holliday is an infinitely fascinating figure deserving of better."
4,True to West's Vision,"In response to readers who've bemoaned a lack of historical accuracy-- Paul West, as I perceive him, is an interpreter of culture, an artistic revisionist and a master of mapping out the psyches of some of our most iconic figures in social history. I think he remains true to form with ""O.K,"" and that those readers who are expecting an action-packed, factual treatment of the Old West would be better served by somebody else's novel. If you are interested in careful psychological portraits, however, this is a good read even for those who, like me, haven't the faintest interest in the goings-on of the wild, wild West!"
2,A Hard Read of a Great Weastern Story,"As an avid reader of the Old West and the Earp story in particular, I found this book a major dissapointment. A different type of story to say the least. The central charater is of course John Henry Holliday the ""Fighting"" Dentist. I found the work as presented by Paul West hard to swallow when he has the main charaters talking as if they were dolts and that they treated the towns people as if they were the same. Eg. ""We could be racin dogs,"" Wyatt told him. ""They does that in some countries."" Wyatt Earp never spoke like that. It made the novel that much harder to read. It was a shame that such a great story as the Tombstone Gun fight is ruined by useless verbage as the above. Better luck next time for Mr. West"
5,Kids Love this book!,I read this every night to my son before going to bed. He loved it. He still has the book.
5,A Childhood Memory Forever,"This book has been a family childhood favorite for me and my siblings. We are between the ages of 27 and 34 now and still rave about Socks For Supper. We would talk about how we used to reinact the story while reading the book. If it was the wrong kind of cheese in the fridge, then so be it. It always gave us a feeling of satisfaction, acceptance, and that the characters in the book could be any one of us. It's hard to find books that keep you close at heart, with yourself and with the world. Socks For Supper makes you realize that you need to be grateful for the things you have and the people around you."
5,Excellent for ALL AGES,"I found this book at a Garage Sale when I was doing day care and bought it a long with several others without reading it. When I read it to my children, it brought me to tears because of the sweet message. I have since lost it and am trying to find one. Definitely one of my favorite children's books."
2,Size of Burner,"Thought the burner corner was nice. But, it didn't fit the burners, on my range. Too large."
4,A great old Compilation of Music,"This is the best music compilation ever!! Other versions like Now 39 and Now 40 don't have as much great hits. I have both cd's that I've mentioned, but I would preffer to get the 1998 one. These Cd's are so hard to find in america, and are expensive. I don't give the 5 stars because it's kinda old music, but it can bring great memories. Get this cd!!!"
2,Not CSI,"This book is written from the standpoint of a Philidelpia coroner's office intern, who obviously has never been exposed to cable television. While it was a fast read and interesting, it was very basic in the level of forensics it described. If you have watched any forensic television in the past, this is not the book for you. I hope that in the future, Mr. Temple would go a bit deeper, including not well known forensics to teach the reader a few things. There were interesting side plots about the acting deputy coroners in the office and some of the office politics, but all in all I felt disappointed to spend so much on a very short book that offered no new insights."
2,A Craving for Concinnity,"While Ms. Felman's book is meant as a commeration of the death of her mother, and thus one feels some sympathy, I felt that her book was self-indulgent. Most particularly because of its usage of indecipherable punctuation, (a usage that implies a desrespect for the reader), but also because of the fact that almost every other paragraph seems to be either a request for pity or a request that one concur that the world is a rotten place. In transactional analysis, such cynisism and victimhood is known as ""grievance collecting,"" and one does begin to feel that one is functioning as Ms. Felman's therapist."
3,Only does 3 of the small tubs,"It's not very big and the tubs barely hang on it so it's only for a stable wall in a workshop, not for a moving cart or a door. Otherwise it's cheap and works."
4,Now that's Klezmer,"My first taste of this band was their recent album Metropolis which I've enjoyed a lot. I got this album because I wanted to hear their earlier work because I prefer the less polished old style Klezmer. The playing is great and the musicality is outstanding and for me its icing on the cake that it sounds older and a bit more raw so for my taste, I like this one better."
3,Good for the grieving,"Pepperland was an interesting look into anger, grief and coming ofage. I enjoyed the music references and imagery in this book. I do not think this has a wide appeal, aside from the cover being terrible, the character of Star and the offbeat retro nature of her voice I do not think will captive too many young teens. Also the plotline with Dooley is confusing and will turn off young readers. This book is good for teens tackling issues of grief, especially the loss of a parent."
5,Pepperland is Awesome!,Hello. I would just like to say that I may be a little biased in this review. Mr. Delany happened to be my 9th grade English teacher so I have a bit of insight into the background of this book.Pepperland is wonderful book for anyone who likes a good story based on classic rock. The Beatles and John Lennon are as real characters as Star herself. There is such beautiful insight into the emotions of someone who has lost a loved one and is dealing with grief. One of my favorite books.Props to Mr. Delaney.
4,"Basically, it's Darth Vader's starfighter","This is a mini jedi starfighter in my favorite paint scheme, Darth Vader's green spaceship, and when I first bought it I couldn't really do anything with it. Soon I realized how to get the cockpit open, which is by pulling up on the front. The box didn't say that the wings opened, but they looked like they did so I tried it... And they did! But they go back down very easily, so don't hold it by the wings.Some people say it's paint scheme is not very accurate, I never saw for myself a very good full view of the ship in Ep3, but I like the Titanium mini and I wish the action figure sized version wasn't so rare and expensive."
3,Mediocre at best,"I had purchased Death Machine/Fearless Tiger for one reason:Bolo Yeung. The movie Fearless Tiger featured Bolo and I must say, Bolo Yeung was awesome however he was given maybe 15 minutes of air time if that. Death Machine wasn't much better but for $3, it was worth it."
2,Out of date geology,"I read this book immediately after reading Earth: An Intimate History, which is a current overview of plate tectonics. In several places, Our Restless Earth was directly contradicted by the contemporary research from Earth: An Intimate History. So, unfortunately, Our Restless Earth can't be relied on for correct geological information."
5,Get ready for the shift...Oneness spells it out.,"Oneness by Rasha is amazingly complex and profound. Each word seems carefully selected and every sentence is well crafted. Indeed, line by line, page by page, the book is packed with punch. The truths are clear and simple, however. Oneness is truly a universal guide that describes the unfolding path toward a new world, one that is already emerging in these times."
1,Migranal Rambling,"I have read many spiritual books; some of which require a great amount of concentration (i.e. Conversation with God - by N. D. Walsch)I really tried to like this book based on the previews and my interest in the subject. However, after reading page after page, and encountering the same problem I decided to skip this book (kindle version) entirely. It's the first time I do not finish a book I purchased.The author writes in endless circles in the form of ""...the existencial purpose of your cooperative being on this current dimension from the universal consciousness..."" (I made this sentence up to prove a point). Perhaps she thought the use of too many interesting-sounding words would give more meaning or importance to every sentence; however, for me, it had the opposite effect.This book seemed to lean more toward descriptive rambling than meaningful, constructive thoughts."
5,This is a Must Read...,"If you are reading this review, you have likely embarked on a deep spiritual journey, as I have.Reading Oneness confirmed and explained all the knowing I already possessed.This is my absolute favorite book and truth to date.I also highly recommend visiting Oneness Through Rasha on Facebook for great quotes from the book with beautiful pictures.All the best on your spiritual journey and I wish you love and peace."
5,Oneness for me,"This great book was recommend by a dear friend who is also a transformational teacher and guide. I am not much of a reader. I usually can't sit around long enough to get into a book. Well, I'm on chapter 4 and really captivated. This book, Oneness flows and her writing style is mystic and alluring. I will most likely reread it and definitely recommend this book to all my friends. Thank you Rasha for explaining and sharing Oneness with the world."
5,What a Stunning Book!,"I sat down and read it through completely, and was amazed at the knowledge, and well researched detail that you have presented. Notable, are the medical and technical knowledge together with the care and real concern for Parkinson's sufferers, which is shown by compassionate practitioners in many fields.This has to be the definitive book on this subject, giving hope, support and the tools with which to live as creatively and with as much dignity as possible. I do not just wish you well with it's publication, but am lost in admiration!"""
3,Mainly for Americans,"I have read many of Richard Rohr's books and have found them thought provoking and inspirational. This book was a slight disappointment in that it seemed aimed at the American (U.S.) audience and although the message is universal, it is annoying to have terms like liberal and conservative used without considering that they mean different things in different countries. (that is just one example). However, I will continue to buy Father Rohr's books as his wisdom and insights have been a source of help and consolation on my spiritual path."
5,Works as advertised,"Unlike the others, I actually read the directions and find the product works exactly as advertised. We found it very handy to fasten new heavy black-out liners to our drapes that already had a slightly inadequate built-in liner attached. No, it does not poke through four layers of heavy material when they are held close together but it will go through two layers at a time and the fastener will penetrate all four layers. We have absolutely no complaints about the product and in fact, we even bought a second one to make sure the sewing kit has one dedicated to it."
1,Buttoneer,"I used to have an old one of these that was great but I find this model to be a poor substitute. It is harder to load, would not go through the material of my jeans and plastic fastener did not keep the button on for very long. Mine is just sitting in the package I should just throw it away."
1,Terrible replacement for the original,The original from many years ago was wonderful and WORKED. This one is TERRIBLE and isn't worth the money. I do a lot of sewing and this is one of the worst buys I have made.
1,Piece of junk,Bought this item because we had one about twenty years ago and liked it.Bought this one to replace buttons on a shirt first time I put on the shirt the buttons fell off.plastic fastners didn't hold
4,Contains Good Advice,"Overall, this is a great purchase. However, I believe this is a better buy for the relatively new or young Christian. The text is a simplified KJV which is fine. My only objection is the fact that it does not have a lot of information about important texts in the Bible which may not refer to witnessing and other things present within the WayoftheMaster ministry. It offers a lot of helpful advice and information but such advice is also available at www.evidencebible.comHere's how I would view it: if you are not very familiar with the WayoftheMaster ministry I would recommend this book... however, if you are quite familiar with their ministry, the commentary in this book is basically just a repeat of what they already say and teach. It was a good purchase for me but now I am looking for a little more in depth commentary."
5,Great resource and a lot of interesting reading,"If you get stumped with difficult questions about God, this is an awesome resource to use. It gives a really thorough explanation of several different religions like Buddhism, Mormonism, Jehova's witness, etc. I learned a LOT by reading through those. Plus you'll feel more confident sharing your faith when you have a better idea of who you're talking to, and what exactly they believe. The side notes on a lot of the scriptures are really helpful too. Well worth the money!"
5,Best evangelizing tool,this a great bible easy to read and understand it also has study tools for ministering to people who dont believe in god.This is the best bible i have gotten so far for a low price.
1,I Question This Bible,"I was interested in the Evidence Bible. It seemed to read smoothly. However, a red flag went up for me when I saw a picture of Adolph Hitler in there. What place does Hitler have in God's Holy Word? How could Ray Comfort even contemplate placing one of the most evil men in world history in the Holy Word? It causes me to raise an etebrow about both the book and its author."
5,Very Practical and Helpful!,"What Ray Comfort has compiled in ""The Evidence Bible"" is a MUST for the serious Christian. It has hundreds of great quotes, illustrations and probing answers to hard questions which many people ask. I use this Bible daily and I am so grateful for the practical helps in here. You NEED to get this! :-)"
2,Not Great,"I thought this book was okay. You would like it if you liked learning about Japan during WWII, but I found it badly written. The end is unsatisfactory and the way it was written, even though it was non-fiction was boring to me."
4,"wonderful, but NOT for children!!","If it were a movie, I'd rate it PG-13. I'm sorry to see it in the Children's section at Amazon.I own and LOVE this remarkable, incredible biography of a child's courageous survival under terrible cicumstances (WWII), but it is not for children!!! It begins with some harsh punishment by the author's father, and there are several intimate descriptions of death and dying (including murder-suicides), decomposing corpses, maggot infestation, a near-death chase by a crazed soldier... These are not images for children to dwell on.Thankfully there are a few loving and kind events in this narrative too, but overall a very sad story. Good read on the devastations of war. I truly wish the author well."
4,True story,This book was recommended by the husband of a book group friend. I am glad that Tomiko wrote the story of her experiences on Okinawa in 1945. You wanted to hug and protect this sweet resourceful six year old.
5,A small treasure,"Six-year-old Tomiko is the member of a large, loving family in Okinawa when WWII intensifies. Within months, she is left alone, wandering, trying to survive. It is a riveting--and amazing--piece of history."
4,Finally read autographed copy,"I have a personally autographed copy of this book, that was signed by Burroughs on his kitchen table in Lawrence a couple of years before he died. I've had it on my shelf since that time, and finally got around to reading it last night. Just like his other books, it's a bit hard to understand, and he didn't even write this one. He was quite an interesting man."
5,Excellent overview of the topic,A better overview of sola scriptura would be hard to find. James White does an excellent job explaining why scripture can be trusted and how to handle the frequent objections to its sufficiency and accuracy. An good choice for those looking for a quick read on the topic but deeper than its length would indicate. I find it to be a very useful apologetics tool.
1,Missing an Essential Defense,"One thing that is blantantly missing in this book is a logical defense of its premise. If the Bible is sufficient for all Christian doctrine, then where in the Bible is the canon of Scripture defined, and where in the Bible is Sola Scriture defined. I can't find it in this book. But we do find it in Protestant traditions. While we're at it, I guess the Holy Spirit got it wrong on the Old Testament canon but right on the NT canon? How can that be?"
3,Worth a Catholic's time,"James White is an interesting one. On one hand, his passion and zeal for the gospel and the truth is second to none. On the other hand, he isn't the most charitable, unlike his boy RC Sproul. Certain sections of the book I completely disagreed with and thought his evidence for such reasons were completely flimsy, such as his exegesis of 1 Tim 3:16 to justify sola scriptura. Other sections, such as his analysis of the Chicago Declaration on Biblical Inerrancy and his discussion of the principles of exegesis, were superb and well articulated. I don't think the book gives a satisfying justification of sola scriptura. He spends a lot of time talking about the canon of scripture, but doesn't seem to resolve anything. It still seems true to me that the only reasonable defense of the infallibility of scripture is found in the teaching authority of the Catholic Church."
1,Illogical,"Let's make things right:1. Sola Scriptura [implicitly] says everything we need to know that is necessary for our salvation comes from the Bible alone.2. Knowing what Scriptures are inspired and what Scriptures are not inspired is necessary for our salvation.3. Knowing what Scriptures are inspired and what Scriptures are not inspired cannot be known from the Bible.4. Therefore, Sola Scriptura cannot be true.The foregoing is irrefutable.This is where the book should have begun and ended."
2,Not again...,"They have added MSG (monosodium glutamate) since the last time I bought and used it, so be careful if you are allergic (like me). It's a darn shame that they have to put MSG in everything, and that there is little we can do about it."
4,Happy w/ Choice,"Good product and very solid, especially for the price. Only con (if it is a con) is that it takes some effort to collapse. This however is due to its solid support. Hard to have your cake and eat it too I would suppose."
4,"Werner 222-6 Type II Step Stool, 2-Foot",I like the stool because it is the right height.The only thing about the stool it's hard take apart.
4,Works for me!,"I bought this step ladder because I've developed severe arthritis and I can't hop up on a chair to reach things anymore. The ladder is sturdy, which I was worried about, and is tall enough to allow me to replace light bulbs in my eight foot ceiling. The only shortcoming for me is that the handle on the back is too short for me to hold on to when I am on the next to last step and still reach up for something. I definitely would not go on to the top step."
4,stepping up,This step ladder is well made and fairly light weight. My wife now feels safe when reaching for a dish on the top shelf
4,Consistant,Many a series loses progressive structure and user friendliness after the first book. This series is consistent.
1,Great 10 years ago. Boring today,"Don't buy 10! Try one if you must, but basically this seriesis boring. Its outdated, and therefore should only be had on discount."
1,Dumbed-down math as therapy for the masses,"This book contains some good writing and poor mathematics, quite aside from one's political point of view. The critical reviewers of the book are substantively correct. In terms of Ms. Cole's purpose and intended audience, well, what sort of ""success"" is dumbed-down math as therapy for the masses?"
2,Don't we deserve more?,"I am thoroughly tired of well written, simplistic math books. Dime a dozen. Yes, she is a good writer. Why can't the readers be expected to actually learn real math? Are we considered too incapable. Yes, I would expect the author to have a fundamental (at least) understanding of partial differential equations - and the readers as well."
1,Not one tree should have had to pay the ultimate price.,"I strongly advise reading these two earlier reviews submitted to Amazon. These two folks have it right:[1] A Reader from Virginia , 03/16/98, rating=1:Hoagwash in the name of mathematics.[2] [netid] from West Virginia , 03/08/98, rating=3:This book is vague and full of political polemics.The boilerplate from the professional [sic] reviewers is, by and large, pure fiction. This is the first really, really bad book I've selected sight unseen from Amazon. I'd suggest no one else need make the same mistake."
1,Neither Math Nor Physics,"It is tough even for the most learned to become proficient in both mathematics and physics. Adding the ability to organize thoughts well, and illustrate them clearly by example is a talent reserved for a very few....Unfortunately, K.C. Cole is not that person. Her book is a random walk through the mysteries of both technologies, much too often poorly stated, if not entirely wrong. From the first page to the last, she seems to be as befudled as the layperson. Richard Feynman in his later years took issue with the misconceptions that are being put into the textbooks for school children. Too bad that this award winning book is no better at getting the facts straight."
2,A note to the author,"If you find yourself writing footnotes that say ""*See chapter X"" at the bottom of almost every page, it means that your book is repetitious.This book has a few neat little anecdotes about mathematics and science, but the rest of it is just airy-fairy handwaving about how complicated the universe is. That's great, and definitely true, but the lack of detail and depth make each chapter read like the introduction to a much better chapter in a much better book."
2,Disappointing; other books are better,"I expected more from K.C. Cole; she's an excellent general science writer for the L.A. Times, but she comes up short in this book. This book is clearly trying to bring an appreciation of math to general readers, but she does no better than to say ""Look at that over there; if you understand it, it's really neat"" -- but without trying to give you any sense of what's neat.By contrast, I highly recommend ""The Language of Mathematics : Making the Invisible Visible"" by Keith J. Devlin. Devlin not only points out what is interesting, but provides enough depth to give you a fleeting glimpse of the way mathematicians see math."
1,how to write a book in five minutes,"Should it be that easy to write a book? Collect all the bits and pieces from newspapers' weekend-supplements and almost scientific coffeetable-talk and toss in some currently fashionable phrases concerning physics and mathematics, stir until the lumps have disappeared and do not bother with the spices of explanation and insight. If you love math and physics, stay off !"
4,"Real, intelligible mathematics for non-mathematicians","If you liked math in school but were so bored by the time you slogged through high school geometry you gave up on the whole thing, this book is a refreshing look at what mathematics REALLY is -- a way of looking at the world, not worksheets full of equations. You can argue about some of the conclusions, but Ms. Cole nicely hands you the tools to do just that."
3,Not His Worst Book,"Did I enjoy Punk Land? Yes, sort of. Did I have to force myself to finish it? Unfortunately, also yes -- and a more definitive yes at that. Unlike the narrative movement in many of Mellick's other works, Punk Land's details didn't connect well enough to propel me through the story. Mellick brought back three characters (don't forget Breakfast) from a previous work and did nothing with them, as if he wrote them into the story in name only. For most of the novel, the narrator seemed more of a whiny observer than an integral part of the story. His love interests were unclearly divided and never adequately resolved. If not for Shark Girl's awesomeness, I doubt I would have finished this book. In other words, Shark Girl = Punk!"
5,"If you don't know where to start, get this book","The book will not only demystify the whole process for you, it will also give you great information on prepping for your interviews and essays. Although a lot of the book is devoted to only ten schools, the advice applies to anyone applying to a top tier b-school. If you do the suggested exercises, you'll see a list of jobs and activities mold themselves into a self-marketing campaign."
3,Not the best book out there...,"I thought Montauk's book was a much better take...How to Get Into the Top MBA Programsby J.D., Richard Montauk"
1,"Poor research, poor edits, and not insightful","Beware of this book -- it lays out specious arguments about getting into b-school which are likely to get you FLAGGED by admissions offices! The book is sloppy, poorly researched, and much of the material has been pulled from Business Week articles. Don't bother -- I did and it was a BIG waste of $ and time - both of which are precious when apply to b-school.Good luck!"
1,Way overhyped and far too expensive,This book doesn't give any particulars about essays or the information on the schools. It states a bunch of fairly obvious things and gives a bunch of example essays. (I thought your essays were supposed to be different and unique.) There are far many more books that are a lot less expensive. (Perhaps the cost of being officially supported is in the price?)I got far more out of the Business Week book.
3,Definitely focused on these specific 10 colleges...,"A thorough digest, if the schools targeted in your applications are among the schools focused in the appendices and are ranked in the top ten.Focused on full time MBA programs, for someone seeking schools offering part time MBA programs and in the immediate vicinity for convenience's sake, this book did not fit my bill. The ""Ranking by Location"" chapter does not possess the same degree of attention as the ""Ranking by Salary"" chapter. Multiple spelling and grammatical errors were found. However, this publication must be lauded for its concise format...for someone with limited time, the gist was easily communicated.Definitely useful in material to get you into the business school of your choice, but the b-school of your choice is not necessarily everyone else's top b-school. I must admit that I was disappointed by the lack of other relevant information in regards to application strategy...there can definitely be an abridged version of this book."
3,Don't rely on this onboard a ship.,"When I took a cruise with the family, I thought I might need a way to communicate with my husband both on the ship and on land. We bought these and tested them out. They do work. Our problem was on the ship, everyone had the same idea and we were hearing everyone else's conversations. Switching channels did not help. They also tend to have a lot of static, though I'm not sure what model does not have that problem. It was too difficult to hear each other over the noise, so we didn't really use it at all.My son plays with his friend with these. His friend lives three doors down and they can hear each other at least that far away. So, it works and is probably best used as a higher quality children's toy.At least as a mode of communication on a ship, I wouldn't use these. On land, I think it's better, but I prefer cell phone access when I can get it."
2,cheap cheap cheap,"This costume is even flimsier than most of these dress up dresses. It didn't even make it through three wears, which is all I wanted from it. It's cute, but my daughter complained that it was itchy and then it ripped down the side the first time she wore it. I tried to repair it as best i could, but the whole thing was very annoying."
5,mike in montana,"This kit comes with so many extra parts, its a bit ominous at first. Once you narrow down the parts to your specific applications it's a very smooth install. The finished product has a factory look and I would highly recomend this product. I read a couple of reviews that complained about having to remove a couple of mounting tabs, but I just used wire cutters and trimmed with a razor knife for a smooth fit."
3,I expected some thing else.,"I had multiple issues with it. Like other people complained, I disliked that I had to cut stuff to fit. I would recommend purchasing a item that is specifically for your car. I had to use oem parts and metra parts so it would fit properly. Ones fitted it looked clean. In a difficulty range I would say Moderate."
4,Good fit for 96 Maxima.,"The Dashkit did what it was supposed to.Engineering one molded part to fit multiple vehicles is a marvel.Unfortunately you only use the main piece; all the other extra parts are for other vehicles.The Maxima factory bracket, on the other hand, was a major pain.The holes didn't line up with the new Sony Xplod head, and the Sony mounting sleeve (where youhave to bend the little triangles up to secure the sleeve in the dashkit)interfered with the metal bracket. A bit of jerry rigging got it together (drilled holes to accomodatethe bent metal tabs).The PAC ROEMNIS2 for the harness adapter worked very well with the install."
4,Install Kit for '98 Nissan,"Used this kit on a '98 Maxima, replacing OEM non-Bose radio. Kit required some modifications, but step by step directions were included and were complete"
4,Did the Job,"As is noted, it's a one-size-fits-all mount kit. That means you'll feel guilty about throwing away more plastic as you keep. But the directions were surprisingly accurate, and this was the only one available for the year-model.The bezel doesn't fit on my 97 Mercury Villager (same as 97 Nissan Quest). I put the Clarion unit's plate over it, but just barely. To resolve a bit of the metal box showing, I put electrical tape over that edge and then put the plastic plate back on. Considering how difficult it would be to retro something to fit my vehicle, they did a good job. In this year-model, the plastic kit entirely replaces the metal radio box that is in the dash from factory.Not great, but functional. No real complaints on functionality."
5,Worked perfectly,Made the installation of a Pioneer unit into a 2004 Nissan XTerra work perfectly. The factory unit was twice as tall as the Pioneer unit. This multi-kit allowed the smaller unit to fill the opening and provided an opening under the radio as a place to put an Ipod or a cell phone.
3,"Looks good, but not of good quality","Let me preface this by saying now that it's installed in the 1999 Nissan Altima, it does actually look really good with the Kenwood unit I just installed. However, I spent plenty of time with a Dremel cutting 95% of the tabs off, which certainly didn't look pretty, but they aren't visible once installed. There's no way you could break them off without a cutting cool, and definitely not a knife. Additionally, I was an idiot in a rush and cut one of the wrong tabs off so it's mounted with only 3, so be careful. However, it feels fairly secure. The factory screw heads were a little small for the slots on this dash kit so it might not be a bad idea to use some washers for a more secure mount. Would I buy it again? Maybe, but I'm sure there are much better products out there. In the end I am satisfied with the install, but took a little too much work to prepare it."
1,Missing Items/Parts and saying they are not responsible,"I ordered the Metra Dash Kit and received it with missing parts. Acting in good faith, I emailed them and they responded to give them a call, So i did. When I was on the phone with them, they said they are not responsible and I have to contact the manufacturer and it's my problem. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE BEWARE."
2,Buyer Beware,"This kit works but is almost impossible to get together. Everyone else is correct they give you 3 times the amount of pieces you actually use. Then you need to CUT the ""tabs"" off the plastic to make it fit for your vehicle. THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS THE PLASTIC IS SO STURDY THAT YOU NEED TO USE A HANDSAW TO DO IT. The packaging shows a utility knife doing the job but you'll be there all day. This is ridiculous. Once the kit was in we realized that because the 99 Altima has a trim piece that the faceplate would not fit. It does hold the radio but I'd have to say there must be a better kit out there."
4,Very useful piece of kit,Very useful kit to install your new receiver to your old car. The instruction was very simple but missing few steps for certain (at least for the make and model of my car) models. But easy to figure it out! Good stuff
5,Beautiful.,"A European style art movie, with the slow pace and deep emotional exploration that this entails, but with the extraordinary natural beauty of a California coastline location, and the highest of Hollywood production values.A very beautiful film. Intimate, for sure not a happy movie, but with tender moments of natural lightness, and lashings of reflections and insights into the human condition.Oh, and I did compose the soundtrack, by the way, so this will of course make some of you think I'm biased for Team To Be Friends... but actually, I wouldn't have written a review at all if I didn't mean this.So proud of this little film, and also, the wonderful performances of Joelle Carter and Todd Stashwick under Jim Eckhart's skilled direction."
4,Supervising Volunteers,"I have been a volunteer for years and have several years experincing supervising volunteers. For anyone who is responsible for recruiting and supervising volunteers, this book is a must! My current job invloves part-year volunteers and it means a lot to do everything practical to help make this years experience for them rewarding so they will sign up with me again next year."
5,great,Easy friendly to user only flaw it's made only 30 min long other than that is great. would recommended to other to buy
4,"Text Book Review - Structural Analysis (6th Edition), by Russell C. Hibbeler","This text book is great for describing both the introductory and advanced methods of structural analysis, i.e. statically determinate/indeterminate structures and matrix methods. ASCE-7 is referenced quite frequently in the beginning chapters of the text. Colorful diagrams are present throughout the text to give the reader a better understanding of the material. The only negative aspect of this text book is that it does not describe two-way floor loading very well. Recommendations: anyone who has an interest in structural engineering should buy this book."
3,Not like new,"The book is not as what it was described. The seller wrote that it is like new, but it has an amount of highlighting and writing in it."
2,"Nice try, but full of errors","This book could be a great book for the unergrad intro to structures course. It has a nice writing style, it is easy to understand, and has plenty of example problems. However, it is FULL of errors. It think someone in my class would find a new error at least once a week."
1,terrible text for undergrads,"I am a civil engineering student and this was the text for my structural mechanics course, and I hated it. There were no exaamples, those contained within skipped half of the steps, and there were numerous errors throughout the text. I do not reccommend this text to other students."
2,Expected more than we got...,"Had high expectations of this dictionary based on the single review then posted, but we find it's seldom of much use when doing the daily puzzle in our paper. It's laid out quite nicely, but missing tons of things. We now use it only as a backup when other dictionaries fail. Disappointing overall."
4,Nice Commentary,"Read through this for a Masters level course on Romans.It is well written, well documented and quite helpful in many areas.I really liked the exposition of Romans 9-11. Great work and it helped me fill in several gaps in my understanding.The book is worth it just for those chapters."
5,Living History,Robert Payne has brought the crusades alive in my mind. His vocabulary was exquisite. His understanding of the people and things he writes about is excellent.
1,defective book.,"book fell apart , duplicate pages, unreadable in some places, no cover, binding in disarray.i ended up using it to start a fire, cr."
2,Not exactly a well-edited page turner,"While this book will deliver a comprehensive history of the various Crusades to the reader, the editors must have been second year English students. One of the most obvious examples is where, within eleven lines, the exact same wording describing a particular castle is used. Great for Alzheimer patients, but otherwise unnecessary. On the other hand, archaic terms go unexplained as if we're supposed to be conversant with every aspect of Christian practice in the first milliennum. Word choice is sometimes overly academic, so keep your hardcover dictionary nearby. That said, I learned quite a bit about the Crusades from the book, but it probably could have been written in a much more erudite fashion."
4,Funky Shui Delight!,"This is a fabulous book! I enjoyed the light hearted approach and prefer Funky Shui to the sometimes ""taken too seriously"" Fung Shui. The pictures are terrific - great collections are showcased in a way that inspires me to bring out some of my collectibles and add more of my personality to my home. Let's see something else from the sisters, and...as I have three sisters of my own, I am getting copies for each of them - too much fun to pass up!"
5,Something new and unique for your CD collection,"Heard album for the first time today and immediately logged on to Amazon.com to buy it. What a unique sound! I found the music to be very modern while at the same time smooth and easy to listen to. The type of music you like the first time you hear it and want to listen to again and again. Buy it and be the first to introduce it to your friends, you won't be sorry!"
4,Visual Fitness : 7 Minutes to Better Eyesight and Beyond,"So far so good.Am only on the sixth chapter now, and the book promises no quick fixes.If I keep up the decipline, I will be able to tell you how I feel in a few months time."
5,LOVE EM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I GIVE THIS TAPE A TEN, IT DESIRVES IT FOR THE FIRST EPISODE, AND ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE, ABOUT AN ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT DRESSED AS SANTA CLAUSE ON NEW YEARS EVE. THE SECOND STORY, YELLOW, IS GOOD DUE TO A GREAT CAST, AND AN UNEXPECTED ENDING. THE THIRD STORIE'S PLOT, AND SCRIPT AERNT THAT GREAT, BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS USED IN FOREST GUMP, BY THE AWARD WINNING DIRECTOR, ROBERT ZEMECKIS (WHO ALSO DIRECTED ALL THREE EPISODES ON THIS TAPE) IS PHENOMENAL. YOU MUST SEE THIS TAPE! END"
1,Arts and Crafts (Architecture and Design Library),"I returned it. Not what I expected....pictures are not relevant to the Arts and Craft movement. Too many new designs in newer homes. If you want to get a good book go with The Bungalow, Americas Arts and Craft Home. This book has more to offer and better photos,inside and outside of the Bungalow."
5,"Great Reference Book, Great Service","I am extremely happy with both the book and the book seller. This completes my Architecture & Design Library which I use and reread continually. As I am very familiar with many of the photos in this particular book and the Arts & Crafts movement is my favorite design era,I am happy that I've saved the best for last. The book came in record time and was in nearly pristine condition. I will certainly buy from this supplier again."
5,GUI Design for Test and Measurement,"As a long-time LabVIEW programmer, I know how easy it is to create rich, graphical user interfaces with LabVIEW. I also know how frustrating it is to have an end user sit down in front of my LabVIEW masterpiece and not have a clue of what to do. In his easy to read style, Dave explains effective user interface design and how to apply it to test and measurement.I especially appreciated Ch. 6 ""Graphic Design for Engineers 101 - A Crash Course in Layout and Design."" The discussion on designing an effective layout and the provided templates are excellent."
5,A Little Treasure,"To Be Someone rates as one of my favourite reads of last year. It is in turn both funny and moving. Told in flashbacks accompanied by significant songs, it was a real nostalgia trip for me that brought back so many memories. Louise seems to have an almost effortless ability to write damn good stories! It would be unwise to miss this little treasure."
2,Not very good,"I thought this book was long, boring, dull and could not get through it fast enough. I did think of not finishing the book, but I finished. I would not recommend to anyone. If I had to do over again I would not have read this book. (FYI - It is written in what I call British English. The story is about an English girl.)"
2,I was disappointed,I was expecting colored pictures to help me identify my linens. Some of black and white pictures were so dark you could hardly see the design. However the research on the linens was excelent
3,Hit and miss,"This book is strickly bathroom reading, and I only found one or two call transcripts to be genuinely funny. A few more gave cause to grin. Some were simply cruel for no good reason. Fine for three minutes at a stretch, but this does not compare in quantity or quality to any of the Onion volumes. Should you buy? That's a tough call..."
1,Is the book itself a joke?,"So, it's transcriptions of prank calls? What about actually just putting it on a CD? Now that's an idea! Seriously? Who allowed a book of prank phone calls to be published in an era of downloadable soundfiles? A ludite?"
4,I Can't Believe He Did This!,"A Highly inapproapriate, moderately embarassing, painful to read book that is REALLY FUNNY."
4,Olive Drab Vintage Star Bag,"Good durable product, but pockets do not fasten securely (if at all). Not recommended for carrying any small items in as they will surely fall out."
5,MOST UNDERATED LP OF THE YEAR,"Remember 1990-1994, it was refreshing every artist had there own style lyrically and sound... THEN BLING BLING happend and creativaty to a back seat and went underground. If you enjoy artist such as COMMON, TSLIB KWELI, MOS DEF, JEAN GRAE, BUSTA RHYMES , THE ROOTS, If you enjoyed that 90's sound or feel of music from artist like tRIBE CALLED QUEST , KRS ONE, this lp has lyrical creativaty with use of metaphores as well as excellent story telling techniques. language is not vulgar mostly kept to min or non exsistant 9 can definitely play around kids.. PERFECT just not marketed or getting air play... also check out ( EMC-THE SHOW/ MASTA ACE- DISPOSABLE ARTS & A LONG HOT SUMMER/ ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT - MASTA ACE & EDO G / D.I.T.C. - WORLDWIDE / PETE ROCK - HIP HOP UNDERGROUND SOUL CLASSICS / MY OWN WORST ENEMY- EDO G & PETE ROCK) HIP HOP ISN'T DEAD IT'S UNDERGROUND"
4,Dr John delivers.,"This one I held off on buying, but, finally gave in and bought it.Old music was never really my thing to listen to, but, Dr Johns style of delivering the old sounds, now has me hooked."
5,Fantastic,This is the best CD I have heard in years. Absolutely wonderful musicians and arrangements.
2,Neither Duke nor Doctor,"Ellington purists may be put off by the lack of depth and nuance in these interpretations. Fans of New Orleans funk and of Dr. John himself, may miss the lack of rolling, sexy grooves that one looks for in that type of music at its best. No one gets lost in the groove and nothing takes off. This is a case where the things essential to either jazz or New Orleans funk have been lost and what is left is neither here nor there - a pale imitation of either. I will play it but I would never say to a friend, ""You have to hear this."""
2,Where's the fonk?,"I hate to be the lone voice in the wilderness, but I found this album terribly disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I like Dr. John and I like Duke Ellington, but the styles just aren't compatible (I mean, I also like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Count Basie, but I wouldn't want to HEAR ""The Chilli Peppers Play Basie"", ya know?).I bought this album withhout hearing it based on a stellar review in the Baltimore Sun; the reviwer also remarked on how ""fonky"" it sounded. Sorry... I just don't hear it (and, like the Supreme Court, while I can't define funk, I know it when I hear it).Any listeners looking for GREAT contemporary interpretations of classic big band-era songs should RUN, not walk, to the nearest store and pick up the ""Night and Day"" album by Chicago."
1,Too Much and Not Enough,"The first Dr. John recording I heard was Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack. I thought it was breathtaking. It was a total surprise to me that anyone today was still writing and playing Boogie Woogie (or New Orleans Piano). His technique was powerful and flawless.After awhile Dr. John started to sing on his recordings. First it was just for fun, easy enough to take.But that's changed now. So, a contrarian rating: much too much singing (if that's what it still is at this point), not enough piano. Like Harry Connick, Jr., Dr. John has decided to sacrifice the thing he is really a star at for something else -- but Harry Connick can sing pretty well, whereas Mac Rebennack has turned himself into a curiosity."
3,where's the Duke?,"The first two tracks have nothing of Ellington left in them: ""Wrong Side"" sounds suspiciously like ""Life ain't nothing but a party"" which Rebennack and Doc Pomus crafted for B.B. King twenty years ago. ""Fishin"" has a clever Peggy Lee lyric but the 70's funk approach loses Ellington's rhythmic excitement. Both tracks work well as Dr. John tracks. The real charmers on this record are ""Satin Doll/Mood Indigo/Do Nothing"", songs from three different Ellington decades, all served up with evocative Dr. John vocals. Bobby Broom's guitar work shines on ""Fishin'"" and ""Satin Doll"". Most of the instrumentals are dull compared with Ellington arrangements, but ""Flaming Sword"" is superb, all New Orleans funk with graceful piano work."
5,"Wonderful,,,,,,Unique, a new formant for the Dr.","I am a sold out for DR John, being a former French Quarter resident I go so spolied hearing his great writing and performances...I think this must have just beena release but didn't have it in my collection , the price was write and so was my mood.What da hell , I know there was No Way Dr, John was going to screwup do the Duke's work.....Wow!! I was sure right, This is kick ass unusual Dr John music, what a fantasic set of tunes he places and his instrumentals are super off the end of the format of what the good Dr, usually plays,,,,,He is honestly Elegent just as the cover says.Thanks all of the way from Mich Dr..........."
4,Can you hear him pumping on your stereo?,"The Doctor comes through with an astonishingly original and delectably funkalicious tribute to one of the greatest black artists of all time. After his disappointing ANUTHA ZONE album (title track and 'Sweet Home N'Orlins' excluded) the doctor returns to his dirtiest and grooviest on an album that restores my faith in the man's legendary status. The standout tracks, in my humble O, are the opening track - one of the best songs i have ever heard -, Perdido, Solitude, and the awesomely sexy Flaming Sword, which is the closest thing I have heard to the great 'Fess since he shuffled off the mortal coil. if you don't buy this album, you will regret it. It's as simple as that."
4,Duke Elegant,"If you want an album of old standards sung sweetly then this is not for you. This disc ""funkified"" the the keyboard sounds of the ""Duke"" as only the ""Doctor"" can do it ! The group really hits the groove on ""Caravan"" and ""Flaming Sword"". I think the ""Duke"" would have really dug what da ""Doctor""has given us."
4,Good intro to sitar,"Having bought a sitar, which came with a not-too-helpful manual, I bought a book (""Learn to Play on Sitar"", also from Amazon), but I still had a lot of questions. There are some things that just make more sense when you see them. He does a good job of explaining tuning (the top strings, not the sympathetic strings), and the sitting position. He got me to the point where I had my sitar in tune (ignoring the sympathetic strings), sitting correctly, and making some noises that weren't terrible.Of course I still had questions - but this is only the first video in a series. Playing the sitar is just not something you are going to pick up in five minutes."
1,Is there a zero star option?,"I am amazed this book was published! It is very poorly written and has many distracting grammer errors. The author appears to believe she is an expert on US and Indian lifestyles. If her comments about India are as inaccurate as those about the US, any reader will be wildly misled. I struggled to finish reading this because I had carried it from Chicago to Delhi, but abandoned it in an airport waiting room immediatly after turning the final page. Fellow travelers will understand why I did not toss it aside sooner, but perhaps nothing to read would have been better than this. With many great books about India available, stay away from this one."
5,Durable Mats,We are very happy with these mats. Have been using them for several months now. Perfect fit for our car. Would buy this item again.
2,Not worth it.,"The material and design is great for the purpose, but it didn't fit properly in a 2003 Impala. The top left side overlaps a piece of the flooring. This was a present, so I can't give any details other than what I know. Too bad the dealership no longer sells old car mats, I would have bought that instead of this."
1,Husy floor mats,Floor mats are not wide enough. They left an exposed area 3 to 4 inch area between door sill and carpet. This means when I get into my van I will probably step on the exposed carpet and not floor mat. I spent a lot of money for a product which will not fully protect my carpeting in my van. The pic you posted even shows the exposed area I am refering to. Floor mats are being returned. I will shop around locally for mats the fit. I can also purchase cheaper mats which will do as good to protect my carpet as the Husy brand does.
1,WARNING - These are NOT custom fit floor mats.,"Don't be fooled by the misleading description of ""Custom Fit"". These are generic designed rubber floor mats period. Rubber seems to be of high quality but fit is not good in my 2008 Impala and not worth paying the extra $."
2,The least interesting Batman story I have ever read,"I found this at a used book store for $5.00, which in my opinion is overpriced. This story is very dull, sloppily paced, and utterly pointless. I'm not sure what the motivation behind this story is because there is so little substance to it. It's the worst Batman graphic novel that I own."
5,my new must have baby item,"This is absolutely one of my new favorite baby products! It's stack-able shape is a perfect fit for any diaper bag or purse, and makes it easy to find. You can stack one or two for short trips. It's easy to take apart for cleaning. It's 'funnel' attachment was great for pouring powder formula into bottles. As kids got older it was also great for small snacks."
3,Excellent design - okay quality,"I bought this before my son was born and it made it extremely nice for middle of the night feedings when you're totally exhausted and would find it difficult to measure formula. Good design in that the openings fit perfectly in the top of a bottle...no spills. However, the tabs that link each piece together get weak and break very easily. My son is 7 months now and only one of the compartments can still be used."
5,Best Ever,"Love the shape, size, capasity, and look. It is far supior to any other formula divider I have seen in the stores."
5,I found some great new restaurants!,I have been a vegetarian living in Seattle since 1991; this book revealed some great new vegetarian places I had somehow missed! I gave it to a visiting friend. Great book for a person visiting town; fits right in your pocket.
1,What Happened?,"Looper (Stuart David formerly of Belle & Sebastian) started out with a bang. The debut album was a great mix of spoken word pieces and and very good, well crafted pop songs that formed a wonderful, unified whole. Anyone who has seen Looper perform live can apreciate how good and talented they truly are... which is why this new album is such a let down.I am a big fan of Stuart David's work both with Looper and while in Belle & Sebastian, however ""The Snare"" is just completely uninteresting, uninspired and droning."
1,Miserable,Remember the lush and loopy Scottish-folkies-meet-mixing-board electronica/pop sound of the Looper you had come to know and love? That's all been abandoned. Here we have a series of relatively conventional songs with Stuart David's uninspired vocals in the foreground. A regrettable change of course.
2,A Different Path,"Gone are the cute keyboards and purposeful tape hiss of the previous two albums and the MP3 EPs. Instead, we get drum sequences and echoey, bell tone synthesizers. The closest thing in any of their previous albums to the content of The Snare would probably be ""Pale Blue E-Type"" from The Geometrid though even this song doesn't betray the lounge feeling of this newer record. In fact, without the whispered vocals and electronic blips of previous, they don't sound much like the older Looper at all. Instead, they sound like Olive, Mono, Dreadzone, or Hooverphonic. For my money, the aforementioned bands all do a more capable job with this sound.The focus in song writing is atmosphere, groove, and hummable hooks. I don't find the hooks as hummable as in previous installments but, then again, I didn't get into either the atmosphere nor groove. There are people out there who will like this sound but it's not what I was expecting. Look for my copy in the used section."
2,F'ing around,"Not a logical extension of 2000's The Geometrid. This is very, very mellow. I was ensared by the earlier Looper sound, as it was almost danceable, but here there is no dance-floor material. Some of the horns remind me of Belle and Sebastian. It's a sit-back and vegetate disc."
5,One of the most enjoyable children's books for all ages.,"Our whole family enjoyed this book. The poems are silly, the illustrations are fun, and we always seemed to laugh a lot. I wouldn't trade those evenings reading with the boys for anything! We bought our local bookstore out and have given them away to friends. We are down to our own copy and need more for our sons homes."
5,Creme de la Creme,"There is no way for me to convey the top notch quality of Mr. Tripp's humor and art work in the sketched scenes that decorate both front and back covers and also accompany each verse in this volume. While each of the nonsense verses are wonderful in their own right, the accompanying drawings (with the comments created by Mr. Tripp for the little animal characters he has sketched for each scene) are absolutely delightful!I received this book as a gift from my husband many years ago and I have worn it to a frazzle enjoying it over and over; it is my healthy tension-reducer and stress manager. Although it is presented as a child's book, I am convinced it was sketched for grownups. I am at a loss for words to tell what an indescribably delicious treat you will find in this book no matter what your age!"
1,Thank God she isn't singing...,"There's a lot of good Xmas music on this disc, and THANK GOD rachel ray isn't singing one of them. The only chef I want to hear sing is The Chef from The Muppets. Could Rachel Ray be anymore UNCOOL?! I didn't think so until I saw this. What a lame-o!"
4,A superb guitar player shows-off his stuff,"Earl Hooker's great guitar playing shines through on this recording. The ""Bug"" is Earl's reference to his bout with TB, which almost killed him.Earl's an incredibly versatile player and this recording highlights the spectrum of his playing. In a 1970's interview, BB King listed Earl Hooker as one his favorite players, and offered the following analogy - ""If Earl Hooker was a truck driver, he'd be able to back his rig into any space, no matter how tight...""By the way... when Jimi Hendrix went to Chicago early in his career he played back-up for Earl & learned alot about how to use a wah-wah.... Listen closely and you'll hear Earl tearing off several riffs that later became parts of Jimi's sound."
5,hidden legend waiting to be discovered,Earl Hooker is a master of the wah pedal and slide. Noone has found a way to get a sound like his in all the years I've been listening to the blues. This album is a must have for any blues collector.
5,King of the Wah pedal,"This recording is a classic for all blues fans and guitarists alike. Earl plays slide guitar with a wah pedal to give his music a unique sound that NOBODY has duplicated. If you had to choose from the ten best blues albums, this one should definately be on that list."
1,Wasted My Money,"Calling this a ""massage"" mat is a joke! It is more of a low grade vibration mat. The heat is next to nonexistant...I really wasted my money on this one!"
5,Great Aussie tale!!,"Twelve year old Bill Pascoe lives in the South Australian harbour town of Port Lincoln. Treated like a loser by nearly everyone and given the nickname 'Snook' because of his gangly features, he is friends with three other boys who are also considered ""down and out"". One of them dies in a fishing tragedy at sea and the future looks bleak for the rest of them. When a waterspout nearly destroys his father's fishing boat, Snook must get both he and his father back to port. Three crewmen are lost in the tragedy. Snook 'becomes a man' in the eyes of family and at the conclusion one can tell he is really going to get somewhere in life. Hopefully his two mates will follow suit... The film from this book was released in the late 1970's, with a slightly different ending."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. It wasn't like the others in the series I read. It hardly had any of the main Outlanders characters in it and I didn't like Team Phoneix at all.Some people may like this book because of all the violence but that's about all it had.
4,You can always get what you want,"I have found this book to be motivational, inspiring, and very practical.Aftert practicing some of the ideas, I have achieved success at work, in my social life as well as personal relationships.Now I have a better spirital understanding which allows me to relax and remain calm under stressful situations.Thank you Phil."
3,A SOUNDTRACK THAT WILL MAKE YOU SMILE...,"Though ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" is a modern day musical soundtrack, the feeling or texture feel older. Which is a GOOD thing. The artist's that picked by Eric Serra are good matches for the soundtrack. So grab your album and, a bowl of popcorn and, ENJOY!"
3,No glory but much death.,"This was not the book that I expected to read, and I don't mean this in a good way.To a large degree, Fradkin's goal is to pierce the illusion of the biggest marketing scam in North American history, that of Golden California. .... Comments such as ""modern California was founded on greed and violence"" only lead me to respond what empire wasn't? ...What saves the book is that Fradkin does love the state regardless of what has happened in the past, and he does know his history. ...."
3,What's it all about?,"I give it three stars because I think there is some beautiful evocative prose in Famine. I must admit, however, that the beauty of the language did not help me understand where the plot was going. Maybe the author wanted us to confuse the two Daniels. Maybe he wanted us to be so unsure of who did what to whom that we needed to fill in all the blanks ourselves. I thought Komarnicki's convention was ingenious, but I would have liked to feel that I had understood his intent when I finished the book. I think he could have fleshed things out a bit more for his readers. It kind of left me wondering if the time I invested in reading Famine could have been better spent reading a book that was both well written and understandable."
1,i'd rather starve than read famine again,"gAg! this book is so horrible i don't even know where to begin! here's the basic plotline: A guy is traumatized by the death of his younger brother, so he decides not to eat. So he goes into a clinic and meets a girl who doesn't eat. They are 15 years old but play under sheets in the clinic? Eventually they have a kid, i'm not sure if they let her eat or not. But anyway, the guy who doesn't eat starts a feeding place for homeless people.....but continues not to eat himself! And every other chapter is written by some boring detective guy, which makes the book further more uninteresting...the detective never uses the word ""the"" either, it goes,""i am detective. cop sees chair. cop takes coffee from secretary. cop says ""i have to pee"" To give you the basic jist....i couldn't even get through the whole thing it was so awful.....AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS!"
1,"In the future, cats are still aggravating","How much worse can the NEW EARTH series get? Scotty tries to fix a toaster. Kirk woos a schoolmarm. McCoy hunts for a missing cat. That's how much worse it can get.Spock takes longer to think up a way to cancel out the effects of a laser than does the average reader. A little boy dreams up the concept of a starship holodeck. The authors have taken their space-battle imagery straight out of ""Babylon 5,"" and their characterization of Kirk (""Report!"") from ""Voyager."" Even by STAR TREK standards this is not a good book."
4,Breathing Life into New Earth,"After three disappointing entries in the New Earth series, I found myself going into this book with a sense of doom. Must....finish....series...However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Flaming Arrow was truly worthy of being considered Star Trek. This book was well written and had a solid, space-based storyline. The side stories were entertaining as well and i enjoyed seeing the ""human side"" of at least a few of the Kauld.Unfortunately, you probably need to read at least the first two books of the New Earth series to make sense of this one, but the book itself is a good read."
5,Soulful Solid Comfort,"I bought this book for a friend with skin cancer and was so touched by it, I had to buy another one for myself to keep. The poems are incredibly healing, beautiful and inspirational. Whether you or a loved one are going thru Cancer or if you've known someone who has, this book touches the heart in so many ways. It's a must on any bookshelf!"
4,Keep on movin',This is a fun CD that makes you want to samba...be careful if you're driving though. You'll find yourself exceeding the limit rather easily.
3,Good phrases but limited beyond that...,"I bought this book to communicate with my spanish speaking nanny. It has some common phrases for baby care in it but still, I felt it was very limited in its coverage and the worst thing of all, it has no pronunciation!!! One bonus though is if you flip the book over, it has a Spanish to English version of the same pages for your nanny to use.I would still recommend this book but I would make sure you also buy Household Spanish. Together, they are much more useful."
4,30's musical icon,"I am a big fan old Warner Brothers Musicals of the 1930's. Most of these songs appeared in those movies - but they are NOT soundtrack versions. Emminently listenable 3-4 minute commercial recordings by Dick Powell that make the hour, or so of songs go by so pleasently. This is one of those CD's you bring out and play every so often and never feel like you want to part with it."
5,worked as said,"got the fobs within the time specified, had trouble with one, called and they sent me another one with no problems"
1,Worked for a short time,This key fob was cheap and arrived quickly. It was very easy to program and worked great for about two weeks. It suddenly quit working. We tried replacing the battery and taht was not the problem. Really diappointing because the reviews all seemed great.
4,Grab something thats bolted down..,"because this CD will rock you. Both are excellent, although I prefer CD2.. Tracks 5 & 6...whoa. If you like it dark & tribal, this is THE CD TO GET."
4,I liked this book a lot too,"This is a tight and powerful novel. It is more or less unique in Russian literature in that it is the story of a ""typical"" (i.e. non-socialist) family affected by the Revolution and Civil War. Bulgakov grew up in Kiev and his love for the city comes through very strongly. When I read this book I knew very little about the historical events it describes but this didn't prove much of a problem in the long run."
4,If you are interested in Russian history...,"WE had a Fascinating trip to Russia. It made us want to know more. For a different & unusual perspective, a great and informative read."
3,comment on the reviews,"as yet i have not read the book. my grandfather was born in a village near kiev in 1901. he, his father and brother left ukraine during the revolution. but the one thing he was strong about....you did not call him a russian. if you did he would get very angry and tell you he was not a russian he was ukrainian."
5,Excellent Keyboard,"First of all, it IS vista-32bit/Mac compatible. Thing with vista is you have to download the Vista 32-bit driver off their website[...]Pros:-Light-weight-Looks clean and very professional-Nearly every key/slider/knob is assignable-Cheap-Easy to setup-Works for both Mac & WindowsCons:-Userguide that comes with it doesn't show you how to do anything-Had to manually go to their website and download the vista-32bit driver.-Driver Installation CD only works for XP/Mac"
3,This is the Oxygen SILVER,I researched this on the M-Audio site as well as here - and this isn't the Oxygen 61 on M-Audio's site. This is a discontinued model and doesn't work with DirectLink Mode in Apple Snow Leopard - and there aren't any drivers available for it - nor do I see any planned.So - If you're looking for a Mac keyboard for GarageBand or Logic - you want the current BLUE version.I've given it 3 stars for fast shipping - can't tell anymore than that - and this needs a rating to post.
3,"Love M-Audio, this controller....not so much","This controller is great when it works. Easy to set up, Enigma software is great. That said, it is very cheaply made. I've had mine for two years now. I didn't even have it a year before I had to send it back to M-Audio the first time. I had one key that would play max velocity (super loud) no matter how soft I pressed it. M-Audio's customer service was great; they sent me a brand new board. The new board worked for around 6 months before the USB port started shorting out. Now I use the controller's MIDI output and an external power supply. Again, works fine for basic MIDI control WHEN IT WORKS, but wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3,The nicest man in Nashville is showcased perfectly...,"I thought this book was more of an extended review of all of his albums. It did not go into much detail about his personal life, although it did shed a little light on a few personal things (including his family). Overall, I would recommend this book, but only to those who do not know Vince Gill as the person. This book showcases his interests, especially in golf, and also his charity work. I think most die hard Vince fans are going to know alot about him already."
2,Very obvious she didn't interview subject,"Very dis-jointed...mentions his wife all thru the book, very close couple, then suddenly they are divorced, no explanation, no time-frame. If you read her notes on the final pages, you find out she never interviewed the subject...that's obvious!"
4,It's pleasant reading about an exceptional entertainer.,"It is obvious from the outset that Jo Sgammato loves the subject of her biography-Vince Gill. What's not to love-the man is a gem and happily, she does not dig for dirt, and respects his feelings regarding his recent personal losses. I found the book at times tangential, but still informative and it offers both a discography and outlines of his numerous awards."
5,I loved the movie.,For a young woman like me I like to see some older women who go out and make Baketball fun and more interesting. I have been playing basketball for 5 yrs on the high school league and I push myself to become a good player and every time I see this movie I like to try and do some of the great moves..
5,really cool,"this poster reminded me of my teenage years. I used this one and several others ( Batman, Superman, Spiderman, and Iron Man) to decorate the fence in my backyard for my son's 16th and 18th birthday. It was quite a nostalgia.William"
5,Good movie and fast shipping,This is a great movie and the shipping was fast and even though it is usewd. It is in excellent shape. Thanks
5,Lipton Savory Herb and Galic Recipe Secrets,"I love this product and cannot purchase it anywhere near here; I just wish that I could have bought it in smaller quantities than a whole case. At least I got it and am happy again that I can make the best chicken and vegetable oven bake. This recipe is no longer on the box, but found it online. The recipes on the box are also delicious."
1,Not the same as before.,"Lipton must have changed the recipe for this; it tastes the same but kept me up all night the last time I cooked with it. I have always loved using it in a recipe for chicken, but no longer; I will be giving it away."
5,Liptom Recipe Soup Mix,"I was very pleased with the speed that the product was shipped, since it was a food item."
1,Very Poor Quality,"The quality on this set is SO disappointing! The sheets feel like cardboard (even after several washings) and the threadcount is so low, you can see right through it! Unfortunately, I have scoured the web and these ""Dan Rivers"" bedding products seem to be the only ones that have Scooby Doo characters...Not worth the money. Go buy some Doo fabric at Wal-Mart and sew your own. Even if you've never sewn a stitch in your life, they'll be better than these!"
4,Not a true comforter,"This is a really cute set, but the comforter is barely that. It is more like a thick sheet and not very good quality. However it is one of the very few sets with Shaggy and Scooby together."
5,The Best Telephone Side-Cutters,Klein's Line-up of sie-cutters for telephone work is the best. You will not be disapppointed. This is a high quality american company. They make an excellent line of tools. This is great for a wide variety of telephone applications. These side cutters are always sharp.
3,tailgating with waffles,"I got two of these for a morning football tailgater on a college campus. Used with a standard propane grill, they worked well. The handles, which screw into the waffle iron, tend to loosen with repeated use (approx. 50 waffles in my case, using two waffle irons). Built sturdy and with adequate teflon, I would recommend them for a season. Not sure how they would perform using a campfire."
5,Makes great waffles while camping. A treat.,"We had waffles in while down at Havasupai. If I had to throw this product away after one use, I'd have got my money out of it. Fortunately it's just fine and ready for next trip. A wonderful little idea. We cooked using one gas stove, moving the iron every 30 seconds or so. I'd buy it again in a second. Love it."
3,everyone loves this.,"you too can be the most popular person in the camp... just bust this out morning or late night, serve up with whipped cream and fresh fruit."
1,Sampler?,"I'm familiar with a couple of songs on this cd, like ""Proud of You"" which is a very unique song of a father singing about his son.However, I played some of the sample songs and all I got was the orchestra, no Al Bowlly.I rather imagine this cd is a good representation of the 30s music but you would never know it from sampler."
1,Typical independent film,"In general, independent films tend to be more artsy than entertaining and that was very true of this. It was slow, too deep in symbolism and just not an enjoyable movie to watch. Probably more to do with the viewer (me) than the film itself."
3,Very True To Life,"After two adoption trips to Ukraine, I can say that this movie will have you laughing at its sheer reality. They captured the humor of an American matched up with a non-English speaking Ukrainian driver and his grandson. The story ends up with a surprisingly heart-felt ending that will almost choke you up. Just wish there had been a way to turn off or at least blank out some of the curse words in the Russian subtitles at times so that my boys could have watched it."
4,okay,"i love this movie!! and amazon did a great job shipping it. the only thing wrong with the shipment is, i believe there are some scratches on the dvd. besides that, everything's fine."
3,I really wanted to like it more..(than the book),"And initially, I did. But once the quirkiness petered out, that was it. Despite the profound subject matter, the film then simply became boring. No amount of prolonged landscape-shots, or meaningful silences in the cramped confines of the little car could sustain a promising start right up to the rather damp squib of an ending.Like with the book, certain devices eventually start to grate: The constant interpreting retards the flow of the narrative. Initially it may have served a purpose, but once the point about Jonathan being an outsider was made, and once the humour of Alex's translation had long been exhausted, this device, which in the end amounted to nothing more than a mere repetition of the subtitles should have been dropped..I thought the book was overrated, and I think the same of the film. Although I really wanted to like it, I could'nt.Louis M"
5,Everything,"I love this movie. It was a gift, as I have given many of these away. It is the movie that introduced me to Gogol Bordello music. super fast shipping."
5,Amazing,This is a fantastic movie. It is funny and sad in all of the right places. The entire cast does a great job.
5,Great movie,This movie is poignant and stays with you even months later. I have seen it 3 times and still see something new each time.
3,Quarky,The movie has a deeper meaning to it than what most people will see on the surface. It's got it's funny parts but it is also serious. It's an all around werid movie but I'll watch it again. Everyone should give it a try.
2,Doesn't hold a candle to the book,"Regrettably, I saw the movie before I read the book. DO NOT make the same mistake. While the movie in and of itself is enjoyable, it doesn't even come close to capturing the sheer glory of the novel. So don't go out of your way to see this film, but you absolutely must read the book."
2,Minority report,"I read a lot of reviews about this film here, and I see I am in the minority here, but this film bored me to tears....It had a couple humerous moments but wasn't funny. It had a couple touching moments but wasn't touching. I thought it just sat there and nothing really happened. Couple that with the total unlikelihood of Jonathon hiring the one tour guide in the Ukraine that had an affair with the one person in the Ukraine who knew what had happened...No...I don't buy it, and I don't buy into the total ""we hate all tourists and Jews attitude""... It was 105 minutes of borrrrring. Even the dog was unbelievable. No one in this film would be found in reality. I like eccentric chracters, but when every character is eccentric, the movie is just pointless. I think the final nail in this film's coffin for me was when the old lady asked: ""Is the war over?"" Did anybody really take that line seriously?"
3,Terrible adaptation; great movie,"Had I not read the book prior to seeing this film, I would've been delighted by it. The acting--especially Eugene Hutz, who steals the show--cinematography and pacing are great.But having read the book, I can only say I'm disappointed. Leaving out the fantasy flashback sequences doesn't bother me--it's understandable given their strangeness and how disconnected they are from the road trip narrative. But why did Schrieber decide to change so much of the rest of the story?Excising parts I understand. Shaping, trimming, modifying, I understand. But there are distinct things in the story that have been entirely changed for this version, and unnecessarily so.On its own, this is a delightful film, but the adaptation unfortunately takes my rating down a notch from where it would otherwise be."
3,Disappointing for Foer fans,"I enjoyed this movie for what it was - mildly entertaining and aesthetically pleasing. However, it bears so little resemblance to Jonathon Safran Foer's novel that Foer fans will be likely disappointed. The ending was completely altered and characters changed to such an extent that the movie can only be called an adaptation of the novel in the loosest of terms. Without the back story interwoven, the plot is thin, illogical, and at times, difficult to follow. I would be interested to see Foer's own reaction to the film; personally, if someone shredded apart my critically aclaimed novel in order to tack on a vague feel-good message, I'd be livid!"
4,One of my favorite movies....,"I enjoy everything about this movie....the actors, the humor, the characterizations,and the way it is interwoven with the seriousness of the history behind the story."
5,Illuminations,"I love this movie. Don't expect high speed chases and explosions. It is witty, sad, beautiful, funny and most of all, illuminating.Of course, my favorite character in the movie is Alex, followed by Sammy Davis Jr, Jr. Alex is played by Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hutz and gives a superb perfomance! Sammy Davis Jr, Jr is Granfather's deranged seeing eye dog. Did I mention that I love this movie??"
4,we all need illumination,"Having been born in Eastern Europe I could like this movie just for the irony poked at the youth culture portrayed by Alex, the young translator and the very early post-communist look of Ukraine. But there's a lot more to be liked besides the packaging. The movie digs deeper and faces us with existential questions about life and faith. What will you do when the final test comes. Will you be ready to lose your life for what you believe in, like Lista's father or if you have a second chance will you be willing to change your faith in order to survive, like grandfather?"
5,A somber perspective...but a relevant one.,"A must see. it helps you see humor in tragedy and tragedy in humor... needless to say, the transition was effortless and delightfully unexpected."
5,It's like a cleaner PG-13 version of Borat and Schindler's List,"This movie is hilarious... and very touching. Definitely not what we expected. The 1st half is highlighted by the Ukrainian guy hilariously butchering English similar to Borat but PG-13 rated instead of R rated, and the 2nd half is fairly serious and tear inducing similar to Schindler's List. There are a few off color jokes me and the wife could have done without, but we still loved it. Loved the soundtrack too."
4,good balancing of dark comedy,Very good narrative AND AESTHETICSemotional but still uplifting and funny at the right moments.Sun flowers and tears all lead to happiness.
2,DVD Problems,The movie is classic but unfortunately the DVD is not as good. We had numerous problems with the DVD because it would not play properly. It froze twice and had poor visual display three times. This is the only DVD that we have ever had problems playing.
5,Everything Is Illuminated,Excellent service. This movie arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I watched it immediately. Thanks for providing it at such a good price and for sending it so promptly.
4,Great Movie. Need to watch it twice.,"This is a great movie. It did not get much attention, but is a great film. The decision to come at this story from the travel guide's perspective is wonderful. Highly recommend this film."
3,Useful but not well organized,"This is a useful review of the biology & ecology of primarily the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) with occasional references to its Eurasian cousin C. fiber. The book presents quite a bit of information on beaver ecology & behavior with references to the primary literature. The drawbacks of the book are its poor organization & the poor quality of most of the B&W; pictures in the text. The lack of efficient organization results in the duplication of similar information in separate parts of the book often without cross-referencing. For example, beavers' food is discussed in chapters 4 9 & 13; mortality & predators in chapters 10, 11, 14 & 15. As a result, it is difficult for the reader to receive a clear synopsis of the subject matter. Several of the B&W; pictures suffer from poor exposure to the point of being useless (for example, Fig. 3.1).The standard on beavers remains to be written."
4,difficult subject to cover and explain,"I had no idea Weather or Meteorology or Atmospheric Science would be so difficult but this has helped explain what I am watching and listening to with the ""Teaching Company"" lectures on ""Meteorology: An Introduction to the Wonders of the Weather"". I wanted a companion book but nothing can compare to the course with the graphics and charts on the lectures. I had the Dummies book on Weather but didn't like it in the least. Maybe it was outdated as I couldn't find most of the terminology Dr. Fovell used in the lectures. This is a better but still not as good as some CIG books and I have read most of them on all topics over the years."
2,Discouraging,"Not helpful, unfortunately. The advice is not practical when your husband just flat-out doesn't make enough to support the family on his own. Also has the smug, holier-than-thou tone that many SAHMs have. :( It's funny - most women I know would give anything to be a SAHM, but I have yet to meet a SAHM who makes it a point to compassionately intercede for those of us forced to work outside the home. At most, it's a trite, ""Oh, I'll pray for you,"" that is quickly forgotten and you never hear from them again - they are too caught up in their SAHM world. I should have returned the book, but never got around to it."
3,Traveler life,Intersting good life all those years ago. Not the same anymore. Glad I read it. Would like to read more on the travelers life
4,great for beginners,"I really like Sara Ivanhoe's workouts because she explains each move thoroughly keeping you aware of your body alignment. These workouts are great for time crunch days. It's a little basic for avid yogis, but for beginners or relax workout days it's perfect!"
3,great for beginners,This was one of the first yoga dvd's I purchased over a year ago. Sara is a good instructer and explains the poses pretty well. My only issue with this dvd is that I grew out of it pretty quickly. Between classes and other videos I was doing the workouts became very boring and too easy. But this is a great option for someone who is interested in yoga but nervous to jump in.
5,Today I am beautiful,"Serah, I ve been recommending your yoga makeover to many of my friends. I di not find any DVD which helped me do yoga on my own at home. I m not a gym person and therefore I made one gym at home. And you are an essential part of it. I could not find any easy instructions to follow. Anyone can do it. You are like a personal instructor to me."
3,Some good things & some not so good things,"This has beautiful scenery, and she is very pleasant to watch. It's pretty slow. I was planning to do two back to back, but after one, I had barely worked up a sweat at all. If you want something VERY easy, this is a nice DVD. BEWARE if you have bad knees. Mine aren't particularly bothersome, but she does A LOT of things on the knees. Even if the DVD was faster paced or more challenging, I would not be a fan of this one for that reason. It is also a little annoying that the same intro and roughly the same ending (a tad too mystical for me) are on each segment. She is a good instructor if you need clear cues."
5,Superb,Extremely happy with dvd. Especially with yoga on the ball as my favourite medium due to knee reconstruction. Unknotted and untwisted my back issues beautifully and feel sooo much stronger.Excellent instruction from Sara. Really knows her stuff.
1,Not the type of yoga I expected,"When I think of a ""yoga make over"", I think intense yoga work out.... and this ain't it! This DVD is a joke! I personally don't want to just breathe and stretch, I want to sweat and feel like I'm transforming my body. If you are a busy mom like me or busy person in general, strapped for time and looking to make your yoga workout count, look elsewhere... I HIGHLY recommend Jillian Michales Yoga Meltdown- you will love it!"
5,Great Product!,"I've got these on both of my laptops. Love them. They raise/tilt the laptop for easier typing, and they let more air circulate for better cooling. I highly recommend them!"
2,Eh...,"The bumpers fall off easily, despite the velcro. I'm pretty sure I threw them out after a few weeks. Next time, I'd invest in one of those lap pad things...but these are good for a quick fix, or if you don't move your laptop around much from your desk."
4,"Nice, But Need Improvement!!!","Overall, it is above average phone. I would say 3.5. It has nice screen, which is easy to browse thru. With bluetooth, you can connect to other devices and share your files. The speaker is not very clear. A stereo headphone is recommended for MP3 player. There is static at the other end when connected to a bluetooth headset. The phone does not have voice calling (this is a feature every bluetooth enabled phone should have!!!) I got drop call sometimes, but this is Cingular. It's expected."
2,Samsung Ignores Warranty - won't replace lost Battery Cover,"After 5 months, the battery cover fell off and was lost. No idea where or how.Samsung won't replace the part, despite their 1 yr warranty for ""defects in materials and workmanship.""They simply do not have the part in inventory - and the battery slips out easily, without the cover.The web shows that Samsung has a similar attitude for other products - stereo, tv, etc. They ignore their warranty, and stonewall the consumer."
3,"Makes a good first impression, but...","I've had this phone for about five months now, and thus far:Pros:-Awesome display, bright, high-res-Fast (for a phone) internet connection-Compared to most other phones, this has a great camera-Nice, sturdy buttons-Personally, I get a huge kick out of the MP3 player touch buttons on the frontCons:-Relatively slim, but still pretty heavy and bulky-Ring volume is fine if you're alone in your room, but ambient noise tends to drown it out pretty quickly-BIGGEST CON and the main reason I'm getting a new phone: The battery life started out okay (maybe three days on a charge), but in the past month has completely DIED. If the phone isn't charged every single night, it won't last (I give it 36 hours, maximum, for a single charge). My dad has the exact same phone, and the same thing happened to his."
4,"Good phone, a few issues","I've had two of these, the first being black and the second being blue. I like this phone but I'm afraid there are a few too many issues with it for me to consider a 3rd one. Here are the two biggest problems I've encountered:1) Durability. I dropped the first one a lot and it actually lasted quite a while and only started to malfunction gradually, making the break predictable. I was super careful with the second, only dropped it a couple times and just a few days ago it snapped in half. Waiting for a new Slvr to come. Neither phone held a charge very well, at most held one for a couple days. Otherwise, it would just die within 24 hrs.If you're going to get this phone, be extra careful with it and expect problems with the battery life/charger. Otherwise, the other problems are rather trivial and the phone's menu setup and everything is nice."
3,"Overall design is good, but they missed a few details","Overall the design and functionality of the A707 is good. 4 issues I have with it:1. It frequently refuses to switch to a non-carrier owned tower. I know this because I am on ATT and I have verizon tower within 200 years of my house. On an ATT tower I get one bar. On verizon's - 5 bars. But I have to reboot the phone to get it to change towers.2. The memory card slot requires too much insertion force, which eventually causes the latch mechanism to fail. When this happens you can kiss using a micro SD card goodbye.3.The battery compartment has too large of tolerances, letting the battery wiggle enough to cause the phone to cut off.4. Both front and main LCD's still use glass substrate instead of plastic, which means if you every sit on the wrong way ... Crack and your buying a new phone.Call quality and features are good. Durability - not so much."
2,Nice songs but unsatisfactory sound quality,"Mostly accompanied by himself on the electric guitar, this album has some nice songs in it, such as ""Going Home Blues"", ""Seems Funny Baby"", ""Fast Life Woman"", etc. The drawback, however, is the backgroud noise. You may feel bored after you finish playing the whole CD."
3,Unclear at Times,"This is about a Russian youth who enters the space program in the Soviet Union. There is a lot of satire in the work. Unfortunately, a lot of it loses its punch, either because of the translation or because of the writing itself and it takes a second reading of the book in order to ""get it."" I have a feeling, however, that if handled right, it could make for a good movie."
4,Geoff look,"""Oman Ra"", by Victor Pelevin engages it's readers with anecdotes exploiting the lack of sophistication on projects related to the Soviet space program. I reccommend this book for many reasons. This book is beautifully written and it flows with excellent word usage that consists of many layers. Pelevin also creates an eerie sense of humor(dark humor). Dark humor is shown when Henry Kissenger visits Russia. The Russians, who want to leave a good impression on the U.S show Kissenger (an american), their hunting skills. With no game to hunt, the Russians dressed a small boy up as a bear and killed him as if a he was an animal. The book is also exciting and compelling. This is shown through Oman's different paths he chooses to take. I recommend ""Oman Ra"" to anyone who seeks a different wild and inventive story."
1,Omon Ra: Let it be burned.,"Omon Ra is garbage. I would not suggest you read it if you care for good literature. It is just another boring collection of Russian senetnces patched together in short paragraphs that make absolutely no sense. Unortunately, most of Russian literature is like that."
3,The dark side of the moon and everything else,"Absurdist fantasy and dark political allegory don't combine for easy reading and Omon Ra is a good example of this. It is perhaps only afterwards that one can begin to make sense of this strange tale, but it is certainly worth sticking through to the end. There are so many interesting themes to this short work which rates three stars and not more as it loses its balance somewhat for a while. The narrative may be bizarrely Soviet but its subtext is universal. Viktor Pelevin provides a traumatic account of youthful dreams exploited by delusional ideologues, the abuse of power, damaged people perpetuating a dysfunctional social order, and noble purpose becoming tawdry sacrifice. We don't have to go all the way to the dark side of the moon to find our own dark side it seems."
5,"Thoughtful, touching, satirical","This was a novel I encountered in my search for fiction and sci-fi from russia and eastern europe, to vary my usual diet of british and american offerings in the same genre. I'm glad that I did.Omon Ra is entertainment from start to finish, following the main character Omon from early childhood right through to his adventure into the unknown. It's hard to say much about this without revealing huge pieces of the plot (and I just hate reviews which do that), but there's a lot more packed in these pages than just the basic story premise.It's one of those books that can be read on more than one level. It explores friendship, patriotism, the influence of authority and the burning desire to explore the unknown (and the known). It's bleak and depressing at times, and at others it's emotional and very touching.This was the first of Pelevin's novels that I've read, and it's a certainty to say that it will not be the last."
4,An Outer Space Nightmare,"This is one of Pelevin's best: a tale of delusion and false hope about the space race in the Soviet Union. The setting serves as a metaphor for the absurd state of things in the Soviet Union, its overly-glorified space program, and the damage done to entire generations of people who found that their country could send people and objects in outer space, but could not produce disposable diapers or disposable syringes. Pelevin aims for the grotesque and the absurd and, in this book, he is rather successful."
1,Useless!!!!,"This purchase was a total waste of money, would not recommend to anyone. I had to throw the entire pack away after one attempt it JUST DOES NOT WORK!!."
1,Be Warned,"I bought this because my xray showed a perfectly ""STRAIGHT"" neck. I do not have neck pain, but thought this would improve the curve and help me age without pain. Well, I started using it and was so excited to be sleeping on my back all night for the first time in my life. I was comfortable. The problem is, I started to develop daytime pain in my mid and upper back. It took me a while to realize it was probably this pillow doing it. So the pillow messed up my back!! I also had another xray after using this for a few months and my neck was the exact same STRAIGHT neck as in the original before the pillow xray. I have quit using the pillow and slowly the mid and upper back pain seems to be going away. I hope there is no permanent damage :("
3,Cervical pillow works - but so do others,use the cervical pillow regularily - works but I think other types sold in stores do the same thing - directions that come with the product are horrible - photocopy that you can't really read- been re-copied too many times. I'd look at other options and compare prices before making this purchase.
4,you need it,"It will have some kind of muscle sore in the beginning, and after few days, the stiifness and pain will relief.I think it is better than those memory foam pillows, or you may use a rolled towel under your neck."
1,CAUTION - do not wash in washing machine,"I bought this pillow 18 months ago along with several others - looking for the perfect fit. I find I never use it under my head so for me it was not the correct solution. But I wanted to warn others about washing it in the washing machine. The label says to preferably surface wash it, but due to other circumstances I needed to thoroughly disinfect it with bleach so I put it in the washing machine as I would any other polyester filled pillow. This one absorbed so much water it must have weighed 20 lbs. That in turn affected the washer's spin cycle and in the end severely damaged the washer to the point it was cheaper to replace rather than repair the washer. A very expensive experience - be warned."
5,Good support,Comfortable to sleep on it. Support the neck correctly and make me well relaxed. The height is about right. Relieve cervical pain to some extent.
5,I can sleep again!,"I've suffered with neck pain for years and bought just about every cervical pillow known to man. This pillow is a perfect fit. It maintains proper alignment of my head and neck so that I am able to relax, fall asleep, and wake up without neck stiffness or headaches. It is much more comfortable than other pillows that I've owned. It is not as ""hard"" as some, yet it maintains its shape and cervical support for well over a year before needing replaced. Works well for back or side sleepers. The price might seem daunting, but it is well worth every penny."
5,Great!,"I have had problems with my neck for over thirty years, and I have wasted a lot of money on neck pillows in that time. This is the best neck pillow that I have ever tried! It supports the neck, while not being to hard or too soft. It supports the head when you roll on to your side. It provides very gentle traction, so that it is comfortable. I have had some pillows that were too uncomfortable to sleep on. I imagine that people with different sized heads and necks might have a different experience, but I think it is great!"
5,My neck actually stopped hurting!,I cannot recommend this pillow highly enough. I have severe neck problems that often radiates pain through my shoulder blades & arms. The day after I slept using this pillow the pain literally stopped. I was completely shocked. If you have any neck or shoulder pains try this pillow - it is really comfortable (both on your back & side) and really works.
1,Not Impressed,"This pillow really gave me the worst stiff neck and headache. I am glad it works for some people, but it seems that it is a very expensive lesson to find that it does not work for you!"
4,Pillow Helps,"I've used this pillow for over a month so far. The pillow is a little uncomfortable. Its hasn't gotten rid of my neck/shoulder pain but I have noticed a reduction by say %50. I notice if I don't use the neck pillow for a night my neck discomfort the next day increases. Overall, if you've lost the natural curve in your neck and get muscle spasming, this pillow will help."
4,Unique ergonomics--works for me,"Due to neck pain, this is my 7th or 8th ergonomic pillow purchased over the yrs, and I kinda like it. It has a unique design that is quite comfortable/helpful for back sleeping. To sleep on my side, weirdly enough, it is more comforable if I flip it over and lay on the edges of the underneath side. Small price to pay though, in order to make it through the night. All other props and pillows that I used to go through on any given night are currently stuffed in the closet."
4,Cervical Linear Traction Neck Pillow,The first night with this pillow only lasted 1 hour before I switched to another pillow. I gradually would sleep on it for longer periods of time until now-it is the only pillow I use. My neck is so much better plus I feel like I sleep deeper. It is working for me.
4,Helpful but not for side sleepers,"This is a nice pillow and gives a nice, gentle stretch to the neck. it only worked for me while on my back. I am a side sleeper so it didn't help much. Excellent for a back sleeper."
3,The idea is good...,"This pillow should come in two sizes. One for men and one for ladies or smaller persons. I found that my head did not fit into the identation, since my neck is smaller. I can see, though, that a larger person would benefit from this pillow."
5,Neck Pillow,I had neck pain for several months when I decided to buy this pillow. I found it extremely comfortable from the first time I used it. Within a week my neck pain was gone. I was really quite amazed. I highly recommend the pillow. I feel it was worth the money.
5,Neck Pillow,"I had my doubts about this pillow at first, but after this first night......I sleep without any stiff neck, back ache or shoulder aches. I used to sleep with three pillows every night and I would always travel with them also. I highly recommend this pillow."
4,It worked for me.,The pillow took some getting used to but has helped relieve the symptoms associated with a pinched nerve in my neck.
5,Rid of headaches and Ibuprofen abuse,"I purchased this neck pillow 2 months ago, and I have not had a headache since! I used to suffer from head and neck pain for years along with taking way too much ibuprofen just to survive. I have not had to use ibuprofen in 2 months, and I have had a much easier time concentrating, focusing and reading. Seriously, this neck pillow has made a huge difference in my life. I honestly bought it on a whim, but I have been pleasantly surprised by its results. Fantastic pillow!"
4,Felt the difference the first night,"After months/years of neck pain, numbness and tingling in arms and shoulder pain,I was desperate for relief. I had tried some other cervical pillows but none seemed to make a difference. I was very hesitant to pay the price asked for this pillow but figured pain free sleep would be worth it. I noticed a difference after the first night. I used the traction side for just a bit right before going to bed and then flip it over to use the other side for the rest of the night. I sleep on both my back and my side and it is comfortable and effective either way. Now I think I will probably be buying one for my spouse."
5,cervical pillow,This is the best pillow I have ever used. I slept very well the very first night with no jaw problems.
3,pretty good,"I bought this pillow after the tri core pillow to try it out on a friends recomendation. He is a bit taller than me so has a longer neck than me, which I think is why he likes it so much. This pillow is comfortable to me sometimes, but sometimes seems like it is a little to large for my neck. And if you are sleeping on your side this pillow is too soft for that. But for on your back it is good. But if you are shorter like me, I am 5'4"", you may like the tri core pillow better too. The arc4life pillow does have the alternate side, but it is too soft. The tri core pillow has the larger and smaller sides about the same firmness which I like, and is firmer if you sleep on your side."
1,A Big Disappointment: DIDN'T WORK!!!,"Didn't work at all like it was described. When I bought it through Amazon, it was $80+ (in mid-2010)...now a little less, I noticed. The pillow does not support but pushes your head away or in a crunched position. Not at all what we were looking for! I'm sorry to have wasted my $$$. :("
3,So so...,Not very satisfied with this product. The hole in the middle of the pillow was little uncomfortable and expects you to sleep in same position entire night.
2,Ok Pillow,"I didn't see much improvement. It is comfortable, but doesn't really help my neck. I know I wouldn't pay this much for the pillow again."
4,More restful sleep,"I've had a neck condition for about a decade. This pillow has allowed me to get more sleep through the night. It took a little while to adjust to the pillow (e.g., having to stay in better alignment while in bed), but once I adjusted, I noticed less stiff necks and more restful sleep, once I get up."
1,Absolute waste of money,"another of a long list of products that ripoff people in pain. A simple low flat pillow is what I found worked best for me, after a lengthy trial of this and other expensive pillows."
1,Didn't work for me,Did not find this pillow comfortable at all. It was very difficult for me to lay my head in the right spot without my neck hurting more.
