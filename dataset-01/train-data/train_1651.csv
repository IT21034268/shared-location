5,Good case,This is a slick little case. My Powershot SD1000 fits perfectly and the magnetic closure snaps smartly into place.
2,"Bought this case for Canon Elph 300 HS, small camera, big and not so comfortable case...","Well I am a Canon lover, always had Canon Cameras so this time I bought the Canon Elph 300 Hs.As I always do, I bought Canon case for protection. The camera is one of the tiniest Canon I have ever seen, but this case is too big, so what you win on size with small camera, you loose it with this case for sure.The other thing is that it is tuu hard to push the wrist strap thru hole, so if you want to take pictures with wrist strap on place (wrist), and the case hanging on the wrist strap, it will be VERY VERY VERY difficult, uncomfortable, and tight.First tiem I give 2 stars to a Canon product.Hope will be the last! :)"
3,Nice case though a bit of a silly color,"Works great. It made a shiny line on the face of the case (I very carefully place the camera in the case facing forward in case the front lip of the case might make that line appear on the view screen).The slot on the lid is a mystery to me. Is it meant to allow the wrist strap to be pulled through? If so; do I have to re-thread the strap every time I replace it in the case?The color of the case is a bit lighter than in the picture. It is more fuschia than burgundy. I am not quite a fashion victim, but I guess I would have gone for the grey case had I known it wasn't really burgundy.The belt loop is plenty wide and when on a belt the case rides at a comfortable height.It is certainly a good case for the camera it is desgned to protect."
2,Canon Case,Case is very attactive and fits the camera great. However it is not very practical. It has no additional storage for extra batteries or memory cards. It does not serve my needs. If all you want is camera protection it is fine.
2,No pockets at all...,It holds and protects the camera just fine. One problem... No pockets at all. There isn't any room for an extra memory card or card reader. A little disappointing.
4,Good quality case and excellent protection for Canon camera,"This case is a must have for the Canon digital camera. It provides just the right amount of protection without adding too much bulk. The camera fits in snugly and is easy to remove. The only thing that I find strange is the cutout in the flap for the camera's lanyard. If you feed the lanyard through the flap, then when you take the camera out of the case you have to pull the lanyard back out too. Kind of defeats the purpose. But overall, I would buy again."
1,broke after a few weeks...,"My camera fitted and the case looks OK, but after just a few uses the strap that allows attaching the case to a belt broke at the upper seams, without me noticing. I was lucky that my new camera survived the fall AND that somebody pointed out to me that I'd lost something..."
3,camera case for cannon,This was a gift for my wife. It fit the Cannon camera perfectly and offers very good protection while not looking like camping equipment.
4,Brief Comment,"The hole for the wrist strap is not big enough for the adjustable plastic thing on the strap of my camera (that thing that tightens the strap around your wrist). Other than that this works well for protecting my camera.***Brief Comment - I'm really just trying to contribute to the ratings on amazon without having to write a full blown review, what needs to be said has already been said in other comments***"
1,"OK, but it has a very annoying flaw - shame on Canon!","This case is a good snug fit with an SD1200IS. It has one near-fatal and surprising flaw.Canon supplies a lanyard with all the SD camaeras. That lanyard is looped through a bushing on the camera body for easy carry.The lanyard has a largish joint where the thin cord that loops to the camera bushing in joined to the much thicker cord that makes up most of the lanyard.The camera case has a hole to accept the lanyard. Unfortunately, the hole is too small to let the joint of the lanyard pass through it without a struggle. So you either don't use the hole or struggle with the joint every time you want to use the camera.Really dumb design on the part of Canon. I mean REALLY dumb. Makes the case nearly useless except for storage."
1,This case does NOT fit the Canon SD-1000 camera!,"This case may look nice, but once you receive it and realize that the hole is too small for the camera wrist strap to fit through, and that the case won't latch closed with the camera in it, you may regret your purchase."
2,Not quite satisfied : - (,"Color and look was alright, but I had to return it since it was tight for the camera."
2,Fits the camera but does not close,The camera fits into the case but unfortunately the front flap does not close. I ended up returning this items because of this reason.
2,This is not burgandy...and some other issues,"This product is more like reddish pink than burgandynot only i was disappointed with its colorbut if you look at the product more carefullyits surface of the case is not smooth as it appears to be on Product Photoits more like a crocodile-ish leather type...which makes it lookwhat some old-ladies will be carrying around...i give 2 stars cuz it does protect my camera...but like other reviews says, don't expect any storage for cables, memory card, and etc. Its whole for strap sucks too...very inconvenient when i want to quickly take out my camera for photo shoot.Only thing i like is...Canon logo..."
4,OK for what it is,"I bought this case after reading a lot of the reviews, so my expectations were adjusted accordingly. It is exactly what I want, a streamlined protective leather case that is compact and still allows me to slip the whole package into a pocket, etc. As many reviews have said, it will not hold anything but the camera itself. I did not want or need extra storage in the case, so I am happy with it."
2,Bad Idea,"The case is a nice looking case. This is my third Canon Camera and I ususally the ""clasp"" on the case is velcro. This case has a magnetic clasp which is not very strong. the case keeps flopping open at inopportune moments. I wish they would have used velcro."
1,quality,"this is product looks like nice but if you are looking for a case who it protect your camera, like i was, in my opinian this it isn't the best choice."
2,Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Grey Leather Case,The case is fairly nice and adequate. It would be a lot better if it had a small pouch for an extra battery and memory card.
5,Great Camera Case,I purchased this camera case instead of the case logic zipper case to protect my camera when it's rolling around in my purse. This works great and it's very easy to get the camera out quickly for those spur-of-the-moment shots.
2,Pretty but not well designed,Looks good but no room for spare battery or memory in addition the camera fits so snugley its hard to remove from the case.
1,Not good with a lot of wear,"I like the small and sleek look which I why I purchased this case. On the very first use, the belt strap broke. The belt strap is not constructed very well. It broke at a graduation and I didn't even know it until my husband told me he picked my camera off the ground. Very scary to think I could have also lost my camera too! Looks good but is made poor. I did call the company and they gave me credit back on my credit card. That was good customer service."
4,Seems snug,"This product seemed a little snug for the cannon PowerShot I bought with it. It's felt on the inside so in theory shouldn't scratch the screen, but I'm more used to loose camera cases and feel a little uncomfortable every time I slide it in and out. Otherwise a very nice-looking case."
4,sleek,The carrying case is very sleek and sophisticated. I just wish there was an inner pocket to place extra cards/batteries.
2,Doesn't Fit SD960IS + Non-impressive Quality,"I just ordered the SD960 IS, and Canon lists this case as one of the two compatible ones. So, I ordered this case assuming that an original Canon case will be the best fit and worth paying $15. However ...1) The length of the case is not enough to fit the SD960 properly, so the door doesn't close easily. It's only after pushing it in a little to force the softer bottom part out that you can close the camera. (I tried the other listed case model at Best Buy, and doesn't fit properly either! Great job Canon!!!)2) As others mentioned, the plastic part of the wrist strap doesn't go through the open spot on the door3) The build quality of the case isn't that impressive either. The front and back material looks OK, but the sides not so much."
3,Too much money for so little,I was a little disappointed for the amount I paid for this camera case & it holds only the camera. No room for an extra battery.
2,I simply don't like this case at all. Go for case logic instead.,"I have a case logic with my canon sd600 and I like that case a lot as it looks nice, padded, easy access, holds battery and sd card, etc. It was the perfect case. I got this canon case for free with my canon sd1200. It's terrible. First, I have to take off my belt to put it through the case. Second, it doesn't hold anything but the camera. No battery or extra sd card. Third, it doesn't seem as protective as other cases. Lastly and my biggest problem is that it is way too tight. The camera is like jammed in there and I have tightly squeeze my thumb and fingers to pull it of the case. That means I am getting thumb prints on the screen and accidently pressing buttons. I love cannon products but this is their first bad review from me. The camera is much better then the case."
2,Design engineers?,"Poorly designed. There is no easy way to keep the case attached to the camera while shooting, if desired. No opening for the safety cord to run through."
1,Case for camera,The leather case we purchased for the Camera did not fit and the lid could not be closed - all around too small for the camera.What a waste of $13.00Jim Alavekios
2,Wrong color,The product was received in a timely manner but was the wrong color. I ordered a Grey leather case and received a Black leather case.
1,Badly designed case - look elsewhere,"BADLY DESIGNED CASE! It is way too snug - very hard to take the camera out or put it in. The hole at the top is too small to work with the strap suppled with the camera, and worst of all the magnetic closure does not close! Mine is going straight back."
1,Don't buy this,"The case looks good and is made well, but the camera fit is to tight its hard to remove and worst of all the camera does't go into the case far enough so that the cover will stay closed. It would help if the cover had a snap on it but it does't."
4,Perfect...well almost,"It fits my SD1000 perfectly. However, the strap hole is a bit troublesome when you're trying to take the camera out of the case. You get use to it, but they could have designed it a bit differently."
1,Not Made for Canon SD1100 IS,"When I received this case the package stated that it was compatible with the SD1100 IS. However, it is a very tight fit, and then the magnetic clasp would not hold. Plus the case will definitely not close with the wrist strap attached to the camera. This renders it useless. I returned the item."
4,Only one complaint,It works well and protects the camera well. The only complaint is that the hole for the strap is too small and you can't pull it out easily.
2,"Below expectations, Better off with PSC-55.","Leather is stiff and thin, which is not evident in the online pictures. If you want a comfortable, leather case that will protect your camera, and even comes with a leather strap, go for the Canon PSC-55, for a couple extra dollars."
4,More than what I expected,"I have seen this movie/musical twice on LOGO. I must admit at first viewing I was not expecting it to be a musical. However, I watched it and thought it was just OK. When I was able to catch it a second time, my perspective changed. There was a lot of talent and a few stand outs in this performance piece. There was some comic one liners, spotlight performances, and a few surprises like a performance by Ledisi @ the funeral scene. The contrast/comparison likens this to the documentary of Paris is Burning but this is so much more. It's still ""theatre"" but more contemporary with relevant topics beyond the ballroom scene. I mos def plan to support by purchasing a copy."
5,Leave It on the Floor,"I loved this movie, the story line, plot, chorograph, music. It brought me back to the days when I use to frequent the clubs in NYC. I had to have it in my collection."
1,"really, really bad","5 stars for this? I just can't believe it. Everything about this cd is bad. For music lovers out there- don't throw your money away. This cd is so bad i would not use a cd-r to record it on if I could get it for free. I sometimes buy cd-s based on reviews (that's how I got to listen to Erik Truffaz-for example) but this time I was wrong. Mediocre guitar playing, rythm machine and some singing that puts you asleep. ""Purple haze"" version is beyond ridiculous. Sounds like some kids that just got a new K-mart keyboard and they think they can do music. And it came on as you might also try... when I was checking out ER by Nills Peter Molvaer. ?????? Honestly, I couldn't even listen to it once. Yes, that BAD."
4,Nice warm socks,I enjoyed that these socks didn't run too small. They are nice and warm/plush but pretty easy for my 20 month old to pull off. I would order these again.
4,"Great value, good quality, run small and are thick",These socks were are very good price for the number of pairs. I got the 18-36 month size and they fit my 12 month old perfectly. They are very thick so his shoes fit a little tight when he wears these socks. I have washed them quite a few times and they seem to be holding up well.
2,not what I ordered,"I ordered these socks for my 2 year old daughter & received socks sized 0-6 months. I did not send them back though because I have another girl due in July and I figured the baby can wear them. But be careful if you order these - you may get something that you can't use! Another thing that I wish I knew before I bought these was that these are thick socks - more for winter time, not spring or fall time."
2,Not what I expected,"The book might be ok for a very young reader. However, from the summary and from the other review, I thought the book would be helpful to a young person with a telescope (to help them find what's out there). I just received the book today and am returning it because it will certainly not be useful in this way."
3,Problem after 6 months,"Installed camera. I actually don't mind the colors but it failed after working 6 months. Picture started to look blurred and it got worse until it was unusable. It is possible it is due to water. The camera is under an eve but could get wet assuming rain falls heavily. Very disappointed with this camera, particularly since it was bought to replace a lorex camera that arrived defective in a four camera DVR system. Since I shipped this out of the US its too expensive to return for warranty.Update: Raised review to three stars...it was the power adapter that failed. The camera still works. I am keeping the rating at three stars due to the power adapter failure but think that I would buy more of these cameras due to the field of view they have (quite large)"
3,Some colors are incorrect,"I can confirm previous reviewer's observation in regards to colors. Some black, blue or violet closing appear as various levels of green. The picture is good othervise.Night vision is good when objects are close and are at the same distance. One of my cameras is mounted over the entrance and is about 8 feet high. The field of view is pretty level. Night vision is perfect. The other one is mounted about 10 feet high over my driveway. It gets retaining wall in its view, at about 6 feet away. The wall looks very bright but the rest of the driveway is very dark. I suspect it is focusing too much on the wall so the rest just fades out."
3,Came right away thanks,Works fine came right a way Thanks Service was fine on this camera. But never did get my battiers That order on battiers sucked
3,Nice add-on to your deep sky photoset,"The small side prism delivers substantially more luminiscent imaging of the fainter stars than one could actually expect. However, manual guiding might be a real challenge, especially, should your option is limited by Alt-Az GoTo mount. Therefore I suggest to get prepared to study auto-guiding software and test your RS-232 port communication. Also, in order to use Canon EOS 300...450 models, you need to obtain additional extender ring, because the radial guider's winding-in will be obstructed by the dimentions of the built-in EOS flash."
2,Radial Guider,Nice concept. I own 5 telescopes including one schmidt cassegrain. This won't fit or work with any of them. So I wasted my money buying it. But it sure seems like a neat concept...too bad.
2,snow cone maker assecories,This product is good except that the only flavor mix in the box was grape. My understanding was that diffenent flavors came with this item.
2,way below follies standards,"ok, follies were always kind of cheesy, but in a zany way with a lot of clips. something went severely wrong with this edition, probably that the people they put in charge were wackos. for 40 minutes, there's very little field action, just mostly cheesy overdubs of sideline talking, like ""hey bill, where's the bathroom... hehe, i gotta pee"". worse follies ever... sad"
2,"Good idea, poor quality","The bath sponge fell apart with the third use. The grabber is cheaply made. It is all plastic and the ""fingers"" have nothing to help grip. The only useable piece is the shoe horn - si price is outrageous for a shie horn!"
5,Great Glove,"In my 25 years of playing baseball I have owned 3 A2000's. This glove, like the others, maintains it's high quality manufacturing. Now if you are reading this to find out whether or not to buy this glove or one similar...take into account that the A2000 is not a glove that is ready to use the day you buy it. These take use and some TLC to break in. But once they are ready there is not another glove like it. One new feature that I like is the internal wrist pad that is no longer the furry cushioning that most gloves have. They've changed this since my last A2000. It is a breathable padding that won't get crusty or worn out with use. The glove has excellent craftsmanship and a deep pocket. Recommend to anyone playing baseball or softball."
4,Desert Blood is a Mystery Thriller for young adults,Lot's of twists and turns makes this book very interesting. Author really drew me into the characters then threw some surprise characters at me.
5,crossword puzzle book,It comes in a timely manner every month. The price greatly beats the newstand price.
1,Why Pay for It?,I was able to take the first few words and copy/paste to a Google search. What did I see? The article for FREE. Why would anyone pay for this. Research before you buy anything. I do and save tons of money
3,Good collection,"Having lived in Chicago for many years and being a huge blues fan, I can say this is a good collection. It's not the best but it is above average. Good variety of artists, all well chosen, and the sound quality is acceptable. If you like South Side style of Blues then you will be satisfied with this cd."
2,Not to my taste...,"Dried fruit can be a great snack and was looking forward to the mixed fruit. I'm sure this is not just an issue for Mariana but after opening 3 different bags, I couldn't get past the horrible smell and somehow when all the dried fruit is in one bag each fruit item almost taste the same. Anyway, I'm sure if you don't mind the smell, these are not only good for you but a good source of sustenance, especially handy for traveling."
4,"Ok, but not the best","I didn't purchase this fruit from Amazon, I got it from my own grocery store.The bag I bought was very heavy on the plums but they were good. I didn't like the apricots at all, they were huge and had some sort of grit on them that crunched my teeth when I bit in.A positive though is that everything was nice and soft - even though it's called dried fruit for a reason that doesn't mean I want petrified. Also all the pieces of fruit were larger than what I usually get, at least two bites per piece."
1,natural looking lipstick,A little too drying for my taste and the lid keeps coming off. Color is okay.
5,A+,"Triple 6 is the best, i listen to this cd like no tomorrow. All the tracks just put me in a mood that makes my day, it's pretty bad ass. I's recommend buying"
1,Don't waste your money,It would be less of a waste of money to climb to the highest point in your state and throw all your money off the top! You and your family are better off climbing/hiking as much as you can and keeping a journal. The book is boring and pathetic in its ill attempts to be witty. And that's not mentioning the pathetic climbing advice. The amazon website documents that one of the authors is in college while the other two have graduated from Yale. I found this surprising as the caliber of writing made me assume that the Birrer children were much younger. Just save your money and have fun outside with your loved ones!
3,This book was average but nothing special,"I disagree with the previous reviews except that this book is not a travel guide. Anyone fooled by the title be sure not to purchase it. The title is deceptive too, it is not a guide of the 50 states and their respective highpoints. Please be more specific!!!!"
1,Someone in need of attention?,This book is a complete waste of your time. Totally filled with self-righteous gloating that makes me question the validity of their stories. Do us all a favor and throw this book and make room for something better on your shelf.
4,Not A Travel Guide,"This is not a travel guide, in the narrative sense. I was expecting a book that had many chapters dealing with their travels across the states. Because it is not, I would have given it 3 stars. However, even though I have several highpoint guides, this one is a welcome addition. I think the second edition of the Winger's book is still my favorite, but this one has some highpoints (pun intended). This book has more items for the family -- things to do in the area. It also has a good couple of chapters on the necessary preparations for highpointing. For that, I would give it 5 stars. However, some of the highpoints have very slim descriptions of the actual hike. For that, I give it 4 stars. Overall, 4 stars."
2,"A ""video game"" novel -- that doesn't exceed expectations.","The ""Brute Force"" is a trio of space-marines who act as enforcers for the Intergalactic Confed (think Trek's Federation -- if it were run like the Mafia). When the marines stumble upon some corrupt dealings of Confed officers, the ""Betrayal"" part kicks in; they are conveniently sent on a mission that they have almost no chance to survive. This book consists mostly of gunfire and lobbing grenades, so don't expect ""The Grapes of Wrath"". The characters are disappointingly undefined. They are simply generic sterotypes -- Male Marine, Female Marine, and Cyborg. Whereas ""Halo"" was a video-game novel that exceeded expectations, ""Brute Force"" lives up to them. I will give it a bonus half-star however for the surprise (gutsy) ending."
2,Very weak action novel,"After playing Brute Force, I expected something like what hapenned to me after playing Halo and devouring the 3 Halo series books: just and plainly being amazed about the gathering of sweet writing around a very good game.I enjoyed Brute Force, but found the book very weak up to the point of finding it boring. The book starts right in the action (very pale by the way) and develops slughishly through the paces of diferent operative misions. By the time it starts to get momentun; voilá, the book is over!!! No good whatsoever. If you really want to get hooked in a game-based book, get the Halo's series, or Crimson Skies, and you will be delighted."
3,water timer,"The product is well made, but is not as easy to program as claimed.It works well once it's programmed."
1,"Lousy design, cruddy performance","Where to start? The cover won't stay up. Have fun programming it like that. I finally taped the lid up. There are 4 watering cycles, but the length of each cycle has to be identical. That means you can NOT have it turn on at 7 am for 2 mins and then at 10:30 for 5 min. This unit is not humidity proof let alone waterproof. The batterry compartment does not seal at all. There are large holes in the battery compartment that lead directly to the electronics. Huh what? I'm guessing that since this is an Israeli designed product and Israel is a desert country they don't have to worry about rain and humidity. Despite the programming limitations, I put my unit into service and less than a year later it failed. I didn't bother to get a warranty replacement, this product is so pathetic, it not worth the effort. Do not buy."
4,Good Story - But Needs Pictures!,"Very well written, puts the reader there with the sailor, but having so many descriptions of the world-class sailors throughout the book, it would have been really nice to have had pictures (close-ups) of them & their boats! The only 2 pictures on the back jacket cover where far away & small. Sigh."
1,Drown Me Now!,"If Derek Lundy were attacked by robotic space baboons and whisked away to their fantastic-yet-deadly planet...he'd still tell an incredibly boring story about it. Good god, was this book boring! I mean, what an incredible story, and he just sucked the life out of it like a vampire. Did anyone edit this thing? It would've made a fine magazine article, but as a book, it held WAY too much filler. And Derek, OK. We get it. You like French people. Whatever. Gah. I wanted to throw this thing out the window, but I was trapped with it on a plane. Two thumbs down."
2,What a disappointment!,"Despite an interesting topic and well-researched storyline, Mr. Lundy's presentation left a lot to be desired. Was this a postmodern attempt to present a non-linear chronology? I can't say. But his writing is not strong. And the structure he chose to frame the tale did little to give me, as reader, anything to invest in. Knockdown is much better!!!"
2,Repetition,"An interesting book. However it should have been shortened by at least one half. Lundy simply begins repeating and repeating the observation that sailing the Southern Ocean is dangerous, high winds, big waves.I found myself simply glancing at the pages after the halfway point as Lundy continued to repeat this message. OK. The winds are high, the seas are high, you are alone and far from land. Geez, that's not too hard to understand."
2,ADD on the ocean,"I have to agree with the others who have bashed this book. The writer meandered around way too much telling this story. If he had structured the book differently and cut down on the break aways from the race itself, it would have been a much better book. For pities sake, three quarters of the way through the book he starts to tell a story about himself as a young boy, AND HE WASN'T IN THE RACE!!! Great subject matter, poor writing."
1,Poorly writen,I felt that the book was poorly written. The writer jumps from subject to subject and to me there was no continuity to the book. The book and the subject matter could have been presented in a much clearer form. The writer would take off on a tangent and a couple pages later return to the original theme of the chapter. The book came across as if the writer didn't have enough material to write about and had to head in different direction to build pages. I would not purchase another book by the author.
4,A Thorough Dissection of An Amazing Race,"This book hovers between the thrill of reading an exciting story about life and death situations during solo sailing on the open ocean and the tedium of absorbing a barrage of information about the world of sail racing. Still, Derek Lundy manages this balance with reasonable skill. The story is well researched and the writing is competent, if at times a bit heavy. My only real complaint is that the flow of information could have been better organized to make it easier for the reader to keep track of the characters and their constantly changing status during the race. Well worth the read if you have any interest in stories about people who risk their comfort and their lives to endure and survive earth's most challenging environments."
5,God Forsaken Sea,"A most satisfying read. It combines the excitement and terror of single handed racing in the Southern Ocean with insight into the people who did it in the 1996 Vendee Globe. It reflects their thinking and attitudes in the light of Montessier, Slochum and Saint-Exupery. I agree with the Time assessment that it ranks with the best of books on sailing."
2,A Tough Read,"This book was a tough read. Not in the sense that it was technically overbearing, the challenge came in the form of continuing with this style of writing. The ingredients were there but the author made little use of them, often grasping for content. The script is tedious and often tangential. The writing fails to present the reader with the true essence and magnificence of the Vendee Globe."
5,Godforsaken Sea,"Godforsaken Sea is one of the best books I have ever read, particularly as I have sailed in the storm that wrecked the Fastnet race in 1995 so have some idea of what the single handed commpetors sailing round the Antartic endured.They were surfing down waves 30 meters high under full sail at 40 knots and if this was not enough had to gibe a 200 square Meter spinnaker at night without any help. Moreover it was not safe on deck so this is a stupendous feat.They could lose a rudder from flotsam and had to do all repairs to rigging alone.It is a pity that the paper-back edition does not have the photographs"
3,"Exciting parts, but poorly organized with weird sidetracks","I enjoyed most of this book, but found myself confused for the first 2 chapters as to where it was going (the first chapters bouce all over the place). Also, the author doesn't seem to have a lot of experience with sailing, which gives him an almost ridiculous awe for these admittedly very talented sailors in the race. The author is very very repetitive about the character it takes to sail at sea for so long, etc... Unfortunately the repetitiveness and confusing interruptions of the flow of the story (sometimes up to 40 pgs long) really interfered with my enjoyment of this book which has probably about the most exciting plot you could imagine. I found myself amazed that I could spend so much time being bored while reading this book. I think the editors must have had their eyes closed while reading the draft of this one."
3,"Somewhat tedious at times, but overall a good story","I also felt that the material was repeated at times, and the book wandered and skipped back and forth. It was hard follow because of this. But overall, the content is what you read this for, not Derek Lundy's writing skill. The story is excellent and more than makes up for weak organization."
2,"The ""glass"" was half full.","I have read several books about the Vendee Globe, and the BOC, and in most cases have been riveted by the ferocity of the sea, and the the hardships these sailors faced. But this book was disjointed, and disorganized. Several times the author begins to take you into the fearsome southern sea only to digress into the technicalities of yacht construction...back to the sailors risking their lives...the history of the round-the-worlds...back to the sailors, etc. But near the start of the book he reaveals the dire straits some of the competitors are facing, and then shortly after places people thousands of miles away from their perils. Near the beginning of the race. Start the book at least half way through, and still be prepared to skim read. I'll give this book away."
4,Answer to the quiston,The reason why he sings I want candy in this song so many times is becuse I want Candy was made in the 60's! Its not Aaron song ^_^0
1,Stupid teenybopper,"THIS IS THE WORST SONG I EVER HEARD!! (apart from anything by daphne and celeste). You'd think he would get a slightly more intelligent sounding song now that hes a big boy. I want candy, i want candy, i want candy i want candy repeated x500 over an annoying repetitive beat and then you have this song. This got to #32 in the UK charts, LOL!!"
1,Eeeeeeew. Not him again.,"Another CD from him where he thinks he can look like he's 29 on the cover by dressing fancy. The song is old and worn out. He needs to get a life, better yet, a better career, because he's certainly not good at this one. (And as for the Instrumental, we don't need MORE people singing this.)~Twin"
2,Fell apart before I could use it,I think it will work fine if I can improvise something for the spring mechanism. It fell apart immediately. It's so cheap that I didn't bother returning it.
1,Rip Off,They should tell you up front that these are miniture. They are not the regular size of guys. This is like a trick.
2,Dissatisfied,I was rather disappointed with this purchase. Rationales are not given to the questions. I would have also liked to have divided sections on topics and then maybe a couple of full practice tests at the end.
1,Gerontological nurse Practitioner Certified Nurse Examination series,"I was very disappointed in this book. The book is comprised of test questions with no rationales for the correct answers. Some of the questions are exceedingly easy and general so that without even studying the content, someone with half brain could figure out the answer. I had my husband, who is not a nurse, try a couple of the questions and he of course answered the questions easily. It looks best in the picture- with the cover closed."

5,Best Toy Saber Out There!!!!,"Don't bother to shop. If you can't afford the replicas and this is for your kid, he will love it. But don't buy Yoda's or Darth's. They are all different in color, vibration, size, light intensity, etc. This is the one to buy. Don't bother with the others even if you have 2 or 3 boys. Just write their names on them."
5,Star Wars Light Saber,"This product was a hit with our friend's 3 and 5 year old boys - these were birthday gifts(one for each) the ""clash"" noises were very realistic. The lights were really neat too. They played with them for hours. The battery compartment is easy to get to with a phillips screwdriver. Ok - I admit it, I am 36 and I want one! Really fun, kid-friendly toy."
4,Great Lightsaber,"This is a great lightsaber, after i did thisObi-Wan Kenobi Lightsaber, June 5, 2005However, I found a simple solution. If you carefully unscrew all of the screws, beginning with the battery cover, and carefully pry open the two sides you can see the motor. Try and locate the red and black wires connecting to the motor and cut one of them. Make sure to either cut a section out or move the severed ends away so they don't rub and still complete the circuit. Voila no more annoying vibration, but still the sound and light. I understand some work is involved, however it's worth it.Than it was sooooo fun to play with its skinny and easy to handle,but the fact that the lightsaber part doesnt go in all the way is weird but that made it much skinnyer the other lightsaber's are huge compared to this one, and it only makes one sound effect when you hit something that gets annoying but overall its great!!!"
5,An incredibly important and well-made film,"This is a really well-made film (I was shocked at how well-made, because the filmmaker was not a filmmaker before she made Farmageddon) that tells its stories and communicates its information and message powerfully and succinctly. It's both educational and inspiring.The stories Farmageddon tells are the stories that NEED to be told - ones that tell the truth about the corruption in the food and agriculture industries in the United States. Until more people start telling their stories, the oppression and corruption will continue. We need more many, many more films like Farmageddon."
4,Good film...scary,"Overall we thought the film was well done. Somewhat balanced on opinions, though sometimes hard to know if you're getting the full story. The narrators voice is not the best for film, in my opinion."
3,Too much about raw milk dairy farms,"Although I understand this movie was wanting to expose what is happening to our small farmers/farms. Unfortunately, it ended up, to me, sounding like a commerical for raw milk. There was just too little about any other type of farms even though the title of the movie suggests otherwise. I couldn't watch more than 1/2 way. Although raw milk is in my opinion definetly better than pasteurized, I am against dairy in general. I think it is problematic for humans and I didn't want a sermon on how good dairy is for us when I think otherwise."
3,It all boils down to liberty vs. egalitarian statism (tyranny),"If we want the government to be our mommy in other areas of our lives, why not food? Now, don't get me wrong - i happen to concur with the premise of this film entirely. The irony is, that many of the same people who are up in arms about the government's meddling in our food choices, are generally the same people advocating for more government (i.e. controls, subsidies, and special privileges for special interests) in most other areas of our lives.In other words - you have no grounds for complaining if you are one who continues to vote for progressives and democrats, as they are the ones most responsible for the encroachment of the federal leviathan against our own self-interests. Of course, my assumption is that our self-interests have to do with preserving individual liberty and promoting personal responsibility over collectivist ideologies."
5,more than another organic farming documentary,"This is an indictment of our government and the bureaucracy that it's become. ""Why do they hate freedom so much?"" is the best question the film asks. We need to stand up for our food freedoms, but we need to stand up for people wanting educational freedom, freedom to build their homes with alternative materials, people who want to travel unimpeded, people who want control of their healthcare, etc. I'd love to see this video find it's way into schools for kids to see and discuss these issues."
5,WOW,"The things I find out from documentaries, things I've suspected actually happen.All for th sake of $$$$$$$.Sometimes I just simply say wow."
4,Shockingly Informative!,"Everyone should see this to find out what's really going with our food situation in this country! If everyone were required to watch this film, in addition to Food, Inc., I think we would be on our way to a healthier, more environmentally educated population."
4,Government; too much or too little,It was good to watch. There is a need for government over site. The balance of too much or too little has always been the challenge.
5,Must Watch,It's amazing what the government and Monsanto will do to keep farmers and consumers in the dark. This documentary clearly shows their tactics and the force that's used to scam families out of their hard earned work and disrupt communities.I encourage you to watch and share this with others and those who have the power to do something should do something.
3,Better than you would think...still,"Get the originals if you don't already have them. If you are an ATR completest this is about half good and half not so good. The best song is Unitus's version of Death Star which might be better than the original. Great beat and vocals. Other highlights include Rabbit Junk's Start the Riot, Howard Roark's No Remorse and Schizoid's The Future Of War. Lowlights include Ctrler's Deutschland Has Gotta Die which is marred by whiny vocals and DHC Meinhof's Revolution Action which has bad guitar work and muddled vocals."
1,bad quality image with stylish base,"The camera I was sent is a USB VGA PC Cam. I downloaded a driver from the Flexcam website to enable it to work on my ibook G4 which wasn't too difficult only the image you get is very poor. It looks very stylish on its 'moon' base and the flexibility and portability is great (you can detach the camera from its base and the flex cord is self supporting) however, it was a waste of money to but a camera that doesn't take very good footage. The image is pale, grainy and regardless of how much light you have around you everything just reads too dark. There are other products out there that are just as cheap that give you a much better image."
1,Horrible,The batteries only lasted a week. Any even when I bought new ones (which are around 9 dollars) it still didn't work. LAME.
4,Kool Shen is the best,"It does'n matter that ntm is no more, kool shen is doing his job well. this is a pretty good album.This is his style check it out.for more info about kool shen check outwww.autentik.lx.roor www.ivmyPeople.com"
1,Vegetable Steamer,I have boughten two of these veggie steamers just for the fact that it's very hard to find other varieties of steamers. I rated this one very low on the fact that even though it works well - when you go to clean it you have to dry it immediately or it will rust. It says it's dishwasher safe and I guess if you don't mind rust with your veggies it is.
2,not satisfied,"Not worth the purchase, it does give off some light to see at night, but not with any clarity. The range is short. Probably a night vision camera or motion lights would be the best option."
5,Easy to use,"This is an easy to use textbook that teaches revit building with a lot of ease. Each chapter teaches you how to create a part of a major project. You can learn most of the required tools in the process and create any architectural project in no time. Its not a comprehensive book, but not all of us need A to Z of revit building (we have help for that). This book teaches what is required to be productive from the first day."
2,Disappointed,"Typical CAD instructional book, very basic and very difficult to find specific answers to help. Also too many excercises and tutorials. Any suckers out there want to buy this from me ?"
5,DermaPet Eicosaderm - Outstanding!,"I took my 120lb Rottie/mix, Beau, to a new vet for his 9th birthday checkup and some chiropractic massage. (He deserves the best!) The vet recommended this product for his skin and coat. Within a month of adding it to his food, his fur, which had always been course, was ultra soft, fluffy and shined liked it was glossed! He loves the taste, and he is shedding about 90% less. That makes ME happy (black fur on white ceramic tile..ugh). Here on Amazon I got the product for $25 less than the vet charged. Definitely will be back for more!!!"
5,Excellent!,This company provides a quality product in a professional and timely manner. I would recommend the product and company anytime because I have ordered from them several times with excellent results.
5,I got to have Product.,"I had to take my 1 year old Chocolate Lab to the Vet for an injury. He turned out to be fine, but we asked about the flaking on his skin. The Vet recomended this product and we will never go without it again. We not only use it on the Lab, but started to use it for our Jack Russel as well. The flaking has gone on both Dogs and what a wonderful job it has done to make their coats soft and shine. At this price it is about half the price we paid at the vet. I will be back to buy it again for here."
5,Focus on Winning,Take a walk inside the mind of the tennis player. Find out what should be going on inside the successful player's mind during a match.
4,Learn how to win from an overachieving master,"I played tennis for a long time without the results I really wanted. This book helped to fill in some of the holes to help my game. It is a very easy, quick read. I didn't like that it went so much into minor details like what is in the tennis bag. What I really liked was the blow by blow description of how he won some big matches against Becker and McEnroe. Also, his explanation of basic strategy types was very good. I've watched Brad play many matches live and he is a master at mentally undressing his opponent. He is a perfect guy to write this book. I do agree with the reviewer who said it will be better for the intermediate player than the expert but still would recommend it for any player."
3,Entertaining but nothing an intermediate+ player doesn't kno,"This book was rather mediocre in my opinion. It was very good at pointing out the obvious (i.e. try and win the important points). I didn't really need that advice given to me from a book. Also, I was expecting much more of what the title suggests, ways to ""win ugly."" None of that. I got the lowdown on what points are important, I guess what points you should *really* try on as opposed to *just* trying.It just didn't do it for me."
4,very good help for a recreational player,"the tips provided in this book really worked for me. i was able to resolve some technical issues with the mental game.i never took lessons from a coach, but this books seems to work like one."
5,Great for tennis and everyday life,This book is motivational and fun to read. The advise to activate your brain and start using it is very applicable for any situation not just a tennis match.
5,Winnin Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis -- Lessions from a Master,The best tennis book I've ever read. Brad gilbert is a tennis genius and a very good writer. He has a keen sense of humor which is just in his personality - he writes the same way as he speaks (you can see him on TV a lot during the tennis tournaments). In this book he describes what is going on in player's head and what should be going on up there. He teaches how to be mentally strong during the matches. He also gives some very good practical advice on how to improve your strokes and how to play different style players. Very useful book for a tennis player. I'm going to re-read it again - every single page has wealth of valuable info.
4,Men's Tennis,"This book was very helpful for improving my game. I would give the book five (instead of four) stars had it not focused exclusively on men's tennis. For example, in the section about stocking your tennis bag, the suggestion ""bring an extra shirt onto the court"" obviously does not apply to women and no alternative is suggested. The ""Learning From the Legends"" chapter does not include a single woman player. Otherwise, it a great book."
4,If you are a club doubles player...,"This is an excellent book - but, in my opinion, more for the singles player. As a doubles player, I did like it, and the parts on mental strategies also apply in doubles. I would still recommend it, but not if you are looking for any kind of doubles strategy."
1,Reading Ugly,"This is a self-indulgent ego trip for Brad Gilbert. It has a few interesting points, but in general it's simply Gilbert talking up his own experiences and telling us what a wonderful player he was. Despite 40 years of professional tennis, Gilbert uses only his own games as examples. I saw him play many times; he was not exemplary enough to justify the bombastic arrogance he shoves in the reader's face page after page.There's little new here that has not already been written about in many other, there are better sport psychology books or autobiographies of great competitors. Gilbert only describes situations, he does not set out techniques of how to compete under pressure, focus, counter negative tactics, etc.The writing style is unsophisticated and puerile, more suitable to a teenager's frivolous blog than a book.One positive: his chapter on game preparation is worth reading."
4,An Interesting story,We play quite a bit of tennis and fou d the perspective by Gilbert to be interesting. A good value.
2,Modern Producers with reconize this as a history book,"With the changes that we have seen in agriculture it would be hard to keep a book current. this book shows good basic concepts used in agriculture, some of which date to the 1940's and 1950's. Modern agriculture has change enough in recent years that this book would require a massive rewrite to be called Modern."
3,"Good, but Not as good as EYW","here are the songs on this album i recommend to VH fans: fragments, wash way, the man who would be santa, angel w/out wings."
5,this is the BEST cd and band i've ever heard,"I recommend Vertical Horizon to any one with good musical taste. They are amazing. Ever since my sister got me into them, a year ago, i haven't put the cd down---i even bought their older and newer ones. They are amazing!"
2,disappointed,"If you expect this CD to sound like Everything You Want or Go, you will be disappointed. It's more of a folk music sound and not at all what I had hoped for."
1,disappointing..,"recently received this cd. already have ""everything you are"" and enjoyed that disc very much. unfortunately this is a complete change of town. very religious sounding songs, reminded me of the band ""jars of clay""certainly a different direction for the band, one that lost my interest."
5,Emotionally Stirring,"This Cd is amazing. It is more relaxed than Vertical Horion's newer Cds. When I listen to it, the singers drive home their purpose, and each word cuts right to you. ESPECIALLY in Wash Away. I love that song, and I am in love with Keith Kane's voice. This CD was at first just another addition to my Vertical Horizon collection (which is growing by the day) but now I am sure I will never be so obsessed with a band."
4,"Don't expect ""Everything You Want"", but still a great listen","For those of you who don't know, this album is a wondeful example of the Vertical Horizon many of us have known for nearly 10 years. The VH from before ""Everything You Want"" had NO electric guitars, NO rock edge & virtually NO musical substance. However, these things aren't always necessary to produce an extremely enjoyable album like Running on Ice. If you are a little open-minded and can get past the fact that this band tried to make it acoustically for most of the 90s, failed, and then totally reinvented themselves just to get a record contract, you may enjoy the album. If you enjoy James Taylor, John Denver, Jackson Brown, etc. you will probably love it."
4,Finest Spice I've Seen,"This unique spice blend was worth every penny. I used it on a flank steak, marinated with olive oil and lemon and it was the best I've ever done. Still have a few more meats to try it on, but it will certainly not go to waste! I'll be buying more of this one!"
5,Great spices,This is a wonderful blend of spices and can be added to most any dish to add a little something extra.
4,Bar BQ Judge & Cook,This book provides a cook a basic knowledge of corn meal and flour. From the knowledge obtained from the book a beginning or established cook can prepare all types of breads. Further more after reading all the materials a cook can be creative with flavors and new creations.
1,NOT WHAT'S ADVERTISED,"in the ad it definitely says Speed Demon Carb. When it arrived the instruction manual & bag say Road Demon. I see that a new tag of the part number 1282010 is on the box so I am assuming that it was a road demon box used for a speed demon carb? why would this be as product condition states ""NEW""? this is concerning as there is no product number on the actual carburetor to note that is truly is a Speed Demon. the box was obviously not new and the carb has small blemishes. I would never order from them again and returned the item immediately."
3,Functional But don't expect Sony features,"I bought this battery for my Sony CamCorder. So far I have charged & discharged this battery battery 5 times. It last about 1 hour & 45 minutes in my camcorder for recording. This is about the same time I was getting out out of my original Sony NP-FM50 Battery.With my Original Sony NP-FM50 battery charging indicator would stop at 120 minutes charge. But this one passes that & keep going up to 480 minutes then it stops & show ""Full"". I know this battery will not give me that long. Then when I take the battery out of charger all of the sudden it drops to 130 minutes or so (got different reading every time). So if you are buying this battery, it works & it is functional. But do not expect to get an accurate battery info reading & reporting from your camcorder. If you do, you need to opt out of this $8.00 battery & pay $35.00 or more & get an original Sony battery."
4,"Good product, good price","The battery is as advertized and works well, a little less capacity than the original, but overall a good buy. Fast shipping too!"
1,Does not hold a charge; is not worth a money,"I could not believe to my eyes when my Sony camcorder reported a projected recording time of 242 minutes with this battery! If only that was true.Unfortunately just on the next morning after being fully charged my camera simply did not start, to my surprise. Battery charge was gone overnight.I guess I have nothing to add - this speaks for itself."
2,The theory takes second place behind the people,"The book is mostly about the personality and adventures of Hoffman. I was quite disappointed at how light and glossy the treatment of the science backing up the theory was. I'm still looking for a book that covers the theory more than the personalities. I suspect that the publisher realized the problem with this work and that is why the hardcover was called ""Snowball Earth : The Story of the Great Global Catastrophe That Spawned Life as We Know It"" while the later paperback version is called ""Snowball Earth : The Story of a Maverick Scientist and His Theory of the Global Catastrophe That Spawned Life As We Know It"". The change is subtitle reflects the primary focus of the book. The people and personalities, not the theory and science."
4,Up close and personal. Theories and Controversy.,"This book provides wonderful insight into both an interesting and controversial theory, and the personal and professional struggles of those who debate it. The author pulls no punches in describing the egos, strenghts and foibles of the various protagonists. They are sometimes seen as heroic, other times as petulant.The author comes down a little too strongly in favor of the Snowball Earth theory, but so well exposes the controversy that her particular opinions are not given undue weight. The reader is left juggling many of the same balls that the scientific community is currently dealing with.A quick but delightful read. Certainly worth the investment."
5,Great look at an exciting theory!,"I first heard about the Snowball Earth theory when I saw a documentary about it on the Discovery Channel. I'm usually more of an astronomy fan, but that documentary fascinated me. I picked up this book following that on a chance sighting, and it did NOT disappoint. The book covers the theory, in layman's terms, and the personalities behind the theory, both for and against.I think that the few poor reviews here are due to a misinterpretation of the book's purpose. Taken as a book meant to actually make a profit by interesting everyday readers, it was excellent. ""Science snobs"" who feel their points of view under-represented may take offense, but for the rest of us, thank you Miss Walker."
1,THIS WILL SCREW UP YOUR COMPUTER,"I got this program, having more than 30 gig free on my hard drive. I tried to partition a part of it to add another OS, and it had an error in the middle of it, and now even my original OS will not work. THIS PRODUCT IS CRAP. Anyone thinking of purchasing it...think again, and be prepared for a migrane."
2,"It is cheap, but you get what you pay for.","I purchased disk commander to be installed on my Windows XP machines with NTFS partitions. The software immediatly will hide any non-booting partitions from Windows, that are not recoverabe via Windows XP.Thus I lost a drive and all its data. Luckily, I had made boot disk number 2 and was able to get it back. Note, during this process, I ran out and bought Partition Magic that doesnt have these hokie issues.ANyway, getting the drive back was not as easy as this sounds, since the software didnt tell me it was hiding a partition, it took me a day or so of panic to figure out what the software did.I dont recommend this to anyone that are using Multiple NTFS partitions. In fact, I have 'circular filed' this app and now use partition magic."
4,Nothing new from 2000 except the XP support,"Nothing changed from the 2000 version but the XP support. the looks might be pritty but if you dont use XP, dont buy this thing."
1,Adding Dos To XP,"Please, don't buy this if you want to add DOS to a computer with XP. I used their Partition tool to create free space for DOS. When I installed DOS through their OS wizard, it moved my XP partition and all of it's data. Now, XP doesn't fully boot up. I had to reformat my NTFS partition and reinstall XP. If I had known this, I wouldn't have bought the software. On Microsoft support website, they tell you how to install dos, then XP, and have it dual boot. So, save your money."
1,Worst movie ever! Do not buy this garbage.,"Terrible. I just bought it today and figured out it was fake about two minutes in. And of course they advertise it as ""real, real, real"". It went straight into the trash can-30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. May the producers, actors, and writers all die in a fire."
1,Fake Garbage,"This is not footage of real underground fighters!!!This is a docudrama with bad actors and even worst fighters... all designed to promote their crappy online gambling website, that will never work because the producers were too dumb to realize that the name fight night has already been copyrighted by EA for their videogame.They interview actual fighters to try and lend it credibility. I wonder if they knew they were interviewed for something fake. They must have just paid these people.Seriously, don't waste your time on this. I wish I would have read the other review before I brought this on some other website."
2,A bit depressing,This book was a bit depressing - there is no doubt that what the Chinese did in Tibet was horrendous . . . and depressing. But this book doesn't stop -- its just one horrible thing after another . . . I thought Patrick French's Tibet Tibet gave a better overall feel and balance for what has happened in Tibet over the last 50 years.
4,Fantastic Footwear,"These shoes have been great! They are light, airy, and have held up very nicely. I'd highly recommend snatching up a pair right now!"
4,was the first book on bodybuilding but,yes it was thefirst book onbodybuilding published in the late 1970 .s but now in this new century pumping iron warriors are much more impressive . would need and update.
5,Deliciolus!,The Mariani Philippine Mangoes were absolutely delicious! The next best thing to eating a fresh mango. I have placed an order twice and plan on ordering more in the future.
2,"Way TOO sweet, not that good","Even since I brought a bag of dried mango from a Snack store in Chicago, i've been addicted to dried mango. I tried all sort different brand of mango since i don't want to drive 3 hours to Chicago just for dried mango, still i couldn't find the one that was like it. And when i saw a good review for this Mariani brand Philippine Mango (and outside the bag says ""BEST TASTING MANGO IN THE WORLD!""), and i thought that must be very good. Well, i was WRONG. It was too sweet, they added 25 grams of sugar in a 4 oz of dried mango, it was too much for me anyway. The slice of mango was a bit too thin, and it wasn't as chewy as i like it. I really don't think this mango is the best taste in the world, because i had some that were way way better than this stuff. Now i have no idea what to do with 11 bags of this, i guess i'll just give them to my friends."
1,awful,I love Luna bars but the s'mores is awful. It tastes like dirt. It tastes NOTHING like a s'mores. If you are looking for a bar with that s'mores taste I recommend Clif Kidz bars in the s'mores flavor. A million times better and it actually has less calories. I'm a fan of Luna's but they really missed it on this one.
4,Good daytime camera,"It's not a .1 lux camera as Amazon states. Lorex says it's a 1 lux camera, but good lux seeing anything when it's that dark. Used indoors or in daylight it does a very good job and it's nice and small so you can put it pretty much anywhere."
1,Terrible translation,"The Turkish is different from the English. Example: guleriz guleriz..and their english translation said it means smile often when in fact it means, we smile, we smile , literally ( smile we, smile we). Every page has mistakes like these. Another example: sonra gulmeye baslariz..meaning- later, we start to smile. Literally, later smile to start we, but since it doesn't make sense in English, Later we start to smile is sufficiant, however, their translation.... Smile big... Um..what?? "" Buyuk gul "" Lit (big smile) means this, not what they wrote in Turkish!!?? The translation is horrible. They needed to take more time to make this a more accurate translation."
5,I felt as though I was sitting in the cockpit with Rudy,Rudy Billberg's experiences from from barnstorming to bush piloting as told to Jim Rearden portray a uniquely rich and exciting era of American history. I felt as though I was riding in the cockpit with Rudy buzzing everything from golden wheat fields in the midwest to brave grizzly bears in the Yukon. Bill Rohovit (bill_rohovit@we.xerox.com
4,fabulous racquet for the price!,throw away the walmart racquets. this is the better value. The strings are tight and the handle and frame are sturdy. Not super lightweight but great for casual games.
2,Not very pleased,"I bought this because it's cheap. For the price, it looks good. But very heavy even beginners should not use this kind of raquet and hurt your wrist"
3,...,"It's okay. Mine's been reviewed (by certain unnamed badminton freaks) as-not a fake (thank goodness)-headheavy-warped frame-stiffand etc.adding a remark to an earlier review for this product, my wrist does hurt, although the exact cause hasn't been pinpointed, it could be the racket. (it could also be the fact that i'm still not sure if i hold it ""ergonomically correctly"")."
4,Good product,This racquet feels much better and handles much better than another racquet that I had purchase. It's a great piece of equipment for people who are starting out with badminton.I recommend it.
2,Way Too Loud,"For the price and for being a fluid bearing(supposedly)fan this one doesn't make the grade. I put back in my 5 year old sleeved fan because the noise this one made was unbearable. I wish I had listened to the one other reviewer's comments but I assumed this person was overly critical or may have hearing sensitivity to certain pitches. Since no one else complained and since my PC sits 20 feet away from me I took a chance. Big mistake, don't waste your money or time if you're looking for quiet. I gave it 2 stars only because it does have good airflow but you can get this in a sleeved fan with less noise."
2,"Good airflow, long life, BUT TOO LOUD...","I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the noise. This fan makes an ""electrical buzzing"" noise and a horrible high-frequency whine that sounded like my ears were ringing. Not really loud, but it was enough to annoy me.I had to replace it with an Ultra ULT40141. I'm back to peace and quiet with just a little ""whooshing"" noise that doesn't bother me at all. I hated to pay that much for a plastic fan. But, after this one, I just wanted a quiet fan and it seemed like the surest bet. The airflow is supposedly rated a little less on the Ultra, but my temps haven't changed."
2,Noisy,"While the fan is very powerful and moves a lot of air into my TT Tsunami Dream case, it is unfortunately the loudest component in my setup and easily discernible from the rest (i.e. a 1,300rpm S-Flex SFF21E as an exhaust fan, Zalman 9500A cooler, and Corsair HX650w PSU). I have the tower next to me on my desk and find the turbine-like sound slightly annoying. I strongly suspect the 28 decibel spec is incorrect or over optimistic.Had I know how noisy this fan would be, I would have bought 2 of the SFF21E model instead (which is whisper quiet)."
3,Miserable Sequel,"AFter the VOYAGE OF THE STARWOLF, I expected the crew to come back to base, get refitted and go after the bad guys. Instead, they remain stuck at Star Dock, savenging their ship to others and playing cat and mouse with a Morthan Imp.One of the premises of the book is that the humans have superior technology to the Morthan wannabes, but if one Morthan can take down a complete starship, then why do you need all these power warships. All you would need are stealthy transports to get your monsters close.I realize that any Sequel needs a certain amount of repitition to link to a previous book, but it seemed like a good quarter of the books was the same thing said slightly different.On whole an unsatisfying read."
4,Space Opera Lives!,"If you like good science fiction, then you will like this series of books. Full of imagination and consistent ""science"" throughout. Sometimes authors will concieve a world where everything about space travel is easy and immediate. This series shows that sometimes things are harder than that and seems very realistic. A very good book."
3,Couldn't remember much from the first novel,"It's been years since I read the first novel and maybe that's part of the problem. I don't really remember anything that jumps out but this novel essentially stands on its own. My biggest gripe is that I was hoping for more detailed characterization. Each chapter is really just a few pages, so its hard to get closer to the main characters. before the story jumps to another character. Don't get me wrong, I'll read the final book in the trilogy to see what happens - maybe I was expecting more from Gerrold based on reading his Chtorr series."
4,"Great Space Opera, poor editing",Completely engrossing and captivating. Wonderful story. Characters and action leap out of the book directly into your mind. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the TERRIBLE proofreading. I look forward to downloading a corrected edition.
2,Low on action,This second book of three contains about 1/3 of the story going forward and the rest is about past events. Yes it is good to have a background but why so much history? I suggest reading the first book again and passing on this one.
4,Very Heavy,"This slide is very good quality, but it's VERY heavy. Which can be good or bad depending on what you want and how you use it. I'm a pretty decent guitarist, but I'm only a beginner at playing with a slide, and this one is a bit unweildy for me."
2,Good sounding slider.,"Fit my fat fingers quite nicely, though it is a bit heavier than expected (it's brass, duh). The sound it produces is very good for the studio, but for every day play I'll stick with the small & light one for my pinkie."
5,excelent quality,excelent set of wire's i have them in my 2001 ford explorer eb 5.0 and they work good.i bought them for a better price threw amizon than local part store az or advanced for 1/3 the money with free shipping.
5,A Great Concert Experince,"I usually let the pros do the music reviews, and I stay the avid reader. But I'm compelled to review this CD since, oddly, there's only one current review for this fantastic recording. I'll just say briefly that the song selection, the vocals, the orchestra, and the engineering comprise a top notch Old School R&B listening experience. There's not a weak moment in the concert--only endless showmanship and heart. To listen is to wish you were there. This may be a classic recording that few people are familiar with, but a classic recording nonetheless."
5,a classic!,"Classic stainless, with more secure handles than previous versions, and includes two non-stick skillets - worth the money!"
3,Not so classic,"Seems to be a good product but we do have a older set and the new set is not as well made as the older set. The metal is thinner , the lids are cheaply made and the handles are just plain plastic. Time will tell if they will hold up or not. The old set needs a couple of handles replaced and I was informed by Farberware that there no longer are handles available for the old set and when I inquired about handles for the new set I was told there are not any replacement handles available. Am already disappointed as I know the handles on the new set will not hold up well."
2,Pots Are Fine; Skillets Are Crap,"The pots are fine. They clean up nicely. The skillets are another story. Cook anything with grease on these and the inside and outside simply will NOT come clean. I hang my pots exposed in the kitchen and I hide these things now because they are destroyed. They work in terms if distributing heat and what not, but got really ugly. I guess for the price they're okay... but based on the claims made in the product description, no."
1,not 18/10,"I received this set yesterday and was suprised that the bottom of the pans said ""durable stainless steel"" instead of 18/10. I called Farberware and was told that the steel is 18/0 (no nickle content) not 18/10 as the description on Amazon said. The woman said that they were going to that because of more people using induction stoves.Not sure if I will keep the product, it looked nice, except for the fact that it was not properly advertised.Added later...Called to see if I could return the product and the customer service was very helpful!! Hope the helpfulness continues."
3,Great cookware but......................................,"This cookware works great,some of the best I have had but one thing people should know is when put in a dishwasher make sure you arrange it so no water stands in the pots or they will rust, I'm talking just overnight,the very cheap cookware I had didn't even do this.I would return this set but I don't want to go to all of the trouble,I always thought Farberware was a top brand but I guess I was wrong,from now on I'm going to make sure no water stands in it.I think Farberware makes an aluminum set which I would think would be the better choice."
5,Everything we need and great quality.,"My girlfriend had been complaining for months how she needed new pots and pans. The old set just didn't measure up to the task at hand. This product is an outstanding replacement even if a bit on the heavy side. So far, after three uses I realize how superior the new pots are to the old ones. The eggs don't stick, the stew doesn't scorch and adhere to the bottom of the pot, etc. The pots even seem to grip whatever it is they are set on. I am overall very satisfied with this product and couldn't beat the price."
5,Great cooking with Farberware,"Farberware has made a name for itself for years. I love my new set. There are plenty of pots of all sizes in this set. They cook very evenly and hold in the heat. The 4 qt. pan is the perfect size for making homemade sauce and soup, while the largest 8 qt. pot is an excellent size for cooking pasta and lots of corn on the cob. I plan on using the 8 qt. for canning. My canning insert fits perfectly inside."
4,Awesome,"Loved these pots and pans. I got them on scratch and dent and some of the lids don't fit and I still love them. Look way nice.Only thing I do not like are the oven pans. They are so small and they start warping pretty quick. But, the pots and pans are spectacular."
3,Mini Airbrush w/ Compressor,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas to help our grandson with his car model building. The compressor is great and works very well. The spray head did not work well. It got clogged easily and the paint clumped. There was even a little plastic piece in the nozzle that did not belong there. After much frustration, my husband went to the local hobby shop and got a new spray nozzle which works very well with the compressor. The quality of the airbrush nozzle needs to be improved."
1,HORRIBLE,"I am so frustrated right now with this, all i want to say about it is that it is the most frustrating thing ever. It doesnt work very well, its cheap, and i just threw it ..."
3,Good for the Price,"I was looking for a low cost solution to a project I needed to paint an ""Air Brush"" style on but I did not want to pay a whole lot of money for something I may only use once or twice. It's not the best air brush in the world but it worked for what I needed."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I'd give this product NO stars if I was able to! This airbrush is garbage! It stopped working after 5 minutes of use!don't waste your money, go with a Badger or Iwata and a can of compressed air if you are intimidated by compressors!"
3,youniverse mood scapes,the best thing to calm you but not that fun. alls it does is progects a picture. it looks kool but alls you can do is stare and listen.
2,A shoe that looks better than it feels,"I've been really disappointed by these booties. The heel is too narrow and sometimes causes my ankle to roll. The width of the toes are also too narrow, and my feet aren't wide in the slightest. I don't think they're comfortable at all. Big thumbs down!"
4,Excellent introduction reference textbook!,"The content of this book is abundant and almost covers all the field of Unix, like basic operating, administration, shell script, network... etc. The paragraph can be understood easily. Beside the common command of Unix, it also introduce some thing like perl. Although it didn't recover the world of Unix deeply, it is really worth to be read by beginners who want to understand the world of Unix."
2,your unix: the ultimate guide,boodlebooks sent me the wrong edition. I ordered the 2nd edition and was sent the 1st edition which is 10 years old.
2,tHE bEST OF jOHNNY rODRIGUES,"The music is great for those who really like country music. I love Johnny Rodriguez compositions but mostly of his city music, and not the country selections"
5,Very soft work great,Well I first got the wrong size ear cushions then got the right size. They were exactly what I wanted and needed for my headset. They were exactly as described. Thanks
3,Ear Cushion for Headset,"Foam ear cushion much more comfortable than vinyl. Delivered promptly. Price was reasonable. Hard to get right fit though to match cushion to headset, so cushion tends to fall off."
2,Painfully hard!!!,"These shoes are really cute, well made, nice looking, etc, but eventhough they are not tight (they're true to size) these shoes are so hard they make your feet hurt! I got them at full price months ago and now they're really cheap, but I would not recommend them at all."
4,Very cute!,"Patent leather will be extremely fashionable this fall, and these flats are very cute, very reasonably priced and not uncomfortable in my opinion. The only slightly strange thing about them is that you can feel the edges of the insoles when you wear them, but you get used to it (that's why I didn't give 5 stars). Other than that, I'd say get them at this price while you can, you'll see plenty of - a lot more expensive - patent leather fall shoes soon!!!"
2,Warning: Blisters and Very uncomfortable,"I thought these shoes were such a good deal, nine west flats for 20 dollars, I consider that a steal. But it isnt worth it. The first day that I wore them I developed horrible blisters on my heals. The shoes are also extremely hard. These shoes are definitly not everyday shoes, I am very dissapointed. Dont waste your money its not worth the pain and discomfort."
2,Don't buy for comfort,"If you're looking for comfort, look on. I am still trying to break these babies in after 3 weeks. I even installed heal guards and they still rub terribly."
3,J.S.M!,This is a durable shoe however it takes some getting used to and the taping that you see strait around the shoe is very hard and may bruise the ankle area.
4,detox array,"Detox array it's a great product. yes, i will tell others about the product and I would order it again when I need it."
5,Great Music,"This is simply one of the best CD's EVER made. This is the CD that got me believing that there are some Christian artists who are equally talented to secular artists. I first heard this album about 2 years ago and still haven't had enough of it. The awesome vocal arrangements and great melodies make this album for everyone. My favorites are ""What If I Stumble"", ""In the Light', and ""Colored People"", but I like almost every song, which is unusual for me. This album lifts me up in praise of God, and gives me great music to listen to that doesn't pollute my mind. Thanks DC Talk."
5,I love this cd!,"But they're even better in concert! Go see them live! Finally the Christian music industry is getting musicians who don't dull the message and play creative, GOOD music! This is one of my two favorite cds, the other one being Jars of Clay. DC Talk has influenced my walk with Christ in such a powerful way. Go get this cd!"
5,It's Great!,DC Talk is one of my facourite artists and this is one of their best CDs. I think that no CD collecton is totally complete without it.
4,Well . . .,"I love dc talk I always have and I always will . This is a groundbreaking cd great songs good christian meaning . Grammy , doves , it's all good right ? almost . dc talk started out by defying what people said christian music HAD to be . They made great rap music with melodic chorus' . Their message was great . But word on the street was if dc talk wanted to make mainstream they would have to tone down the message . And they did :( But it's okay . Because we know momentum comes out ! Buy this cd because it still is great , then buy momentum and free at last one is dc talk the other toby mac . You'll love it !"
5,Jesus freak is just awesome,"this is just a really solid album all the way around. their songwriting keeps getting better and better. the album was such a breakthrough in the Christian industry, and for good reason! it's excellent. i have trouble picking out a favorite song--each one is unique, & they're all so good. some of the songs--what if i stumble, what have we become, etc.--deal with some tough topics. & the entire album just has this amazing intensity as well as a seriousness that is rarely matched by other artists. this is not a listen-to-once album; it will be in your cd player for a long time."
5,"Smashing triumph. Brilliant lyrics; rich, structured music.","dc Talk is one of the first Christian groups that can truly be called a household name. They paved the way on the pop airwaves (not to mention MTV) for other great groups such as Jars of Clay and Creed. The music has a solid foundation with excellent bass, string arrangements, and acoustic guitars, on top of which is added the distortion guitars and typical rock instruments. This gives the music a bedrock of rhythm and harmony which really knocks the listener from his/her chair, making this far and away my favorite album. It sports fantastic vocals and music that'll make your eyes water. All of which is great, but when it comes right down to it, the most important thing about this album is it's ""replayability."" Unlike most pop music these days, you can put it in your player till it grows mold, and you will never get tired of it."
4,DcTalk isn't afraid of being Jesus Freaks!,"The title song really ispired me not to be afraid to show my true self. I have been a better witness to Christ. This album has great rockin' songs with power cords, and some are slower and reflective of life. Together, they make a great mix for a wonderful album. I still like it a bit better than their latest album ""Supernatural."""
5,Awesome!!!!,"I LOVE DCTALK!!!!! they are the best christain band outthere!!1 ""jesus freak"" and ""what if i stumble"" are the best songs on the album! the coolist part is my best freind was saved at a dctalk concert in dallas!!!!!! i love jesus!!!!!"
5,this is awesommmmme!,this cd is so great it has the best music in town!!!!!!!it has playful AND preachful in a great way! and it has a poem wrote and read by k-max!! buy this c.d if you want to be pleased!
3,not 'typical' Christian Rock,"when someone mentions: ""christian rock"", expect all kinds of reactions. i bouught this exclusively for the track: ""Just Between You and Me."" then, i started listening to the rest of the disc, and liking it. all of it. a pal stopped by, noticed the cd cover, and said, ""wow, you like these guys!?"" i learned that dc talk means: ""disciples of Christ."" well, no matter what anyone thinks, i LIKE this cd, and i hope that you will also..."
5,"Gotta love these boys! Toby, Kevin & Michael...","I had been a Christian for a while, but was still learning the ropes, and when I moved here, I went to a Christian camp with a church we had just started attending. I knew there was Christian music, but from the church we had previously attended, Christian music meant hymns, which weren't bad, just not something I'd listen to for fun. dc Talk and their album *Jesus Freak* was the first Christian music that got me started into worshipping God in a whole new way! I listen to so many different kinds of music now, and they're all Christian tunes. I love this cd, get it, you'll love it... *Then stroll over to Plumb's new album 'candycoatedwaterdrops' They're also grrrreat!*"
5,My first favorite Christian album!,"I must confess that I had heard virtually no Christian rock music before I got to college... and then my roommate had one of the most rockin' collections I could've imagined! This is my personal favorite... I love ""In the Light"", but usually can't stop playing the first 3-4 tracks to hear it! Sometimes I just play the title song over and over again... it's so awesome! Who knew worship could rock like this? And ""What If I Stumble"" *so* describes how I've felt about my life for a long time... as someone said in a forward I received, your life may be the only Bible some people ever read.This is one of those CDs you *need* to have... right along with _Supernatural_ and the Newsboys' _Step Up to the Microphone_ and _Going Public_. If you can't/don't want to buy it, get a roommate who has. ;)"
5,DC TALK RULZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE DC TALK, WHO COULDN'T? THEY ROCK AND THEY WANT YOUNGER PEOPLE TO GET IN THE GROVE OF GOD AND ROCK MUSIC DOES IT. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T ALWAYS LISTEN TO ROCK OR RAP MUSIC DC TALK IS #1 ON MY LIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"A Grammy, a Billboard, a Nashville, 3 Doves & critics say...","You are missing out on the album that has broken the record of being the 5th highest selling album in the first week of release, right behind The Beatles, Garth Brookes, and Bruce Springsteen. Also it earned dc Talk's second Grammy Award! The songs has a fusion of pop/rock and goes immediately to hard/acid/alernative rock. The songs have a few tinges of rap here and there that it just wouldn't make sense to put dc Talk in one music category. The album includes snippets of off-the-wall stuff in between some of the songs, and the powerful music in the reading of the poem ""Alas My Love"" by Kevin Max Smith. ""Jesus Freak"" seems to prove that dc Talk just has their own style. Though all songs are loved, here are the most claimed to be favorites: ""Jesus Freak"", ""Color People"", ""In The Light"", ""What If I Stumble"", and Between You and Me"". END"
5,Not Your Average Christian Album,"I don't listen to Christian music. The majority of it is horrid and textbook. But I recieved this album as a gift several years ago and it's one of the best in my vast collection. Christian or not, alot of rock fans will love this one. They sound alot like Nirvana, but with Christian lyrics. And it's not sappy, corny stuff like you'd think. I know alot of people won't listen to this review and will just pass this over since it's a Christian album, but you'll really be missing out. ""Jesus Freak"" was one of the best albums to come out of the 90's. And if you decide to pick this one up and enjoy it, also check out their live album, ""Welcome to the Freak Show"". They're really great live."
5,This Christian cd Rocks!,"Well, actually this is the first christian cd i have ever bought Although i am kinda religous i was still into bands like Slipknot,Limp Bizkit,Fear factory and stuff like that...Then i thought to myself Why not buy some christian rock cd at least so i bought this album...And WOW!This cd is the best christian cd ever! It help me to put my faith stronger and that god is always there 4 ever one.sO SLOWLY...SLOWLY I AM STARTING to listen to christian music...My fav song in this album is without a doubt Jesus Freak...This album is a worth buying it and i SWEAR no one will regret buying this wonderful cd!"
5,To jason and everyone else who couldn't believe that...,"...Christian music can sound this ""Hard"". Let me sahre a little secret with ya. THIS CD ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO THE HARD ROCK + HARDCORE AVAILABLE ON THE CHRISTIAN SCENE! (as hard as it may be to believe). Go listen to some Zao, Redeem, Training For Utopia, P.O.D., etc. I guarentee you that if you like the ""hard-edge"" music on tihs CD, you'll LUV listening to these guys.Jesus Freak rox. So does the book JESUS FREAKS! Catch you all later.God loves you all."
4,How cool is Supernatrual? Listen how it all started.,"If you haven't listened to at least one song of dc Talk's then you'll be missing out on something all- everyone must of felt. It looks like a harmless CD, a crazy looking cover and a shiny silver disk and that's all you'll see until you play it. Then, and only then will you see something inside of you. You'll see how much of those songs relate to you and believe me! I was quite scared! Jesus Freak hit me quite hard and so did What have we become? So how could harmless sound waves make you scared? Those sound waves turn into soul waves for you and you only."
5,Freak Album!!! ;-),"Now that I have all of the dc Talk albums (and I didn't get them in order) It is clear that this album was definitely dc Talk breaking through the invisible barrier in Christian music that I think many were afraid to break through. And there's a surprise for you on this cd... from Kevin to you! :-)My favorite song on the album was Day by Day. dc Talk ripped it up. It was get-up-and-jump good. Jesus Freak... well... what else can I say?! That was the song that threw them into leading the Christian music industry!!! It's impossible to listen to that song and not be:A. Movin'B. Groovin'C. MovedPeriod. ;-) For this, dcT gets a 5. And, Kevin's artistic touch for the cd's booklet is just priceless. :""> He's awesome."
4,GREAT ROCK MUSIC FOR THOSE THAT DON'T LIKE ROCK MUSIC,"For any Christian who hates rock music, but is willing to give it one last chance, this is the cd you must buy! It's not heavy or radical, has polished and polite production, and flows with encouraging words and honest perspective of the Christian faith. The sound will impress the average radio listener with its blatant pop thrust. Musically, it lacks any real deep substance - but the spiritual aspects of this album are the obvious gift to the hearer. DC TALK has discovered a way to transcend the barriers between headbangers, stodgy conservatives, charismatics and casual radio listeners with this impressive mix of light to moderate rock, funk, praise & worship, rap and pop that leaves you with a spiritual alertness to the Creator and sensitivity with respect to your relationship with Him. May God be praised! - Brad Farha"
4,A Great Group......,"When DC Talk produced this CD it was probably the best CD they had or will ever produce. The songs are awesome with a message behind every one of them. The lyrics and songs just flow in a manner that is ""catchy"" and appeals to people of all ages. This group has a lot going for them, and this is a CD that has let them reach to many people worldwide."
4,"Awesome, but slightly disapointing","I owned Supernatural and Free At Last before aquiring Jesus Freak, and sadly I thought it slightly a dissapointment with some really great songs and some songs just on the album as an afterthought. I didn't make for a wonderful listening experience just a great one. Still the song Jesus Freak is totally AWESOME..along with So help me God, Mind's Eye, etc....keep rocking dctalk!"
5,**Positively awesome!**,"You want a Christian rock band whose lyrics you can actually hear? You want a Christian rock band that, while delivering a solid Christ-centered message, keeps you goin' with awesome upbeat, powered up songs? Look no further than DC Talk and their album Jesus Freak!From the very first song, you're gonna love this band and there awesome view of God and how we should stand up for him! This is one CD that no Christian rock band fan should miss!!"
2,Little guy,"Tough to sharpen this guy, one of the scales fell off for no apparent reason. I did not abuse the thing, only used it to open boxes and other light household chores.Now it is being used as a letter opener."
1,another great ska band goes punk,"i don't know why all ska bands changes from ska to punk pop(for example subb, goldfinger, buck on ine) punk... i love the first record, and the second: solid state 14 and skateboard music. this album [is bad],punk is boring: no guitar catchy riffs, no fast and complex bass lines and no great lyrics as in the first album."
2,hope you don't have diarrhea,"because you won't want to miss a single second of this classic poo poo mouthed anime. with the rhetorical question ""How do you know I won't kill you with this?"" we are whisked away to magical place, where the only way to get your robot to do what you want is to curse at him excessively, and computer experts are foul mouthed 'roid addicts. And between wondering why the slender looking, silver haired hottie in the beginning turns about to be a male vampire, and wondering if we missed something between the girl on the elevator and sengoku as they seem to have met before we got a chance to see it, we also get a chance to ponder the practicality of a building that's so tall it reaches into space. How do I spell classy anime? With a capital C of course. C for Cyber City. The animation's good.By the way, Say hello to jesus for me."
1,beware,Buyers beware this is not the study guide for the current text book it is for an older version. Don't make the same mistake I did.
4,Is it really Cool?,"Well, I've used my CoolDaddy for the first time and the food turned out great! Fry time was great. The basket worked like it was supposed to. It had easy cleanup. However, I've read the other reviews and nobody mentions that the CoolDaddy is not Cool at all. I accidentally touched the outside housing while frying my food and burned my fingers! Now, while there are no blisters to be had, my fingers were sore for a minute or so after I touched it. So buyer beware, if you are looking for a real ""cool touch"" deep fryer just as this Presto COOLDaddy boasts, you will be disappointed. I must say though, that it is cooler than the regular non cool touch deep fryers. So other than that, everything is great!"
4,Trotter and Alain a Great Combo!,"I'm writing this review primarily to give some sense about the CD since there's no information here on the Amazon listing. Trotter is, as usual, virtuosic, and the Alain works are provocative and amazing. Included are the Trois Danses, the Fantasmagorie, the Premier Fantaisie, the Deuxieume Fantaisie Suite in three movements, the Deux Danses a Agni Yavishta, and finally, the Trois Pieces which concludes with the much-loved, much-played and much-recorded Litanies! Tom's rendering of Litanies is worth the price of admission on its own, but it's great fun to have some of these other less familiar pieces.I've given this 4 stars mostly because, as is so often the case with organ CD's, the recording itself cannot quite match the demands of the instrument."
5,excellent!,"This was a replacement for the one my husband lost during our move. He loves it. The product was at an excellent price, and the storage case was awesome."
3,Good - but,"This is a good book which is written like an exercise manual. It is complete. The purpose of it is to have an OBE. Well, I'm still working on it. Anyway, I also read his "" Astral Dynamics "" and can say that you don't need both books. They cover about the same stuff. I would pick the Astral Dynamics book."
5,Best book I have ever read on how to safely enter a greater reality,"I was on an active spiritual journey for 25 years. Over that time I've done, seen, and read many things. I've travelled the world for knowledge and spent thousands of dollars in the pursuit of truth.This book is the best single key I have ever found in all those years. If you apply yourself for 1 hour a day for 3 months you are practically guaranteed to have repeatable spiritual experiences. This book also provides a down to earth framework to understand your new experiences, which is vital.If you want to know, not just believe, that your consciousness operates quite happily independent of your body, then this book will prove that fact to you. Then you will know, and your fear of death will be gone, as well as your reliance on any dogmas.Also as a bonus, you are likely to enjoy many side benefits while you explore the larger multidimensional aspects of your nature.Enjoy!"
3,problems with CD included,The book came in great condition and came fast even with supersaver shipping. I am please with the service and the book but the CD included with the book only allowed me to use part of the files and didn't work on pc or mac.
4,Excellent How To On Projection,Ignore the 3 bad reviews below. They 're all by the same fella whose trying to peddle his own cheesey selfpublished OBE book on lulu.com.Me and my boyfriend used this book to OOBE's on several occassions. We liked that it takes you through it in small steps. It only took me a few weeks before I was remembering my OOBE's. Took my boyfriend longer. Learning to OOBE takes time. Dont let anyone tell you different.
2,Not an astral projection book.,"I think it is about the time, someone should find out this is a meditation book, but not an astral projection book. This book is clearly misleading.As you read along, you will find nothing about projecting the astral, but distant viewing of incidents."
2,"A little better than Astral Dynamics, but...","Author is from Australia, they have different ways of day and night compare to the America, this could explain why Author has tendency of dragging the pages and making it extra long, but basically same words kept repeating. Very tiring read."
4,Gangster gone wild,"Just to think that my parents lived through this ""Crime Wave"" when they were younger. Not much difference of what is going on today! This really was quite a defining period of our American history. They actually made these killers ""special celebrities"" at the time. Guess it was the mood of the country. They put them up on pedestals. These killers have been romanticzied in movies and when they ""get theirs"" in the end - and they always do - we feel sorry for them. Poor, misundersood little darlings who wouldn't think twice about mowing down your mother or father if they got in the way! A sign of the times. Good video for history buffs and for those who want to reminisce about the 1930's and the great depression - educational. Fast paced, like the old newsreels they would show at the theatres. Well worth the money."
1,not happy with this mold,the mold came on time but was damaged it was cracked and warped i am not happy with this mold
5,Very Sexy!!,"I first read this book my junior year in high school in 1982. I found it very educational (as a budding young woman). It's a love story with alot of zest. It's one of the things I will always remember from my teen years, my friends and I all read it and it was always quite the conversational piece! Kudos to Ms. Durand! I'd love to read a sequel about Solange's adventures in love!"
5,Best bargain I ever found!,"I picked up this book at a garage sale in the 80's. I consider it the best bargain I ever found! This book is truly timeless. From the very first page to the last, Solange takes you on a journey that you don't want to end. This book moves very smooth and snappy. Read it once, and it's bound to become a well-read favorite!"
5,"Sensual, Heartwarming and Funny!","I have read this book several times. I know its an older book, but the emotion and feeling of the character Solange is classic and timeless. You will love this book with its sexy humor, and never forgotten human emotions!"
5,Mandarin Orange Sunday,"Where do I begin? I bought this book at a Shop Rite in CT when I was 17 in the early 80's. I was hooked from the beginning...I loved everything about Solange and her life. As a budding sexual being, I learned alot from Solange! I let a friend borrow this book and never saw it again until the internet....and I finally found a copy in 2000 and re-lived Solange's life again as an adult. I still loved it and will not ever let this book get away from me again."
2,Long Winded Narrative- Light on Substance,"Better than nothing. It lacks concise useful information for finding paddling put ins, take outs and obstacles. She is a little long winded on her anecdotes."
5,Paddler's Guide to the Sunshine State,"This is a very good, extensive guide to the many wonderful areas of Florida to canoe. Come see Florida like it used to be!!"
4,Valuable quick guide for job search,"Quick read, easy book, good advice. The best part the the book are the list of words that can help you describe yourself. I also liked the ""Get the best deal"" chapter that lists all the fringe benefits one can and should ask for when relocating or making sure that proper severance package is in place..."
5,"It's not your answers, but your questions","This book does a great job of helping you ask the questions that will get you a job. As a training manager, who trains managers and executives on how to interview, I feel I am qualified to say this book works.I know we look for people who can ask the right question. This book is a wonderful resource once you get the interview. This leaves us with the question, ""How do you get an interview?"" Simple, know the type of job you want and pursue it, if you do not know what type of job you want you may want to read the classic, ""How to find your dream job and make it a reality."" By Jason McClure.Read this book, and learn how to ask questions for your job interview."
5,101 Questions to ask is good!,This book walks you through the interview process and things to ask when get into the interview. The tips and questions reflect a common sense approach to preparing. It helped me. I was able to ask a number of questions that answered things I really wanted to know and may not have thought to ask without having reviewed this book.
1,What they don't tell you...,"I was really hoping to open the box, plug in my guitar, and get started making Frampton and Daft Punk sounds. I was not so lucky. What the description doesn't tell you is that in order for this talkbox to work at all, you need a speaker head and cabinet, as the HT-1 lacks a built-in pre-amp. This, understandably, ruined my day. I assumed at most I would need an instrument and maybe a small amp. There are other talkboxes out there, like the Rocktron Banshee, that has a built in pre-amp, meaning all you need to use it is an instrument and speaker cable. I now have an HT-1 that I can't use and, because of whatever reason (the distributor won't respond to my refund request), can't refund... A great waste of no small amount of change. Don't go for this one unless you have all the other gear it'll require to use."
1,what?,"No instructions or reasoning came with this product. Made no claims what-so-ever on the package that it would help a drinker stop drinking. hmmm,"
3,The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,"I think The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates was an okay book. Joshua, the main character, was very humorous. Joshua just ended the summer after a year of third grade. He is shocked and embarassed when he learns he has to repeat third grade over. Josh wasn't happy about the situation at first, but then Mrs. Goodwin came in. Mrs. Goodwin tutored Josh after school and during school she made him feel beeter about himself. Josh takes the test to fourth grade. Did he make it or did he not? Read The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates to find out the ending and all the hysterical details."
3,Joshua T. bates,I gave this book a three because the book had a a short story line and did not give enough charcter detail in my opinion. Basically this book is aboutJosh a third grade student who has to repeat third grade and is very miserable. Until his teacher starts helping him. The book was pretty amusing but I couldn't keep reading on and on. I would say that overall this was a fair book.
5,The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,"I think The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates was really humorous. Joshua was having a really great summer until his mom told him he had to repeat third grade.Then he finds out that his third grade teacher is Mrs.Goodwin. Joshua is such a worrier because he worries about his report card but that's not all - Tommy Wilhelm, the the class room bully, gets to go into fourth grade and Joshua is so mad that he says that he is going to East Africa.Read to find what happens to Joshua."
4,Joshua T. Bates,"The main characters are Josh, Mrs.Goodwin(the tank), Andrew, and his family. It starts out with having a great summer. Until his mom gives him the bad news. He flunked third grade. On the first day he walked with his mom and dad angry and embarresed. To find out what happens you'll have to read the book."
3,My thoughts on The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,I really liked this book. It was pretty funny. It was very easy for me to get in to it. I finished it in two days of reading. Thats how much I liked it. I would like to read more books by Susan Shreve. I think she might be writer I would enjoy. Overall I think this book was great!
3,Kaleh's Corner,"Joshua has to repeat the third grade, in Mrs. Goodwin's class. His teacher says he needs another year to mature. Everyone teases him, especially Tommy Wintey. They say he's a baby. He is sick of it. The first day of third grade was horrible. Everyone stared at him like he was stupid. Joshua's best friend is in fourth grade. Tommy Wintey makes a rule. The rule is no fourth grader can be friends with a third grader. Will Joshua ever catch up, or will he be in the third grade forever? His teacher says she will give him extra help after school. After a few weeks of extra help, he takes a test to see if he can go to fourth grade. I recommend this book to kids in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, because it is about kids at this age who are really funny."
4,The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,"I rated this book four(4) out of five(5) stars, because I thought it was a pretty good book. It should not have ended the way it did though. Most of the story is in the title - Joshua flunks 3rd grade. His teacher thought it was unfair, so she starts tutoring him, and later he takes a test to see if he can go to 4th grade. Will he make it to 4th grade? Find out by reading the book!"
3,The Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,I thought this book was just okay. I thought this because I didn't think it was that suspenseful. This book was about a boy who had to repeat third grade. At first he is upset. But with help from his teacher that all turns around. A third or fourth grader may enjoy this more.
3,The Flunking Of Joshua T. Bates,"I would recommend this book only for younger children. Personally, I have read many with the same plot. Joshua T. Bates is having a wonderful summer when his mother tells him that he has to repeat third grade. ""Things just keep getting worse when he finds out he has Mrs. Goodwin ""the tank."" I think that some people may really enjoy this book. Read about Josh's adventures and see how you like it."
3,a book hard to find,"I am a student of BE computers and have been looking for this book all this sem,finally I came up with the idea to try amazon ,and there it was though its out of print ,I can review it on line and even download the reqd. chapters,isnt that convienient for a student like me,now on I,ll check amazon before any local book store,I can even review so many books before choosing what to buy! its grate"
1,One mother's opinion,"My teenager and I just finished reading this book as a summer reading requirement for school. We both agreed that it was one of the worst books we had ever read. The conversations were silly, the word ""dude"" was said at least 3 dozen times (who says ""dude"" anymore anyway?) and the situations were melodramatic to say the least. We both agree there are much better options out there for high school students and our hope is that the English teacher who chose this for class won't require any more from this author."
1,Celebrating Horrible Mistakes,"Once again, Draper tries to appeal to the most basal thinker. SHe blunders through telling about a young lady who is suffering after a boy friend's suicide and then celebrates the inappropriate relationship that the pedaphile track coach creates with her.We have young women making the assumption that an older guy is more mature but what they forget is that his lack of maturity is why he cannot date women his age, he has to go for wounded and weak younger girls. The problem is that the way this book celebrates the situation makes it seem okay.The chapter in which he tries to rape her is rough. She gets away too easily. This is not how the situation goes down in the real world. The author needs to worry less about making it seem okay and candy coating the issue - this is REAL and by writing it with a simple solution, it normalizes the issue and paints a false picture of a horrible reality. I hope that no one will read this without discussing reality."
4,fantastic,"this was a fantastic book written by sharon draper. that tells about keisha's life, and what she does."
4,Great product but...,The product was recived with a dead battery. Had to take it to a repair shop to replace battery since the back could not easily be opened.
3,Decent Product for the price,"I did enjoy the retro syling of the case, and the good heavy feeling of the dominoes. There were several scratches on the dominoes, as well as carbon contamination baked into the plastic that I found dissapointing.But overall for the price it was a fine deal. I mean, how fancy DO you need a dominoe set?The dominoes are fairly sturdy, my drunk friends have a habit of slamming the bones downs. No breaks yet!"
2,Good Customer Service OK Quality,"The first order was lost, similar to another post. When I received the 2nd order, it had 2 sets, one with a cracked case. Since I had a set just like this when I was younger, I was looking forward to replacing it. Unfortunately, the case is made out of plastic which is hard to know based on the photo or description. I would not have ordered this if I had known it was plastic."
3,not as thick as i wanted,do to the fact im getting old and my hands shake i was hopping they would be thick so they wouldnt fall over when i play but there not thick enough.
3,"Nice set of Dominoes but not worth $30, not even $16",The dominoes are nice. but are they really worth $30 or $16. Purchased because I had a gift certificate. Some of the black dots are not well painted and a dominoe had a chip on the outer side.
3,"Mostly authentic, but humbug to build","This model attempts a lot, but doesn't always succeed. The ships were so-so. There were small difficulties with getting things to match the groundplate or each other. When many buildings are strung together, or a city wall has many segments and towers, a trifle here and there adds up to a potentially large gap somewhere. Triple-check everything!"
3,Natural Factors BlueRich Super Strength Blueberry Concentrate,Natural Factors BlueRich Super Strength Blueberry Concentrate have not see any change after using this for 30 Days will see how it goes
5,Trapped in the Ashes,The Ashes series has 33 books so far and all are wonderful. Infact you not only will get hooked but waiting for the next is hard. Ben Rains is a super star trying to put the world right after postwar anarchy. His adventures go from the USA to Europe and beyond. He gets in trouble where ever he goes and you feel like you are right beside him. All Americans need to read this series and clean up America. His problem solving would work today. Trapped in the Ashes is set in New York City where mutant cannibals (night people) have taken over and he needs to clean them out and save the few normal people who are hiding within. Great clean adventure.
3,Good noise,"Their first single, Hey Gravity, a one-off for the Radiate label, made it to number 6 in the 2002 Festive Fifty, and its follow up, Live A Little, reached 35 in the same chart of listener's votes the following year. Both songs from this useful twin-guitar indie five-piece from Camden Town occur on this debut album, although Hey Gravity does not benefit for having been re-recorded for their new label, Tréma (and has a guitar segue from the previous track). Live A Little, formerly on both Mandita and Purr labels, seems to be the same version as here, as is their third single, Testify, which makes a powerful opening track. MASS seem to be an uncomplicated (in a good way) guitar band, led by their founder and singer Justine, and the album replicates their live sound with clarity and volume"
5,A Classic,"Love Kevin Costner, love Whitney and their chemistry in this movie plus their stellar acting made this a classic in our home."
3,CholesTrak Home Chosesterol Test,"The results of the CholesTrak and the results from the hospital, taken within the same hour, do not match. I've done the Cholestrak 4 times - twice within the time frame of the hospital. There was a 60 point differential on total cholesterol, with CholesTrak being the lower number.Although it is not accurate, the Cholestrak does give an indication of whether I'm going in the right direction with my food choices and exercise. When my cholesterol was 320 from the hospital, Cholestrak registered about 250. When I reduced my cholesterol to 245 per the hospital, Cholestrak registered 187."
1,It did not work!!,"This thing did not work at all. I have done it twice. The first time, color did not changed at all; the second time, the first indicator (the OK indicator) changed the color, but it never reach end indicator. So after pricking finger twice, there is no reading of cholesterol at all, not even an inaccurate one."
1,ripped off,The directions are too difficlt to follow.You have to practice a number of times to get it right. It's too messy. I doubt if the results are correct.I wouldn't buy it again. Don't recommend it. Waste of money
1,was not accurate at all,"followed instructions exactly and then two days later went to doctor who drew blood and sent to lab, this kit showed results not even close. would never buy again. total waste of time and money and dangerous in my opinon."
5,"No batteries, all fun","My 5 year old son got this for his birthday and has played with it every day for two weeks. The blade is segmented and stows in the handle or can be swished out by sliding an unlock button and making a Jedi Knight-like gesture. This is a simple, no-frills toy and my boy loves it. It also has a belt clip. I need one too so we can battle."
1,Lightsaber,"Okay, the first thing I am going to say is this toy is a big plastic stick. The toy does not light up, make sounds, and is way too short. Grown-ups like me can't fight together you know what I mean right? The toy is very durable but, like I said, it is way too short and does'nt do anything cool. For 13 dollars more you can get a LIGHT -UP LIGHTsaber that grown-ups and kids can play with! So parents out there buying toys, I rest my case.P.S... Don't forget to judge this review!!!"
3,They weren't hits for a reason...,"Great series of CD's let down by poor pachaging & quality of the recordings...& the mistakes. Sure there's no info on the songs or artists or the year the song was recorded/released & they look like bootleg CD's (they aren't) but that aside...overall the CD is fun & enlightening.Mistakes: ""Valerie"" by the Pineapple Heard (what a great dumb name for a band) is NOT the original. The Monkees did it for the TV show, then re-recorded the song for release as a 45...Herd's version is based on the TV recording complete with fuzz guitar but the Monkees veriosn IS the original. ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" (Tk 22) was originaly recorded by riginal. That was recorded in 1933 by Gertrude Niesen not Richard Barrett. Remember, the song was in the 1932 musical ROBERTA.Overall the series is still a great buy, especialy for collectors or anyone who works at an Oldies radio station. If you are interested,check out You Heard It Here First Vol 1 & 2."
2,The New YorK Times Large-Print Easy Crossword Omnibus Vol. 1,Not easy. I bought it for my 92 yr. old mother. The clues were not appropriate for the answers.
1,A Huge Disappointment!!,"If you buy Playboy for the articles, then this is perfect for you. 99% of the video is Farrah talking about her life while we see pictures of her childhood, magazine covers and her giggling. If you thought you were buying a video equal to the spread in Playboy, think again, because this was a huge disappointment. You will be teased with a rare and fleeting glimpse of this beautiful ""actress"",but not long enough to justify the price. Shame on you, Playboy!"
1,Fallen Farrah,"This was really just sad. I'm one of those people who thought Farrah had talent. This video shows the depths that some people will go to for money. There was nothing erotic, sexy, or uplifting about this video. When Farrah talks, it is obvious that she knows what a joke this video will be, but she took the money and ran. She's much sexier in anything other than this video. As for its artistic merits, how great an artist can she be while rolling around a canvas covered in paint. It probably wouldn't have been as bad if she hadn't been taking herself quite so seriously."
2,What a reboiled soup!!,"It's neither a celebration nor a sexy video, you can only be bored by interviews with art directors and other people happy to tell how much fantastic and particular is Farrah, tiny cuts from films and imagines from magazines...OK, What's new ?How could I find sexy or exitant see an unrecognizable Farraw semi-naked but all painted...please don't.In this video there is nothing that every fan of Farrah hasn't already seen , so far it should be better a vulgar strip tease so at least we'd seen a beautiful naked lady.Keep this advice: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
4,1/2 horror 1/2 not,"I got Mirror, Mirror yesterday from amazon.com. It was a used book. The second I started reading it, I knew it was a winner. The book is about a very vain girl named Dore. Miss Beauty Queen. But winning Little Miss somethig or rather isn't good enough for Dore. She wants to be more beautiful. Then she meets Luci. The minute she meets her, she gets her wish. She getts all the cute guys and is more beautiful. But, to be happy, she hurts , embarreses or even kills anyone who gets in her way. I didn't get the ending though. I think she went mad. Also, the killer never got caught (the killer isn't Dore)! The book was good, but not alot of ""horror"" events happened. A deffinent 4!!!"
5,Excellent Read,"This book really hits all the right areas that you feel during a breakup. As he said he has been there too. Therefore you can tell that his advice is coming from the heart. I am not a religous person, but this book allows you to explore what beliefs you have and feel the comfort that you are not alone in this battle. Try this book, its inexpensive so you dont have much to lose. The advice is down to earth and put in terms you can relate to. The very exact thoughts that went through my head are described in the book and how you can manage those thoughts. Good luck to all of you. I hope this will help."
5,A Great Book for someone who has or is suffering from a loss,I have read this book and find it very helpful in dealing with my own recent separation from a wife of 31 years. His advice is very good and will cause one to think and better still to think positively. I'm going to buy a couple more copies to give to a friend and to my pastor to use / recommend in his counseling efforts
5,"""Raising Lazarus""","Being an HCM victim myself, I found this book highly informative, educational, moving, emotional, and inspiring. I could relate to his suffering, his motivation, and his tenacity. It's a miracle that he survived to share his experiences. This book gave me the determination to educate myself, and motivate myself to live with and survive this condition, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. A great read for everyone; highly recommend!"
1,RIP OFFS ON OLD BOOKS,"ALL OF THESE BOOKS OF NORA ROBERT'S UNLESS IT SAYS ON THE FRONT--ARE OLD WHEN SHE WAS NOT AS PROLIFIC AS SHE IS TODAY. AS FAR AS THE STORIES GO, THEY ARE FINE, BUT I ORDERED 4---YES I SAID 4--IT HAD BEEN SO LONG SINCE I HAD READ THEM, FORGOT I ALREADY HAD; THEY--PUBLISHERS PUT NEW COVERS ON AND THIS IS A SORE POINT WITH ME--THEN I BUY THEM. I WILL NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN, I WILL NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON IN THE BOOK CATEGORY UNLESS I KNOW IT IS NEW. REGARDS,DH"
1,Not worth the trouble,"I am a fan of Nora Roberts. This was some old short story, reprinted as a stand alone book. Not worth the time or money. I feel the publishers mis-represented this. Story was fine - for the 30 seconds it took to read."
1,Not Pleased,"I read half the book and put it down, I am still trying to make myself read the rest. It is the sappiest, worst story I have ever read. The characters are not well devloped and the story basically focuses on lust for sex and corny lines. I love Nora Roberts, but this book is poorly written and very misleading, and it's only 81 pages long. If you want to read a good Nora Roberts book having to do with love and magic, read the Three Sisters Island Trilogy; or if you just want a good story, read Public Secrets."
2,"I like Nora, but this book is not her best. I would pass","This book is very short and not Nora Roberts best book. I would save your money and buy one of her other books. Basically this is some weird witch, sorcery, past-lives spin in this book and it is not well done. I did not really feel connected to the characters and was not engaged in the story. And the ending is pretty stupid.I would recommend ""The Search"" by Nora Roberts much better than this book!"
3,Nah,"I searched for ever in all book stores and other shops. When I finally find it, I am a little disappointed."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"I am a fan of Nora Roberts, but this book was hard to take and the worst book of hers I ever read"
2,Spellbound,Love all things Nora Roberts but felt like I got stung on this one. Only approx 85 pages for $2.99. Not worth it!
2,spellbound,"If I had known the book was only about 150 pages long, I wouldn't have wasted the money, especially on the shipping and handling."
2,Throwaway NR,"When I purchased this book I realized it would be a paperback. I thought it was a really great bargain. I did not realize that it would be so small, the print so small that it was like purchasing a paperback that I wouldn't mind throwing away. It was very cheap quality. I would have rather paid a little more and purchased a better quality paperback."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,Nora Roberts is a great author. Draws you right into novel. Love all the books by here I've read.
3,A little short,"Did not realize this was a short story, do not pay more than 2.99 for it. It's a good book, but much shorter than I expected."
5,Amazing,"This short story was so interesting, was not a bit disappointed. I can't wait to read more Nora Roberts. If you liked this you might also like Love Returns Through The Portal of Time!!! Two thumbs up!!! WOuld recommend this book to anyone out there that likes to read!!"
1,Not Roberts's best,"Spellbound was a big disappointment. I have read every Nora Roberts book, and this wasn't worth the small price. The book isn't up to her normal high-entertaining standards. I couldn't even finish it. What happened and what was she thinking?"
5,Great short story,"The most important part of the above review title is 'short'. This is a short story, not a novel. Its a great short story that I realy enjoyed, and kept on my shelf to read again some day.But because it is so short, paying the price of the shipping to buy online is more than the cost to buy it in a store. So check your stores if you want to read it. I found a copy, a few weeks after I looked at it online, at a book sale at a local library, for 50cents...lucky me as I thought about paying the 2.99 to buy at the store."
2,details,I did not know it at the time (& Amazon nor seller told me) but this is a little bitty book. I am talking maybe 60 pages if that. I read (I say read anyway) this several years ago in a compilation book with 3 other authors. It's not 1 of Nora Robert's best. In fact it may be her worst in my opinion. My advice? Order another Nora Roberts book unless you just want to make your Roberts library complete!
1,spelbound,A short story that has no caracter developement at all being sold as a book - I am disappointed in Nora Roberts or who she trust as a publisher!
3,Tiny Book,This was a very desceptive purchase off of Amazon. It's a book you can finish in an hour it's that small. Not your usual Nora full length novel.
3,Spellbound Review,"The book is a good read. I just wish it had been longer, with more interaction with the characters. It went too fast for me."
5,..,It was a really good short story it left me wanting more and feeling like the story needed more sustenance
1,Don't bother...,"I cannot believe that they would even sell this ""short story"" bound! It's not a book; it's a few pages. I have never been so disappointed by anything I have ever ordered from amazon.com!"
2,Too little for the price,This was more a short-story pamphlet than a book. The story was okay for what it was but I paid $2.99 for something that was delivered in an envelope and here's the really ridiculous part--the shipping was $3.99. $7.00 for a pamphlet!! I could have had a hard-backed book from Barnes & Nobles for that price!
2,Nora is writing too many maybe????,"nora I love your stories and how I can immediately become a part of the story....but lately your novels are getting thinner and thinner I will gladly wait for you to write a thick long story such as ""the search"" like the old days of your writings.... Are they working you too hard to mass produce maybe?????"
3,Just a short story,I was very surprised when I received this and found it not to be a novel but more of a short story
3,Too short to tell,"This is a sweet, short love story, a thousand years old. A true Nora Roberts tale of Ireland, witches, and history. I enjoyed the tale, but found it to be very ""thin"". The story could well have been one great novel instead of 94 pages."
2,Should have stayed in the compilation,"I don't think this story was strong enoughto stand alone. It's typical Roberts fare - witchy woman, unbelieving man, Destiny, and totally bad dude.It was done Much better in the three sisters trilogy. And those lasted longer than a sneeze.(*)>"
2,Good book if you have 30 minutes to spare,"This is a very small book, less than 90 pages, and it took about half an hour to read. I have to say I was confused when I got it and thought I might have ordered it in error but it really is less than 1/4"" thick and doesn't really seem to be a ""book"". I was disappointed when I was looking forward to curling up for a long evening with a good story and I read it during the evening news."
2,Not up to previous standards,"I usually enjoy Nora Roberts romances with a little magic added,but this book did not have the depth of her usual stories."
1,Did NOT receive it.,"I received my Kindle as a gift and I have ordered other books but have never received them on my Kindle. Sorry, as the two I did receive I was very excited and wanted more. I get confirmation so far have not received the books."
4,A nice romantic read,"Nora Roberts continues to weave her magic in this short, but delightful tale of undying love, evil, and witch craft"
2,Not my favorite,A little cheesy. Roberts is one of my favorite authors but I just can't recommend this one. Not sure why I finished it.
3,Spellbound,"Altho Nora Roberts always writes a good story, I was disappointed in the brevity of this one. Really not worth purchasing if you are looking for the average type of Nora Roberts. I have learned to watch the more popular authors, as they tend to either give novellas or a conglomeration of short stories that personally I do not find worth my time. If you have already purchased this one. Enjoy the read, it will be painfully short."
3,A sweet but over to quick romance,"I love romance and I love Roberts, I'm a sucker for the happily ever after endings...but I need a bit of time to get to know the characters and this book was not really long enough to do that. I want to be vested in their lives so I'm really looking forward to them getting together. Definitely longer would have been better."
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"I absolutely LOVE Nora Roberts and have never read a book of hers that was not wonderful. This book is good, it is just not nearly as good as all her other books that I have read."
2,Slow -,"Sorry to say, an all to familiar line - too long to get to the point - as with some of her latest pieces wriiten. I would not feel proud to recommend this book"
3,books,"great condition, the book itself is not one of Noras best, but it is worth the read, even if it is just to find out what is going on."
3,Spellbound,"This is the first book I have read of Nora Roberts that has touched on fantasy, modern-day mishaps and ancient curses, a good short story that has the imagination running wild"
5,Spellbound,This author never ceases to fail holding the attention of her audience. This book is well worth adding to your collection.
4,good read,"I like Nora Robert's work. Her style brings out a certain reality; which is a good thing because her subject matter is often from the fantasy world. This particular book (or story)was impossible to put down. It was mysterious, scary, and wonderfully emotional. Great ending, too. I never pass up her work, no matter what name she writes under."
3,Spellbound,Spellbound was a fun read if you like fantasy. Nora Roberts often uses fantasy but I enjoy her longer books where she has more time for character development. She often uses humor and the banter between her characters is always fun.
1,rip off,"this book was only 80 pages long, but it is also in a book she wrote w/ other authors. so I had already read it.Had I known it was in her once upon a time series I would not have wasted my money, It would cost even more to send back!!"
5,Spellbound,"This is a wonderful romance, as well as as a great story of the most powerful magic of all, love. It all happens rather fast, but, I think that just makes it more sweet. A great tale with love and danger. Another winner."
1,READERS,"TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I READ ALL NORA ROBERTS BOOKS. SPELLBOUND IS NOT ONLY THE SHORTEST BOOK (I READ IT IN UNDER AN HOUR) OF HERS THAT I HAVE EVER READ, IT ALSO WASN'T TYPICAL OF HER USUAL WONDERFUL WRITING. I ESPECIALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE THEME OF THE STORY."
5,Short & Sweet,I thoroughly enjoyed the book Spellbound. It was short the shortest book but as usual Nora pulled it together in a most entertaining manner. Since reading this book I have discovered the hero in yet another of her novels.I plan to read as soon as I can order it. I recommend ... a nice short read.
3,Spellbound,For Nora Roberts I found this book to be somewhat on the dull side. I am usely a big Nora Roberts fan.
3,Enjoyable but weak plot,"Short story, nice, a little odd. Enjoyable ending. I would have preferred if Bryna had told Cal everything instead of keeping some information secret. Creating suspense due to keeping information from your loved one is not my favorite kind of plot.Sexual content: mild. Setting: current day New York and Ireland. Copyright: 1998. Genre: fantasy romance.For a listing of my reviews of other Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb books, see my 4 star review of ""Angels Fall"" posted on 6/30/08."
4,pretty good,"it came on time in good condition the story line was ok i read alot of alien books and what makes them not as great as preadtor books, the aliens are 2d figures there's no detail, no view point of the alien, no 1st person shooter pov in these books i think if they did that the books would be FANTASTIC!"
3,"not a good way to start the series, but ok","i started reading this book with higth expectations, only to be let down. the book drags on and on, and all these characters wich have practicaly nothing to do with the story keep get added to the mix. was it worth the wait for the end? well, kind of. i thought it was smart that it conected to the first alien movie and the sudden rush of energy. one major problem with the book is the large amount of sexual content within its pages. i rate the movie M15+(coarse language, some violence and sex scenes)that is australian movie ratings."
2,What happened hear?,"Wow, this book was pretty boring until the end. The book had way too many charicters to keep up with. It could have been better if Perry limited the amount of charicters in the book and get more action instead of the begining and the end. I have only read two Alien books but so far I would suggest Aliens: Berserker if you like lots of action."
2,Not the best aliens book I read,"This book is boring ,too many characters,and a waste of time.Dont get it"
1,Excruciatingly boring book,"I saw a mention of this book in blogspace a few months ago. Though I am an enthusiastic reader on public health and development (I used to be in Peace Corps in Africa), this was the most boring read I have had the misfortune to encounter. Couldn't make it all the way through and was sorry I wasted the money. He focuses on really minor stuff, like a string of emails between people who aren't important and who don't have much to say."
5,Wonderful Series,"I picked up a copy of Tiger Eye on impulse. Since then I have been a fan of Marjorie M. Liu. She has a real talent for hooking a reader until the last page.In this entry into the Dirk & Steele Detective Agency, Dean Campbell finds his lost love, Mira. They thought each other dead, only to meet again after 20 years. Both have power that was unknown until now. Dean knew of his psychometric ability, but now it is changing into something more. Mira was unaware of her ability. This book has all of the magic of it's forefunners and adds more knowledge to this particular world. Some of the characters from other books are back. Particularly Koni, he who flys as crow. There is more knowledge about the dragons - who get more complicated.I recommend that the books be read in order. There is information in each contributing to the next. It is possible to read them as stand alone though.This series is really wonderful. My only complaint is that Liu is writing too slowly."
3,Not up to my expectations,"I found the previous efforts by this author very promising.This book was boring and easy to put down. Her recent short story with Feehan in Dark Dreamers was also hard to finish. I might try again, but will buy used."
2,Carol Says,I could not generate a great deal of enthusiasm for this book. The 'Red Heart of Jade' became a chore for me to finish. I became interested in Margaret Liu's novels when I read the Crimson City series. This is not one of her better efforts.
3,The Red Heart of Jade: Dirk & Steele,"I have read other work by Marjorie M. Liu that I liked much better. This one kept moving back and forth from past to present, and kept me confused. I was constantly trying to figure out who was speaking, and when they were speaking."
4,This series gets better and better,"Each one of Ms. Liu's Dirk and Steele books is better than the last. She writes lyrically at times, gritty at other times, and the depth of her characters is equal to her fertile imagination. By this book, the third in her series, she's also got her pacing down cold, too, telling a really engaging action-adventure-paranormal romance. Dean Campbell of the Dirk and Steele (paranormal) detective agency, is in China tracking a murderer who burns his victims alive. There he meets up with his long-lost love, archeologist Mirabelle Lee. They have believed each other dead for the last twenty years, each thinking the other killed in a shooting when they were sixteen. Their reunion forces them to not only solve the mystery of the killer...but to save the world--of course. Much fun.I'm also a fan of her Hunter Kiss novels, of which I am currently reading book #2 (although the series actually starts with the story, ""Hunter Kiss,"" from the anthology, Wild Thing)."
3,Photo was just what we ordered,"Color was vibrant and image was clear. However, the glass was completely shattered upon delivery. Had to reframe at the last minute."
5,Mother's Day Murder is a tightly plotted mystery....,"Lee Harris has given her former nun, turned suburban housewife, an especially difficult puzzle. And one that has the fate of her dear friend and mentor, Sister Joseph, squarely in her hands. A young woman knocks on Christine's door one night with a story to tell that could ruin the reputation and the very life of Joseph. She begs for help from Christine, but within 48 hours, she is found dead. And Sister Joseph looks like the most likely suspect to the police. Christine must get the true facts FAST in order to keep her friend from being arrested for the murder.Lee Harris does another masterful job of weaving her story, throwing in a few red herrings that will keep her readers guessing up to the end. It's another winner....and one more holiday that gets celebrated with a murder thrown in."
2,"great idea for a book, but this one is only so so","the topic of the book is fine, but it could have been done a lot better than this. it's too much of a bad rip-off of the style of old detective stories. it misses the mark by trying too hard to be sensationalism instead of sticking to the hard facts. i just hope somebody writes another book on this case and does it right."
2,Hollywood Kraptonite is more like it--- says Jimmy Olsen!,"I have taken a keen interest in the life and death of George Reeves, and have read quite a bit on the subject. These authors are spreading around alot of manure in the subtle hope that somethig beautiful will grow. When interviewed about the book Jack Larson, who played cub reporter Jimmy Olsen in the series, actually referred to the tome as Hollywood Kraptonite. While the book does paint a vivid picture of Hollywood in the 1950's, the conclusions drawn simply are not supported by the evidence. The simple truth of the matter is no one will ever know what really happened the evening of June 16, 1959. The principals are all dead, and the evidence destroyed. If the reader takes that into account and treats the book as a fictional account of Reeves' death, it is a quick read."
5,"Hollywood Kryptonite, One of the Best books I have ever read!","Hollywood Kriptonite: I read this book back in 1999. I'm a fairly steady reader, and this book is one of my favorites. It's not too long. It covers so much information. And It really sums up as much of the details as possible!! To me - it clearly shows the twists and turns of George's life and the complications and loose ends in his death. And some great irony of a comment by a man who claimed he loved the guy who played Superman. I won't give it away - don't want to spoil it for you.I have also read ""Speeding Bullit"" - later, and I liked it too, but this of the two I think is a bit better, really paints a picture. I highly recommend this book!! I don't understand any review that is below a 5 star. And by the way - the movie ""HollywoodLand"" - intended to be about George -- is a disgrace, avoid that DVD at all costs. A terrible portrayal by Ben Afflac. I think that movie was terrible!! Enjoy this book!! Scott MacNeil."
3,It's Like the Movie,"This book is a lot like the movie,""Hollywoodland."" There are photos of the real people involved, which were interesting to see. After I read it, I felt as if I had been entertained but I don't think the book (or the similar movie)answered the question of what really happened to George Reeves; was he murdered or did he commit suicide? If you are interested in that mystery, as I am, you should read this book and also Jan Alan Henderson's book,""Speeding Bullet."" To my mind, there are far more possibilities of what happened and who was responsible than either book (or movie) covered."
2,No plausible solutions here,"If you are not familiar with George Reeves' life and death, this book is interesting and provides quite a bit of factual background. Even after this book, the question remains: did Superman die by his own hand or was Reeves murdered? The scenario the authors present for the ""murder"" of Superman is hardly plausible. They suggest that the hired hit-man entered Reeves' home, while there were people (at least 4, besides Reeves) in the house, and that his plan was to use Reeves' own Lugar to commit the crime. Why would the murderer risk entering the rather small home while people were up and about? How could the murderer be sure that the gun would be on the nightstand, or that it would be loaded, or that Reeves wouldn't get to it first? Superman may have been murdered, but the version presented by these authors still leaves the mystery unsolved."
2,A repudiation of Hollywood Kryptonite,"I have spent nearly twenty years researching a biography of George Reeves. I am one of the people Hollywood Kryptonite is dedicated to. And though I admire the authors' other works and their ability to crank out a book on this subject in almost no time at all, I must repudiate virtually every claim they make as to the circumstances of George Reeves' death. Their conclusions are not borne out by the true evidence, and the evidence they use to support their conclusion is, at the most generous, questionable. My opinions do not matter; the only thing that matters is truth. And Hollywood Kryptonite does not present the truth about George Reeves' death"
5,Closure at last,"This book gives answers to the mystery of the death of a great and gracious man. It proves that George Reeves was murdered, and ends once and for all the lie of his alleged suicide. After reading this book, I did some additional research, spoke with Ed Lozzi, who was Toni Manix's caregiver for the last two years of her life. He was there when she made a deathbed confession to her priest that she personally order the murder of this man, because he left her for another woman. He tried to get the Los Angeles coroner to change the cause of death, but they refused because there was no court official or police officer present during her confession. It seems that the entertainment industry is as corrupt as the police department in that area. Even so, It is a huge relief to FINALLY see justice begin to emerge for the man who taught an entire generation to seek after truth and justice."
3,Great Sneaker... Wrong Color!,The sneaker was nice.. although I wanted it in BLACK and I got in WHITE... thanks Yahoo!
1,Not so happy,"The pump worked great at first. But has shut down twice now. The pond is green, so we have to drain and get the pump out so I can send it back.I know the product is good and the next one will be fine but what a hassle."
1,BAD PUMP,"I just boxed up my fourth and final Sunterra 204000 pond pump! The first three quit when the rotor seized inside the motor. The first pump lasted about one year, the second about six months, the third about one month and now the fourth pump continually trips the GFIC on the outlet after running about one month. I would definitely say there is a design or manufacturing problem. This one is going back to the store for a refund!"
1,Pump didn't last long,This pump worked for approximately one week and then completely stopped. Had to return it for credit.
3,I love Coco...not this,"I enjoy Conan O'Brien (Coco, for those cool cats out there). I have been watching him for years, and I was excited to get in on this action.My major complaint is the length...it is FAR too short. I was expecting more clips, more fun and just...more.The production values were on par with his show, which is enjoyable. I guess for 68 cents, this is a good hour or so of enjoyment.Long live Coco![...]"
5,i loved every word....2 thumbs up!,"I met Antonio in Miami, FL when i went down there for school. I read this book and it blew me away. I knew then that I met a great author and his name will one day be known! I give it an A+!!!!"
3,Decent but Returned Items,"I purchased this product with great anticipation for my new little girl. Thankfully, I wanted to set everything up before she arrived because all of the items were too small for my crib. The plain white sheet didn't fit the mattress and crib bumper (which I didn't plan to use with my baby in the crib) didn't fit all the way around the crib. The items seemed to be decent quality but obviously in need of washing and ironing before use. I was disappointed the sheet was simply white and had no pattern at all."
5,Great Set,Great item! The kids love the design and I love the durability of the product. (The stitching is without flaws.) I've received many compliments from guests as well. It's a great set which includes many items.
5,Well Worth The Watch,"This was the first documentary I had seen by Tristan Howard and I was intrigued with not only the research, but also the cinematography. Tristan's work nostalgically reminds me of that awe-inspired feeling I got when, as a young child, I'd wake up early in the morning and turn the television on to a documentary channel. His sequences are exciting, stimulating, and eye-catching, and his narrative voice is perfect for his videos. Some documentaries can be fairly dry, but this one certainly sets the bar and does not lack in accurate/interesting information or lively shots. My niece even sat down and watched this with me, so it is very child-friendly. I highly recommend this documentary."
3,Interesting Carradine Future Dred movie set in Totalitarian Future,"Young couple believes '1984-style' lie thatperfect place is right around the corner, ifthey can just escape there. Carradine as CopCapt'n has other ideas...A good one on modestbudget."
1,Poor Quality,Very poor quality I understand it is a used VHS movie but the picture was awful and the sound was poor and you could barely hear anything on it unhappy with this purchase.
2,SolidWorks CADCIM/S.Tickoo,Don't buy this book. CADCIM doesn't support their product. Student lesson/files not available for download. This is typical of CADCIM I've been this route with them before (see Revit review). Back spine of SolidWorks Textbook clearly labeled SOILDWORKS. How's that for proof-reading?
4,Best I've found so far,Reference books about SolidWorks are few and far between. As the program becomes more widely used we will undoubtedly have more books from which to choose. I have looked over and used many of the references that are currently available and in my opinion this one is the best of the bunch. There are omissions - no sheetmetal or configurations to name two - but what is included here is good. SolidWorks is a great program but learning it can be quite challenging. This book can make the experience easier and more enjoyable.
5,Refreshing,"I love this protein water. It is especially good and refreshing over ice. When I'm searching for a little something more than water, this is what I drink. I choose this over soda because it quenches my thirst."
4,It's Alright,"It tastes great. It might taste weird the first few sips because of the milk ingredients in it, but you get use to it.I'm not sure what it's suppose to do but it definently reduces your hunger (at least it did for me). I think its because of the protein. I recommend it as an mild appetite suppressant."
5,Lovely!,This is a beautiful coloring book and I am enjoying it very much. Thank you for having such a great product!
5,Coloring book for adults...G rated!,"Coloring in this book draws my focus into the art itself, like meditation...helps to focus and clear my mind of all other unwanted influences. Quite soothing and relaxing. Though I'm not the artist that created the design, my choices of color combinations are my own!"
2,Mandalas Stained Glass Coloring Book,"I found them kind of hard to color with pencils. The colors were not as vibrant as I had they would be. The designs, however were great."
4,Excellent selection of designs,"There is a good selection of designs, and the print is on both sides of the page. The mandala will come out in much more vibrant colors if you use fine tip markers and color on both sides. The look beautiful in my windows and my only problem is that they don't perforate the edges of the page, so tearing the finished product out of the book is sort of a pain."
3,Nice but . . .,"These are nice designs. But like all Dover Coloring Books, the designs are printed back to back. So if you use markers to color, like I mostly do, they bleed through and ruin the back design. If you prefer to use pencils to color, then this is a nice book--as are many of the Dover series."
5,Concise and well written,"This is a concise very well written book about a beautiful island, rich in history, on the coast of Georgi"
2,How to make Money,"This guide treats books like commodities to be bought and sold to make money. Almost the entire focus is on the BIG money you can make scouting books. It reminds me of those no-money-down real estate seminars where you can supposedly learn how to make BIG money! (Drop me in any city and give me a map marked with bookstores and a $5 bill and I will have a $1,000 the next day!) The author brags about how much he made by buying such-and-such a book and selling it across town for three times as much. In one case (he refers to it twice, actually) he made enough on one book to take ""a vacation to Europe."" If you love books, this is not for you. If you love money, you can probably make more in a different activity. Incidently, values seem exaggerated throughout."
4,Nice Overview,This book gives a nice overview of the used book/collectible book market. I am sure there is more to learn but if you want to know the basics this book does a nice job of doing that. Some reviewers have said that earlier versions did not talk about the internet well this on does. Although a big part of the used book market is dealing with people face to face and handling the books something you obviously can not do on the internet. Other reviewers have criticized the author for talking about money. The man is entitled to make a living he loves books anyone can see that from reading the book so leave him alone if he actually likes to make some money from it. Theres no way he would do this if money was all he cared about. I can't wait to begin trading my own books.
2,Outdated,"Without more extensive coverage of the internet marketplace, this book can only be considered out-of-date. For the most part, the kind of selling and trading presented here no longer exists as a profitable endeavor."
5,Now I'm a bookseller!,"This book definitely got me from just thinking about selling used books as a hobby, to actually doing it. Ellis provides great tips on what, where and how to scout for books to resell, and 1,000 titles to look for. The book is written in an enjoyable style."
1,Out of Date,"This book is completely out-of-date because it doesn't mention the Internet, which has revolutionized bookselling.If you have have access to the Internet and want to be a book dealer, this is NOT the book for you. If you are computer-less and have no concept of the Internet, then you are fighting an ""uphill"" battle and will only loose money being a bookdealer in this day and age."
4,"If you want to collect first editions, get this book","This is a very handy guide on how to collect books. The reason it only gets four stars is because it's a little bit dated. Most of the information is solid, but some of it is more than a year out of date and that's a lot in the fast moving world of book collecting. I do recommend it highly. You should have it in your library and the parts about how to negotiate etc are priceless."
2,good,The book is as it was described. I just didn't read the summary closely. It isn't what I was looking for.
5,Perfect for the Beginner,"I bought this book after it first came out, several years ago when I was just beginning to collect books. I was amazed at all the information this little volume contained. Before I read this, I was just haphazardly amassing worthless books. It really helped me to narrow my collection's focus and pay more attention to the condition of the books with its grading section. And it's a good primer not just for the collector, but for the scout and bookseller as well!"
4,Good Intro Book,"A good book on understanding and appreciating the first edition and rare book markets. Ian Ellis explores the market, identification, the book and the culture surrounding the used/rare/first edition book market. He gives tips and tricks to understanding where to buy, sell and identify books. A good book if you have interest in the topic."
1,Missing Pages,I ordered this book because it was required reading for a class I was taking. Upon receiving my book chapters one and two were missing! Very disappointed in this seller.
2,Not for Kids,"I have no issue with the product if it is to only be for display, therefore make sure it is not for a kid who wants to play with it since it easily breaks."
2,Poor quality,"Pretty much what the other reviewer said: it's a great looking knob, but it rattles and buzzes like it's filled with loose parts. For nearly $100, I expected MUCH better quality."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Yes, it's a great looking knob, but the top chrome piece and the chrome ring in the center are plastic. The mesh semi-sphere on the top half, while metal, rattled like heck even when tightened down. I had to dismantle the knob and add some rubber cushioning between the pieces to stop the rattling. For nearly $100, I expected better quality from MoMo."
1,fire hazard,"I love this oven for its compactness and cute appearance. But beware! The minute dial will turn past ""off"" and the oven will stay on when you think you it is turned off. Sometimes I walk out of the kitchen when I am cooking, but thank God I was in the kitchen, just happened to look inside the toaster and saw flames!! We were seconds away from a big fire. I would not purchase this product, and I plan to contact the company to find out why it has not been recalled."
4,Reason for embroidery arm positioning,"A previous reviewer left a comment that the hoop is on the wrong side. There is a valid reason for this. Unlike her PE-150, this machine is also a sewing machine. In order for this machine to function as a sewing machine, the embroidery arm has to be removable (so it is on the left side). If it was on the other side, it would be in the way for sewing.The other major advantage of the PE-400D over the 150 (besides being able to sew), is that it is able to read and use the Disney Brother cards. These cards can only be used by Disney Brother machines."
5,Brother 400D series,"I have owned this machine for several years now. I have sewed some and used the embroidery some. I do not sew everydday, or even every week, so it is not used excessively. I have had one problem with the machine that is frustrating, when you power it on there are lines that show on the screen making it difficult to see what is going on, They seem to grow in # in between my projects. I am afraid to even try the embroidery with it anymore, it is hard to see the patterns when all those lines are in the stitch panel. Anyone else have this problem? I probably should have returned it the first time it did that, now I am sure it is out of warranty and date.mutt"
1,Arm is backwards,I don't care for the design of the hoop holder... all the work must go to the inside of the machine and b in that small small area... not able to do it... I like the position with the brother P-150. I have that machine and wanted to upgrade to another model... But will not buy any machine that has the hoop holder on the outside... unless someone can give me a viable explanation...then I may reconsider... Thank you for allowing me to voice my thots.
2,"One of Playboy's better ones, but...","Of all of Playboy's Video Playmate Calender's, this one has perhaps the best selection of Playmates. Kimber West, Lynn Thomas, Nadine Chanz, and Kelly Monaco all are sizzling. The others aren't bad either, even if not as hot. BUT, as far as Playboy videso go, you can expect the same old fast-paced editing to raise the annoyance factor to an extreme. As soon as you get a good glimpse of the model, they cut to another scene. The movement of the cameras and the costume changes are TOO MUCH. If only they cut out half of the editing, reduced the number of costumes, and lengthened a few of the scenes, this would be a 5-star video. And what's with all the shots that don't even show the model?Get it only if you like these particular models (which I do). Otherwise, perhaps a Penthouse video is better advised."
2,Take a dramamine,"The girls are fine, so why don't I like this? The ending credits give a clue -- there are almost as many editors as girls. The scanning, panning, rotating, zoom-in videography is annoying enough. When you add the frenetic, artsy-fartsy, now she's naked, now she's dressed, now she's half-naked editing you end up with a highly annoying result. Playboy, get a clue."
2,Very Choppy,"This video is very choppy. The girls are very beautiful, but the excess editing and camera work ruin it. In one scene the girl is naked, in the next she is dressed, and in the next scene she is naked, and on and on it goes. With beautiful girls such as these, why do we need costumes at all. Playboy, enough of the ""Hi Tech"" editing, camera work, costumes and ""rock video"" style of production. Just bring on the naked playments."
1,Recieved broken :(,The pot is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately the infuser was broken when I recieved the package. I assume that it wasn't handled with enough care although its fragile.
5,My tea pot.,I like this tea pot. It looks pretty. It is easy to use. I make a pot of green tea everyday and enjoy it.
1,Broken infuser,"This is very poor packaging by both manufacturer and Amazon. I understand how some items could be missed ,but there has been alot of complaints about this product. You would figure that Amazon would got through the cases of this stuff and check them out and get a credit from the manufacturer for all the damaged goods. To much of a pain in the back side to return at my expense. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,BROKEN!,"I am usually always happy when I purchase from this site. However, this time, I bought my mom this glass tea pot for Mother's Day and it arrived today BROKEN. I am so upset. Inside the pot glass was broken off. Now it's all jagged. And the little bits of glass are in the pot. NOT HAPPY."
5,Love it!,"My teapot arrived on time and in perfect condition. I started using it right away, and I have not stopped. The diffuser is wonderful for my loose teas. The pot holds just the right amount of tea for one or two people."
3,not bad for made in China,"It's made in China, a tad small, but not bad for tea for 2. If you want something better, check out Polish Pottery. Bigger & better made in my opinion."
2,Blue Willow Teapot and Diffuser,"The Blue Willow Teapot was exactly what I had hoped and arrived in good condition. The diffuser, however, came in pieces. I'm okay because I don't need the diffuser, but I would have been very disappointed if it was the teapot that was broken."
1,Cheap junk - DO NOT BUY,Stay away from this chain breaker. I hoped for a few uses of this breaker but instead got only half way through my first job before the handle broke and threads started to cross thread. My Nashbar one was much better quality and only slightly more expensive.
3,It Was Okay.,"Based on the other review, I would think this was jam-packed with cover-to-cover details with stunning illustrations. Now, to be fair, I haven't read any other Utahraptor books, but basically, to me, this was almost like reading a children's book. And the formatting of the text on a certain page is a little strange. It's all pressed at the bottom, like the author or artist thought about putting a picture there, but then changed their mind. The pictures were fun to look at, especially for size comparison with other dromaeosaurs. However, to me, I think they spent a little too much time talking about T-rex and Allosaurus, but I guess it was good background information. (Though to me it seemed like they were trying to fill up pages.) Then again, this is a 1996 book, so they probably didn't have much yet."
1,cheep,i ordererd 2 of these 1 fit the other did not just a wast of money i have had simillar experiance with mr gasket in the past this is not the sellers falt
3,Nice FX for a first time Indie.,"The makers of this little Indie picture really tried to reach for more than the usual stalk and slash type movie. It's a little slow paced, which might lose some people, but there's quite a bit of thought behind what's going on. The performances aren't bad (some even quite good!) and the main highlight is the FX work. Yeah there's a few bad shots, but some are completely invisible. Also the musical score sounds like a big budget flick.The behind the scenes and out takes are a hoot! Pretty choice for some folks working out of their local media center (which gets a nod during the end credits)."
3,Not bad...,"I orignally bought this for making hard candy. So far I have only used it once for making carmels. The size of the final product was ok, I can see how it would be better for hard candy. My main issue with this item is that my candy pooled at the bottom of the mold. You can even see it in the product photo. It takes some time to prep the mold, as you need to add release agent, and assemble it on an easy to clean surface. I am glad I put mine inside a brownie pan lined with foil coated with cooking spray. I may use this mold in the future for hard candy. But if you are serious about making candy, invest in aSilicone Chocoflex Mold, it is well worth the money."
3,still in the box,"i ordered this for when its time to change the blade, so it's still in the box.....looks great!"
5,Grand! Beautiful!,"Vera Bila is a grand diva. The musical blends, and rhythmic patterns are just mesmerizing. An incredible first recording."
4,Charlottes Web,Charlotte's Web is the story of a girl named Fern. Fern lives on a farm and has a baby pig named Wilbur for a pet. Once Wilbur is big enough fern's dad plans to slaugter him for Christmas dinner. Wibur meets a spider named Charlotte on the farm who helps save his life. Charlotte helps people realize what a great pig Wilbur is by using her special talents of web making.I enjoyed reading this book becuase I like stories about animals. Most kids would like this book because all of the animals on the farm talk to each other.I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 8 because some parts are hard to understand and it is long.
2,Slow down there.....it's alright but not great.,First I've been playing for over 15 years. I know how to read and I got this to help my students. (Extra Practice) My first complaints-no cd. A student needs reinforcement and will ask questions that could be answered with the compliment of a cd. 2nd. The teaching method is odd to me. It throws alot of stuff at you that should be better graded in difficulty-again thinking with the student in mind. This book I would give a D+ or C. Depends on your level of musicanship and determination to work through his explainations..i.e. labeling beats D U N just confusing jargon. Good examples of stuff you will see in music. NOt a bad book for extra broadening your mind. I would go with a slower graded method with a cd. It will help you faster and reinforce the positive techniques.
3,Starts on a strong beat then fails off,"Counting beats, instead of notes, in the beginning of this book is easy. Whenever the author starts to introduce eighth and sixteenth notes, his method of reading rhythms gets confusing. A CD would help to clear any confusion about what the rhythm sounds like."
3,sight-read any rhythm instantly,"Mark's book is OK up to a point, what is lacking is a CD so we hear as well as see the rhythms, after all music is an aural experience. If Mark make a CD please let me know. Ken Nielsen"
1,It wuz scare,"and eih didnt get it, its not lick kul scare movys lick The Rocky Horror Picture Show or Don't Open the Door,"
2,"As far a horror movies go,","THis one is pretty decent. Ironically enough this series gets better through the sequels instead of worse. As a result this one is the _weak link_ in the Scream trilogy.You probabbly will want to get this one if you are collecting the series, but unless you are looking for a slasher flick, it's currently not worth the cost."
5,I enjoy it...,"it's one of my favorite horror movies. I love the humor in Scream (1). It's better than Scream 2 and 3 combined. If you like humor and like horror, I recommend this movie-however beware, it is not a horror movie where you jump when something happens (at least I didn't)."
2,"clever, hip, NOT SCARY","Kevin Williamson's script is almost as scary as an episode of ""Felicity,"" ""Dawson's Creek,"" or any other [work of his] he's put on television since the release of this unfrightening ""fright film."" Come on Craven, let's get back to the basics. The ending will not hold up to close scrutiny. The only thing this film did, was open the doors for alot of BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD so-called ""horror"" films like: ""Halloween: H20, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Halloween: Resurrection"" and ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."""
4,"Great Film, Great DVD, But It's Non Anaphormic.","The picture quailty is great. The sound is great. The special features are great.But it's Non Anaphormic, for those of you who don't what Non-Anamorphic is, it's basicaly this...If watch it on your Laptop, Blu-Ray player, or a HDMI 1080p Up-Converter DVD Player, the film will have thick black bars on the top and bottom, an black bars on the vertical sides of your TV.Get the Blu-Ray for a Anamorphic version of the film."
5,It's Time To SCREAM,"It starts out with Casey(Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend being killed. Then the story focuses on Sidney(Neve Campbell),And her friends Stu(Matthew Lillard),Tatum(Rose McGowen)Randy(Jamie Kennedy),and Sidneys boyfriend Billy(Skeet Ulrich).Then Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers(Courteney Cox)get involved.Then the princible is killed.The at Stu's party the murder begins.Tatum-Has her head crushed when a she tries to escape in a cat flap connected to the garage door button is pushed and it goes up.Kenny Gale's cameraman-Throat slashedThen the killers get killed thanks to Sidney. I wont say who they were though.Then only Dewey,Sidney,Gale,and Randy survive.In conclusion it is one of the best slasher films ive ever seen."
5,"Spine-tingling, chilling, pure suspention to the very end","Never letting know the real name of the killer is the best way of keeping the watcher's eyes wide-open even though the action makes you jump back reflectively from time to time. The turnovers of the action, nice shots, preatty good acting and the masterage directing puts this moovie on the top of horrors and thrillers' bests."
4,I loved it!! But it could have been better,"Ok the suspense definately ROCKS!! But Drew Barrymore is kind of stupid the way she just stands there and watches her parents coming down the driveway and don't even make an attempt to go get them.And then when they get there she can't talk and instead of throwing that phone at them to get ther attention, she just goes ""mom!!!"",and they can't even hear her!"
2,Could Have Been Better,"This movie really could have been better. I think that it had way way to much gore and junk like that in it, and I don't think that kids should be watching it. It gives them too many ideas. It really looked fake, but some actors were pretty good, Drew Barrymoore included."
4,SCREAM ROCKS!!!!!!!,"Wes Craven revived the Horror genre for the 90s' with this clever horror flick! Scream has a cool cast, a hot plot, and a gory ending!! When you watch the end, you'll be surprised to find out who the killer is!!! Plus the beginning with Drew Barrymore should be carved into the annal of the best movie scenes of all time, along side the Psycho Shower scene!!! I recommend you rent it first, than if you like it, BUY IT!!!!! Check out the explosive sequel,too!!!"
5,The total best horror movie ever!!!!!!!,"This is my favorite horror film of all time. I thought the characters were so great, and for its time, the Drew Barrymore scene was so scary. True modern classic. This is like the Psycho of the 90's."
5,Scream was the coolest movie ever,Scream was a real intense movie and it's a real scary movie and you should see it if you hav'nt seen this movie and neve campbell looks soooo good in this movie i could'nt stop lookin at her she looks soo fine and if u love scary movies you will love this movie
2,Not a movie i would buy,"Not a movie I would buy, i didnt know this was actually horror. I thought horror was suppose to be somewhat frightening and this made me laugh cause it was so corny. Then again my taste in horror is different I only really buy horror from the 70's and 80' occasionally some new stuff, very rare though. Any hardcore hoorror fan could tell you dont buy this. If its on TV and there is nothing else on i will watch it."
4,pretty good movie,I really liked this movie. Neve Campbel is an excellent actress and I was so surprised at the endwhen we found out who the killers were. Rose McGowen was great as Tatum. And Matthew Lilliard is really cute.
4,Delicously scary and original,The small town of Haddonfield gets terrorised by two maniacs that have a die hard love for horror movies. This movie is plenty scary and thrilling all the way. One of the best horror movies ever made. Rich and clever stuff.
5,I liked the movie,"Scream is the best movie i have ever seen. My favorite part of the movie was when they were cutting themselves. You guys should make another one like the first one. Scream 2 was dumb, and i am sorry for saying that but that is what i think. If you guys make another one you should have that ever her name is die. The knew one should be 2 teens doing about the same thing but just alot more killings and doing worse. Then let the guys get away with it because all of the murder movies i have seen all of the bad people die, i think that they should get away with it this time. Thank you so much for makeing screamCHRIS"
5,AWESOME HORROR FLICK!!!!!,"This is probably the BEST horror movie of all time! Wes Craven did an awesome job! I seriously don't know how you could not like this film! Rose McGowan was superb. Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, Courtney Cox, ect were also great. This has a great script, plot, and the acting is cool, too. RENT or BUY this movie soon. It is awesome."
5,"Scary, fun, exciting.","Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell : The Craft, Paint Cans) is not a typical 16 year old. With the murder of her mother Maureen and her boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich : The Craft) with raging hormones and the worst is still yet to come. After the murder of Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore : Everyone Says I Love You) the killer who most likely killed Sidneys mother is out on a rampage. No one is safe and everyone is a suspect. This movie is very entertaining and just make sure your alone don't pick up the phone, don't answer the door and most of all don't SCREAM!!!!!!!! Lots of fun."
1,Just another stupid teen slasher flick,"No big deal. You have seen it all before. A couple of cute slasher movie parody moments, but they don't do enough to turn this into anything other than the latest of a long string of teeny bopper chop-em-up movies."
3,Does Not Age Well,"I recently bought the Scream boxset for a very good price. I watched the first one and I was highly disappointed. The references to other movies got annoying and I hated the cast. I prefer 70's and 80's horror to most of the junk in horror today. It had a few good scenes but wasnt too impressed.I think Wes Craven is overrated. Ive stated this on anther one of his movies, i've even checked out the Interet movie database to see what he has done. Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and probably his best work. His other movies were decent but nothing could compare to Nightmare on Elm Street. Scream is decent but I wouldnt call it the greatest horror film of the 90's. Im sure someone will answer this."
1,This is armageddon....,"Total trendy tripe from the WB. We get stupid TV actors that every brainwashed teenager loves, and we get a flick that causes 12 year old Nsync fans to come to horror movies. Scary Movies? BAH! I prefer to call them ""horror movies"". That little imbecile Randy thinks he knows everything about horror, oh yeah? I bet if he saw Cannibal Ferox or Cannibal Holocaust he would friggin CROAK! I used to have little respect for Craven, and after this, I have none. This film only promotes overrated Hollywood yuppy trite like The Exorcist or Halloween, acting like those are the only horror movies ever made. This is the beginning of the end of horror. Say goodbye to horror, folks, cause the WB has taken over. :*("
1,Puhleeeze!!,"The ending was cheesy and I think the killers should have killed Neve just for her ""not in my movie"" quip. At the risk of sounding like a bore I have to piont out that anyone that riddled with bulletholes and stab wounds (I'm talking about Billy) is not going to get up again. I didn't find this movie scary, only cheesy. Not only was it improbable, but obvious. The second one is even worse."
2,none too good...,"This is a pretty annoying movie. I admit, once in awhile it startles you a bit, and sometimes it's even vaguely funny. But it's really nearly impossible to get past the oh-so-hip ""look at us; we're spoofing horror films"" attitude which is amply in evidence throughout. It's not a total waste of time, but that doesn't mean it's worth seeing. And really, the best way to see it is on Friday night in a theatre with a bunch of screaming high school kids. THAT'S certainly an interesting cultural experience. And...be sure to avoid the sequel like a cholera epidemic."
1,Packaging issues!,Worst packaging I have ever seen. You almost have to break and maul your discs just to get them out of the package. It's ridiculous. I am the biggest fan out there of these movies but no special features and really bad packaging makes it a pretty disappointing purchase.
5,A horror flick that mentions other horror flicks! Great idea,"First off I'd like to mention that putting a character like Randy in is excellent! And then, at the party at the end the kids were doing somthing new in a horror flick. They were watching one! ""Scream"" is a ground breaking rule braker! I loved it and so will you."
5,Best Horror movie ever!,I have been waiting ages to see Scream and now I have. I would reccomend that you don't watch it when your alone in the house. Its about a 16 year old girl called Sidney Prescot (Neve Campbell) who's mother was murdered a year ago. Suddenly two people at her school are found dead and the police hunt the killer. Not only this but the killer is after Sidney too. Enter journalist Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) who is trying to find a story and falls in Love with police officer Dewery (David Arquette). Drew Barrymore Stars. This film is full of suspence and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
4,Screeeeam !!!,"Just when u thought the slasher genre was wrung dry and all screamed out, Wes Craven returned to revive the genre he helped to create! Armed with a tongue-in-cheek attitude, a tight screenplay and a new cast (for 1996), Scream stood out as an original that year. This Blu ray transfer has excellent video. Audio transfer could have been better. Not as good as one would expect from a genre defining movie as this. Ditto for the extras. Would have liked more by way of back stories on the creation and cast interviews. But I love the movie and I'm glad I own the hi def version of this movie to keep!"
5,Greatest slasher ever.,"Everyone knows this famous movie. I just loved it since the beginning! It has a very clever script, great actors specially Neve Campbell, she knew how to portray perfectly a shy girl, but I seen her in other movies as a sexy one. Courteney's performance was also good. Every scene has its perfect moment to happen, and all the deaths were original and clever.If you're a horror movie fan, buy this movie and the sequels."
5,Scream,"Probably one of my favorite (horror) movies of all time! This movie is clever and has a few gags. And I just love it, it has a great plot and good storyline. It's better than a lot of scary movies out there. Scream has a great cast that are really good actors. Another Wes Craven hit!"
5,A Classic for Any '80s Baby!,Wes Craven's masterpiece is just as good as I remember from my Jr High days! The AV quality is good but the DVD's pretty skimpy on the extras - no matter - the trip down memory lane is well worth it!
3,Tatum's death,"Tatum Riley, played by Rose McGowan gets her head smashed by a garage door well, her boyfriend Stu has cats and in his garage, the car garage door has a open slot for the cat to come out of, and when Tatum runs from the killer, she goes underneath it and can't get out of it and the killer pushes the button to open the garage door and her head gets smamshed, and so she is hanging from the garage door."
1,This movie BITES!,"This was not scary at all, but was hilarious! Why did they spoof it, it was funny enough as it was. It ripped-off so many good horror films, and was so unrealistic and stupid, that it couldn't even be a suspense film! This is so dumb and it is nothing compared to The Exorcist! Don't see this for a scare, but if a good laugh is what you are looking for, than this is the one for you."
1,YAWN!,"This movie is so boring. It isn't suspenseful, it's definately NOT SCARY, with weak acting, an incoherent plot, and an idiotic killer, this film ends up being dumber than the movies it claimed to be rising above. I can't believe people got scared in this, it wasn't meant to be a ""horror"" film in the first place, it was actually intended to be a dark comedy, so you're suppose to laugh at this, not get scared in it! Just thought I'd clear that up. To all the lovers of this, I have to say... SUCK!!"
4,Pretty Good,"I always wanted to see Scream, but my mother would never let me. Finally, I convinced her to get it. I watched it and was surprised. It was a good movie but not as scary as I thought it would be. It was unique though especially when the killers always wear the masks (until the end). Well worth your money."
5,Don't answer the phone and don't trust anyone...,"This movie is one of the best modern horror movies I've ever seen, the post modern features this film presents is very clever. The movie is about a young girl, who's mother has been killed in the past and now the killer is back to find her and get his revenge for her being the daughter of the victim who caused an emotional crime against his will. The film is packed with action, very vivid violence, profane language, and all other things that make a teenage movie lover's delight! A very fresh young cast, mysterious plot, very scary and a perfect movie to show friends in a dark room. Just make sure no one is drnking, has had sex or said, ""I'll be right back!"""
4,if you like slasher films...,"I finally decided to watch Scream after reading all the reviews. A lot of people slagged it, saying it had no plot, and that Dawn of the Living Dead was an example of a true horror movie. I would say the Dead series are examples of true gore movies. Scream is not suspenseful as I would like, that I will admit. But the way they drew out typical slasher movie scenarios and re-enacted them their way was humorous and sort of a thriller at times, wondering who the killer was and who would be next. The ending was good. For the reviewers who said Scream copied other horror movies, that was kind of the point, or did you not pay attention to the movie? Scream is no Halloween (what movie is), but its a cut above most Halloween Sequels, Friday the 13th (all), and overall a fun way to burn some spare time."
3,Disappointing!,"I watched Scream for the first time today and I was really disappointed! I can honestly say that not once during the film did I scream, jump,get scared...... well you get my point: Scream isnt a scary film and theres no suspense. I know the whole idea of the film is the scream mask and it wouldnt have worked without it, but I thought it took away anything potentially scary because it was so silly looking! Also there was hardly any suspense at all, the killer just came running at the victims! The first horror I ever watched was I still Know what you did last summer which I didnt find at all scary but since then all the horrors I've seen have made me look at i still know, differently because it at least has a bit of suspense and you're on the edge of your seat at times!"
2,"Good movie, bad presentation","Just an FYI about this VOD version of ""Scream"": it's not in the movie's original aspect ratio (2.35:1). To some, this might not matter a bit, but if I'm going to pay money for a VOD, I'd prefer it be the same aspect ratio as the DVD. And if it isn't, it should be labeled as such.(Two stars for the presentation. The movie itself? It's great.)"
4,It was the best,That movie was the bomb. It was the 3rd best movie I had ever seen. 1st was- I know what you did last summer. 2nd was I still know what you did last summer.
2,"""Scream"" is least best of Wes Craven's career","I happened to have loved ""A Nightmare On Elm Steet"", but this was a little cheazy for me, and I thought it was kind of childish. What make's this film watachable is the fine acting."
4,Another Horror Hit for Wes,"Director Wes Craven(Nightmare on Elm St.) has done it again. Another horror movie that you'll never forget. I didn't see Scream at when it first came out because I honestly didn't think it would be worth the $8.00 to see in a movie theater. A friend of mine rented this movie and told me it was worth seeing. It certainly was. It stars big named actors/actresses such as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Jaime Kennedy and Courtney Cox. Scream has a typical horror movie plot with plenty of blood and butcherings, however, it also has a mystery throughout the movie on who the real killer is. Also, throughout the movie, they make plenty of references back to some of the classic horror movies such Halloween and Psycho. Scream was big enough to spawn two sequels and I believe is the reason movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend were created. If your a fan of suspensful horror films don't miss this one. Scream is definately worth the price of admission."
4,"""Scream"" resurrects the ""slasher"" film","A crazed horror film buff wearing a ""Father Death"" costume is making mincemeat out of the locals in the sleepy little town of Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) discovers that the killer is getting closer to her as the one year anniversary of her mother's murder approaches. A coincidence? Lots of scares, laughs, suspense, in-jokes for horror film buffs, red herrings, and a few cameos (Linda Blair, Henry Winkler, and Wes Craven) as well as memorable characters. Probably the most complete and satisfying horror film trilogy ever; writer Kevin Williamson wrote drafts for the two sequels at the same time!"
3,Predictable but fun to watch anyway.,"Anyone who is willing to think about it can pretty much figure out what is going to happen next, although the end is a little less predictable. I wouldn't call Scream ""the best movie of the century"" by any means, but it is still an enjoyable movie to watch."
5,It rocked!,"This is one of my fave movies. It was scary, funny, and fun to watch. If you havn't seen it yet, RENT IT!! OR BUY IT!!!I have the movie."
1,worthless...,"This is about 2 hours of sugar-coated unrealistic idiocy. The characters are totally phony and fake. It's scary that Hollywood puts profits so far above artistic creativity turning the little teenieboppers into mindless cattle, ready to consume anything with expensice effects and the idolized television stars. This movie is totally not scary, irritating, and dull. The acting is overall pretty bad too. Not worth 1/1000th of what it cost to make."
1,Why do people like scream so much?,"ok everybody likes scream, but this is a bad bad movie! there is no plot, no scares ,everybody said it was the scariest movie ever made but i almost fell alsleep and found my box of popcorn more exciting than this.then hardcore scream fans defend this by saying its not a horror movie if it isnt then why is it in the horror section in my local video store, why do 85% of scream fans say its a horror movie? why does wes say its a horror movie? and the script tries to be witty, but its witty to maybe a 4 year old i am 14 years old its target age group and i hate it! dont by this Buy Suspiria instead! so if u like dumb actors bad scares with sudden loud noises {the cheap way} and a killer u can guess even though they try so damned hard to make u think he is not the killer then by all means buy it. but if can see though the hype and good reviews then save your money for a better movie"
2,25 Word Or Less Review,Nowhere near as clever as some movie reviewers and studio hype would have you believe. More a mildly effective black comedy than a horror movie.
2,2 stars for the humor,"This movie is so incredibly bad, it's hilarious. Anyone scared by this movie should go out and see a real horror movie like the original Psycho. But this movie's so funny it earns 2 stars. We've got the principal who keeps scaring himself in his office before he is killed, we have the stupid blonde bimbo w/ the fake... being stupid enough NOT to run away from the masked man in black, and overall all of the poeple who die in this movie are pretty idiotic. How much of it is a good idea to chat with a guy who's asking you about scary movies, honestly? And let's not forget how idiotic we are to get back with the guy arrested for being caught with the cell-phone. This movie sucks as a movie, great camp value."
2,I was very disapointed.,I really don't see why everyone thinks this film is so great.I hate it because it's plot has been done hundreds of times.I am a huge fan of Wes Craven but I think this movie just stunk.Later.
3,I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!,"A great horror movie! I was surprised when I first saw this movie. I thought it was gonna be like Friday The 13th, dull, stupid & just f*cking bad! ( Excuse The French ) But it turned out to one of my favourite movies. A great plot combined with great acting & a scary looking serial killer. Overall a mildly scary & suspenseful movie but the sequel sucked!"
5,The best horror movie,"This, is the best horror movie ever made! Unlike other stupid horror movies, that showded us things like monsters, death mens, this kind of junk (like Jason, for example, or Chucky). This one is inovating, new, fun, scarry...."
2,A little bit original.,Rather than just have a killer slashing 24-year-old teenagers we have a mystery killer slashing 24-year-old teenagers. The worst thing about this movie is the flood of imitations and sequels it will/has spawned.Anyone who thinks that this movie has suspense should rent some Alfred Hitchcock flicks like 'Rear Window' or 'notorious'. Scream has no suspense. No slasher flick has had suspense since John Carpenter's Original Halloween. The others just repeat his formula. Patheic.
1,STunk,"This movie stunk. Don't see it. It's the gayest movie ever made. I would give it 0 stars, but it's not allowed."
1,bad,"This movie is such a rip-off of Friday the 13th its not even funny. Not that friday the 13th was good either, but better than this movie. This movie would of been better if the teens in this movie acted a little smarter, I mean come on these people kind of grew up on horror films and they don't even follow waht they are suppose to do to stay alive and they already know the information. Take about stupidity. I found out who the killer was in the first 15 minutes of the movie."
2,Do u like scary movies?,"When I first saw the movie I was totally in love with it. But that was in like what? 1997. Anyways, I still think its a really good movie, but not scary at all. The first time I saw it i did think it was, but after that I was like "" and why did I think this was scary?"" But the plot in the movie is really good and original. I also like how they make fun of other horror movies. This is one of the best teen/slasher flicks though. The Sequals are pretty good. I read someone else's review and I totally agree with them on how the third one probably wasnt the way Kevin wanted it to be. I would have like to see what he came up with as the last installment. But whatever, the guy who wrote it still came up with a good idea."
2,Overrated,"A surprise smash hit when first released, the first installment in Wes Craven's Scream series is overrated to this very day. It's not scary one bit, and some of the characters are so annoying you'll actually be cheering for them to meet their bloody demises. All that aside though, Craven does manage to put some ingenuity into the film by attempting to deconstruct the teen-horror genre outline and instilling some of the main characters with actual intelligence, something in the later installments of film series' like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th was lacking. Scream has a few quick moments of brilliance here and there, but all together it's pretty much predictable mainstream shlock horror. The second film managed to be better than the first, but the third and final (?) film was the worst of the series. The cast features Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, and Henry Winkler."
5,IT'S A SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THis is one of my all time favorite horror movies. It's even better than scream 3 which is very good. It's Stars, neve campbell, david arquette, henry winkler, courtney cox and more!!!! This movie is scary. It's better than the halloween and friday the 13th series. Do yourself a favor and buy it!!!!!!!!"
4,It's a scream baby,"I didnt see this movie in a quite a while, and to tell u the truth, I wanna see it again.This is worth watching, but if u wanna see scary stuff, dont get this movie, but if u wanna see action and blood, get this movie."
5,"''these days you gotta have a sequel""!",I'm 12 and I saw this when I was 8 sared the $%&# out of me then and still does. 5 Screams(stars).
5,Classic SCREAM! 8-D,"****WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!***I love this movie. It's a kind of funny/horror mix of a movie. Everyone is perfectly cast-Neve Campbell of course (who I also loved in ""The Craft"") and Skeet Ulrich in particular is especially GORGEOUS/SEXY/SCARY. I was shocked to find out several years later that he has quite a range-check out his extraordinary performance in the Hallmark movie ""The Magic of Ordinary Days"". Quite an understated talent. He's terrific in the ""Jericho"" series as well!Highly recommend this awesome horror classic with a twist! :)"
4,Scream DVD,I was one of the fortunate to view all three flicks at the cinema. This is definitely the best one of them all. There is just one issue that this DVD is lacking from the rest: WHY ISN'T THIS DVD ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN PRESENTATIONS ON 16:9 TELEVISIONS LIKE THE OTHER ONES ARE?
5,GREAT MOVIE,This movie is great the acting is great this movie is really worth seeing.It is one of my all time favorites.The 2nd and 3rd are even better.
4,it was all good,"this movie was so good. drew barrymore was awsome. i was so scared when i saw it, but whatever, just see it"
4,A GREAT HORROR MOVIE BUT TOO MUCH DELAY IN THE END.,"Dimension Films make really good horror movies but this had to be one of the worst. I mean, it got off to a good start, but like all dumb chick horror movies, there wasn't much practicality. I mean, Drew Barrymore kept hesitating. When she got out of the house, she should have ran like her life depended on it, which it did. But she didn't fight back and she got gutted. And why did Tatum try to wiggle her big hips through the cat door? That was truly dumb; she should have kept fighting him and went into the house or opened the garage door. Maybe you'll make it better next time, Kevin."
5,"You Go, WES!!","This is the best horror movie I've ever seen. It's so decieving and intelligent. It made me watch it at least 5 times the first day. Neve Campbell is fantastic in this movie as 'Sydney'. This is also the most funny horror movie I've ever seen. The actors and actresses are fantastic. This ending was the biggest suprise of all. I absolutely LOVED this movie. I would watch it a million times if I had to. If you haven't already seen this movie, either rent it, or buy the movie. I guarantee you will really enjoy it."
5,BEST MOVIE!!!!,Scream is great cause of its scares and the plot is great as well.Neve Cambell and Courteney Cox and hot in this as well!!!!
2,A disgrace to it's genre,"SCREAM is one the most unfunniest Horror spoofs ever made (next to SCREAM 2). It has a cast full of yuppie.... like Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox (who is so ....), a downright dreadful plot, not enough gore, awful soundtrack and lousy direction........ But the start is unforgettable with Drew Barrymore getting slashed and hung, it comes right at 'ya otherwise SCREAM falls flat on it's face. Followed by an even-worse sequel."
2,NOT a horror movie.,"I'm sure everyone's already seen this movie, but here's my review anyways. If you want a horror movie, don't rent this, there is not ONE scary scene in it. However, if you want a comedy, yeah, it's pretty good for that. The reason for the 2 stars is because this is in the horror section, and it isn't horror."
4,Bonus features on Blu-ray a little underwhelming,"The film itself looks fine but not spectacular on Blu-ray.It is presented in enhanced widescreen, which is nice for those like me who haven't seen it that way yet.The bonus contents listing brags of a behind-the-scenes featurette and some other similar footage. Each of those runs a scant 3-7 minutes. Not much to get excited about. I am about midway through watching it with the Director and Writer commentary track. It is interesting but not compelling.At this writing, Amazon is offering this Blu-ray at a substantially discounted price. It is probably worth the purchase at this price but I wouldn't pay regular price for this if I were you and already owned the DVD."
4,Scream Review,"Scream is a suspenseful slasher with fine score by Marco Beltrami. The dialog and acting are good. Unfortunately, the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is NOT enhanced for 16:9 TVs, but the picture and sound are very good, though."
3,PRETTY GOOD. friday 9th april 2004.,"The very first time i saw this film i would of rated it 5 stars, but after watching it a couple of times it as got really boring. It isn't really scary, but gory. I like watching this film but not as much as i used to do. Its based on a serial killer but i won't tell you who, who is phoning people for a game and killing them. Then he or them is after someone else. But one person manages to get away each time. GORY,TERROR AND HALF SCARY."
5,Love it.,This is my favorite horror movie and has been for a few years now. Good quality and was shipped relatively fast. I am satisfied with the product and the company. I would buy from them again.
5,best scream movie made,im not a horror hound but i do like my random slasher film marathons. to me scream was the last good slasher film (that wasnt a remake of someone elses genious). Like so many slasher films the original was better. It was both bloodier (the death of casey and steve being the bloodiest of course) and funnier (mathew lillard was classic). the thing is the rest of them were also great. It unlike the slasher films that followed but like the original halloween knew the power of a knife to put the audience on the edge of their seat. I sift through my horror movies from time to time getting rid of the ones that ive seen too many times and just dont have the same effect anymore but the scream movies always survives the cut. fine friday night fun.Rose McGowan was in this one its gotta get points for that right?
4,The start of a downfall...,"Scream was great and that's pretty much all there is to it. Not the best movie ever made like alot of these people are saying, but it was probably one of the most entertaining films of 1996. I think, and some will agree with me here, that the reason why people give this movie such a bad rap is because it was the mother of all these new teeny bopper horror flicks that have penetrated the movie scene. I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, the Faculty, Disturbing Behavior and now this new Final Destination movie. People probably wouldn't complain so much if they had to go through all that slasher hooplah that dominated the late 70's/early 80's. But it's easy to understand where they come from. Frankly, I'm getting kind of sick of it. But Scream stands alone as the best of all of them. Urban Legend was better? Give me a break. I'd reccommend this if you have an open mind and not ready to judge at every golden opportunity you get to put a good movie down."
1,This was Hysterical!,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever scene. Don't these people know that this was intended to be a spoof on the slasher films. This was hysterical. I gave it one star to let people know that it wasn't scary. If you want scary see The Ring, The Exorcist, and Halloween."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"this movie was so boring. the olny part of the movie that was good was when the killers were stabing each other. that was funny. every thing else was like ""he jumps out. see. he's the killer. see. this is go ing to happen. see."" so perdictable."
1,Not even remotely scary,"This film was tolerable at best. I've seen real horror, and this sure aint it. Throughout the entire film I was able to predict to myself what was about to happen. I think it's time Wes Craven does away with boring, predictable conventions and gives us a real scare."
1,I screamed but not for the movie.,"This movie is very representative of the use of gratuitous violence by Hollywood for targeting people with a commercial product. Wes Craven himself said that cinema was another way for making money. I agree with him, but in that case, does it mean that cinema became useless as a medium of creativity and imagination? Teenagers are in a age where contestation is a way of asserting their personality, this is normal, but Hollywood producers are aware of that fact and insert gratuitous violence in that contestation because they can make a lot of money. This commercial process leads to movie like Scream where there is no plot, no acting, but a lot of gore and violence used as meaning of expression. The characters in that movie are very weak, are they really representative of the young generation of the United-States ? or are they only caricatures of young people trying to convince the real young people that in the USA the life of a student is so delicious and violent ?"
4,About a pshyco killer.,"Well for starters, drew berrymore is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend steve to come over and watch a scary movie when she recieves a phone call from a sicko, he asks her questions and then turns it into a test, if she gets it right steve can live because the caller has him hostage, and if she gets it wrong, well, bye-bye steve. He asks her the question, she gets it wrong and they both die, I think that that is the best part. Also when Matthew Lillard is on the phone with syd and he's bleeding to death and says ""My mom and dad are going to be upset"""
3,Good,Good but if you want to See a real slasher movie see Scream 2. This is one oif the odd things that Scream2 was better then the first. My Top Five list is 1. Scream 2 2. IKWYDLS 3. Halloween H20 4. Scream %. Halloween
3,"""Scream"" Is One Of Those Films","You know those films that boost you up as one of the big boys in Hollywood? Well, this is one. The film that started Kevin Williamson's short lived golden age, Neve Campbells star power, Courtney Cox's sucess other than T.V.'s Friends, and so on, gives us an original treat... in slasher terms anyway. A great whodunnit mixed with laughs and of course screams is one of the most fun slasher films of all time. It isn't the greatest film in the world, but it is works with what it is tring to do, make us scream."
3,not scary enough,"Even though this movie provided a creative take on horror flicks, it wasn't scary enough for me. The sequel was better."
2,Ehh......,"I know I typed a review for this several months back, and I liked it. But it seems the more time goes by, the less I like it. I really can't explain why. It ain't the gore (i am a huge fan of celebrity deathmatch). It ain't the one scene where the guys throat gets slit. (i can take that stuff!) I DID see Scary Movie though, which really put it to shame. Scary Movie rules!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I don't know why, but it just isn't as appealing anymore. The Scream 3 soundtrack was awesome though."
2,"okay,but barely","This is a good as far as teenybopper movies go-but it most definitely will NOT go down as a classic.It barrows way too much from other better movies,including the movie that started it all-John Carpenter's Halloween.Watch it if you like good movies-watch THIS if you you're looking to kill some time.Problems:That costume is a bit dorky,making me want to laugh rather than scream.Neve Campbell overacts from time to time,and comes off as whiny.Do we really need yet another slasher movie?Didn't think so.The gross over-use of pop culture refrences to appear clever is enough to make anyone gag.The best thing about this is the begining.the rest is just twenty-something actors trying to act like teens,and doing an almost okay job,with an occasional smattering of (obviously)fake gore here in there to please fans."
2,Pretty good movie...,"An okay plot has a murderer who has watched too many horror movies murders people he(or she, or them)knows.Very gory, but suspenseful and scary. Although isn't overall a great film."
5,One of my favourite horror movies,In a small town of Woodsboro murders start to occur after the massacre of Maureen Presscott. Noww the whole city is under curfew hoping they will not be a target. With the awesome directing by Wes Craven and a incredible screenplay by Kevin Williamson. A must see!
5,BRILLIANT!,"This is by far one of the best horror movies ever made, much better done than the godawful FREDDY series. Though please buy this(UK viewers!) before they ban it here. Two 14 year olds watched this movie then went out and stabbed another kid, and they had supposedly been influenced by it. Horror films do not make people kill. It's the fault of the parents who could not bring them up properly. Scream is an 18 certificate in the UK, so why did the foolish parents let them view it? Anyway, such news can add to this film's cult status. So ignore the do-gooders who try to ban everything and watch this. It is a classic in the genre, need I say more?"
2,Well...,"I`m not really into this type of movie, but for its genre ""Scream"" definitely isn`t too bad. Unfortunately, it`s not that great either, presenting a decent plot with a couple of convincing twists. Director Wes Craven manages to deliver some suspenseful situations here, yet the overall result never rises above average and not too surprising material. At least, ""Scream"" is still better than most of its clones that appeared everywhere during the late nineties, offering a competent and watchable entertainment. But it`s just that, a disposable and forgettable entertainment, far from a truly remarkable cinematic experience.I`ve seen worse."
3,Good But Not Scary Enough,It Was Good But It Really Didn't Have me On The Edge Of My Seat Like Movies That Include Halloween Friday The 13th And The Texas Chainsaw massacre It Could Defintertly be Better but Still Worth renting
5,You don't know the rules?!,"Scream is a movie that doesn't let go of the thrills and nailbiting moments till the end. From the now Classic opening scene featuring Drew Barrymore, to the shocking end of this great film.The movie revolves around a character named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). One night two of her classmates are brutally murdered and now the killer is after her. Police believe there is a connection between this killer and the one that killed her mother a year before. Slowly, people around Sidney start dying and she has to try to survive and find out who the killer is.This movie is mysterious in a way because throughout the movie, the killer could be anyone. You have no idea who it is until the end of the movie.This movie also includes an allstar cast including Courtney Cox and David Arquette.I recommend this movie to anyone who loves slasher movies, or just loves movies period."
1,Needed TONS of work,"I thought Scream made a very obvious imitation of horror movies. It had very little suspense, and was very poorly formatted. It made little sense that Drew Barrymore was a star of the movie when she was in it for only ten minutes. I rank this movie out of 1-10 with a one."
1,whisper,"not only one of the stupidest horror movies ever made, but also it is the film that ushered in hordes of other mindless horror flicks that have brainwashed the ""teen"" crowd. i remember when wes craven had excellent ideas. ten years ago this film, and all of it's ilk would have been straight to video or late night USA movies."
2,What a shame,"Scream was a great movie, probably the best documentary on other horror movies ever made...what's that you say? It's not a ducumentary about other (better) horror movies? Oh. Well then it was pretty lame. When a movie spends more time quoting other (better) horror movies than making its own lines, you know something is wrong. Aside from all the referenced copies of other movies (the Halloween music plays during the end in the house, for example) this one also copies about every horror movie ever made without saying so. The beginning is a huge rip-off of ""When A Stranger Calls"", which was in part of a rip-off of ""Black Christmas"". The characters are card-board cut-outs of every kind of clique imaginable and have no real qualities. Yes, the cast was very good, and there are a couple suspenseful moments, I just with those moments were the movies own, and not taken from others."
2,I thought the ending sucked,"The video had me terrified. It was a good concept because the killer really scared you when he talked on the phone to his victims. The mask was scary. Even though he looked like he was in a dress at times. It was very frightening up until the end. Which really really REALLY sucked. It was the stupidest ending I have ever seen, just like in Scream 2, but they might have written it that way, to make people realize that it was just a movie. It was still scary up until the end though."
2,blondie14_88@hotmail.com,"I would have to say that scream is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. For those of you who say it's intelligent, no offense but get real. What is so intelligent about some stupid killer going around butchering people. The end is so ridiculous I was almost laughing. The only bright part of this movie was trying to guess who the killer was."
4,Collectors Series nothing to SCREAM about!,"I don't know how good the original DVD of Scream is but I do know it has the commentary on it. All this one has is a bunch of Trailers and TV ad's and some lame a** behind the scene's footage. I can't find the special effects gallery, maybe i'm retarted or something. Now don't get me wrong I think SCREAM was a bad a** flick but when I spend $40 on a DVD I want some nude pic's or Rose Mcgowan or something. To sum it up if you want to save money just get the original>at least it has the commentary."
1,Unwatchable,"Like other viewers, I was unable to sit through more than about 20 minutes of this thing. The main characters are utterly detestable."
1,"Too stupid to watch, don't waste your time on this crap.","This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It starts off well enough but after Drew Barrymore is killed it's all downhill from there. The acting & script are so bad I had to stop the movie after 38 minutes. This is not worth renting much less buying, if I could give it less than one star I would."
1,One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. -,This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It starts off ok but after Drew Barrymore is killed it quickly goes downhill from there. 38 minutes into the movie I couldn't take any more & turned it off. Don't waste your time on this garbage it's not worth renting.

5,Another great book by Ann Rowe Seaman,"Ann Rowe Seaman has written another fascinating and captivating masterpiece. It works well in paperback format, but a hard bound edition would have been nice to see as well.Ann has a way of drawing the reader into the life circumstances of the persons whom she is writing about. She deserves a Ph.D. for all of her writing efforts."
4,Good phone,"I have now had this phone for about 2 months now. It's a good phone I can listen to music now since my mp3 broke. It took me some time to get used to the user interface. There is lots of customization on the phone, wallpaper, screensaver, ringtone which can be any song from your media list. camera's fantastic at taking close images if you try to zoom on things it gets blurry, but you are working with a 1.5 megapixel camera though. No games on it if you care for that thing just sort of putting it out there as this is a review for the entire product. The only problems that I have had with the said phone is that occasionally you might lose a call or the volume isn't high enough on a call even a full volume. The lost call thing might be a service error or just based on location though I do live near some mountains. The phone comes with an adapter so you can use your own headphones, and not the cheapo ones it comes with."
1,2 disk on list only one inside a new package. Not good.,2 disk on list only one inside a new package. Not good. 4 movies out of 8 were the ones I didn't want.
4,good toy with a few problems,"""I saved my money to buy this light saber. I bought this one because I wanted one that retracted fully, but I do wish that it could light up. Sometimes it is kind of hard to retract, and the plastic blade is turning white in a lot of places where it hit something hard. It's fun to battle with, but that's how it got white. The belt clip is easy to use. I think the light-up ones might be less durable. I sort of recommend it."""
1,Stars Wars E3 Basic Lightsaber Green 1,This was not very sturdy. Easily breakable. Should give more information on this product before purchasing.
2,Not for 7 year olds/older,"My 7 & 4 year old grandson's did not enjoy playing with the Sith Lightsaber, they wanted it to do something. The blade (light) would self retract."
3,Fair toy for fair price!,"We bought 3 of these light sabres for our kids. They all seem to enjoy running madly around the house brandishing their Star Wars weapons. They were a bit disappointed that they don't light up, but I think they'll live. Tough enough material to have survived several weeks already in our household."
1,I hate this toy!,I ended up buying 3 of these because they all had a defect.Heres what happaned on my 1-3 lightsabers:1.It smelled so horrable it made me puke2.the saber part wouldn't come out3.the holder was to big and the saber part was to smallI've had many horrid times with this toy
3,"Good book for comic writers, not for conversations.","Originally I bought this book to become funnier in my conversations with others. The title seemed to imply that this would happen, but after reading the book, I found it to be a beginer's book for the comic writer and stand-up comedian. Very little was mentioned about how to develop a funny personality. A total of 10 pages out of 290 were devoted to formulas of why things are funny and this list of reasons was lacking in comprehensiveness. Although I do not doubt Steve Allen's ability to write funny material, I feel he lacks when it comes to writing analytical material. This book should have been titled ""How to be a Comic Writer."""
1,This Book Ruined A Vacation,"Thank God Steve Allen is dead, to save me the trouble of beating his skull in with this useless pile of puffery. Did you know that Steve Allen invented every comedy technique known to man? Talk about about a bitter has-been. Seems that the guy rambled into a tape recorder and some jack-ass typed it up. My problem is that I must finish a book once I start it. Steve Allen, you owe me."
5,Early Art Appreciation,"I bought this book along with two others from James Mayhew's collection for my two and five-year-old daughters. We enjoyed learning about the artists, types of paintings and history. After purchasing this book, I ordered another one as a birthday gift for a six-year-old and took the kids to a local museum featuring Impressionism. It is a great book for introducing famous art pieces and familiarizing young children with art history. Katie's adventures allow the children to step inside the paitings and experience various imaginative scenarios. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in exposing young children to art appreciation, which can begin at an early age."
5,I want it!,"I found this book at the Museum Shop in the Louvre. I stood there, flipping through the pages, laughing at the text and admiring the illustrations. I said I was buying it for my children but I really wanted it for myself.Katie Meets the Impressionists is a fun story with beautiful illustrations, a great way to teach children about Monet!"
4,Great Book!,This was a very nice book to use as an introduction to art appreciation with a Pre-Kindergarten class. Wonderful story and it was easy for the children in our school to relate to.
3,A good book,"A good book, kids really enjoy it. I would recommend to anyone who wants to introduce Impressionist art for kids"
3,Artist Mom wanted to love it,"This story is pretty good. My 3 year old daughter LOVED Katie and the Mona Lisa by Mayhew (we bought it for her when we went to the Louvre this past spring). I was excited to find more of these books on Amazon, and the Impressionists are my favorite artists... so I REALLY wanted to love this book. It is just okay. Better than average and consistent with the first book we owned, but she and I both like Katie & the Mona Lisa better."
2,The White House: An Illustrated Tour,"The title of this book is quite misleading. Wanted a book that would give our class a tour of the rooms of the White House and its gardens. This book shows you old hats and gloves and things worn by Presidents. There is far far too little information about the actual White House. For one who teaches children who may never visit the White House, this book was really did little to increase thier knowledge nor may I add, hold their interest."
1,They took the pages off...!,"Funny, got this book mainly to appreciate the White House inside and to my surprise Amazon took most of the pages out bofore sending it! Either as a security measure or a total coincidence all of the photographs from the actual inside of the White House were removed from the book I got which kind of reminded me of the paranoia following 9/11. Also reminded me of that scene in Seven if you saw it.They did leave the pages from the old White Houses though; thank you very much A.Why did i not returned it? Makes for a perfect funny story/NSA Souvenir sitting on my coffee table...!"
2,Save your money,"Micah Ashley is really really beautiful and really really shy. It takes almost the entire video to get to the totally nude segment. Even then, she seems really uncomfortable in the nude segment. So, save your money on this one."
4,When God's People Pray,Very well done. Encouraging. Wish it had also addressed prayers that don't seem to be answered.
5,Small Group teaching,Jim Cymbala mixes video teaching with real life stories and bible basics to create one of the best small group studies I have been apart of yet. I highly recommend this to any small group looking for a fresh study.
2,Description of Item not Accurate,"The description of the book was not accurate. The description sounded like a DVD was included. Without the DVD, the book was not helpful. With the DVD, I expect the book will be very good. I'm not blaming the book or author, but the seller who provided a poor description of what was included (the DVD)."
1,Ready to scream,Trying to thread. Impossible diirections. No Mac disc called Brother. No Mac disc available . want to scream.Wonder can I return this thing. FrustratedMrs. Ed. Feet dry
3,works great so far,"The serger arrived on time. I was a bit intimidated by it, having never used one before but I listened to the dvds and took notes specific to serging sheer material. I changed the threads and dials as suggested and started serging with no problems. The dress is almost done. I only wish it could do coverstitch."
5,wonderful service,I ordered it on a thursday morning and received my merchandise two days later! Awesome and prompt service
1,Received BROKEN,"I received this serger as a gift for Christmas, after much research. I have wanted a serger for years. Intimidated by the machine, I watched the DVD's, read the manuals, and scoured the internet on serging before I even got it out of the box. I bought all new thread, cut a pattern to test the machine, and finally took it out to give it a first try. And...BROKEN.The hand wheel would not even turn. I couldn't do a thing with it. I called Brother, and they referred me to an authorized repair shop-- the closest was 45 minutes away. I called the repair shop, and of course it is not an easy fix, and they told me they would have it for as long as three weeks. Thankfully, this gift was purchased on Amazon, and they swiftly offered to send me a replacement machine and return label for the broken machine. Hopefully I'll have better luck with the next machine. What a disappointment to have my only Christmas gift arrive completely non-functional."
4,love it,"Hi well I love the overlocker. Everythining is great about it execpt I wish it would of stated better that is didnt come with the cone thread, other than that I love it. It has so many settings and I find it easy to use."
5,I love it....,I've always wanted a Serger and put it off and off. Finally I made the plunge and I'm so much in love with it. Easy threading and came with extra attachments. I watched the videos and was very comfortable using the Serger after that. Loving it...Maggie
4,"so far, so good","I was really overwhelmed by this when it first arrived. I thought I'd never figure it out, and the video tutorials were small and dark. So, I set my husband after it to figure it out, because he's the brains in the family. Well, he cursed at it for an entire evening, so I was feeling very defeated. The next day I decided to take another stab at it, and read through the threading instructions in the book..and honestly I have NO idea what he was doing differently or why, because it wasn't difficult at all and I got it first try.Now I've had it for a week or so, and I've had time to mess around with it and I must say that it's really not difficult, and the videos do help bunches.I love it, and I'm VERY happy I bought it!"
5,"A welcome, needed product","I sew an immense amount of products using fabrics that ravel tremendously. A serger is absolutely necessary for this type of sewing from my point of view. I had one before that I fought for years. It was extremely difficult to thread and was constantly breaking it's threads. This one has yet to break it's threads. The instructions were not too clear as to how to thread it but once I realized how it was done it is a piece of cake. An added plus is the fact you can use ordinary spools of thread. If you want the most elaborate serger made this probably is not for you but if you want a totally functional, workhorse that will serve you well at a reasonable price this is a perfect one for you. I have a Brother sewing machine and it is the best one I have ever owned and I have had many. I ordered this serger hoping it would be as good and it is."
5,great purchase,"Don't know why I waited so long to buy. This is a must have for seamstress it simplifies sewing, by triming seams and overlocking seams, The time that this machine saves will pay for itself. The easest searger to thread also."
4,Great work..,"I'll admit I haven't explored all that the can do, but I'm very pleased with the results so far. I've only been finishing edges with it. I'll also admit that it's going to take a while to get used to threading."
4,light bulb,I am pleased with this proxy. I would have have gave it a 5 but 15 minutes into first project light bulb burnt out. Very discouraging. Now I need to find out where to get a new bulb. :(
1,got a lemon and no response for refund,"With 20 years experience with sergers, I could not get this one to serge. Have since learned from serviceman that this model gets out of adjustment, which would equate to increased cost for the maintenance required. This off-site seller has not responded to inquiry for refund and return. Unhappy experience."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I used the serger once; when I went to use it again....the presser foot lever broke. By this time, the product was out of warranty with Amazon, so I was forced to call Brother for assistance. When I called, the customer service rep was very nice. She took my information then told me that the product had to be returned to a Brother Authorized Service Center, which just so happened to be an hour and a half away. Parts are covered under warranty, but labor would not be.I proceeded to find out if I could just order the part to avoid the approximately 6 hours of driving (dropping off and picking up); and wasnt able to do so as it is a service only part.So, I have a $200 Serger that has been used once; that I must spend more money on if I ever want to use it again (because of the poor quality of the product).Will I buy another Brother Product again.....ummm probably not."
3,Pretty good for the price,I have only had this machine for a month- it has managed all the last minute projects I had to finish when my previous serger died-great price- lots of new easier ways of adjusting stitches- I do wish it was a bit quieter-and had more interior lubrication instructions- Thank you J
5,Sew far so good!,"I feel like I was stalking this machine for a long time. It got great reviews online, but I did see some ppl say not to buy a brother period. I think those ppl have the money to buy the professional ones. I saw this machine priced as high as $320 I was shocked to see it at Amazon for almost 100 cheaper. It is a great machine. I watched the dvd and looked through the book. Took me no time to thread it. (I am just an average person) It is easier to tie the new thread onto the existing one and pull through, but I had to try it the hard way first. I whipped up some placemats in less than 1/2 hour. If your just a domestic goddess like myself and looking for a serger (this is my first one) I would get this one. It is a good buy and a nice lil machine. I am very happy."
5,Great machine for the money!,"I was hesitant to buy a serger - not knowing if I would use it enough. I was also kind of intimidated by the threading process that goes into these machines. My concerns have been put to rest. After years of doing french seams or finishing edges with zig-zag stitches, I was delighted by the professional results this serger provides in short order. It was easy to set up and use the first time. The manuals are clear and easy to understand, and the accompanying dvd's helped to clear up any questions I had. Even when one of the sample spools of thread ran out (I wasn't paying attention, I was having too much fun!) and I had to re-thread the entire machine it took less than 15 minutes - and that includes re-watching a part of one of the dvd's.While a serger can't do everything a standard sewing machine can, if you're serious about your sewing, this machine is a great addition to your sewing arsenal."
1,Don't waste your money,"This serger was purchased as a Christmas gift in December of 2011. By August, it need repairs that were not covered under the ""wonderful"" warranty. When I took it to a reputable repair shop, I was told that it would be $200 to repair it. He explained how the machine is made so cheaply that it will have something else go wrong with it again. The machine does not handle any fabric thicker than 3 layers of cotton. Good luck making garments or anything with any type of bulk. When I spoke with the Brother Customer Service, worthless by the way, I was told I was out of luck. The nearest ""certified"" repair shop is over two hours away and the timing was not covered under the 5 year warranty. Be sure to read the fine print."
5,Great Investment,"After wanting a serger for a few years, but not wanting to make the investment, I took a serging class at a high end store. The serger we learned on was $1700 w/o any additional feet. The lower end serger for this brand was $500. I saw a review for the Brother Serger and researched it on-line. I made the purchase and have been very happy with this serger. It came with two DVD's which I found easy to understand. I've made a tent cover, a market bag and sergered seams! I am very happy with the Brother Serger!"
4,brother serger,received my serger and two things were broken haven't heard back from brother co.weither they will be replace yetleft hanging what do do?
4,Good machine but terrible instructions!,"I love having a serger! This is my first experience with one, so I'm still in a learning curve. There are a couple of things that stopped me from giving it a higher rating: First, the instructions provided aren't very good. They provide a DVD that is not at all helpful because the narrator blocks the view and it is in small screen mode and can't be made bigger. I had to search on youtube to find good instructions. It is pretty hard to figure out how to thread the loopers if you've never used one before! (I did call Brother, but the Customer Service Rep didn't help at all!) Second, it is pretty noisy! All in all it's a good machine for the money."
5,I've been waiting for you...,"Been dreaming of a serger for years. Found this one at a great price and could not be more thrilled. I've used it on a variety of different weight fabrics; works just as well on thicker fabric as on sheers. Instruction charts and manual are very helpful, clearly written and well laid-out. Easy to thread, runs like a dream."
3,Second Machine,"This is my second serger. 3 years ago when I received my serger it was threaded correctly and I started useing it immediately. This machine came with the thread tangled and knotted. I could not get it to thread properly and working. I took it to a Brothers dealer and had it checked out. It was just missed threaded, but if the machine was not threaded right when it was at the factory shouldn't the inspector had noticed the problem and fixed it? When running the first machine it sounds like a quality running machine but this machine sounds tinney when it is running. I have only had it for 2 months so I hope it works as well as the other machine. I use both machine all the time."
5,Never used a serger before,"I have never used a serger before and was really nervous when I purchased this serger. The demo cd that came with it was very helpful and I was able to thread the serger with no problems. The serger works great for me - yet I have just been using it for the basic projects. If you are looking for an easy to use serger for your basic projects, than this is the serger for you!"
5,first serger ive owned,"i'll keep this short since there are a ton of really looong reviews about how great this is and all its features (i read a lot of them myself before purchasing this one) and they're all true. Im just now starting out with my first serger and i can honestly say i absolutely LOVE it. and wish i would have done this sooner. its true at first they can seem a little daunting, but when you use one for the first time youll wonder how you ever got along without one and see your creations go from amateur to professional looking just like that. i love love love my new serger. no regrets :D"
5,Almost perfect!,"I love how easy it is to thread and how well it is working so far. I have never had a serger but have always wanted one. I have signed up for a class just to make sure I get it right, but the instructions were simple and the video was very helpful. The only things I would change are very small: 1) provide an attached holder of some sort for the extra feet and tools that came with it. A zip lock baggie (listed as if it's some great extra) is just not my idea of helpful. 2) on the video of the specialty stitches, make it so I can choose the stitch from a menu and view the video of just that - same for the instructions. that way I don't have to view the entire video of to get help. I have been playing with it and plan to start to really use it next week!"
3,Broke within the first week,"I was loving this machine till it BROKE!!! This is my first serger and I found it very easy to use. Watched the videos and referenced the books and I was off and sewing. Then tragedy struck, I was sewing a purse made of wool and when I came to a thicker seam instead of stopping the whole arm that runs the needle bent sideways. There was no way to fix it. Luckily amazon took it back and refunded my money without any problems. After thinking about it for a few weeks I decided this must have been a fluke and I'm going to try it again, so I have ordered another of the same -- wish me luck!"
3,"Brother, 4 thread serger","This is an average machine, the threading is not ""lay-in"", but neither is it imposssible. Need to be sure to change to cone type thread for good thread feed, and to thread by ""the number"". Finished stitch is adequate and will serve for finishing seams."
4,Extremely pleased,"Fast, efficient ordering/mailing/delivery. Machine perfect in every way except it came with the goofiest thread. After you order the machine make sure you buy four spools of serger thread, too!"
5,More than I expected!,This serger is so awesome! I Love it! SO much better than the Singer Serger I had. Will by Brother products again.
4,Just what I needed and more,Does just what I needed it to. Hard to thread for a rookie but after practice it became easier. The price was great too.
4,Easy threading,Recently bought serger. For the money this serger does the job and I would recommend. Only objection I have is it is noisy.
5,Works right out of the box,"I haven't had this machine very long. I gave it 5 stars because, right out of the box, I could use it. The DVD's are great. I have another (expensive) serger that has been a thorn in my side from day one. I purchased this serger because of the reviews I have read. I've done more on this machine in the two days I've spent learning it, than I did in the 7 years I owned the other one. This one is not fancy, it does not have all of the bells and whistles, but I am delighted with it. And, Amazon had the absolute best price around for this machine. I checked."
4,Great serger,"Just received the Brother 1034D 3/4 Lay-In Thread Serger and I am loving it! I still have much to learn, but the Brother website is very helpful with a step by step on your questions. Made two blanket throws in less than an hour. I would definitely recommend this machine."
5,Awesome!,"This serger is everything it says it is. It is easy to use for a beginner like me, and does beautiful sewing. I have no regrets whatsoever. The price was the best I have seen. Awesome product!"
5,bought as a gift - she loved it,"My wife has always wanted a serger... She had pointed this one our about a month before Christmas... but it wasn't in the cards until after Christmas this year. So, we ordered it. She was excited! It arrived and she was like a kid on Christmas morning... Now, she's able to serge her seams - something she has always wanted to do...."
3,"Would Return it, if I could","Okay so yeah if I hadn't already used this I would return it.Why, well first it's loud and noisy! Even with proper oiling it's loud!!!I bought this machine to use as a second serger to my small apron business. I figured it would be easy to thread for those aprons I choose to change the color of the thread. Well, yes it is easy to thread and adjust. But, the negatives about this machine out weigh the positives.Secondly, the knife doesn't not adjust on this machine unless you totally don't use it. Third, the feed dog on this machine is rough to thinner fabrics and can easily rip your fabric. Even with adjusting the pressure to the feed dog.Thirdly, the engineering of this machine makes it easy for the fabric that is being cut to fall in the machine and jam it. A real pain!!My Juki far outweighs this machine in both engineering and ease of use. And yes I would love the opportunity to return this machine!"
1,Sorry,"Unfortunately product is good there are many problems I did not expect this thing of a large company such as brother, I hope to improve these problems"
3,Why don't they include ...,Why don't they include a carrying case... It's beyond me to imagine why they would not include a carrying case if not just to protect it during shipping and to give you the option to store it while protecting it. I hate the nickle and dime mentality. It doesn't sell more product it just makes you have to guess when looking for a carrying case weather or not it will fit or be proportional to the size of the small serger. I haven't used the serger yet I am still reading materials and viewing items sent in the dvd's they included with the unit.
1,Disgusted,"I bought this serger and was very excited to get started learning to serge this weekend but when I took it out of the box I can't even plug it in...it has a foreign plug!!! It doesn't say anything about this in the description. So now I'm stuck either sending the whole thing back or finding an adapter that will convert a european plug to an American one. There are a lot of converters out there that will go the other way, convert American to anything else, but I haven't found one yet that will convert european to american...unless I buy one at Amazon...isn't that convenient for them!"
2,NOTE TO AU BUYERS,"The product itself if great,However I am in Australia and nowhere in this description does it say its not suitable for AU buyers!I have had to purchase a new peddle that is suitable in Australia. Not happy!"
1,"Uh, No","I was looking to buy my very first serger after all these years. I went with the Brother 1034D serger based on all the positive reviews. Boy was I mistaken. After I watched the demo (which ran fine on my Vista x64) and read the instructions I set it up and tried it out. The first thing I noticed was that the machine's motor ran rough and felt and sounded really poorly made. That is a big strike for me. The next thing that I noticed was how awkward the placement of the controls were. They were not intuitive to use if you have ever used a regular sewing machine before. In a nutshell, I didn't like the feel of it, I didn't enjoy using it and I didn't think it would last very long before breaking down. I returned it the same day I received it. I know this is a budget serger but even so I was quite underwhelmed and will be looking for a different brand."
4,No need for fear,"I'd always heard that sergers were hard to learn, and hard to thread - but once I got over my initial fear, it just wasn't so. Threading is mostly self explanatory, though it's hard to distinguish blue from green for the looper paths.Experience is the best teacher. Experiment with scrap fabric, using the same stitches, thread and tensions as for your finished product. You'll soon love what this serger can do!"
2,It was great while it lasted...,"I used this serger heavily for about a year. As time progressed, it seemed like the tension was getting weaker and weaker and I had to keep adjusting it up. Then, while I was changing the needles, the needle clamp broke. All I did was try to tighten the clamp with the little hex wench and it snapped into pieces. It's made of cheap (and brittle) plastic. I tried to remove the needle thread guide (the metal piece that wraps around the needle bar) to get a better look at what was broken. The screw that holds the thread guide in place is made of cheap soft metal and was almost impossible to remove without stripping. I ended up having to buying a new needle clamp online (still waiting for it to arrive) and a new screw (for the thread guide) from the hardware store."
5,Sewing Satisfaction,"I have been sewing for 40 years and needed to replace my serger. I wanted a reliable brand name and set high end $300 knowing I could do it and still get quality and simplicity in operation. I shop Amazon online all the time and have never had a bad experience. I chose the Brother after comparison shopping, they've been around for a long time and have a good reputation, the price was right, it arrived within 7 days, instructions were well defined and I was sewing within 45 minutes."
1,"Broke, now it clunks","I purchased this model in 2008, and have used it occasionally. It was having problems this year, so I took it in to a local shop, who charged me a hundred dollars to fix it, but told me this model just plain wears out faster and that it was a poor purchase. Seems like it would be worth it to spend twice the price on a better serger (NOT a Brother) and maintain it half as often. I am very disappointed."
5,Excellent machine for the money,"I have been an avid sewer for years. I have always balked at the thought of spending the money for a serger. After reading the reviews here, I decided to take a chance on this machine, and have been delighted. It is truly easy to thread (for a serger). The directions are concise and the thread path is shown on the machine.Recently I was in a shop selling a well known, high end serger. I asked for a demo of the threading on it. This $600 dollar machine was a nightmare to thread compared to this simple Brother. It does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive machines, but it does what it advertises very well. I feel it was an excellent investment for the price. I gave it a five star recommendation on the capabilities of this machine. I am sure there are more expensive machines that may do more, but for the cost, this is a 5 star purchase."
4,brother serger,I bought this machine to replace an old one. Threading with the lay in type is pretty easy. The machine worked well tension wise from the start. Directions are easy to follow. I think this machine is a good alternative to the more expensive ones. It does what I want and much more. I am a happy customer of Brother products.
5,Perfect... if you read directions,"I bought this serger because I was working a lot with knits. I am new to serging but as a beginner I think this is a great machine. If you read and refer back to the directions it is easy to use and quick to adjust. There are pictures of different stitch issues and ways to solve them. Even though I had never used a serger before I was comfortable using it within a couple of hours and have since used it for knits and wovens, for gathering, rolled edges, and finishing seams. So far I have had no problems with it that couldn't be solved by referring back to the directions and making the recommended adjustments."
5,Brother 1034D 3/4 Lay-In Thread Serger,"After much research, I decided to purchase this as my first serger. I was able to successfully thread it the first time using the instructions in the book and the diagram on the machine. I have no serging experience and wanted a decent, reliable machine at a reasonable price to start with. Based on other reviews, this machine seemed to meet my requirements. So far, I have been very pleased with it. It may be too basic for advanced users but I think it is a good machine for beginners."
4,Easy to use.,"They weren't kidding when they recommended NO PINs used with this machine. I broke the cutter knife with one pin and had to order another. Once you understand the threading, the machine is a little work horse. A real good machine. I don't know how to do curves and corners though. Maybe I should only do straight runs. The cutters cut too much out of curves and corners so I should just read reviews to find how best to use the machine. The DVDs that come with this machine are CRAP. Use You Tube and get good, high-def instruction."
4,Brother Serger,"Love it, compared to my old Singer Baby Lock,this works like a dream. So far I've only used it twice and had to change the thread once it was ""child-splay"""
5,Love My Serger!,"I love this serger! This is my very first one and the cd/videos were very helpful! I can now thread my machine alone, thanks to colored guides on the machine. It seemed intimidating at first but it's a great one! I've had it over a year now and have never had any problems. I recommend it to everyone, beginners on up =)"
4,love it,I learned how to thread from dvd and instructions are ok. I'm not a pro. There were a lot of adjustments left for trail and error. It's easier to use on sturdy fabric versus thin and stretchy.
2,hard to use,"I got this as a gift from my mom and reallllyyyy want to use it... but i just cant figure out how to thread it!!! I am a newbie and have no experience at all with sergers so i cant judge the machine. however, the instructional disc that came with the machine was quite confusing that i watched it over and over again and tried several times but never got it right. at the end, i got so frustrated and gave up... I cant say if im just stupid or the machine itself is hard to use but the serger is now just sitting in the storage without any use..."
5,sewing with ninny's closet,for many years I have used singer sewing machines. last year I decided I wanted to purchase a serger so I bought a singer I hated it. about a month ago I ordered the brother and I love it. the only thing I would change on this machine is how the fabric goes inside the machine after being cut by the cutter other than that this is the easiest serger to use I have ever found thanks brother for your wonderful products.
5,Sewing Joy,"After much research I finally purchased a serger. The Brother 1034D is everything they say it is. I have been sewing for 46 years and this has put some new joy in sewing for me. The only thing I have found it that it does not sew with smaller eyed needles. Not sure if it is me or the serger. Smaller needles break the thread. I will have to do more research and experimentation to figure this out. But I have made several sets of scrubs with the serger and it worked liked a charm. The video is a much see for threading and I was able to correctly thread it the first time. If you are looking for a serger, this is the one for you. Priced right, quick delivery and a joy to own."
3,Good beginner machine,"However I am not a beginner. This machine lasted me less than a year before it's first trip to my local dealer. Since then I've kept is as ""extreme"" back up since I have 1.5 real sergers. Well I brought it out for an ""extreme"" moment. Didn't last a day. Back to the dealer it went.I've paid more in labor and parts than I paid for the machine.Like I said if you're a beginner, or a very casual sewer this is your machine... But if you're a sewing goddess like me, you'll find yourself very dissappointed in the machine."
1,WORSE MACHINE EVER!!,"THIS IS MY SECOND BROTHER SERGER IN 4 WEEKS TIME. DOES NOT SEW OVER ANYTHING HEAVY AT ALL!! IT BROKE THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT ON HEAVY JUMBO SPANDEX, BOTH TIMES. GREAT FOR LIGHT WEIGHT FABRICS, BUT NEVER FOR ANYTHING HEAVY. I HATE IT, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BROTHER AGAIN! ...AND I'D LIKE TO ADD, I'M A PRO. I SEW FOR A LIVING, THIS WAS NOT OPERATOR ERROR. IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE MACHINE. AWFUL!"
4,Good value for the price!,"For your money this is a good machine. Although it has a lot of plastic, it has lots of extras that my worn out Baby Lock didn't have. The free-arm design is great. The fact that it uses regular sewing machine needles is a plus. I like the presser foot lifting lever on the right side; very convenient! Also, if you check prices elsewhere on this machine, most don't come with the extra feet, trim trap, etc. The CD's that come with it are priceless, even for someone very experienced with this type of sewing."
3,No gradual speed,"I bought this Brother serger as my first one. I have never serged before and am very excited yet intimidated by the whole concept. It was delivered sooo quickly, ordered on Sun. w/ free shipping and it was at my door on Tuesday. Way before I ever expected it. Threading was pretty easy since the diagrams are on the machine. Ok, here's where I'm struggling. I try to start slowly but the machine won't go. It just kind of revs up until I push down really hard and then it flies and I can't control my fabric. It's completely different from my sewing machine b/c there is no gradual speed. It's all or nothing. Is this normal? It's absolutely impossible to sew a curved seam b/c I have no control. I'm so bummed b/c everyone says how great this machine is. Either I'm an idiot(which I'm not) or I've got a lemon. I'll keep messing w/ it and post again if I figure it out. The straight seems look very professional."
5,Easy to use and does beautiful work!!,I bought this serger after seeing good reviews on it. I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use. I've been intimidated by sergers in the past and even returned another brand after many hours of not being able to figure it out. I have had great success with this one. I like for my work to look finished on the inside and this machine does a beautiful job of that!! I am very glad I decided on this serger and would highly recommended it to anyone!!
4,Works for me!,"I love this serger. Granted, I have never before sewn on a serger and have no expectations of what it can do other than the obvious. But for the price, this is a fun little machine."
1,Used three times and it is broke and will cost $150 to fix,"I made two fleece hats with this. Then I recenly started sewing a dress out of cotton and had all kinds of trouble. This is a poorly built serger. The presser foot broke and the design is inferior in the way it operates. could not be fixed by reputable sewing machine store. I had to manually operate the presser foot. Then it jammed and would not sew at all. took it back to the store and they tell me it is a tension error and must be sent out and will probably cost $150 to repair. I paid $199 to purchase it, so putting another $150 into it is ridiculous. I apparently bought a lemon. Very disappointed. I would suggest you purchase another serger and research it very carefully. get one with a better warranty. I wasted my money."
5,very pleased with purchase,I read the other reviews on this site before deciding to purchase this serger. I was really happy that it was already threaded and was able to stich a little bit right away (I watched the DVD and read the book afterward.) I soon had to learn to thread though. The color coding really helped. I had the most difficulty threading the lower looper...I suggest being patient and reading the directions carefully. I am so excited with the results. It is neat too that you can use regular thread as well!
3,Brother Serger - only 1 problem...,"Love my Brother serger 1034D except for 1 thing - I used it only 3 times and the presser foot wouldn't lift. Took to a repairman who said that the gear inside is plastic and it stripped, and probably would continue to do so even if replaced.I use it without lifting the presser foot, but it sure makes it unhandy and sometimes frustrating."
1,Bad product?,I used this serger once. It didn't perform the best stitches. It was jamming up and I didn't have time to try to examine the problem. I finally rethreaded it and found the mechanics of the machinery is not working properly. It had nothing to do with threading it. I took it to a repair shop and it will be $169 just to look at it. It is to late to return it for any refund.
2,Where is customer service?,"I bought this for my mom and there is missing part. so i emailed to customer service in brother company since there is NO Option button for "" contact seller"". However, i didn't hear anything from them. How can i contact seller? Is ""brother"" company is the seller or there is someone else? Help me!!"
1,No Sew!,"Poor quality. Arrived dirty and grease coated with thread jammed everywhere. Spent several hours sprucing it up, read the instructions and was ready to sew but the machine wasn't. It repeatedly jammed amd was a true pain to use. Turned me off to buying another Serger."
2,Returned,"I wanted to use this serger so badly but could not figure how to thread it for the life of me. I am a beginner and have no experience with sergers so I do not blame the machine at all. I am sure it is easy to use but I couldn't figure it out. I looked for a tutorial online because the instructional disc that came with the machine was not compatible with my computer. I watched the tutorial over and over again. I tried and tried. I thought I had it but never got it. After a week of trying, I just gave up and sent it back."
2,Very rough and loud operation.,The Brother 1034D Serger is very rough. Does not have a smooth flowing motor sound. Sounds like a loose belt or as if something is rubbing against other parts. It seems diffective. It almost seems as if I was issued a refurbished machine that was not completely repaired. I did not receive the bilingual operations manual nor the instructional CD. I would like to see if someone will get back to me on these items.I was out of the country for a few months and did not open the box until today. Returns expired at the end of July. Too bad because it would be on it's way back.This is the first time I have had a problem with an internet ordered item and I don't know exactly how to handle it.
5,Love this serger!,Easy to use and easy to thread. A great serger! I am very pleased and satisfied with this machine. Awesome!!!
4,Ms Minogue goes dramatic and fans will love it!,"Now, I have been a Kylie fans for years, and I think seen almost everything she has ever done! Including several Mardi Gra performances! Kylie has, and always will have, old fashioned star quality...And, she has it in this film too, in abundence!Kylie herself once said, she's still around cause she does a bit of everything...but, this film proves she does a bit of eveything very well!Kylie shines here in this light romance, that as it rolls along, will charm even the most harden viewer! Okay, it is not high art but it's better than most CGI films around today! Ps. Kylie sings Tears on my Pillow in the closing credits!"
1,A very poor choice for a lens.,A very poor choice for a lens. Would not recommend this lens unless it comes with a generous return policy.Lens is not sharp & has very poor contrast.
3,Fun to look through not a lot of information,The book is a lot of fun to look through. If you have already purchased several books on Victorian sterling and plate this would be an interesting addition to your library. If this is the only book you will be buying on the subject your needs would be better served by another book. This book conisists of turn of the century catalog reprints. The reprints are sharp and they are interesting to look at but there is not a whole lot of information.
1,Material not on the test,"I just finished taking the Network+ test. I failed. I have 3 years troubleshooting experience. I have multiple certifications so I am not new to taking the tests. The reason I failed is because I believed the customer reviews regarding this book. Only a fraction of the practice questions, both in the book and on the CD, are on the test. If you wish to pass this test I would strongly recommend purchasing another study tool."
5,Real good book for a not so tough exam,"This book is an excellent primer on the world of networks. It was pretty easy to read but covered a real wide range of information, just like the exam. I thought the exam was pretty easy but it did cover a wide range of topics. The book must have prepared me well because I finished the exam rather quickly with a 95%. Either the test just wasn't as tough as I expected or this book was better than I thought. This was a lot of the same stuff as the Networking Essentials too, but with a little more detail and a lot better explanations and samples than the MS book. I wish I had this book for that test I wouldn't have flunked it the first time. The TCP/IP section was real complete too, I may just try the Microsoft TCP/IP exam next. This book is complete and all you'll need for this test and probably a few others too."
5,"Perfect book for the exam, and then some","Excellent book for taking the exam. Lots of detail and examples. These were so many questions in the book and on the CD that the test seemed second nature. I could probably have passed just studying the sample questions. It truly is a book full of useful information. It stays on my top shelf now that the test is over so I can use it quickly when I need to. That's more than I can say for a half dozen other ""exam"" books that are worthless to me now. Get this book and you'll have one you can keep."
3,Pretty good but.....,"I initially thought that this book read very well and provided good information to pass the Network+ exam. However, after I purchased the Transcender practice exam and failed it, I thought differently. All of the questions I failed were referenced to David Groth's book, ""Network+ Study Guide"" which, once I purchased and read it, found additional material not covered in the Corolis book. After reading both books, I successfully passed the practice exams, and subsequently, the actual test. There were a few questions on the actual test that weren't covered in this book, confirming that the Transcender practice exam(which I highly recommend) was right on the money. I recommend if you can only purchase one book, buy the Network+ Study Guide. Best of luck!!!"
5,A Great Book to Add to Your Collection,"This book was very well written and was my primary study tool. I bought two other Network+ books while studying for the exam and looked at several others, this one was one of the best. I don't think you can go wrong with the purchase of this book."
2,Update to my previous review,"To the author's credit, the tables on subnetting are correct. However, the method they give you for subnetting (thus determining those tables on your own) does not give you the right numbers. My rating still stands since their explanation was wrong and I still had to spend hours on the internet to determine the correct method."
2,Not worth it...,"Don't waste your money. Although this book covers basic networking very well, it is not a good prep for the Network + Exam. I nearly passed the exam, but not because of this book. Keep looking!"
5,Three Years & Running,"I bought a pair of Tommy Hilfiger shoes back in 2002. I payed Fourty dollars for them. The shoes I had lasted me three years, the only reason I threw them away was because even though they were still my most comfortable shoes they went through some wear and tear. The rubber on the bottom of the shoes started to come un-glued, and I got a couple of holes by the toes due to wearing them for working, playing, and every day life. So I went to research and find the same shoe, unfortuntely I didnt find the ""Exact"" shoe I found this model: It's layout is the same as my shoe, the only difference is the colors are modified, and I get these new cool velcro straps for the shoe laces. Anyways, I've had these new shoes for a week now, as of 01-27-06 and they feel almost exactly the same as my old ones.I hope these will last me another three years."
5,Great investment for a working musician,"I've had this preamp for roughly 11 years. It's been used live hundreds of times and at practice thousands. I've recorded with it at home and in studio and it still works as great today as the day I bought it, even after many nights of being kicked, stepped on, beer spilled on it, and infused with cigarette smoke from the bar patrons. I've gotten many incredible sounds out of it but found that I have 2 personal favorite settings: one for rock and one for jazz.The sansamp is also a great boost for passive basses and gives them power without distorting the sound. All in all it's improved the sound of every bass I've ever owned from low to high end. Well worth it."
4,"Makes a bass sound fuller, more detailed","Like any decent preamp, the SansAmp expands and refines the soundof the electric bass, whether in the studio or playing live.My friend has one and swears by it.And I concur."
5,Phoenix Rising - e-book,"Besides the fact that I prefer e-books to hard-covers, Mary Summer Rain is a really great writer, especially in this particular work of hers."
5,Phoenix Rising book--a great book!,"This is a wonderful and unique book written by Mary Summer Rain; it is lively and contains visions of things to come (some already happening)as told to her by the Native American blind elderly lady called ""No Eyes"". I had a copy of this book when it first was published and it apparently became lost, so I am delighted now to have a copy of it again."
4,The Great Unknown Revealed,"This book is a look into the future, which can look as if it is happening now. The events written about so long ago can leave the reader either frightened or prepared. The author shares openly about what is revealed to her."
5,ANOTHER MUST READ!!,"This book is for real! Everyone should read it! Themore days that go by, the more the wisdom of No Eyes'is proven! If you want an idea of what the futureholds for humankind, and what you can do to help makethat future a more positive one-READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,mala encuadernacion,Me resulto imposible de usar. La encuadernacion es pesima y cuando se abre las paginas se desprenden una tras otra.
1,"Oh, how cute I am, I know dirty words","This is one book about Howard Hughes that should be returned to the book seller if bought without reading it first. The author, an Englishman, apparently tries to be ""popular"" in America by being clinically dirty. His ""shocking"" revelations have no references, and he seems to be a grand master of the ""he undoubtedly said..."" school of research. The book certainly does not belong in a family library, and as far as university libraries go, it has no scholarly value."
5,Solution to the main financial problems facing businesess,This book is more than a problem solver.The information in this book help me to convert my business from a loss maker to a profit generatorGlen Brown
4,Excellent book,An excellent account of not only the political and investigative process but also the hardships these people faced growing up in Russia.
3,An amatures viewpoint,"If you purchased the book based on the movie, then you shouldn't have an issue. The two are almost interchanceable;however, as a former homicide detective (and no disrespect to Soviet law enforcement) the investigation portrayed in the film and in the book, to me, are beyond childish. I had hoped to obtain an insight into another madman's M.O. and the techniques used to identify him, but the book did not go into much detail that was not already widely available."
5,Good for a good chuckle!,"If you like Bloopers , SNAFU's and TOFU than you are at the right place. My Family got quite a few laughs out of this DVD and think it is well worth the coin. Enjoy!"
4,"Not so ""Salty""","Not as ""salty"" as advertised. Some TV shows on Fox network have more ""saltiness."" Bloopers are funny, but not as funny as I expected."
3,hmmm,"this is one of those albums that you respect for being musically good but don't really enjoy listening to. My main beef with this album is the singer, who's nasally nerd drawl is like nails on a chalk board. Otherwise I guess I do enjoy (partially) the other insturments on this, but the flaws with the singer just brings down the whole band."
4,Who cares if they sound like the Beatles...This is Good!,"It seems that if a band today sounds like another band they can be dismissed. This is a philosophy for elitists and shut-ins! This album is good. Sure they are emulating the Beatles and the Beach Boys, but it is quite obvious as the lyrics are at times and self-mocking in acknowledgment. This album has a lot more than borrowed styles. The melodies are catchy, along with the lyrics. Despite its almost simultaneous recording with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Down With Wilco is quite different. Some of the songs recall each other, but that is because they are very good songs.What is fun about this album is that at times it is a bit ridiculous but quite catchy. Its quirkiness is resilient and keeps you coming back for more to grasp and relive those awkward moments. This album good, buy now.."
4,Fun and Addictive,"This album didn't give it all up on the first few listens. I got if about six months ago (on the same day I bought Wilco's A Ghost is Born, which I am pretty disapointed in overall), and as often happens with some of my favorite albums, it wasn't until later that I popped it in and couldn't take it out of the CD player. Just listening to it once or twice is not enough to ""get it."" Fun lyrics trapped in sad songs, and sad lyrics wrapped in poppy gems.Not for those that want an easy listen."
3,Down With Wilco Indeed.,"I'll admit to being a Minus 5 fan. I'll also admit to not liking Wilco very much. I find this record to be a serious letdown after the bubbly ""Let the War Against Music Begin."" The Wilco influence is felt here. The drunken bright pop of ""War"" has been replaced with dense, ponderous material. The whole record is dark and sedate, and not in a good way. There are very few joyous moments on this disc. There are a few good tunes (""The Town That Lost it's Groove Supply,"" ""View From Below"" and ""I'm Not Bitter"" stand out). The whole record sounds more like a later Wilco record than a Minus 5 effort. Which, in my opinion is a bad thing."
1,Not What I Was Expecting,"I love Wilco, from Summerteeth to YHF. So I was naturally drawn to purchase this CD. It is, unfortunately, a bust. I suggest giving it a pass. The tunes are boring, and they wander aimlessly. There are too many changes of tempo and fatuous lyrics. If Wilco is in here somewhere ,they cannot be heard. What a disappointment!"
4,amazing poet -- limited edition,"McKay's poetry is brilliant. Sadly, this thrift edition does not do justice to the poet or his work. I look forward to finding a definitive edition of all his poems. Many of his poems, such as ""If we must die"", are revolutionary. This poem uses a traditional form subversively, conveying a powerful and radical meaning. McKay, in a time when the ultimate taboo is a black man's use of violence against the white institution or individual, contemplates the use of black violent power to obtain what the African-American does not have in America -- equality, justice, etc. The fight may lead to death, but it is a death with dignity.This is just one example of McKay's great poetry. Read it, whether in this edition or another. His poems add great texture, not only to the Harlem Renaissance, but to African-American culture on a whole."
3,predictable but I liked it.,"I found TB to be alittle weaker than he should have been for a starring role. I really enjoyed Cloris Leachman's portrayal of the handicapped neighbor. But my favorite in the movie was Michael Beck's nasty bad guy with a wonderful Brit/Irish accent, He put the edge on everything, and with his leather jacket and snakeskin boots-he made watching it worthwhile. Heather Locklear is sure enough pretty in this, and when she makes her transformation, makes you look twice. And the police are steriotypically the ones that ""don't get it"". This is a great Sunday afternoon matinae popcorn movie."
2,Good cable - not CL2 rated,I purchased this cable along with other Monster cables from the Flat Screen series because Monster told me that the cable was CL2 rated for in-wall installation. After receiving the cable I found that it was not CL2 rated and could not be run inside of the wall. All of Monster's other cables in the Flat Screen series are CL2 rated. The picture quality was fine but Monster should have made this cable CL2 rated like the other cables in the Flat Screen series.
5,Great for New Christians from 12-18,I recently purchased three copies of this book for some youthin my Sunday School class who recently accepted Christ. I found thatit covered all of the questions they had and still was on their level! His wit made it very easy for them to learn and urged them to dig in the Bible for answers. It can also be easily adapted for Bible studies with any size group!
3,Can I Be A Christian Without Being Weird?,I've tried this one as a lesson guide for a teen Sunday school class and have found that it is lacking for that purpose. I think this book would be great for the individual to read instead.
4,A Good Book but Dated,"Ricciotti's book on Julian was first published in the 1950s. For decades it has only been available used. While readable and making no major errors in fact, he has been superceded by more modern works. You will find it an interesting read and will get value for your money. Julian is one of the fascinating characters of late Roman history and the one whom we know the most about, not only from several major sources but also from the Emperor's own surviving writings. Julian, a fascinating character, is worth anyone's time to investigate."
3,Too Small,This watch is very cute. It is described as being a petite watch but that is a polite word for saying it is a children's watch. I am not sure why Nike chose to make such a small band width. Even if you are very petite you might want to try to find this in a store to try on before ordering online.
5,AWESOME JEWELRY BOX,"My daughter just loves this jewelry box. So much so, that we might order another one for her to use when she returns to colleget in the fall!!! Her grandmother thinks the box is beautiful. The quality and price are on point. Thank you very much."
3,Needs more glue,i got it today and is ok the back part is falling off but nothing superglue cant fix the box itself is pretty
3,MUCH smaller than it appears,"Ordered this for my daughter as a consolidated jewelry box. However, it is MUCH smaller than I'd anticipated based off the pictures. It might be a reasonable small travel case for multiple peices of jewelry for a long trip, but not if your intent is to keep any signficant collection in one place.It was however, delivered faster than expected."
2,Not so Huge,It is not huge! It is so small that my daughter can't fit her toy jewelery in it. It is a toy.
4,Great item!,"I purchased the tan colored jewelry box. It's pretty big and it fit mostly all my necklaces. There's a space for rings also, but not for bulky rings.It doesn't really have space for earrings. it does have a designated space, but only for small stud earrings. Not hanging earrings of any kind.It still helped me put a lot or things away.If you have a lot of necklaces, then this is a great product!Sturdy."
4,Alt Country the way you like it......,"This CD has not made much of a splash around here. Apparently KLOW records does not have much of a publicicty department. However, it is well deserving of a place within the collection of anyone who listens to the likes of Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, Doug Sahm, Uncle Tupelo or any of their spinoff groups. The title track asks the questions :What's God got against rednecks? How come tornadoes love trailer parks? - A question I've certainly asked myself in the past. Ballads, all out rockers (Burnin' Down), country crooners - there's something for any alt country fan on this CD. Curtis Burch (Newgrass Revival) adds tasty dobro and slide throughout. Skip Bethune's vocals come across with just the right touch of flat Appalachian inflection. Well befitting a bunch of twangers from Lexington, Ky. Repeated listening is highly recommended and well rewarded."
3,Must have if you want an cd changer,I very disappointed with sony corporation becacause since this is an must have to run a cd changer. It should automatically be sold with the sony cd changer.
1,"Defective item, defective tech support",This item works fine as a small portable radio but myself and many others who bought this item found that the flash memory was defective. Unfortunately the store I bought it from will no longer accept it for return and Cowon's tech support is non-existant. I would recommend you shop for a different audio player.
5,da Birds,"These refill attachments keep your daBird in working order. My cats love the new ""birds"" better than the old one. They are always ""going crazy"" when I bring out the toy every night. It just appears they ""go crazier"" when I put the new bird on the toy."
4,Cats and Dogs Love them,"Our dogs love this toy so does the cat. They ring the bell hanging on the door then go to the kitchen and look up at the refrigerator, where I keep Da Bird, because they want to play."
5,Birds of a feather...,"Flock together and hang out on the end of a Da Bird Fishin' Pole!!! These were great replacement feathers for our cat's beloved fishin' pole. They are exactly like the original products feathers-no difference in size, number or length. All three feathers were present and accounted for and arrived in separate packages so you can store two unopened until you need them. We are quite pleased with these replacements (as were my fishin' felines...)and hope they will be around for re-order if we should need to replace them again!!! What a great product-- these feathers really spin and make the distinctive sound that true Da Bird lovin'cats have come to appreciate and enjoy!!!"
3,So small!,I'm disappointed. The refill is 2 inch shorter and 1 inch narrower than the original feathers came with the pole that I bought on Amazon. The only reason I bought this is because the original one was torn. But the new refill I received is exactly look like the torn one we have. Imagine that! why do i need these anyway?
5,Perfect refills,"These refills were great, even though they are slightly smaller than the first feathers that came with our Da Bird. The size isn't a detriment at all and they flutter just as the original did."
3,"Decent, but too short","This is a pretty good video, but the preaching section is too short. I like the interview at the end, it provides a little bit of insight into Campolo's preaching. All in all I wish the video were longer, so I could have gained more information."
5,Fitchburg Street,"From Fitchburg Street to the fraternity houses at UT and out into the universal music scene, Doyle Bramhall has taken us on a musical blues odyssey that continues to this day. Powerful album-anything that Doyle produces is a must for music junkies. Buy it."
4,Bramhall of Fame,"Note to DeepBlueReview: I believe (Doyle) Bramhall ll , who recorded ""Jellycream"" and played with Double Trouble in The Arc Angels is actually the son of this texas singer/drummer, Doyle Bramhall.This LP sounded good to me. I love the standards, and I think he hits high notes on all these covers, plus his own classic. His son is a fine GTR player in backing band as well.If anyone ever gets a chance to see Bramhall II on Austin City Limits, their version of ""Shape I'm In"" that opens up the show, is about as good a song as this Blues Fan has ever heard."
4,Quick Healthy Meals,"This is a great cookbook for working moms - the meals are very healthy and most of them can be whipped up in a half an hour or less. Some of the recipes, however, come out quite bland, which is why I gave the book 4 stars. Through trial and error I have learned which recipes need an extra 'boost' - although most recipes are really quite good. It's nice to be able to put healthy meals on the table, that is important to me and why I love this cookbook."
1,Shockingly unhealthy!,"The chili recipe in this cookbook has just five ingredients in it, three are canned, one processed (pasta) and the other meat. Total sodium based on the labels on the cans I used were: tomato soup 30% of the recommended daily adult intake, beans 16%, broth 58% - total sodium from these three ingredients per serving: 104%. Canned, processed, overly salty, nothing healthy about that! They should have called this book, More of the Same Old Betty Crocker (owned by General Mills)."
2,Disappointing sequel to Aegypt reveals insufficiency of magi,"I loved Crowley's Aegypt, a wonderful compound of life, art, and magic (specifically hermeticism.) Although written in Crowley's beautiful style this novel was a severe disappointment. The lyrical life-affirming optimism of the preceding novel was wholly absent, replaced by a dismal elegaic pessimism. The book's structure is kind of clumsy too - it's a loosely related set of chunks of stories which while interesting in themselves don't flow well together. It's interesting to speculate that the novel's grim tone is related to the murder of Crowley's friend and professor of hermetic studies Ioan Culianu, who was assassinated, evidentally for political reasons, in 1991. Giordano Bruno, the Renaissance hermeticist, is a principal subject of Crowley's novel and his life bears parallels to Culianu's."
3,Don't let the cover fool you!,"You would think this spoke about the brothers equally. However, this is 95% about William and 5% about Harry. Sometimes it's very critical of Harry, but it's almost always gushy about William. Yes, it's William that is killer hot, but why throw salt on a wound? I'm sure Harry doesn't want the second-rate coverage. This work answers a lot of questions, but it is also quite gushy. It could be monarchist propaganda because its message is, ""William is so wonderful in looks, height, behavior, and taste in women. So be excited that he'll be King one day!"" I am an African-American male and when they showed William DJ'ing for a radio show and he said, ""Big ups to so-and-so!"", I almost fell out of my chair. You know the world must love them some African-American slang when even British royalty are using it."
4,New information on the tribulation period,"I read the galley proofs on this book and was impressed by the information and knowledge brought forth by this book. I have been close to the author and have watched the progress of the book over twenty years. It is really worth reading and would provide a great comfort to the loved ones of those who don't choose Christ before the Rapture of the Church. In the days when the Bible itself may be banned, this book would provide at the least, an overview of the events the Bible tells will happen to those left behind. The reason I didn't give it a five is because I would have liked more information, but the writer told me that the size of the book was intentional because of the nature of a handbook. If purchased now and read along with the Bible, it should be a valuable book in the coming days and years."
5,It's been a hit with all three of our girls!,"Samantha loses her sweet tooth has been loved by all three of our girls. They love to try to remember the story page to page. Something about kids not liking vegies, lots of sweet treats and teeth falling out makes this our family favorite! I am so glad I picked this book up at Rainbow Foods years ago...never thought it would be such a hit. Thought this book deserved at least one review!! Thanks Samantha for years of joy!"
3,missing 25% of their hits,"this band had 4 UK hits:* ""(And The) Pictures in the Sky"" - Number 22 - 1971* ""One and One is One"" - Number 3 - 1973* ""Rising Sun"" - Number 11 - 1973* ""Slip and Slide"" - Number 22 - 1974this ""best of"" compilation doesn't have ""Pictures in the Sky""."
1,Disapointed,I think the pendant is absolutely beautiful but I also agree that is does not sit properly on the neck because of the large back on it for the chain. If that was made smaller it would look better. Unfortunate that a simple design flaw can ruin the entire thing.
2,Not happy...,"I bought this charm for myself cause it's my birthstone but when I recieved it I was not happy with the way it is made. It doesn't sit flat on your chest, no matter what chain you put it on. It's very small and I don't think the color is very good. I NEVER wear it!"
1,Poor Quality!,"The loop that connects this pendant to the chain is so big that the pendant will not lay flat, it keeps flipping over. I took it to a jeweler who said they had never seen anything crafted with such a poor design! Such a beautiful necklace, it was to match earrings I gave to my sister. Now they won't even take it back because it was a Christmas gift, but I bought it so early that I wasn't able to return it within the 30 days required. What a HUGE waste of money!"
4,Celtic Knot and Topaz Pendant,"This pendant is well made and is large enough that is shows up well when worn. I do think a more delicate, thinner chain would be better with this pendant. In fact, I switched out the chain with one from another necklace. I bought this as part of the set with the bracelet and earrings. It is a nice gift for yourself or others."
2,The charm is beautiful but won't lie flat....,"This charm is meant for some other application---it does not work on th chain it comes with....but it is beautiful. If I find out HOW it can be used, I'll update my review. Some people have suggested it's a belly button ring charm, a pearl enhancer---but I don't know how it would clip on or a charm for a torque."
4,Estleman's my tour guide/historian,My mother was in high school just outside of Detroit during the war years and I've heard her stories often. I enjoyed Estleman telling me more about what was going on there when she was young.
3,THE MOTOR CITY AS STAGE & NARRATIVE DURING WORLD WAR II,"Detroit, as prime representative of ""the Arsenal of Democracy"" in the late spring of 1943, is moving at a fevered pitch in meeting the needs of the war effort. Crime doesn't take a holiday, however, as the local police force, with limited resources, is on a trail of a schizophrenic serial killer masquerading in a U.S. Army Air Forces uniform. At the same time, racial tensions are simmering just below the surface.Estleman, as in his previous ""Detroit Crime Mystery Series"" novels, provides a variety of rich, well-defined characters who give the reader a palpable sense of what Detroit was like during the Second World War. The city offers itself here as both stage and narrative."
3,Worth a Read,"I only gave this book three stars because it is not really the type of story that turns me on, but I do recommend it for fans of historically accurate, gritty police and action novels. Estleman really knows how to capture the mood and feeling of a time period. His war-time Detroit seems dead-on, and as a resident I enjoyed the references to streets and places in the city. The novel was also informative - I hadn't known that there was a race riot during the war years, and the information about the war effort at the auto plants was fascinating.My main criticism would be the characters of the cops. They didn't stand out as individual personalities, and I didn't get involved with them as I do with Elmore Leonard's novels. However, fans of Leonard could do worse than reading ""Jitterbug"" and other Estleman novels."
5,Can't take this one out of my CD Player,"This CD is a Masterpiece of Black Metal, every song is full of thick emotion and dark atmosphere. Should have been named ""Sons of Dark Desire"". If you enjoy Heavy Metal of any kind you will love this CD, you will not be disappointed.This is the only CD I have put in my CD player in my car and listened to it over and over again for weeks."
5,"Classic Black Metal that hails from the founding state itself, Norway","Excellent excellent excellent, that is all that can truly describe this album or this band in general. Some say that it all sounds the same, well perhaps if they would just turn down their greenday and listen to the real stuff they would gte a better picture of what these ""heathens"" are really trying to say.Point is, if you enjoy crazy riffs, crazy double-bass pedels, and vocals that could force mud to give birth to a pig, then this is for you."
5,GREAT!!!!!,"This album is great! My second favorite of all time!!! For black metal, this album is very catchy and i can sense some power metal influences. Some dont like it because it doesnt sound like Immortals previous works. Change is a good thing, especially in this case."
4,Never was a big fan of 'dark metal' but this is intense and great to listen to,"I bought this CD after seeing Immortal on YouTube and heard the song ""Sons of Northern Darkness"" I liked the song enough to buy this CD. I later bought ""Damned in Black"" they are both good. Fantastic is the fast double bass on Sons of Northern Darkness! Whoa does it get exciting!The music is abrasive though, but fun.I never was very into dark metal but this band Immortal are great. The songs are innovative they have their own style. Of course there are thrash metal influences. But this band does not sound like some predictable dark metal band. No superficial lyrics. A must buy for metal fans and dark metal alike."
5,Immortal !!!,"Well this cd is my one of my favorites of this band with ""Battles In The North"". A different Immortal born since Demonaz had to leave the band and Abbath took the guitar, that change slower their sound like a 100% they also change their logo.This new Immortal somehow create amazing music totally different to their also so good past albums with Demonaz. All the tracks are perfect and I enjoy this CD from the first song to the last one. If you like this sound get ""Dammed in black"" that is similar, or ""At the heart of winter"". If you want something more brutal and faster then get their old stuff with Demonaz in guitars."
5,Anthemic melodic black metal,"Immortal perfects their melodic death/black metal sound with this release, with some of their most memorable, almost groovy songs. They build on the cold, majestic melodies of their last two releases with a nod to the old minimalist days on the title track and ""One By One"". They take more technical, death-metal oriented sound on ""Demonium"" and a fist-pumping catchy thrash sound on ""In My Kingdom Cold"". The slow dirge of ""Tyrants"" and the final epic ""Beyond The North Waves"" make this Immortal's most diverse album. This is their best album since Pure Holocaust."
5,Good cd to learn code with,"This CS is a no nonsense guide to learning code. It jumps right on in and starts. the narration gets to you so I would only recommend short lessons with frequency. Otherwise, you do really seem to pick up the code fairly easily."
2,I can't stand this guy's voice.,"I'd really like to learn CW, so I turned to this trusted and well reviewed CD set. The system used seems like it should work well (repetition and regular refreshers) , but I can't even get through five minutes of the program. The narrator, a ham himself, sounds like he's either sick when this was recorded, or has a naturally heavy nasally voice. Either way, it drives me nuts, and has made the discs unlistenable for me. I'll probably give them away to the next ham I meet who shows interest in CW.EDIT: I've since gotten a copy of the Gordon West W5YI ""The Code Teacher"" tape series (which I believe is now called""0-5 WPM Morse Code Course""), and wow does it blow the ARRL's ""Your Introduction to Morse Code"" out of the water. WB6NOA is much more pleasant to listen to, and the exercises are more diverse and entertaining. Plus, the narrator actually makes it fun. I hate to sound so negative, but skip the ARRL's course and head for W5YI."
4,"Used this to learn ""flashing light""","I find it funny that radio operators don't have to test at Morse Code but ship operators still do when we have at least 6 other ways to communicate on our bridge. Anyway, I used this program to learn the code for my flashing light test and it worked great for me. As the tones were played, I wrote the dits and dahs on paper and visualized the light. Then at test time I copied the flashes onto paper and had no trouble with knowing the letters. I'll continue to use this product whenever I need to refresh for my license upgrades."
2,Kinda cheap and nasty,"I purchased this for my son's class diorama and he ended up making one out of clay since this looked so fake and dated. We used it as a mold, so it served some purpose. The stance is all wrong and the pieces don't stay together AT all. It has to be glued and painted (for some reason I thought the paint would be included here) in order to look at all right... maybe useful for historical perspective. This is what T-Rex's were thought to look like 50 years ago."
2,this wasnt confessions,"this book did not contain confessions, rather if had stories that most of us have heard dozens of times. I was very disappointed with it."
3,Serious items of 20th Cent,"I surpsed myself and finished thisbook as I was going to stop on severalocassions. His vinettes of imprtanthistory(the Russian civil war,the Chicagoconvention,the Unamerican Committee) wereincredible. I take issue with the extentof his family history which was confusingand tiring."
5,Peavey Diaphragm,"Excellent ..Does what it says on the tin as it where..Erm, funnily enough the RX22 is a perfect replacement for a broken RX22..I hope this review was helpfull.."
5,Miss Fargo at her best!,"What a pleasure it is to finally have these gems on CD. These 2 cd showcase Donna's versatility. You have a little Country, some Pop and Gospel. ""Just for you"" is my all time favorite of Donna's cd's. These song sound as fresh today as they did back in the 70's. All of Donna's fans should add this one to your collection!"
3,"Wonderful music selection, but poor recording quality","The concerti on this album represent some of the most beautiful and transportive string music the world has ever seen. I love the selection of Lalo, Saint-Saens, and Faure all in one place.The performance is alright, but a tad lifeless in places--which is not a good thing for such passionate music.The quality of the recording is poor. This may well be due to the fact that it was made back in 1991. I'm not sure. This is something that probably won't bother a lot of listeners--but if you have audiophile-grade equipment you will be bothered by it.Music selection = 5 stars, performance = 3.5 stars, recording quality = 1 star, for an average of 3 stars."
4,Fun Vocabulary Builder,"I'm a teacher and bought this book as a gift to a 4-year-old daughter of a friend. We sat down and read it together and (as young children do) she immediately grabbed a handful of markers to color in it - but that's okay to do with this book! I watched her color as she learned the Latin vocabulary for colors and simple sentences. Her dad learned right along with us! This book (and others in the ""I Am Reading Latin"" series) are perfect for any age and fun to read at home or to be used as part of a lesson in school. There is an easy reference in the back that glosses vocabulary."
3,"OK Product, However, the Blue one is the Best","This product is small to reflect Yoda's size. It does not have the flash, color, vibration and overall effect the ObiWan saber has. Buy the ObiWan. You will be much more pleased as will your child."
1,Really bad tubes,"Tubes were inflated to 40 psi and deflated before installation to make sure there were no leaks. It was installed on a fairly new Aeromax Alloy Wheelset with new Michelin Krylion Carbon Tires (700 x 23 - Black/Grey). After installation was completed, the wheels were inflated to 70 psi and bounced around to spread the air and expand the tubes evenly. It was deflated and inflated before completing the installation to 100 psi. I checked for any imperfections before taking it for a ride.The first tube: After half a mile into riding on clean pavement, the rear wheel lost air. A clean straight 3mm rip parallel to the wheels in the dead center of the tube.The second tube: A week later, the front wheel lost air after riding through uneven pavement (not a pothole, just uneven pavement). A small uneven 2mm pinch flat. (Total mileage on tube was less than 5 miles).Worst $16.00 spent on 2 tubes and no way to return them..."
2,"Superficial, weak and boring","Tells me very little about the man. I knew very little about Crowley before reading this book, I know even less for having done so.The title of the book perhaps should have clued us in to the omission of any analysis or explanation of Crowley's mystical beliefs. It's probable that the intention was to present Crowley 'the man'. The problem being that this makes for only slightly more interesting reading than discussing Pete Sampras without discussing tennisThe author seems to regard Crowley as such a thorough fraud, that he does not even bother to debunk most of Crowley's tales and instead ignores them completely.This is only an 'autobiography' in the loosest terms. He was born, he lied, he died."
1,The Beast Demystified is Depressing Tripe!,"This isn't a book, it's a book report- slapped together by an obsequious, schoolboy, establishment, apple polisher. It is an appalling effort that reveals more about the sad state of current U.K. publishing than it does about its subject matter.It is increasingly depressing to find more and more of these books stocking the shelves at such break neck pace. Truly,it is apparent, ""no bad book shall go unpublished"". And no more truer, when it happens to be a dreadful, pious and nauseatingly moralistic account of the late great Master Therion (Aleister Crowley).Where are we as a culture if all we have to offer as insight into our more stellar and grandiose lives than the type of unimaginative, establishment propaganda and pablum as concocted here? Phooey!This is a childish, hateful and pedestrian look at one of the towering iconoclasts and mystics of the Twentieth Century."
4,Best Book About Comic Book Guy EVER,"You love the Simpsons!You love Comic Book Guy!And, well, to gain the best possible enjoyment of this book, you also love, or at least have a passing knowledge of, movies, science-fiction, pro wrestling (Rob Van Dam in ECW makes a cameo!), comics, video games, Dungeons & Dragons, and just general geek culture. And if you do, you'll LOVE this book. Sure, it seems to be the same gags just updated every few pages... but what are you expecting, Pride and Prejudice?It's an illustrated book, it has Simpsons-esque humor, and it's an enjoyable read. Highly recommended."
2,ehh,not worth the buy... its ok. but it makes my hair greasy i dont see any glass affect. just makes it gross def disapointed in the brand for this. i have used garnier products that work better.
5,Great for Type-B Hair,"I gave these drops a try on the advice of my beautician and didn't expect much...OMG!! I was soo wrong. It has made my curls shiny and when used with PM sculpting foam...terrific. I used to use a leave in conditioner, a gel (max hold)-Aussie and a sprunch spray-Aussie simultaneously to try and hold these curls in place. If you have my hair type, you know what I mean. What a relief to have these drops. My hair is shiny but not greasy...Sorry I got so long winded...I'm just excited!!"
2,A little goes a LONG way!,"Paul Mitchell Gloss Drops give an extra shine boost to your hair and they smell great, but there's a big problem with this product. Gloss Drops weighs down fine hair with a greasy coating and ruins a potentially good look. Even without fine hair, any more than 1 - 2 drops of this product can weigh your hair and make it extremely oily even if you have naturally dry hair. With Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Oil (another Paul Mitchell product) on the market, Gloss Drops isn't really worth your time, unless you have extremely thick long or coarse hair."
3,Moom - 'Bone Idol' (Delerium),"First heard of this British indie 'jam rock' five piece on the Delerium 2-CD various artists 'Pick & Mix' release. Tunes here I sort of thought were pretty decent are the airy ""Gideon's Pier"", the free wheeling (like) ""Rooftops"", ""I, Structure"" and ""Non-Specific Highway"". Line-up: Kristian Hartridge-guitar & vocals, Mark Astill-guitar, Andy Fairclough-keyboards, Jim Patterson-bass and Greg Myles-drums & vocals. Fans of the Grateful Dead, Psychedelic Breakfast and possibly Phish will eat this material up!"
1,item does not look product displayed,"I was really excited for these coasters, but they look as if they were spray painted pink. The Celtic Knot is a cool design, but the spray paint makes them look really cheap. The picture in the product description looks natural, if that is what you want stay away from these."
3,Celtic Knot Thirstystone Coasters,These coasters work well but the design is totally not as pictured. The picture looks natural whereas the ones I received seem to be painted on. I feel a bit cheated.
5,Thirsty stones,I received a set of thirstystones as a gift once and decided I needed more. I love the design and these are exactly what I wanted.
3,"Too thick, and kinda ugly",These coasters are nearly half an inch thick... so you have to be really careful not to let the class perch on the edge. I feel as if the glass is sitting on a cliff waiting to fall.They do absorb the drips and they don't seem to stain (red wine!) easily.
3,Donna,"This was a very interesting book it was a little hard to follow but the characters are well written. I would recommend this book, just be true to give it your full attention, because you will not understand it if you don't."
3,"like the first one, it's mediocre","In this book, more warriors are sent from earth to nayve, including jubal. Natac gains another ally, of whom is a dragon named regillix. Sirien's sister, janitha, also joins to fight. Another good but in some ways, bad book. Like the first, there are some sexuality that is described in a little too much clarity. It was boring at some parts too. Still another okay read. Recommended."
3,Nearly foolproof projects,"This is a pretty good video for anyone needing ideas for craft projects, ideas that pertain to different cultures (only three, however). The construction techniques are easy to follow, both verbally and visually, and the results are colorful, invite variation, and are easy to achieve. In addition, you'll probably think up related ideas on your own. However, it's only about craft-work and not a true discussion or explanation of multicultural arts. I think it would be more helpful in a classroom if the cultures mentioned can be explored and expanded upon by students in another capacity besides ""art."""
2,Waste of time.,This movie was long and drawn out with horrible acting. Was really surprised by the good reviews when I watched it.
3,Different type of movie with some good laughs,"Most filmmakers bill their film as being unique and typically most arent even close however this film is something different in a good way. Boys and Girls Guide is set up just like the title says as almost a ""how to"" or guide on how to get down in LA. Some of the jokes are universal to partying and some are specific to the area.Production vaule is decent for a straight to video feature. If you are expecting the production vaule of a studio movie you wont get it here. Indie film fans that ""get"" these types of movies will love it."
4,"Young Immature Sexual Drug Humor, but not bad","A few laughs throughout wITH some good looking girls, especially Leyla from the game show ""Deal or No Deal."" buy it used-not worth buying new. similar toMating Habits of the Earthbound Humans(with Carmen Electra) in terms of documentary-style humorous narration."
2,Easy to Watch but NOT funny.....,"observational take on dating, sex, etc. Choppy ""plot"" meanders about aimlessly looking for opportunities to create funny ""skits"". Fails miserably. I want those 2 hours of my life back."
5,Possibly the best modern Party Movie of All-Time,"I'm a total film nut and have seen just about every movie out there. I saw The Boys & Girls Guide to Getting Down several months ago at a special screening in Hollywood...It totally blew me away. Raw, hillarious, true to the lifestyle. One of the best party films ever. Brilliantly directed and shot, some great unknown actors, and a clever narration vehicle to move the story forward at an upbeat pace. It's like I was watching a collection of the funniest stories from my nightlife experiences in LA. And honestly, for those green newbies to the LA scene...Very informative. Almost educational. You will probably never see this film in a major theatre, but great gem for the personal DVD collection. I'm def putting it on in the background next time we have a rager.As an indie filmmaker myself, this is the kind of film that keeps me inspired.Glad you guys finally got this bad boy to DVD.Good Luck with the Film."
3,okay,"The rubber o-rings dry out and fall off in after a couple months, and the seal starts leaking after about a year of use. Other than those issues, it's a very nice oil cap that looks good. I'm sure you can buy an o-ring kit if you want to keep the o-rings on it. Can probably even buy different colors. I have the matching air breather, radiator cap, and power steering cap. All of them have the same issue with the o-rings drying and falling off."
4,PROBABLY BETTER THAN I THINK?,"[SORRY, I HAD TO LAUGH AT THE PUBL. DATE - 1901??? ]Twins Times Two! is a beautiful story of the confusion one of each set of twins being mixed up --Cara Wells could not believe her eyes when she get a look at her clients' set of twins. They were the exact mirror of her own twins.Here is the dilemma of each parent not wanting to give up the other twin -- the only answer is a marriage of convenience?Ross Gifford lives in a fairy-tale castle [in Utah?] with his three year old toddlers but is unwilling to go through the pain of losing love again and will give Cara anything but his heart.Cara had gotten rid of one controlling manipulator, would she be saddled with another? Or could she teach Ross the wonder of loving again even if it is just for their little girls?Actually gave it a 4 plus rating in my library but would have like a little stronger tension -- all in all a very good story and it goes without saying that I loved the epilogue."
3,Good Reference,"This is a very thorough book, although Rupley's manual of avian practice is a more practical and up to date reference for the clinician. Altman's book is a little vague in the pathology and sometimes too general for a book that should be an all-encompassing reference."
3,this deck is da bomb! by James *,"This is a very good deck. It comes with a Cradily that is very powerful. it can do 50+ damage in one attack. It also comes with a Lileep(to evolve into Cradily). The Lileep is quite powerful by itslef. If you want to buy this deck, I would not buy it here. You can get better prices at [...]. Remember, these cards are not that durable. Take care of them and they will be fine, but treat them wrong and they will be destroyed. One last thing. All Salamences are called Bohandars!"
2,Cheap construction,These gloves lasted all of about 1 hour before they tore. They didn't fit well either on either hand. I wouldn't recommend these gloves.
4,A Comprehensive Review,"Westphal does a really nice job with Become a Self. He literally retells Concluding Unscientifc Postscript in late-20th century terms, including several contemporary thinkers of the continental tradition. Westphal attempts to better clarify what Kierkegaard as Climacus means between ""being"" and ""becoming."" I recommmend this book highly for anyone that studies Kierkegaard or desire to read Concluding Unscientific Postscript without reading Conclusing Unscientific Postscript."
5,A excellent source.,I think that Fantasy Islands is a great source for the international bridebusiness for I Agree with the book and other sources 100% that the international Marrages work out much better then our domestic Marriagesanytime.
3,needs updating,"a good starter book for those who are looking to get into club repair or refurbishing the old wood drivers. Most of the material is a little dated and doesn't cover alot of the new stuff and technology, but it provides a good base for most club repair."
5,Fab year round gift,"Now here's holiday music that's enchanting, fun and lively without driving you nuts. I can listen to this year around and have it in a CD slot that I don't seem to want to remove."
3,This book sure could have used an editor.,"There is no doubt that Gary Shelton knows a lot about bears and remaining safe in bear country. For reasons unknown, he chose to publish this book himself and as a result, it is amateurish in many respects. The most glaring example of this is the fact that after the book was finished, a horrific attack took place in British Columbia. Shelton learned the details of this attack and tacked a chapter about it on to the end of the book after the conclusion. No editor worth his salt would have allowed this book to hit the shelves this way. There was no good reason not to have incorporated this chapter into the body of the book.Also, Shelton comes off as being somewhat desperate to be recognized as an authority on this subject. Okay...............Whatever. The book is worth the money and the time."
1,Sleazy knock-off of Stephen Herrero's classic Bear Attacks,"There's no question Shelton has a lot of experience with bears, and his provocative thoughts on bear/human relations make this book well worth reading . . . nevertheless, I'm skeptical about the accuracy of some bear tales he reports: p.121-122, a hunter startles a female girzzly with three cubs ""70 feet away."" According to the hunter, the ""sow rose upright onto her hind legs . . .all four bears ran uphill straight towards me . . . the she-bear, still on her hind legs, passed the cubs in the process . . . until she was three feet away.""When pigs fly. Cubs on all fours would run at least 20 mph. A mature female on her hind legs couldn't cover 4 miles a year. This kind of nonsense and drivel hurts Shelton's credibility."
3,For beginners or elementary student class,"It is what it is. Quality is decent for a poster, but pricey for what it is. After seeing it I'd pass. I ordered because I'm an adult music beginner and somehow having things in front of me daily causes them to sink in over time (hey it's just me).Really a classroom item."
4,This book is exactly what it says it is.,"It contains great pictures and sometimes exhaustive details about the making of this feature film. From the concept of the movie to post production work, you get an inside look at all of the planning and hard work involved in getting this film into theaters. If you are interested in the steps involved in movie-making and the X-files in general then this book is for you. It gave me a better appreciation for the movie."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this item at a big chain electronics store. I set it up and started playing a brand new cd. I tried to skip a track...it wouldn't go to the next track. In fact it looked as if it were cycling through all tracks and the interface just froze up. Oh, I didn't mention that if you increase the volume past a certain point, the thing just quits working. Maybe I had a defective unit, but I wound up taking the thing back within an hour of buying it. I purchased a slightly more expensive Sony stereo and so far it works great....even when I cranked it up!Do yourself a favor, please avoid this product like the plague or you will be disappointed."
2,CD Player Not Reliable,"I always had problems with the CD changer but, I stillcontinued to use it and worked my way around the oddities.I burnt out a circuit about 4 wks ago. Unable to get itrepaired until 12/27. I left 2 cds in the cd track andI can't get the CD player to work now that the breakerhas been repaired. WARNING:NEVER LEAVE YOUR CDSIN THE CD PLAYER AT ANY TIME AS THEY MAY GETSTUCK IN THE CHANGER LIKE MINE. You can't pullthem out manually. It could be lack of my knowinghow to do so but, be aware."
1,it wasnt that good,the detail of the little things took away from the main story line and could be confusing for younger readers.
5,Uplifting!,I've always been a fan of guitar music with a tenor voice. Devon Gundry's settings of the Baha'i Sacred Writings are respectful and yet innovative. There are many recordings out there of the texts set with a slow tempo and often in a minor key. These are more upbeat and still manage to be reverent at the same time. Outstanding. I love it.
1,Not compatible with Nokia 3650,I bought the 3com USB Bluetooth adapter to syncronize my desktop calendar and contacts with my Nokia 3650. The adapter is not compatible with Nokia PC suite which is necessary to be able to synchronize calendar and contacts. I would not recommend it.
4,A 50's noir mystery full of twists,"George Axelrod wrote the screenplays for Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Manchurian Candidate. Here he takes on the classic noir story of a New York publisher who is offered the manuscript of the century--the last novel of a Hemingway-like novelist. But complications soon arise--there may be more than one manuscript, a shady agent becomes involved, and a beautiful woman reenters the publisher's life. There are a lot of twists and turns in this story, some more believable than others, but it unfolds along the pulp fiction line and wraps up nicely in the end. In sum, another winner from Hard Case Crime."
4,Interesting tunes,"I thought these tunes were intresting , with bizarre perspectives on things.A fun romp for this day and age!"
4,Nice outfit,Our child loved this costume for halloween. It is plush and quite warm and well made. Fortunately it was a cool night or I'm not sure she would have been able to last the whole night in it. The whole family dressed up a different Winne the Pooh characters. Lots of fun. She wanted to play in it everyday for awhile but we didn't allow her since we want to save it for her little cousins.
5,great teapot,"The pot is a pleasure to use. It's not too big nor too small. The design is simple and classy. The spout is well designed, the water can pour without dripping. Nor does it feel too heavy. The price is VERY reasonable for a cast iron pot. Goldilocks would be happy, it's just right.There was no noticeable flaw with my tea basket. When I first started using the pot, there was a little rust spot forming on the pot lip. So I seasoned the pot and lid - rubbing a fine coat of cooking oil on the outer cast surface and placing the pot in a cold oven and then setting it to 250F for one hour. I enjoyed coddling my little pot like that. The outer surface now has a little extra sheen and it stopped rust spots formation."
4,Great little tea pot,We got this tea pot for our wedding. We like to drink hot tea and this pot is perfect size for two. The exterior is very attractive and it keeps the tea warm for over an hour--great for leisurely sipping. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I noticed the strainer had a few loose wires--I think it will be OK but there was a minor cosmetic defect.
3,Good For Making 4 Cups Or More,Its a good tea pot and keeps the tea hot for a long time. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the mesh infuser is not deep enough. I prefer loose long leaf tea over tea bags and since I live alone I generally don't need to make more than 2 cups of tea for myself. Since the mesh is not deep enough if I put in 1-2 cups of water the water does not reach the tea leaves. So I end up making around 4 cups (or more) of tea and most of it eventually ends up in the sink. I guess shouldn't complain so much and should just buy a new deeper mesh for my tea pot :).
2,"""The odor of death in the city attracts the sellers of human organs.""","I didn't have any problem with the gore or keeping up with the story, what I did have a problem with was caring what happened and staying awake. I was wide awake and ready for some insane INFECTION/BIO-ZOMBIE - style action, but within 20 minutes I was already losing interest.I could go into the plot, but it's not important. My recommendation is to leave this gritty, slime-filled snoozer alone. If you haven't seen UZUMAKI then watch that instead. It might not be drenched in gore, but it's creepy and fun to watch."
3,it wasn't horrible,"its not going to be changing anybodys life, but there are worse ways to kill an hour and a half. a lot of similarities to cronenberg but not quite as well delivered"
4,"A Bizare, psychidelic nightmare","If you can imagine a japaneese directed by David Lynch then you have this baby. Okay special effects but excellent music that sticks in your head long after you've viewed it.Although the violence is restraint here copies of this film was siege by customs earlier this year, with a bit of luck Organ2 may come this way soon."
4,IMPRESCINDIBLE INTRODUCTION TO EGYPTIAN RELIGION,"Dr. Cerny was an important Egyptologist, known mostly from his minute and illuminating studies of Hieratic inscriptions; this time he has engaged in interpreting the religious creeds of the ancient dwellers on the Nile, mainly during the New Kingdom, which is the age he know best. The result is an important and readable introduction to the subject-matter, that no one interested in its study can overlook. For all Egyptian religion students: You must own one of this!"
3,Too Cliche,"I use to love this series but now that i have read almost every book except #6&9 I realize that the way this book is written has too many cliches. I'm not saying that I write better, I can't even finish a book! I have stopped buying the whole series. What's up with Jimena? Does this writer really know what being a homegirl is like? And what's up with punk and girliness and the same time... I know many DOTM lovers will hate me for writing this... but it's true... I'm sorry... I know I'm not the only that thinks this. I'm not saying it's bad.. it's pretty well written... but the cliches are way too much."
5,Great Book Love it!,After reading this book I was amazed. For such a long time I have wanted Serena to see the truth about her feelings for Stanton. I love the part which included Hecate(Hekate) and her whole history with Serena.Can not say to much just read!
3,It is not about world peace!,"Two emblematic figures of modernity ponder how to achieve the cause of world peace in an exchange of letters. It seems to me that world peace here is only an excuse, the intention is more about how to extend control and regimentation over the masses (which is why they focus on education). The book is of interest more from the point of view of what is symptomatically wrong with modernity (the idea that academic cults of personalities have the answers to the problems of the world or to the problems of every-day life), more than what is actually written by the authors. There is a strong element of hypocrisy to this work: atomic bomb builders are not likely to be the best pacifists, and neither are ""psychoanalysts"" who advocate subjecting ourselves to the most animalistic of our desires."
5,Vic Thrill Rules!,I have to say - I'm not sure how I even picked this album up - but it sounds like punk Guns & Roses (that is a major compliment) and I have not taken it out of my playlist in months. It's amazing - varied - and fun. Get this album.
5,Fantastic!!,"This foot file is the best I have ever used. My feet get really dry and cracked, this file along with the footlogix #3 cracked heel formula are the only things that keep them presentable. It files away the rough and dry skin like nobody's business. I didn't buy this threw Amazon, wish I had though, it was quite a bit more money at the spa I bought it from."
4,AC cover,Product as advertised fit properly. Was a lighter material than my old one. Will have to wait and see how well it stands up to the weather.
1,Flimsy,Waste of money. Flimsy useless thing. Would have been better off wrapping the a/c in a tarp using bungee cords.
1,Waste of Money,"Save the cost of this poorly fitting and badly designed, flimsey product and use a garbage bag at a fraction of the cost!"
3,Thermwell outdoor air conditioner cover,"Thinner than expected and although the smallest I could find, it was still a little large for my air conditioner. I probably would only recommend this if someone couldn't find the right size cover."
3,I'm not sure what to think...,"While reading this book I'd question myself as to why exactly I was reading it, so I'd put it down for awhile. However, I'd find myself thinking about it so I'd read it again. I'm still not sure what to think, but it held my interest. A fairly good first novel."
2,Not a Miracle!,"I love Ben Schrank's writing, and his intent. The book starts out very promising, and the reader soon becomes interested in the main character, Martin Kelly Minter, and his life. Many questions are brought up in the early chapters which we hope to learn more about later in the story. In the later chapters, however, rather than answer these questions, and tie the concepts together, Schrank leaves too many loose ends. He changes the entire story in the middle, and what started as a refreshingly real look at a young man's life, soon becomes a non-realistic rambling story. This book could have been planned a lot better, and seems like an unnecessarily elongated short story, which should have ended about 250 pages earlier than it did. I hope that in the future, Mr. Schrank can use his talented writing style to write a coherent novel that keeps the readers interest from beginning to end."
4,A nice start...,"Thoroughly entertaining first novel. I cared about the characters and what happened to them. Sometimes the teen angst got to me (and I'm 20!), but for the most part it stayed under control."
4,NetBeans - book review,"Seller was great.This book is good, not as wordy as a lot of OReilly books tend to be. I just don't like NetBeans. It's a resource hog, not anywhere near as robust, easy to use and configure as Eclipse, IMO.Before you buy an book on NetBeans check the version covered and what you are using."
2,"It's a good book, but Eclipse is a better open-source IDE","At first, I thought that this book was a good book. It covered a free open-source IDE for Java and I wanted to learn to program in Java. I met a professional Java who was going to the Sun One Conference in San Francisco and he recommended Eclipse. I tried Eclipse and I think that it's much better than NetBeans. I first started to dislike NetBeans when it used tilde characters in my pathnames, which made them unreadable. I tried Eclipse and so far I love it. I'm selling my NetBeans book."
4,The only available resource,"This book is the only available book on NetBeans I have so far found. All in all, this book is the best resource I have found on the subject. The book really helped me start developing with NetBeans. Thanks to the authors for a great work.< I read mostly the second part of the book, ""Extending NetBeans"".I wish the book could provide more examples. I found the ""English"" text somehow difficult to follow. In addition, the text does not always directly point to the examples provided.If you want to start developing with NetBeans, you should start here!"
4,"Sofar, O'Reilly books never disappointed me.","Sometimes I wish, I had all of the O'Reilly books on my shelf. ""NetBeans The Definitive Guide"" is a real asset to your bookshelf. IDE's are not that simple anymore. If you learn them by ""hacking"" you certainly do not learn the ""hidden"" features. Although I know Java well, this book helps to accomplish a development task faster. I like particular the chapters on Java Beans, Javadoc, XML, Extending NetBeans, Tuning Models. These are topics that require a book to help you."
3,It is ok!,"This toy doesn't really do anything it is a doll. I mean I has alot of cloths, but it really is for ages 5 or 6."
4,A BEAUTIFUL DOLL. A VERY INNAPROPRIATE OUTFIT,OK ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME AT ALL KNOWS THAT I LOVE DOLLS. AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME WELL KNOWS THAT I LIKE THE BRATZ DOLLS AND THAT SASHA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THAT BEING SAID I NEED TO SAY THAT THIS DOLL IS COMPLETELY INNAPROPRIATE. GRANTED SHE IS A VERY PRETTY DOLL WITH BEAUTIFUL HAIR & GORGEOUS MAKE-UP. NO ARGUMENT THERE! MY PROBLEM IS WITH HER NON-EXISTENT PANTS/SKIRT. IS SHE EVEN WEARING ANY BOTTOMS????? IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT! I AM GIVING HER A 4 BECAUSE SHE *IS* SO PRETTY & BECAUSE YOU *CAN* CHANGE HER CLOTHES. BUT COME ON MGA WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING??? I MEAN REALLY THESE CLOTHES MAKE THIS DOLL LOOK LIKE A WHORE. YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!! IF I HAD TO RATE THIS DOLL ON CLOTHING ALONE SHE WOULD BE A NEGATIVE 10!!!!!!! PUT SOME CLOTHES ON THE DOLLS! IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FREAKING HARD!!!!!!
1,"She may be a fashionista, but she's inappropriate","This doll makes me sad. Sasha is a beautiful doll, but she provides a difficult standard for adolescents to measure up to. While many 12-year olds would love to look like her, many are just beginning puberty, making it next to impossible to look like this. I don't think that Bratz dolls promote good body image for kids or teens. Not only that, but her dress is painfully short for a doll. Some of the Bratz dolls have acceptable outfits: I will not complain about the formal collection or the ""nighty-night"" collection. The formals are fine, and the pajamas are.. well... pajamas. However, this outfit is not appropriate. As an adult, I would advise parents and children to strongly consider what kind of messages they are supporting before purchasing this doll."
1,Would rate it all zeroes!!!!,"I love dolls! And I thought I would give Bratz a try. When I bought this Bratz doll I was soooo disappointed!!!!! I had saved up my allowance to buy this doll! And after all my work.. it was definitely not worth it!! I am now out to let all parents know to not let their kids buy this doll or to not buy it for them!!! Do you want to promote your children to be ""Bratz"". I THINK NOT! Terrible name, terrible doll! Their outfits are very bad. They look like prostitutes! Do you want to encourage your children to look like this? Cuz you will by buying them this doll. They also dont have noses! You can look for yourself.Buy a My Scene doll! I bought one after my experience and it was sooo fun! I love My Scene now. They are really beautiful. And they actually have noses! Their outfits are perfect for me and my little sister to play with. Buy one today! All children should have a My Scene doll. NOT A BRATZ!"
3,simple and straightforward to a bad end,"I liked the first 2/3's of this novel as well as the others in the series, but it is such a challenge for historical fiction when it starts to blend in real people and events. In this case, much of the novel lands Frost with George Washington, and the hagiography is just way too much. (If you thought Frost was too perfect, you haven't seen anything yet.)Fender can be an entertaining writer, but let's hope he keeps his people in their own world from now on."
4,Great swashbuckler with American History frosting.,"I really enjoyed this series. It reminds me quite strongly of the Kenneth Roberts classics Arundel, Rabble in Arms and Oliver Wiswell. The period speach adds to the charm and I would hate to see it any other way. A big poroblem though is that the auther several times drips in sentences in Portugese or even Chinese..with no translations provided except for the structure of the story. I would like to have the direct translation at least as a footnote. The main problem with this series though is that the two softback volumes I got have the most miserable binding you can put on a book. It demands you use two hands to read it unless you are OK with breaking the spine. In short, it just will not lay open flat. I bought the third volume, used, in hardback and wish I had done so for the others. Go ahead and buy the book, you will enjoy it. But buy the used hard back volumes and avoid the problem."
3,"Christmas songs from the ""Best Christmas Songs Ever""","This ""The Best Christmas Songs Ever"" has a lot of nice Christmas music. It is an easy arrangement and would do nicely for a student of piano in about grade two. It did not quite reach my expectations but I have played piano for fifty-five years and have a lot of music. This book did have some songs that I did not have and I enjoy playing from it. It is sold at a bargain price and well worth the money ."
5,Excellent product,"We installed this Delta water filter to replace a poorly performing PuR-labelled undersink system. The Delta is fantastic, delivering great water pressure and easy filter replacement."
3,Pretty Good Filter,"I have always had under the sink filters in my home. I bought this at Menards, liking the aesthetic. I've had it for four years, it works great, and still looks nice. It stops working when it is time to replace the filter, which is both annoying and functional. I live in a rural area and it is hard to find the replacement filters, but they are relatively inexpensive. My main complaint is that the filter is less effective, less filtration function, and smaller/fewer cartridges than the Culligan I had in the past."
5,Great Glove,"If you practice bassebal this is a must have, great glove and shape the leather feels so nice ,only complain the seller have to change the picture on website, because the glove only comes in black color ,price rocks ,my son is a pitcher and is been using it for two months now .He loves it .Best glove ever!!!!!Super fast shipping."
3,Alright,"The price really says it all, and that applies to every pair of headphones/ear buds you buy. For this cheap price I would probably recommend these, especially if you want a pair that you can treat like crap and an alternative.I've had problems keeping these fitting in my ears but do feel well they're properly fitted. The sound definitely isn't great but is plenty loud. For it's price its a good buy."
2,Bought an extra just in case,I tend to rate things based on value(cost and quality considered). I knew that they wouldn't last long but you would hope that they would last longer than one time. The second pair has made it through one workout up to this point. At least they are comfortable.
3,Loose Fit,I spend more time fixing and adjusting these head buds thn enjoying my music! They are constantly falling off or forward onto my face.
1,In a word...uncomfortable,"I bought these because I can't seem to keep headphones in this house to save my soul. I've been through both expensive ones and cheap ones and none last very long, so anymore I tend to buy cheap because this family is hard on them and just because they are on my computer or MP3 player it doesn't mean they won't get used by someone else. However, I'm betting that these will last forever because no one will like them.Other than a free pair that came with my cell phone, these are hands down the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever tried. They actually make my ears ache after about 10 minutes. The ends are made of a softer material, but not soft enough and they are huge which is probably the biggest factor in their lack of comfort.They also do not block out any other room noise. At all. So if you have difficulty hearing with other background noise, definitely skip these."
1,They don't stay in your ears!,These seem really cool but the design is flawed in that they spring outward from your head and literally don't stay in your ears! Bad choice. My FAV earphones like this are these: Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones for $9.14. I LOVE them!
2,Expected more from Maxell,For a item this inexpensive I wasn't expecting these head phones to rival Bose...But the sound has a very poor high octave quality. I expected more range on the bass side and it just wasn't there no matter how I adjusted the device that these head phones were plugged in too. I would never purchase this item again. I was much happier with the Sony Ultra light weight that I also purchased.
2,EHH NOT SOO MUCH,it was good for like 3 days and my ear was EARitated by the desin and then it broke ain like 1 wk osoo u pay for what u get
1,bad product,"terrible sound, and a bad fit over the hear. the buds are bulbous. the cheap <$10 sonys are way way better"
1,Not the best,I found the sound to be sub par. No bass at all. The part that fits in the ear was quite large. Way to big to fit comfortably in my ear. Seems flimsy and not well made.
3,Rocket Buds?,The jury is still out on these rocket engine shaped earbuds. I was expecing vertical in ear similar to Sony. These are definalely not as good and lack bass.
2,Virtually Useless Headphones,Design offers no pressure inward to hold the ear buds in your ears! What a foolish product. Can't comment on the sound quality or any other aspect since the product simply is of no use if the buds won't stay in.
5,Classic Sony's best mini phones.Best buy,"Very balanced sound ; Deep Base, nice Mid and soft Highs. Perfect after a week of burning. There is nothing on the market today, that can match price + quality = I recommend it highly. *****"
4,Good value and getting scarce,"I love these. And if you like this vertical design, I recommend buying a few while you still can. (The design has yielded favor to hip-hop styles and earbuds, so Maxell seems to be discontinuing this model. It's disappeared from all the drugstores where I used to see it.)Face it: no mfr.'s compact headphones/earbuds last very long under normal use. A cord gets tugged once too many, you permanently lose one channel or the other, and then you can't access the connections to re-solder them.At least with these Maxell's, you minimize your upfront investment. They're comfortable and sound almost as good as the corresponding Sony models, but they cost only 1/2 or 1/3 the price. Maxell's cord is also a foot longer than Sony's (4' instead of 3'), which makes a surprising difference in convenience if you're plugging them into a laptop or into desktop computer speakers."
3,"Alright for the price, I guess,","These things are okay to sit around and listen to alone, but while you're active, these things will fall apart. First the cushions on the buds will fall off and vanish forever, and if you have a big head like I do, they will fall from their band, causing frequent reattachment. If you're looking cheap, then try them out, but otherwise you should look elsewhere.This was supposed to be a 2 star review, BTW.EDIT: One of the speakers died yesterday, so I tossed them in the trash. With that, the search for the perfect headphones continues..."
2,cheaply made,"Sound is ok. These are made pretty cheezy. Don't really fit your head too well. Top band is so flexible they will barely stay on your head. I would pass on these if I were you. Did not pay much, but at least expected to be able to use them. Pay a little more and get something half decent."
1,Total fail!,Not happening for running or biking at all. The band is flimsy and won't stay in your ears or on your head. It's laughable. All I want is an in-ear head set for sports. Like the one's made for decades before ear buds came out. In other words: a thin METAL band overhead.
2,"Light, Compact, Good Sound but short life",I had these less than 2 weeks when the left speaker blew. It's too bad because the sound quality was fine and they are easy and comfortable to wear. I prefer over the head type headphone because they stay on so much better than ear buds while doing activity. I wish someone could make a little more heavy-duty version of this simple design that would last at least more than a few uses.
5,Great camera! Very good video and microphone,"I am having a very good time using this camera when I am talking to my family and friends. It has a good quality video. Camera automatically adjusts brightness depending on the light level in your room. The built-in microphone is very sensitive. I don't need to shout in order to be heard clearly. It works great with Skype and GoogleTalk. Really, this is a very good camera. You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Great starter webcam, and Vista compatible.","Great camera. I bought it for my toshiba satellite laptop, with Windows Vista. I simply plugged in the camera, Vista recognized it and downloaded the drivers and the Logitech program, and I was good to go. The picture quality seemed a little poor, at first, but as soon as I adjusted the focus, it was pristine. The video is a bit delayed, but why wouldn't it be when transmitting video over the web. The cameras on big news stations are just as delayed. I'm sure there are cameras that are better out there, but the quality, ease of use, and reliability of this camera make it excellent. Plus, it works with Vista, and very little components seem to work with Vista."
5,This book can save your life!,"This book should be on everyone's shelf. At Home, at work, in a restaurant- even in every taxi in America. Bravo Dr. Fischer- and thank you for putting out this outstanding little book."
1,"Poor product- I would not buy, Don't waste your money","First of all the binoculars were broken, but for my surprise the left lens was opened by somebody, so they did know the problem, because it was without the glue, with broken plastic pieces the lense was backwards, so they try to fix it but they couldnt and then they send that crap to me!I have to use as a monocular - not a binocular."
2,Not satisfied with the quality,"Right now 2 stars may be generous. I've had these almost 5 years. They've never been great. I get double-imaging even at 10x. Once you zoom, forget it. It's like looking thru a Coke bottle. I understand that I may be able to collimate them, and I will try, but I thin they should have been adjusted @ the factory! Even my 16 yr old nephew with teenage vision says they aren't good. He prefers the 50 year old set of Bushnells. They are sharper. 50 yrs old and clearer. I'll adjust them best I can and keep them on the boat. If they fall into the lake I won't shed a tear.UPDATE: This weekend I collimated them as best I could. @ 10X I got rid of most of the blurriness/double-imaging. So they're usable at least in this state. However once you zoom, everything becomes distorted again. If you need zoom binocs buy a high quality pair. I should have just bought a fixed zoom set and saved $20."
4,Pretty good for what I paid!,Inexpensive pair of binoculars. For what I paid I can't really find fault with them. People need to be realistic when buying a lower cost item. I found them to be decent in all aspects.
1,Poor product- I would not buy,"The focus between both lenses don't work together - have to use as a monocular - not a binocular.The zoom lever is poor- very choppy and not easy to zoom smooth.Poor product, and will return."
4,great value,"These budget priced binoculars are great for the money. As with all zoom optics you can't expect the same quality vision compared to fixed lens models. I reckon the optical quality at base 10x is excellent all the same and is quite good up to about 18x, but tails off up to max magnification of 30x. We already have a pair of Bushnell powerview 16x which my wife uses and I was quite surprised to find the Celestrons to be so close in optical quality.OK the downsides, not many but purple fringing (chromatic aberation) can be quite noticeable when viewing contrasty images. The plastic case is dead cheap and the lanyard is lirttle more than a shoelace. What can you expect for bucks? It's a steal."
2,Wow; Blown Away. Update;,"I was completely blown away with this set of binoculars, ""its like,"" where have I been? This set exceeds my expectations. The clarity is fantastic even at very long distance, the zoom feature is great. This is truely the best set of binoculars I've had the pleasure of owning; as a matter fact I have already ordered another set, the Upclose 12x25 model for in the woods viewing. Thanks Celestron. Update; After owning these a few weeks the zoom broke, so I sent them back after being told that there would be no charge, well then received an email stating there was a charge, so I just sent a copy of the first email and no charge. Poor customer service and the binoculors well there still broke when you zoom. There fine for long distance but very poor zoom feature. That was my main reason for purchasing these binoculars. So disappointed with my purchase and the way they delt with the repair. They charge 25 dollars just to send it back. Not very professonial. Thank you."
5,Excellent and economical!,"I bought this product from Digital Foto who shipped it fast. This item is wonderful after you adjust the interpupillary distance and focus. It's easy to zoom for magnified images. Compare field view of 215 ft/1000ft to barska's 195/1000. 14 mm eye relief is just enough for me, an eye glass wearer.More than enough for birding and even good for entry-level astronomical observations. Highly recommended!"
1,Don't waste your money,I got this thinking that it can be used during vacation but this is no good. Right from the day I received this is has double vision. Dont waste your money.
5,Great inexpensive binoculars,"This is a great inexpensive product. Good pair of binoculars just to throw in the truck and have when you need them. The optics are good for the price, slightly blury at full zoom, but not bad at all. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for good binoculars at a great price."
3,Not as good as the predecessors....,"This is considerably more gloomy, with images of fire-bombed Tokyo, suicide, and unhappy lives lived. I'm not squeemish about such topics, but I had hoped they would be underlined with the same humor and intelligence as his prior efforts, Tokyo Suckerpuch and Hokkaido Popsicle. Unfortunately, the story feels more forced, and the humor is lacking, though not entirely absent. If you liked the previous two, get this one as well, but hold out hope that the next Billy Chaka adventure returns to his prior excitement."
4,entertaining and relatively fast paced,"I purchased this while on a schoool trip to New York, and found it moderately entertaining. I have no idea how accurate a portrayal of Tokyo it is (have to pester my friend about that...) and frankly I don't care... it's a fun, easy read and an even better re-read. The complete story line is some what forgettable, but the characters aren't. If you want a realistic portrayal of Japanese culture then this probably isn't for you, but if you want to slaughter a few helplesss hours with an entertaining mystery story read this one, chances are, you won't be disappointed."
2,There are better light-sabers out there,"I was disappointed to discover that this light saber didn't light up, or make that characteristic ""woosh"" noise. This is one item that I should have bought at a brick and mortar store so I could actually read all the features (or lack thereof) on the packaging."
2,light saber,"No lights, handle not realistic, and the release mechanisim for the telescopic saber completely useless.Wasted my money on this one, although the price was not too much, hence you get what you paid for it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old son who enjoyed playing with it for a day. We made a mistake, as we thought we bought the one that lit up as well as made lightsaber sounds. This one doesn't, but for the same price! This is basically a plastic cone that does not ""spring"" out to form, nor does it retract back in place (the cone gets stuck every time.) This was a waste of money, my son has more fun with sticks in the yard."
3,Durable and Fun for Creating Saber Routines,"Well, it doesn't flash and flicker nor does it make all sorts of cool cosmic noises but our son (and Dad) had fun with these. They frequently make up ""routines"" and they prefer a durable lightsaber w/o all the bells and whistles to one with all the bells and whistles that falls apart easily. This toy is pretty durable!"
1,A Complete Rip off!!!,This was an absolute complete RIP OFF!!! The product fulfilled in my order was a cheap $10-12 collapsable saber that did not actually light up. This was a Christmas gift for my nephew and was a complete embarrassment and disappointment. I highly recommend buying this item in person so you get what you actually pay for.
1,Disappointed,This light stick does not light up. I didn't think the description was clear. Had I read more of the evaluations I would have known that. I returned it.
3,Return? No to what made him!,"If I remember a review that was written on the sticker of this album....""Roni Size Gives DnB a 'Human' touch"".What the heck does that mean?He got some MCs? He did a few ""down-tempo"" tracks? None of the tracks sound like the track that made him known (you know which one)?Is it the simple fact that this album sounds nothing like his previous style? Is it the fact that when someone does an album with more familiar melodies,tempos and Vocals that an album becomes more human? Is he now a HipHop pro all of a sudden?Are the earlier days of DnB considered inhuman?And Lasstly, is it a fact that to bring an ""outsider"" genre of music to the commercial forefront, you need either a cool video or some rapping and more coherent rhythms?Roni pulls off some bangin' tracks here, but it's not a return to V Recordings (if the average customer even knows what that 'V'means)."
1,Avoid this camera,"After two accidents with Olympus Stylus cameras (not the camera's fault, but my kids), I went to Target to purchase yet another one (the third in six months). The clerk recommended this Minolta - all of the same features of my Olympus, but it didn't have the slide front that can often become damaged on the Olympus. I went for it, and I've regretted it ever since. Every time I put my eye up to the viewfinder to take a picture something is wrong. I have to put the camera down and look through it once again to get a green ""ready"" light. Otherwise, it won't let you take the picture. Once you take a picture, you have to wait at least 30 seconds before taking another. I have missed so many good shots. This one is going on Ebay, and I'm switching back to Olympus!"
1,the little thing is not very little!,"Cost prevented me from returning this product. The key problem area on all Hummingbird feeders is the feeding ports - the small brush on this set is waaaay to big for any of the feeders I have (Perky Pet / Aspects Humzinger / Birdscapes 710 brushed metal feeder). Actually, the small brush is too big for any feeder.How bad is that?I have swallowed my pride and will be writing off the cost of this item."
5,Product review,The Brushtech B22C Humingbird Feeder Cleaning Kit does a great job. Glad I bought it! You can get to all the small and hidden areas of the feeder.
2,Hummingbird feeder brushes,"Long brush is too flimsy to let you clean deep into the feeder. It bends instead of brushing along the sides. Smaller brushes work ok, but do not reach far enough to get to places I need to clean. I got what I paid for, since the price was so low."
4,brushes assortment,Think they are a good assortment. Came in a timely manner but have yet to used them.... packed well and arrived as promised.
4,Utility at a good price,These brushes seem well made and designed for cleaning hummingbird feeders and the price is good.
1,"Not bad brushes, but too big for my feeder","These are okay as bottle brushes, but they're all too big for my run-of-the-mill hummingbird feeder. Bend the wire too much or too often and it will break off. Useless to me."
5,Mirror image of my right mirror.,This was just as advertised and so easy to install. You could kick your mirror off and just buy this and no one would ever know. Get this is if you want to have a factory left mirror for your Pontiac grand am.
5,Pontiac Grand Am driver side power mirror,This mirror was shipped quickly and was a perfect fit for my '01 Grand Am. The new mirror was on in no time! I would highly recommend this product for replacing your mirror on your Grand Am.
5,99-02 Grand Am Mirror Power,This is a perfect fit and same quality of OEM. Everything including electrical fit just as the original. The price you can't beat it. Their customer service was courteous friendly and very helpful. Shipping to Canada was reasonable and they use reliable shipping. I had the new mirror in place in 15 minutes flat without a single adjustment. Recommend this product for sure.
1,Never received this itrm,I ordered this item about 2 to 3 months now and I still haven't received it. I sent out emails no answer. I called and left messages no one called back.
5,"Great price, installed it myself","The dealer quoted me $180 to put a new mirror on my car. A friend suggested I search for the part online, and sure enough, I found it here. Was thrilled with the price, but not sure if I'd be able install it -- still, labor and a cheaper part was better than having to pay $180 for both. The shipping took a little longer than I was hoping, but it arrived in great shape. Decided to try the install myself, and sure enough, I figured it out and got the new mirror on with no problem. If your mirror has been damaged, don't pay high dealer prices to repair when you can do it this easily!"
4,Moving Message,"This book does have an epic quality about it... Also, it is the type of book that calls to and connects with the spiritual side of all of us regardless of our individual culture, race or gender. Ms. Boyd's gift is bringing a beautiful narrative quality to the experiences shared by her Mother, Grandmother and Great-Grandmother as well as her own. As the challenges and hardships are recounted it seems incredible that the harshness experienced was so recent, relatively speaking. In a time before domestic-violence laws (as recently as 20 - 30 years ago) options were few and overcoming such oppressive treatment seemed to be as much an act of faith as of will. This is a story that's important to all, not just to these lovely Lawson women."
5,good deal,"Brand new book, fair price. Even I had accidentally typed in a wrong address, I received the book after several weeks."
5,Amazing Booklet!,"Benjamin Harrison Freedman, who lived from 1890 to 1984, and who spent his adult life until 1946 as a prominent Jewish businessman of New York City and as a Zionist operative deeply involved in the power politics of the Jewish supremacists as they cemented their hold on the American government in the first half of the 20th century. But Freedman would have been just another name on the roster of Jewish ""advisors"" and handlers of American presidents and politicians if he had not made a fateful decision in 1946 to break with the Zionist establishment. For the rest of his life, Benjamin Freedman (who eventually converted to Catholicism) worked almost without ceasing to expose the crimes of his former associates. This is a very interesting booklet written by an insider. The knowledge he presents is shocking and prescient, considering the state of our foreign affairs today in our post 9-11 world."
1,disappointing with item,I'm so upset about that so called antenna because it wasn't what I order. I order the one that you plug into an wall outlet. That antenna didn't work because I live between two mountains. The only thing I like was the little hicky that attaches the antenna to the television. So next time I order anything from your company I'll make double sure you understand what I'm buying.Thanks
3,tried to pull a fast one,"sent me a pac instead of the scoshe, then took 25 off so i would keep it. works, no problems."
4,Excellent for the price:,"This monitor is clear and sharp. For the price I am extremely happy with it. Not only did it increase my viewable area, but graphics on a few of the games I play were greatly improved. It arrived at my house with no flaws and surprisingly quick and free shipping.My only complaint is: Where the screen meets the neck of the monitor is rather loose. If you don't have a very sturdy table (Which I will be purchasing soon) the monitor will shake slightly when you type. It would be nice to mount this monitor to the wall though which is also an option."
5,A great buy!,"A good monitor for the day to day computer user.Obviously this wouldn't work for someone who is a gamer. But for everyday use, the picture is clear, and most importantly for my uses the text is crisp. The side to side pivoting action is nice, as is the small amount of tilt.The design is a little clunky, the detachable pencil boxes that attach to the screen are a little silly, but this has no negative effect on the overall product.We're using it with windows 98."
5,Excellent for the office!,"I was very surprised by the quality of the dispaly on this monitor. The 90-degree rotation feature is awesome for applications such as Word, and browsing the web. Great value!"
5,Works Great!,"No problems, no ghosting, looks beautiful in high resolution ( I mean, really, you will never go back to 1024x768 ever again!)Besides that its awesome and that I fully recommend it, I have a tip for high res users (with XP):Right Click the desktop,Click on the ""Apperance"" tab,Click on ""Effects"" in the lower right corner,Check ""Use Large Icons""Now you will have high res icons and desktop, looks beautiful!"
1,"Envision 17"" LCD Monitor","The monitor died 8 days after I plugged it in. It never recovered, and the service center was not able to revive it. Ultimately they chose to replace the Envision monitor with an AOC monitor which I am currently using. It's been 8 days since I plugged it in. I remain an optimist."
4,Good but heavy,"This power pack works very well (and keeps it's charge for a very long time) however, it is heavy and you've got to be committed to the weight. I've tried to hang it on the center section of my tripod to keep the weight off of me, however, you got to be careful not to tip over the tripod."
3,NOT a direct replacement,"This item is advertised as a replacement for MOST 500 watt worklights, but it is NOT a direct replacement for a Utilitech, WL500HSp. The big problem is that the bracket holes are not in the same locations. However, by disassembling both old and new sockets, and utilizing the old bracket, and some hardware from each, you can get it back together and install it. The wire in this new unit is smaller gauge, and is not covered by fiberglass insulation, and the nuts/bolts in the new unit are smaller than the old. It took 2 hrs to do what should have been a 20 minute repair."
1,Larry North,"I purchased this program over 1 year ago, and I am sure it is a good product, but it did not work for me. I returned the merchandise and was never refunded my money or the products. I contacted customer serviec on numerous attempts by phone and correspondence and finally the number was disconnected.I was very disappointed in the product and the customer service and therefore in Larry North, because ultimately his name is on the product. I just want the comsumers to be aware that if they do not like the product and decide to return it, to be careful because you will not be get your money back or even the merchandise that you return."
1,No merchandise:lots of headaches,Unfortunately i have had a bad experience with the company qna slimdown express which is where the bars and vitamins come from. I haven't talked to a live person since Aug.2000. I recieved vitamins in Oct>2000 but had no way to receive a return authorization as the phone number was disconnected. i am still being billed on my credit card for merchandise I have not recieved. I have faxed the company but got no response. In my opinion I would nevewr order anything else from this company.
4,Great for the price.,"They are not Bose, but for the money who can complain. They are relatively durable and sound relatively good. I use these in a commercial application, they hold up well. I have bought many of these in the last year or so."
2,EHH,not the best quality not that loudi stopped using them they are just in my drawer collecting dusti say get something else
3,doesnt look like the picture,a little upset that product i recieved doesnt even come close to the picture. Yes it is maxwell headphone but the picture shows a sleek looking design and i recieved a more bullky pair.
2,works well - but not useable,"Sound is quite good and the construction is good. The bad part is that the cord is very, very short -- less than half of the length of any other headphone cord I've had, so you better keep your laptop real close. Also, they're way too tight for an adult, and there's no way to adjust the size. They're painful after using just 15-30 minutes. Looks like I'll have to replace these."
3,Slick and cool,"This product is pretty neat. It hooks up to my MP3 player and my laptop. I wish the cord was a foot longer though. I keep pulling it out when I move around. But all-in-all, it is a great product with great sound."
4,They do the job,"These headphones have an unbelievably low price. They won't make you feel like you're at a live concert or anything, but why would you expect that from something less than $10? I use these at the office so I don't bother coworkers. The cleaners usually run over the cords and kill my headsets every couple of months, so paying more makes no sense at all. They do the job needed and are extremely affordable."
3,not bad for the price,"The sound isn't great, the fit isn't great, they get sweaty and gross. Those are the good qualities!Seriously though, they do what they are supposed to do. You can run and wear a baseball cap at the same time. That has to count for something, eight?"
4,Work,"They arrived on time and worked as expected. Hard to go wrong with headphones, so not particularly surprised they worked..."
1,not great,"These are very tight like they were made for a kid's head. Sound quality is awful, my earbuds are way better. Save your money don't bother with these."
4,Not Bad For The Price,"I bought these headphones for less than $5. Based on my experience, 'phones in this price range generally don't preform very well. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to find they recepted fairly well to bass and treble with only a little static at the higher ranges, but I can't complain for the price. The ear padding isn't of very high quality - a little scratchy - but keeps everything in place nonetheless. If you're looking for a cheap pair of headphones with satisfactory sound quality, I definitely recommend these."
1,Maxell Neckband Head Buds are AWFUL,This is probably the biggest waste of 5 dollars in my life. They just dig into your skull and project poor sound quality onto your all ready in pain ear drum.
2,Head set too tight,"The headset part is too tight, and uncomfortable after more than 45 minutes. Sound was good, though, but not enough to make it worth it."
5,Great,"Great, I received the case in a timely fashion. It will provide exactly what I need to protect my fire for travel."
3,Tough Case,"The case boasts a tough exterior that will with stand abusive conditions while protecting equipment instide. However, the latches are excessively difficult to open and close. The positive and negative points balance to a 3 star rating."
4,"Great case, but......",I will begin by stating in general I have come to trust and appreciate Pelican cases over the years as I do with my most current purchase of the 1400 series. The only drawback in this case was when I dropped it by accident the hinges flew open on both occasions. Perhaps something to do with their new hinge design???? Otherwise very good product.
5,Pelican 1400,"Pelican cases are so strong, they will take the abuse from shipping, weather, neglect, and more.Perfect for keeping things like the Taser X26 or Springfield XD sub-compact protected with room to spare for extra cartridges and magazines.Reinforced locks and pressure equalization valve are great for traveling with the unit!"
4,Great Case,This is a great case it offers great protection and is water proof. It was easy to customize the foam to my needs.
2,Absolutely LOADED with filler.,"With as many books as there are about the history of Red River, New Mexico--a picturesque former gold mining town set high in the mountains of the northern part of the state--this little out-of-print book is really not worth the high price it usually costs. (Last I checked, Amazon had it listed for $115.)The book runs only twenty pages long, and most of the last half of it is nothing but padding--full of whole, not-that-relevant newspaper articles in their entirety.The book does contain some good information and some interesting facts, but if you'd really like to read a thorough history of Red River, I'd recommend reading THE RED RIVER-TWINING AREA, by Jim Berry Pearson instead."
4,Great Jack in the Box SpongeBob,Both my 5 year old and my 19 month old enjoy this toy. It is fun and classic with a modern new twist that every child loves - Spongebob!
4,intenerting confrontation between superheroes and new forces,"As a parent, I constantly extoll my kids to ""be smarter, not stronger"" when dealing with obstacles in life. Often this runs counter to superhero philosophies - maybe because in comics and other visual media, fighting stronger makes for more interesting visuals. A benefit of superhero prose, like Gen13: Time and Chance, is that the written word can make the character's internal processes and thoughts as involving as the action sequences. Fans will get some of both approaches as Caitlin, Sarah, Bobby, Edward and Roxy (AKA Fairchild, Rainmaker, Burnout, Grunge and Freefall) battle an opponent whose abilities rival those of Max Faraday from ""Divine Right."""
4,Scott is a brilliant writer!!,"I've been to the bookstores and have seen a lot of your books and find the characters to be believable and empathetic. Young people seem to really enjoy your style and ability to create surprise, mystery and excite, all the while weaving very grounded principles and morals to the stories."
3,One~Half Vs. One~Half,I really enjoyed the first disc but the other disc not so much. However; for the price it was still a good buy. I'm not saying someone out there wouldn't enjoy the ones I didn't like. I'll give the disliked disc to a friend so it all works out in the end!
5,The most comfortable golf sandal ever!,"I've owned several pair of Bite Golf Sandals and have always been pleased with their product, but these sandals take comfort to a whole new level. The orthotic footbed is made of a beuatifully soft material that provides excellent support and doesn't make your feet perspire like a rubber footbed. These sandals make me feel like I'm playing golf in my slippers! They also look sharp on my size ten foot!"
1,Huge Blister,"I bought a pair of these golf sandals after giving them to a friend as a retirement gift. I liked the way they looked and the fact that several reviewers said that they were very comfortable. Although they initially felt comfortable and seemed to be the correct size, the second time I wore them, I developed a huge blood blister on the back of my heel. I had to have it drained at an urgent care facility. I sent back both mine and my friend's (she hadn't worn hers yet). I am hoping that I will get a refund. I do NOT recommend these."
3,Glue stick great for crafting,"I originally bought this glue because I needed to purchase something else with my order so that I could get free shipping. To my surprise, the glue is very useful for crafting. I am using it for scrap booking. It is a great glue for this project."
4,Good product,"Overall a good product, photos seem to adhere well to paper with it. I've only just used it though so i don't know if they'll become loose with time. The pen looks like a small glue stick and sometimes the product builds up but other than that it works very well."
1,Dried out!,"I opened it and it was completely dried out. Bummer, because I threw away the packing slip and can't return it. I went to the dollar store and got three for a dollar and they work perfectly."
2,Really ?,Tiny glue stickOverpricedNot for broad applications .. Tiny tipGet a good alternative / brand name at 99 cent store
2,This product is ok....,This works great however some of the glue stick that I have purchased had dried up and I couldn't use them for my project.
1,Waste of Money!,"I recently purchased this glue stick and soon discovered that this glue couldn't even stick paper together!!! Waste of money, time, & energy!!!!"
1,Totally dried up,"This was totally dried up the minute I took it out of package. I don't like wasting money, and wish there was a way to contact to get a refund even for this small purchase."
1,Waste of money,"I got this glue pen in the mail, and the glue was horrible, worked for about 10 pictures - with just four or five dabs and then was completely out. Not worth the money. Buy something else."
1,Glue stick,I was not impressed at all with this glue stick...it was hard and would not glue without alot of pressure and then came apart...I think it is too old??
1,Dried up!,"The glue stick was shipped completely dried up. I didn't realize this until after I had opened it and thrown out the packaging. Don't know if I got a bum stick, but it was completely useless!"
1,Glueless Stick,PIONEER ACID-FREE GLUE STICK PENI opened the glue stick to find a solid rubbery substance inside that obviously had dried out years ago. It isn't worth paying the return shipping. I am glad I only ordered one to try it out. It went directly into the trash. Needless to say I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLERhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CAOGX/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
4,Actually works!,"I had originally bought this product because I was a few dollars off from qualifying for Free Shipping. I had expected it to be dried and worthless, but was surprised to find that it really worked quite well on photos, construction paper, and other pictures. However, it has lost some of its effectiveness over time, especially because it's located on a desk right next to a small space heater that is constantly on. If you do a lot of arts and crafts and can use this glue stick in less than 2 months, it's worth it."
3,"If you seal a lot of envelopes, this is for you, but read carefully.","Absolutely no quality control whatsoever. One out of every two has some defect or other; dried out, empty, only 1/2 full. But, since Avery Glue Pens are no longer available, if you seal a lot of envelopes this is the only choice.Just order them by the dozen..."
2,dont get this on a Finished table,this is a major disaster. I cant believe this stuff just destroyed my table! the glue on the other hand works fine!
1,Terrible!,"Worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon! Gave it one star so you didnt think i forgot to rate it. I make photo cards all the time and thought I'd try something other than the tape rollers. That was a mistake. Right out of the package it was like trying to glue with a chunk of hard plastic. Not even sticky at all. I emptied the glue stick all the way and even the last possible section was bone dry.They got one thing right... its acid free. Glue free too. Maybe it worked the day it was made in China but stay away from this junk, crap, total waste of time and money. There... I feel better now."
2,It sticks very well but the glue does not last very much,"I bought 2 as gift for my wife, she likes doing scrapbooking and will try it, I was hoping that they were useful to her. Sticks very well, but only could apply glue in +/- 30 photography 4x6 inches size, applying a little glue over edge of each photo. In general, it sticks well, but the glue does not last very much."
3,Pretty good...,"I bought the glue stick with the intent to use it for scrapbooking, however so far I have only used it on a school project w/ my son. We were putting paper pictures on a poster board. The glue worked well enough, but I would not recommend it for this type of use. If we bent the poster board the pictures would start to pop off. I'm guessing it will work better on my scrapbook pages."
1,Dried up,"Unfortunately, the glue was completely dried up when I got it, even though it was shipped within just a few days. My guess is there's a whole batch of dried out glue sticks lying around the Amazon warehouse... The product was useless."
2,Nothing special,"All this is is a glue stick that runs out really quickly. It was fine, did the trick. I guess it doesn't advertise itself as anything else, but I was disappointed."
1,Dried up,This product arrived dried up and useless. Only reason I did not return it is because it would have been more bother than it was worth. Last time I order a product like this.
4,OK Glue,"It does the basic work a glue is supposed to do. Could it be better? Yes, but a crazy glue performance shouldn't be expected from a regular glue. All in all it's a good glue."
1,arrivered completey dried out,"This product arrived completely dried out. The glue had apparently been exposed to air, and was unable to be used at all. This is the second product from Pioneer that I had bought, and will not make this mistake again."
1,Dried up glue sticks!!,I was ready to start scrapbooking when my glue stick arrived. I opened it and it was dried up completely ugh. At least I was able to return it and get my money back.
5,Love Walrus,Who would have thought that Barry White would be reincarnated in 'Whatever It Takes'? I know it's supposed to be a Bill Withers tribute but this was just made for the Walrus of Love to croon to one of his honeys.Hey Ron! Break out the sequined suit and lets go disco!
4,Once again,"Once again Sexsmith delivers. Fans of his early work (and those of us who were a bit disappointed with Cobblestone Runway) will appreciate the understated elegance of this new collection. An excellent first purchase for new fans, and a wonderful addition for us die-hards."
3,Mediocrity is its own reward,"Ronald Eldon Sexsmith crafts pretty love songs that nestle comfortably in the branches of Pop's hallowed tree of folk-country romantics. There are traces of the mushier Elvis Costello and of compatriot, the youthful Bruce Cockburn chiming in occasionally on,'Retriever'. Any of these songs would fit sweetly on 70s Cockburn discs. This is the most even of the three discs I've sampled, the eponymous debut and,'Cobblestone Runway'. Eveness is the catchword here. No striking metaphors or musical phrasings elevate the material from 1000 similar outpourings. It's melodic, well-crafted, and somewhat introspective. These are virtuous qualities. What it does lack, as the great C19th French romantic painter, Cezanne, tersley said, is 'balls'."
1,Cheap/Didn't Work,"I bought this spy kit for my daughter's birthday. The voice recorder does not work at all, and all we hear in the listening device is static. This kit is very cheap, and not worth the money. The binoculars and scope don't work either. Would not suggest purchasing this product."
3,I enjoyed this book,"I wish I could give it a higher score, but the hero was a little too weak for me. Also the ending was a little too pat for me. You could see the ending coming a mile a way."
4,Enjoyable Read!,"Definitely holding up its share of the series!! With Crimson City a vivid picture of vampire life was painted. Crimson City from the Werewolf perspective is painted just as vividly in A Taste of Crimson. Marjorie Liu does a wonderful job describing the society the Werewolves have developed underground. I am not claustrophobic, but as I read, I felt like I was in a tunnel, underground, insulated from the sound, and hustle and bustle of living topside. It was easy to accept how isolated from the other species the werewolves were, how everyone had such preconceived notions of anyone different. I liked that the complex issues raised in the book were not all tied together in a happily ever after way - everyone did the right thing, but it was painful to do so and left scars. If you were the least bit iffy about the series after Crimson City (and I was), this one is well worth the time and money, and will pique your interest in the next one (mine is!)."
5,yummy,"I keep thinking that I have already rated these. However, I can do it again. I loved all of these Crimson City books. Having different authors contributing keeps the stories different and alive. Cant wait for more"
4,WOW!,"This product was very good, and I am very satisfied! Great for athletes who are interested in learning more about the body and food and how they work together."
5,Came highly recommended,"This book came came highly recommended to me by my girlfriend who is a dietitian. She said it covered basic nutrition not just for athletes. I bought this for my husband who has recently had 3 stents fitted and wanted to better understand his new diet. I have not read this book. Based on my girlfriend raving about it, I gave it 5 stars."
4,Mums with junior athletes,"As a mother with a squad swimmer, ""little"" athlete, and a Masters swimmer in the family - this book has proved a winner. Easy to read, and well set out, the only problem with this book is getting it returned from friends who borrow it!"
5,Excellent book,I teach sports nutrition to college students. This book has been great because it helped me relate general nutrition to the athlete. The information is accurate and the examples are very helfpul. Nancy Clark also adds informative tables that relate to sports nutrition. I recommend this book to athletes and nonathletes alike.
2,Very Basic,"Didn't like the book, very basic for someone who has no idea how to eat right. The book based on the ""Pyramid"", it gives general ideas about the right food but does not specify how the same food affects if eaten at different times. Also the metabolic types described very primitive and vague. I wish there would be more useful information instead of just short articles that jump from topic to topic."
4,Great overview of nutrition principles,"This is a great book for introducing you to overall nutrition concepts - even for those who are not focused on sports nutrition. One of my goals is to get a better understanding of how to eat right for my running and I used this book to get started.Clark sites study after study to support her overall thesis and presents a very well support thesis. The major points that I got from this book were: (1) eat the right combination of nutrients by aiming for 3 of the 5 food groups at each meal and (2) the key to loosing or controlling weights in calories - not carb-protein ratios.Clark first goes through each of the food groups and goes over what quantities and types we should be aiming for in each. Throughout the book she debunks various fad diets. She also spends a lot of time looking at eating disorders, which I did not find quite a useful. The final section of the book goes over numerous recipes."
5,Changed the way I eat,"I was a pretty picky eater until I read this book. After understanding the importance of so many nutrients (and where to find them), I changed my eating habits and exposed myself to several new foods that I now love! I feel so much more educated in nutrition than I ever was before."
4,Enjoyed it,This is first for me and I enjoyed the concert. I have been a Return To Forever since 1973 and I still love and respect all of the members of this group even though they have all chosen their separate paths and can still unite and make good music. A lot of musicians fail to accomplish this trait. I hope that I can find another DVD. Great work guys.
3,Extraordinary players - Melody is scarce.,"These guys are the best. Technique, improvisation, tightness; all are present here. Melodic music is not. If you enjoy Chick's compositions then this is a much have. If not, it won’t be a BluRay you'll be watching over and over."
3,Unrealized potential,"As an RTF fan since childhood and fusion junkie in general, I bought this Blu-ray DVD with high hopes. The performances are very good and would be brilliant if not for the poor quality of the mix. An almost total lack of bass drum attack robs the performances of their ""tightness"". The dense odd-meter passages require the outline and definition only a properly mic'd and mixed drum kit can provide. Lenny White is fun to watch, but you really cannot hear his expressive playing adequately. The whole show falls flat for me as a result and certainly does not exploit the benefits a Blu-ray production should deliver. Check out the ""Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's"" Blu-ray DVD for an incredible example of sound engineering that complements the performance."
1,Defective Products,"Ordered this product along with others from same source, product did not work in any of my players or Mac computers. Sent product back and ordered another one, got the second one and the same problem again. Took product to a friends home and it would not play on any of his equipment either. Sent product pack and asked for a refund. The other items that I ordered worked fine on all my equipment. I would love to have a recording of this performance if you ever find out what the problem is on your end!"
1,Yawn.,"Having read a few autobiographies of American war correspondents, I was really expecting more from this book. To say that Hastings employs the British gift of understatement would be a kind way of describing the monotony of most of it."
4,Nice little lunch tote,"This is a nice little lunch tote with good insulation. It is not enormous, so not an option for days that you're looking to bring a tupperware container of something, but perfect for a sandwich, soda, and snack bar. The front pocket comes in especially handy.My only complaint is that the handles, which are a hard clear plastic, are not large enough to fit comfortably over my hand, and my hands are fairly small. This makes is slightly more difficult to maneuver on the subway and such when I have other bags with me. Otherwise, a nice item."
3,Stylish but not sturdy,"I really like the design of this product, but the zipper that closes the top broke the first week I used it. Also, the plastic handles were a bit annoying because they would slide around because the tabs holding them to the bag were too large. Outside pocket seemed an afterthought -- too small to hold anything useful like utensils. Definitely a case of style over substance."
2,OK,"this is ok, the construction is a little shotty and the insulation is nil, there are better ones for the price."
5,Beautifully realized..,"I'll be the first to admit I had never heard of Alex Grey before. However, I am a fan of the music group Tool. The artwork on their new CD was done by Alex Grey. I never paid this much mind until I was in a book store a couple weeks ago and passed right by ""Sacred Mirrors"". I stopped, turned around, snatched it up and ran to the counter. Upon further reading I must say it is phenomenal..The essays presented talk about Alex and his work. They provide an indepth look at his philosophies on transcendence. While enjoyable to read the real reason to buy the book is the art. I have never seen anything quite like Grey's work. It is bold and bright. His use of colors and their correspondence in the human body are simply amazing.This book is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to view the human body; our physical, mental, and most importantly, our spiritual side, in a whole new light."
4,Nice coffee table book,"I liked it. It was thorough in capturing the spirit of autumn...that time of year we all crave and love. If you're an SEC freak like me try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" Whew! Those Cajun recipes are killer! A seriously good college football book like this one."
3,Too repititive between editions,"It is hard to distinguish one issue of this magazine from the next. Too much repitition with respect to technique and equipment. Not enough equipment reviews or other aspects of video (i.e., festivals, etc.). The articles on technique are almost clones of each other from issue to issue. Also, too many advertisements."
4,gift,this was a gift for my uncle BUT he says it's an awesome magazine. This was an easy way for me to renew his subscription as a Christmas gift.
2,Don't buy this book,"This is an Audi book written for English consumers--with English address for information and repair, and (I think) models that were popular in England. Not much applies to cars common in the U.S., like Audi 4000's or 5000's (are they the same as the 80's, 90's, A6's (I don't know and the book doesn't say.))There is some brief history of Audi, a lot of racing history, and lot of turbo information, and not much else. The buying section is poor and mainly for overseas, the repairing section is only a few generic pictures and narratives and nothing usable, and the tuning only applies to turbos and high performance, nothing usable for the normal driver.There is little about how the AWD works and how to optimally drive it for the normal driver.A few tidbits of information, but definitly not a reference book.There is a whole chapter on how to keep your car from being stolen, which I found silly.Some nice pictures of race cars.I find this an armchair book and not much else."
4,This book is worth its money! Real good advices.,"There are still not a lot of books about the audi quattro and this one is real good. There is a good structure between history, ralley, technical and advices in any case. The only thing i miss is the circumstance, that there not enough of full colored picture of the sport quattro and quattros with the drivers seat on the left side. All in all a very interesting book an a must for every audi quattro fan."
3,pretty but not high quality,"The drawers look good, especially after staining, but the quality is not great. The wood has cracks, it splintered often during sanding, and the front panels of the two drawers are not identical (it looks like one was finished backwards in comparison to the other). Overall, not bad, but not quite worth the money."
1,AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE,JUNK.........MISLEADING ADVERTISING........WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT ONE STAR...HAD TO...TO WRITE A REVIEW
5,Toast 6... Simplest software to use,"I would recommend Toast 6 over any other burning app on the Mac (yes, the finder included). I can make PC compatible discs for sharing with my friends, burn straight out of iphoto, itunes, use iMovie projects without having to export them (which takes forever). Toast 6 works great with my Lacie FireWire 106 drive and my G5.Toast 6 also came with CD Spin Doctor 2 (very nice!) Discus (label maker program) and Motion Pictures (easier than iPhoto + ken burns effects).If you haven't, purhcase this product, it does not get simpler than this."
3,"Good Historical Fiction, But Characters Somewhat One Dimensional",The historical elements of this novel are wonderfully accurate. The rest of it is largely so-so as the characters are somewhat stilted and the prose kind of heavyhanded.
5,better than the ones I had as a youngin,"I have no purchased one of these things yet, but my friends and I always goof around with them at stores. They are very strong and unlike the light ones, these go all the way in, come out with the push of a button and have a belt clip."
5,Less than $8 at Target and Walmart,"THis is a great toy. My 5 year old will be using it as part of his Halloween costume and loves playing with it. My only regret is that I paid almost $20 for it which according to Amazon was a $5 savings on the retail price. I have since found the same lightsaber at both Target and Walmart for less than $8. SO my advice would be to buy the toy, but not here. I feel ripped off."
1,Very entertaining,I bought a lightsaber like this one right before the realease of episode 3. I also bought a electronic color changing one which i thought would be way cooler then the basic lightsaber. Putting it quite frankly i was terribly mistaken. Sure the electronic lightsaber has the sounds and changes color but u cant even see it in daylight. Plus the basic lightsaber is half the cost of a electronic lightsaber. My friends and i play in the woods every day with our lightsabers. To tell u the truth i traded the lightsaber that changes color for YUGIOH cards. the only bad thing is it is not very educational. it is however quite entertaining. I think the worst thing is if you drop a lightsaber the handle will probaly get scratched or if u use them regularly the blade may be dented. Overall very good by i suggest u buy more and wait until they make better electronic ones.
3,"Nice shoes, bad boot laces...","I buy a pair of this shoes, the shoe quality is very good, well oiled, nice packaged, but I find the boot laces included very!, very! bad... in one week of normal use (I'm not a contractor) they were broken, so I need spend other bucks buying boot laces, for wear again my new boots, it's the first time in my life that I buy a new pair of shoes that cannot last a week at least. So remember buy a extra pair of good boot laces with this shoes."
1,Terrible,"This book is a poor excuse for useful information. Some basic concepts that could have been spelled out in the first two chapters end up taking 12 chapters. The really bad thing is that the concepts were spelled out in the first two chapters and then repeated endlessly throughout the rest of the book. The author is more concerned with stating his own political and social views than he is in giving concrete steps to improve critical thinking. All in all, this is a close to worthless read with too many ""author prescribed"" notions of how society should function. Don't waste you time or you money like I did"
5,Time to sleep little bear.,"Mr Bear's New Baby (Mr.Bear)Mr. Bear's new baby can't sleep, and won't stop crying. While Mr. and Mrs. Bear try their best to get the baby to stop crying and go to sleep, one by one their sleepless forest neighbors arrive to offer help and advice. But it's their own Small Bear who'll have the answer they need.This book honors the role of mothers, siblings, and friends in taking care of a new baby, while at the same time emphasizing a father's role in parenting and celebrating the very special bond between a father and his children. That's no mean feat for a children's story, and this book pulls it off with warmth and style."
2,"Cheap, breakable, and grounds for dismissal.","There are far nicer and better performing devices on the market. This one cracked while washing in the sink. It had no secondary filter (usually near the spout attached to the lid) so some pretty large coffee grounds came floating out. It also had a poor fitting plunger. I ended up with the BonJour Hugo 8-Cup Unbreakable French Press, sold here at Amazon. If you don't like the plastic, go for any metal press by Bodum, but avoid the glass models-- again, they will break given handling during cleaning."
2,A piece of fluff--engaging but little substance,"In terms of readability, Fagan's book is a decent piece of popular science. It makes an engaging argument that human civilizations have been affected mightily by climatic shifts. But it is fraught with problems: I am an expert on the history of El Ni~no, and I can attest that the chapters about El Ni~nos past and the history of scientists' understanding of El Ni~no hit some of the bright spots. But the details are at best inaccuate and at worst highly deceptive. Fagan simply knows little about this subject, otherwise he would have distilled a more accurate account! It simply does not stand up to careful examination. Mickey Glantz's book _Currents of Change_ (1996) is better, although it suffers from similar problems and is less readable. Those who want to read a carefully researched narrative about the El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation and its impact on human history unfortunately have no where to go, yet."
1,Pretend Pretend Pretend,I think the author gets lost in his own thoughts and trys to make storys of something that's not there.
2,Misled,"I ordered the camera case because it was listed as an accessory for a specific camera. It did not fit, but luckily I knew someone with that size camera that was able to use it. Before an item is listed as an accessory it should be verified that it fits that main item."
3,"Quotes yes, but would have liked the book to be more robust","I am a teacher and was looking for a convenient resource to add quotes to my outgoing emails. This book does fit that need, however, I do not feel like much of what is in the book works for what I am looking for. Most of the quotes that I would use could easily be found with a simple google search as well. It is helpful to have it under one cover, and this book categorizes quotes by theme making it a bit quicker to locate an appropriate choice. I probably would not buy this again, unless it was super cheap."
3,addendum to my review below,"Don't start this movie by selecting the first scene (select Play Movie from the main menu). There is a large portion of the movie hidden in the introduction (approximately 1/7, I'm guessing). This movie may have appeared to have more depth had the entire film been seen by me start to finish. The introduction does provide a bit of character background and begins to build the relationship between Ben and Elizabeth. That said, the simplicity of the movie allowed me to not get lost when not seeing the first portion of it."
3,"A little lame, though with a good message.","The story line was very good, but developed and written way too lame. A little too 'pat.' A seemingly strong-willed grand-daughter eager to get money from her grandmother so she and her boyfriend can leave the area (grass is greener situation). However, she is forced to wait as her grandmother tells her story. A good story, and message... However, I cannot see a teenage girl being so pliable; esp. today's teenager, and wait as patiently as this girl does considering her boy friend is waiting impatiently out in the car. Cheryl Ladd, who plays the grandmother, was given a horrible wig for her character, and honestly that was a distraction for me."
5,Great story,"Good Christian movie and had a good message for all young people, I would reccomend it to all young folks."
1,Very boring,"I usually enjoy most romance movies, even ones most would consider sappy. However, this has to be the first romance movie--based on a book--that had me absolutely bored to tears. I kept thinking it would end any second, and then it just kept going, and going, and going. I think if it had ended earlier, it might not have been so bad.Also, when the grandmother was trying to get her granddaughter to stay, the story she told didn't seem to have any relation to the granddaughter's situation. So, I don't know why she was telling it...It was a very depressing movie. One that sort of says, ""All God gives us is destruction, but keep on going anyway..."" I don't think God's like that. He may give us strength to continue on despite circumstances, but He doesn't make bad things happen in our life.I think perhaps the book might have been better (I've never read it). If you haven't read the book, don't watch the movie."
3,I did not care for this movie.,I did not care for this movie. I thought it was quite depressing and sad. I watched it alone to preview for my kids and I did not even show it to them.
1,so traditionally boring and old styled tasteless. no star deserved actually,"well, compare this movie to 'notebook' is simply too much. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. deadbeat and simple-minded storyline with such pretentious acting and unlikable casting.my wife used to like this kinda movies, but after tried 30 minutes, she just told me that this movie was very bad and asked me to reject it from the dvd player. the screenplay was like written by a high school girl, so cliched and so tasteless. don't waste time in this one, rent 'notebook' instead."
5,Great Inspirational Movie!,"Though the budget may not have been all that large and some of the wigs are bad, this is a great film. The story line is a bittersweet feel good story. I have watched it at least four times over the past several years."
4,good view,"This is a good movie that, although it is a bit of a ""Chick Flick"", has a good life message for both sexes and all ages. Nothing in it should embarrass any age group, and the story floating over the message has interest. Life is not about the fireworks, fireworks are nice but fleeting. Life is about the journey and the character built over the years, which, without patience and perserverence cannot be built."
4,Good family film-great story!,I really enjoyed the story line of this movie.I haven't read the book...so I wasn't dissappointed in them changing the story line. Sometimes that is a plus. I was sorry to see a swear word in it...which I felt was totally uncalled for in the movie and just didn't fit. I just add that for those who prefer to buy movies without them. My mom even loved this movie...has watched it about five times. THis is a really good movie with a nice story. Enjoy!!
5,Very good,We really enjoyed this movie. We had forgotten we had seen it before but it was just as good the second time around!
4,Though none go with me,"This is a beautiful story about a young girls life. It is about a choice she made and how it affected her life.Very well done , a family movie."
1,Very Depressing,"Someone needs to mention that this story is about death. Every time she turns around - the one she loves - dies. It is a very depressing movie. She has one death after another to deal with. Yes, she keeps her faith with God. That does not take away from the fact that she has a very hard life to live because of all the death that follows her."
3,Flawed but memorable for its theme,"Although the movie was way too long, I guess that goes along with the theme, patience. Memorable love story/ies and fairly good acting, but especially fine theme of hanging in there with God through all of life's trials (Though none go with me, still I will follow. No turning back. No turning back.) The biggest flaw (apart from the awful wig on Cheryl Ladd's beautiful head)SPOILER ALERT is that the grandmother seems to be ""rewarded"" for sticking it out with husband #1(aka love #2) by getting back together with love #1. It does seem to diminish her husband's perfectly timed last words, ""Thank you... for choosing me."""
1,Disappointed after the first two books,"I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, but was totally disappointed with this book. I loved the location and descriptions having recently visited the area. However, I disliked the plot just couldn't hold my interest. Felt that Michael's personality change was never explained to my liking and wanted to see the development of his character continue. I belong to a lot of discussion on line lists and have recommended the first and second books, but have not recommended this one."
5,Absolutely wonderful page-turner!,"This is the third in the series that began with ""The Strange Files of Fremont Jones."" And it's amazing! It does everything you want a mystery to do. It's even better than the first two of the series, which I would have thought were impossible to top. This hard-to-put-down book is a superb read. Fremont's and Michael's characters continue to evolve, as does their relationship. And the ancillary characters are so much fun! Dianne Day absolutely sets up a world of time and place and mood and drops us in it. This has instantly become one of my all-time favorite reads -- mystery or otherwise. I'm not kidding! More! More!"
5,Day's concerns are about culture and change.,"Dianne Day's literary concerns are about the nature of cultural change in the U.S. just after the turn of the century. The time of the sertting is significant -- the horse & buggy are about to give 'way to the motor car. Mirroring that is her protagonist, Fremont Jones', natural feminist sensibility --and way ahead of her time. Day is an entertaining writer, yes, but she uses the mystery genre to examine serious, major themes. She is among the very best contemporary novelists and deserves a wide audience."
1,1 star for 1 channel received,"This device is totally useless. Here in Ithaca, NY I receive dozens of channels of purely abstract black and white noise. In addition, I get one fuzzy but watchable channel, FOX, due to the station being 1.3 miles away. And, if I adjust the angle just right, I can sort of make out what's on TBN.Antennaweb conservatively predicts 14 channels recieved from my street address. In contrast, my new Magnavox Mant-400 delivers a total of ONE channel, or 7% of the conservative estimate.It can't even pick up the ABC station that is just 3.5 miles away. All I see I see is black and white noise- not even a glimpse or hint of any recognizable image. And I live on the 4th story of a tower with windows on two walls.I want a refund!"
1,Waste of Time and $$$$$$$$,I bought this thinking it sounded really great(super-amplifier; who wouldn't be impressed by that name).Boy was I ever wrong!I live in socal and get just about ZERO reception.Going to try to get it returned to try something else. If something works better I will recommend something instead of this one on the Big River.Don't choose this one!
3,Steve Allen's first mystery...,"""The Talk Show Murders"" by Steve Allen was his first mystery book, written in 1982, and features a P.I named Roger Dale, as Steve tells us the events of the Talk Show Murders. Dale finds himself sucked in finding the brazen killer who kills talk show guests from under everyone's nose. Dale finds himself mroe frustrated as the body count piles up, and the FBI gets more persistent on him dropping the case. Finally, Dale and the FBI decide to work together for the book's climax, a mega-talk special. Allen does a good job, but it feels a bit empty as we don't get to see as much as the killer's motive as we want."
1,NOT a Lakewood P25 - not even close!,"UPDATE: I ordered this product and it is definitely NOT a Lakewood P25. The original Lakewood, now aka Airking and Lasco, had a really heavy duty motor and 3 large aluminum blades that really moved a lot of air. This 9723 is a very poor made-in-china imitation with 5 wimpy little plastic blades that move about half the air. If you are looking for a real P25 you will have to find one in inventory somewhere because Lakewood went out of business (filed for bankruptcy) a while back and now Sunbeam has purchased the brand names. You can bet Sunbeam will morph them into even cheaper products so if you do run across a P25 in inventory somewhere you should buy 2."
1,Don't order from cosmeticmall.com,Real rating is NO STARS![...] substituted a [...] plastic drugstore fan. Unable to get ahold of [...]for return. Don't buy from this seller!
3,Not exactly what I had been looking for,"I purchased this product because I could not find an exact replacement for the one I had. My old one had spring loaded,removable brushes, which could be washed and re-installed. Also a counter which told you when that should be done and the cleaning process timed out at 30 seconds and automatically re-set. It was quickly worn out as I have five VCR's. This one serves the purpose and is a ""wet"" system. I don't use dry systems as I have found them to be abrasive. Shipping was a bit slow but packaging was good."
3,Good Information,Very usefull to drive yourself and your team. Good to keep at the office for reference and pull out to check progress.
2,Old model,"Dish Network couldn't activate it even sent me new cards,but no dice. Anyone like to buy it? make me an offer."
2,It Could Have Been Good...,I hate to criticize this movie for it has elements about it that I really liked. Lots of swearing if you don't like that. I enjoyed some of the characters especially Indiria Varma who I would like to see more of. I liked some of the locations they visited too.But don't get carried away with the liner notes comparing it to 22 Day Later. Not in the same league. This one is humourous throughout and the connection between the dog virus and the main story line is very weak. I would rate this closer to Brazil or Left Behind than 22 Days Later.
4,Cao Italia,Good book. I like the presentations. There are many recipes I will try but some I won't because I don't eat that kind of food.
2,Maxell 723440 48CL AA Batteries,I buy off-brand AA & AAA batteries in 50 or 100 packs; especially since everything my grandchildren play with requires batteries. I bought Rayovac & Sears brand before not expecting a real-long life; but they did fairly well. I never expected a company like Maxell to make such a lousy short-life battery. They don't even last as long as off-brands. I won't buy them again; I can tell you that much.Rev K.C.L. Sr.
5,Great,I was skeptical at this price but was pleased with new sealed batteriesas stated and they work great !!!Lee
3,It's Annoying,"If you don't like doing lunges, don't by this because there is a section where all you do is lunges for what seems like eternity!"
4,Hands Down a WORKOUT!,"This workout dvd is so intense, you will have to pause it in the first session of lunges. If you want an ultimate workout- this is it. Wear some extra clothes, or what not and you'll be dripping sweat before you know it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because if you have bad knees, this might not work. Otherwise, this is a workout DVD to keep!~!"
3,Outstanding action!,This is an outstanding book because there is suspense and action. People who love mysteries would also enjoy this book. I would nominate this book for an award!
2,.....,"i'm not all the way through this book, but at this point i don't even wanna finish it. it's not a bad book, but it's kind of boring and slow moving. i liked annette curtis klause's other books much better."
1,alien secrets,"This book is about a girl who gets expelled from boarding school on Earth and is on her way to live with her parents in a weird planet in outer space. She leaves on a big space ship and there are many ghosts and screams coming from an object called the Soo. There is a theif trying to steal the Soo and nobody knows who it is .The girl is trying to find out who the thief is. I don't recommend this book to people who don't like science fiction. Everything is make believe and silly. Maybe a younger reader, aged 11-13 might like it."
2,Not near as good as the former Risk I had for Win 95...,I wish I knew what the JC in the title stood for. I thought this was an improvement on the Win 95 version of Risk I had years ago. This one isn't nearly as user friendly or fun.
4,Excellent game to pass the time...,"This is a very good, although somewhat dated, strategy game. Since it is a little older, the AI (artificial intelligence, i.e., the computer) is very good but probably not up to par with more modern strategy games. However, because I played this game when I was a kid (so many times I lost track) I still enjoy it. In addition, the game music (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture) is quite appropriate! The game has the Classic version of Risk and a Simultaneous version where all players attack at the same time; I haven't tried this version yet. My computer is running Microsoft XP with Service Pack 2 and the game runs fine with no glitches. If you are a die-hard Risk fan I believe you will enjoy the game for quite a while."
4,Solid Game,"If you like playing the board game you will love this game. It does the work of counting your armies for you and you won't have to ""make change"" any more! You have the pleasure of being able to play a game against computer opponents and can easily save a game and resume it later. I like Tournament mode where you try to accomplish specific missions and progress to higher levels doing so."
3,Good Game if you like Risk,"I bought this game for my husband. I think he played with it a bit, though he's not much a fan of Risk I think"
3,Risk II review,"This game is fairly consistent with the original board game, play is pretty close to the same. Execution, however is a little bit ""iffy"" in that the cursor tends to disappear, making it difficult to locate."
5,Lovely saddle,I love this saddle! Its comfy and sits me correctly. Had a broke in feeling in no time. I'm not a fan of knee rolls but on this saddle your knees just sink right into them b/c of the airflow blocks. Its great for schooling or show. I would highly recommened this saddle.
1,Hmmm...This should be in the fiction catagory.,"What an honor it is to be the first reveiwer for this piece of ...whatever!I've read some the excerpts from this work of fiction and I must say...This man should never be allowed to touch a baseball again. This is just another blatant way for Pete to raise money and to peddle his ""legacy"". I can just picture him sitting down with his accountant and ""personalizing"" this rag while mentally ringing up the sales.Pete's numbers should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame but the man (and I use that term VERY loosely) is a disgrace.Give it up Pete...this will be the last nail in your coffin.We be givin' ol' Petey boy a -10 mojo*z for lyin' again!"
2,Not a Historical Replica,"This looks like a Windlass Steel pseudo-Roman design. The back of the helmet neck guard should not have the bulbous shape. The helmet seems to be a fantasy mixture of Italic and Gallic styles. The brass eyebrows are wrong, the brow guard is wrong. The cheekguards are wrong. The Horsehair crest should have a wooden crestbox, not a metal one, and if it is a Centurions creat it would be worn across, transversly, not from front to back. This crest holder shown would need modifications to make that work at all. It is NOT a CENTURION style helmet crest.This helmet is not an actual recreation of any currently known Roman helmet. It is not usable for Roman re-enactors. It is okay for Hollywood and theater, and fantasy LARPS and costumes.For more information on Roman Helmets look for ""Roman Military Equipment (2nd edition)"" by Coulston and Bishop, or even the old classic ""Armour of Imperial Rome"" by Robinson. Run a search at Amazon.com for 'Roman Military Equipment'."
5,Quite a bargain,I picked up these binoculars to use as low cost spotting scopes for range target practice. The fit and finish isn't as good as you'll find on a high end pair but these aren't bad either. They feel pretty good in the hand and the image is bright and clear. I've used these now in both winter and summer and I am very happy with these binoculars.
2,Very Fragile,"These are very inexpensive so I expected everything to be made of plastic, BUT they made the arms that support the eyepieces extremely thin and brittle. Out of the box I notice an odd distortion that could not be fixed with focus and within a few moments the left eyepiece popped right off. I don't know if it was damaged in shipping or if it was a defect. Once it came off the first thing I noticed was just how thin the eyepiece support is.These might be good if you only plan to use them on vacation, you might consider them disposable because they are so cheap. Just be very gentle. I have other binos from Celestron that I'm very happy with, these are just a bit too cheap for their own good."
1,not even a year old...,"If there was a zero star to give I would give it. This product was barely used, maybe used it 5 or 6 times and just tried to use it tonight and it could not focus anything. It broke my heart to realize that the focus knob was just turning loosely and the lenses just would not budge.I cant explain it since I did not drop it and since I barely used it. So my advice to anyone looking for a product that will stand the test of time...LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! this one is not it"
2,arrived defective,"The right eyepiece has an adjustment that was impossible to focus. Unfortunate, because the view looked great out of the left side that had no independent adjustment on the eyepiece."
2,not my style,"The UpClose line of products so far is very convenient great product with great price!I own the 8x40 (I needed these binoculars for a natural history course in my college, mostly for birding) which I love and I wanted to try the 10x50 which I didn't like at all.Beside the fact I received them damaged I was disappointed to discover the zoom function which I'm not a big fan of. I have try other binoculars of several brands and all the ones with this function pretty much ruined the overall usage experienceAny way I return the 10x50 and order the Celestron 71133 UpClose 10x25 Roof Prism Binocular which I haven't receive yet but I believe it will be better then the 10x50."
1,No Joy From Celestron,"I ordered a pair of Celestron 71137 10x50 binoculars from Celstron's website. They arrived broken.After trying and failing to get a return merchandise authorization online, I finally spent the required 15 minutes on hold to be allowed to speak to a customer service rep with poor English on the other side of the world. He did manage to get a RMA emailed to me with a UPS label and lots of instructions telling me to send the return package to a different address than the one on the UPS label. I flipped a coin, and used the UPS label and returned the binoculars. UPS tracking shows that the binoculars were received by Celestron at their loading dock and signed for. Celestron does not acknowledge having received them so no repair, replacement or refund.If I had bought the binoculars from Amazon all this would never have happened. Live and learn.P.S. After not hearing anything from Celestron for three weeks, I did receive a replacement pair one month after returning the broken set."
2,Product review,"I purchased the 10 X 50's to use while hunting, I hunt in Germany and they come in handy for the distance, the price was good but I was disappointed with the quality, they have double images and they fogged up a lot and then they fell apart. They have a nice field of view but again they fell apart and had to ""screw"" them back together. So, makes it difficult when you try to see an animal at 200 meters away. I am not sure that I would buy this product again."
4,nice product,"I love these binoculars, I take them everywhere and I highly recommend for the price, the quality is great - the only downside for me personally is that I find them too heavy to hand around my neck - but they are wonderful! I use them to look at summer constellations and for occasional sightseeing, they work perfectly"
4,Good Binoculars for terrestrial viewing,"I bought this binoculars in mint condition through Amazon.com sent from Coffeyville, KS fulfillment center. A good binoculars far better than my terrestrial telescope of focal ratio 15. It is a best outdoor equipment recommended for first time buyers, easy to carry with a sturdy look, though it's slightly difficult to hold for several minutes as the hands are aching. This made me decide selling my old telescope. Such a great and excellent optics. I highly suggest buying this model instead of the low power binoculars coming under the samebrand."
4,Pleasantly surprised !,When I ordered these I was looking for a general purpose glasses that would give good variety of focal ranges. I took a chance on these because of price (not too much invested if they didn't work out) I am well pleased with these!A great product for the price. They work extremely well at all focal lenghts and I made a good buy.P.S I don't think you should write a review if your glasses arrive already broken.A bad Break for the buyer but more of shippers fault than product.
4,DownRiver CD -- O Nach Eisdeadh,Heard this song on my car radio and loved it so much i was compelled to pull over to make sure i got the title and artist. her voice and this music resonate on a cellular level.
3,NOT HD DVD!,"WARNING. This is not an HD DVD. It is a standard definition DVD. I ordered it and it has a regular DVD logo on the label and it plays on my standard DVD player. It says on the back ""Produced in stunning high definition"", which I'm sure it was, as are many films and documentaries. But it wasn't released in high definition."
3,First Time Mom ~nt,Some helpful information enclosed but mostly just a simple relaxing book to read.The pages have large print and you can breeze through this. Got a few good tips but not as many as I thought I would get when I started reading this book.
5,Great Product,"This is a great shirt. I get looks no matter where I go with this shirt. It is really high quality and very durable, not to mention really sharp and funny."
1,Absolutely Awful,"All these amazing reviews I was sure I'd found the best product in self tan. This stuff goes on instantly which is nice, the color is good and the smell is nice but there is no permanence to this stuff. I did all kinds of things to make sure I was totally dry and everything and the tan stuff still got over everything I had. Also I got splashed by water and it instantly came off. I really tried every trick convinced I was doing something wrong with all these amazing reviews but seriously have never found a more useless self tanner. I noticed the tanners it was being compared to and I also tried those as well. Of all the MANY MANY tanners I have tried St. Tropez (step 3 lotion) is by far the best one."
5,No other case deserves my gear's trust,"I've used plenty of subpar cases that claim to be as good as Pelicans. Now I will trust nothing but a genuine Pelican to protect my camera system while traveling. I use the pluck foam included to form-fit space in the case for each piece of gear.I can't say enough good things about the quality of the case build; it's exactly how I would build a case if I had the time, knowledge, and equipment.Bottom line: The Pelican has taken the abuse so my cherished gear doesn't get damaged. Ever. Period."
5,Jesus how many freakin words do you need to say something is goodmg,what can you say the Pelican product is always a great product they want you to write 18 words written or less kind of stupid cause of the world my back is the but just trying to explain to you that this is a good product and you don't need 18 worst say great product somebody with some brains out to get in charge and get rid of some the dumbasses are running the show by the damn product is worth every penny
1,A big disapppointment,"This book looks so beautiful and appealing and I see that the other reviews at amazon.com are good. However, I'm writing this a few hours before a Chanukah party, and I've just tossed out my second try at Dreidl cake, which my little boy is dying to have for our party. I've followed all the directions, but the cake falls apart after it's inverted after 15 minutes of cooling (as directed by the recipe) If it falls apart, it can't be cut into a dreidl shape. The first time I let it cool 15 minutes; the second time, 20 minutes. Now I'm going to try to let it cool completely before inverting but it may not be ready by party time. So I'm baking chocolate chip cookies as a backup. If there is some special trick to making this cake, I wish the author would have written it into the book. Whatever it is, it's not fast and it's not easy if you have to figure out the trick by trial and error."
4,One of My Select Few,"I'm not an early vocal music enthusiast, in the sense that I don't own a large collection of recordings in that vein and am certainly no expert -- indeed, I am the most layman-y of laymen when it comes to this kind of music, but I know what I like, and Crecquillon is one of those composers of the time and genre whose works I listen to, and this disc is part of my regular rotation. While I can't contribute meaningfully to the ""Shawn and Dulcian"" discussion started by another reviewer, I can testify that I find both the music and the renditions on this album quite utterly gorgeous. In passing, I'd also recommend a two-volume set on the Arsis label by the Choir of the Church of the Advent, Boston, that is also exquisite. A vigorous thumbs up, however, for the Brabant Ensemble."
2,Dissappointed,"Bob Mathias, to me, is a great figure in the history of international sports. He has led an interesting life. However, I found this book to be slow and boring and frankly, I think the Mathias story is much more exciting than is displayed here. I have read other books and stories that show the spirit, determination, and accomplishments of a great man, in a much better light.John FrancisLos Angeles, CA"
2,a mixed pakage,"the mp3 player is ok in general when you first get the DMP310 it works great but over time and a little abuse and i do mean a little abuse it starts to randomly freaze, freaze when the batteries are low, or when you bump into something. for something that has no moving parts why does it freaze?the good aspects to the DMP310 is that it has a good battery life and good audio quality, but these things dont fully make up for the draw backs and flaws that i previusly stated."
2,Decent MP3 Player - poor hardware,"As an MP3 Player, it works well. However I've had some problems with it: Occassionally the computers it's attached to don't recognize it - or even delete all content off of it (not fun), also I've just had a button break. On the whole it's good functionally - but doesn't appear to be of high-quality construction."
3,Worth the price,"I am basically satisfied with DMP-310. It does what it says. Only one problem, it does not allow you to arrange your own play list. It doesn't support m3u. Even you group the mp3 files into different folders, this player will sort all the files according to the file names. So you can't jump between different albums. Hope gateway can fix this by upgrading firmware."
1,Self-regarding Gripes about Academe,"This book teems with complaints about academia as self-regarding as they are trivial. There are plenty of important things to criticize about contemporary academe but it's safe to say Caesar fails to hit a single one. Instead he wastes his venom and our time on gripes (in so many words) like: 'department memos ars stupid,' 'writing dissertations suck,' 'it's a bitch not knowing why you didn't get a grant you applied for.' Sour grapes, all. And no important or trenchant criticism to speak of. Avoid this one."
1,Not universal for all Recurve Bows...,"I paid $13 (Shipping included) for this recurve bow stringer... The first thing I saw when I opened its package were instructions along with a fine print that said the product may not fit all recurves, don't use this product if limbs dont fit in the pockets... Sadly enough, my Martin Jaguar Recurve Takedown bow's limbs could not fit in the pockets of the stringer... Honestly I don't think 90% of the recurve bows' limbs out there can fit in the pocket of this stringer. I feel like it's meant for really REALLY thin bow limbs, possibly junior bows...Do NOT buy this product, it's better to find and spend slightly more money on one with deeper, bigger, limb pockets. Forcing yourself to use this product and make your bow fit in the pockets is a high risk and can cause injury to you as well as damage your bow."
2,This product sucks,This product works for getting a bow string off but it's impossible to put a string on!Get the bow stringer that has the rubber piece instead of two end pieces
3,Lacks something,"It's not a bad product, as far as providing extra protein. It tastes good and does not have a gritty aftertaste/texture. However, be careful about consuming it on an entirely empty stomach - for some reason (maybe the almost complete lack of carbs in the product), if you drink it on an empty stomach it will bottom out your energy level. I'd recommend having it with a carb-providing snack or a meal."
3,Great Product Awful price,"You can get these at most discount retailers like the big one W or T for 5$ for a four pack which is almost half of amazon's price... shame on you amazon, you usually do very well with competitive pricing. For this to be worth it to me - you'd have to sell it for around ten bucks or so maybe 12 but no more...."
2,NOT worth the price,this short article says all the same things commonly found on the net--It is Not worth the price!
2,"Cheap, but cheap","You get what you pay for. The sound is low and as bad as I've ever heard from a set of ear buds. The cord is the shortest I've seen, so don't buy this if you keep your player in a pant pocket. I use this set as a deep backup only. Not recommended."
1,GARBAGE!!,"I made the terrible mistake of purchasing these headphones, and as a professional audio person I can tell you, these headphones are the worst piece of crap I've heard in my life.The ""specifications"" say the frequency response is 20 htz to 20.000 htz, but I have the feeling the top is more like 8 htz, because the sound is so dull and distorted, it sounds like listening radio or telephone.If you enjoy music, do not buy these headphones, they are terrible!! Even if you have to pay 10 or 20 or even 30 dollars more, buy something else."
2,2.5 stars,"I was looking for a pair of simple ear buds and found these at a big box store for $5 (""Model PL-1""). I trust the Maxell name from prior experience with their excellent tapes, and the package had a quality appearance so I took a chance. The cord length measures 40"", which is fine for me. The L-plug looks sturdy enough to withstand extended use. (They don't include foam earpads.) So they get points for construction. The sound, on the other hand- not so much. They aren't quite the worst sounding I've heard, but close. The sound isn't unbearable but it is tinny with virtually no base, and has a little reverb, like a radio playing in a shower. That isn't fatal for me as I'm not using them for music but rather for talk stations, and the speakers' voices are clear enough. The Amazon price of $2.99 is closer to what they are worth as back-ups that wouldn't get you upset if lost. For $5 to $9 you can get much better sounding ear buds."
3,good for the price,"My husband suffers from some kind of mysterious broken headphone curse, so I've become somewhat of an expert in comparing brands. The sound quality this set of ear buds provides is not excellent, but it's slightly better than average for ear buds within its price range. The sound range is better than average, but don't expect a super clean sound or deep bass. The buds are comfortable to wear. One drawback, however, is the unusually short cord, which can be annoying if you're using them at the computer (or if you're a tall person with your iPod in your pocket). To make matters worse, the rubbery cord tends to naturally crinkle up, making itself even shorter. All in all, for a set of cheap ear buds, this is not a bad buy."
5,Excellent collection,"I recently read ""The Shadow Cage"" by Philippa Pearce, who of course is perhaps best known forTom's Midnight Garden.This is a collection of ten slightly creepy tales for middle-grade readers. Moderately tame, compared to what is published for this age group today (this book dates from 1977), but very satisfying. Reading this reminded me that I really should look up more of the author's work. I'll give this a solid recommendation for kids who enjoy supernatural stories.The book is superbly illustrated with ink wash sketches by Ted Lewin. I have some other books that have been illustrated by this artist, and his work is fantastic; I really like it. Here, I'll upload a few examples from this book to Amazon.The stories included in this book are:1. The Shadow Cage2. Miss Mountain3. Guess4. At the River Gates5. Her Father's Attic6. The Running-Companion7. Beckoned8. The Dear Little Man with His Hands in His Pockets9. The Dog Got Them10. The Strange Illness of Mr Arthur Cook"

2,Not worth the money,"Liguaphone Thai was a big waste of money. It comes with two books. One has the vocabulary; the other has the exercises. The cd's only cover the excercises and not all the words in the vocabulary are covered. Moverover, I have a Thai friend-- who helps me with my Thai every now and again. He said some of the Thai that was taught was not correct (not a lot of it, but why learn even some of the language incorrectly). The english phonics pronunciation is hard to understand because they list ""g"" sounds as ""k"" and ""th"" or ""dt"" sounds as ""t.""The course is very, very boring. I gave it 2 stars because one could learn Thai using this course. Though, that would take a very dedicated person.The best course I have found is Pimsleur. I learned a lot of the basics in a short amount of time. A.U.A Thai is also a good course, but it is only for the serious student."
5,Wonderfully Refreshing Science Fiction,"The ideas presented in this book are interesting and engaging; it's the first science fiction book I've read in a while that didn't feel like a transcribed version of a cheesy space action movie. The focus is not on needless action or fancy gadgets, but rather how society is transformed by technology.The setup is as follows: two key technologies, a device that can transmit data instantaneously and a brain-computer interface combine to create robots that human beings remotely pilot as if they where in their bodies. The continued advancement of this technology begins to tear basic social fabrics as the line between physical and virtual blurs."
2,Disappointed in Rubbermaid,"My husband and I bought this storage shed because it was the size we needed, and the Rubbermaid label made us think it would be a quality item. It took us four hours to assemble it, and it was extremely difficult. We've assembled lots of things before (to save money)and it's usually no big deal, but this was the absolute worst. Some sections of this storage unit -- particularly the roof and the door hinges -- required a lot of brute force to get the parts to fit together, and it would have been impossible for one person. We plan to caulk various sections because we have no confidence that the storage unit's construction will keep out the rain or snow. Also, a drill is required (but not mentioned in the instructions) because there are no pilot holes for some sections. We are disappointed in this Rubbermaid product. For the price we paid, this should have been a quality item!"
5,Beats and warlords,"The other review for this album prefaces that they don't like dnb, then they give this album a low rating. You have to wonder why they are reviewing it.This is a great drum and bass album, with plenty of color thrown in. Their title track is my favorite, combining plenty of ancient battle movie samples for an epic and driving feel. The beats and bass themselves are well composed, for almost a mix of soundtrack meets drill. Very well done, highly recommended, and a high place in my collection. Provides an excellent soundtrack to my daily work."
2,Norwegian breakbeats,"If you're into quick, hard breakbeating; this is your thing. This is for the hardcore listener, or perhaps dancer. It's angry music. Cool enough for me, I'm not the d&b guy, but I love the track called September. It's worth the entire album. Check it out! It gives me that good floating sensation, whilst keeping the beats. For short: chords, breakbeats, kind of banjo-sound, vocals. Again: check it out!"
3,Decent value for the price,"This is a good Bluetooth for the money. It doesn't always pick up my voice clearly, and it has a tendency to slip out of your ear after you've used it for a while. I wouldn't say I'm very impressed, but it is a good value for the money."
2,Sounds Good but Poorly Built Ear Hook!!!,This was a good buy. I love using the ear piece for driving and walking around the house. My only complaint is that the ear hook breaks whenever you need to charge it. The reason for this is because you need to remove the ear hook in order to charge it and this is when the ear hook snaps. Poorly crafted! This is why I can not recommend this product. Save your money and buy something else with a piece that won't break all the time.
1,"Great product, the one I was sent was Faulty","This product is great, I bought it as a replacement for one that I had lost. It's small, has a long battery life and fits well inside my ear. However, the item that I was supplied is completely useless as the battery life was around 10 minutes. Value was too low to bother to return this, so it was a waste of money. Shame."
2,WEP 200 Different Versions?,"I've actually had 3 of these (I lose things). They seem to have different sub-models. The first, and last one I bought do not work well with the commands on my Blackberry Curve, specifically the voice dial. The 2nd one worked perfectly and had better sound quality. The last one I ordered was like the first one. I see no way to reprogram the button to work any differently."
2,Difficult enough to read without the errors,"This book, while educational, is written in a difficult to read manner. Additionally, the book is full of editing errors which makes things even more difficult. I'm surprised that any professor would choose this text for his/her course."
2,Confusing,This book does not do a good job of prepping you to solve the problems. Authors can be confusing at times.
2,Better Pay Attention In Class!,Compared to all the other text books I've used this one is aweful. It is outdated and very poorly organized. Good luck if you have to teach yourself this inforamtion- better pay attention in class!
1,Not a good textbook,"This book does not have good explanations or examples. When explaining information, they use too much of their own terminology, which can be very confusing if you don't understand that terminology."
1,Only for those who speak Accountanteese,"Terrible. That's my take on this book. It has the right format, plenty of nice stories and case studies. But where it really counts -- explaining the nitty gritty so that anyone can understand it -- this book fails miserably. I couldn't follow along with half of the things I read. I read them again and again and still no luck. It might help if they used plain English and re-wrote some of their Where's-my-glossary verbage. And half the time the Exhbits they refer to are on separate pages from the text that explains it. You have to flip and flip and flip. Too often they don't explain crucial steps carefully enough, assuming that the reader can follow along. These guys know what they're talking about, but they've obviously haven't been a student for a very long time. It shows."
1,The worst textbook I've ever had!!!,"This book is terrible in addition to being ridiculously expensive ($108 to be exact). I had to buy it for an MBA course in Managerial Accounting and found it to be extremely confusing, without structure and ambiguous. There are numerous errors, omissions, and the examples are not clear at all. It's really too bad such a poor text was chosen because I am certain that others, like myself, have been turned off of management accounting forever. It's too bad because management accounting is such an integral part of business and deserves much better attention, and clarity than this book provides. I can't wait to ""try"" to sell this one. Definitely not a keeper! If you have to buy this book for your course, I truly empathize with you."
5,good job,I made an order for a used text book. Amazon was the least expensive. I recieved the book in a timely fashion with an e-mail confirmation and a tracking number. The world is right.
