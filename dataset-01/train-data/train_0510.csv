1,The gold one tarnished...,... after wearing it just twice. It is not true vermeil - gold-plated silver. It looks more like cheap metal underneath.Not worth it.
5,Eminently useful!,"Great selection of sizes! Excellent quality, beautifully packaged. Arrived quickly. Would definitely deal with this vendor again!"
4,sterling silver necklace extenders,Arrived quickly and it was just what I wanted!! I was very pleased with thiain.s company and will definitely do business with them again.
3,extenders,Merchandise took much too long for delivery! - 3 weeks too long after promised date. Elaborate packaging for item.Book ordered on the same day came very promptly.
4,50's SCIFI movie combo,"If you enjoy fun, entertaining and visually satisfying science fiction, then this combo is no disappointment. Cream of the crop 1950's movies here. There's a lot of effort in the visuals in these films. And these films don't need gore to hold your attention. Most everyone over 40 years old knows these films and appreciate the quality of workmanship for the time they were produced. Every member of the family can enjoy these classics. The price for this combo is reasonable in my opinion. I can finally retired my VHS versions."
3,Film Review,"As a kid, I loved listening to Orson Wells' infamous Halloween broadcast. I could not resist the chance to pick up this film. It's sure not the highest-budget film ever made, but is exciting to watch as the eventual demise of the Martians is well-known to anyone who ever heard, read or viewed any version of this classic tale."
1,Awful,"It must be me, I like technothrillers which are technically accurate. The story is really hard to believe and it is hard to imagine that everything from a nuclear torpedo to a kamikaze vs. a cruise missile would really happenPerhaps the worst part though for someone who likes their technothrillers accurate are all the misstatements. It says there's a Mark 49 and Mark 50 heavyweight torpedo. Mark 50 is already the name of a lightweight one.then, there is this piranha class submarine. Why say this as though it were really a class of US submarine? Also, the note that US submarines don't use anechoic tiles. How could this be. Read jane's. The list goes on. From plot to accuracy, it's awfu"
4,Learn how to hit longer drives,"In Swing Easy Hit Hard, you will see just how you have to swing to hit a long ball. Basically you have to pull down with your left hand (right handers) and bring your hands down to nearly level with the ball position while keeping your left hand facing down and your right hand facing up. If you do this with a light grip and an easy swing, the clubhead will release from about 4' away in the same time it takes your hands to move the next 6"" or about 8 times as fast. It is this speed increase just before hitting the ball that gives you a long drive.For years, I was forcing the swing by a grip that was too tight. I was also doing too much with my hands with the result that my drives were seldom longer than 170 yards. You can't force a long drive, you have to let it happen with an easy swing.The book has lots of pictures so you can see just how it is done and Boros explains it very well. Wish I had read it 30 years sooner.All of this and the price is right."
2,Ho Hum,"I was not exactly thrilled with the first book in this trilogy but thought I would buy this one to see what happened to the the middle brother, Rick. I found myself skipping pages that were just filled with blah, blah, blah. It seemed that pages keep repeating ""thoughts"" of both major characters: How she had trouble settling and trusting. Over and over... I am not sure I will get this one finished and not even going to bother buying the next one. I just don't care enough about what happens. Carly Phillips has written many books that I love but this series is below par. Save your money..."
2,Immature,"It might be because the audiobook actor was over-the-top in his reading, but I couldn't finish the book. It was painfully immature, which surprised me because Carly Phillips newer books are better."
5,"no pics here! read it for the ""articles""!",I really enjoyed this book. i was given the 1st in the series and i immediately purchased the other 2. they are fun relateable books.
4,Easy read,"This Is an easy quick read. I just dislike the ending of this book. The author spends so much time building up the relationship, t by ending the book just ends. So frustrating"
4,Oh those sexy Chandler men!,"This is a second of a three book series. (Make sure you read The Bachelor first. The Playboy gives away the ending to the Bachelor). I thought the first book was good, but this one was even better. It's a story of love with a lot of ups and downs. Will they get thogether or won't they? (I'll never tell!)The side stories that are laced through this book and the last one are fun, too! I can't wait to read The Heartbreaker (the third book)."
4,A Very Predictable Ending,In my opion this book was nice and warm but a bit predictable. Unlike the first book in Phillips's collection it did not fluctuate as much. Rick and Kendal had their ups and downs but not enough to make this book THAT interesting. I would suggest this book for a vacation or a plane ride. It is also a nice and warm book with a fairy tale ending. Obviously at the end of the 3rd book of the trilogy Chase and Salone will end up together. This series is just too predictable for me.
3,Disappointed,"I picked up this book after reading all the rave reviews and I guess it must be me, because I certainly can't say I loved it. The storyline was pretty good and I really liked the characters but had enough of Kendall's constant hashing back and forth as to whether or not she could commit to staying put. That seemed to be a third of the book and it got old really fast."
1,..shallow!!,"Let me start by saying that I didn't even finish this book, so take this review with that in mind.I am an avid romance reader and one of the main reasons that I like to read this genre is because I enjoy watching a romance develop between two individuals. This book gives ""quickie"" and all new meaning.The main two characters meet and fall in lust immediately. It only takes, what, ummmm 4 chapters and they are in the sack. Not my idea of romance. The idea that these 2 shallow individuals were actually able to ""fall in love"" so quickly seemed ludacris to me. Lust maybe, but enough to last... I think not. I just didn't buy that a confirmed bachelor could see a woman in a wedding dress with pink hair and be ready to head to the alter, (or at least the bedroom). I made it through 5 chapters and that was all I could stomach. This book just wasn't for me. I like emotional depth, charater development, and a worthwhile premise to the story. This book failed to deliver in all of these areas."
3,Second n the Chandler trilogy,"Officer Rick Chandler will do anything to avoid his mother's matchmaking schemes. As well as those of the well meaning townspeople, who seem to want this divorced man hooked up again.When he rescues a runaway bride fleeing from her wedding, he hatches an ingenious plan - he has Kendall Sutton pose as his intended to keep the rest of the single ladies who constantly resort to placing erroneous 911 calls to get his attention at bay. She agrees, as it will keep her off the meat market as well. Of course neither counts on falling for the other.Phillips follow up to ""The Bachelor"" is actually more lightweight than the first offering, with an incredible lack of depth and undeveloped characters. But there is plenty of steam to keep the reader turning the pages, and Phillips infuses some pretty funny situations into this installment (the scene in the beauty shop is hysterical)."
1,Save you money!!!!,"I was so excited when I ordered this product!!! When I got it today I could have CRIED!!! There are NO TOOLS, BEADING WIRE, OR COLORFUL PENDANTS!!! Also there are not enough beads of one color/type to make ANYTHING. The boxes are made of cheap flimsy plastic and the carrier feels litke it will break everytime I open it. THIS PIECE OF JUNK IS GOING BACK TODAY!!!!! Be warned!!!The only reason it got one star is because you HAVE to rate the products..."
1,remote does not work,The light was installed easily but I was very disappointed when it became clear the remote did not work. I have to turn the light on and off manually. The remote will work sometimes if I get within 6 inches of the light so what is the use of the remote. I know it should not work because I have 2 other lights like this one and they work fine.
2,This book didn't help me,"This book does an interesting job of describing the problem, but don't buy this book thinking that it will tell you how to lose weight. As the author says on page 124, ""There is no safe, effective, and proven way to lose weight. . . . I believe that most cases of abdominal obesity, and perhaps most cases of any kind of obesity, can be traced back to chronic infections. If this is correct, then the best way to fight obesity will be to fight chronic infections. This is, needless to say, an unproven theory."" The author holds out the hope that in the future, sophisticated medical treatment will be available. For now, the author recommends reducing stressors: avoid alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, air travel, television, etc. The author also recommends some changes that are easier said than done: marry the right person, live within your means, trust God, and so on. And if you have depression, get that cured somehow. None of this advice has actually made my potbelly any smaller."
4,Great coat rack,"I've had this coat rack for a few days and am loving it. It's very stable and does not wobble at all. I have put lots of heavy winter coats on it both adult and child and it holds them just fine. Someone mentioned having to evenly balance coats on this rack and I haven't had a problem with that. I actually have left one side free for company without problems. The instructions could be a little better. Basically it's just a picture with lots of arrows and you have to figure it out for yourself but once you get what's going on in the picture it's a snap to put together. Literally my 8 year old put the majority of it together once we knew what to do.I got the sandy black which is basically an ashy or slighted faded black.I'm not sure how big a difference there is between black and sandy black. For me, the color looks great in my foyer and goes well with my banister. All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
5,Nice,I was looking for a coat rack for a reasonable price. This item fits the bill. It is sturdy and looks nice.
1,Not too good,I had to put a shim under the legs to make it stand straight. The center poll also is very weak where it screws in.
1,Cheap Coat Rack,"My wife and I were very disappointed with this product. First, when you attempt to screw in the hooks at the top of the coat rack, your first instinct is to tighten the screws because the hook is still loose. When you do that, you strip the screw (had to use liquid nail to keep hook in place). Second, the coat rack itself is very uneven, it doesn't lay flat on the floor (it wobbles). PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,very pleased!,Coat Rack with umbrella stand came quickly and was easy to put together. Looks great in our entry way. Like the fact that it doesn't take up too much room but holds umbrellas and coats nicely.
5,"attractive storage for hats, umbrellas, and light jackets","I was looking for a nice looking place to conveniently place umbrellas and hats. This piece is very nice looking and sturdy. It was very easy to assemble, and went together in about 5 minutes. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something light duty. I don't think it would stay balanced with heavy coats though."
2,Coat Rack is just ok,"Would be 3 stars if it assembled correctly. 1 of the four racks the coats are supposed to hang on did not assemble properly and 1 of them is very loose. I called Amazon and the seller to try to get a new coat rack or a replacement part. Amazon had no more to ship and noboby could send me a replacement part (it's either a whole new item or nothing). My options were: 1) try to re-package the coat rack back into the box and ship it back for a refund 2) take a % discount for receiving a defective item. I chose #2 just to be done with it.This is the only problem I've ever had ordering through Amazon, but most of my purchases are fairly simple to return if needed. I'll think twice before ordering something like this online again."
1,used coatrack,"very disappointed! coatrack had been put together before! hardware package was open, and screws were loose in the box {one was missing]. ALL THE SCREWS WERE CROSSTHREADED. ALSO, it was scarred and needed touch up paint. i e-mailed the company,but got no response."
2,"Nice looking, poorly built","I'm just moving into a new house, and was determined that we would no longer be draping outerwear over the nearest armchair. I was really excited to get this coat rack... there were, after all, more good reviews than bad....Maybe I just got a bad coat rack. I took it out of the box and discovered it did not sit level. On closer investigation, I found this to be because a piece of one metal foot was missing. And when I screwed the top half on, there was a frighteningly obvious list to one direction, (above and beyond what would have been caused by the missing foot), as if the receiving piece had been machined at an angle.This is a nice looking piece, and I'm sure it fits the bill if everything is in order. This one went back from whence it came"
1,"poor quality, mismatching hardware",I bought this Coat Rack thinking that I'll be able to assemble it quickly. The hardware included in the package does not fit together. Especially attaching the top four hangers to the center rod is painful. Do not buy this.
3,"Looks good, holds a lot. Issues with the assemble hardware.","Bought two of these - one for an apt, one for an office. Looks great, however, the ""arm"" assembly isn't well designed - each arm has a tang that fits into a hole in the post and a hex bolt below that screws into the post. You can't bolt it tight enough to keep the arm from wobbling - snugged it up too tight on one arm and I stripped the bolt. Not going to send it back, though - it looks nice and people notice it."
5,Coat Rack,This is a great coat rack! It was very easy to assemble and looks great in my office! I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Works Great!,"I purchased this to use in my business and so far works great! Super easy to put together...I think it took less than 10 minutes. Looks awesome, too - I have received many compliments on it!"
4,Nice Coat Rack,The coat rack was easy to put together I did it myself. My last rack fell apart but we put too many coats on it as we don't have a coat closet! I have quite a few on this one and so far so good! Seems pretty nice for the money!
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this purchase, doesn't hold much weight. Very good for spring coats Not winter. Have owed this item for a year, currently looking to replace it."
5,Good and Sturdy,Excellent... This is the second one that I have purchased. A relative saw mine and wanted one so bad. I purchased it for her and she loves it! It is of good quality and is nice and sturdy. The rack holds a great deal of coats and doesn't wobble or tip over. VERY easy to assemble. I recommend this product!
1,Junk,Very cheaply made with inferior quality metal. Top hooks alignment pins and holes do not match with screw holes. Arms cannot be tightened without stripping metal holes. Any actual use will result in upper hook arms coming loose in a short time.
2,"Not recommend if you have small children, rack fell over easily.","It was really easy to put together. However, we had jackets hanging only on one side (closest to the door) and the rack fell over and hit the opposite wall and left a really bad scratch. Will have to repair drywall and paint. I thought with the bottom being able to hold umbrellas and with added weight to the bottom of the stand that it would be sturdy and not fall over, it is not sturdy at all (we tried on carpet and wood floor). If only hanging two coats recommend hanging on both sides to avoid it falling over, something to think about if you have small children or animals. With regards to appearance, it does look nice."
3,"Nicely designed , sturdy coat rack.","Needed a coat rack/ umbrella stand to help control clutter in the living room. This one is very sturdy and holds numerous coats, handbags, and umbrellas of all sizes. The only problem I had was that 2 of the 4 screws included for assembly were stripped. I called amazon to request replacement screws and was told that I would need to return the entire item and a new one would be sent. I'd already put it together (the parts that I could) and I didn't have time for the aggravation. I went to the hardware store, but could not find screws that were the exact size/style. I bought screws that were kinda close, but did not screw in flush, so now 2 of the hooks are a little wobbly."
2,"Looks nice, poor construction",This is a nice looking coat rack. It did not assemble out of the box without me having to use a drill to enlarge the pole assembly hole. It does not tip because of the width of the base which is a big improvement over what I am replacing.
3,Late delivery and not good quality,"We odered this item a week before x- mass , and first time delivery anounsed that this item will be here on Dec , 23-24 , newer happened , on dec 27 I canceled order and was surprised to see that it came two day after cancelation ! Well , we try to ansabled and construction wasn't stable , we put some cardboard paper to make that more sable and it sill have a curve :( if you don't mind to wait longer and can deal with this kind things is right product"
5,Perfect,"This is a very sturdy and well constructed, it brings a little elegance to the room. I am very happy and pleased with my purchase"
5,Coat/Umbrella Stand,This is a quality item. Very heavy..nice finish..looks great in the office environment. Item was received quickly and easily assembled. I highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a coat rack and/or umbrella stand.
5,"easy to assemble, looks nice",Received this as a gift today and was able to assemble it while opening gifts. Took 5 minutes to assemble and it looks great. Meets my expectations!
5,Great price and value!,"Got this quick, better than my expectation with the low price. This was easy to construct, is quite sturdy, and is a perfect use for our small office. I have paid twice as much for a cheap plastic coat rack. This is sturdy metal, stable, good balance, and worth the price. What more can you get for the price?"
4,Stable! Hall Tree,"Stable Hall tree fully realized with this purchase. Hey! It arrived today and was assembled in 15 minutes flat. I've used hall trees in the distant past and what I can remember of them is not a recommendation for their continued use in and of its self. Combining a useful umbrella stand with the hat rack seems a very complimentary way to achieve greater stabily. Mine's safety wired to my Southern California wall. With 3 cats(meow) its only reasonble here (Fritz,NO-O!)."
4,pretty piece of furniture,I really like this coat hanger. It has a little vintage look to it. It's great but the little sticky things that are on the bottom of the legs are coming off and it's a little dis-balanced. I guess I just need to fix that somehow.
4,Earl Mindell's Supplement Bible,"This book is helpful. Since I have it, I don't use it as much, because I find a lot of information on line."
1,These Are Mostly Fake Reviews,"If you doubt this page is filled with fake reviews then try to contact the so-called Mindell Vitamin Company. You won't be able to. No contact numbers, no code of ethics, no standards, just cheap non-standardized supplements, nothing but a rip-off. The AMA should shut him down. He is nothing but a con-artist selling snake-oil. There are a number of great books on vitamins, this book is not one of them. Try Philip Lee Miller, M.D. for an excellent treatment of vitamins, supplements and life-extension. Miller has nothing to sell, just solid information."
5,Joe Montana Boook,I got this book last week and I love it. If you are a true Montana fan it is a must read!!!!
3,boring,"I thought this was boring. It was recommended to me. Very fast read and because it was audio it was too slow for me. So, buy the word version so you can get thru it faster."
3,Wow!,"I'm way to smart to take advice from Joe Montana and some guy I've never heard of who are just out to make a quick buck! I'm not going to buy it.It's the only book available to listen that I am remotely interested in from the Chicago Public Library this week? OK...bring it on.Wait? I forgot, I like Joe! Oh, right, he was one of the greatest of all time! This other bloke, he seems to know a thing or two.I'm being motivated! By Joe Montana and the other guy! The seem to have some good advice. I'll listen again. Wow, the 16 principles all work, all inspire and the practice work is helpful! Yes, Joe and other guy, why don't business people practice? Why not?A good book by what some say is the greatest of all time. Glad I found it."
2,Could be interesting for a fan but poor value for the money,"I got this album a few years ago because I wanted to hear what Enya had to say about herself and her music. I was very disappointed because for your money you get an interview that wasn't very recent even then and was recorded under atrocious conditions. I would have gotten a lot more from it if the interview hadn't been conducted inside a very noisy cafeteria, the constant rattling of dishes was very annoying, they could have at least gone out in a hallway somewhere. I do seem to remember that Enya pronounced her name, I liked that because Irish Gaelic is so unusal to me."
3,Not what I expected,This is not what I was expecting. There are some good stuff on this cd but not the usual Enya beauty.
5,Cucina Pro,"You drink regular coffee and he or she drinks De-caf? No problem! Perfect for company, too. It sure beats two coffee makers and it's programable. It's about time a company came out with this product!!"
3,Cucina Double Pot Coffee Station,"I have been using this, mostly the right pot for several years now. The apparatus that allows you to remove the pot while its filling, fell out right after I got it. Water still fills the pot, you just can't take the pot out before it's finished filling. I really didn't need a 2 pot system but I thought it would be good to have. We rarely use the left side. Now I have a Kerig, which I love, so the Cucina is not used so much."
2,"Barely functional, really crappy oars","These oars suck. Plain and simple. The paddles will function, but not very well. The oars came with my Sevylor HF 360 and I immediately replaced them with a couple canoe paddles, which worked exponentially better and also fit on the side of the boat. I would recommend good paddles over these lame oars."
3,OK for Light Rowing,"The blades on the oars do slip a little when rowing, but they should be ok for light rowing. This is because the blades attach to the shaft by compression.I ""modified"" mine slightly by wrapping duct tape around the shaft and then attaching the blades on top of the duct tape. This eliminates the slipping problem."
3,Hard anodized aluminum is better,"Pretty pots that will impress your friends, but hard anodized aluminum heats quicker and just as evenly, and it's a lot less expensive. We have both kinds and did casual, side-by-side tests that HAA won every time."
3,"Has its moments,but no classic","The eigth studio album from NWOBHM pioneers SAXON is a mix of a few great metal tunes,a cool heavy drum sound,slick commercial production and a few to many filler tracks making for a so-so SAXON release.Songs like the title track ""Rock the Nations"",""Battle Cry"" and especially ""Northern Lady"" are superb SAXON tunes,but the album comes to a grinding halt on ""Running Hot"",""You Ain't No Angel"" and ""Party Til You Puke"",total time wasters if you ask me.This was the bands first studio album without bassist/songwriter Steve Dawson and there is clearly a drop off in the songwriting department from the excellent 1985 release ""Innocence Is No Excuse"".Die hard SAXON fans will no doubt enjoy moments from ""Rock The Nations"" but for newcomers check out there better releases first then get this one."
2,SAXON's worst moment...,"This is SAXON worst's moment... Bad management decisions probably convinced the band that, in order to obtain a larger American audience, they should ""polish"" their sound a bit and embark in the hair-metal bandwagon. The result, of course, was a backlash. ROCK THE NATIONS is just forgetabble, and I'm sure the band knows that.Later, they proved once and for all how good they are and have always been, with albuns like DOGS OF WAR, METALHEAD and the new release, KILLING GROUND.People say SAXON is the IRON MAIDEN who did not work it out, but it's not true. SAXON is much more original and not stuck to formulas as Maiden is."
1,Just forget it,Just forget this album. It's the SAXON equivalent to Judas Priest's TURBO. A total sell out. Blergh!
2,speedo problems,"purchased this product hoping it would be of good quality, but was disappointed,odometer hit 10 miles then flipped over to 110 miles, reset a few times, and same thing happened, also needle jumps all over the place, mounted on a motorbike speed would range from 25 mph to 32 mph when bike was running steady. would not recommend for MB might work ok on a kids bike, but gear at wheel is of poor quality plastic, could not possibly last to long.F.Y.I. joe"
4,"BASIC, but ACCURATE!","This is an good speedometer; very accurate and low cost!. The digital, very expensive speedometer/odom. we own has never worked right! This unit comes with no instructions! But read the other buyer reviews; a nice guy included them for you."
3,Nice product. It cant handle high speeds for too long.,"Company(Pyramid) is efficient company. Received my products in a reasonable amount of time. Speedometer is great if you don't mount it on a motorized bike. Too much torque broke the axle spinny thing. But if you don't have a motor why not buy digital, right? Overall product does what it says even though the RPM's are not accurate because 300rpm's on a 26 inch wheeled bike is approx 23.21 mph and on a 27 inch wheeled bike it is approx 24.08 mph so I am not even sure how accurate it truely is the speedo says 300RPM = 38ish MPH. FORMULA: ie. Wheel diameter 26"" multiply by Pi= 81.7 multiply that by RPM then divide by distance 63360(feet in a mile) then multiply by 60(minutes in an hour)"
3,Speedometer,"The retro speedometer did not work on my mountain bike. Being retro I thought it would mount on my front wheel, but it would not. I have a Mongoose that I purchased in the early 90's. It was the first large (tall) frame mountain bike I could find.So, the retro speedo did not work. It seems to be an adequate item as it is, providing it would work on someones bike."
3,"Not what I needed, but I'm making it work","This wasn't quite the unit I needed. But I'm using the cable with my old speedometer and it seems to be a workable solution. The seller had a big problem figuring out how to ship. Couldn't find the first address at all, then we gave them an alternative address and they botched that. The only good thing is when we didn't get it they corrected their mistake."
3,Loved it while it worked,I got a bicycle in mid June and purchased this Speedometer Pyramid Pro 26/27 with Resettable Odometer about a month later. I was riding almost every day between 15 and 22 miles and liked seeing the length of my rides and checking the time it took for these rides. This guage is easy to read and while it worked it was a joy to see the miles ticking along. It no longer is resettable as the third digit to the left does not move in coordination with the other slots. It is no longer an accurate odometer as the other slots don't work either most of the time. Not a reliable odometer although the speed still works. I would have loved this product if it had not malfunctioned after only 3 months.
4,Speedometer - Odometer,"I purchased this item to keep track of the miles I ride my bike each time I go to the park. It is very nice to know if I have ridden 10, 15, 20 miles. And the speed I am riding is also nice to know. This item is reasonably easy to install. It is very easy to read. I am glad I have this item on my bike. However, on some English racing style bikes which have the fast, easy off front tire, this item may not work. This item appears to be made for bikes where the front wheel is permantly bolted fork. If the front wheel has the fast remove handle, there may be a problem installing the cable."
1,"Poor Seller - no instructions, no support","The product came in a timely fashion and seems neat, however it came with no instructions. I emailed the company through Amazon and did not receive a reply. My son is very disappointed that his new accessory doesn't work and I am very disappointed that the company will not support their product."
5,Pyramid Retro-mechanical Bicycle Speedometer,Very satisfied to find this speedometer available. Perfect to put with my Schwinn Cruiser Deluxe 7.....had been searching for something like this for awhile. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear.
5,good oly tyme speedometer,"I HAD A SPEEDOMETER LIKE THIS ONE EXCEPT IT WAS SQUARE-SHAPED WHEN I WAS A KID AND I LOVED IT, SO WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE I PURCHASED IT FOR MY SON. HE LOVES IT, HE LIKES THE FACT THAT HE CAN SEE HOW FAST AND HOW FAR HE HAS GOME ON HIS BIKE."
2,its ok,when i brought this i thought it was really big and silly looking i mean it was cool the see the original needle move up when i sped up but it arrived damaged. the numbers that are suppose to move didnt ihad to take it apart to fix the inside piece that came loose. then after i got it to work it just didnt work properly. i ended up taking it off my bike and trashing this i really didnt like it and it looked stupid on my bike.
2,Peddle 15MPH for 1HR = 0 miles!,"This odometer worked great for a week or so, but it now no longer keeps track of the miles, only the speed. It's not the same as the one in the picture, but i don't expect to get the speed up that high anyway.I didn't think about it before but the gauge design does slow you down ever so very slightly."
5,Nice addition to bike,"recently purchased speedo and am very happy with this product, though i was not keen on the plastic speedometer. Installation of the speedo drive was fairly easy. It puts minimal drag on wheel and looks really good on the bike - gives it a nice retro touch."
5,Great product,"Have searched all over for one of these, very hard to come by. Easily fitted, good quality item, speedy service. Is accurate checked with sat nav. What can I say if you need a speedo get one of these-Brilliant!"
3,speedo,"This is a nice product although for most people, directions for installing would be welcome. I had no problem in this area since I do this type of thing(installing)."
1,Didn't Work >10mph,"This hooked up fairly simply even though there were no instructions. ONce my son was on it though he told me that it obediently went up to 10mph and then pegged on the maximum setting - I have no idea why it has this problem (I tried it, just to say if he had his facts straight - he did!) - this wasn't that much money and I have yet to send it back for a refund - that's my next move."
4,like old times,"the first one was bad, recived a new one in days,no problem.good job, i refer these store i'll be backfor sure thank you.....stanley"
1,Plastic speed-o,"Worked for 3 days, speed-o goes to 50 MPH. I had mine to 30 MPH and put 30 MI. on it before it went crazy and quit working! (must have a 30/30/3 warranty) 3 days 30 MPH or 30 MI. which ever comes first. Might be O.K. on a bike with out a motor. All plastic construction is its down fall ""I think""!Retro 26"" and 27"" wheel Speedometer NEW"
1,Speedometer Pyramid,"I purchased this speedometer on 8/18/2008 and when it got 57 miles on it, It quit working. The needle went all the way around and has not worked since. I would not purchase or recommend this product again."
1,Worst piece of plastic,"This speedometer is a cheap knock-off. It is all plastic. One trip down a bumpy road and the odometer failed after 2.5 miles. Once I opened it up everything from the dial face plate right down to the gears inside is all PLASTIC! Hardly worth the aggravation to go through to install it. It doesn't even come any instructions. It has ""JUNK"" written all over it. What a waste of money. The only thing made of metal are two face plate screws, two rear case screws and the drive cable. Oh and did I forget the mount. The gauge metal was hardly stronger than cardboard."
1,Junk,just got this speed o and is way off. I swamped it 100 times and still tops out and says I went 100 miles it two feet. junk don't get it.
1,GARBAGE,"It's 90% Plastic, that should say it all... It lasted 75 miles and then took a dump.. Save your money find something else..."
3,Bicycle Speedometer Analog,Bought this as a gift for a friend who likes things simple.It's a nice product a lot of plastic in the crucial parts (gears & nuts).The cable is to short to mount on the handle bars unless it's going on a smallbicycle had to mount on the handlebar stem. Also there are no instructions of any kind. Not sure how it will hold up to being used on a daily basis.
4,big,"this thing is alot bigger than I expected. It looks great, I haven*t yet tried it, but I hope it works. I wish the cable was just a few more inches longer. for the price its right."
2,Instructionless speedometer,Nice speedometer and works great! but came with NO installations instructions at all. Good thing that I am mechanically inclined.Even with that it took 1 hour of trial and error to get it install correctly. The greatest problem with with the bike's frontwheel itself. The speedometer sensor changed clearances with all of the bolt arrangement on the front wheel. Instructions aboutthis short-coming would have been very welcome. But still it is a nice speedometer for the money. I only rated it lower due tothe absence of instructions.
1,Plastic Rubbish!!,"I just got this in today and like everybody else no instructions,I installed it and the meter was all the way to the right so I tried messing with it and got it to the 0 postion but then it didn't work when I took a ride and then the miles were so off it was a joke.I regret not seeing the bad reviews for this,I learned my lesson,wish someone out there would make something like this that would actually work and NOT a plastic piece of junk."
1,Where's the damn directions ?,"Just as another reviewer wrote above, mine had no instructions included. Worse, I just bought a one speed beach cruiser coaster brake type bike and I don't think these are made for it. There was just not enough space. If I tried to the left of the fork nearest the spokes, it would require eliminating the inner nut that keeps the cone secure. when I tried the space to the outside of the fork leg, the trip lever won't reach inside the spokes. The problem is simple ... the center hole in the unit is just too small to fit over the cone and the cone locking nut so as to lay tight to the spoke side of the axle ... In sheer desparation I used a Dremel tool to cut out the axle sized hole all the way up to a hole big enough to slide over the cone and the cone stop nut. Seems to work fine now."
1,"not for 26"" wheels and has weak counter spring","this speedometer is not calibrated for the 26"" wheel. and the counter spring gives out if you go over 20 mph for more than a week."
1,Toy Speedometer,"Got this speedo for my Diamondback Wildwood Citi and after checking if against a GPS and car it reads 20mph and my real speed was 13.5mph thats 6.5mph faster then I was going. Furthermore after riding 12 miles (miles confirmed with car and moped) the odometer showed 1 mile more then the real distance. Also there is no way to correct this other then removing the speedometer and getting another type. I am sure that it's ONLY made for a 27"" bike not a 26""(80""per wheel rev.)and for the price I didnt expect perfection but 6.5mph off is really bad.I think this would be a good speedometer for a child as it's more Toy then real speedometer.thats my $0.02 worth"
1,Speedometer,"Ordered two of these and both didn't work worth a crap. One of them the needle just went from 0 speed all the way around until it hit 0 speed again. The second one, the needle just moved back and forth. Not knowing what your real speed was."
4,sunlite speedometer,"i received the speedometer in 2 days.i put it together in no time seems to work good,looks good and you can read it good,pity it douse not have a light in it for the dark,good for the cost.."
1,Worked for a couple weeks then nothing.,"Bought this for my fiance's bike, we go out together often, he likes to track how far we have gone. After only 50 miles the speedometer/odometer no longer works."
3,Awesome,No instructions came with it. It was easy to assemble though. The only upsetting thing was that the cable is shorter than I had expected. I had to re-adjust the handlebars to get the cable to reach long enough. The look of the speedometer counteracts the cons though. I haven't hit the maximum on it yet :-D
1,Not impressed,"The speedo looks good, but the wheel attaching mechanism is made so cheaply that it only worked for a few miles before it bent the arm and stopped working. I was able to fix it for a while longer, but it is a lost cause. I knew before I purchased this item that it was not super durable product, but did not think it would be this bad.Do not buy!"
2,didn't work with my bike,opened the box put it all together figured out how to mount it on my handle bars but could not figure out how to put it on my front rim i had and idea how it was supposed to work but couldn't get it to go where i wanted. I waited for my dad to get home being I'm only fourteen and my dad is good at figuring things like that out he couldn't get anything to work either.so we figured out it would not work on my bike so although it looks cool with vintage bikes save yourself the disappointment and get A digital electric one.even though it really does look like the best you can find to go with a vintage bike
1,disappointed in vegas,"I received the speedometer, it comes with no documentation what so ever.Thankfully my brother was able to get it going, and the odemeter worked forthe first 12 miles and stopped. So unfortunately we also question the accuracyof the speedomter."
1,Lasted .2 miles,"The only thing good about this item is that I know exactly how long it worked: .2 miles. Too bad because I had one like this when I was a kid, and I thought it would be fun. It wasn't."
4,Nice old school mechanical speedometer,"I found one of these about 5 years ago for a new mountain bike that I had received for Christmas. I generally dislike the electronic bike speedometers, after trying to install them on my kids bikes and ending up with wires getting broken and electronic pickups not working. For this bike, I wanted a mechanical unit, which are getting hard to find. I have a mechanical speedomter that has been on my Sears ten speed since it was new in 1977 (the speedometer actually dates back to 1972) and that one still works after almost 40 years and 2000 miles.As for this unit, I don't recall having a lot of trouble installing it. I have logged over 100 miles on it and it works smoothly so far. I believe that it might not be as accurate as my older speedometer (seems to read a bit high), but it's cool and does what I want it to do. I also agree with other reviewers- it is kind of on the big side."
3,"Is ok, just didn't come with instructions.","Product was good. However, I bought it for my grandfather who is very old and not technology savvy. Even for myself it was hard to figure out how the product went onto his bike. So I would suggest sending it with instructions. Other than that he loves the product."
5,Great movie!,"This is a fantastic, inspiring movie, and it's a must see for everyone. The world needs more movies like this : )"
5,"Read the cow, be the cow- purple that is","I got an early copy of this book and have read it several times and get new ideas every time. In marketing we spend way to much time following and being safe- this book gives you the kick you need to be remarkable. And if your business isn't remarkable it gives you the wake up call needed to get out there and become remarkable and to keep finding new ways to be a ""purple cow"". Buy the book, read the book, be remarkable, and make sure everyone in the organization and those with whom you do business with read the book. This is a marketing book you can put to work today."
3,A copied cow,"As a master in popular writing.( A remarkable auto seller) in this book ,the author shows again his capability to make references to remarkableideas from others (His merit, putting those examples in an original way. I think for this book title the author should have made a clear introductory reference an implicit permit) to the the origin and to the practice of the purple cow: The european MILKA story. The story of a famous swiss chocolate brand. Nothing against benefiting from remarkable ideas but a bit less self medailling would have made this publication more valuable. Theo Kerstjens profesional brander)"
3,"good idea, somewhat dated","This is a book that will push you to create something extraordinary. Godin's basic point is that we don't remember ordinary experiences, like the airline that got you to your destination on-time or the meal that was merely OK. Instead, we become passionate over excellent, ""above and beyond"" service and products. We rave about them to our friends and neighbors, which is the best marketing there is. And about the only marketing that works.Which is Godin's point - in order to break through the clutter, we must create the truly extraordinary. Do work that scares you, that's on the edge. Don't be like other people - be unique.A compelling idea, not sure if it deserves an entire book. After a while, it's the same story of iconoclasm again and again. Also, some of the examples are dated now, like JetBlue as a paragon of customer service and Godin's comment about mobile phones being commodities at this point - obviously written before the iPhone."
1,PURPLE COWDUNG..,"You know, before this book we were all sitting about in our drab marketing cubicles scampering to look EXACTLY like each other, with no glimmer of novelty in our existence. But then along came Mr. Godin with a sententious little epiphany -- Hey, why not be different, cuz people will notice, you know!You bet. And if this primeval rainbow had to be squeeze-dried and smudged into a book, perhaps the least we could have been blessed with would be ONE piece of wisdom on HOW to be different.That's missing. As is anything else of any meaning here, barring about a dozen not-so-amoosing cow puns on the carton, or perfectly predictable notions about ""setting up a dialog with your customers"".""Ideavirus"" was somewhat passable in its content but this monograph belongs snugly in the milk carton whence it emerged. Actually, come to think of it, the carton is the only thing I may want to keep."
3,Case Studies,While Puple Cow offered some great examples and inspiration it was merely a compilation of case studies and had little hands-on directives for the readers. The brevity was nice as I was able to read it in 2 days.
3,"Very good, but not remarkable","This is a very good book, but it's not remarkable. However it is about trying to be remarkable, and while what Godin says is very useful, it's also nothing new. I've seen this book get a lot of hype, and I can see why it has gotten such hype, especially with the current economy, and businesses wanting to stand out and be more relevant, and certainly Godin exemplifies what he talks about, as is evidenced by Squidoo and his books. At the same time, what would have made Purple Cow remarkable would be more than just telling stories of what other people have done. Providing some exercises, or some in-depth case studies, as opposed to brief anecdotes provided, may have made it remarkable. Unfortunately, and ironically, with this book Godin has fallen into the very trap he discusses in it: His ideas have become so commonplace, they are no longer remarkable."
2,Too simplistic,An interesting approach on driving the differentiation concept. The book is built around 1 single idea which gets repetitive at the end. Uses the color of the cow as a marketing gimmick - another commercial book by Seth Godin.
3,Makes Some Good Points,"This is a small book and a quick read and if you're stuck on the marketing aspect of your business, definitely pick it up. Marketing and business guru Seth Godin makes a few very valid points in this book and backs everything up with real life examples. The drawback is that the book was published in 2002 and a few of the ideas and conclusions are outdate (i.e. his hypothesis that cell phone technology was dead with no further advancements probable) Still, I'll say it again, he does make some valid points and I found it worth having a look at. It could save you time, money and frustration in the long run.Hope this helps! Best, Hunter Phoenix [...]"
5,INSPIRING!,"PURPLE COW shows you a new way to look at how to make your business thrive and provides a bunch of relevant examples. Seth Godin in a very smart man, indeed."
4,Simplicity rules.,"Purple Cow follows Godin's key strength: simplicity. Using very few words, Purple Cow succeeds in transmitting a powerful concept that can be applied in a vast array of areas.Top notch."
5,"A must-read for managers, leaders, and entreprenuers!","This is an excellent book that should be read by leaders, managers, and entrepreneurs in every industry. Even if you are just sitting at home on your couch, feeling sluggish, and completely uncreative, pick up this book. It will not only spire you, but also give you the tools you need to be remarkable."
1,"Overrated, Generic & Forgettable","I agree with the majority of the points made in the book but I didn't gain anything by reading it. I can quote books that I have read in high school school but I can't quote anything from this book. It was very generic information that isn't unique to the book. That is ironic because the PURPLE COW is centered around being uniques. This book is everything but unique or special. It drags on even though it is very short. I can summarize the entire book for you:TV and mass media were new frontiers 50 years ago so fortunes could be made by putting a lot of money into advertising mediocre products. Today people have seen it all so they don't notice ads anymore. To be successful you need a PURPLE COW, meaning something shocking that causes people to tell their friends. Word of mouth is the BEST marketing because it is effective, economical and hard for competitors to duplicate. Most important it comes from a trusted source, your friend. THE END!"
4,It's time for a green cow,"If you're feeling stuck in your marketing program, read this book. While it's short on ""how-to's"", it tops the charts in inspiration. The author provides ample evidence that you won't get noticed unless you stand out, and with so many products and services on the market today, you won't get business if you don't stand out. Purple cows stand out. The problem is that once everyone gets their hands on a purple cow, we get bored with purple cows.Use this book as a reminder to keep innovating. Once you think you've got it down to a science, start your next process of reinvention. The book is an easy read - one or two sittings should do it. But, once you're done, keep it around. I keep it on my shelf as a reminder, not a reference book. If you need to shake things up in your marketing efforts, this book is a great place to begin.sid@bizwordsmiths.com"
5,The Perfect Purple Cow,"This book was recommended to me by several marketing collegues as a must read. I became a fan of Seth's work after reading this book. He addresses being different, thinking different and marketing different are keys to standing out and being noticed. I already was a believer in this philosophy, but Seth's numerous examples, enjoyable writing style and wit made this book a wonderful read. I think this is a must have book for any marketing person or entrepreneur. Once you read it, you will get hooked as a fan of Seth's style, and message. This book encourages you to examine what you are doing or not doing to be a leader in your industry. It challenges you to think outside the box, and create extraordinary campaigns, messages and results. We don't live in a world that allows ordinary to last very long. If you want to prosper, you will need to become the purple cow!"
1,Seth Godin used to write better books,"I agree with James Sadler, there is nothing new in this book. Seth Godin didn't say anything that a student or a person who works with marketing already know. He only gave a new name: Purple Cow. For me, this book has very superficial comments and examples. I'm very disappointed!!!"
2,More Buzz than Substance,"Quite disappointed. I expect something exciting other than another book telling people to be different. I prefer a solid book such as 'High Intensity Marketing' or 'Kellogg on Marketing' - both are ideas packed and very practical. I like his style of writing but at the end of the day..it is ""quality of the milk"" that matters....not the color of the cow."
3,Seth Godin Purple Cow,"(Please note, I give this book a solid 4 stars, not 3..My mistake )Good book on branding and positioning. Some may say over-rated? I say, great read while you got an hour or two to kill. Good weekend read. Great entry level marketing book. His stories of companies standout the most to me. (I.E. - Tombstone, Volkswagon, Wonder Bread). These are great examples of making your business remarkable. I really enjoyed the insight into ""The Death of the TV Industrial Complex"""
1,disappointing,"dull and boring read, packed with well know case studies (p&g, coke) you may find in any avarage business magazine"
2,Purple Cow,It took forever for this author to get to the meat of what this book was about. I would not recommend this book to anyone else.
3,Some good ideas,"Purple Cow is a book about transforming your business by being remarkable. Well, I don't own a business--I don't even have a job. I'm a stay at home mom, but I still found the ideas in this book useful. The idea that you need to be remarkable or be invisible can apply to every day life. It works outside of the business world. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially since it's a really quick read."
2,Purple Cows Could Give Better Marketing Advice,"I was really hoping this book would be...well, a purple cow! I thought I would get some new and creative advice on marketing my organization, but this certainly didn't help. All of the examples are based on common sense and despite the fancy title this book was dull and boring. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Purple Cow - a light mid-afternoon snack of a book,"Having heard others describe this as a ""visionary work"" I read Purple Cow with great expectations. The central message of the book is ""be different"", in other words, don't follow industry norms or you'll never stand out and be noticed. Seth Godin certainly has some interesting ideas, and I have to say I agree with pretty much all of them, it's just that if one reads this book expecting to find deep intellectual stimulation or new marketing ideas one will be disappointed. It is essentially a lightweight thought-bite work, more a mid-afternoon snack than a feast of new ideas. If you read this book before reading Blue Ocean Strategy you'll find it stimulating. If you read Blue Ocean Strategy (W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne) first you'll find Purple Cow has altogether too little weight, research and well presented data to back up the central argument of the book. A good book to read on a short train ride to kill the time."
2,purple patties,"i bought this book looking for something different to generate some creativity in my business life. well, it starts out interesting and i'm thinking ""hmm.. that makes sense."" but as i keep going it changed into ""duh! everyone knows that!"" this book is just a new metaphor for the same idea - to stand out in business endeavors make yourself unique. i've read many books that preach the same thing. and i suppose that theory works because you think they are all different but they are not.. i think i'm going to writing a book about the same thing but come up with a catchy gimmick to sell more books before everyone catches on."
5,"If I Could Give It 5-Stars Plus 10 Big 'Ole Moos, I Would!","Truly one of the most profound Aha Moments of my writing-for-publication journey!Nothin' beats being a Purple Cow (or horse) on the Yellow Brick Road to Publishing Oz!!!Thanks Bunches, Seth Godin, for leading the way!!!I will forever believe and act as if ""safe is risky"" and never doubt that ""boring has already been done""."
4,This works for me,I bought the book because of the remarkabe front!This is a remarkable marketing book by Seth Godin. It is about the fact that advertising for new products does not work anymore nowadays. Consumers are able to tun advertising almost completely off. And the killer products are remarkable products instead of products heavily advertised. Its shows numerous examples about what existing companies did. But don't be disappointed when you do not find the recipe for your company.
4,Purple Cow,"the Purple Cow is an excellent book for anyone in any type of business. It talks about the importance of creating your Purple Cow to get noticed. It talks about Purple Cows that other business owners have successfully created.It also talks about what happens to companies that don't create a Purple Cow. An excellent book about "" thinking outside the box"" marketing."
1,"I think I'm really, really dumb","There is nothing remarkable about Godin's book on being remarkable. All the info in this book is basic business sense. I am an artist.. how can I possibly sign my name to a painting that I do not feel is original or remarkable?? Anyone who starts a business knows the info in this book. If you didn't think your product was better than others why on earth would you have launched it? Unless you are like really, really dumb."
4,How are you a purple cow?,"A twist on marketing. This is about niche marketing at the extreme. It's practical and makes you really think about your product or service and how it's a purple cow. It's similar to the current IBM TV commercial out right now about ""what makes you special?"" A great tool for product concept."
1,save your hard-earned cash,"Seth Godin's basic idea is fundamentally flawed. His ""formula"" for success is to differentiate your business, be remarkable and use original ideas. However, any business that follows his advice is by definition a follower, not a leader. It has been proven over and over again that followers succeed, not leaders. Leaders take the lumps while followers reap the benefits. It's much more expensive for a company to learn something the hard way than to learn from others mistakes. Look at successful knockoff businesses like mightyhot.com and bensbargains.net. They have virtually no operating costs and copied the business model perfected by larger competitors.Godin claims that you are better off by differentiating, but that's just a ploy to get you to buy his book. If you buy the book you've already fallen into his trap. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,MOO!!!!,"This book was so convincing that I bought an additional 25 of his book to go visit him at his office. Some people just understand business.There are limits to everything in the world around you. If you are creative and courageous enough to explore them you will find success, or it will soon find you.As important as any message is, the delivery usually dictates what will be successful and what will fail. If you gain nothing from the easy to read book, you should at least recognize that its means of distribution made it a success."
5,Must read!,If you are in business you need to understand this book. Don't waste time with anything else. Read it now. Or don't at your peril.
1,A Whole Lot of Hype...No Substance,"This book is a whole lot of packaging devoid of any real insight.I think he wrote this book to write off his family vacation to France as a business expense. (See, the Purple Cow idea came to him while he was in France.)To sum up the whole book, you can transform your business by being remarkable. That's it. He doesn't go into how because then you wouldn't need to pay for his consulting services.A 100 page brochure. I'm glad someone gave me a copy because paying money for this is a crime."
1,Nothing Substancial There At All,"I bought the book with high hopes but after reading it felt that it lacked anything substantial. The concepts presented are very simple and there's nothing new presented in it. There are about 1000 books that are better on branding, marketing, and transforming a business. I would definitely save the money on this one."
4,Purple Cow,"Great read as per the focus of marketing $$$.Seth's book has helped me in shifting my pardigmwith marketing for my businesses.Thanks so much,Seth B."
2,Excellent title and front cover. That's all.,"I think most readers, like me, already know the importance to make a product remarkable, innovative and outstanding (a purple cow in a group of brown) so as to differentiate it from the sea of competitors. What we want is the means to do it. It's disappointing that the author focused on the ""why""s with many not so ""accurate"" or ""relevant"" examples and counter-examples, but failed to deliver the ""how""s as promised on the book title: to transform and to be remarkable. He kept on criticizing the common 4Ps and the TV ad push type marketing, but couldnt bring out something new, systematic and practical for managers to follow, especially those who work in big corps where red tape had choked most of the innovation process. I am sorry to say this book simply lacks substance but is full of cliche. Unless marketing, customer-orientation and differentiation is something new to you, I am quite sure you will get the same opinion as mine if you can finish reading it."
1,"P.T. Barnum lives, writes ""business"" books!","Let's just start with the startling tautology that is this book:To be remarkable, be remarkable!This reminds me immediately of Steve Martin's advice on how to make ten million dollars:""First, start with nine million dollars.""I was tempted by the headline, ""Udderly ridiculous,"" but that sounds too mirthful. This book and its apparent viral marketing strategy distrubs, even angers me.Predicted next books:""Getting Rich By Getting Rich""""To Lose Weight, Lose Weight!""""Burning Calories The Exercise Way!""It's one thing to write an unremarkable book. It's another to try to pull the purple cowhide over our eyes. I'm not fooled. At least a dozen other readers apparently weren't either."
3,Making your product stick out,"A munchie-size book saying: try to make your product stick out, so people notice it and start talking about it. If that was already obvious to you, then you don't need to read it."
2,Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable,I have a lot of stuff by Seth Godin and think he is brilliant but this book disappointed me.After reading Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore which Seth eludes to in a lot of his work I think Purple Cow brings Moores book in to the 21st century and adds different words but the meaning and theory of Crossing the Chasm still remain Moores work.It is one of Seth Godins early works and having familiarised my self with most of Seth's later stuff I think that's what caused disappointment.Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable is inspirational for those wanting to get some idea of how ideas where virtually created out of nothing and his definition of a Purple Cow is essential if you want to do anything in life worth talking about.I did read the reviews before I bought and expected a bit more and something new but that never happened.Mike WhitenburghPsychoanalyst.
2,Common Sense Book,I have read about half of the book and i dont even want to read the other half its just not interesting at all. The writer talks about basic information nothing special.
4,stroke me like a compressed version of Eating the Big Fish,"Sure we (the marketing crowd) all know this already. We know world is getting so fast you have to find a way to be remarkable. We know if we dont find that way we will get lost in the masses and become invisible. But sometimes we forget it in our daily business. I dont necessarily agree with the whole ideavirus idea. But I do believe in being remarkable. I also believe being remarkable is all about creating a relevant remerkable temporary monopoly, and competing on the level where noone else has gone (yet. hence temporary). Is it easy to do? No. Its ok to be reminded of it in a book compact enough to act as a wake up call. Easy read for non-marketing people as well."
4,Well Done,"A conglomeration of ideas and writings from many different authors. I recommend the audiobook format. Seth Godin's speaking voice makes this audio especially interesting. I prefer the books written only by Seth Godin, however, as he truly puts his heart into what he writes."
5,A good kick in the pants,"Seth Godin is a kinder, gentler Tom Peters. Jay Leno to David Letterman. He packs all the ""I should have thought of things that way"" wallop of a Peters book into a clean, elegant, quick read.At the end of the day, this isn't a Porter book. This isn't about strategy with a capital ""S"". Rather, it is a passionate and convincing essay on the business merits of producing remarkable user experiences."
2,Repetitive and slow,"I think that the point was made early on in the book, and there were just may more pages of the same message following. It was hard to make it through. I got bored with it."
5,remarkable,This book is a must read for ANY entrepreneur. Any business person.. anyone who wants to make a difference in his professional life.Get it NOW!
4,Good marketing,"The ideas in this book is not new. In fact, Godin just rehashed a basic marketing idea into a very pretty book. The contents on its own would be 2 or maybe 3 stars.But why I gave this book 4 stars is the way he marketed it. He basically made his book a Purple Cow. That is what I got out of this book.I call that Good Marketing."
3,Hong on the Range,"Hong on the Range is good fun, filled with puns (like the title) and jokes. It's a parody of every pulp western ever written with the hero the lone outsider with a secret(his secret is he's fully human in a world of cyborgs). It's full of outlaws and clever gadgets, not to mention several women none of whom are what they seem to be. Because it's anon-stop tongue in cheek parody, the humor gets tiresome at times. One wishes it would go somewhere, but still, It's endlessly inventive and perfect for what it is."
3,A surprise!,"Kind of a rip-off. The CD is only 3 songs..............and 2 are the same!!!The title song however, is awesome!"
2,Personally i don't reckon you buying this...,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Mariah fan but this just ain't the thing i would give 5 stars to. I feel the interviewer spoke more than Mariah herself, and there's not really much content in the interview. Boring. Buy it only if you just want to collect every Mariah item out there, or else save the money for something more worthwhile."
3,Reprint Quality,"With any reprint you expect a certain amount of degrade in the quality, but this was still considerably more grainy than should be acceptable for the price.Had I seen it beforehand I would not have spent more than $12 on it. It's a large size, which is nice, but I wonder that I might have gotten a better looking print by finding the photo and having it enlarged myself.Still, I've seen worse prints and from far away it's still rather handsome. Not a complete waste of money, but still disappointing."
5,safe and simple,These Pilates exercises are safe and simple. They include recommendations for a sleep posture which I enjoy doing. I have a back challenge and this posture works. I sometimes get up pain free when I do this. The postures are yoga like and restorative. The only things I would modify is that I prefer abdominal breathing and prefer a vegan diet. But I can easily modify the exercises to match my preferences and still get a lot out of this book.
1,"Book not in color, too many words and too few diagrams","Only a charlatan would write a book in black and white, with 15 diagrams and 50,000 words about solving the Rubik's cube.One has to buy another book to decipher the verbage in this book. Maybe this was state-of-art in the 80s but I was wrong in buying this!"
1,Mastering Rubik's Cube,The title of this book is not the proper title for the book. It should be titled for those that already know the Cube by heart. That title used is misleading stating to master the Cube for Beginners or anyone. Wrong title altogether.I'll keep looking for a beginners book showing step by step. If you have it or know where it is please advise me.Gerald Baltezore
3,"Interesting Album, but nothing like Spirit.","Randy California was in a class by himself as a tallented Guitarist. In the case of this album he tends to be a bit too self-indulgent. He uses many effects and electronic wizardry, which tend to cloud his skills here. The version of The Beatles Rain strays way to far from the original arrangment(almost too much to even consider it a cover). I did like Mother and Child Reunion alot. The bonus tracks are fun. ""Live for the Day"" sucsessfully channels Randy's old friend Jimi Hendrix. It would have been great, to say the least, if at some point the two could could have done an album together. Rebel is a spooky instrumental with a very cool vibe about it."
5,this blows away any new hard rock cd you have!,former leader of spirit along with mitch mitchell and noel rdding some of the heaviest ever recorded covers of the beatles Rain and severely Hendrix style guitar A MUST
2,A real disappointment,"I had to struggle to keep my interest in this book until the end. But I finished it, with the hope that there would HAVE to be some amazing payoff in the end. I love Karin Slaughter, but I have to say, she really dropped the ball on this one. I was actually 87% of the way through the book (according to my Kindle) before it even got interesting. In the end, I was wrong. There was no real payoff."
3,Disappointed,"The book for the most part is well-written. I did care about Sara & Lena up to a point but the story unnecessarily dragged on. But what disappointed me was the unrealisticness of the ending. I saw another reviewer said it is a novel, if you want reality read the news. However, while dramatic freedom is OK for literature, absurdity & stunts insult readers' intelligence. Tessa's survival was absurd. The solution was so far-fetched as to be absurd. And this gimmick of introducing a new plot twist to finally solve the problem, without giving readers any clue beforehand-surprising it was such a mystery anyway, just didn't work for me. And BTW, the cop Jeffrey was clueless & obnoxious, I guess Sara's relationship with him is a prime candidate for ""Smart Women, Foolish Choices."" And as an aside, somebody should have corrected the spelling of succinylcholine."
3,Pretty Good Read,"This is the third novel in the Grant County series. The plot in this one, revolves around the investigation of a number of apparent suicides, in the local university campus.I felt the storyline was pretty good, if not quite unputdownable. There is quite a bit of a 'whodunnit' about it. I thought the the books main characters of Sara Linton, and Jeffrey Tolliver, along with Lena Adams were quite believeable. The dialogue between them was good, as well. The book is certainly worth a read, if you are interested in the thriller genre."
5,Great addition to the series!,"This is a great addition to the Grant County series, and builds nicely on the events of previous books. The ending makes for a nice twist and promises for exciting things to come."
2,Mistakes Overshadow Even Mayhem and Unsympathetic Characters,"Since others have addressed the continuous decline of Lena and unsympathetic characters, I'll focus on one major unexplicable mistake and another that even a casual viewer of CSI would catch. Why didn't some--copy editor, line editor?--catch the author's colossal mistake of identifying a shotgun as a rifle. This mistaken identity was repeated over and over. Didn't anyone involved in this book know the difference between a rifle and a shotgun?Secondly, just about anyone who watches Law and Order, CSI or other crime shows would know that the depth of a knife wound is measured, the tip of a broken tip lodged in the body would be matched to the type of knife and the four-inch blade of a pocket knife couldn't reach from the surface of a burly chest to a shoulder blade.Mistakes like this lower respect for the author and publisher."
5,Great !!!!!!!,Intriguing. Interesting just like all of Karen Slaughters books. I enjoyed it immensely . Never put it down until I finished it.
2,Not a Slaughter fan,This was my first book by this author and I won't buy another of hers. Don't care for her writing or her characters. Just not my taste.
2,A Faint Cold Fear,"I bought this book as it was recommened and was compared to novels by Patricia Cornwell. I read at least one book a week and I found this book not worth the read. The main character, Sara's sister has been brutally attacked and yet, Sara and her ex-husband spend more time in inane banter about their relationship than on the murders and Tessa's attack. I am sorry but the characters are weak and to compare this novel to Patricia Cornwell is a slap to Cornwell. Only buy this in paperback and used, if ever."
5,Awsome Writer!!!!,Would tell everyone to read Karin's book.She is a great writer and makes you feel your part of the story.A little pricy but worth it to read though and auto book are WAY TO COSTLY!!! If you want to listen to one you have to go to library to try to find it and they don't always have them.Amazon should have a free download library to listen to book one time then they just take off your account when your done.
3,I agree - not so good.,"Besides being tediously slow, this book somehow seemed very scattered with lots of useless information and loose closing of subplots. Gross as usual, with a totally strange ending indeed. We'll see with the next volume, which is much more highly rated, what becomes of that?! I found the whole thing quite strange and a bit difficult to follow. Too much was a bit hard to swallow."
3,well written but gory,"One of the problems I had with this book actually suggests that maybe ms. slaughter is succeeding well with her writing: I really disliked most of the characters. The unfortunate side effect is that at times I didn't want to keep reading. I disliked Lena for her self-destructiveness and hostility, but I actually think that the character is well drawn and developed. I also disliked Jeffrey and can't understand why Sara tolerates him -- he strikes me as being seriously violent and a jumper to conclusions. As to the book as a whole, the solution was not very satisfying, especially as regards Sara's sister Tessa; I would have liked a more interesting, less contrived solution. Also I think the brutality was excessive."
3,"Entertaining, ok...... not great.",This was a fairly good book. The story kept me interested. I enjoyed the forensic portions. I am getting tired of Slaughter reviving her characters and their pasts in every single book. Would be nice to see new characters for a change.
4,WOW,"I've read all three books by KS - this was by far the most graphic and best all around. I think we are starting to really know her main characters and we may not always like what they do, we still like them. The ending in this one was another ""WOW"". READ IT!!"
1,This Is Not A Good Book.,"I lost interest after a few chapters with the most unlikeable characters I have read about in a long time. Sara and Jeffrey's ridiculous relationship was utterly stupid. The first introduction to Tessa made me want to slap her silly. I read on for awhile but after a third of the way through I got so fed up with these obnoxious people that I went to the last chapter and found out that the ending was just as silly as the beginning. This gets an F. If you must read this, get it from the library or have someone loan it to you. If you spend money buying it, you will be sorry."
1,"Despicable, unrealistic characters","After reading Kisscut, I thought that I'd found a new author to add to my list of frequent reads. In Kisscut, I was able to overlook the unlikeability of Slaughter's characters because the rest of the book was pretty interesting. In A Faint Cold Fear, though, the despicable, unrealistic, miserable characters completely overwhelm the purported plot of the book. It's not merely that Slaughter's characters are ""unsympathetic"" or ""unlikeable"" as other reviewers have commented, it's that they behave completely irrationally and in ways that I can only hope no real person would.Although I NEVER give up on a book before finishing it, I put this one down half way through, and I will not purchase Slaughter again."
2,Lack of research,"I read all the reviews and not one mentioned a very glaring error. The terms ""gauge,"" ""skeet,"" ""caliber,"" and ""rifle"" are not synonymous. Yet, Karin Slaughter uses them together, switches back and forth between them to a confusing degree. I don't pretend to be an expert in firearms, but I do know that sportsmen shoot skeet with a shotgun, not a rifle. And the ammunition for a shotgun is measured by gauge, not caliber. A rifle is an entirely different weapon using ammo measured in calibers. And her coroner and a police chief don't know the difference? Come on now. I'm closing the book forever on page 143 and deliver me from careless authors."
2,Extremely overrated author,"Contrived situations, absurd and extremely unlikeable characters -- there wasn't much I cared for about this book. The murders were piling on so fast it became numbing, the gore was so extreme it had the opposite effect of adding realism. If you want a small-town view of a big, bad crime, this might be the book for you, but it's not very good. It got to be a little too ""sticks and hicks"" for me."
2,Should Have Been Much Better,"a troubling story in which the author supplies a cast of characters who ALL seem to have sexual-physical-mental abuse in their backgrounds, which affects their jobs and their personal relationships a little too much; it's very hard to empathize with a cast composed of totally wacko characters and leads one to question the authors background; does she really see the world as she presents it? or is she just trying too hard to shock for better book sales? such as the ""kicker"" ending in which Lena is revealed as having killed her boss after she had already disabled him and defended herself from his attempted physical abuse"
2,Not so good,"I agree with the other reviewer. A lot of nothing and a poor ending. Usually I love your books Ms Slaughter, but with the amount of vulgarity, it just made your work trashy. You have a real talent for writing, as good as James Patterson. I've read your newer books and they weren't as vulgar although you seem to think that the ""f"" word is the only word in the dictionary. You could reach a whole world of new readers if you would just clean up the language."
2,Didn't like it,First book I have read from this author: too much gratuitous violence and the characters were never sympathetic....I kept on reading to find out what happened but would not read another from her.
4,Another good read from Karin Slaughter,I really enjoy the Grant County series. The characters are well developed and become friends you care about thru the series.I have recommended this series to my sisters as they enjoy the same types of novels as I do.
3,Was the editor asleep or...,"Was the editor asleep or merely ignorant? The same goes for Ms. Slaughter. The story was entertaining, but she needs to get some facts down. Reviewer Boettcher pointed out the painfully obvious confusion of rifle and shotgun. This is not terribly technical. I could not decide what flavor residency Sara completed. Was it surgical? Peds? And it is totally unrealistic to segue into forensic pathology (without residency training). I did enjoy the novel. Take heart Ms. Slaughter, James Patterson doesn't know that revolvers and pistols are not the same!"
5,Awesome Athletic shoe,I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them. Good support in the arch and heel and no rubbing. The spikes are pretty sharp so they make good trail running shoes. You can take the spikes out with a key (provided) and they make good track shoes.
3,"Great movies, not so great triple feature","As expected, these discs are just a repackaging of the currently released discs. As such the transfers are still just so so and Escape from Alcatraz is non-anamorphic widescreen (that's always a disappointment). These films deserve far better treatment a far as a proper disc release is concerned, but if you're a fan of the movies and don't want to wait for the next re-release of the films then it's a good buy."
3,Relaxed Incredibles,"An easy-going record this (for ISB that is) with the notable exception of the haunting and mysterious ""Vishangro"" - one of Robin's finest songs which would not be out of place on Wee Tam & the Big Huge. ""Waiting for You"" is a fun song which actually works, and ""All Writ Down"" chugs along nicely, a surprisingly ""normal"" song and very easy on the ear. Much more challenging is the soundtrack to the fantasy sequence from the film...I must admit it held little appeal for me until I finally got to see the film on video. It makes a bit more sense then, although the overall feel, in keeping with the film, is rather amateurish. Still, a welcome release on CD and worth adding to the collection. Great sleeve notes, too."
1,Not as titled,I returned this book as it is not as described. It seemed to recommend excluding rather than including students with disabilities.
3,Just okay,"I was a little disappointed when I read this book. There is a lot of good information about removing toxins from the home, ones that most people don't think about such as plastics in fabrics. However, it seems to be a little outdated as far as cleaning goes. There are many non-toxic products on the market today, such as Folex for carpet and clothing stains and Method cleaning products. I know it's impossible to keep up with the new products that come on the market all the time, but I was expecting a little more advice about ""green"" cleaning. The author mostly suggests things like using baking soda and vinegar to clean with and hot water to kill germs. It would also be helpful if websites were listed for the recommended companies (if available). If you are someone with serious chemical allergies, this may be what you're looking for. But for someone looking for cleaning advice, I think books like Queen of Clean offer a little more detail on specific cleaning jobs."
3,Some Good Info; Ms. Dadd is toxic though,"Whilst I applaud Ms. Dadd for writing this book (she obviously saw a need and filled it, as well), it's hard for me to take advice seriously from someone who is so obviously very toxic themselves even though there is good advice in the book."
5,the Tent of Abraham,i am looking forward to this read. we were supposed to read this one in a group at my church but that hasn't happened yet. i will give it a little more time and then start it myself. i have read a little bit and am excited to finish it
2,not good,hi was disappointed was a cheap made in china product very poor and will be put in the rubbish. was not decribed well at all!
4,Classic Mid-Century Mod,"Great photos and stories about Eichler and his architecture. A bit pricey, but a nice hardcover book usually is."
2,Brace,"Still trying to get use to. i must be wearing it worng, because it's very difficult to grasp my club correctly. Didn't provide any instruction with purchase."
2,Greg Norman's Secret,"Everything with the product was great. But I didn't receive everything that was in the product description. The video tape was not received, even though it said it was included in the purchase."
3,Norman's Secret,"It is a good idea, but the angle is a little steep to the point of discomfort. It does get the job done though."
1,Sun Faded on one side,"Apparently this was old stock from someones window that got sunshine. The parts that were exposed to the sun were faded.I mean FADED. It makes a great work shirt if you are sure to get grease on it, other than that Its a rip-off."
5,"Great shirt, epilets hard to find","Nice look, very accurate sizing and perfect if you wear a side arm. Extensive color selection makes these shirts a first choice."
1,Does any one buy it yet,I am waiting for some one to buy it i wish this was available at B & N to atleast see before i could spent money onit
4,Reviewer above doesn't know Opera,"First off. Ms Follman is a Spinto and sings controlled throughout all 11 cuts. The music is soothing and she would make Puccini proud. If you followed her career, you would no that Ms. Follman sings Tosca's, Butterfly's and Boheme's all over the world. Have you sung on any stage lately? Yves Abel conducts beautifully and brings alive the 88 piece English Chamber Orchestra. What a treat to have so many rare pieces on one CD. The CD insert is written in Italian and English. This CD is a great collection of wonderful Opera that has been lost and Ms. Follman had the ability to bring it back."
1,Photos don't fit album!,"This album is supposed to store 4x6 photos. Unfortunately, 4x6 pictures do not fit in the photo sleeve. I have to trim each picture approximately 1/4-inch to use the album. I previously wrote a review praising this company for their quick service and detailed packing of the album. The album is beautiful, but I would not have ordered it, if I knew I would have to cut up my photos."
5,This is NOT Delirium.....but Solarium Delirium,"This album is NOT the music from the live Delirium concert show (the Cirque du Soleil website clearly states that). If you're looking for the live concert music, then you need to pick up ""Delirium"" (it has a blue cover), not this album because it's from Cirque's ""Tapis Rouge"" collection...which are remixes!I state this because at least one reviewer blasted this album but clearly doesn't realize they've purchased the INCORRECT music...reading is fundamental.With that said, this album is really funky! Kind of on the chill out side of things at times, and it's a good lounge piece if that's your style."
5,Waldron Scores Big with Movie Soundtrack,"Long out of print, Mal Waldron's score for the circa 1965 film ""Sweet Love, Bitter"" (adapted from John Williams novel, ""Night Song""), brilliantly captures both the heart of the film and the jazz mode of the period. Often dark, at times frenetic, Waldron's soundtrack is superb jazz on its own. I listened to the recording many times over a 35-year period before finally locating a VHS copy of the film. The film itself is a tour de force for both Dick Gregory and Don Murray, but the soundtrack overshadows even their fine performances. Apparently, a CD of the soundtrack was issued in Japan in the 1990s, but is next to impossible to find. Sad, because this is outstanding jazz masterfully performed by Mal Waldron. We can only hope that Impulse, Verve, or some other jazz label will reissue ""Sweet Love, Bitter"" -- this is jazz that will never wear out (though, regrettably, my vinyl recording is getting there)."
3,it was ok but a bit cheesey,I liked how the movie began and even the middle was entertaining once the movie started to reveal what was going on and who was misleading who...it got cheesey. The green glowing smoking couldron underground was cheesey. The monster who came out of the couldron was cheesey...needless to say when Chole fought the monster it was cheesey. If they had done a better costume/make up job on the monster I would have enjoyed it better and I do with they had not included a couldron that glowed green with smoke coming out of it.
5,What a trip!,"Growing up in the 60s and 70s, this DVD package has ""special"" meaning. Going to give it as a Christmas gift to a friend...thank you Amazon for making it available!!"
1,Cheaply made,This item for my Sony Ericson phone lasted me about two months and then the cables got messed up. I could only hear one side of my headphones. I was concerned the moment I got the headphones in the mail because the cables for it seemed twice as thin as the original Sony Ericson equipment and boy was I right to be suspcious. Poorly constructed. Why doesn't Sony Ericson sell their original accesories for their phones?
1,Doesn't fit,The product description for this product claims it is compatible with my phone (Sony Ericsson K750i) but it is not - the plug simply does not fit.
4,Inexpensive and works.,Allows me to use Shure in ear microphones to listen to the radio. Sound greatly improved of the marginal headphones that came with the phone.
2,"Great playing, but not a great traversal of the S&P's.","I am in complete agreement with Mr. Larson's review. Fischer plays the notes impeccably, but there's a complete lack of spirit, drama, flexibility of tempo, and contrast of color and dynamics. Her playing is metronomic, turning some of Bach's greatest music into a series of student exercises.There are plenty of technically adept violinists with the technique to play this music flawlessly, but who have more to say interpretively (try Szeryng, Ehnes, or Tetzlaff, for examples). And then there are those who are slightly less than perfect, like Gidon Kremer, whose Bach is breathtaking beyond works."
5,Heavy duty,I bought two of these and put all the CDs out instead of keeping them in the box. The cd rack is very decent to look at. And it doesn't occupy much space. I would highly recommend it.
2,Not worth the money.,This will be short and sweet. This product stinks. Put your CDs in the slots and shortly thereafter it will tip over. This is definitly meant for someone who wants to MOUNT a holder on the wall and not place on the floor.
5,Great for wall mounted or lay-flat storage,"I had these on the wall (they are easy, and quick to mount) and they make your cd collection look great, and easy to re-sort. Now I have them under a bed and, again, it makes your collection really accessible while taking up a minimum of space. I have over 20 of them now and couldn't think of a better way for a serious collection to be stored."
4,great product,"I own two of these. I mounted them on the wall. I think it works great. It is attractive, sturdy and has little wasted space. It is a great family product."
1,Wish I hadn't ordered,"The product that I received is not what I ordered. It is not big enough to hold 35 cd/dvds, it came with no hardware to mount it, it was packaged poorly so one of the rungs was bent, and it is not big enough to hold cds or dvds like the pic shows. Do not waste the time or money on this. I did my research and have 4 other wall mounting cd/dvd holders and absolutely love them and though this would be the same however, I was very wrong and cannot even use this one."
1,92 minutes too long,"Story was boring. Production was amateurish. Suspension of disbelief would have required strong intoxicants. Semi-comprehensible plot helped to mask the many weak points: Refrigerators that apparently float away, a lost shipwreck that should have been as difficult to find as a beached whale, and villains who expire merely by falling overboard. (Despite their shipboard lives, they apparenlty had never learned to swim.) The special effects would have embarassed Ed Wood."
5,Excellent Driver!,This is a quality unit. No added noise. My head unit does not have a control for my sub bass. This unit allowed me to increase my sub signal.
1,"If you love the lore and legends of Unicorns, stay away from this ugly deck.","I am not sure what other Tarot decks or art the other reviewers have seen, but this deck has just horrendous art. Badly drawn, bland colouring. Horrible! And as far as a reading deck, it's a very boring one. The Emperor and the Empress look EXACTLY the same. Same comstume, same face even...just a little different style robe and well name. Ridiculous.This deck looks hastily done and thrown out there. Obviously no research on unicorns either. Unicorns as mythlogical beasts have a wonderful, profound history and lore. None of which you will find here. Sad.I am stil waiting for a really well drawn and researched Unicorn deck."
4,Good gem for any Traveler.,"The CD is basically just a plain interview with Brendan Hill (drums) and the late Bobby Sheehan (bass). I think most people that aren't die hard Travelers like myself will say it's slightly over priced (maybe $9 at the most is what it should be) but it is a great collectible for any fan. It was done almost immediately before ""Run Around"" became the hit it was so they weren't officially rock stars yet. The CD offers insight into their early days and opinions on musical matters. I really enjoy listening to it occasionally just to hear Bobby's voice again."
1,Looks at Gould in all the wrong ways,"I am a die hard Gould fan. I have about 20 recordings, biographies, and all the recent videos that have come out. This is the worst movie I have seen so far. I did not even finish it. The reason is simple. It looks at Gould more as an oddity than a prolific artist of the 20th century. It discusses things such as his love life. Nobody needs to know about that. I care about Gould as an artist and as a man but not about his private life. I thought that this movie would give me something new about Gould but it did not. This is not the right movie for a true Glenn Gould fan. I would recommened Glenn Gould: The Alchemist if you really want to see Glenn Gould the man and the artist. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE"
2,Cheap DVD... You get what you pay for!,"This is a pretty routine slasher pic. Some college students on Spring Break in Florida start getting bumped off by a masked killer. The acting is actually a little better than average for a low budget horror film, but the main problem here is the script. Too many loose ends! I still don't know what the titular secret was!"
3,Do You Wanna Know A Secret,"This movie has it's own high points and low points. The lead female character is no Jamie Lee Curtis but for what the movie is it's okay. It gives you the feeling of an eighties classic like ""Prom Night"" There are a few scenes that make you jump but thats's about it.The not so good things are the fact that there is only one good and gory death scene in it. The rest just kinda' happen when your not looking. You kinda' think you know who the killer is but then you get surprised because the killer is someone unexpected. The acting isn't terrible but it could definently improve. There isn't any good scary music. And for all you ... viewers who watch horror movies for nudity your out of luck because there isn't any.The cover is a little deceiving in the fact that it makes it look like some sort of ""Scream"" remake but it's not. It's your average straight to video slasher movie."
2,I'D LOVE TO KNOW THE SECRET,"Joseph Lawrence looks great in his new buffed up bod; the girls are also quite attractive, including the lovely Dorie Barton. Jeff Conaway looks like he's on Prozac, and we have Chad Allen as the seemingly strange bad boy. The pacing in the first part of the movie is very slow, and even when it picks up, it's with such erratic plot jumps that it's impossible to keep up with. By the bloody climax, we're told what the secret is, but what's the big deal? Manipulative, average acting, and no real surprises.Rent, don't buy."
4,NOT LIKE THE OTHERS,"I thought ,when I bought this movie, that I was buying another slasher flick, of which I am a huge fan. This turned out not to be the case. This was not a horny young victims movie. It actually was well acted and well written. As a black man though, I must say,Oz, the black football quaterback, who was built like Hulk Hogan fought like Richard Simmons. Everytime someone raised their hand he lost conciousness. I did not expect a grown up performance from Joseph Lawrence. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is more than the average slasher flick. I hope there is a sequal, but not to soon though. Maybe in the interim someone can teach Oz how to fight. Maybe if we were not saturated with ""teens gone astray only to be cut up in their prime"" movies, this one would have stood out more. I will certainly be watching this dvd again and again.I am also happy that this slasher flick is cleaner than most, not over sexed and over violenced."
1,Don't Bother.,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made...Even for those of you smart enough to know you're watching a bad movie just from the description on the back, it's still REALLY bad.Unless you happen to be the biggest Chad Allen (it could happen, I suppose.) fan out there, don't bother wasting your time."
5,"Find a Copy, It's Worth It","What a gorgeous book! It's written by one of SoCal's definitive nature writers, Jerry Schad, and sprinkled with beautiful photos from various sources.The first several chapters deal with desert ecology, and the geological processes and botanical survival tactics are really well described. In fact, as an overview of the subject, I haven't read anything as concisely interesting.Remaining chapters discuss various parks and desert areas in further detail, with references to highways and access roads for those who want to visit.The photographs throughout the book are very descriptive and really invigorate the text. The generally accesible format and ""info boxes"" make it almost like thumbing through a magazine.Although I would recommend this book to anyone, I especially wish it were on school library shelves for its first-rate descriptions of desert ecology and enjoyable format."
5,Eagle T-shirt,This is a beautiful T-shirt for the patriotic or bird enthusiast. Well-made. I bought it for my husband for Christmas.
5,nature boy,"Very nice well made t-shirt.I feel more in touch with nature reality and the living.Skeleton and skull Ts are so popular.But represent death,and evil.Sign of the morbid times we live in.Why anybody wants to show of a screen or tye print of our human bones along with other bloody, teeth bearing demons is beyond me."
5,Andrew Lloyd Webber's Secret Gem!,"I bought the musical on a spur of moment impulse yesterday and couldn't be happier! Michael Ball is exceptional with his strong and moving voice - his rendition of LOVE CHANGES EVERYTHING is exceptionally moving. Diana Morrison and Zoe Hart (as JENNY DILLINGHAM) are delightful and truly should get greater credit that is due them. I love - MERMAID SONG, the scene in Jenny's bedroom, and the scene on the terrace where jenny begs with alex to remain with her. You'll never regret the purchase if you buy it! Ann Crumb is inspiring as well as the actress Rose. You'll be touched with her performance during ANYTHING BUT LONELY. :) Buy and enjoy!"
5,EXCELLENT !,"Andrew Lloyd Webber made it again. Much better than the overrated CATS, this musical brings some memorable songs such as ""Love Changes Everything"" and ""Seeing is Believing"" wich are oftenly found in Broadway selection albums. Besides, the story is very attractive and the staging seems to have been very suggestive, despite being a ""chamber"" musical. It's a pity that it became a flop."
2,"2 CDs, but only 3 tunes","Webber has written a few pretty melodies for this show, but that's where he stops. I found this 2 CD set to be nothing more than the same 3 songs, over and over again, usually with different lyrics (but not always). The only redeeming feature is Michael Ball (Marius from Les Miz) who sings the role of Alex beautifully (as if he could sing any other way)."
4,Underrated but still good,"Aspects is not the best Lloyd Webber, that's for sure. And, it was basically booed off the Broadway stage by American critics. Yet, it does contain some of his most touching melodies and a fasinating and complex (weird too) story line similar to the work of Sondheim. All in all, it is certainly worth buying."
4,"It may not be one of Webber's best, but it still great.","This may not be one of Webber's best scores, but it is still worth adding to your collection. The story, though somewhat bizarre, has meaning to it and so does the music. My personal favorite songs include ""There is More to Love,"" ""Other Pleasures,"" and, of course, ""Love Changes Everything"", which just happens to be my parent's love-theme. By the end of the score, you will have skipped a few songs because of thier repatition, but many lovely melodies will stay in your mind forever."
5,His most heart-felt effort,"This is Lloyd Webber's finest and most operatic score. It is also one of the two scores for which he felt his strongest personal commitment, the other one of the pair being Phantom of the Opera, effectively Lloyd Webber's autobiography. Aspects' score is not immediately accessible, an indication of its quality, in my view. Listening to it has a cumulative effect. Puccini might be a safe comparison. Its libretto is the best one Lloyd Webber has had the opportunity to set. That has been a consistent problem for him. The libretto here is by turns droll and profoundly moving. It does great credit to David Garnett's novella, Garnett being a lesser light in the Bloomsbury firmament. If you enjoyed Phantom while regretting some of its too frequent concessions to popular taste, then perhaps you would appreciate Aspects. Be forewarned. It is sublime. But grand set pieces are nowhere to be found."
3,Harry Potter Sequel/Social Network Scenes????,"seeing the formal 'cafeteria' requirements for the robes, long tables close together and food scenes reminded me of the first Harry Potter film, wth?, all the professors full of themselves in grandeur of the ancient campus etc., and the race between Harvard and Oxford was highlighted in the Social Network but the Harvard guys wore the Oxford jackets, go fig... Rob Lowe, a Dego, hmmmm, blue eyes, aqualine nose, thin lips, don't think so...and who thought that baby blue/pink striped scarf was hot looking??? impressed with his welding abilities and the blowtorch he packed from Vegas to repair the sportscar lol, and was surprised to know that some of the scenes were actually filmed at Oxford... really kewl perspective of campus life, dorms, countryside, etc., love 80s films and want to see this one again, and glean other gems of higher learning from this quirky script."
5,The search is over,"I first heard this recording close to 40 years ago when a friend played it after purchasing the record from a cut out bin in a department store. I was glad to see it re-released as a CD, still a favorite and nice to see it on the CD format."
3,Knows the Corps of the Korean era.,Displays problems of promoting enlisted men to the commision grade.
2,Formula driven,"The pianist is clearly one of those talented guys that you can sit down in front of a piano and say, ""Charlie, make the Anvil Chorus sound like Happy Birthday."" and with little effort he can.The problem with that is, there is a sameness to every piece that says, okay let's do everything up tempo, throw in some percussion and go home.It isn't the pianists fault, he did what the arranger asked for, but Latin? Not likely!"
4,A fun band,"Saw these guys at the lauch party for their album. Very fun show and cool music. I don't even like punk in general, but they mix in enough good ol' rock n' roll that they appeal to a Led Zep and Rolling Stones fan like me."
5,i love this,"if you is a old punker like me you will love this every now and again a band comes along and makes me smile,just buy the dam thing,you know you want to..."
1,wrong answers,"This book was a little helpful at best. There were so many grammatical errors, and just plain wrong answers. I would not recommend this book, and I think the person who wrote should have spent the money to have the worked checked. A mistake here and there... no problem, but this thing is riddled with major errors."
3,Thorough but not an easy read,"If you have a rotator cuff tear, as I do, this book is helpful. It is very thorough about the structure and function of the shoulder, but not too clear on what to do about it, except for a description of the Codman exercises, which I have found very beneficial. It seems to have been written mostly for medical people. It could be better on the nuts and bolts of treatment. I recommed buying the 7 Minute Rotator Cuff Solution along with it.Neither book talks at all about supplements. I recommend reading The Miracle of MSM and taking supplements that reduce inflammation and improve joint pain."
4,Carole Short Gown,"The nightgown is very well made and very soft, which is a plus. It's shorter than expected, but still ok. I like the long gowns, and assumed by the picture this was what I was getting."
4,gowns,"I orderd 4 flannel gowns for my mother online just by looking at the photos and reading the description. Was told they were very pretty, she liked them and she looked pretty with them on. She is 97 years young!"
5,where are they now?,I remember Standstill going to Cali to record and such and then they disappeared! They were soooooooo freaking great!! I thought for sure they would make it! Where are you Standstill?
3,Got this as a gift - great but. . .,"I recieved this as a Christmas gift. It is a nice fridge, but a bit backwards to me. The smaller section up top is intended for reds and the bottom for whites. Everyone I know drinks way more red so the space is a bit confining for me. The thermostat doesn't have enough variance. The temp up top is still colder than I like to keep my reds at! Overall quite nice and an exceptional value - just wish I had had unlimited funds to get a truely exceptional product."
3,Elegant design but cheaply made,"It looks really classy and elegant in the photo but it is not crafted very well. Think asian gift shop quality. The leatherette exterior had dents in it and the interior piece was roughly cut. Brass highlights are nice and it comes in a black cardboard box. At this price, I didnt expect too much anyway."
2,No victory!,This book is for someone who DON'T want good and exciting informations! The pictures are good!
1,Great music. Poor mastering.,"Is it possible to ruin music while trying to improve it? The answer is most definitely ""yes!"" I was looking for a clean copy of ""My Heart Stood Still"" and ordered ""20 Best of Artie Shaw."" The price was right but these classic Shaw tunes have annoying ""digital artifact"" throughout. Subtle audio ""bumps,"" ""squiggles"" and single channel drop outs become very apparent with headphones. The only ""liner notes"" in this CD is a paragraph touting ""...ground-breaking, high resolution 24-bit/96-KHz mastering technology."" ""Hooey"" I say. Anyone familiar with Shaw's ""Perfidia"" will notice a few notes spliced out of the intro as well. In short, if you have a ""tin ear"" this CD may sound fine, but otherwise, save your money."
4,Very tight fit in my water carboy.,I am using a 5 gallon glass water bottle for brewing. This fits very tightly in the neck. So tight it is hard to get in and out. But I guess it is supposed to be a tight fit.
5,does the job,"I'm pleased with these carboy bungs, they fit the 6 gallon carboy I have very well. I thought the 3 pack wasn't necessary, but now I'm glad I have extras."
3,Don't buy if you are planning on using for the mason jar reCap lids,"It doesn't fit, I believe these are size 6. If you want to use them in your reCap lids then find a size 5.5"
5,Does what it supposed to do,It simple and easy to use fits great in both of my glass carboys 5 gallon and 6.5 gallon. Great.
2,does not fit all jugs / carboys,"I have a one gallon carboy (small) and these stoppers did not fit. They just barely made it into the opening and then kept popping out due to lack of pressure. Overall I suppose I could have boiled these in hot water and molded them to my carboys, but I was hoping that they would fit small carboys as advertised."
3,"Good product, but I ordered the wrong product","I ordered a 6-gallon Better Bottle carboy and these stoppers plus some airlocks were shown in the ""order this product with these items for this price"" area and I went ahead and added to the cart. I did not look to make sure they were the correct product. I just assumed that Amazon would pair the correct stopper to the bottle.I will not make this mistake again.The product was sent promptly, packaged well and I'm sure the product itself is good. I'm keeping them on hand for possible future use. It just wasn't what I was expecting.I give three stars for Amazon's confusing product placement."
4,One size doesn't fit all,"This fits my one gallon carboys with a little effort. I was hoping to use the extras on the five gallon plastic carboy (better bottle), but it's a bit too small. You win some, you lose some. All of the different kinds of 3 piece airlocks I have fit the drilled opening perfectly."
3,Does not fit plastic better bottle,"Fits a glass carboy fine, but are too small for the plastic better bottles. I would recommend getting these only if you plan on using a glass carboy."
1,Unable to keep in Carboys,"Item was purchased from Learn to Brew LLC. I received my items promptly and well packaged. While I will be ordering from Learn to Brew, LLC again, unfortunately, I won't be wanting more of this product.A 1-star rating because the ""Carboy Bung Set"" did not stay sealed when inserted in any of my carboys which are either 5 US Gal or 23 Liters. The bungs when inserted dry or wetted with sanitizer and with or with-out having a 3-piece airlock installed in the bung when inserted into the carboy.The problem seems to be based on the design and material. I'll be sticking to the standard drilled rubber stoppers in the future."
2,Poorly Designed Bindings,"The snowshoes are well made and I would love to be able to give them a positive review. Unfortunately the bindings do not keep the snowshoes aligned correctly with your boot. After a short time using them, the snowshoes will be angled to the side. I tried everything I could think of with adjusting the binding and was beginning to think it was just a problem for me. But then I found an online outdoor magazine'e review and the reviewer reported the exact same problem. He had several other people try the snowshoes and they all had the same problem. Hopefully Redfeather will redesign the bindings on this otherwise very well made snowshoe."
2,Man it took a long time for this guy to figure it out,"For Christ Sake, get to the point already. That was what I kept thinking when this young idiot is trying to find an ass clown. Then it gets really lathery preachy. I was just like okay okay, by about page 205 of 310 I wanted it to be over already. I had to finish. I thought I was finished then it got really preachy. Just way way too much soapy soap soap."
2,Maigret,"So-so, not very atmospheric, cases rather typical. Acting good but lacks the texture of the novels. Soewhat disappointing. Would not purchase more of the series."
4,True to the books,"I have read all of the Maigret mysteries available in English, and seen the English language films. These are far superior and very true to the books. No movie can quite capture the subtle psychological sense of the books, but these do a good job."
1,maigret vol. 1,Found the films to be very dated; the music to be very repetitive; the acting very stylized. Pricey set was very disappointing.
3,Maigret - Better if you speak French,We originally had the English version of Maigret with Michael Gambon. We enjoyed it a great deal and were looking forward to more Maigret mysteries. Set 1 has some of the same episodes but the sub titles made it hard to follow the story and enjoy the characterizations and cinematic approach. There is much less production and the color of the DVD appear washed out. The French version is a little more direct and gritty but seeing the different approach was enjoyable.I think if you speak French and don't need to depend on the sub titles this would be a more interesting series. The cultural differences are intriguing but I won't be buying any additional sets. My sister speaks fluent French and I'll give them to her to review. She's been to France multiple times so her input will be interesting.
3,Brilliant but not great listening material,"I must confess, I think the show itself is one of the best thins thats happened to broadway. Unfortunately, the CD is not. I enjoy many of the songs & the CD is well recorded, but after about a week it was taken out of my book of cd's and place back in the case."
5,Wonderful,"The Producers is a GREAT example of a wonderful musical. It is one where you will find nonstops laughs and you will be singing the songs once you leave the theatre. Mel Brooks has created a masterpiece, especially with the score. It is amazing how there are a variety of different styles of music, and when listening to it, you cannot help but think, hey this songs reminds of Webber, or this song reminds me something of what Julie Styne would have wrote, or perhaps even a Sondheim song thrown in for good measure. The show is better the soundtrack. But this gives you just a small glimpse of the greatness of the show."
3,Fun for the Young at Heart,"It's crazy, it's zany, it's Mel Brooks.Personally, I find Sondheim's ""A Funny THing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" to be far superior to this show in wit and cleverness. Yes, Springtime for Hitler is a hoot. And ""Keep it Gay"" is among the rest of this show's 8th grade hilarity.Sure, there is nothing wrong with dirty humor. And Mel Brooks- great fun.But not a number in this show even approaches the wit and charm of ""Comedy Tonight"" or Everybody Ought to Have a Maid.""This show is a really great concept blown about with some lotsa flatulent jokes. An overwhelming number of people are crazy about this show, and good for them...if that sort of comedy sets you off, bon voyage!"
3,I Wanna Be A Producer!,"This show is really made for Broadway fans for really you have to be a Broadway fan to get some of the jokes. This show has become a national hit and it's easy to see why it brought attention back to Broadway with a witty cast, and funny songs.But, really the hype has overdone this show and in my opinon nothing could out shine the actual movie despite the fact the movie only has two songs in it. I was kind of disappointed that ""Flower Power"" was cut from the show but, none the less the show is still great. I really enjoy the songs ""Springtime For Hitler"", ""I Wanna Be A Producer"", ""Deutsche Band"", and ""Till Him.""I'm serverly disappointed that Matthew Broderick didn't take home the Tony for his performance since he did a better job than Bialy in the show.All in all this a C.D that all us musical buffs will love... but, I still I get more laughs out of the movie."
1,The Producers produced a racist insulting play.,"It is in my opinion that the music lacked originality and I found the lyrics to be extremely racist and would imagine insulting to 80 million Germans. I'm sickened by what took place during the 12 years of dictatorship in Germany which ended almost 60 years ago. But insulting millions of people who couldn't control the events going on around them or the people who live in Germany today by producing such a character attacking play with over exaggerated accents and dumb lyrics is counterproductive to creating peace and friendship with people in the world community today. It only shows you that things never change, only the direction of the pendulum."
1,Awful!,I really did not like Producers at all. The cast recording was just boring...nothing new or original and nothing that really grabs you and leaves you stunned and speachless. Oh actually I take that back I was speechless by how terrible this was. To me there isn't anything funny about the Nazis and what they did and to me it's too bad so many people love this immoral show. I was repulsed by how terrible is was and I never need to listen or see it again.
5,A CD for all to enjoy,"Mel Brooks has done it! Where did he go right? Everywhere. The best thing about this CD is that the storyline of the show is embedded in the songs. There are enough lyrics (that will get plenty of laughs) mixed with the singinging to guide you from start to finish. As tickets to the show are nearly impossible to obtain, the CD is the next best thing to being there.Don't expect any classic ballads like ""Climb Every Mountain"" here, but the songs are executed remarkably well by the six Tony nominees. Sorry Matthew, but I think Nathan Lane has just sealed the award for this season. When you hear Lane, and the variety he provides, I think you will agree."
4,Witty and Crude but altogether fun,"Who do you have to [*] to get a break in this town? asks Max Bialystock. Well, that depends on the show your looking to get cast in but enough about that.Nathan Lane plays a delightfully base Bialystock who's mind is mostly on money but sex is good too. He does not have a beautiful singing voice that will make you melt but he does have the personality and presence to fill the room. Lane is one of those actors that deserves to be onstage all the time, screen can't contain him.Matthew Broderick plays the charmingly inept Leo Bloom. Bloom is not a character that can overwhelm an audience but one that your quite likely to fall for if only because he's so pathetic sometimes. Broderick is a perfect fit for this cute and somewhat loserly guy, his voice also manages to hit the whiny tones without being obnoxious.Buy this and enjoy yourself"
2,How much does it cost to buy a Tony?,"This music is truly uninspired and totally undeserving of a Tony for ""Best Original Score."" The music is reminiscent of what you would hear in a Mel Brook's movie, good for its own genre but not worthy of spending $100 to go see on the Broadway stage. The one exciting thing about this recording is the powerhouse performance of Cady Huffman."
5,The Producers - It is ... Unt Vonderful,"We bought the CD to prepare us for the Musical and it has only increased our desire to see the show. It is a wonderful collection of great songs. Telling the story through the words and the inflections of the singers build a strong interest in hitting the ""repeat play"" button on my CD player. Nathan Lane is sensational on this CD and his voice is supurb. I can't wait for the matinee performance on Aug 22 '01"
3,"Good, but what's all the fuss about?","I haven't seen this show. It's probably very hilarious. The music is okay...so what's all the fuss about? It's not a groudbreaking musical by any means.I was a bit disappointed in that 2001 year when the Tonys rolled around and The Producers was pretty much the only show to win awards. I thought there were other great talents out there, like Jane Eyre and A Class Act that deserved recognition.This play, while being funny and often well acted, is merely that, not a work of genius or extraordinary talent. What is this world coming to where Mel Brooks wins a ""Best Score"" Tony Award?I like the music, I like the actors, I like the play, but it's nothing special. Pick up the CD for a few laughs, but you'll get bored after a while."
1,Not quite what the hype states it is,"Don't ask me how I got tickets, but I saw this show pre-tonies. Now don't get me wrong... it's pretty funny, but it does not deserve the distinction of having won the most Tonies. The music is just too campy. Sure, on purpose... but it is sickeningly campy. It's the epitome of the connotation that is attached to the words, ""____________: The Musical"" You won't be hearing many of these tunes at auditions. Go on. Buy it. Because everybody else will, but if this is your favorite musical, you have no idea of what a musical can be. I thought we had moved into an era where the power of music uplifts a story to create what is truly an artform. The Producers is a show; it's not art. It's not very hard for a Mel Brooks to make a bunch of yiddish rhymes and get a show that will be popular in New York City. All in all, The Producers is another example of hype from the critics pushing one show through at the expense of other better shows."
1,Da Woist!,"Not only is the music derivative and clunky, but also boring, the lyrics sophomoric. This the ""Animal House"" of Broad-way musicals. Nathan Lane is, as always, Nathan Lane. Too bad he can't come up with a new schtick! The old one is good but just about worn-out. Matthew Broderick is vocally weak with his only strong point, his looks, of course absent from the cd. Too bad."
5,Feel good Musical of the year,"I just loved the songs and the humor of the musical. It was fun to sing along and afterwards, it just feels good. Mel Brooks did well by me."
5,Gotta Love Mel Brooks!,"The title says it all- Love Mel Brooks. Love The Producers. Love Nathan Lane. Love Matthew Broderick (what a suprise to me how awesome ""Ferris Buller"" was in this musical!)"
4,Not the best,"Okay, MUCHO contorversy over THe Producers. While I don't think it deserves TWELVE Tonys and ridiculously expensive tickets, it's a good show. The hype was for Nathan and Matthew, who gave reasonably good performances when I saw them live, and on the recording. The Producers is definitely worth a listen but I wouldn't pay nearly half a grand to see it front and center"
2,Minority Report,"I know I am in a minority, but I don't know what all the fuss is about. The music sounds very familiar and derivative. The lyrics are often funny but not too sharp or clever. More on the level of Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" humor - people sitting around a campfire eating baked beans and farting. I know Mel Brooks thinks this is funny, but personally I graduating 6th grade a number of years ago."
3,A Very Funny CD,"A Mel Brooks Musical: What could be better? The lyrics of this soundtrack are laugh out loud funny. The music is nothing special, but most definately a worthy buy. NOTE: This is not a clean CD. If you're Jewish, German, Catholic, Christian, Gay, Straight, Male, Female, or Human, you will probably be offended by this Mel Brooks work. But who cares? It's great!"
5,The Producers Original Cast Recording,"Before seeing the show on Broadway in NY, NY, I bought this CD. It is one of the BEST CD's that I have ever listened to. I still listen to it all the time, and I bought it nine months ago. I have burned it for friends and they all love it. The lyrics are so funny and so is the dialogue. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, I give it an 11."
5,Greatest cast album in years,"As a collector and connoiseur of Broadway cast albums ""The Producers"" ranks as pure joy. How could this show miss? It has Mel Brooks who created the zany film in 1968. I have not seen the show yet but the score is ""fun"". Some people have put it down and said it is servicable. It's not Sondheim or Rogers & Hammerstein but it is pure ""musical COMEDY"". Just listening to the cd the songs eventually get stuck in your head. Nathan Lane does a career topping turn as Max Bialystock and Matthew Broderick holds his own as Leo Bloom. The cast sounds wonderful. It's wonderful to have such a great show back on Broadway. It should run for years. If anyone is contemplating getting tickets do it now. I got ticket last week for October. I almost choked to pay the $ but I'm sure it will be worth every penny. Quit reading this and go listen to ""The Producers."""
4,Good enough for a Christmas gift...,"Well, anyway, this is why I bought it for a friend who's planning on seeing the musical in July. Therefore, you could say that this is a two-pronged review in that it's not really a CD I want for myself. I loved Mel Brooks' humor when the original movie came out and through ""Young Frankenstein"", but it's worn too thin and has become too raunchy for my personal tastes.However, for a person who's planning on seeing the production, this is a natural so that one can familiarize one's self with the music before experiencing the stage presentation."
2,NO pattern pullout,"I purchased a 'new'Laurel Burchs Kindred Creatures. After thumbing through the book, I noticed several patterns mentioned there being a pattern pullout in the back of the book. My book had NO pattern pullout. Making several designs in the book useless. What a disappointment."
3,a strange mix,"Some of these songs sound like they came from different eras, some good, some great, some bad. Scott's voice is incredibly beautiful, John has a terrific rock sound, and together they make a marvelous blend, but songs like ""Tell the Truth"" and ""The Seventh Dawn"" shouldn't have seen the light of day, and ""But I Do"" doesn't fare much better. The worst part comes when the lovely ""Young Man Cried"" with it's wonderful moving lyrics, is followed by the dreadful ""Everything's Gonna be Alright""...it's a shock to the senses.Released in 1965, and despite some exquisite songs, this one's for Walker Brother collectors only...get their 1966 recording ""Portrait"" instead, which is fabulous, and released on CD with 12 bonus tracks. It's a classic that will always be a joy to listen to."
4,"Pretty Good, but a few shortcomings.","I used this book for two semesters of German language courses in college. While its not a bad book, the memorization of tables and stuff can be daunting. I thought the descriptions were precise and clear, and the grammar exercises were okay. The problem was the application of grammar was too 'precise'. Ie. there was the constant memorization of tables. This book is ideal for an engineer. Overall, its also a good reference book and is well laid out. A nice touch was the culture topics; however, I would have liked to see something focusing a bit more on conversational practice."
2,Missing DVD and Key Code for Online Workbook,"Wie geht's?During my first class today, I was informed that this textbook was to arrive with a dvd and a keycode for an online workbook that is required for class. I cannot figure out how to inform amazon about this problem, the only option is to return the book, but I need it for class. It would be nice if someone for Amazon contacted me. Thank you!!!"
5,Great text for an independent learner,"I bought this text to support my Rosetta Stone German training. I even bought the companion online subscription, which has been really helpful."
3,"Fair Quality in book, Great quality in Education","Product was not quite as described in sale, had writing and damage that was not noted on the product details, but was a great price. Very useful in my German class, very good for high school and lower level college courses in German. CD is helpful, but if you really want audio aid order separately the Lab manual and the audio tracks that correspond!"
2,"An outmoded approach, not at all communicative","Wie geht's has many strengths--including its use of realia and images of modern Germany. But its over all concept is totally outmoded: no German teacher coming out of an education program will have been trained in this methodology, which is not at all communicative, and most of the language exercises built in are of the ""mindless"" variety--you don't have to understand what you're doing to perform the task at hand.Ultimately, I think ""Na Klar"" is the best textbook selection on the market today."
5,"Travel, and History. It's got it all.","I don't know if I'll ever go to Hawaii or not, but this 2 disc set gives an excellent overview. Disc one is the scenic side of Hawaii, showing beautiful highlights of each island. It's pretty in depth, and informative.Disc two is the history lesson. this part is extremely good, and informative. If you've always wanted to know the history of Hawaii (2 hrs), and / or want a good travel log (90 min.), this is the one to buy."
4,Agostino Recca Capers in Salt,I have used these capers for a number of years. They are excellent - much better than those packed in vinegar. This is the best brand I have found.
5,Excellent,"I tried several recipes and my family loved them! I originally got this book from the library, but decided to buy it. We liked the blueberry snack cake, sweet potato fries, and several of the main dishes. The recipes really only take a few minutes, and they are healthy, but not so healthy that my family refuses to eat them."
5,Can't live without it!,"This is by far the most used cookbook I own. My whole family begs for the Blueberry Banana Pancakes daily. Even my ""picky"" eater eats meals from this cookbook and likes them! It makes me feel good about what I feed my family. I also like the ""best of bunch"" section for those nights that I need something convenient and fast."
5,Not just for families with young children,"As a nutritionist, I recommend this book to families who want to eat healthier, but wouldn't feel comfortable at the local health food store buying groceries. I also recommend this book to older adults who due to blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease find themselves needing to change their diets to be more healthful, but have always eaten a traditional meat-potatoes-vegetable meal. These recipes are great for taking recognizable food favorites and making them tasty and more heathful. I particularly love the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe."
4,Good Recipes!,The recipses are healthful and good! This cookbook is a great resource for any family!
2,"Tasteless food, good information","I checked this book out from the library with high hopes of finding new, healthy and tasteful recipes for my family of 5. I have prepared 12 of the dishes and there hasn't been one that I would repeat. I will say that we have eaten most of the dishes, but they are very tasteless and not worth preparing again. The 2 stars are given because of the general information in the book. Definitely get this book from the library before buying. Not worth the purchase if you buy."
3,dissapointed,"I like the idea of this cookbook, but not much I have made from it has tasted good enough to make again. I've tried the blueberry snack cakes, crab cakes, brownie makeovers, sweet and nutty thai thing, honey popovers, baked tofu. The popovers and the tofu did come out good, but the rest was tasteless."
5,Love it!,We got this cookbook after a friend recommended it and we love it. The recipes are easy and simple and really good. Plus I feel good feeding my family the meals in this book; the little changes on familiar recipes to make them more healthy is so great. It's a great book and I highly recommend it!
5,Great Recipes!!!,"I have only made a few recipes from this book, but they were great, easy and my family loved the food--especially the chocolate banana muffins, the blueberry banana pancakes and the chicken nuggets. This book is worth the money!"
5,Fast!,"Quite pleased with it - takes up minimal desk space, and it cranks through at 33 sheets per minute - in duplex, that's 66 pages per minute!!! :) One button push turns up to 50 sheets into a single PDF.I ripped through about 5 years of financial statements in a couple hours over a weekend. Only suggestions might be to include a dust cover, and possibly a larger capacity feeder (50 sheets right now)."
1,Not Quite Steel,"I bought these for cd protection during travel/shipping, thinking steel was a great idea. Might be, just not this item. The case is of a ""binder"" design, each cd sleeve holds two cds and can be removed, which is nice. What is not nice is the fact that everytime I open these cases, all of the sleeves have come out. The binder locks that hold the sleeves, unbelieveable enough, easily come open while the case is closed and the sleeves go everywhere within, when the case is open the binder locks do not easily open and are extremely flimsy and easy to break. Now, don't be fooled by the fact that it is called a Steel Case, it's more like a semi-hard plastic that is quite flimsy and not as protective as one might think."
4,Perfect For My Application,"The CD case has plastic edging and plastic hinges with metal top and bottom covers. I have approximately 10 of these cases which allows me to transport my entire CD collection. They are perfect for my application.If you are looking for a CD case that will survive a nuclear holocaust, then this probably isn't an item you would be interested in."
5,"awesome, one of the best","just all around great is all i can say. too funny, and ""educational"". the best season so far."
2,Disappointed,"The 3rd disc out of the four was so covered in dirt (?), that we had to clean it several timesbefore it would work. Am shocked that it was sent to a customer in that condition."
3,Just wished they'd stick to what they know and leave their political insults aside.,Great shots and portrayal of Vietnam. Jeremy's whining was just a little bit too much though. No doubt the talent and humor of these guys; they are really good about anything that has two wheels or more. I just wished they'd stick to that and leave out the political and and not at all funny ethnic jokes and comments. Somehow in many episodes they (Jeremy mainly) manage to insult somebody for no reason really.
5,"lies, lies, lies","This is truly extraordinary and wonderful film, profound and profoundly depressing, and a perfect antidote to the delusions and falsehood of Hollywood. It exemplifies what makes contemporary Korean cinema so compelling: a willingness to explore human suffering without the promise of redemption --- political, spiritual, or aesthetic. The last shot of the film says it all. And the lead actresses performance was amazing: she seemed so fully consumed by her role that she became a new person as her character changed."
2,I Can't Play It...,"The DVD arrived in the time frame promised and was nicely packaged. However, it isn't in a format that I can use with my DVD player. I understand...it hasn't been released state-side, yet (as I write this). However, the product description should've been more specific."
5,"Brilliant, subtle and realistic...","A heartbreaking, hard to watch performance by Jeon Do-yeon and a story about coping with tragedy and grief and the struggle to find meaning and hope to get you through. Also, the blu-ray picture quality is phenomenal."
3,interesting but sans the english subs,"This truly looks like a wonderful story, but unfortunately I'm not a Korean speaker and the english subs on this DVD are only partially available. Damn. Hope others find full subtitling."
2,Not What I had Hoped,"Despite the appearance of the Eames Lounge on the dust jacket for this book it offers precious little information on this type of classic mid-century modern furniture. More than half of the book is devoted to ceramics and the furniture portion is primarily devoted to designers and designs that you may never have heard of. There is a very brief section in the back of the book that pertains to ""Other Designers"". These ""others"" include Charles Eames and George Nelson!Perhaps the glass and ceramic items and the odd and rare furniture in this book are your cup of tea. Then this book is perfect for you. The format is nice and the photography is well done. However, if, like me, you are into collecting more mainstream ""mid-century"" modern furniture (by such little noted designers as Eames or Nelson) you might want to put your money towards a different book because this volume contains little information you will find useful."
1,Far from what I expected!,"I bought this book being attracted by the subject and the wonderful cover. Inside, I found very litle information on major mid century modern designers and products...If you are interested in very rare and specific ceramics...OK maybe, you might appreciate this book, but for myself, after 5 min, I put it down."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this book. The description does not match the contents entirely. It is very narrow in scope. I was hoping for more thorough information.
2,dissappointed,"I was hoping to find at least some stories of love-attachment, passion, and descriptions of vulnerable, sometimes hot, first time sex or love-making. Out of seven stories I've read thus far, majority seem to come from a porn plot. With stereotypes of loose woman. Like group sex, and the first timer ate one woman three hours, while the other women watched and changed CD, like it was an aerobic event. Seemed more about lust/porn, rather than the feelings that took over to compel a woman to first make love with another woman. So if your looking for some tasteless plots, along with hopefully, ones with feeling, have not read one yet. Keep looking, or write you own book."
5,Loved it,"Wow, this was the first in my books I began reading. Once again loved it. The passion, and feelings totally made me addicted to others like this. Since I've been with my first girlfriend for 6 and 1/2 years I'm totally addicted to knowing when it happens to others. Love it and will look for more.Great Buy"
2,Airpot,"This item worked great for a while and then the spring went on it, it did not last long enough to be worth it."
4,"So far, so good","Only used it over a 3 day period, but it worked well. Kept coffee very hot. Lid removes for easy cleaning."
3,Lukewarm Performance,"The Bunn 2.5 Liter Lever Action Airpot is of solid construction compared to its 'Z' competitor. Had to return the competing brand to Amazon because it arrived with a broken glass liner and its physical construction appeared to be of inferior quality. The principal problem with the Bunn model is its inability to keep coffee more than lukewarm, even with preheating. For those who want their beverage hot this will cause disappointment."
3,Its OK so far.,I thought Bunn products were made in USA and was surprised to see this was made in China. Have used it several times and it does keep the coffee warm after several hours but not really any warmer than the cheap one I replaced it with. I do like the lever better than the push pump type.
5,Sisters of the yam,bell hooks makes you think! which is a hard process to doSisters & brothers should read this material-there is no color barrier here but provoking thinking material.
3,Good for beginning the Self-Recovery journey,"I must admit that I read this book in bits and pieces over the course of a year. In retrospect, I would have to say that a lot of that has to do with the layout of ideas in the book. If I had to describe the nature in which it is laid out, I would say that it closely resembles a dissertation and that can make it a bit hard to stay the course in reading. Throughout the text, there were insertions of sources that could have used a footnote instead to help with the flow.Outside of the layout, I would like to say that the subject was on point with what one can consider a start for self-recovery. I can appreciate the author's personal anecdotes which helped me feel like she does practice what she preaches.This book does make the mark for being a part of one's personal library collection. Take the first to step to Self-Recovery by purchasing and reading this book."
5,2006 Dodge Ram 1500 Mega Cab,"I bought these along with the back seat ones and I could not be more happy, they are great and are really easy to clean. I would recommend these to anyone who doesnt want to replace your floor mats every year."
4,1995 Talladega 500,good movie it showes how MASCAR has come from. in 1985 to today the race could have showen a little more of the race. if you like to see the history of nascar this is a good race to watch.
3,Worth a read!,"From the author of The Secret Garden and Little Lord Fauntleroy is another story built on what is shared between English speakers across leagues of the Atlantic. The niece of a lady in a humble town of England arrives unannounced to tell of her own upbringing. Sure enough, the culture shock yank's through the monotonous fabric of the town's society showing who is pure of heart and who of assumed strong character actually has little virtue."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"The pen grabber is quite a unique item. It serves it's purpose quite well. I bought the Grabbers to keep my pens in one particular place, as I was ever misplacing them. I now have one on my refrigerator, on my computer, in my car. My wife prompted me to by it. I am glad I did."
5,Also holds E-Cigs,"These little buggars, are also great for keeping your E-cig / PV in place. No more wondering where it went. No more rolling off the table. Also useful in the car. These are great, and reasonably priced too : )"
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this item[[ASIN:B001707XBQ All This, and Heaven Too] on June 25th. As of today, July 30th I still have not received this item. Very poor customer service!!"
4,Classic story.,"I love this romantic story about a governess and her forbidden love. I like the message of how we should not judge a person without hearing the whole story. Bette Davis and her co-star, the tragic Charles Boyer, are wonderful actors in the classic style."
3,Authenic rockabilly from Texas,"High Noon is a modern authenic rockabilly band from Texas. They play without drums, like original Johnny Burnette Trio, Blue Moon Boys or some other legendary 1950's rockers. This should be done only if the musicians are very good. And High Noon are good.As I like old 1950's rockabilly, I also like some songs here, and good choice of covers. But let me say - it is a bit boring for me to hear such kinda stuff again and again. Nothing original in general, only imitations. Offcourse, I'm not a judge, but here's my two cents."
5,"First M83 I've Heard, Looking Forward To More","I picked up this CD single recently despite having never heard of M83... very impressive sound, a good blend of uniqueness and catchiness. Even better than the original version of Don't Save Us From The Flames is the Superpitcher Remix (track 3) -- ten minutes of bliss."
4,Conceptually great,"Conceptually I love this book but it was way too wordy and indepth for my 3 & 5 year olds, we will try it again in a few years!"
5,Our Science Book,We use this book as our science book. We read and our children narrate it back! It is a great book!
1,Very Very poor print,"This is like a very bad, hardly legible photocopy. Get another version or from a different publisher. This is just bad. The ink is faint and tiring to the eyes to try and decipher the writ."
2,2nd review,"I wrote a review before and it was not posted. This video for the money was vey disappointing. Some scenes kept being repeated, and for the price the quality was not good. It showed people smiling, close ups and bad views of Lake Chapala which was repeated. My video had blank secions in it when all I got was music. I like the mexican music but felt it was repeated over and over for the whole time. I never lost the audio, just the video. I would not recommend spending money for it, unless it were 10 bucks."
5,Terrific all the way around,"This book caught my eye in the bookstore and the more I looked at it the more I realized how special and important a work it is. Maffit's text is unfailingly clear and on point. Brown's photographs are splendid. The book is organized very effectively. I can't imagine a library that should not have one of these included in its collection. The hidden treasure in the package is the music, contained in a cd inside the back cover. Maffit's compositions and performances are truly world class. Although the book itself is well worth the cover price, the cd makes it an unbelievable bargain. Besides being a marvelous educational tool, it would not be an overstatement to say that the book ""Rhythm and Beauty"" may well contain some of the most astounding music released this year. A tour de force. Check it out."
4,A High-Quality Name-Brand Battery,"This was a replacement battery for my Casio digital camera. My first one (which I got with the camera) wouldn't hold a charge anymore but this was after 3 years of fairly heavy use. I prefer to get batteries which carry the name of the equipment rather than getting a cheaper ""comparable to"" or ""compatible with"" battery. I'm sure they're probably the same thing but I have less confidence in knock-off brand batteries.Although I feel it's worth the added expense, if it were about $10 cheaper that'd make me happier and would warrant a 5-star rating from me."
5,One of the best and most imprtant short stories of the WWII era,"This is truly a must read. Important historically, emotionally and I couldn't put it down. Be warned - I was so disturbed by this book I couln't fall asleep the night I read it."
2,Unenthralling,"Regrettably, I didn't find this tale particularly gripping, nor could I get from it anything substantial about political oppression, as a metaphor or otherwise. The author's literary style didn't set the pulse racing. The story is maybe most interesting as a sensitive observation of one man's neurosis, but I failed to see how that made it a masterpiece."
1,La Heradera,Beware this book is written in Spanish. I did not see anything other than the title to alert me to this fact. It is not unusual for romance novels to be named after places which sometimes have foreign names.
5,Best Value,"For $99, this organizer is incredible. Easy to use, big enough memory for beginner, nice big screen. Use memo a lot to organize floating loose-end thoughts. Still can't believe how inexpensive it was, considering all it offers (phone book, anniversarys, schedule, calendar, memo, to do list, downloadable games (simple but fun), currency and measures calculator, and all still running on 2 batteries from 6 weeks ago. Great for someone who doesn't want to shell out for a Visor or Palm."
4,Good product,"So far this product has met my expectations. MyWizard.com downloads are okay but could have more content. For those on Windows 2000 platform the free Outlook sync software thru Rupplynx does not work well for syncing addresses...you'll have to purchase upgraded version of 6.1. So they say...I haven't tried it yet. But otherwise, sync to Outlook calendar is good, and download from mywizard.com works great--just wish there were better content."
1,amazon let me down,"I ordered two pairs, a total of four. They sent one pair, a total of two. I contacted customer service. They sent out one more. Now I have a total of 3. I contacted customer service again. They sent out a notice that the other one was backordered. I finally gave up. I paid for a total of 4 and have only received 3 so far."
1,Spendy and unreliable,"Great concept: A truly compact folding chair. Too bad they do not last. Had two for about four months -- One is doing fine, but the other would come unlocked when being occupied, and now will not collapse when I want it to. Too bad, because I really wanted to like these chairs."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Not a good product unless you're into performance art. I made the mistake of using this on a camping trip where there was sand. Once the sand got into the mechanism, it was inoperable. It took a whole Sunday morning to disassemble the chair and clean the mechanism. Obviously the engineers didn't do their homework.It's not that comfortable and it'd also a bit heavy. I would suggest that a handle be added to the case, since not everyone wants to carry this on their shoulder.If you're looking for attention rather than usefulness, this is a great product. If used in a CLEAN environment it's not that bad."
5,The book that has helped re-shape my life.,I have read many books on Kabbalah and this one is by far one of the bests! It is easy to understand and does a great job at going in depth into what Kabbalah is and how you can make it work in your own life.
2,basic info but BE WARNED,This book isn't bad as a jumping off point for the basic structure and meaning of each aspect of the Kabbalah. Beware though that Prophet ventures into the realm of applying Kabbalah to the Eastern Chakra system and does so BADLY. All of Ms. Prophet's color correspondences for the the chakras are just plain WRONG. Skip the chakra section altogether.
1,Utterly Useless,"There is no English whatsoever in this package, not on the cassette tape, not in the book. It's all Japanese! (verbal words and writing) So how on earth could you teach yourSELF Japanese, let alone children? I paid $18.00 for this more than 10 years ago; what a waste!"
3,Good Product. Add-on items are overpriced.,"I ordered one of these a few months ago to see if it would work on a project later. When I go to order 20 more of them the price has more than doubled! 1.86 originally now its 3.98 with their ""Add-on Item"" program. (And yes the purchase was from amazon not another seller on amazon.) The product is great for what I need but amazon is getting too greedy. I found them online from another seller with free shipping for the original price I paid for it."
5,"Amazing, but watch out, it's addicting!","In light of recurring news articles discussing the carcinogenic potential of Teflon, my husband and I decided to replace our current cookware. The set we had was in good shape minus a few scratches here and there. If you pay attention, however, these ""minor scratches"" honestly translate to a metallic aftertaste in the food, especially with boiled foods.Anyway, after a long and hard discussion, we decided to purchase this set, specifically with the nonstick pan, since we'd be doing a lot of pan-frying. I have absolutely no complaints about this cookware. It is beautiful, sturdy, elegant, and is truly the way to go for healthy, gourmet cooking. It is expensive, but as other reviews have stated, it lasts the long haul.The only thing is, now that we have the starter set, I've been eyeing other pieces to add to my collection. It's hard to resist. I am addicted to All-Clad!!!"
2,"Too thick, and the pump was bad","The product was a bit thick for my razor, but it did smell very good. The pump didn't dispense well, either, which I think was because of the consistency of the lotion. Not wowed like the other reviewers, so I haven't really used it."
2,Coochy Cream,"I have very sensitive skin and was told this product would 100% prevent razor burn. TRUTH?... It doesn't! I've enjoyed using it, yet I don't feel it's much better than using shaving cream, in fact, it feels like conditioner. Actually, the bottle says you could use the product as conditioner. However, actually using lotion or conditioner in the shower to shave, I could have purchased that cheaper than Coochy Cream. Will not be buying this product for this purpose again. There are cheaper alternatives that work just as well!"
2,Not rash free for me.,"I have fairly sensitive skin and I still get a rash using this. I've given it a chance and used it several times, but it just doesn't seem to help at all. Doesn't have much of a scent either."
3,its alright but i wouldn't recommend,i was under the impression that this stuff was amazing but really its not like shaving cream at all. its like lotion. i just didn't love it and only used about a 5th of the bottle at most.
5,Great go to refrence text for serious cookbook library,"I agree with the other positive reviews written so redudancy isn't necessary. Simple, spare format. Good, accurate information. Tried and tested delicious recipes. I have mixed and matched from recipes all with success and rave reviews. The chocolate walnut crust with the chocolate mousse (made without sugar per recipe) to which I added fresh rasberries was loved by all on Father's Day.My copy is wearing out - love the spiral bound (1991 edition) and I have been asked where to get this so I am very pleased it is offered by Amazon."
2,Not for me,"I love chocolate, so I thought this would be a great book. I bought it new in 1996 and have tried various recipes over the years. It's a book I pick up less and less as time goes by because, so far, none of the recipes have turned out for me. I'll probably give this book away (and pity the poor soul who receives it). I admit to being only an average cook, but I'm best at baking. I gave it two stars because I love the spiral binding and it has a huge selection of recipes. Maybe some of the ones I haven't tried are good (but I doubt I'll try any more recipes from this book). The pages are a cheap newsprint, which doesn't bother me - just thought I'd mention it."
4,Good thermometer once you have practised to use it.,"I have another thermometer which normally takes 15 sec to read the temprature accurately. This one takes 1-2 seconds only. It requires 2 small size battery which are provided. 20 probe covers are also included with the set.Before using the thermometer directly, go through the user manual otherwise you will end up getting wrong temprature. They has given the details as pictures and words which very much explains about the infrared technique utilized in this.I was initially getting incorrect temprature but later on after some practice, was using it properly.A good thermometer for 20 bucks.Only drawback I found, is the battery cover which seems very fragile like other Mark of fitness products battery cover. Why don't they fix this problem :|"
5,Great buy,"This is my first Ear thermometer. I have been using the rectal thermometer on my kid, and now that she has grown I got this better one. I was looking around for different ones - Braun etc and this one is amazing, esp the Swivel tip, it makes it easy to take temperatures even when the kid is asleep. I would definitely suggest this for a first timer ( i paid less than $20 for this ) and i havent experienced any issues with this( I have had it with me for around 3 months now) and use it regularly."
1,keep looking,"i do not enjoy the product. its easy to use but i can take a temperature in the same ear 10 times and get 10different readings. and i apparently have a fever daily, but not with a regular thermometer. user friendly, but for what?"
3,Good quality,Worth the price and functions as described. I use it as a private duty nurse with two children to take vitals every two hours. Not sure about the accuracy though and the probe covers are not easy to find.
4,great but way too pricey!,"This is exactly the kind of album that you tape from your older brother -- good tunes, to be sure, but way too expensive for a disc that tops out after 33 minutes or so. Try Parsons's collaboration with Roger McGuinn on ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" for an honestly-priced disc."
2,Beatles-Lite,"I was hoping for a Procol Harum sound, since all four band members joined PH at one time or another. I was disappointed, as the album sounded more like the Beatles than PH.The final track, however, reminded me of The Worm and the Tree, the whole-side track on Procol Harum's Something Magic album. Perhaps a sign of things to come?"
5,Straight Up,"Thomas Henderson tells it straight up . If you want to know how a man can right himself after falling from grace then you need to read this book . From the top of the mountain , fame , money , prestige , all pro line backer with the Cowboys to a destitute , strung out crack head . Want to learn how this man dealt with his demons ? He takes one day at a time , just like the rest of us . But Thomas makes a pledge to take one day at a time "" sober "" . It's an option , you gotta suit up every day !God bless you Thomas . Keep fighting the good fight"
5,Inspirational,"This book really made me re-think about my sobriety.Thomas Henderson helped me understand better about the 12-steps.About being able to better my life while dealing with my addictions.I really recommend this book for anybody who is going through a recovery process or knows somebody who is,to help them understand what that person is going through in their head."
4,Daily Word handbook,"Those observations given by Mr.Henderson inside ""In Control"" could be used as an anchor by the majority of many of generation of addicts,past and future. With so many people of all ages either struggling or suceeding daily with recovery, it is a must to have a focal grounding point to keep one to their desire of wholesome living. The disease of addiction is a corner that is hard to turn, but with a high profile (no pun) individual relating a tale of victory,many folks can benefit from absorbing Thomas's words.I didn't read ""Out of Control"" however I am glad that I read this book first. I have my own tale of debauchery and dependence and I find much wisdom in his book."
5,Spellbinding!!!!!!!!,"This book was one that I couldn't put down until I finished it. It made me laugh as well as cry. Thomas tells his story with such candor and honesty. I am a member of the recovery community, a very close friend of Thomas' and work in the field of addiction as a Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor. It was like reading a 4th step, one that reveals some of the feelings that occur when one is in the agonizing throes of active addiction. This book should be read by all family members of addicts and alcoholics. It is absolutely BRILLIANT!!!! It should be on the book shelf of every drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, therapeutic community, and libraries in both schools and prisons, all over the world.I also read Out of Control and I think Thomas has out done himself on this honest story of his life."
2,Sexist and trivial,"I bought this book after reading so many good reviews andthought that it sounded like a refreshing change from the romantic,""girly"" books that are currently popular (ie Snow Falling on Ceders, Ya Ya Sisters, books on Oprah's list etc). Sam the Cat was a good easy read for the beach, but as deep as a date with a loud, boozing, soft gutted frat guy with only one thing on his mind (sex)..."
1,The misogyny scares me,"I say right on to the the reviewer ... who calls this book ""sexist and trivial."" There is nothing valuable, interesting or original in Matt Klam's work and his male characters are horrifying and deeply misogynistic. Don't bother with this one."
1,Marketing is killing literature.,"I bet this is some publisher's attempted answer to Sex and the City, mansized, but substitute ""black"" for ""women"" in these stories, and no house would have touched this book. One of the more revolting moments was when a woman was having an abortion, and the narrator ""wanted to shout...get me out of this room before I'm seared and split open, before I develop breasts myself."" *Before I develop breasts myself*? I'd have even stayed with the guy's loathing of women if the writing were interesting, but it's not. Really bad use of bookstore space."
3,contemporary fiction - oxymoronic and caloric too,"who watches sex in the city? at what opportunity cost? yet, a familiarity with popular culture's ubiquitous focus on all-about-town sex enables one to gleefully mock anyone who isn't getting any. for those who are neither glueing their eyeballs to the screen nor the scene, this book is a welcome addition to consumers without an object. a sometimes brilliantly realistic expose of your lover's motivations, vulnerabilities, and lapses of humanity, it offers succinct images of the brainscape addled by pheromones, much as does Lorrie Moore or Rick Moody (if he cared to)."
5,Buy This Book,Matt Klam's stories will make you laugh and then they will make you think. He turns modern urban romance inside out with the precision of a laser surgeon. Klam's often irreverent and profane narrators provide an acerbic commentary on the romantic lives of the young and the rich as they struggle to deal with the spiritual and personal void they find themselves in as they pursue success.
5,Two Paws Up - MEEEE-OOWWWWWW,"Seriosuly, though, this is wonderfully written and powerful book. It's characters are in varying amounts of pain, yet Matthew Klam keeps them from being to depressing -- and allows life to seem quite funny! I look forward to more from him. Also recently read a piece from him in Allure --outstanding and he's very cute too."
1,"Limited in Voice, Range, and Ideas","These stories read like performance pieces. Maybe they are funny to hear read aloud, but they are mostly dead on the page. Same note gets played over and over."
1,Writing programs are killing literature,"I only read one of the stories in this collection, the last one, which was published in a recent New Yorker. It was so lame that some friends took turns reading it aloud. Lines like ""It was like trying to stop a bullet with a chocolate chip cookie"" are still making me and my girlfriend laugh."
3,Be careful what you pick up,"I picked this up second-hand. It was published in 2000. It has 6 rainbow-coloured condoms on the front, still in their wrappers and 3 on the back no longer in their wrappers, possibly used.For this reason I give it 3 stars. If all six condoms had been used it would have got 5 stars, because 5 is the max.This gives you an idea of the kind of insights and humor to expect. Is this fashionable? Maybe it was eleven years ago. Maybe not even then.It's written in colloquial American, which means the sentences are short and many of them contain words which cannot be quoted in this review. I know that for sure because I tried and my review was rejected.I guess this means it's literary fiction. One of these stories appeared in the New Yorker, which kind of seals it.I didn't dislike it but next time I will be more careful about what I pick up and what I post."
5,A funny gothic!,"This is a one of a kind-a funny gothic! Iknow, I know...its a contradiction in terms. The author successfully writes an authentic gothic that reads quickly & is truly amusing. Whether you're a long time fan of gothics or have never read one before, you don't want to miss this one."
4,Your Perfect Right,"Even after assertiveness training classes, I still found value in this book. Wise, practical, with help and instruction! HIghly recommend!"
3,Stick to assertiveness training...,"While I did find this book somewhat informative and useful in developing assertiveness (I wouldn't be writing this review otherwise), I was turned off by the constant insertions of political and moral viewpoints. This book would be just as effective without the subtle rhetoric.Additionally, this book could be heavier on the content. It uses too many references, making it seem, at times, like little more than a reader's digest of everyone else's books on the subject.In conclusion, assertiveness is independent of political or moral viewpoints, yet this book implies that by taking an alternate viewpoint to those presented in this book would be wrong. Isn't that a subtle form of the manipulation that is discouraged in this book?This book would be better with less politics and more original content."
3,typical mccone,"this was the typical mccone book - the mystery was set well, the list of suspects made sense, and the conclusion was well planned out"
2,Pedantic and presumptive,"Although the plot line was intriguing, the author never allows the reader to discover anything on his/her own--every point is belabored painfully. Additionally, lots of lecturing (mostly of politically correct views) finds its way into the text. The author recalls the decade of the 60s much differently than I do. Many of us were too busy to be smoking dope in college or carrying anti-war placards, which seems to be the author's memory. As I've explained to my children, much of what happened is the 60s was terrifying--desegregation demonstrations that involved dogs, fire hoses and deaths, the weekly wail of air raid sirens and radio emergency frequencies being tested, the FBI under Hoover, the spector of the USSR looming over the age. In general, my main criticism is the heavy hand with which the author includes her opinions, descriptions and recollections--if it is necessary to lecture, it should be done lightly and subtly."
4,with good reason!!!,"they say this saying for a good reason! it splaters everywhere, especially on your foot (and even worse if you are barefoot like i am all the time)"
1,Low quality toy,"Before you start investing in a Fontanini Nativity village, be aware that everything except the figurines of people are made in China.Also, the quality of the figurines is about what you would expect from a toy that you would give a three year old child. They don't even sit flat."
4,"Cute and predictable, but fun too ;-)","Kelly did a much better job here than Mariah in Glitter, but she ain't Beyonce in Dreamgirls either. She does a good job at playing a famous singer who falls in love with a guy who is a seat filler at an awards show. This gives her the perfect opportunity to let us hear her great pipes again but on a solo level. The chemistry between her and Derrick (Duane Martin who I love in All Of Us) is believable and fun and while this movie might appeal more to chicks, I think it has a wide age appeal.I dropped a star due to the fact that it's totally predictable, but overall, this is a really cute movie that I recommend to hopeless romantics and those who want to have a laugh. (Also good for Kelly Rowland fans because there are plenty of reminders that her then new album would drop soon). I like it and hope you do too."
5,The Seat Filler,The fisrt time I saw this movie I gave it 100 stars********** I had taped it on my DVR and lost it. I am so glad someone gave me a Amazon gift card and I saw that I could order it and I was thrilled. I had been looking in stores for that last year and never saw it.
5,Great show! Very entertaining for the whole family.,"I really enjoyed this movie because it had a great musical background and theatre approach to it. It showed a star who was looking for love with a busy schedule as well and finds it with a man who is struggling to get his lawyer degree and pass the bar exam. He is seat filler with his friend who plays the woman that he dates.When the two meet, they are instantly attracted to one another and begin to date. The singer however has just ended a relationship with a gorgeous black man who is self absorbed and does not pay her enough attention. He digs into the history of her new prospect and brings the dirt back to her.The ending is great however because of the turn of events of which I will not tell...you gotta buy the movie. (smile)."
2,Reader reviews -- many from one (unidentified) reader?,"As a reader who scrutinizes the reader reviews for books, just wanted to caution others to look at the source on many of the reviews for this book. While clearly not all the reviews seem disingenous, many have similar dates of postings, are very anonymous and haven't reviewed any other books, or recommend this book in all of their other reviews in the same way. Could be just coincidence, but might be an attempt to sell books, too. I take the trouble to point this out because one of the best things about Amazon is the veracity offered through their ""reader review"" section, and I hate to think that it may be being manipulated."
5,Excellent and Well-Written Advise,"Jason provides both motivational and practical advise on the art of finding a rewarding career. He starts with the necessity of truly understanding yourself and what makes you feel fullfilled. Upon that base he then proceeds with builidng the structure of how to find a job that provides you with the fullfillment you desire. Although some of what is in the book could appear self-evident, it is still a good reinforcement and reality check for even the most sophisticated professional."
3,Good addition to the genre,"If this book is indicative of the whole Jill Smith series, then it is a good addition to the genre. The protagonist is an uncompromising police officer in a world where compromise is survival. While the plotting in this book is not compelling, and Jill's dedication to getting to the bottom of the problem is not readily understandable, I would nevertheless recommend this. It has certainly made me want to hunt out and read the rest of the Jill Smith series, and other books written by the same author."
3,Enjoyable for Berkeley ambience and characters,"Narrative drive is strained when policewoman heroine persists in the case - her altruistic devotion to the repulsive Ott is confusing, as is the response of her department to her. But creative handling of secondary characters and the setting make this a diverting read."
1,It's below standard,"It claimed to be an hour show, however, it actual running time is about 37 mins. Worst of all, it so called sizzling stript show is so boring and have a lot of cuts. In fact, Scott Layne didn't show all in this video, if you compare what he did for the magazine. Save your $$$ for a better one. And, I advise you not to expect too high for other Playgirl video product either. If you really like to watch nude man, go for the magazine."
4,Big!,"Movie was focused on revealing the intimate details of Playgirl's Man of the Year. The movie uncovered many of the interesting aspects of this years winner, as well as some runner ups. The movie kept nothing hidden and many of the stars were above average in size. Keep you eye on the second runner up, he was at least a 12 (inches!). Overall, the movie was big and exciting!"
2,impressive,"i have never had such a kind of idea that male bodies could be that attractive to me. Of course, i'm not a gay, but i really appreciate the cool feature of those guys--sexy, impressive and healthy! I'm working out regularly, and probably i will be ""the playgirl's man of the year"" some day in the future. Thank you --editors and photograph designers, thank you for providing us such great video."
3,"A good spiced tea, but...","I used to love this tea, until I bought my most recent box. I had used a few bags of tea and they were good - you could taste the other spices in the tea. However, when I brewed some tea at work this morning all I could taste was cinnamon. It was horrible! Perhaps some of the bags were from a bad batch? The cinnamon oil flavour was just overwhelming and I poured the tea down the drain. I'm now reluctant to use any more bags from this box. Not impressed with the lack of consistency in the quality of this product."
5,Herbal Spice tea,It's a great full bodied tea with Vanilla flavored creamer and sugar substitute. Enjoy it at work if I don't have to go out in the field.
1,Misnomer,"If you are looking for something comparable to the Chai at you-know-where, skip this tea. I bought some after reading the reviews, but felt they really missed the mark. This tea should be simply called ""Cinnamon Tea""--that is the ONLY flavor I taste, and not at all like Chai. Imagine melted Red Hots dissolved in water, and that is about what this tea tastes like. I love Celestial Seasonings tea usually, but this one is really overpowering with the cinnamon flavor, which should be better pointed out on the box. I am going to try their India Spice tea based on other reviews, and will hopefully find something more complex like what I am looking for (and will hopefully be a nice substitute for the expensive Chai from Starbuck's)."
1,vile,"Hidden in the ingredients under ""natural flavor"" is some sort of herbal sweetener like stevia. The taste has a shocking initial sweetness followed by a nasty bitterness. Worst tea ever."
1,"wHAT IS THE RAVE ABOUT? Red hot gum, that's about it!","I have no idea WHAT people are raving about..I read all of the positive reviews only a half hour ago and thought for sure I could add to them. Now that I am back and have finished brewing a cup of this tea, I find that there has never been such an on point review! A cup of red hots brewed in hot water is EXACTLY what this tea tastes like- I could have boiled some cinnamon sticks from the cupboard and got the same taste. Where are all of the other flavors? Um, not here in this tea, I tell you that much! I am NOT sure if this has anything to do with this being the decafe version, but I will NOT be buying this again. I got through the cup by adding some agave and rice milk, but I feell like I just finished a pack of wrigley's red hot gum...what a hot mess!"
1,cinnamon,It's basically the cinnamon challenge in liquid form and it smells like a craft store at Christmas. Won't be buying this again.
4,"Surprisingly good, but could be a bit better","I'm not usually a Celestial Seasonings fan. I find many of their offerings decidedly below par. But Bengal Spice is actually pretty good. It's perfect for cinnamon fans, as that is undoubtedly the boldest taste in this blend. And it's true that you don't need to sweeten it; the cinnamon takes care of that itself.In terms of strength it's nice and bold. The vanilla smoothes everything out though...it's not too strong, unless you let the bag steep for an inordinately long time. But Bengal Spice does have one notable weakness....for those looking for a great chai, you might be disappointed. Because while it's strong and has a nice flavor, the ginger, cardamom, nutmeg etc. is hardly noticeable, masked by the strength of the cinnamon. It's a shame, because this blend is definitely better-tasting than some, such as Yogi's classic India Spice. If the other ""chai spices"" in this blend had been stronger, this would be a 5-star tea."
4,Eye of the Tiger,"Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice Chai is Colorado's laidback take on the Himalayan spiced delight. The Rockies have a passing resemblance to the roof of the world, with its K2 and Everest. Bengal Spice Chai aspires to be at the peak of taste. It is true to its spicy cinnamon flavors--but it's missing an essential element- milk.Oregon Chai Concentrate, Original, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), from the Pacific Northwest, is truer to the Indian original. Celestial Seasonings is best enjoyed while listening to Starbucks' freshly brewedWorld Is India, Putumayo'sIndiawith its rice pudding recipe, andMusic From the Tea Landswith its own recipe for homemade chai. Drink it down!"
3,Very fragrant and cinnamon-y,"This tea is Very fragrant, esp. the cloves and cinnamon, I think the taste takes a little getting used to, especially if you don't drink herbal tea on a regular basis - its strong on the cinnamon !"
5,The box with the tiger,"This is just the best ""herb"" tea! It's actually a sumptuous blend of a few exotic spices, with a kiss of vanilla. It's yummy as a delectable pastry or dessert but it can be brewed up in a few minutes, smells divine, and can be consumed without guilt (read zero calories, fat, sodium, etc.,). If you love cinnamon, you HAVE to try it. The hint of cardamom, ginger, plus a few other all-natural flavors, simply pushes this tea to the top spot on the delight-o-meter.Unfortunately, it can be a bit hard to find outside Colorado.I hope you keep it in stock Amazon. Thanks."
5,Yummy,Friends introduced us to this tea during the summer. She had made iced tea with it. I have never liked herbal tea but this was awesome. I now drink it hot for the winter. I do believe that the herbs used in this tea has kept me healthy from the flu season!
3,Quality is lacking,It can be difficult to find multi gang wallplates. This one looks fine but is relatively fragile and doesn't always sit flush to a wall. Be careful in handling and screwing in. These wallplates crack easily.
1,a groaner,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. Every joke falls short, and my 15, 12, and 9 year old sisters all eventually had to abandon the movie, all declaring it ""the dumbest movie ever."" Sure, there's nothing offensive in it, but there's also nothing entertaining. Steer clear of this film's bad acting, writing, and utter lack of value. There are plenty of good family movies out there. This formulaic groaner is not one of them."
4,For fans of Schubert and collecters of operas,Schubert was not a successful opera composer and his operas are considered to be dramatically weak.This performance reduces the time of the opera from three hours to 2 hours six minutes. Normally this would upset me but in this case I suspect the reduction makes the opera more accessible and certainly doesn't seem to harm it. There is lots of beautiful music and fine singing. The first reviewer has well described the staging which would normally would disturb me but in this case I find it amusing. Since I am a collecter I am glad I got it and would recommend it to those with a substantial budget for music. For others there are so many other fine operas!
2,Where is the choir ?,"The music is splendid but the stage is very poor. Because of producer's ambiguous, abstract concept, we can see only the solo singers. This opera has been written for choir ansamble according to the tradition of Singspiele, Zauberflöte to Meistersinger von Nürenberg, so choir is an intrinsic component of the whole stage. Mysteriously enough, we cannot see even a member of chorus group, the fact that results in a total disappointment. What is the king without the celebration of his subjects on the stage ?"
4,car parts,I have used Fel Pro gaskets off and on for the last 35 years working on cars and have always been impressed with the quality. No different on the head set...I rated it 4 stars...there could have been injector seals in the kit and it would have been complete.
4,Gold And Silver,"i have nothing else to say 'bout this masterpiece, just one thing which anybody seem to know or notice,...that wonderful piece of art called GOLD AND SILVER it's based on DAVE BRUBECK'S TAKE FIVE, which is another masterpiece itself, and if the studio version sounds out of this wolrd, check out any of the filmore concerts of those days ( via any p2p prgram, soulseek for example ;) ) and listen, listen how cipollina and company developes the whole thing, furthermore, they had nicky hopkin's fingers playing in those days, which give the song another dimension."
3,Digital Goo (technical term),The remastering engineers used phase alignment in the upper and lower frequencies to increase the sparkle and power of the recording. Well it is powerful but details are lost and it no longer resembles the original recording. I'm not sure what other devices were used to hype this mix but it sounds like buckets of digital goo were poured all over it.
2,"Actually, I like these guys","They had a swagger at Monterey 67 and were in the right place at the right time. I like about 3 tracks on this album (their first and best). I can't recommend it to the masses, I purchased this mainly for historical purposes. You MUST listen to Jefferson Airplane (first 2 albums only), Peanut Butter Conspiracy (first 2 albums only), Grateful Dead (skip first 2 ablums) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets."
2,music of another time,"Boy, does this stuff sound dated. John Cippolina sounds as silvery as you could hope for, but the songwriting just doesn't deliver on the promise of Cippolina (or the rest of the band) as players. Yet another first-rate live band with third-rate songs. As is still true with most jam bands today, the songwriting takes a back seat to the possibilities the live medium, where the song is just a platform quickly left behind in favor of improvisational flights. In comparison to the wild rococo psychedelia of the Dead's early studio albums, where they made use of the full potential of the recording studio (and had really good songs), this album isn't very groundbreaking or trippy even for its time. This music doesn't stand up to repeated playings in a modern listening context, but, if nothing else, is at least interesting for historical reasons."
4,One of the few recordings of John Cippollina,"The reason I went to see Quicksilver back in the day was to see John Cippollina play, and that's the same reason I've had this studio album in every format it's been released on. The rest of the musicians are OK, the vocals weak, but John Cippollina's talent was on an entirely different level and very little of his work was recorded. The strongest lyrics here are on Hamilton Camp's old folk song ""Pride Of Man,"" but the best QMS moments for me were always instrumental. Dino Valenti was in jail and did not appear on this recording which gets it an extra half star from me. There were better bands overall around back then but John Cippollina didn't play in any of them. This was a great band live so of course their label never bothered to put out a live recording. I still listen to it a couple times a year after 40yrs which can't be said of many other recordings of the period."
3,"How is the sound, and bonus tracks?","Has anyone bought this yet? Is the sound any better than other versions? The bonus tracks look like the ones from Lost Gold and Silver - are they?FYI, I recently bought the ""remastered"" version on BGO, and it's mono! I don't mind mono CDs when they make sense, but this one does not, IMHO."
5,The Fool is a classic.,"The Fool is one of the classics of rock'n'roll. Using the conventional tools of the rock'n'roll genre, e.g., simple chord changes and simple rhythms, this piece of rock'n'roll succeeds in invoking a variety of feelings. At times, The Fool evokes mystery and anticipation. At times, The Fool evokes a feeling of relief and resolution. In my opinion, every time a ""60's"" radio station plays a Led Zep tune, they should also play this number by Quicksilver Messenger Service (but they don't, too bad). Gold and Silver is also abundantly listenable. I seem to recall a recording of Hall of the Mountain King played by QMS on the radio in the late 1960s. Anyone else recall it?"
5,Still nobody quite like Rory.,"With each new Rory album I discover, I'm amazed at how unique a voice she is. This is a worthy addition to her other releases."
4,One of the top three Brother Cadfael mysteries.,"This is probably my favorite of the ""chronicles."" I discovered Brother Cadfael through the series on PBS and went to the books out of curiosity. The books are ever so much better than the television representations, for the richness of history, setting, characterizations, the wealth that Peters can deliver in such ""short"" books. ONE CORPSE TOO MANY is not only a good mystery but a pleasing adventure, a contest of wit and will between Cadfael and the newcomer Hugh Beringar. Even if you don't generally read mysteries (as I don't), this book and most of the others in the series are true delights."
3,Misses the target,"Cadfael mysteries should be about sleuthing around. About telling the reader why something is important without telling them who it points to. Peters generally has us guessing up until the final moment as to the villain. But with almost all of this book being taken up by the blossoming romance between Godith and Torold and whether they escape or not, the actual murder and therefore murderer are only really touched upon in the last two chapters. Unusually, I knew the killer very early on. This was more to do with the fact that there was no-one else who could reasonably be the killer as opposed to my own detective genius. This book left me with the same feeling as watching a film billed as a Schwarzenegger Action-thriller only to find that it was all about rabbits."
4,"Exciting if slow-moving story, likable characters","Stephen's army captures Shrewsbury and hangs the whole garrison that supported Maud. Among the dead, Cadfael finds an extra body who was garrotted rather than hung. He also is assigned a new apprentice with a secret, while two of Stephen's captains are interested in a lovely young heiress.Slow-paced but with enough happening to keep me interested, and Hugh Beringar is a wonderful character - complex and layered, not completely consistent but very likable. It was pretty obvious who the bad guy would be, but the twisty side plots kept me guessing. If I could award partial stars, this one would get a 4.5."
4,Inspired by GKC,"This book is evidently inspired by Chesterton's ""The Sign of the Broken Sword"" inThe Innocence Of Father Brown. The theme in both stories is that of a corpse being hidden in a battlefield. In Chesterton's story, Father Brown asks, ""Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. But what does he do if there is no forest?"" He answers his question by saying in an obscure voice, ""He grows a forest to hide it in. A fearful sin."" In fact, in The Sign of the Broken Sword, the murderer started a battle in order to cover his tracks. Peters uses the metaphor of the leaf also: Brother Cadfael says, ""There is a murdered man among your executed men, a leaf hidden in your forest."""
4,Brother Cadfael series,"The Brother Cadfael series appeals to me as it ties in with both my Welsh background and my long term interest in Genealaogy. The names Ellis Peters used are all familiar as they appear in my family tree and I see [some of] them as old friends. Really old friends. She tells fine tales, uniquely."
5,Panasonic DVD-LV57 Portable,"If you're looking for a portable DVD player, the DVD-LV57 from Panasonic is a great choice. The small 5 inch screen shows crisp, clear images with vibrant colors. The sound is also good. I saw no drawbacks with this little unit and am extremely satisfied with it's performance in every way."
1,This is not an instructional video,This is the biggest mistake I ever purchased in Amazon. This is not an instructinal video that teaches about pottery. It's about a pastor using pottery making process to preach how God transforms and remakes people. There is nothing about how to thown pottery. The pastor is a good potter. But I didn't buy the DVD to hear him preach or see his pottery works.
1,Not What IT Appears,Thank goodness I read the previous reviews before I wasted my time and money on this video. I too am a believer but I also want to learn pottery.They saved me a big hassel. Thanks.
5,Very well done and informative,"This book is very well done and informative in that it tells all the main points about Darwin and his famous theory of evolution, how it came about, as well as the opinions of some of the people who have voiced disagreement about it. The format is a series of essays written by well-known scientists, historians and others. The editor has done a nice job of picking readings that are easy to understand but not so easy as to be on a child's level. There are some serious quotes in there by Darwin and his colleagues and other scientists, as well as some stuff by the creationists, who of course think evolution never happened. This book would be good for students, but adults will get plenty out of it too."
4,"Free Kindle edition not the best, but it's free ~","Some formatting errors aside, it does stick to the script. Like many other free Kindle Shakespeare downloads, it seems this is based off the same version and formatting as the Project Gutenberg website (also free). I would highly recommend putting out some money for the Pelican version if you like this play and want a quality version with footnotes and analysis.Titus Andronicus (The Pelican Shakespeare)But the kindle edition was free and portable, so it's pretty hard to not recommend it."
3,"Extensive, but poorly edited","This book covers not only ASP, but also everything related to it, such as ADO, Index Server, XML, MSMQ, and MTS. It's not a good book to start with, ""Beginning ASP 3.0"" by Wrox is a good choice. Only problem with this book is that there are so many spelling mistakes, it's a joke. You kinda lose your faith in the accuracy of a reference book that way."
5,"I Agree, One of the Best ASP books","I also have the ASP 2.0 Programmers reference, which I use regularily. This goes way further. The information on Windows 2000, Exchange Server, Security, SQL Server 7... Makes it a great all around resource. Covers just about everything you need to know."
5,"Core Methods, Objects Reference.. this is invaluable!!","As an intermediate ASP programmer many times you need to find reference for how to do something in a hurry. Well this book is the answer. Concise clear well organized. Good reference coverage of XML to the end. I've had it for a couple months and it has proven invaluable to me and my team for reference. This book is not designed to teach you to code elegantly and efficiently, but even if you are a seasoned ASP programmer.. don't pass this one up. Definitely a good buy for your reference shelf."
5,A story about a women who weaves stories,"I picked up this book right after reading Hegi's ""Tearing the Silence"" and finished it in three sittings. I'd put it at the level of Robinson's ""Housekeeping,"" it's that good. Hegi's characters are full, complex--real people. And there's so much of their lives woven into the story. It's remarkable. Like other reviewers listed here, I thought Trudi--whose story this is and who learns and tells stories about everyone else--was unique, strong, magnetic, a perfect figure about which to structure a piece about lives in a small German town during the Second World War."
5,Travel back into history,"Stones From the River is a compelling novel that takes you back into history to the daily lives of German civilians exposed to the Nazi uprising. Ursula Hegi, a German-born writer, eloquently masters the English language by literally illustrating the events through her main character, Trudi Montag. Hegi is commended for her artistic ability to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind through the written word."
4,Good reading,"It was a bit hard to get ""into"" this book. The stories within it were mostly tragic. I found very little good in the lives of the characters. It took place in Germany during the WWII crisis. I understood this as I read it. However, I did find it interesting and kept at it until the finish. I would label it a rather strange and different book. It made me want to know more about the author."
5,Stones From The River,"The author has an insightful ability of describing life as Trudy lived it. How her life as a dwarf 'colored her world.' The review of the war, the treatment of the peope, the hardships, the way they dealt with those hardships...I thought it was an outstanding piece of literature."
3,Tell yourself you can finish this book!,"Be cautioned. This story moves very slowly. There is a good tale behind the prose but it takes reading half the book to get the momentum going. It's a large tale because it encompasses many lives which intersect over many generations. Some things I like a lot: the words in German and Leo Montag, the wonderful father figure so often lacking in modern fiction."
3,An eloquent WWII story from inside germany,A very insightful perspective on World War II from German civilians in a small town.
1,Shoot me now,I had to read and annotate this book for AP language/composition. It was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life.
2,Definitely not the best book I have ever read,I had to read this book for summer reading. I am a Junior in high school and I love to read but this this book was just awful and hard to read. The dialogue in this got so far off what the characters were saying that it was tough to remember what situation the charaters were in. The only interesting points in this book was during WWII and that started half way through the book. The book is so sad that it is hard to read because Trudi Montag's life really does not amount to a happy ending. Like I have said this is definitely not the best book I have ever read.
1,death by literature,"Now I am usually a fan of Holocaust books, but I am currently contemplating burning this book. I have to read it for an honors english conference, and my friends and I are all in agreement; this is easily one of the worst books any of us has ever read. It is slow moving and the language isn't captivating at all. The tense changes and overabundence of characters makes the plot (or lack there of) hard to follow. There is also no oppurtunity to connect with the many characters of this book, therefore there is no emotional impact when bad things happen to them.If you are thinking of reading this book, check yourself into an insane asylum. It's honestly horrible"
3,Book club choice,"This was my book club's choice last month, and probably not a book I would have picked up on my own. But I enjoyed it. It was a little hard to read with a lot of German words stuck here and here, and a lot of characters to keep track of. But you were rooting for Trudi throughout the book. Got an understanding for what a small person goes through on a regular basis. It also painted a great picture of Nazi occupied Germany, and not only what Jews went through but how good German people did what they needed to, to survive and keep their families alive. I sometimes wondered what was going on in those towns outside the concentration camps and why they didnt ask what was going on..have a pretty good picture now why."
2,couldn't finish it,"There are few books I don't finish. I was looking forward to reading this book because it sounded like a great novel - fascinating characters, set in an inherently interesting time and place. Unfortunately, I found the writing dull and pedantic. The story is mostly told from the main character's point of view, but her voice does not change from infancy through adulthood. And there are sudden inexplicable shifts in point of view and in time, which work well in a short story or essay format but are annoying in a novel. I think her intent is to foreshadow, but telling us about a future act when the main character is still only 3 is not effective foreshadowing. And I kept remembering my 7th grade English teacher's direction to ""show us, don't tell us"" as to how different characters feel and relate.It was with much disappointment that I finally decided that my annoyance with the writing style was too great. I gave up halfway through and returned the book."
5,One of my top 10 favorites,"This is a rich, colorful story written for everyone who has ever felt that they were different. Hegi brings to life a time and place known to most only through stark newsreel footage."
4,Wonderful characters,"There are many wonderful things about this book, the story is fascinating and the characters are realistic, unstereotyped, and easy to identify with. The main character, Trudi Montag, is a dwarf who collects and shares stories and secrets about a small town in Germany before and during the second World War. She is a very sympathetic character whose life unfolds in the pages of this very well written book. This is my favourite kind of novel, fictional but set against a real and horrifying part of our history. I highly recommend it."
1,It's too bad the author did the audio version.,"Of the 4 cassettes in the audio version, I listened to one. The author's voice never varies and is a distraction to the story. I would like to finish the book. The story is sad yet captivating. I left Trudi between the wars and look forward to more of the story."
2,Hated it.,"I hated this book. I couldn't even read it on an airplane, that's how bad I found it. And I really, really tried since friends had recommended it to me. But after about 1/3 of the way through I found myself thinking, ""What the hell do I care about some dwarf in Nazi Germany??"" I suppose that's not the most politically correct attitude to take but I don't get the hype. I found it extremely slow and easily put-downable. Tough to get into"
4,A Story of Difference,A very poignant look at life from a small person's perspective. Heartwrenching account of her life growing up in wartime Germany. Makes you truly think about what life would be like to be considered different than anyone else
5,An indepth perspective of humanities' qualities,I found this story to delve into the basic person. Describing a variety of life styles and beliefs that gave the reader a bay window view of life and how the past affects our present and future actions
3,I found this book had a very slow start.,"I found this book to have a very slow start and wasn't too interesting or exciting. I had a hard time staying interested. It was a good book at times, and I did keep reading, so I guess it wasn't too bad. I would rate this book average"
4,"Really good, but not my kind of book.","I read this book just recently. I liked the book overall. It was a really neat story and shows a differnet perspective on WWII. On the other hand, I enjoy books to do something, have action.This book is definately not an adventure book, which I didn't expect. I have emense reaspect for Mrs. Hegi, she wrote a great book, but it just wasn't the type I enjoy really well."
4,Intriguing,"This was one of the most haunting and satisfying stories I have read in a long time. Normally, I speed through novels, but this one I took a long time to read so I could savour the story. I found it so interesting, humourous and haunting all at the same time. It was recommended to me by a friend who said, ""It's a little slow-going at first, but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded."" I can't put it any better than that."
3,A very ambitious writing project but a disappointing ending!,"It's hard to criticise a book that was so thorough and detailed. Ursula Hegi must love to write! I loved her characters, her meticulous details. It's easy to love the main character Trudi. The story read like a biography. It just seemed like Hegi had a hard time figuring out how she was going to end the book. It seemed as if there were a lot of ""loose ends"". There were issues that didn't seem to have a conclusion. I know real life is like that but for a fiction book I wish she would have ended it with a bit more pizazz. If she re-wrote the ending it would be a perfect book!"
5,Small woman; epic story,"Trudi Montag is a character that will stay with me for a while. Through her ""zwerg"" eyes, Hegi has created a rich tapestry that displays the beauty and horrors of Germany during both World Wars. Without a doubt the best Holocaust fiction I have read."
5,Slow starting but hang in there and it gets awesome!,I agree with a lot of the reviews I read on here. It does start very slowly and it isn't an easy read but after a couple of chapters I was hooked. I thought it was very moving and highly recommend.
3,Stones From The River,"This book began, for me, as a typical required summer reading book: slow and boring. At first, I admit, I was not intrigued and seriously wondered if I would have the will to finish this by September. I did not really connect with Trudi Montag, a dwarf living in Nazi Germany, on any level. However, after the slow start, I began to realize the real plot of the novel: it was not just Trudi's life story being told, but it the magnitude of change that the Nazi Regime brought about was being portrayed through her eyes. I could feel myself in her world as it did a complete 360. This story becomes progressively more realistic, deatiled, shocking, and completely compelling. This book gave me a whole new understanding of this dark time in history."
4,Stones From The River,Stones From The River is an interesting and thought-provoking novel. This story tells of a small German town during World War Two and chronicles the various hardships the town goes through when the town's citizens are torn apart based on their views of both Jews and the newly formed Natzi party. Told from the perspective of a dwarf girl living in the town this novel portrays a viewpoint rarely experienced by American readers (that of a non-Jewish as well as anti-Natzi). Through this story readers learn about the hardships German citizens experienced after World Wars One and Two and how keeping silent only slowed the healing process for this town and its people. Although the book is a bit to long and takes a while to get interesting it is a wonderful story that is both entertaining and educational.
3,Like the Enegizer Bunny,"I read The Vision of Emma Blau before I read this. That book had made me want to know more about Trudi Montag, who was mentioned briefly in Vision, and this little German town and its characters. I now fear I know too much! The author creates, then discards characters like they are used tissues. She talks about this person's mother-in-law, then that one's niece; if you put the book down for a few days, then pick it up again, all of these third string characters sort of blend together. No one stands out except for Trudi - perhaps that was the author's goal. A geneological chart at the end would have been helpful."
3,"Entertaining, Touching","This book is no literary masterpiece, but it is a touching and enjoyable read. The zwerg (dwarf) progagonist is the center of the story, which spans both world wars and the aftermath of both in small-town Germany."
3,Could've been worse,"This book has it's moments, but on the whole it is slow, predictable, and boring. Hegi spends too much time on things of little consequence, and the last five pages are so overwritten and self-indulgent I finished the novel feeling nauseated.The story tends to wander, and it's obvious Hegi wasn't exactly sure what she wanted to do with it. Threads start, then fade without resolution. Whatever strong characters or plot-lines are here get bogged down in masses of hollow banter.There are better things to read."
4,"Ambitious and Original, fails in the end","A fascinating book which weaves a full tapestry of a small German town infected by all of the cancers rampant in between the war Germany. Trudi is a perfect one to tell the story. Different but also consumed by a deep bitterness and wish for revenge. While others have summarized the book well and it has no faults as a consuming read it, dissapointingly, falls apart at the end. From almost out of the blue the last long monologue is devoted to Trudi's childhood relationship with Georg -- a childhood friend who ultimately rejected her under pressure from peers. Her inability to understand and sympathize with Georg is revealed in the end as her own salvation. Georg is some kind of metaphor for all of Germany. It may be there, but I did not find it. The reader should have been more prepared for this surprise ending"
4,"Good, but not excellent","I really liked this story. I learned about the people of WWII and their struggles. The main struggle, Trudi's handicap, was described in a way that helped me begin to see what it might be like to be a Zwerg. The descriptions of the townspeople and their various relationships kept my interest. All these strengths, to me, make a good book.However....the ending was missing something. It almost seemed like a different person wrote the last 20 pages. It left me asking a few questions, like who was the mid wife's baby? What REALLY happened to Max? Why didn't she ever reveal what happened with the boys? I guess that might be the author's way of ending it ""cliffhanger"" style."
4,"I am 5'9"" and I am a Zwerg...","...My first instinct when I read a very popular book is want tohate it out of protest-out of a need to be different. As I beganreading about Trudi Montag, I began to see the humor in my conflicting desires to be different and to belong. (You have to laugh or you will cry.) I am 5'9"" yet I know I am a ""Zwerg."" Ursula Hegi, in telling the story of a dwarf woman, emphasizes the smilarities and highlights the value of the differences in us all. In so doing, not only was I forced to look at myself and reevaluate my own motivations, but was also forced to view the actions of others through the lenses of those motivations. What would I do in the face of the same political climate that engulfed a nation and swallowed individuals? Now that I know Trudi, maybe I would have the courage to fight the Nazis and not look away."
4,observations of german life before the war,"I have been reading books about germany both before and after my trip there in may 1997. After the Ipswich Files which also took place before the war and was an observation of german life , from an englishman's point of view, I have been having comparing thoughts. I visited Dachau when in germany, and still find it so hard to believe that the regular people allowed their friends and neighbors to be taken without outbursts. I also wondered how the dwarf lady survived with hitler eliminating all those who are not perfect"
5,Excellent Read,Was talking with an elderly European friend about Hitler's rise to power. Our discussion led to my query about how everyday Germans responded to his 'leadership'. My friend recommended this book. Hegi provides a believeable account of life in Germany during the rise of Hitler. Her characters are knowable and thoroughly human. I finished the book having a better understanding of how this terrible time in history occurred.
4,thought provoking,"I have read many books that make you think, others that make you wonder what was in your mind when you picked it up in the first place, but I am pleased to say this book is in the former catagory. I learnt to see things from the German perspective and what it must have been like to see and hear the total dedication of the Nazi phenomenon taking place.It makes you give thanks for not being in that situation, let alone having to live with the phyiscal differences that she did. I admire her spirit to keep going, for struggling with her circumstances and being an example to us all on the inner strength that is within us all, but sometimes seems too deep to reach."
4,Remarkable,This is a novel of unique depth and richness. The style is so understated that one could miss what is going on but that is an important part of the strength of this compelling book. This is not a novel for those who want instant gratification. Some reviewers have mentioned the somewhat tedious opening chapters. The plot does develop slowly but it is well worth the wait. The story of the life of Trudi Sontag from childhood thru her young adult years in Germany during and after World War II is a testament to the best and worst in human beings. Trudi is unlike everyone else but thru her tale we learn that she is very much like all of us and her heroism is an inspiration because of it.
5,A Glimpse Into a Harrowing Time,"Trudi Montag, the pint-sized heroine of Hegi's marvelous ""Stones From The River"" provides us with a glimpse into the cultural, racial, social phobias of the Nazi era. More than that, however,Hegi gives us a glimpse into the sometimes delicate, sometimes volatile, always valuable mind of a being born to be set apart because of her size and appearance. This is a thoughtful, thorough, and careful book, but excellently written and thought-provoking in a myriad of ways. A fine piece of literature. Full of worthwhile lessons about the human experience."
2,"One thumb up, the other down","I'm torn about this book, I enjoyed her writing style and parts of the story. It is a little depressing since the setting was in Germany during the World Wars. There were way too many characters, 38 to be exact, so I had a hard time keeping many of them straight. It was long and boring in places. What I really disliked was the ending, in short- ""I don't get it?"""
3,stones from the river,"I read this book on Oprah's recommendation. It was hard to get started but once I started reading it the body of the story was great. I was, however, VERY dissappointed at the ending. It totally ruined what could've been a great novel."
3,hmmmm...,"When I purchased this book, the clerk said to me, ""oh, you are going to love it... it is going to be a classic"". It took me so long to actually get involved into the characters, and even afterwards I would find myself loosing track and spacing during the middle of a page. We have all heard numerous stories of the horrors of WWII; I wish that Hegi had concentrated a little more on Trudi and her character development."
2,Slow start -- good middle -- lousy ending,"This book was a major disappointment. The author seems todrone on and on about ordinary happenings without providing any pointor revelance to the overall story line. I plodded through the last 100 or so pages hoping for an ending that would tie everything together or at least be a happy one for Trudi. Instead, the book just sort of petered out. I was very disappointed and felt like reading this book was a huge waste of my time. I guess I just didn't get it."
2,disappointed,"I really don't understand the high rating for this book. I found it a hard read and just when I would get interested in part of the story it was on to something else. I made myself finish it, hoping the ending would be better than the first 1/2. It wasn't."
2,plodding life story,"Initially Stones from the River was promising, however, as the book proceeded it became a tedious series of events in the life of Trudi. After a while it became difficult to even empathize with her as she seemed more and more unmoved by the events around her. Also, the prose style seemed forced and even cliche."
1,The most retarded book I've ever read!,This book is depressing with morally corrupt values. I can't believe that my english teacher made us read it! Who cares if poor Trudi Montague is short? I think she should stop whining about it and no one should be required to hear her gripe about it! This is a pity party that I really don't want to attend!
3,STONES FROM THE RIVER,I LISTENED TO STONES FROM THE RIVER ON AUDIO CASSETTE I ENJOYED THE TAPES THEIR WAS ONE PART I DISLIKED WHEN THIS MOTHER GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL THAT WAS A DWARF HER MOTHER ABANDONED THE GIRL AND THE GIRL WAS RAISED BY MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. GERTRUDE WAS IN AN ASYLUM HIDING HER SHAME FOR GIVING BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL THAT WAS THE ONLY PARTS I DISLIKED IN THE BOOK OTHERWISE THE TAPE RECORDED VERSION WAS EXCELLENT. SUPPOSE YOUR MOTHER ABONDANED YOU AS A CHILD FOR BEING DIFFERENT THIS TEACHES PEOPLE WRONG PRINCIPALS AND VALUES SINCE GOD CREATED EVERYONE DIFFERENT IN THIS WORLD TO LIVE IN HAPPINESS AND PEACE IN OUR SOCIETIES.
2,it was ok,"My school made me read this for a required summer reading and i have to say this book was not that good. Yes it does show potential and wasn't completely a waste of my time, but it was quite dry and if i had to choose i wouldn't read it again. to reiterate it was ok, nothing spectacular and personally i wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 30."
4,Don't put this book down. You'll be glad you didn't!,"Trudi Montag, a woman born in Burgdorf, Germany tells her country's story through the end of World War II by telling her own. As the book begins, Trudi's parents attempt to raise a dwarf daughter in a town of ""tall"" people and Trudi struggles with her differentness and the acceptance of herself as she is despite the cruelty of others' reactions to her. Unfortunately, Hegi spends 150 pages tracing the first seven or so years of this adjustment and it becomes quite boring. As I passed that point, however, Hegi began to introduce the townspeople in a very intimate way, World War II ensued and I found myself intrigued with this story, unable to put it down for days. The comination of recorded history, the use of extensive characterization and the saga of Trudi Montag make Hegi's book an irresistable piece of literature. I would specifically recommend it for those like myself who read too little history and could use a lesson or two."
4,Silent No Longer,"When I described The Tin Drum to a friend she said I should read Stones from the River. I expected it to pale by comparison with Gunther Grass' wonderful novel about a dwarf. But Hegi has created another epic, this one from a woman's perspective. Through Trudi's eyes, we understand that beliefs are less important than knowledge, silence is complicity when evil is abroad, differences in our lives are necessary and beautiful, how the politics of a time can warp and nearly destroy a whole generation, but especially that acknowledgement and forgiveness are prerequisites to healing. Hege's detailed descriptions of clothes, food, and personalities together with the endless tales and gossips of a small town make this a spellbinder. The anonymous benefactor keeps hope and goodness alive throughout. As a reader who loves to enter other times in history through fictional characters, I was both saddened and thoroughly satisfied with my visit to Burgdorf on the Rhein in WWII Germany."
3,"Wonderful story and characters, but rambling","Wonderful story; wonderful characters. The author makes one think hard about the complicity of silence. Thought it rambled, and could have been 50 - 100 pages shorter."
3,not a lasting impression,"I found this book very hard to get into, however, there were some very intriguing parts. I had to read this for school, and there were a few girls who absolutely loved it. Now that we have discussed it, if I were to read it again, I think that I would find it more captivating, but for now, I give it 3 stars."
2,Gave it an Honest 125 page try!,"At times, I found this book interesting, but it would frequently drag me off to irrelevant unknown places, too many characters that I was uninterested and lost! I tried, but after 125 pages, I couldn't imagine going to the 500 or so!"
5,Inspires Thought,I found this book insightful on many avenues. Opens up a different perspective of the country and its people during this most written about episode in history. The characters are well developed and easily identified with. A difficult book to put down once you get involved in the plot.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge
4,On the banks of the Rhine,"Trudi, our protagonist, is a keen observer of the inhabitants of the town she lives in. As she watches and listens, stories flow by and are woven into the tapestry of life in a German town during the first and second world wars: birth, death, tenderness, brutality, love, betrayl and loss. I found myself marveling at the beauty of the writing in this book. The story was engrossing and rich and the characters in all their quirks and foibles were fascinating. Maybe it was just me, but the ending seemed to be a bit slowly paced, but that is my only complaint with this wonderful book."
4,"One Person's, One Town's Snapshot of History","Hegi foremost brings a piece of the sorrowful yet fascinating period of German history to light through the eyes of a character (and the town she lives in) swept along the tides of history. This book was unique in its portrayal of the everyday lives of people in lieu of and because of the tragic events going on around them. With her very poetic telling of these details, Hegi made this a very pleasant read. Yes, there are some slow spots, but on the whole this book flowed well enough to keep me interested and turning the pages."
1,Toughest book I never finished.,"This was the most tedious book I havd ever started to read. Oprah said to give it time, but no matter how far I got into it, it didn't get better. Maybe you have to read it in Europe to enjoy it. Dark, doom and misery. Yuck!"
1,How I Wasted My Summer Vacation,"Why do so many people like this dark, depressing book? I just didn't get it. I hope that no one's life is this ""realistic"". Couldn't anything work out for this character? Just one aspect of her pathetic little life? Trudy needs therapy. I didn't expect this book to end in a rainbow, but I at least expected a little hope. Trudy has no hope. Hopelessly depressing."
4,Compelling as a character study.,"This book had my undivided attention from the beginning, to almost the end, when I seemed to have had enough of it and was anxious to finish. I loved the way the author went inside of Trudi's mind and shared her thoughts and made her human with both positive and negative attributes. What it shared about WWII, however, gave no further insight and pretty much has all been said before. The power point was when Trudi walked through the rain to the river and consciously chose not to inherit her mother's insanity. I also liked the way the book summed up the idea that we are the sum-total of not only our experiences, but also the memories of these experiences."
4,Self Rationing at the end to avoid the inevitable!,"Once I had my feet on the ground and was certain the story would improve I could hardly stop reading. Hegi's characters possess depth parallel to the towns people of many German towns during this horrific time and through Trudi, the reader is able to share both the many pains and unexpected pleasures of a soul far greater then the dwarf body portrays.I rationed single pages at the end to delay saying goodbye.Fortunately, I picked up Michael Chabon's ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"". Same time frame including Prague and the U.S. as two cousins enter the world of Super Hero Comics and New York City prior to the Bombing of Pearl Harbor. And alsmost as good as ""Stones from the River"".Definitely recommended."
4,Silent No Longer,"When I described The Tin Drum to a friend she said I should read Stones from the River. I expected it to pale by comparison with Gunther Grass' wonderful novel about a dwarf. But Hegi has created another epic, this one from a woman's perspective. Through Trudi's eyes, we understand that beliefs are less important than knowledge, silence is complicity when cruelty is abroad, differences in our lives are necessary and beautiful, how the politics of a time can warp and nearly destroy a whole generation, but especially that acknowledgement and forgiveness are prerequisites to healing. Hege's detailed descriptions of clothes, food, and personalities together with the endless tales and gossips of a small town make this a spellbinder. The anonymous benefactor keeps hope and goodness alive throughout. As a reader who loves to enter other times in history through fictional characters, I was both saddened and thoroughly satisfied with my visit to Burgdorf on the Rhein in WWII Germany."
5,You have to read this!,I couldn't put this one down. Tudi's story isn't necessarily depressing just very real and touching. WWII Germany is brought to life with color and feeling through the eyes of this dwarf woman. I felt like I was living it. A great story about being different and self acceptance in a dangerous world. I didn't want this story to end.
2,Stuck on page 300,"I started the book knowing that I had to get past the first 100 pages and I did. But, for the last few days, I've been stuck around page 300. The story has great potential, but there's too many ""little"" details to keep in your head. I love the character of Trudi and how she interprets what is happening. Her point of view is a very powerful one, but I think it gets lost when it's intertwined with so many other characters!"
2,Looses your interest after a while.,"I was at first reluctant to read this book since it was an Oprah book club selection, but I read it anyway since it was so highly recommended from friends. The story is a very touching one about a ""vertically challenged"" woman who struggles to live with her difference in a ""tall"" society. The story is interesting but then halfway through the book it turns into a war novel depicting stories of what it was like to live in Germany as a Jew in World War II. I think that Hegi should've stuck to one story line. The novel seemed to be divided into two different strories that went on for too long. It was hard to finish it."
2,Book didn't make sense,"I read this book expecting an epic tale about saving people during WWII. I expected too much. Trudi Montag, the main character who tries to accept herself through others, didn't hold my attention and gave me a cold feeling throughout the book. She antagonites over somewhat petty things, but seems to not let them go, resulting in a slow, awkward book. Although Helgi tries to show the German population and how they were affected, I found the town and it's people to be overbearing at times. This book is a long one, and unless you like the author, I don't think it is worth reading !Melody"
5,An amazing woman,"The main caracter of this book is an amazing woman. She looks into the hearts of the people in her small town and sees who they really are, at a time when people are hiding their true feelings, even from themselves. She is courageous, and she fights he Nazi's in every smll way that she can"
4,well told story of difficult time in history,"Intriguing seemed to be most repeated word during our book group discussion regarding Stones in the River. The creation of the character of Trudi was well done, and we wondered how the author knew so much of dwarfism. The description of small town life in Germany during the holocaust was very descriptive and we were able to empathize, as we live in a small town ourselves."
3,Tedious though thought provoking,"Although the book gives insight to the mentality of silence that led to the extermination even of their own neighbors, the reading became laborious in many sections. Especially jarring was the precocious presentation of the toddler Trudi. Thought processes and exchanges between the 3-4 year olds were so abberant that it was difficult to shake the distraction."
2,Lonestar quilt,There simply was not enough information to do what I wanted from this book. There needed to be more in depth information. It was brief and I wanted enough to make this quilt and I could not from reading this book.
5,Jan Krentz- Quilter extraordinary,"In her first book, Jan (past National Quilt Teacher of the Year) demonstrates her expertise and eye for the beautiful.I was fortunate enough to personally see some of the work that went into this book.Her choice of this popular and historic pattern was excellent. The Lone Star has a heritage that intertwines with both the settler and Native American traditions.Jan's method of making this pattern helps you make one more quickly and accurately than some of the traditional methods.Her variations on the theme are also of great interest.She utilizes a number of the best piecers and quilters in her illustrations, showcasing their fine work. The colors and fabric choices, heavy embellishments, and intense quilting in some of the work is astonishing.All in all, a ""keeper"" for the serious quilter."
3,watch the errors!,"those of us who have been making lone star quilts for a while will instantly know that the cutting chart in the back of the book is incorrect.....all of it! diamonds are measured one way, the strips to cut them, another. check the authors' website for corrections, but be advised, the chart is still wrong. Adding a half an inch to the size of a diamond does not give you the size of strip to cut. Her projects are probably OK though."
5,truly worth the money,"This book is one that I would recommend to the intermediate to advanced quilter without reservation. The directions are very clear, the photos are fabulous and the options are endless using her suggestions for splitting diamonds and mix and matching the borders. This is a pattern book and reference book that you will return to again and again for inspiration. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT."
2,"Looking dowdy, I'm sorry to say","I don't want to knock Sarajane Helm for creating a useful book for its time. I remember liking it when I first got it ... but with over 20 polymer clay craft books on my bookshelf a few months ago, it was time to cull and this was the first to go. The projects and samples are limited in style and extremely outdated. The photography is poor and the layout uninspired. Though published in 2001, it looks like it is out of the late 80's or early 90's.There are now SO MANY wonderful polymer clay books on the market that provide better information and inspiration, not to mention step by step instructions illustrated with wonderful photos and diagrams. Look out for the more recent publications, particularly if you aspire to creating work considered contemporary."
5,Fantasy meets Reality,Hoffman's imagination and grasp of the world is simply amazing. He truly knows how to warp any moment into the fantastic and he certainly does it extremely well. Like his music his stories are meant to captivate.
4,Most accurate information I have read,"I have enjoyed other books by this author more, for instance, her book on Karma and Reincarnation. However, the book was easy reading for me and included illustrations which helped the reader visualize their connection with their Higher Self. Instead of just philosophical information, this book gives the reader the tools to access the Higher Self with decrees. A worthwhile read for those wanting a better understanding of the Higher Self and, the ability to merge with the Higher Self."
1,Everything but Flamenco!,If you are looking for flamenco... hop on!Flamenco is from the heart. Alabina is made to sell. It does include a lot exotic influences and sounds rather nice.
5,Youth sentiment,"When I was a child we had this album at home and we also had it on tape so we could listen to it in the car. Back then, I did'nt understand the lyrics but was fascinated by the voice of Christopher Lee, the running Troll, the scary Witch and thundering King. Since long, the album and tape have vanished and it is great to have it back, on CD. The music is as wonderful as ever and even now I do understand the lyrics, it has'nt lost any of the magic it had for me when I was little."
5,Another fantastic Cam Jansen Adventure!,"You have to love Cam Jansen. When you're a kid, you read all of these stories about magic powers, mystery, and adventure. But everyone tells you magic can't exist. Cam Jansen manages to solve every case without the use of magic... she's a real girl. That's what makes her special and what makes you want to read more and more. She lives her life and has friends just like everyone else. Cam Jansen is a real kid superhero, and the thought that a person like her could actually exist... makes her the best kid detective ever! Kids can really associate themselves with Cam and her friends. Our family loves Cam Jansen!"
3,"Ah, it's OK","This book is indeed a little difficult to understand. Unless you know C and or C++, it is hard to understand. There are indeed errors in the book. Is this some sort of trickery in order to be able to continue to come out with a 2nd, a 3rd, a 4th, etc. editions?"
1,"DON""T BUY THIS BOOK","Wow this book sucks... unorganized and incomplete. The most common line was ""you will learn more about that later on day xxxx""STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK"
1,21 days? what a joke,The title is misleading: I was looking for a quick way to learn Java and was very disappointed. The book is filled with irrelevancies. Stay away from it if you're in a hurry. Hint: look at the number of pages...
3,"Assembly line ""Teach Yourself"" book doesn't teach clearly.","I tried learning Java from this book and failed. Perhaps I shouldn't blame the book but rather my lack of previous experience with object-oriented programming. In any case, this book did not cover object-oriented design sufficiently or clearly enough for it to click. If you already have this background, perhaps this book would be of more use, but if you are trying to learn Java and have never taken C++, Pascal, or any other object-oriented language, I would look for another book."
2,Teach Yourself JAVA in 21 Days If You Already Know It,"This was a very tough book to use. I know some of the older programming languages, but nothing similar to JAVA. I tried to learn it from this book, but was totally unsuccessful. I just could not follow the author's stream of logic. Eventually, I gave up."
3,not good for me,"I am a beginner,I want to learn java quickly.but this book cann'thelp me to do this."
2,"Poorly organized, poorly conceived, full of ERRORS!","Open your eyes! Look past the hype, the advertising and the non-stop promotion schemes. Lemay has managed to turn a mediocre style and extremely thin technical knowlege into a career writing poor quality books that are consistently full of errors. I found more errors in this single book than I've ever found in any other book. When errors are in the code as well as the author's discussion, mere mortals like you and I have little chance of actually learning Java. As far as learning Java in 21 days, it simply cannot be done if you use this book. Beyond errors and other problems, the book fails to cover many key issues. The entire toolkit for graphical interfaces is glossed over and examined so briefly that you can't possibly learn how to create applets that really do something. Definitely look elsewhere for your Java needs"
2,Poorly organized. Pooly executed.,Often I found myself wondering if the authors really understoodwhat they were droning on and on about.
2,Not that Great,"You have to know ALOT about programming to understand aword of this book. Reading it gives you a headache andmakes you dizzy unless you've programmed with SEVERAL DIFFERENT computer languages before. It does, however, come with some cool software and great .class files to use, but it still isn't my idea of the ideal book."
3,Average and simple,"I've just finished reading this sucker in far less than 21 days. The author didn't organize the structure well enough to maximize each day, but who's gonna read just one chapter a day anyway (Chapter 13 was thrice the length and difficulty of almost all other chapters)? Basically, if you have a good foundation in programming, especially OOP, then you'll have no trouble with this book. The authors do fairly well in explaining the concepts of basic java programming, but trudge along slowly in some sections, while moving too quickly through others. I must admit, however, this book is a good introductory text into Java, as long as you've got a solid foundation in OOP beforehand. If you're looking for anything beyond the basics, however, you won't find too much here (of course what can you expect from a 21 days book). As a desk reference it's fairly useful, if you don't have anything else designated specifically for that purpose already."
2,Hard to understand.,"There were too many errors in this book, and the book jumps from topic to topic while they weren't finished. I am a C++ programmer, and it's still hard to understand many concepts so vital in learning Java. Don't buy it, I'm sure you will refund it, or regret that you bought it, like I did."
3,Pretty good for beginners.,"This is a good idea. The concept is well developed but as in most real-life situations, the details make the difference. The code that appears through the book somtimes contains errors. Not that this prevents the reader from a fully understanding, but it can confuse unexperienced programmers. Altough I had little problems with those details, I think they should be taken out in order to make this book a better experience."
4,Overall - Pretty Good,The book supposedly is geared for beginners to the Java world - and for that it works. The sections where Lemay does not write are clearly evident. Lemay takes definitions and breaks it up into digestable bites. The other contributors rattle on until my head wants to explode! Take it for what it is worth - a basic book.
2,O.K. book the programmer s that can stop lots of errors!!,"I was so frustred by reading this book that I ended up giving it away and buying a book that I could actually understand. Almost all of the examples were chalk full of errors. I could never get them to work. I felt like such an idiot, thinking that it was my fault that they weren't working. I highly recommend a different book for the beginner. Don't be fooled by the well known name of ""samsnet"""
1,Look up all the errors on the internet before buying.,"I found this book to be a waste of money. Not only does Sun have a newer edition of Java available on the Internet but there were so many errors in the code that it was unusable and frustrating.If you like doing the editor's and author's work by correcting their errors, you'll love it."
5,A great read even during a hurricane!,"Ms. St. Claire has become an automatic buy for me, and THE FIRE STILL BURNS is further proof that she knows how to write for the ""keeper shelf.""In her second Desire, we meet the second McGrath brother, the perfect hero for the uptight, old money Grace Harrington. Unconventional Colin McGrath has loved Gracie since college--and he's exactly what she needs to break out of her father's too restrictive lifestyle.There are enough surprises along the way to keep the pages turning even when forced to read by flashlight (courtesy of hurricane Jeanne). Don't let this great read disappear from the shelf--you'll want to be ready for Cameron McGrath when her third book in the series comes out in April of 2005."
5,Happy Shopper,"I recently purchased a couple of items from Amazon, a Casio NP-40 battery and Casio BC-30L charger for my EX-Z750 digital camera. I am happy with the products and impressed with the quick delivery and packaging. You can be sure I will be ordering more items from Amazone with confidence."
3,Battery charger for Casio camera,"I have a difficult time getting it to charge. If I place the battery in and out three of four times, it finally will charge."
3,"Hmm, a bit pricey","It may be stating the obvious, but why does this charger cost $43.99? It's a small piece of plastic with a few metal doo-hickeys. I am fairly sure the one that came with my camera is hiding somewhere in my house, but now I am stuck paying this much to replace it? Waaaaah."
3,Good review book,"Many of the bad marks for this book come from people using it to learn digital communications for the first time. However, I think its pretty good as a review text: it clearly and concisely covers the important concepts. It also manages to give a better feel of the theory from an application point of view, though their treatment of magnetic recording does not accurately describe important implementation details.My only knock on the book is that it would be well served by having more examples.Still, a better book as an overview is ""Digital Communications"" by Bernard Sklar."
2,"not a ""first course"" book.","The back cover says this book ""is primarily intended for use as a text for a first course in communications, or as a comprehensive reference for practicing engineers"". I think it accomplished half of that. If you already know the material its a pretty good as a reference. For a first course in communications, its not a good text book. The examples and proofs were poor. There just seemed to be a lot of holes in the material. Even the Prof. teaching the course suggested we look to other text books because of problems with this one."
2,Poor coverage of analog material,"I used this book for a ""refresher"" course prior to grad school. I considered some of the chapters to be breif in coverage, and as stated by others, lacking in examples. I have no comment on the later chapters on digital communication."
3,okay,it is a good and easy book. beginners can give it a try. the condition of the book was fair. i'll suggest you all to get the latest edition though.
4,"First, always look in the mirror","I have used this book in my Communications Systems class at Northeastern, though Proakis was not the teacher. I see all the bad ratings everyone gives this book and I wonder why? Maybe they do not have the necessary background to fully understand digital communication? Just maybe...I liked this book. I used it along with the Matlab book and enjoyed the course. I would have given it a 5* if it had more examples."
1,How not to write a textbook,"I think that this textbook is among the poorest I have ever had the displeasure of using. My peers agree, this is a great reference book for a professor of communications systems. If you have to use this book for your class, you might as well give up now."
2,Not very readable,"I usually understand concepts more from the book than from the class and a readable book is what prepares me for the exam. I regret to say that this book is not very readable for beginners. The book covers a lot of stuffs but not in great detail. Further the end of chapter problems CAN NOT be solved by reading the examples alone. So unless you have an excellent teacher teaching this class, or you have the basics for this course, stay away from this book."
1,Authors assume to much.,"This book should be for graduate level courses. There are no answers provided for any of the end of chapter problems. In addition the problems contain mostly proofs that are poorly written and assumes the reader/student can put the missing pieces together. Also, the material in the chapters is incomplete for the problems and there are a limited number of examples throughout."
1,"Misleading ""STOP"" Make sure and read the fine print.",Make sure and take the time to read the fine print. This is not a hardcover book. This is a series of solutions taken from a solutions manual and emailed chapter by chapter. Taking advantage of those like me that have always had good experiences with Amazon up until this point. I will pay a lot more attention to detail when shopping at Amazon from sellers of used material.
4,Are you unnecessary?,"My father taught me if you agree with everything an author (or anyone else says) one of you is unnecessary, and it's not the author. This training system works. I don't agree with the partial reps approach - FOR ME. But applying their formulae to my workouts and using full range movements, I have nearly doubled my functional strength in less than 8 weeks and in only 6 workouts. I have added 11 pounds of lean muscle mass (based on caliper testing). More importantly to me, I have nearly tripled my muscle endurance. And my workouts take a quarter of the time they used to, so I have more time to enjoy other areas of my life. This book is definitely worth reading."
4,Why does this have to cost so much,"I love Ochs, but $125 is too much. Why doesn't someone reissue this?"
5,honest seller,"The seller sold me a paperback instead of the advertised hardcover i ordered. Once he realized his error he absorbed all charges and told me to keep the paperback anyway. Now, that's an honest seller that i'd deal with again in a heartbeat. Bob W. Goshen, Ct."
4,"pretty good,not on my top 10 list though.",I didn't think this book was as good as Keene's other books. the mystery part wasn't even that good. it took so long for everything to happen.and what about nancy and frank???they appear even remotly interested in each other.
2,Dr Jim?,"It's a VHS tape burned on a dvd.I was more interested in seeing them use the methods and not just talking about them.Not a lot of fishing,a lot of talk about fishing and clips of fishing but not fishing.The part about cleaning the fish was the best."
4,Great But too highly price,The Video is Great to learn how to catch a flounder. Everything you want to know is inside like what to use to fish a flounder what rods to use and baits . Well I'll give it 4 stars because it is overprice $20.00 for a 45 min VSH video tape.
3,Really beautiful but way oo much fog filter!!,"This paperback claims to be just a collection of shots lifted from the movie in it's making. David Hamilton probably got his initiation by fire as far as making a movie went with Bilitis. This is a lovely book of extracts. Not having seen the movie I cannot comment on it but certainly as a stand alone piece this is a book of beautiful pictures. Nowadays it's likely to attract some negative attention because of the age of the models. slowly we'll destroy all innocence by dirtying it up in our efforts to protect it! However, there is a naive and beutiful innocence captured here that might be fast becoming a thing of the past as we become more and more Victorian and make more and more beauty and innocene into something dirty.Cheers"
3,wonderful writing,"I am not a big reader of mysteries but I really love Mary McMullen. Her books are out-of-print and difficult to find but it is her writing that really draws me. I would love to live inside the world she creates in her books. Charming characters, beautiful locations, fairly good plots. I guess I would say, in a word, that it is the atmosphere that most charms me."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I never write reviews, but this product is so HORRIBLE!!! I bought a big bottle because it was on sale at my salon- such a WASTE OF MONEY!! I've tried using it more than once and every time it leaves my HAIR STICKY, WAXY, MATTED! Takes twice as long to straighten hair because you can barely run a straightener through it. DO NOT BUY."
5,best conditioner ever....,"This is the best conditioner I have ever tried, and I have tried so many to make my thin hair look shiny and fuller. I use it every day and the day I use something else, I can tell the difference how my hair holds all day....and I am a brunette, it adds a beautiful shine to my hair."
1,DOES NOT GIVE PROPER DIRECTIONS,"Do not buy this unit. While it has many bells and whistles, it does not do what it was designed to do - give correct directions. The routes it gives are not the shortest - no matter what you do. It directs you on local roads instead of highways! I have contacted the manufacturer about this problem and they have actually admitted there is one, but they have not been able to fix it. It has been over a month. Buy a Garmin or Tom Tom. They will cost you more money, but they will actually get you to your destination in a timely manner."
5,just beautiful,I love this print it is just as it appears here. The colors are natural and match with almost any decor. I have this in my kitchen.
3,I've got to agree with Searle...,"If you are an eliminative materialist then you need help! Not that there aren't some interesting observations in this book - see the chapter with new data on ""filling in"" - but Churchland's tired example of Maxwell's discovery of electromagnetic waves only demonstrates how subjective the entire world of science really is. A more interesting example might be Maxwell's equations and how they relate to entropy, but I suspect that Churchland's actual knowledge of physics is more on the level of Betty Crocker's knowledge of microwaves...As for neural nets: go read Perlovsky! I find it odd that Churchland, who loudly proclaims nets as the future of AI, doesn't appear to have read any of Perlovsky's papers; but I suspect he's too busy waving magnets in his living room generating EM waves."
5,Man and Islam,"A must read for everyone especially our youthMan And Islam. Amazing, easy to understand,wants to read again and again love it, highly recommend it.Need of this century."
5,Terrific collection...no problems with disc!,"This is an amazing collection of hard-to-find Astronauts songs. And like everything from the Bear Family label, you really get alot of value -- so many songs, and all remastered to peak perfection. Andru Reeve approves!"
4,Power Through Simplicity,"These beautiful, sturdy, coated, hand-drawn and hand-lettered cards can go with you wherever you are, slipping into your pocket or resting on your desk or altar. The hand-drawn angels offer lovely single words to contemplate, applying them to a particular issue or to your day or life as a whole. My friends, clients, and colleagues love to use these small but powerful symbols as inspiration throughout each day.......... ""Freedom"" .................. ""Balance"" ................... ""Humor"" ............ some of my recent cards ..May you find your deepest wisdom in these delightful cards and in each moment of life!"
4,Good for Daily Inspiration but Lacks Deep Definitions and Clarity!,"These are great cards to choose when you wake up for the day or have a simple question that needs a straightforward answer to. However, if you are looking for something to give you a deep answer or clarity, these aren't the cards that will do that for you.I keep a set on my desk at my office. Sometimes I will sit there and toil with a new business idea or think about a vendor that I'm having difficulty with then choose a card and many times it will give me some clarity in the situation. Sometimes it won't. One-word answers sometimes don't cut it. It depends on what's going on in your life.However, I do recommend this small deck so long as you're not looking for something to give you deep, super clear answers to life and death questions."
4,Inspirational Fun,Makes a great gift or for personal use. Compact and easy to use. Great fun at gatherings or to set the tone for your day. Very generic and can be used by anyone.
1,"Did not recieve I got two ""Original"" by mistake. shipping problems",My order was for one Original and one Expanded Edition. I only got two Original....I would like to get my correct order....I have known these cards for a long time and love them.
4,Good to have,After owning the German cards for years it is nice to have a book. But I rated it only with four stars because it could have just a bit more information.
5,great price,"love the prices and the selection you carry, will continue to purchase as long as the availability and prices are good"
3,Meh!,"My 3 year old loves anything Thomas. Toys, movies, whatever has Thomas. So if you have an obsessed kiddo - they will most likely love it too! I don't particulary care for Pierce Brosnan's narrating. My first son grew up with Ringo & Carlin - maybe I'm just biased!"
5,A mom,I rented this movie and my son has not stopped singing the songs yet!! I am going to have to buy it now. We love it!!
5,My Grandson Likes It,I have not yet watched this DVD but my 2 1/2 year old grandson likes Thomas and I'm told he really enjoys this one. It keeps his attention and it's a great babysitter.
2,Never again,I bought this show and a couple others dvds. I find thomas and friends are always insulting each other and are crashing all the time. This is why my child will not watch these shows.
5,Effective,"I was a little skeptical about whether something like this could make a difference in my daily battles with PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety and phobia. But, the first time I listened to it I was deeply affected. Now I listen to the affirmations each night as I fall asleep and I'm looking forward to getting more of the CDs in this collection."
5,Top quality with an immediate effect,"I'm a therapist and a PTSD survivor. I just received the CD last night and heard it before bed and again this morning. I was not prepared for the profound and immediate effect this CD had on me, it is really the best I have ever heard. I feel calmer and less frantic today. I feel more willing to respect my pain so I can heal and release it. I know I can take care of myself and relax into my healing. I am deeply grateful for Belleruth's work and I feel hopeful that I will recover and thrive. Thank you!"
5,safe haven for healing,"This audio journey is delightful. I own several of her tapes and so was hopeful this would be new and different. My hopes were honored! At first listening, I was amazing, pleased, and impressed that the imagery was innovative, different from her other work, and even fun. Importantly, it provides a safe place for paced exploration. I was left wanting to go back again. I was also left with a sense of being reintroduced to myself - and remembering the strong and great ME that still exists, even after troubles. This is a hopeful audio tape that I have recommended to my clients. I work as a psychotherapist. Go ahead, treat yourself; you will move toward hope and healing."
1,Had trouble sleeping while listening to this....tried several nights...gave up!~,I bought several different ones ...no real way to know if they work....A Guided Meditation for Healing Trauma (PTSD) (Health Journeys)....could not see any real difference ....donated to the public library!~
1,"I did not think that this tape was ""powerful","On a subject like this you need a tape with alot of ""OOMPF""-so to speak. This cd seemed ""diluted"" and that it missed the mark in being any real help in healing this disorder. It seemed kind of ""namby-pamby"" . I would not have bought it if I could have listened to it first."
3,Passable,"I thought it was okay. I was slightly disappointed, maybe I expected too much after reading many positive reviews. It's nice to listen to but I don't really find it helping with my situation. Overall, it's fine and ""pass-able""."
5,"Peace, gentle peace","This little guided imagery has been helping me through anxious periods in my life for years. I have not personally suffered any particular ""trauma,"" but I think it would be helpful in spades for those who have."
4,A Nouveau artist of the late 20th century,"This is the only book that I've come across that presents the full spectrum of Albert Paley's work in crisp B/W and color photographs and that details a biography of the artist. My introduction to Paley came unexpectedly when at a function in the Wortham Center (Houston) I was greeted by his soaring Stairway Scuptures, which are included in this book. Paley goes beyond creating sculptures that stand as isolated works of art. His scuptures enhance the spaces in which they are placed and are themselves enhanced by those spaces. The author does a superb job of describing the experience of entering a vast architectural volume and the impact that Paley's monumental sculptures have by their positions within it. This book is the next best thing to having that experience for oneself. If you love Gaudi and other artists of the Art Nouveau movement, you will thoroughly enjoy this book."
2,Smaller than Expected,"This is a good inch shorter than the Heartland Valley 11-piece set it is suggested it can go with here on Amazon.Also, it's a cheap, plastic material, compared to the porcelain of the other set."
4,Swamp Dogg,This CD is loaded with nostalgic hits; those of you who enjoyed the 1970s and 1980s might find this CD most captivating.
3,Be Warned,"I bought this triple set because it said that Primal Fear was in widescreen version enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Well, that's not true. Although Primal Fear is in 1.85:1 widescreen; however, it is the same as the previously issued DVD, which is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs."
1,bw/wm mystery,This was an excellent mystery and fine love story. Very interesting and very worth the cost and time.
3,"GOOD METHOD, BAD PRODUCT!","el metodo me parecio muy bueno, pero el cd se traba, no lee siempre las tarjetas, aveces se reinicia solo, por lo que lo regrese una vez y pedi que me lo cambiaran por otro, y efectivamente me enviaron otro, pero ya paso el mes para poderlo devolver, y tengo los mismos problemas que con el primero, se traba, se reinicia, no lee siempre las tarjetas correctamente, etc. No vale la pena compralo por el precio y el mal funcionamiento, realmente yo crei que por lo que estaba pagando iba obtener un mucho mejor producto. NO LO RECOMIENDO."
1,I couldn't even get through it!,"I found this book on Amazon, and it looked decent enough. But when I went home and began to read it, I foundthat was really nothing more than lists, LKists of books that the supposed biographee had read, music he liked, words he said before the age of two, mostly a collection of gibberish. The book had no glue holding the entire thing together and I even disregarded the entire middle section, because after reading the first section, I didn't care anymore about EDwin's life, and just wanted to see how he died. Even that was dissapointing. THis book was not a fluent read, the author of the book inside the book was first of all writing way to advanced for his age level and didn't seem to care what happened. I found this book to be boring and long, without anything holding it together. I wouldn't recommend itMelody GiggleMel@aol.com"
5,Love this watch,"Always get compliments on this watch as it's both beautiful and has just the right amount of sparkle for me. It's also waterproof and very sturdy. I've never had any problems with it, except that it's always admired so I have to keep a close eye on it. ;)"
4,Keeps them busy.,We collect the Geotrax items for our 3 yr old twins. We thought this would be a nice addition since Dad works at a stone quarry. They enjoy rolling the ball down the spiral ramp. And a bonus is that it doesn't take batteries.
3,Not as great as it looks on the box,"We have a ton of GeoTrax toys and were so excited to get this one since my son loves anything construction. When we put it together I was a little disappointed. It doesn't have ""geomotion"" like I assumed it did (to make the conveyor belt move - guess I should have read the box better). Also, the top of the conveyor belt doesn't snap onto the top of the boulder chute, so the whole thing slides around. My son has to use one hand to hold it steady while he cranks it with the other hand. Additionally, the rubber tabs intended to hold the boulders on the belt as they move up seem to get stuck inside the plastic case when it's moving and the belt has popped off the track (I had to push it back on with a screwdriver and it seems to be better now that we've broken it in a bit). Overall, for the price, it's still fun. I would have paid more to get something a little more sturdy and with geomotion, though."
3,"Good idea, bad ""chain""","The Lift and load quarry is a really cute addition to our Geotrax and I was glad to find it pre-loved. However, the plastic ""chain"" on the crank that moves the boulders up the ramp constantly is coming out of the groove, making it really impossible to turn smoothly and will ultimately snap, given enough play. This snag has really gotten in my son's way of enjoying the toy. Although he does enjoy rolling the boulders about the windy delivery chute and onto the truck below. I can see why this one isn't still on the market, but may be getting reworked as we speak."
2,Flimsy,"We love Geo trax! However, since nothing holds the conveyer section to the main part, it slips around constantly, causing much frustration for a three year old. Pass on this and get one of the better sets."
4,probability for risk management,"This book is readable, easy to understand, and informative. It is recommended by the Society of Actuaries for the SOA/CAS Course 1 exam. I taught myself probability for the exam from this book."
5,Excellent!!,"I purchased this book (from a third party seller, Roy Mak) late last month to help prepare for the P1 exam. It arrived in less than four business days and was in excellent condition. It is very well-written and easy to read (quite an accomplishment for a book that deals with probability). Highly recommended!"
1,"annoying, biased, and poorly researched","This book does an immense disservice to the study of Henry Cowell's life. Because it reads well, one is fooled into thinking it's reliable, but there are gaping holes in the research, indeed there are many items in the book that are entirely conjecture."
3,The bone is the problem!,"I have a Belgian Tervuren and a Rottweiler/Belgian mix and both love frisbee's. I've tried the KONG frisbee(with much disappointment), West Paw and ORKA etc. This one one was third best. It's not soft enough when they play tug but it puts up with a LOT of chewing. The problem is we've been through three of these in two months and I've given up on them. Both dogs chew on the bones. The bone on top is thinner then the sides and is easily chewed through and once there are holes the entire frisbee can be easily destroyed. West Paw's frisbee put up with less gnawing but more tugging without damage. Kong the middle is easily ripped out. ORKA is the Best and the one I'll stick with it's been a daily used toy for three months with only canine indents to show for it. It's a decent frisbee for dogs with strong Jaws but for frisbee aficionados or those with dogs who like to chew don't get this frisbee."
3,Doesn't stand up to strong chewer,"This is a great toy in concept. The bone on top gives dogs a place to grab, so they aren't frustrated by a disc that they can't pick up. I had high hopes that a Nylabone product would stand up to our big terrier, but in less than 20 minutes she has chewed off the ends of the bone on top. She does love it, but I don't give it more than a few days at most before it's in pieces. For non-chewers, I think it would work great."
5,Best frisbee by far,"My German Shepard is ADDICTED! to this frisbee. It flies great, it's soft enough for his mouth, yet it's durable. Most importantly -he can pick it up. Can't wait for this to ship, the new ORKA flyer I just got will be going in the trash."
4,Dog Toys,"Great productGreat priceGreat deliveryTHE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE ASSORTED COLORS WERE GREEN, GREEN AND GREEN"
5,Book Review,This was a very good review of beginner sign lagnuage. I take this book with me everywhere I go and it's a quick reference with accurate hand movements w/ch is always helpful.
4,great resource,Good illustrations and a perfect resource for people who want to learn a little bit of sign language.
4,"Great ""Basic Training""","This book was chosen as the textbook for the ""Basic I"" sign language class in the signing ministry that recently started at our church. In the six weeks that we have been using it, along with having a gifted teacher, we have progressed to the point where our class was able to understand most of the signs that were used at a play we attended and we have been able to sign parts of the service at church with confidence.The pictures that go along with the signs are clear and the directions are easy to understand and follow. There are enough signs that you will be able to hold conversations in a very short time. The only thing missing are practice quizzes and fingerspelling exercises. This would be a big help in practicing the vocabulary.There is nothing that can replace a good teacher, but this book is a great way to learn the basics. If you happen to have the great teacher also, it is an unbeatable combination."
5,"""Signing: How To Speak With Your Hands"" by Elaine Costello, PHD","I began taking classes to learn A.S.L. about two years ago, and ""How To Speak With Your Hands"" was my first study guide. I found it to be an excellent book for a beginner and I continue to use it as a reference tool."
5,Signing by book,This book is really helpful in learning signs. It is a great tool to have when you are at places where you don't have access to learn by DVD/TV. It has a great index for quick searches. Elaine Costello mastered this piece of work. This book is also nice to have to practice with other people.
5,A beginning for Norwegian and English speaking children,"Our church, Gol Lutheran Church, of Norwegian extract of course, has this book in its library. I would like very much to have the book in my own library to help my grandchildren to speak some Norwegian. I am trying to relearn the little bit of Norwegian I learned in College and find the book helpful myself. Norwegian children learning to read would also find this book great fun in reading their own language! The book contains pictures of several items with the name of the item in both Norwegian and English. Items are placed in groups by page and contain sentences in both Norwegian and English"
1,Very Disappointing,"Having bought this book on the strength of the reviews on this page, I feel compelled to give another point of view. This book just proves that anyone can write and publish a book. It was insipid, self-absorbed and very simply written. At the same time I also bought Susie Kelly's ""A Perfect Circle"" which is a real gem. She is actually interested in the places she goes to and the people she meets."
3,Light read,"A frivolous little book. The information offered, with ostentatious French quotes, is not of any use to a seasoned traveler. It might be of help to the unitiated French tourist, but it tries too hard to be clever and funny. It's a fast, empty read."
3,A slow book with a slow plot,"This book follows closely on the heels of the second book in the series, the Memory of Earth. It really does not advance the plot too much, and it could have really been combined with the second book in order to make a much more riveting novel. The characters do not make any major advancements, but instead simply continue their current feelings and actions. No future plot developments really begin to develop till really the end of the book, and then you are left hanging, but for which you will thirst for the 4th book in the chapter.If you are looking for a single book then you would be better off to read the first in the series. But if you are reading the Homecoming series, you will want to pick this book up."
1,A dissapointing 3rd book...,"The first 2 Homecoming books in the series were much better than this one. You can basically skip this book in reading the series, because the only crucial part occurs at the end. The rest of the book is filled with dull descriptions and diaglogue of a boring trip through the desert. If you really want to know how the Homecoming series ends however, you should probably read this book, as boring as it may be."
1,Longest Eplilogue I've Ever Read.,"I read the first two books in a couple of days and enjoyed them. I moved on to book three and found it to be one of the most frustrating reads of my life.This book is full of errors, contradictions, and repetitions. It appears that the author and the editor didn't bother to re-read the first two books to check for consistency. And it really shows.Most of the character conflict has already been played out in the first two books or it is contrieved around information that contradicts information provided in the first two books. The characters are supposed to be several years older by the end of this book but they don't appear to have grown at all.My suggestion, skip this book. You won't be missing anything."
4,Good continuation of a plot,"Lots of sociology,ethics and politics PLUS murder and mayhem for spice. A matriachy on a fairly large scale and unfortunatly whinning males. The baby/adult males were the most difficult charetors to like or feel anything except contemt for. They are growing up at least some of them."
3,good,its definitely one of the slowest of the series and most of the things that happen in this book are not really relevant. Orson should of put this book into a chapter in the 2nd novel and made the 4th novel into two books.
2,Not great.,"I read this series as a child and really enjoyed It. I recently revisited it as an adult. Certain issues about the series struck me. 1) Gender determinism. While Card is weakly in favor of equality, he clearly feels that women are ""naturally"" going to serve certain roles and men will ""naturally"" fill other roles. Gross. 2) Homophobia. Some pretty disgusting language is used to describe homosexuality. On the one hand, if viewed simply in the context of the story and the characters, maybe Card can get a pass. But...in the larger context of our world, its really, really regrettable. 3) Arranged marriage of young girls. Coloring all of this is my adult understanding of Card's religious background. Overall, the series is ruined for me. I wish I hadn't revisited it and it had remained a pleasant memory. Also, fair warning to parents, you might want to consider the negative messages in these books before giving them to children or at least talking over these issues with young readers."
3,Editing issues in Kindle Edition,"The storyline is relatively decent. Not as great as the Xenocide/Ender universe, but pretty good.Other than claiming human civilization is only 10k yrs old, most of the universe in this series is fairly consistent with itself and with possibility. (I guess that's what we get for another religious exodus/diaspora derived work, but it still frustrated me that it ignores recorded history AND implies we could have lightspeed travel at almost any time now.)The characters are fairly well developed, and overall it flows fairly easily.The problem I have is that there are OCR errors all through these books which is an unacceptable editing quality for any format of book. Also, the maps and similar front matter are not high enough resolution to pick out all of the details from the original graphics.These limitations come across as disrespectful to the author and to the audience."
4,Cool Sunglasses,"These are wild sunglasses. The reflective coating on the lenses give a neat effect. The inside of the lenses (facing your eyes) are brown in color. (You can't tell that from Amazon's photographs). They're also lightweight, so I hardly notice that I'm wearing them.I like to use these glasses for cycling. They do a good job of keeping air out of my eyes. The lenses wrap around a bit to divert airflow. However, because the lenses are small, they don't fit snuggly around my eye sockets -- which allows some air to blow across my eyes as I cycle."
1,Did not fit...,"The part did not fit the application it popped up for (1999-2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Unlimited), looks like it fits a later model."
5,How hillarious!!,"This story had me falling off my chair! Too much. This story is one of the very best comedies I've ever read. The fantasy, well, all I can say is, breathtaking and bold! Way to go Stephen, can't wait for the second book."
3,"Good for a first step, but not the best","I disagree with the comment above, because the most important, relevant, full of evidence and with more than 10 year of research, about the COnstitutional and legal history of Puerto Rico, was wrote by Jose Trias Monge: ""Historia Constitucional de Puerto RIco"". 5 volumes full of evidence, articles and an objective and non-partisan views of the Puerto Rico history, specially the constitutional process and legacy from spain, EEUU and other countries. We cannot avoid the fact that he was a Yale Law School, with a LLM of the same school, an academic scholar and President of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court....."
1,Horrible battery life!!!,"Got the phone 2 days ago. Fully charge over night, went to work, battery run out before i got home!!! Total calls made = 4, Total minutes used = 10 mints, Total battery life < 10 hours! Return next day. Great looking phone, lot of functions, feel very well build, but terrrible battery life!"
2,Get ready to do some hacking.,I have had my i930 for about two months. I travel quite a bit so I really need the GSM feature. Nextel didn't do their regular customers any favors with this phone. I've been a Nextel subscriber for ten years and expected something better. I do have some good news for those owners that are daring enough to do some hacking. Sign on to [...] and pay the nerd that runs the sight $9.95 and you can download a program and a set of directions that will unlock this aggravating beast. From then on it will run anything that runs on any Windows smartphone. If Sprint really intends to continue selling this model they should unlock it. If I had a choice (I use it for work) I'd get rid of it and get something else.
1,Worst cell phone I've ever used,"I've had this phone for about a year and a half and I CANNOT wait until my contract is up. I originally got this phone because I was going to Italy and needed a phone that worked overseas.This phone is extrememly heavy and large as far as cell phones go and I am very disappointed with the options. You can't even change the volume of the alarm that goes off and it's unnecessarily loud.The battery life of this phone is the worst of any phone I've ever had. I have to charge it up at least once a day whereas with other phones, I could go three days without charging them.This phone is overpriced and nowhere near worth the money it costs. I would NOT recommend it to anyone."
2,Funky but uncomfortable,"It's a cool and funky style, but it was too wide and bulky. I returned them."
3,Smith & Wesson CK6M,"I got this knife because I have been meaning to try out some of the extreme ops knives from Smith and Wesson. There a few things I like about this knife and a few things I dislike. The blade came with a decent edge and the washers between the blade and linear's are larger then the average knife's and almost eliminate blade play entirely. That being said this knife (at least the one I received) is only 7.7 inches long not the 9.06 inches, that it is advertised as being. The thumb disk is to small to be useful. And my pocket clip came very stiff and only after using it a few times, had a noticeable wear line."
4,Good Investment,"It's worth it...I'm usually cheap and barely brought myself to spend this money but it actually improved gas mileage and it seems like the car runs better...not to mention the fact that you just have to wash it and put it back in, not having to buy another one again..."
1,"Where's Oxygen2,5, Calypso2 and MagFields4?","This pleasant techno hybrid remixes mostly Chronology with afew sustainable classics (equinox4 & 7, magfields2, calypso1,revolutions) and tries to bridge the gap between contemporaryJarre and late 90s dance. Being a fan of both, I found this album dissapointing as it neither broke new ground (as Jarre often has) or uses the euphoric rhythms of dance. So,not what it should've been considering some Jarre tracks are crying out for this treatment but aren't here(bet u can think of at least 10). This is better considered a B-side of Chronology, and so long as you loved that, or old skool techno, you might take to this."
1,GO WITH THE FIVE INCH SCREENS AND NOT THE SEVEN,"The 7 inch screens have terrible quality. The 5 inch screens are much better with the close range veiw you will most likely use while in a car or an a plane. When you are up close you think you were put in a time machine and sent back to the 1970's or 80's. If you want to use it as a regular TV and watch it from a distance go ahead and buy it, but I would go with the 5 inch."
4,great product but...,"dvd-lv70 is a great product. picture quality, sound, controls awesome. The only thing that bothered me was the battery. It does not seem to hold its charge. I charged it overnight, went to the airport, got on the plane, about an hour into the movie low battery ,dvd shuts off. It has done this several times, a defect? unknown. Recommend charging battery just prior to long stand alone usage."
5,It's all about the JAMS,"the 33 minute of Nantucket is a must have. The cd only has 4 songs on the album, but the live version of Crossroader is also a must have. Leslie's guitar playing is awesome, and corky and felix keep it going throughout the whole album. A must have for fellow mountain fans!"
5,MoodMusic,"Listen to this Sleighride and you will never want to hear the other versions again. It's trully waiting to take you away to anouther time before there was an economy, when man withdrew life from the earth with handmade tools and the sweat of his brow. I can feel the wind of the crows nest everytime I hear this."
2,Skip this and buy the original studio versions!,"Mountain brought us two highly melodic and eminently listenable tracks in their heyday: ""Nantucket Sleighride"" and ""For Yasgur's Farm"". Both these songs contain great chord changes, harmonies, and memorable lyrics, and combine super pop hooks with quality heavy rock musicianship. Tracks such as these laid the groundwork for future bands like Journey, Toto, and Mister Mister. However, this live album doesn't even hint at the true skill of Messrs West, Pappalardi, and Knight.""Live"" features boringly dull and repetitious solos; tedious ensemble playing; and weak singing -- all rendered through amps with the sound quality of those $49 jobs kids buy at WalMart. The playing is so lame in spots you'll wonder if you're actually hearing a warm-up band doing Mountain covers!Please do yourself a favor: Skip ""Live"", and buy the albums ""Climbing"" and ""Nantucket Sleighride"" to hear what these guys really sounded like."
4,Great Irish Folk Rock,"The duo of Sonny Condell and Leo O'Kelly survived a five year career until their split in 1974. But occassionally they reunite with better success, including a recent Live at the Hibernian release. Condell went on to form the band Scullion. Scullion has a sound that comprises a shifting and eccentric blend of folk, pop, jazz, reggae, blues and rock. Some of that blend one can still hear the sound of Tír Na Nóg live on. Both musician play the acoutic guitar and write some of the most quirky edged lyrics and melodies. Their debut album include the lively audience favorite, 'Aberdeen Agus'.The 'Strong in the Sun' album has strong singing, sensitive guitars and some of the duo's best songs that include the anthemic 'Free Ride' with accompaniment by Nick Drake, and the melodic title track. This moves much closer to Rock as does their 'A Tear and a Smile' album. If you like a mix of Frank Zappa and Shawn McGowan then try out this album."
4,Cult Classic,"If you like obscure Irish folk-rock of the 1970's, this is a must-have album. I especially love the ""B"" side. Use of traditional Celtic instruments (clay pots and pipes) in combination with contemporary instrumentation and haunting lyrics create a unique, other-worldly sound. If you like it, you'll love it, and will want Tir Na Nog's only other album, A Tear and a Smile."
5,EXITOSO GRUPO DEL FUTURO,"This cd is wonderful for those who love spanish heartwrenching songs about love. It's a mixture of R&B;, soul, and my favorite,Bachata. Beautiful cd the singers all have excellent voices. Can't wait till the next album. Love you guys""VOZ A VOZ SENTIMIENTOS"""
1,Item is not what it is portrayed to be,"I ordered this CD expecting it to have 17 songs but when I played it, it only had 12 tracks. It is missing tracks 3 (Alegres Cantad) and 4 (Aires de Pascuas), 6 (El Niño del Tambor) and 7 (Ay del Chiquirritin) and 12 (Frosty el Muñeco de Nieve).Itis a shame that Amazon lends itself to this false advertising and that the manufacturer, Delta Entertainment Corporation is allowed to get away with it.Shame on you Amazon!!!!"
3,one-album band,"Just to correct the previous reviewer's assertion that the Count Five made several other albums after ""Psychotic Reaction"" (which, by the way, is not what this CD represents-- this is rather a collection of songs from the original LP plus b-sides and singles)--> they did NOT record a thing! Lester Bangs invented it all. Too many have taken his word for it, but any who do would be in vain were they to search for the records Mr Bangs talks about in such detail and with such enthusiasm."
2,Weak except for the title song,"These one-hit wonders put out this album which basically consists of the terrific title song and lots of more pedestrian filler. Unless you are curious or a completist, all you really need is a single of ""Psychotic Reaction."" If you can't find a single (and most likely you will not, these days), get it on one of the many '60s compilations out there -- the original ""Nuggets"" compilation being the best choice, if you can still find that. I had the good fortune of finding this Count Five album on vinyl in a bargain bin for about $3, and I snatched it. It's certainly worth that price, but I would hesitate at spending a CD price for it."
5,Can't believe they're instant,"I tried these a few years ago because they were on sale at the local supermarket. I was back to get more the very next day. They're outstanding. I can't believe that all I have to do is add water -- no milk, no butter, nothing but water! I can't make garlic mashed potatoes from scratch this flavorful.My only complaint is that they're not that easy to find anymore in my local Safeway. And the other grocery chain carries another product (Betty Crocker) which just isn't as good."
4,very useful,this is a very usefull book that can help me wiht various n64 games plus that its a small book & portatble 2 take anywhere!!
2,Not as nice as the picture,"It functions well enough, but the break in the material where it loops back on itself is in plain sight (rather than behind the wall where it should be). It looks like I just bent up a thick coat hanger and slapped it on my cubical wall."
4,did not fit cubicle,"My cube farm has a cap rail on all partitions. This makes it too wide for the hook. My apartment has narrow internal doors, so I used it at home.It is fine, but as always, I looked for another use due to the high shipping/return costs."
1,Poorly engineered,"This hunter's watch is indispensable for the guy who needs to know the temperature of his wrist 15-30 minutes ago. It also has a stopwatch and count down timer that you can use any time neither the hour hand nor the minute hand are obscuring it. To its credit, it's pretty heavy, so it's good exercise and may also have some use as in wrist-to-paw combat situations. As I understand it though, most hunters prefer to kill from a distance using a high power weapon. As a timepiece, I'm sure it's accurate, but setting the time is a pain: no stem, so you have to push a button combination that only advances the minute hand forward slowly even at the fast speed. Maybe the reason it doesn't have a stem is because they are worried that the mercury for the useless thermometer (no kidding) will leak out more readily. I returned mine a few days after the purchase.I've been a Casio fan for years owing to their logic and affordability. This watch, however, was a waste of time."
4,Casio Men's watch,"The watch comes with a cmuflage bracelet, I did not like that. The digital numbers are sometimes hard to read under certain light conditions. Over all, I liked the watch."
5,Incredible,"From ""No Rope As Long As Time"" to ""The Truth About John"", this is probably the most powerful music I have ever heard. The lyrics, mood, and instrumental mix is unmatched in any other music I have heard. Buy this CD before it is too late ...it is out of print. I have been looking for this CD for 2 years."
5,Remember 'Radio Africa' ?,"The only reason I give this 5 stars is because it doesn't seem possible to give it six. In 1986 when this album was first released it almost immediately became my favourite ever album. Thirteen years later it still is.To describe this CD in words is perhaps like trying to describe a great painting; it is impossible to do it justice. Do you remember Radio Africa? It's haunting melody is a good taster of what this CD is all about, musically stunning, lyrically informed and articulate, I have yet to meet anybody who has heard the CD and not been impressed.If you want something with immortal qualities, to remain special for a lifetime this is a CD that you must buy."
5,One of my very all-time favorites,"When this album came out in 1986 I was working in a record store and we started playing the promo - it hardly came off of the player after that. I had the tape but wore it out in the early 90s, and now that the CD is in print, I've just ordered it, can't WAIT until I hear songs like ""Seaport September"" again."
3,Thought Provoking At Best,This book was insightful. I found the material was interesting and thought provoking.I did not much care for the way the book was produced. The material appeared to be several blog postings the author had written in the past and decided to put them into a book. (Maybe this was intentional)In all the book does not really give you a roadmap on how-to but it does give you really excellent material to get you at least thinking in the right direction.
2,Lets stereotype software,"Interesting and thought provoking ideas.But at its heart this book is a manual about how to stereotype software people.So if you are a lazy hiring manager with no personal skills and no personal agility or intuition about people, this will help you maximimize the probability of hiring the right people.It would probably be better to get someone on your team with some people skills, though, since your stereotyping is going to give you the people who play the game best, not the best."
2,Terence D,"Really I'd prefer to give this about 2.5 stars. The information and advice in this book *seems* good but my main complaint is that Eric Sink has never started a micro-ISV, and worse, for the sake of the book he did attempt to start a micro-ISV and it failed miserably. He did this near the beginning of the book. I always thought he was going to go back to this later on in the book and apply some of his own advice to his failed first attempt and turn it around but he never did."
4,Nice to read. Good advises. Specific for a type of bussiness software.,"As a software developer, i recommend this book, easy to read, simple, many good advises....I only complain that the writer mainly talks about his specific field. He runs a software company specialized in tools for IDE's. Consequently, he only advises or see the bussiness software from the point of view of a company which sells software products to the market.br"
5,Excellent book!,"This is an excellent book for anyone starting, or contemplating starting, a software business (aka ISV). Eric's writing is clear, insightful and witty, and although his writing style is engaging, his advice and wisdom are invaluable; his knowledge of running a software business comes from hands-on experience.About three years ago I was lucky enough to discover Eric Sink's writings via his blog site. He was one of the few sources that I could find that provided the ""how to"" for starting a bootstrapped software business. At the time, my dream was to start a software business, and today, I can honestly say that he played a major role in the realization of that dream.Buy the book!"
1,No Show,It's hard to review an item I never received. I was forwarded a communcation saying this product was not available. One star was the lowest I could give.
2,Poor Transfr,"This is a decent movie but I cannot give it a better review because the transfer is terrible. The monogram, ER, of the issuing company shows throughout the whole movie. This is definitely a very low definition version of the movie. Maybe the system the company used to add their monogram made the film look like it's being watched through a gauze. There are also some places where the picture breaks up.This is really a shame because I enjoyed the movie."
4,Natural dog biscuits without wheat ingredient,Our two labs love Cinna-bone Biscuits. I refuse to purchase dog food products that contain wheat so this Solid Gold products meets my test of a more natural product. You can actually smell the cinnamon in these dog treats.
1,Not for Blackberry8220,"The product description listed Blackberry as compatible with this headset, so I ordered it. Unfortunately it does not fit my Blackberry 8220."
4,It worked for 2 weeks and now I cannot hear anything from it. Going to return it if seller contacts me what to do.,"This product worked for only 2 weeks and now I can't hear anything through it. It worked great those 2 weeks and suddenly broke on me. I'm disappointed because I received this product in a professional packaging and was very happy when I tried it the first week. Please send me a new one and I can return the old one. Thanks. ***Update as of 1/7/2013 - Talkie Tech sent me a new one that arrived on Saturday, Jan. 5. It's the same professional packaging but I haven't opened it yet to try on my phone. I wanted to write an updated review about their promptness and courteous response."
1,never worked,"didnt work when I got it. I think it was used, said verizon on it but came in a crappy plastic bag. was too cheap to bother with returning."
1,dont buy,it didnt work with my lg phone.. i couldnt hear anything through the speaker and i tried everything but its just a crappy piece of equipment.
2,Hurts my ear and no one can hear me...,This headset is really uncomfortable. It feels the earpiece is made out of a round razor blade with a thin piece of foam over it. It's as if the ear piece is just way too big for my ear hole. I can't wear it for more than a minute but it doesn't matter because the person on the other end can never hear me on it anyway. At least it was cheap.
1,Does NOT fit most BlackBerry phones (which are 3.5mm)!,"Says ""BlackBerry"" in the title description but does NOT fit most BlackBerry phones which need 3.5 mm headsets. Can get an adapter to go from 2.5mm to 3.5mm otherwise. Note that the seller states ""we make no claim or guarantee of compatibility between products; it is the responsibility of the consumer to ensure compatibility prior to completing order."" It has a Verizon logo on the headset. It doesn't feel like the most comfortable fit either."
2,Doesn't fit my Blackberry,The earphone works fine with my LG phone but I bought it for my Blackberry and the jack is too small.
1,Works top notch,"I've used Plantronics headsets for probably 50 years. Initially when flying oceanic runs for air to ground contact, and later with ham radio. I purchased the MX203-X! Mobile Headset to try it out and it worked so well that I purchased several more to give to my family to use. Recommend without reservations."
1,NOT FOR BLACKBERRIES OR SMARTPHONES!!!!,"Most smartphones and blackberries now require 3.5 mm headsets. So if you have a blackberry or smartphone, do NOT buy this. It will not work with your phone."
2,"Other person can't hear me, unconfortable","I bought three of these for me and my employees. The person on the other end of the phone complains that they cannot hear us. If we take off the headset, they can hear us just fine. We have tried two different phones and it still does the same thing."
3,"Sound great on both ends, BUT...",I keep looking for the perfect corded headset for my cell phone. Bluetooth is not an option. This headset sounds better on both ends than any other I've tried. The only problem is after a long session my earlobe is sore. The speaker is very large which I'm sure contributes to the good sound even though it doesn't fit in my ear well. If this headset attached over the ear like some of the Jabra headsets it would be the best of all.
4,Everyone can Hear me and I can hear them...,Good Purchase. I was looking to cut down the amount of time I have a cell phone stuck to the side of my head due to safety and comfort. This product is great. It is affordable and everyone I called can hear me perfectly and I can hear them. It's nice to not have to hold the phone the entire time. Highly recommend this.
1,Doesn't work with Blackberry 8330,This should not list Blackberry in the title as it didn't work with my 8330 and just found another review that it doesn't work with the 8220. And it's annoying because it's not really worth it to pay shipping to return to Amazon.
2,DIdn't work with Blackberry,It was stated that this headphone would work with a blackberry but it's not the right size. I guess I should have checked more carefully but took it at face value. I did try the headphone with one of home phones and the microphone did not seem to pick up my voice very well. I'm not sure how much I will even use it as I wanted it for my cell phone.
2,"NOT Plantronics and not for any Android phone, even LG","Obviously I should have done more research to find out that my LG Android phone is not compatible with this 2.5 mm jack. Even otherwise, this was a generic brand, not plantronics. I did consider buying the converter for an extra couple bucks after I realized that this was too small for my phone 3.5mm jack, but I couldn't quite get it to be comfortable on my ear and the reviews for the cheaper converters didn't look too promising. The seller also has a 7-day return policy, so I could not return it either. So, I'm stuck with it even though I have no use for it!"
3,Lasted about 6 months,"This headset lasted a little under 6 months. In the end, the microphone stopped working. Since this type is the only one that works on my ear, I ordered again and will see if this lasts a little longer. I am not hard on this equipment either. Thanks."
2,"Semi-functional but ugly, not as pictured","This headset works in that you can hear the person, and the person can hear you. However, even with the ear lobe clamp, the earbud always comes out of my ear within a few seconds. In its original condition, this headset was not functional for me since it wouldn't stay in my ear. However, I made the earbud stay in my ear by taking an old Jabra fitted ear gel and putting it over the ear bud. With this alteration, the ear bud stays in, making the head set work pretty well.The headset that I received was not the headset pictured. What I received is an ugly, red, plastic headset. Tacky. It says Verizon wireless on the side."
3,Good Story,"The story itself was wonderful. I could not put the book down because I wanted to find the ""happy ending"". However, I was constantly pulled away from the story by the poor editing. There are too many uses of words that are incorrect, words completely missing from a sentence, and the use of improper grammar. The overuse of the word ""sexy"" became annoying. It would have been nice to have the two characters that really seem to be soulmates end up together, but the book was made more real by the ending the author chose. I'd love to read more from this author, but I can not bring myself to overlook the constant interruptions that a good editor would have eliminated."
5,Must read,"I tried to read this book slowly, but that just didn't happen. It moved at such a pace I couldn't put it down. I liked Zarembski's first book, which lead me to Embers in the Sky. Her improvement as an author really came through in this book. I read a lot of books and Zarembski is going to be one that I will keep going back to. She is a staple on my bookshelf with the way she captivates you with her stories, and makes you feel for her protagonists, she is an amazing new and refreshing author."
4,Good study,"This is the only full length treatment of Thomas Jefferson during the Rev War. I would not call it a history of Jefferson as a war leader, but it is a valubale account of how TJ handled Virginia during the Revolutionary War from a military standpoint. This is also a balanced account, which does recognize TJ's failures, esp. in 1781."
4,Thermos for grownups,"I own this product. I like it, it is thoughtfully constructed. It reminds me of my Apollo Mission thermos I had in 1st grade, except is is plainly colored, no pictures, is bigger, and did not come with a groovy lunchbox with a picture of the moon on it.Can be completely disassembled, as I needed to do to pour out the water that accumulated in the bottom during cleaning."
2,disappointing,"I got the Norwegian book from this course (Teach Yourself) before and it's amazing. So I was expecting more with this book. I understand that Icelandic is extremely harder to learn than Norwegian, but this book is definetly bad. At least for beginners. I've learned alot more just with free online courses. This book is just alot of grammer, really. And it's extremely outdated.If you're trying to learn Iceland, this book won't help you. Perhaps if you're intermediate, but not for beginners."
3,Will inspire many future bookburnings,"This is a frustrating book, but it has a certain internal coherence. Check out delphi.com/islenska, a free forum for folks trying to learn Icelandic. A good supplement to Glendening's evil, indispensable codex"
1,I wish it weren't so bad that I couldn't get past the first chapter,"This book has defects galore.1) Walls of tables of various forms. Intimidating, not useful.(see pp21-24)2) The chapters often lack dialogs or readings. That which exists, often consists of disjointed example sentences and difficult idioms.3) All the Icelandic is in italics, a strain on the eyes.4) This sure isn't for beginners and I'm not sure an advanced student would benefit much from it either.Don't buy this helvitis andskotin book. You won't get past chapter one before you fling it out a window. You may learn how to curse in Icelandic in the process though."
2,"Good for a brief overview, but not for serious study.","The book is written in almost reverse order of what the student will want to know. It is short on every-day examples of speech. It does a poor job of explaining the case structure as a concept; it just says ""learn this"". The vocabulary in the glossaries is very limited. Students who have studied German and know about cases (as I have)will have an easier time, but not much. I'd pass...Ironically, the TY series has an excellent Russian book, as well as an excellent Norwegian one. I guess PJ just wanted to do his own thing..."
5,Glendening,"If you really want to learn Icelandic, you are going to have to buy all of the books on the market and work and work and work on it for several years. No single book is going to do the whole job, and furthermore, the job will never be fully completed. Each book adds a little bit to your journey. Accept them all for whatever good they can do. Anyway, this book can teach you to say all kinds of interesting things, such as ""Hva er ori af henni? Hún drekkti sér í brunninum."" (What has become of her? She drowned herself in the well.) and ""Láttu mig í frii, ég brenndi mig"" (Leave me in peace, I burned myself). They just don't make 'em like that anymore."
1,Not for the general student,"This book is not like the other fine books of the Teach Yourself series, as it has not been revised like the other language books have. If you want to learn Icelandic this book will not really help you to do so, it has a difficult layout and is not geared toward learning to speak & understand. It's really only a good book for linguists interested in Icelandic grammar. TY books really should publish a newer edition."
1,Sketchy and Poorly Edited,"While this book may be reasonable for linguists or people with extensive experience with Scandinavian languages, it is virtually intractable for newcomers to the field. Grammatical concepts are merely sketched with little or no explanation. The pronunciation guide is extremely cumbersome, listing phonetic symbols without clearly telling students which Icelandic letters represent which sounds. Translation exercises require grammatical concepts before they have been introduced in the text and the glossary is woefully incomplete. Definitely NOT a text for beginners!"
4,John Cale's pop music,"Vintage Violence is one of those albums where you just can't believe your ears the first time you hear it. Any expectations at all you bring into this will be blown away about four bars into ""Hello There""; you'll realize there is so much more to this guy than the feedback/experimental genius you hear on the first two VU albums. Cale reveals himself here as a student of pop songwriting in the line of the early BeeGees and Paul McCartney. Actually, songs like ""Adelaide"" and ""Cleo"" sound like lost B-sides from the Merseybeat era. His adventurousness displays itself on the swirling climax to ""Ghost Story"" where he finds the perfect instrumental only to mercilessly cut the song short, leading into the closer ""Fairweather Friend."" The highlight here is ""Amsterdam,"" a drop-dead beautiful song that Lou Reed could never have written. This isn't John Cale's best album (try the more cohesive ""Fear""), but this is a gem that ought to be in every record store and in any pop fan's collection."
5,Final Report Review,This final report arrived in the condition described on Amazon.com prior to the anticipated arrival date provided to me upon purchase.
5,Plus One: A Year in the Life of a Hollywood Nobody,"What a joy, I loved every moment of this masterpiece. It was hightly amusing, brutally honest and very enlightening. I could hear the writer's voice lifting off the page. I do hope that Claire Fordham pens a sequel, I have to know what happens to Muttley and I have ordered a copy of 'The Sound of Music'."
1,A poopy book,"I thought this book was pretty disappointing. I was hoping for a light humorous book with some insights into Hollywood and California culture, as seen by someone Not From Around Here, but it turned out to be mostly about the author's battles with a dog that pooped everywhere. There's hardly a page where the dog doesn't poop. And there's not much about the author actually doing anything or meeting anyone of importance. I don't know why it was written or published."
2,Misleading Book Title,"Based on the reviews I read here, I anticipated a super-humorous book.Based on the title of the book, I was expecting to read a LOT more about Claire's experiences in the Hollywood party scene (as Julia Fordham's ""Plus One""). I felt like the book title was quite misleading.However, I do agree that this is a down-to-earth, ""Bridget Jones"" type story. It is amusing, but not particularly exciting. I appreciated the 'translations' of British terms and expressions at the bottom of some pages! Claire is a very good writer. Again, I just think the book title was inappropriate."
5,The Perfect Read,"Once I had opened this book to read I could not put it down, it's absolutely the funniest thing I have ever read. I had loads of curious looks on the bus as I was laughing out loud, something you can't help do when reading this book. Unfortunately I finished it far too quickly and can only hope there are more to come. An absolutley fantastic read."
4,Good Supplement,"These vitamins are full of great food-sourced nutrients and do give me more energy. I gave them four stars instead of five because they are bitter and dry and hard to swallow, unlike the Rainbow Light prenatals."
4,"Great product, awful smell","This is a great B complex. Gentle on the stomach but I can feel the extra boost of energy when I take them. The only thing I don't like about them is the smell. They have a very strong vitamin smell. You don't taste it once it's taken, and it doesn't keep me from using them but I do hold my breath until it is swallowed."
5,An excellent food based Complete B-Complex,"Because your body recognizes a food based vitamin as food other than a chemical, it processes and absorbs it more naturally. This is an excellent product. It arrived in a timely fashion and the price was great. I've been taking this for nearly 2 years and it has made a healthy difference in my life."
1,Causing me tummy ache & acid stomach.,"This after I've taken this formula exclusively for many years. One thing I will say is that the last bottle & this most recent one, not only had the label changed.. but the taste of them also changed. They have always been somewhat strong tasting, but not terribly unpleasant. They taste sickening now. I went off them a few days & my stomach was fine the very first day. I just took one & almost immediately my tummy hurts & feels very heavy. Almost a full bottle left. As yucky as I feel right now, I will never take another one. In case anyone is wondering, I took it about 30 minutes, or more, after a good meal. With plenty of filtered water."
2,Ho Hum!,"This is not bad, I suppose if you are a big fan you'll enjoy it. I just found it musically very weak and VERY boring."
2,Save your tooth fairy money,"Adding ""Queen Denteena"" and the ""Decay Prevention Ball"" to the basic tooth fairy tale is more than a stretch -- it is a strain!Queen Denteena shouts ""Idiot!"" twice at the boy in the story because he has lost his tooth -- not helpful to those of us teaching 5 - 8 year olds to avoid name-calling. The story ends with the passive tooth fairy appeasing the aggressive Queen Denteena with the help of the boy. Good does not triumph over bad in this story - it simply figures out another way to get along. This results in the tooth fairy's report card going from all ""F's"" to all ""A's."" Everyone has a good time at the Decay Prevention Ball.There are too many story twists and no satisfying ending. Oh, yes... the boy does receive a quarter."
3,cute story but too much name calling,I agree ...that points out the name calling issue. We see this every where we don't need it in book.But it is a cute little story about the tooth fairy.
1,Just awful,"Even before the fairy Queen Denteena called the little boy an IDIOT, I wasn't impressed with the book. The protagonist is the only character in the story who doesn't have a name. The plot is pretty dumb. The illustrations are atrocious -- the tooth fairy is completely unappealing, and even the little boy in the the book looks like a middle-aged man. I was absolutely shocked to find the word IDIOT not once, but twice. Who on earth writes this stuff? There are much better choices out there for young readers."
4,Fun source history. Material pretty well organized,Enjoyed this book. A chapter in history I knew little about.Source material nice to read.The author could have been a little freer to draw conclusionsKen Young
4,Great Book that needs some maps,"Confident Hope of a Miracle is a well-researched history of the attempted invasion of Britain during the time of Elizabeth the First. What is remarkable about the story is the position of Spain as world's superpower and it total failure to understand the changes that were occurring in Naval Warfare. My only criticism, not one usable map."
3,use common sense,"despite what you've seen in the movies, swords were never meant to cut trees. even a good axe will dull after hitting a green tree.this is obviously for display purposes. if you entertain fantasies of actually cutting people with swords, then you're probably crazy enough to spend the thousands for a real, quality weapon. this item is basically a shape, stamped out of 1/8th inch thick steel. it is very light; too light to cause any real harm. in an actual combat situation, you'd be better off with your bare fists, or even a swiss-army knife.however, if you're into collection for display, this is a nice cheapie that'll impress the casual onlooker."
2,Not bad,The sword is ok the sheath is not what u get the package came with the tip of the blade stabbing out of the box .....so yeah sharp but there are better ones out there
3,Remember its a Cheap sword!,"Ok, nice looking but the handle came apart about an hour after use and was useless.It's cheap so what can you expect."
3,What.,"There's this weird coat that has traces of the bubbles from the plastic, i guess kind of like a wax? It makes the blade look ugly,, but its still a pretty cool sword"
4,Full tang black blade,"I was pleased with this purchase, the handle is nicely wrapped and much better quality than other similar products. The blade is full tang which means it was made out of one solid piece of metal from tip to hilt. the sheath was also quite reasonable considering the price for the item. Overall it's a solid blade and not flimsy with a comfortable wrapping around the handle that does not seem like it will un-ravel anytime soon. Pleased with purchase"
4,Cool little sword for the money,"This sword came fast with Prime. I feel to review this sword properly one must consider the price point. Superb craftsmanship? No. Tree chopper? Absolutely not but what you do get is a cool, full tang, inexpensive sword. I keep mine next to my bed. The woven handle as people have mentioned will loosen and come undone with use but just rewrap it tightly and secure with a method of your choice. The blade is very cool looking and had a surprising edge on it. Not razor sharp but sharper than a lot of blades come these days and can be honed to your liking. The sheath is cheap and flimsy but for the cost is ok. Like i said before, use your machete, axe or large fixed blade for bushcrafting and use this for fun, intimidation factor and Zombies."
4,Not bad for the money,"Well i just received this today, and after a thorough review of the blade itself i decided to give it four stars. It is a solid blade that has the potential to last quite a while without the annoyance of parts becoming loose or falling off like many of the katanas i have purchased in the past. It is full tang, which was great(after reading many negative reviews saying it wasnt). the blade isnt the sharpest but that was to be expected( i have some blades from the same company which were the same). Now my only beef is the wrappings on the handle, but i figured it would be falling off at some point this isnt some hand wrapped piece of art but a cheap blade with factory wrapped handles. overall it is worth the price, and i am happy with my purchase."
3,Picture is Inaccurate!,"It's a nice sword and seems very durable. It has a fine sharpened edge however mine doesn't have the ""teeth"" on the leading edge of the blade as shown in the picture. Only dull teeth on the trailing edge.I am happy with this purchase. I'm only pointing out that it differs slightly from the image shown."
3,Decent for the price,"Although I am accustomed to sharper swords, this serves well enough if you need something to intimidate those who threaten you. I would not trust it to perform too magnificently in actual combat, though it is more of a show sword."
4,This thing is Huge!!!,"Being an European, I still have not much clue about how 27"" represent. I do know after receiving this blade... It is huge!It looks like a mini sword.The blade is all painted in black, it is also pretty sharp and should not be put into anyone's hands. It is clearly not a toy!The sheath provided with it does the job of holding it well.The construction quality seems fair, providing that you won't try fighting with it in real life. I considered taking it to the woods and using it as a machete to make my own path and then gave up the idea... People may think that I am a lunatic on the loose...So it stays home as a decoration.For the price I pay for it, I do consider it a good acquisition. For it's usefulness in everyday life, I would say none but it is not it's purpose..."
4,Duplicate,This is the EXACT SAME sword as the Secret Agent Tactical Ninja Sword... EXACTLY the same.. Why?
3,Hollywood ninja,"Well got it today ,came super dull i can bend blade easily with one hand some of the paint came chipped of tip.cord on handle is loose.as for fighting off ninjas you'd be sushi before you got it out the lame holster .this is for looks only that's why i gave it 3 stars for display purposes only its not as long as people say to me its a big knife .but it is rather cool looking.a weapon it is not if your looking for a weapon you'd be better off with a machete .I should of got the machete but I listened to the positive reviews from people who don't know much about weapons. All in all if you want a cool display I guess you could buy this and be happy just don't plan on using it for defense you'd be scr* wed."
3,Not impressed.. but looks cool.,"Ok, I love amazon.com They always have fast shipping. The sword however isn't anything special. I can bend the blade with one hand. The blade didn't come sharp at all. The tip is sharp. It looks sweet but unless you sharpen it.. its no good for you. The sheath is garbage. My recommendations for this sword..-Wall Decoration-Slashing zombies- 3 zombies max.-Taking it to the woods to hit it against things to see how long it breaks."
3,BC,"This product is OK. Mine was sliced though the sheath, but I did not contact the seller for this. I realized it was a cheap purchase. I bought it for whacking bananas and small limbs. That is all it will be able to do. Worth the money yes, but more show than practical."
5,Clurmshot,This has certainly been an excellent buy!It is really sharp and durable and its bigger than it looks!great for hunting!!!!definetly a clurmshot buy!Clurmshot TODAY!
3,Just ok.,It's ok for the money but if your looking for great quality this is not it. A bit flimsy in my opinion.
3,Nifty,Bought this for a gift. It is exactly how the description reads. I didn't experience the blade coming through the hilt tho.
1,do not buy!!,Shipping was horrible and package showed up damaged. The sword does not look as described in picture and info. Sword hand feels cheap and loose covering. The sword case was also cheaply made and ripped the first time that I put the sword in it carefully. I do not recommend this product!
4,Good stuff but,"It was everything it said it was, and i was not unhappy with the product at all, i was just annoyed with the packaging because the tip of the blase kept stabbing through it and also ruined the wrapping paper"
4,Good for the price.,I purchased this sword for no reason other than to fool around with it. It came in somewhat sharp on the edges and the point was very sharp; however if you are looking for it to be very sharp out of the box(and I don't know why you would) then this isn't for you. It did required a little sharpening to get it to my preferred edge.The sheath is the only concern I have with this item. When it arrived it already had a hole where it looked like it cut through when it was being put in and when you slide it down to the bottom it pokes through. In other words the sheath needs to have some-sort of lining in it where as this product does not.
3,The Machete is great but the Sheath....,"The Blade itself is sharp and does a great job at blazing a trail. The Sheath on the other hand is just a piece of nylon. This is great if the tip was blunted but the tip is pointy, like really pointy, and cuts through the front of the sheath. I had to get a blacksmith friend to put a metal tip on the front of my nylon sheath and even though he is a friend, it wasn't cheap to get that done."
4,Decent,"Okay, so the picture of the sword is a bit misleading. Also the sheath is very fragile. If you want to play around with this sword, gets some duct tape and wrap the bottom of the sheath... trust me, it will last a bit longer this way. The cord wrapped around the handle is strong enough that you can use it to swing above your head, though this is unadvised.The sword is one solid black piece of stainless steel and seems very durable. It isn't very sharp, yet sharp enough that you want to watch where you swing it. Fast delivery, had it delivered in 3 days when amazon said it would arrive 6-10 days after purchase. Definitely a good purchase."
2,Disapointed,The blade I ordered was what I recieved. I was disapointed to recive it damaged. There were two deep scratches in the metal. I will not be able to use it for the plaque I ordered it for. :(
3,"Damn The Flesh, Give Me Steel.","I bought this sword a year ago, I haven't really used it for anything but a wall decoration, But it's a good piece of steel for the money. It is a bit thin, but i've owned machete's that were just as thin and were expected to do heavy field work(chopping brush and so forth.) After a good sharpening this would be a forminable blade."
1,"crappy ""ninja"" sword",okay idk how many people who bought this peice of crap was welded at the hilt just right before the big point at the bottom after the blade ends but asside from being welded it was a low quality weld i would save your money and buy a fulll tang swprd its price and its looks are all that this thing has going for it. dont buy a cheap sword becus that normaly means its a cheap quality.
2,terrible,I was very excited When I got this for christmas it was very sharp and cool looking.The first time I went outside to use it it seemed great but the first time I tapped it against a tree to see how strong it was it snapped right above the handle.DO NOT BUY THIS SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1,Near-Useless Garbage,"This is an unreadable, low quality text. The theorems and proofs are explained in a ridiculously formal and boring style. I challenge you to read and understand a full page of this book on your first try. Avoid at all costs, and if your professor is using this text, avoid the course at all costs, and try talking some sense into your professor."
4,"Unique, Weird and Wonderful","Robin's first solo album is a mixture of endearingly melodic and wistful tunes (""Strings in the Earth and Air"", ""Rends-Moi Demain"", ""Dark-Eyed Lady""), idiosyncratic almost-rock (""Sandy Land""), downright strange but utterly compelling songs (""Cold Harbour"") and some which are just strange (""Through the Horned Clouds"") along with one of his finest pieces of medieaval magicke and mystery - the astonishing ""Dancing of the Lord of Wier"". This was basically Robin unshackled by the demands of being part of a group (even a group as eclectic as the String Band), giving his imagination full rein and having the time of his life. If you like his work in the String Band, you will love this album. Get it just for ""The Lord of Wier"", but you will find much more to enjoy. Incidentally,""Strings in the Earth and Air"" was given a surprise but very welcome airing at the recent String Band gigs."
1,Old Hat in New Fiction,"Mr. Stewart's novella read like so many of his vapid, pop-culture-driven contemporaries. His prose is heavy and stilted, creating a pace that does not fit the want for movement of the plot. If you're looking for well-crafted fiction with a flare for the unexpected or bizarre, I would suggest reading Douglas Coupland, Thom Jones, or Katherine Dunn over Stewart. Hell, I'd even prefer to read Foucault on the ...."
3,Bought and Sold,I really can't give an honest review since I didn't get to use it but it sure looks like a useful product that will do what it should. When I received it I noticed I bought the wrong thing because my mini tape is a different size than the one this is for so I sold it back at a lower price and called it even for my mistake.
3,Video VHS Adapter,"This is an all right item. Very inexpensive and a little rough sounding while in use, but does the job."
1,Not what I thought,It broke the first day I got it. It also wasn't the thing I thought I needed. The hi-8 tapes I have did not fit in it
1,Failed before it could ever be used,"Upon first use, the cassette installed correctly, however the tape did not tension.While examining the adapter, a small piece of plastic fell out.Afterwards, the arm that tensions the tape went to it's normal position, but the arm refused to move and the door was stuck in the open position.This adapter is junk."
2,bought another brand,"got 2 days use out of it and, granddaughter dropped it and it went into pieces. dropping could be the problem, but just bought another brand less expensive and seems fine sorry"
4,VHS-C Adapter,This adapter does what it was made to do and not badly priced. There was nothing on the small tape I found. So I was disapointed.
3,Vhc adapter,may need to order a battery one next time the manual one works just must be lined up careful and have patients. Not good for kids to use.
3,hard to use,"sometimes the tape goes in easily sometimes a struggle,it would be nice if it was automatic,also some tapes played ok some didnt,but it was cheap"
1,Beware. Don't use this product.,"I would caution you to not use this product. This is the second one I have used. I thought the first one was just defective so dummy me I bought another one. So, instead of losing one family video I now have had two vidoes destroyed by this machine twisting the tape. I saved the tape and hope to maybe find someone who can salvage some of it as memories cannot be redone. It played three fourths of my home Christmas video and then the tape got twisted in it. Like I said I gave it a second chance by purchasing two. I'm writing this review in hopes of preventing someone else losing their memories."
4,Great sink for the price,Looks great and provides enough room in both sides to wash dishes of all sizes.
5,Thanks to Xplosiv for making it possible to play on XP.,I wanted to play the old game on XP. I could not make it work. This game makes it possible. It was great to play again. And will be again some day.
2,"Disappointed, Out of Date","Yeh, this really shows how careful you need to be in purchasing PC games these days in 2008. I decided be buy this game at a very low price, because it had great reviews and I had just recently played AVP 2, which was also a few years old, but the AVP 2 demo was fantastic and the scarriest PC game I ever played (in the demo you can play as the marine only).No, the graphics are very bad really, and the marine really has like no chance at all to survive. The game should be playable. One gets spoiled these days with the new stuff out, and lets hope it stays that way.Final Comment: Avoid this game and go for the second edition AVP 2. Download the demo first (its not too long), then buy that one if you like it. Be Prepared, it is scarry as hell."
1,Not For Me,Good ---- if you want a textbook for a course in military history. Not good ---- if you're looking for a good read or coffee table book.
3,A new experience,"Yes, I've heard Julius Caesar a number of times via NPR and have two CDs. I confess I gave this DVD only three stars because I don't yet ""dig"" it. While the costumes and scenery are stunning to look at (mostly) and while I understand that, like Idomeneo, the singers are costumed in what might have been expected in the late 18th C, it always strikes me as quite odd - I mean, all that labor and money when a couple of sheets might do very well.I'll accept that Dame Janet is superb, but I believe I was expecting a more powerful voice (yes, I know that's dumb). I'm not crazy about counter-tenors, but in this case, I was surprised that I longed for David Daniels.The English (and I bought it FOR that reason) was very off-putting and I very much missed the Italian. The English, to me, made the opera sound just awfully stodgy. It may take me a while to like this DVD, but I'll watch it from time to time until I've determined that it and I are hopeless or that I really like it."
3,Interesante revisión inglesa.,"En esta representación de ""Julio César"", de 1984, cantada en inglés, el papel titular lo asume una JANET BAKER que, aunque mayor, se muestra muy notable, con una interpretación a tener en cuenta. VALERIE MASTERSON (Cleopatra), aunque con una Cleopatra de alto nivel, peca de agudos algo metálicos y alguna aspereza de emisión. SARAH WALKER (Cornelia) canta bien, pero sobreactúa cuanto quiere su papel, mientras que DELLA JONES se alza con un fuerte triunfo personal, con un Sesto magníficamente cantado e interpretado. Cumple JAMES BOWMAN (Ptolomeo) y muy bien JONH TOMILSON (Achila). Batante bien los secundarios. La orquesta de la ENO suena todo lo bien que CHARLES MACKERRAS puede lograr con su brillante dirección. La producción está bien pensada, aunque por momentos peca de exceso de figurantes en escena.En resumen, un dvd que se deja ver muy bien para los amantes de la ópera barroca, con sus carencias (las menos) y sus virtudes (las más)."
3,very sheer,"this gown is so very sheer almost transparent. i was hoping i would wear it around the house but i can't do that, i might as well walk naked instead. anyways i was desapointed of the quality of the fabric."
2,too flimsy,"The fabric is too flimsy, you can see right through the gown. Perhaps someone would want that in a gown, I did not. Not worth the price."
4,"Pretty, but...","This is a very pretty, soft gown. I don't think it is worth price, though. It is basically a pretty nylon gown."
2,nightgown,"Returned this nightgown because it did not look like the picture. It is shown with a cap sleeve, but it is sleeveless."
1,poopy,"the quality of the fabric is extreamly poor, it hasshoddy stiching. The style looks like something a grandmother would wear with foam curlers and cold cream."
1,Not for you if you want to see actual tornados,"It's all about this guy who mortgaged his house to build this Back to the Future car. Although it was a cool idea, he didn't really get in any tornados and I was looking for more of a documentary on torndaos and storms. This was a disappointment."
3,bogs down,"This film is a predictable pseudo-suspense. The characters are only superficially developed. If you're looking for a diversion, it's ok."
3,Able melodrama,"This is a fine film in many ways. The acting is superb, and so is the camera work. The shots in Wales are stunning. The script is good....until the last fifteen minutes or so. Writer-Director Fellowes simply lacked a believable or even interesting ending. The entire script collapses into soap opera, leaving sensible viewers frustrated. What could have been a magnificent movie turns out to be mere tv network melodrama."
3,"JULIAN FELLOWES, OPUS 1","*** 2005. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, this film is an adaptation of Nigel Balchin'sA way through the wood. A seemingly happy couple's life is turned upside down when Anne hits a cyclist while driving the car of her lover Bill Bule. I personally consider Emily Watson as one of the best actresses of the last twenty years, so I simply had to see SEPARATE LIES. The film is not a masterpiece but is still enjoyable thanks to the actors's performance. And, while watching the film, you can also imagine Italian or Hispanic actors playing the main characters (very funny). Already forgotten."
1,Dreadful,"I rented this and am very glad I didn't buy it. The under 2 hours seemed to take forever to come to an end. The actors are dreadfully unconvincing and have absolutely no chemistry. Their delivery was humdrum and the whole situation was unbelievabe and uninteresting. I didn't care about their feelings how they would end up because there was simply nothing about any of the characters that made me care. The one and only feature that deserves praise is the setting/scenery which was all very beautiful. Otherwise it was an unebelievable ""drama"" about boring people who lacked passion even amidst adultery and a hit and run. I think all the one and two star reviews are right on. Skip this one."
3,Not all that enthusiastic,"I bought this book because it was mentioned in a Thomas Moore book. However, it doesn't come near the level of Thomas Moore's work in terms of insight, originality, or profundity of thought. It is ""lite"" and to give just one indication of this, the original title of the book was something like 'What to do when you're feeling Blue.' Yuk. Nevertheless, here and there, you may find some interesting reflections and suggestions on how to go 'exploring' by using specific methods, spelled out by the author."
3,what's the point again,"Although these seemed like they'd give my toes a nice stretch, they actually kind of hurt my toes/feet. The foam is cheapo which is strange, since they cost more than what they're worth."
2,Toe Flexor,The flexors are not shaped to your foot and I found it difficult to keep them from popping off my toes. They were also blocky and painful. Could not walk in them at all.
2,Invest a bit more and get a pair that are more comfy,"I was very disappointed in these toe separators. They are flimsy, uncomfortable and basically it's better to spread toes without anything than with them."
1,Broke in 3 weeks.,"The install went fine. I had to drill some holes in my shower door (metal) to put the screws through. Three weeks later the bottom threaded piece broke off, and two weeks after that the top piece broke off, and the door handles completely fell off the door. Do not buy these."
5,Review of Scrabblegrams,"This book contains many more Scrabblegrams and for anyone who enjoys this type of Scrabble play the games are excellent. I only hope that they put out a book called ""Another Big Book of Scrabblegrams""!"
1,"More crossword, less Scrabble","Although the product description is accurate, the title Scrabblegrams is very misleading. The book contains simply crossword puzzles that use the Scrabble dictionary as the word source. Its only assist to a Scrabble player is as a vocabulary developer. ""The Official Scrabble Puzzle Book"" by Joe Edley is the ideal book for anyone seeking to develop their skill as a player while developing vocabulary."
3,The Big Book of Scrabblegrams,"The book is okay. Could use some variety in the puzzles. Also, the answer pages contain more than one consecutive puzzle answer so it is easy to mistakenly see an answer for a later puzzle. Other puzzle books scramble the answers non-consecutively to prevent this problem."
1,Don't waste your money....,"This book was disappointing, and the storyline is similar to so many other books. Waste of time and money. Choose something else."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"This was no great movie. After suffering through the first half hour (but determined to see it through), I managed to do my ironing, balance my checkbook, and finish a crossword puzzle while this film droned on (and on, and on) in the background. Even the lovely Katie Holmes couldn't save this movie. I was disappointed, to say the least, after reading all the glowing reviews. The cuts between reality and musical/fanasy were handled much better in ""Chicago."" I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone as it it tedious and horribly uninteresting."
2,"Not the usual Robert Downey, Jr.","I'm a huge Robert Downey, Jr. fan, but this movie did not live up to my expectations. I found it tedious and boring for the most part. I guess every great actor has an occasional bad movie."
3,PSYCHOLOGICAL STUFF,"Robert Downey jr. plays Danny Dark, a writer of pulp fiction novel called ""The Singing Detective."" He is hospitalized with a skin disorder which apparently is psychological. His shrink is played by Mel Gibson, in an unorthodox role for him. Dark's novel is based on events in his childhood, making characters from people he had met. Danny is delusional and imagines things in the present, confounding the people in real life with the characters in his book. The dialogue in the movie is excellent. If you enjoyed the dark humor of the Joker in the Dark Knight, you will enjoy the ramblings of Downey early on. The real problem with the movie is that you realize that all the action in the film is delusional. As far as real action and plot, the film moves along as a one man play. Bad language, simulated sex, no nudity."
1,"Sexist, predictable, profane, boring - I could not watch it.","I thought this might be a fun movie - a cross between the detective genre & a musical, Robert Downey - but was very soon offended by the portrayals of women (all 1-dimensional sex objects stripping in cabarets, boring...), the egregious constant sexual references - for God's sake, don't watch this with children! - and the predictability of the characters. Some boring old-fashioned sexist male idiot's fantasies, I could not watch more than 10 minutes. Too bad Robert Downey allowed himself to be talked into this one.The Singing Detective"
4,Excellent,"Admittedly, I haven't seen the original British miniseries, nor had I even heard of it before renting this movie. If you're in a similar situation, I'd definitely recommend giving this film a shot.Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant in his role as Dan Dark, a mystery novelist hospitalized with a rather nasty skin disease. A bespectacled and bald Mel Gibson, looking for all the world like a senior citizen, is also excellent in a supporting role as Dark's therapist.Overall, a top notch movie that provokes quite a range of emotions."
1,Worst film of Robert's Career.,Robert plays a severe burn patient that is having flashbacks... I think this is one of the worst in his career as it makes him look like a nut that wants to die... Very strong content is involved in terms of sex and violent content.. I expected to see Robert as a detective out solving a case and not some wacked out musical... The only saving grace is the classic music sprinkled throughout the movie...
5,I think I need a helmet after this.,"Hey funboys. Get a room.For all of you who don't know about GILES, get in the know. Before you do make sure you learn the armwrestle. That dance will make her have to change your pants. If you listen to track 3 and don't envision the greatest fight scene of all time your mother must have kept you warm at night by wrapping your head in a blanket soaked in gin and ether. What am I talking about??? What the hell is GILES talking about???? No one knows and no one cares. Just listen...and pass the ether. If you have any Levitra I'll take that too."
1,horrible,"I don't know if I've ever been more happy when an album ended. I will never listen to this again. Avoid at all costs, regardless of how much you love BTBAM, electronic, and/or ""experimental"" music. This is one of the most unoriginal, uninspired, lifeless albums I've ever heard. I would rather listen to Kenny G."
1,industrial + dance = crap,"For an album with only 9 songs, this one seemed to go on FOREVER. I love dance rock, but this s*** is soooooo boring. I wouldn't allow YOU to give ME 12 bucks to take this album, let alone purchase it on my own. Complete and utter crap."
3,lots of common sense,"After reading about this book in a Better Homes & Gardens article, I immediately ordered it from the Empowerment Institute, paying (I'm sad to say) 20 bucks plus shipping. I thought it might provide some innovative ideas on how communities can deal with crime, juvenile problems, and general quality of life issues. And it does have an interesting tip or two.However, most of the information is just basic common sense. Pick up litter, call the police if you see drug dealers, plant a community garden - those are some of the earth-shattering ideas contained within. And they're not even discussed in depth.If you live in a neighborhood that's basically problem-free and you're just looking for some nice neighborly activities, this book is for you. But if your community is struggling with more serious issues, don't waste your time. Do a seach for ""community development"" and choose one of those books instead."
5,Leslie West Rocks,"I can't believe the bad review someone else gave this. Is he listening to the same record? I have never heard a bad mountain-Leslie West album in my 40 years of life. Missisippi Queen is one of the best songs ever.. ever. This live version just proves this. Crossroader is a firey jaunt that could raise the dead. Buy this album and hold on for dear life, then go buy some of his others."
3,Five studio songs and Two Live performances,"Mountain / Flowers of Evil: Half studio and half live, the studio cuts are good without breaking any new ground and the live stuff is enjoyable but unspectacular. This is like two halves of a good idea that don't add up to a whole album."
5,Great Classic Rock,I first heard this album in 1973 and I've loved it since. It's a classic from one of the true fore runners of heavy metal and progresive rock music.
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much from this book. The author's picture on the back seems to be that of an accountant, not of a poet and writer of sensual prose. The book crosscuts back and forth in time and has an eerie, dreamlike texture throughout. If you are a fan of ""Geek Love"" by Katherine Dunn, this book will cover familiar territory, but it covers it well."
1,Major Issues with Kindle Edition,"I have no beef with the translation, but the Kindle edition of this particular book is missing pretty much all of Book XV. If you need this, get the print version off of Amazon -- it's almost as cheap, especially when you consider that they skimmed a little off of the top by removing a chunk of the actual content. It's pretty easy to transfer print to Kindle format, why remove around twenty pages? It's infuriating."
3,Just Fine,"This translation works just fine and is easy to read. My professor found some of translations different from his book, but very much on point."
3,get the Lattimore instead,"Although Mandelbaum's translation of the Divine Comedy is well-done and highly recommended, I don't think too much of his translation of the Odyssey: it reads stiffly and is very dense going.If you're gonna read it, I would recommend the Lattimore translation (0060931957), which reads much more clearly and naturally.This ain't just me: look at the difference in the Amazon reviews."
4,This is the cool knife!,"Arrived on time. sharp enough, cool design, a little bit not balance between 2 blades but not a big deal, this is cool and I still looking for something like this!"
2,headset,well couldnt use the headset cause people said they couldnt here me on it plus made a real loud roaring noice had to get another headset for the phone this is the second phone i have bought of this kind the first one quit working awhile back wont be buying anymore of this type...........
1,Defective,"I had to order this phone twice. The first time the headset jack would not work. The second time, the phone itself would not ring. Finally got tired, and had to ask for a refund. Would have been a great price and unit if it had just worked."
2,not all it says it is,"I was excited to find something this inexpensive in this line of musical instruments. When we got it, we found it played in the key of Bb, and not the key of A. It says A on the brass label, and I'm a music teacher, so I know what I'm doing when I'm looking at keys. The scale was pretty much in tune with itself. But I was disappointed in the product and would recommend for anyone that buy a better brand that will be in the key it says its in."
3,Good Civil War novel... But slow at times,"I enjoyed Cold Mountain. It was a pretty good book. Cold Mountain is about a man named Inman. Sorely wounded and fatally disheartened in the fighting at Petersburg, Inman, a Confederate soldier, decides to walk back to his house by Cold Mountain, to be with Ada, the woman he loved three years earlier. At the same time, Ada is trying to revive her father's neglected farm and learn to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. Many people say this book is like an American Odyssey."
5,Outstanding and beautiful,"I wasn't going to read Cold Mountain--I feared that it would be some nostalgic, racist claptrap like *Gone with the Wind.* But no! Frazier's novel is instead a beautiful tale celebrating life, not war. It is anti-racist, anti-war, and critical of the plantation class-relations helped to foment the Civil War. But mostly, Cold Mountain is a wonderful novel, wrought with beautiful words and an odyssey through a haunted Southern land. How happy I am to have put aside my prejudices and picked up this brilliant work."
3,Not a typical love story,"Cold Mountain...I really enjoyed this novel. It was a beautiful love story between two individuals with nothing but distance separating them. The novel starts out fairly slow, but begins to pick up after the first thirty pages or so. The novel is written from two point of view: Ada and Inman. Inman and Ada had once lived in the same town, but Inman was called off to battle and had to leave Ada behind. When the war ends, Inman makes the treacherous journey back to Ada and along the way he meets a number of interesting characters. Meanwhile, Ada's life is taking her places she neevr thought possible, and her whole life is transformed. This is a fairly quick read, yet not a typical love story"
1,This book is an insult and a waste of time,"I would have stopped reading this long ago if it wasn't for my English class. I can honnestly say that the hours I spent reading this book were hours of my life completely wasted. The charecters, emotions and scenes are underdeveloped and extremely depressing. The way this book is written one would wonder if the author is suicidal, or perhaps he is simply without taste or well developed writing skills. Warning: Cold Mountain should only be attempted with a bottle of prozac."
1,Cold Fish,"I received Cold Mountian as a gift. Boy, am I gland I didn't waste my money on this boring novel."
2,Cold Mountain,"It drug when too many pages were devoted to planting a garden,etc.I nearly gave up and didn`t finish this book.In my opinion the movie was much better because they emphasised more of the Rebele soldier`s being on the run to return to his lover."
3,Just an okay book.,I know this book has been out for a longtime. My coworker said it was one of the best books she's ever read...however not for me. Just okay. Kind of awkward writing at it's best.
3,"An average reading experience, sometimes quite bored","Comparing my after-thought to all other readers' comments, I think this one is just lukewarm not hot boiling. This book actually is very thin, yet I found out that the audio copy was already abridged, that only told me something that some of the keener readers did find it somewhat quizzically bored and impatient during their reading and the question of a better editing requirement did arise often. To judge a book's editing goodness is to check out the page numbers and whether its audio copy is already abridged, no matter what. Because it only means that the narrator had already found it difficult and unbearable to continue reading through or reading along with the whole script if not abridged at some parts(the parts that need to be deleted or omitted prior to official printing). This one, as some of us felt, might indeed need a face-lift editing in its 2nd printing?"
3,Boring,After Inman and Ada are introduced the only issues of interest are whether he will he make it home and whether they will get together. Skip the middle one/third of the book and you have a good Civil War love story
3,Not so thrilled,"Although I thought the book was very well written, I found it to be completely unsatisfying. The ending is ambiguous and if you are an optomist you sometimes need to think about the epilogue. I would not reccommend this book to anyone who is depressed because almost the whole novel is depressing and will probably make your condition worse."
2,A journey to nowhere,"This epic journey by a young man in search of his love during the Civil War era was a poor attempt by Charles Frazier to make this novel into a classic. Instead of telling an adventurous quest filled with exciting action, this novel was confusing at times for many different themes were introduced at inappropriate times in the novel. Even the format of this book was confusing. This novel was split into two parts, a tale of a man and a tale of a woman. I give the author some credit for writing a novel vividly, painting imaginations into the reader's head. However, I disliked the way that he failed to connect the 'two' stories together. This book could have been better if Charles Frazier concentrated more on the actual importance of the journey itself than the useless everyday events that the characters experienced."
2,Boring,Please end...that was all I could think when I was reading this oh so boring book. There were essentially 2 chapters in this book: hungry Inman and I'm not used to working Ada. Your reward at the end of this reading odyssey....melodramatic nonsense.
1,this is what's wrong with best-sellers,"One of the most boring and silly books I have ever read. Kept waiting for something to happen and for the plot to become clear, but it just went on and on and ended in a very disappointing way. The reader never really gets to know the main characters or why they are attracted to one another. This is what is wrong with best-sellers; they're usually bad books with good marketing behind them."
2,"A long, painful, death-march of a read.","This book came highly reccommended by a number of people who were aware of my interest in the Civil War. After reading it, I felt like I had been used as a cannonball at Gettyburg.To be honest, I'm not sure why I finished it, even considering I mostly skipped over the plot dealing with the woman. For long periods it was, quite simply, boring. Inman's trek across a nightmarish South was more engaging, but still lacked any sort of thrust or dip. After a long time of the author's decision to use underscore intead of quotation marks became not just a strange affectation but actively insulting. Yes, we know you're a great new voice, but why try and tart up this fact by using a quotation method that does nothing than call attention to itself?If you're into tear-jerkers, then this book is for you. Otherwise, skip it."
3,This was not a good book to read for school.,I had to read this book for 11th grade english and to read one chapter a night was hard. I did not like how it went back and forth from Ada to Inman. Every other day you got to read what was going on in their world. The book was very drawn out. Except for a the whore scenes. The book was all together a waste of time for a busy teen.
3,cold mountain will help you get your z's,this book was very boring. it had way too many description that lost the story line completely. it had a good story line but it was lost in the descriptions. i would not reccomend this book for any highschool class. kids want to read something more exciting and easier to follow.
2,It is not a good teaching book; should not be taught in clas,"I am a junior and this book was assigned to my class, and I don't like it. I don't think it should be taught to high schoolers because it is very graphic and full of description, which makes it hard to follow."
3,"A little slow at times, but an acceptable school book.","This book is for my summer homework, and the teacher said it would be interesting so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the author describes way too many things and there are too many details and don't really need to be added. But the plot is very interesting and I enjoyed the different elements of the book. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book for fun, but it is a relatively good school book."
2,Book was given the wrong condition description.,Inside was fine. Disappointed as we expected to book cover to be in the very good condition category as it was listed.
4,my Cold Mountain review,"I had to read Cold Mountain for my honors 11 English class. I would have never chosen this book on my own, but by time I got to the end, I really got into it. If I hadn't read it for class, I probably wouldn't have finished it, but I'm glad I did. The descriptions were long, but beautiful, and you have to give yourself time to enjoy it."
4,Pretty good first novel,"Frazier has definitely done his research - the book evokes the period quite well. The story is a little simplistic, but that's the only real complaint."
1,The lame epilogue spoiled the book for me.,"Cold Mountain fell apart at the end. The epilogue was sentimental twaddle, bathed in a ""Waltons"" family glow that didn't match anything Frazier had written up until then. Also, it is not wise to turn minor characters into major ones in the last 3 pages of a 356-page book.Up until the epilogue, I'd been happy enough with Cold Mountain; its slow pace didn't bother me, and Frazier seemed to have a real feeling for his subject. My only pre-epilogue objection was mild: I found myself thinking, as yet another character was cured of disease by an herbal treatment, of the Pauline Kael line about how she personally believed in the efficacy of some herbal treatments, but that she wished just once a movie character treated with them would kick off. (I think she was writing about ""Witness."")"
5,COLD MOUNTAIN is a fresh view of the Civil War in the South,"There is no glory for the South in this love and Civil War story by Charles Frazier. In speaking at a recent book reading, Mr. Frazier said he didn't want to write another Civil War story. He didn't. He has given us a tale of love left behind and a soldier returning home to that love. The love he left embodies both the fauna and flora of Cold Mountain and the girl named Ada. On his long walk home Inman experiences mans inhumanity to man as well as an occasional unexpected gesture of kindness. This is a well written tale of love and war that you will enjoy."
2,Slow Moving,"I wanted to enjoy this book and I forced myself to ""read"" all 540 pages. I put ""read"" in quotations because most of the book was so slow-moving and I found myself skimming half of the pages to get to the real storyline. It would have been more interesing story if it were cut down to 300 pages.If you like to read extremely descriptive storyline, this might be a great book for you. However, if you like your story to move along at a reasonable pace, skip this book."
2,Humph,"I must admit that I began this book with high expectations. I had heard it highly praised. As I read it, I tried to convince myself that I was enjoying it, but in the end, I was glad when I finally turned the last page. I found none of the characters convincing. Ada is probably the worst of the lot. I find it hard to believe that a girl of her background and breeding would have so readily accepted the hardships that she faced. Not that bad behavior should be encouraged, but where were the tantrums? Where were the power struggles between Ada and Ruby? Where were the conflicts within Ada herself? These should have been inevitable. They would have been interesting. I truly feel let down by what I think could have been a very good book."
2,"Very, very slow...","I never give up on a book after I've started it, but this one was tough to stick with. Some readers do love pages and pages of repetitive landscape description, but I actually like for things to happen in a book. I was 200 pages in before I was even interested. I didn't really feel the romance, either. For most of the book, the characters were pretty much unconnected. You would barely think they knew each other. I enjoyed about the last 50 pages or so. I don't discourage anyone not to read it, but be prepared for a long, long trip."
2,The PERFECT cure for Insomnia!,"We just finished reading this book in my Honors English 11 Class and I would just like to say it is probally the most drawn out book I have ever read!! I think if I would read this book ten years from now I would appreciate it, but I think being forced to read it as a teenager ruined it! Every night when I would try to read it I would fall asleep!! And I think the ending is terrible! You go through reading three pages about digging one hole and you read for twelve hours about walking through the woods.....just to get to a disapointing ending!! I dunno, this book is probally good for older people but it is TERRIBLE for teenagers!!!"
1,What's with the critics? Are they out of their minds?,Fraizer MIGHT HAVE done better had he written a cook book on road kill.
4,Depressed All Night,"I am a Southern history and literature buff, so I looked forward to reading this book. It really held my interest from beginning to end. I even began to compare it to Odysses' journey home after the Trojan War. Some of the descriptions were down right poetic! I must say, though, that the ending devastated me. I know we can't expect ""happily ever after"" endings, but the author seemed to be heading in that direction, and that's what I desperately wanted for Inman and Ada, especially after all the trouble they went through. I couldn't sleep after reading the ending. I had to read that part over several times to make myself believe that was the way it ended. An excellent read!"
3,So-so,"This was a good, but not great read. There was some very colorful, discriptive writing but it had a pretty bland story line. The audio was well read but sometimes I couldn't understand some the under-the-breath words. I never did figure out the ending. I'm not sure if that was intentional or if I just had a brain blip and missed some key information. Also, I got somewhat lost on the present/past jumps in the story. I listen to audio books when I am on a long-distance drive so, again, maybe I just missed some key information."
4,Frazier's Inman is historically correct and timeless.,"Brings to mind CCR's great song, ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"", and the bells were ringing... Today the main character in Frazier's novel would be lableed ""PTSD"". That's post traumatic stress disorder for those of you unfamiliar. Inman brilliantly expresses the distress of a disillusioned combat weary survivor. As a Vietnam combat veteran, I was compelled to nod in agreement at the simple yet profound truth Frazier captures when creating the veteran Inman's psychological profile and his sad jaded view of his world and himself, and his struggle to find an endoring hope for peace and happiness at Cold Mountain."
5,Tragic tale that presents a Civil War picture we seldom see,A well-written story of a girl waiting for her man to return from war and the man deserting the Army to return to his girl. Shows part of Civil War era life that isn't normally presented-the hardships and feelings of the people of that time.
2,"Formula writing, fairy tale plot, inconsistent language.","""Cold Mountain"" is formula writing at its most ordinary. The fairy tale journey ... ""and then he met an old woman ....crossed a river ..."" and encountered yet another obstacle provides a predictable and unimaginative plot. A flimsy historical romance, it includes politicallycorrect indigenous American mythology with tokenistic delivery. Unconvincing and poorlyintegrated into the body of the novel, his talesof Swimmer are clumsy and obtuse. His somewhat stilted writing style attempts to convey the language of the period, however it is inconsistent. The up-side is the pace of the novel, which successfully captures the slow pace of daily life and travel at that time. I can't believe what sells well in the USA ... the likes of ""Bridges of Madison ..."" and ""A Thousand Acres"" etc ... are predictable drivel. When will a truly great American writer hit the best seller lists?"
5,Truly one of the greatest novels ever written,An truly exceptional book. Frazier's aw-descripting tales of Inman and Ada are both inspiring as well as beautiful. His vision truly comes to life. An unbelievable first novel by a great novelist. Thank you!
2,I believe it was to drawn out.,This book I feel it was so boring and drawn out that I feel asleep reading it at work. In my opinion it could have been a little less descriptive. If it would have read with a little more action rather then telling about a tree around the other side of the mountain. A few of the passages I did like. The passage I liked was when Inman took the saw and coped the bull into several pieces. If the author would have went into more detail like he did for the one about the cave it would have been a little better. If this story was not for a grade and I had time to really sit down read it. It my have been a little better. So all an all it was an okay novel. Personally I would rather read Stephen King.
3,2 people trying to find each other in a time of lonliness,"Oh my gosh, where do I start? From the begining I really didn't get into the book too much. It was a little slow and somewhat boring. I think that had to do with the reading atmosphere (class). Towards the middle though, I started to enjoy it; reading extra then what was assigned for homework. I liked the detail of Inmans war stories and the way Ada started to become a real working farm girl. In my opinion, though, I think the story would best end with the last chapter instead of the epilogue. Even though I hate when books and movies leave you hanging I think the last chapter would have left you with a better feeling than the epilogue. How depressing! As a last note I found the bear scene extreamily disturbing."
2,Finally Finished,"The friend who loaned me the book said she found it hard to get into until after the 4th chapter. I'm the type to continue to the bitter end. I finished it, but it was slow-going. Was it meant to be that way, a long tedious journey home?"
2,Sloooooooooooooooooooooow,"After reading the rave reviews of Cold Mountain, my book club picked it as our book for August. Oops! The author, of the school that no twig should be left undescribed, slowly leads us through a fairly mundane tale of a soldier's walk home. He runs into a variety of Civil War stereotypes and has several run-ins with the Home Guard, looking to kill him, or put him back on the front lines. Meanwhile, his pampered sweetheart must learn to survive through the tutelage of a knowledgeable stranger. In addition to the pedestrian characters, Frazier refuses to use quotations to identify spoken passages, making the novel at times needlessly obtuse.Had the book been 250 pages instead of 450, it might have been worth the time spent..."
2,Scarlett O'Hara come back!,"Don't waste your time with this book. The author writes reasonably well, and the story has potential, but it fails to evoke much emotion except disgust and depression. This is fiction, supposedly based on oral tradition, that advances the notion that the population of the Old South consisted entirely of drunken, filthy, ignorant men who filled their days with sex and thoughts of the same. The women, almost always good looking, seem only too glad to accomodate these drunken fools. As I read, I continued to hope that Inman would encounter at least one person who was not drunk, deranged, dirty, or disgusting, but it was not to be. By the end of the book, I was only too glad to leave Cold Mountain behind."
2,This book was very boring.,"I feel that this book was very boring and I would not recommend it to any normal teenage girl. I feel that if you have a real life with actual things in the world today why read about the past look forward til tomorrow. ThanxPS my friend Lucky4Zeek@aol.com is like the book, somewhat Amish!!!!!"
2,It's okay.,"I was forced to read this book for a class and here's what I think: some of the descpriptions were a bit much, but others kept you in the story, like you are there with them. The story was good and the ending was unexpected, in a good way. I suggest you read if you like to read for a long time about food and nature. I guess it's okay, but I won't ever read it again."
2,This book is to detailed and takes to much time to read,"This book is very detailed and I did not like it, there are some good parts in the book but i would definetly not recommend it to anyone. The details made no sense at all. i really did not enjoy reading this book"
4,Memorable,"That down-home, backwoods, southern yesteryear jargon is alien to me so the resulting effort to sound authentic is impressive. Events described in understated monotone obviated the numbing effect on war weary characters."
3,"Heard such good press, only to be disappointed","Well written and populated with good characters. But the whole thing should have started about a hundred fifty pages after where it really started. So much of the old preacher just wandering around looking at stuff, other people looking at stuff, people being poor, being grumpy, etc. Once the story finally started, it was good. In fact I really liked it. Makes me wonder if the editors could have made a suggestion or two. I would definitely look for another book by Frazier in the future."
4,Evocative,The use of language in this novel is beautiful and sometimes one has to remind oneself that this is a contemporary author. The characters are not static and Adas personal journey mirrors Inmans physical one. The ending left a little to be desired but a small criticism of an otherwise good book
1,BORING-ZZZZZZZ,"I couldn't get thru this book thus the one star review. This book was BORING. Can't understand what all the fuss is about. I hate the characters in this novel; they do nothing, feel nothing and are not the least bit interesting."
1,Tear the last chapter from the book,"If you are a man, tear the last chapter from the book, and then read it. Write your own ending. Believe me, you'll like it better than the author's."
1,Cold Mountain,"I don't think I'm a hard person to please when it comes to reading material. However, this book is a total drag. I cannot understand why it's a best seller. I'm doing you folks a favor here, heed my words, DULLSVILLE! I wish somebody had told me before I read it."
3,"Beautifully written, but....","I have to admit, giving this book a 5 is tough, because I can't deny the power of Frazier's prose. He's a truly gifted writer. But despite his skill, I just don't feel like I know or can sympathize with Inman and Ada (especially Inman). The recreation of the place and period was superb, and the descriptions at times overwhelmingly good, but in the end I felt it was much less than the sum of those parts. As a comparison, I felt genuinely attached to the main characters of Snow Falling on Cedars (a similarly acclaimed and successful, and beautifully written, novel), cared about the decisions they made, whether they lived or died, etc. Not sure why that didn't happen here, but it definitely didn't."
3,What other books about this time and place?,"Having read ""Killer Angels"" and ""Gods and Generals"", I was interested to read about the Civil War from another viewpoint. Not knowing enough about the history of this area, I found myself wondering whether this book was accurate. By the way, a note to all authors --DO NOT USE A specific plant name if you have not researched whether or not it existed at that time and place. Golden Delicious apples (page 47) were named in the West Virginia area in the 1880's. It would be difficult to have an old tree with that name in the 1860's."
4,darkness,"This book is a great story, but is dark. I couldn't put it down, as I wanted to read that something good was going to happen."
2,Hate the Ending,"After spending ALL that time on this book, I expected more from the ending. It wrote like a love story (a mans version of a love story). I simply believe that a female author would not let you go through all that torture, only to be let down dramatically. Don't bother to read, maybe the book of tape might suit someone better, then you can sleep through most of it."
3,You can't have everything,"I can't help noticing that many people who were disappointed with this book had high expectations which were not met. I had never heard of this book before I picked it up. But this would have been a great short story, if only the 1001 one ways to cook pork had been left out. I also disagree that this book is too similar to Bridges of Madison County (which I despised) or any other such trash. The book was sublime, sometimes ridiculous, but it worked. In fact, it seemed like a cross between the best of Zora Neale Hurston and Robert Penn Warren, not Faulkner. It's a good Southern book which may simply not translate out of the region. The shortcoming with this book? It was poorly edited. And people who didn't like the ending were probably hoping that the Titanic didn't sink in the horrific movie of that name."
2,"Too detailed, protracted and far-fetched","Cold Mountain purports to be an American ""Odyssey"", but the amount of detail is overwhelming and the story line is too thin. It seems as though the author tried to incorporate every esoteric bit of research he could about the Civil War period into this novel. No glossary or supporting notes are provided to help understand the antiquated words and aspects of life in the 1860's. And the main character, Inman, apart from a thinly veiled name that describes his personality, appears throughout the book as a non-entity - just a faceless man trudging home to the girl he loves! If you love American history you might like this, but I prefer a book with more adventure and plot such as ""The Quincunx"" by Charles Palliser."
4,"Well worth the reading, even factoring in the hype.","Apparently I missed all the hype about Cold Mountain. It just seemed like a good read; it was excellent. The author clearly wrote what he knew, and the result is a transporting novel that brought to life the ravages of the Civil War. He wrote with a beautiful eye for detail, the poetic phrase, and a subtlety rarely seen today. I especially appreciated the author's refusal to put a 20th century gloss on last century's events and his using understatement to phenomenal effect. I highly recommend this book."
2,I guess UofM did not prepare me for fine lit,This book is slow and boring. The characters are not interesting and the story is slow. I wouldn't have finished it if I wouldn't have started skimming.
2,get to the point,"I watched this novel spend weeks and weeks on the best seller list and thought that this had to be an amazing story. Granted, the symbolism was extraordinary. However, i thought there was too much of it. If it wasn't for all the sex this would end up being one of the dry ""literature"" that high school students are forced to read in school and the very reason why they don't like literature. All in all, I was very disappointed in this book. I spent a lot of time reading it and hurried to do so only so that i could finish it and move onto a more enlightening novel. Waste of my valuable time....."
2,I want to read the book that all these awestruck folks did..,"but I've got to add another drop to the puddle of people who disliked Cold Mountain. It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed by a book that should have been good. A few very prettily turned phrases here and there, but it wasn't much more than a macho romance novel. I can't say enough negative things about the ending (vapid, trite, insipid....the list goes on and on). I get angry every time I think about it (even a month after I read this thing). I heartily agree with the reviewer who described it as the literary equivalent of ""Dances With Wolves"" - interesting in places, but not worth all the hype."
3,It was OK...,"I ended up liking this book well enough. (I had my doubts around page 100 or so). The descriptive passages are beautifully written. For me, that is not enough to make a great book.The characters and the storyline were dull. Contrary to the opinions of the book critics, Cold Mountain was just another average read."
1,449 Pages of Nothing,"I particularly did not like this book. Nothing happened! All the characters did was walk and work for 400 pages, nothing else. In my opinion, it was a very typical love story. It has a slow begining, a slow middle, and a not-worth-it ending. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they had insomnia."
3,Gripping Read...Yet Disappointing & Ultimately Unrealistic,"Again, I chose to read a novel that I had heard for years was wonderful. Plus, it won an award. The writing style was fine, descriptions were excellent, pace was good, characters well-developed, and I was kept up late at night reading it...but ultimately I was left feeling cheated. The ending read like a movie, and there was too too much unrealistic and unbalanced evil, and the love story seemed a bit too sappy in relation to the other events in the book. It just wasn't believable to me."
2,When does this novel begin to pick up?,"Although I enjoy adventure novels, Cold Mountain was not one that I would suggest for the avid adventure readers out there. It seemed as though the story did not start to pick up until the fifth or sixth chapter. Even though there were spurts of predictable excitement here and there, the first two-hundred pages of the novel had me frustrated and curious as to ""when will this novel begin to pick up?"".It took much vigor to get into the novel and I feel that only the patient type could really get much out of this slow adventure."
3,something painful is often worth the time,"wow. For a book of such concentrated thought, meaning and goodness, Cold Mountain is a little long. I don't think it needed to be four hundred and some pages. about half that would do. The book isn't tortureous. It can be pretty enjoyable. The book is a lot of good parts floating around in a bunch of words. The books ending catches a lot of flack.I didn't like it either, at first, but I guess it is what the author intended, and, I suppose, the best. Read it yourself. See what you think. It'll be worth your time."
1,this book is over-hyped,"I bought this book with great expectations. Was I sorely disappointed! I was forewarned that it started out slow but eventually would pick up. I was down to the last 10 pages and I was still waiting for it to ""pick up."" Granted the writing is very well done, the message is good, but I never got into the book. I felt like I was reading an updated version of the Canterbury Tales. Every chapter about Inman was about the people he met on his journey. The chapters about Ada were a chore to get through because they were so boring. And the end was just out of the blue. It was way too sentimental and sappy. I do not recommend this book to people unless they are English majors who can appreciate the prose."
2,Painful,"I read this book on the recommendation of several people whose opinion I greatly respect. However, I found it to be painful and very slow-going. Frazier seems caught up in gory descriptions of wounds and general civil war gore, rather than quiet yet meaningful relationships. His writing style of using dashes instead of quotation marks to indicate speech made conversations drone on in a lifeless way. It was painful to read this book."
5,"A great story, better heard than read","I bought the book, started to read it, and bogged down in Ada's immobilizing self-pity. Elegant langauge, well-used; just, couldn't get past the mire she was in. I travel about 36,000 miles a year by car here in Montana, and so listen to audio books on an addictive basis. Not wanting to give up on this book, I bought the unabridged, audio version. Absolutely brillant book. I still love these two people, and can see his trip vividly even now as I write this...By the way, Frazier reads his book, with a voice that enriches the story immeasurably!"
1,Not on the bandwagon,"I may be the only one in the universe to feel this way, especially considering Hollywood is making a movie, but I am shocked this book has received so much critical acclaim. Purchased for the very reason the movie is being made, awards, I clawed my way through every boring page, if only to say I finished it. The biggest tragedy of this novel was after dragging myself through the dreary, overly romanticized landscape, the characters do not even get a happy ending. Rather, they get a this-is-real-life dramatic ending designed to impress you with the authors grasp of reality.Needless to restate, I was not impressed and will not go see the movie."
3,Cold Mountain,"Inescapably significant, undeniably influential, and definitely intelligent, this book still has qualities that just...bug me.To start with, I, personally, didn't like that Inman's a deserter. I'd rather read about someone who kept his word and did his duty.The book seems to me over-intellectualized and wordy, and the nasty-twist ending a bit too cruel. Mentalities sometimes seem questionably period.But it's not a bad book. Descriptions, particularly descriptions of music (which few writers can pull off), are strong. Frazier knows how to use the English language, and though sometimes I think he overdoes it, sometimes his prose is beautiful. One does become drawn into the story, and come to care about the outcome. I'll be curious to see what the upcoming movie does, for good or ill."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"There are some parts of ""Cold Mountain"" which are beautifully written, but beautiful writing just cannot compensate for a lame plot (it's modeled on Homer's ""The Odyssey"") and stereotypical, lame characters: a sensitive poetic stud in love with an independent and strong-willed southern beauty. Halfway through I did not see the point in continuing, and I just stopped reading."
4,The Best Oral Reader for an Audio Book,"I have listened to 13 Moons read by an experienced actor and to Cold Mountain, read by the author himself. There is simply no comparison! The author is not likely to be the best person to record his voice reading his or her own book. I found Frazier's voice to be monotone. I love the way he writes, but not the way he sounds. Maybe he figured it out for himself as he did not read the recording of 13 Moons. Both books are excellent. If high school students were to read his books for required work, they would surely learn more history of the earlier periods of America than they ever get from their textbooks. And they would learn it in ways that they would never forget."
3,Bloody but bloodless,"Frazier's prose immediately engaged me in his setting, but never in his two main characters. As others have noted, Inman and Ada seemed oddly detatched from that richly evoked time and place - and from each other - a flaw that detracted from my enjoyment of this otherwise worthy read. I am a tolerant, forgiving reader, but the overly-literary ambigous ending irritated me, particularly since I never had the chance to be convinced of the great transcendent love Inman and Ada supposedly shared. I can imagine that Law and Kidman, two brilliant but bloodless actors, do nothing to improve this flaw in the film. That being said, it is an engaging, textured read, with some marvelously drawn secondary characters (particularly Ruby and her father)."
4,Cheated,"As someone else wrote, I've never felt this way about a book before. If you haven't read the book, don't read this review.I resolved several years ago to walk through life, not run. Cold Mountain is for the walkers of life. In that respect, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Its evocative power was gravitational. No matter how fast my life might have been moving at the time, its overcast style and languid pace was molasses for my mind, catching me, forcing me to slow down to experience the journey.People have complained Inman was one-dimensional. In a sense he was, but only because his existence had been pared down to its most basic form. ""He had seen the metal face of the age,"" and had been stripped to his spiritual essentials. Little was driving him but his will to survive, to overcome. And it was with the characters that I became most enamored. I share with all of them a deep"
3,Interesting Journey,"I enjoyed reading this book. I did not find it boring, nor did I find it to be a great masterpiece in literature. I found it to be interesting and I thought the characters were memorable. The main character is a hero of sorts trying to get home and along the way he meets up with many people who have been affected by the Civil War. The book often keeps you reading due to the suspense of a band of guards from the southern army looking for deserters. I liked this book. I would recommend it."
4,I thought it was OK,"I am a 13 year old who read this book for a school project. I was looking forward to reading it because I heard so much about it through not only my teacher but through many newspaper articles, but when I started the book I found that I enjoyed the parts about Ada better than Inman. I just have to say that this book WAS NOT what I expected. I didn't really enjoy it. But that might be because I didn't understand what was going on. If I were on the National Book Award comitee I would have a hard time finding this as the Award Winner."
4,Not quite as good as expected,"After reading the review in USA Today, I guess I expected a little too much. While greatly impressed with with the lyrical style of writing, I found the early and middle parts of the story quite slow. The book was obviously well researched, and the reader certainly got a strong feeling for the difficulties of the times. The characters were beautifully developed and quite believable in spite of the harshness of many. Nevertheless, while good, I did not see that as a great novel. Towards, the end, I found myself more engrossed, but through most of the book, while enjoying it, I didn't feel distressed to put it down."
4,The march to heaven or hell,"Inman is a character that is already dead even before he starts his long journey home. His body is wasted away by the ravages of his injury. His spirit has seen the long lines of youthful dead upon the fields of this country. His journey is to find his place in the afterlife. He meets those other dead souls along the path to eternity. Each represents a type of person we encounter in our own lives. The final chapter is not the end of his life, that's already over, but the begining of his afterlife."
2,A walk into oblivion,"Although the author tried to paint a picture of these charactors, They weren't anybody I would like to meet or know. I found this very difficult to read and I was happy to be done with it."
2,Cold Mountain left me cold,"After all the hype I was very disappointed. While well written, the characters evoked no emotions from me and much of the story seemed disconnected. Although interesting from an historical standpoint, at times I wondered why the author felt I needed to know what he was telling me. I think this is one book that will make a better movie."
1,cold mountain,"I thought it would be an interesting book to read, however I was wrong. This author needs to learn how to write sentences. His story telling leaves a lot to be desired. The sentence structure is long winded and is unecessary. Get to the point!"
3,Life sucks and then you die - thanks for reminding me,"Excellent descriptions of man's inhumanity to man and women's humanity to women. Ada and Ruby were much more interesting characters than Inman I thought. I'm not going to dog the ending, but I will say it didn't leave me crying. I hadn't developed enough sympathy for Inman throughout the book to ""feel"" for his death.Two things that really bothered me: 1) the time-span regarding the ice-cream making was completely impractical; I remember cranking those old ice-cream machines - 2) there was a watermark or typographical error in my copy of the book that kept reappearing every few pages and was very irritating to read around. (I'm sorry if these objections seem trite.)Basically, I felt about this book much as I did about the academy award winning movie Leaving Las Vegas. Great acting, cool photography - but isn't there supposed to be a story somewhere?"
3,I don't think so...,"Wow. So everyone but me thinks this is a masterpiece. I thought it was elegantly written but boring. I give the guy a six (why is it everyone is either a ""10"" or a ""2""?) because it's his first novel and it seems he's pleased a huge number of people. He can write but in his next novel he needs to pay attention to the story and make something happen. Not bad for a first book and I give him credit for trying to rise above the silly commercial novels (See: ""The Alienist"") that are so prevalent today. Give it a try, read it---but definitely get it from the library! (Sorry, Amazon.com)"
4,Should be on reading lists with Hemingway,"Once I became accustomed to the style of writing Frazier used, I was truly captivated by this novel. The style of writing actually made it a lot easier to read and the descriptions of the characters were so specific. I agree with a review from Europe that it seemed far-fetched that Inman would survive so many catastrophes. I was especially upset with the ending, because it seemed that a person who survived everything up and until the end shouldn't have ended up the way he did. I was expecting a much more breathtaking ending. In any event, I expect this novel to be on educational reading lists with Hemingway and Shakespeare in the near future."
3,A long walk for a Moses tale,"It seems that the book goes on forever, lots of little sories joined together- some more interesting than others. Youneed the time and patience to read it all. I understand why so many people put it down for awhle at least once during their reading. Good if you have the time, patience and inclination."
2,Expectations not met,"I expected more from this book. With all the accolades it received, I was expecting a great read, one that I couldn't put down. What I got was just an okay book. The book is overly wordy and too detailed. The detail definitely got tedious. The story was nothing great.I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Slow and very tiring,I found this book to be very slow at best. I was always waiting for something interesting to happen but it never did. I got bored with Inman and tired of Ada's struggles. Thank goodness I borrowed this book & did not buy it.
3,stunned by the ending,"There is a lot of quality here, and although I found some portions of this book dragging, I never felt a desire to abandon it. Then I read the final chapter. I have NEVER been so disgusted. I felt I had been cheated out of a satisfying resolution to a story that was not an easy read - those of us who stuck with the story deserved better than the cop-out ending we were given."
1,Cold Mountain? More like Cold Molehill.,"I loathed this book. Although Frazier walks the reader through a detailed landscape, nothing can help his plodding prose. I was disgusted with chapter after chapter of ""Inman had a thought...it was this:"". The book begins with a trite, English Patient-esque literary flourish and never improves. Frazier's female ""protagonist"" was a sniveler and the numerous one-dimensional characters that Inman meets on his ridiculous walk home never surprise the reader and border on humorous with their cliched symbolism. In his novel Outer Dark, Cormac McCarthy flawlessly achieves what Frazier clumsily attempts in Cold Mountain. I challenge anyone to read Outer Dark and decide for him/herself. I am baffled that Frazier collected the National Book Award for Cold Molehill."
2,Chick Magnet,"Cold Mountain is The Bridges of Madison County meets the Odyssey with a little Gone With The Wind and Fried Green Tomatoes thrown in. It's another one of those ""she only has to sleep with the guy once"" books that follows in the foot steps of The Horse Whisperer. While I was reading this book on a plane trip no less than four women came up to me and each one not only wanted to discuss the book but gave me lists of some of their other personal favorites. The stewardess even interrupted her beverage service for twenty minutes to discuss this book with me. I must have had ""sensitive guy"" written on my forehead. The writing isn't bad but some of the narrative needs a good disimpaction. The whole Ruby/Ada thing is also a bit kinky. Just what are they doing when they're not in the field picking produce? You don't need a doctorate in comp lit to pick up the message when Ruby beheads the rooster that pecked at Ada's leg. Maybe I just didn't get it."
2,"Not ""Killer Angels.""","Not a bad book - it just wasn't ""Killer Angels,"" nor was it at all similar. No Civil War history. A disapointment to me. To it's credit - it did appear to capture the period though and the struggle for civilians."
2,I'm on the same side of the fence as Renoir below,"I felt exactly the same disappointment that Renoir in her below review felt in reading this book. To be sure, there was some lyric writing, but most of it was buried under piles of boring plot line and sloppy writing. Maybe if you've never read a great piece of literature before you'd be confused into thinking that it's a modern day Odyssey, but my advice to all but the most hard core devotees of slow moving books is to pick up the Odyssey instead. About half way through this book, I realized that I didn't care whether the main character made it home or not. I love Southern writing (like Faulkner, for example), but there are many masters who do a much better job than Frazier."
1,"If Barbara Cartland had written ""The Painted Bird""","You get to wishing that some aggressive infection had killed Inman in the hospital and spared you this read. Most first time authors burn this kind of thing and move on, learning from the mistakes. The fact that this slight, tedious romance novel wins awards is a testament to how terrible writing has become these days. I can't wait to not see the movie."
2,I read this a year ago.....,"and I can't remember a thing about it. I have a dim recollection that it contained two very boring characters that Hollywood would probably have played by Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and that it seemed a lot like a romance novel in disguise.I picked it up because I loved Ken Burns Civil War and books like Lonesome Dove and I thought as I began that it was a little bit of a combination of these, but as I went on I kept visualizing a picture of Fabio appearing on the cover."
2,Like finding a roach at the end of a great meal !,"Charles Frazier's ""Cold Mountain"" has great imagery,spellbinding stories, beautiful metaphors and delightful chatacters. However I can NOT recommend it as a good read. It is like eating a great meal at a fine restaurant and finding a roach in the dessert (last chapter). I read for pleasure, not for a Alfred Hitchcock shock ending. I challenge Frazier to rewrite the ending and place it ONLINE so I can change the 2 stars to 5 plus."
2,Depressing book,"Interesting style of writing but the story is too episodic and formulaic. The chapters alternate back and forth between Inman and Ada, which isn't the worst thing in the world but it does get wearyingly predictable. This happens to him. That happens to her. This happens to him. That happens to her. And so on. The ending is depressing and need not have been. I disagree with comments about this was the only ending possible. I don't want to give it away for those who haven't read it, but the ending brings it down at least one star."
3,3 stars for Cold Mountain,"Cold Mountain is a very slow book in the beginning. As you get farther into it, it gets faster and has more dialouge. There are very few people that talk throughout the book which makes it seem a lot longer than it actually is. I really didn't like the ending all that much because there were so many other chances that it could have happened and it didn't so you wouldn't think that it would ever happen, but it does."
4,Every Life a New Story,"The beauty of Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain goes beyond the basic narrative of the soldier walking back to his home and the troubles of the woman he loved who is now engaged in a struggle of her own. Both these characters are wonderful but the real joy is found in the stories told by all the people they encounter. Each person has a story and each time people meet they, along with the reader, have the opportunity to learn something. The stories are all fascinating, some horrifying and most touching. They are spun together nicely. It is to the author's credit, as well, that interest in the two main characters does not diminish throughout the book, particulary the character of the powerfully written Ada. A wonderful way of looking at America in the Civil War period from many different perspectives."
3,Cold Mountain's characters lack developement,"I just finished Cold Mountain. It was ok, but no masterpiece. It was no Lonesome Dove. It lacks the character developement and any element of change in character(s) to even make much of a comparison. Inman was already changed in the beginning and there are only snippets of him before the war as a younger man. Ada's change is described but her role, necessary as it is, remained tedious reading throughout the book, with occasional flashes of interest. I skimmed the chapters focusing on her. It was not a waste of time though. Overall an enjoyable read."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I've read some bad books in my time, and this beats them all out. This book was long drawn out and boring. The useless details went on forever, and still provided a hazy picture. If you have to read it for school, get the Spark Notes."
4,The ending is unforgettable,"I have to admit reading this book was somewhat tedious at times with all of the descriptive text. But after a few chapters, the way Frazier cleverly alternates the tale of these two lovers leads to a worthwhile read. Fascinating characters flow in and out of the traveler's journeys. The slow detailed pace only makes the rapid and intense surprising conclusion unforgettable. I am happy to hear that they have just agreed to make the book into a movie."
5,A modern Odyssey,"I thouroughly enjoyed this unabbrideged reading of his own novel by the author himself -- 12 CD's that I listened to over six days of my vacation at the seashore when it was too beastly hot to do anything but sit in the shade and immerse oneself in good writing. It was like living with the two main characters and the host of interesting, often unsavory, treacherous, sometimes cruelly violent persons that Inman encounters along the way during his long struggle to get home to his betrothed. The author's use of anecdote and flashbacks and his switching back and forth between two separated lovers keeps the listener alert. His own flawless reading in a pleasing, soft, southern voice makes the following of this long picaresque narrative a pleasure to listen to. Unlike Homer's Odyssey, the outcome is tinged with diaappointing sadness, but salved by hope."
4,An enjoyable Journey,"Despite the sad ending, reading this book was an enjoyable journey.I read the book before I saw the movie, and I liked both."
5,Lyrical and moving Epic,"Cold Mountain is a magnificent tale. It approaches the Civil War in a way that makes one understand the impact on individual lives, and avoids the usual historical lessons of the national politics. This is a book for serious readers who can appreciate a book that explores the human condition without all the sensationalitic hoopla that marks a lot of modern fiction. This is literature, not the usual best seller drivel. Obviously some of the people who have written reviews need to stick with Grisham or Koontz. Cold Mountain is for the discerning and discriminating reader."
1,details in search of a good story.,"I can't understand how this very tedious piece of junk ever made it to anyones' best seller list. The author obvoiusly studied the flora of the region, but there is no interesting ending to this thing. It just sort of stops and does so with an unlikely bit of forced plotting. What a waste of time."
1,I've never been so bored as I was reading this book!,"When I first started to read this book it was extremely boring, I continued reading it hoping it would gradually get better. I was terribly wrong, I could not get into the book what so ever. In the middle of the book I was extremely dissapointed. If we didn't have to read it for school I would have burned it after the first chapter. The ending was a suprise though. I have never been so happy to end a book, as I was when I finished this one. This is a very good bedtime story but warning to all readers, not only will the person your reading to fall asleep but so will you!"
1,Where are the quotation marks?,"The lack of quotation marks to indicate dialogue made this a very difficult read. Is the lack of quotation marks a current writing trend? I hope not! Additionally, see p. 188 about the 6th paragraph down, ""His beaver hat and a bright throat scarf."" Is this a new form of sentence structure?! hope not! This book won awards??!!"
2,It was AGONY getting through this book. . .,"I really hate to give the book a 3 but the well crafted paragraph sentences did not compensate for the tedium of this story. There was not enough character development but having struggled to the end I felt very gipped by the ending. I did have a positive outlook when I started, especially aftering having seen a Sunday CBS This Morning segment about the location. A well written book and an extreme disappointment."
1,An over-hyped book,"After reading all the great reviews of this book and its author I was looking forward to reading this author's first novel. I was rather disappointed. The story is poor and says much to do about nothing. I was at times wondering what the author was trying to say about Iman's journey or experiences. I really feel as if the author should have included a description of him prior to his experiences in the war, so the reader could have have a better idea where he was coming from. I did find Ada's saga more interesting, but a spoiled girl being forced to grow up in harsh times is not unique and I did not find myself that interested in her evolution either. The love story between the two characters was also poorly described and the ending was as predictable as it gets. All in all this was one book and author I was disappointed with and doublt I will read his next book."
1,Dark and Obvious Piece of Junk Disguised as Literature,"This book is a cliched piece of garbage and the author should be drawn and quartered. Not only is it unrelenting in its depravity, it passes itself off as a romance. Most women I know would be instantly turned off by the vulgar and disgusting details in this work. DO NOT BUY IT. If this saves one person $20, good. Give the money to a charity instead. Sometimes it isn't better to go and read a book."
1,"No action. What kind of war book is this, no gore.","Maybe I don't understand very moving literature, but I've read more exciting books than this, and yes we were assigned to read this book in a high school english class. The point on reading a book that took place in a Civil War period, is the behind the scenes of the war, hell. Gone with the Wind was even better than this. At least they told a good story about the life in the Confederacy. This story told more of farming, survival, and some sex ( don't get me wrong, I loved the slut scene) but slow never the less. If any one who would want to buy, or borrow this book. You must have a lot of time on your hands, because this book is not what you call a Civil war story."
3,Leaves me cold,"This award-winning, acclaimed book was, well, BORING. At least to me. While there are some wonderfully descriptive moments and some great relationships (Ada and Ruby, Ruby and her father) overall, it was just a bit of a chore to read.The 'heartbreaking' ending I saw coming a mile away and somehow during this book I never really connected to Ada and Inman's relationship. I don't think enough time was spent on why they were together and why they cared for each other. I guess I wasn't heartbroken by the ending because I really didn't care about them as a couple.And I hated the bear incident. It was unnecessary and upsetting.I wanted to like this book. I love historical fiction and I think the author had a great idea. I just think it missed in the execution. Maybe others really loved this, but for me, it wasn't worth my time."
5,buy a dictionary with it,"I loved this book. I loved the story, loved the images, just *loved* this book. I also learned these new words: harl, malander, cullions, sputcheon. I took to keeping a dictionary next to me as I read. This is less onerous that it may sound."
4,Cold Mountain and O Brother Where Art Thou!,"Cold Mountain is a wonderful book historically speaking. It describes the emotional feelings and views about the Civil War among the Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina natives very accurately. It also accurately details the bushwhackers and outlaws that roamed the mountains, stealing and killing at will. However, I connected the book almost at the beginning with another O Brother Where Art Thou! Although the roamings of Inman are interesting, the similarities are so there between these two that it takes something from the book."
5,New Shoes,"Cold Mountain reaches a new, profound level of storytelling. In its simple, honest storytelling, it captures the very essence of the southern culture, as well has human behavior every step of the way.Walking around in the shoes of the main characters, Inman and Ada, readers find themselves talking to the characters of the book, and also the feelings, moral values, and values of Inman and Ada.The images drawn are so carefully detailed and vivid that at times the reader may feel as if they for a brief moment was living the characters lives, whether it be sleeping on the damp forest ground, meeting a lover, and the desparation of following a fading trail.All in all a great read, and a compelling adventure which truely exemplifies the art of storytelling, to preserve a life."
5,Cold Mountains words warms the heart,"We are inundated each day with written word and visual images. Our training is to tune out the tedium, the image of more than 6 words, the subject which demands attention. Then there is Cold Mountain. The adventure is the means to Fraziers written word, to his colors, his feelings. They wrap you up and draw you slowly and constantly to the next vision. This book could have been 1000 pages - I found it each evening at my bedside and reveled in the telling of the tale."
4,Not great but still good,"Too much hype and praise for this book led me to believe that it would be the best book I ever read. While Frazier's descriptions and language vividly painted strong mental images I found the storyline to be slow in starting. Parts of the book dragged. It reminded me in part of Thomas Hardy's writing style. All in all, I thought it was a good book but I was expecting a GREAT book. Even though I wasn't totally capitivated by Cold Mountain I still look forward to Frazier's next book."
4,"Good Book, Beautiful Cover","I think Disney has a similar story about a dog ... nevertheless, ""Cold Mountain"" was a pleasant reading experience. The main characters were well developed and the writing was refreshing. My only complaint was the ending ... oh, by the way, the ending of the Disney story was better."
3,Sometimes I scratch my head over what books win awards,"This author writes beautifully, and the book has a very interesting structure, moving back & forth between the two main subplots. But there is a problem or two. First, the structure is obvious as an intellectual construct (something like watching a simpleminded movie in which you know the entire plot line in the first 5 minutes). Second, it is pretty tough to care about the characters, since you can see these stick figures moving through the author's imagination toward some end beforehand. This is not a bad book, it just doesn't seem deserving of the National Book Award to me."
2,not worth it,"a mediocre novel that i would not recommend. i kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
2,Don't Be Sucked In by the Hype for This Downer,"The winner of the National Book Award for fiction, Cold Mountain left me cold. If the story were set to music, it would be nothing more than a percussive ""trudge, trudge, trudge"" with an occasional banjo and broken violin dragging along. Upon reading the reviews and the initial chapters, Frazier's story of an outlier (deserter) during the Civil War evokes vivid images of pain, suffering, hardship, filth, and all the other accoutrements of battle. The long walk home to his conjured-up sweetheart, a girl he barely knew before trudging off to enlist, is more interesting than the actual reunion. The story is told from the soldier's experiences and then from those of the ""sweetheart"". Both suffer, both change in appearance and ideals. It was a terrible time, of course, and Mr. Frazier's award-winning downer employs Murphy's Law to its full extent ."
4,Needed Better Editing,"It's a classic theme of a pilgrim traversing a shattered world. Witches, but not as fanciful as ""Brother Where Aret Thou?"" and none of the humor of ""Gravity's Rainbow."" Most off the writing is very solid with some excellent metaphors that will stay with you. My biggest gripe is that a couple lines get repeated which clearly should have been edited out.Although Inman is starving, there is a scene where he kills a very bad man in the bad guy's smoke house, then leaves. A smokehouse was literally like a bank, and there is no way to explain Inman failing to take several hams with him."
3,Cold Mountain - Miles of torture,"I had to read this book for my Honors English 11 class, and it was pages and pages of torture. It was probably more torturous due to the fact that i was reading it in school, but i wouldn't have read it out of school. Expect pages and pages of the most vivid descriptions of nature and civil war, i think the author could fill a chapter describing some dirt under his chair. The writing is so dense that it takes three times longer than usual to read one page. I'm giving it three stars simply because i'm amazed at the amount of description the author can cram into one sentence. If you have alot of time to kill, this book will probably do it."
3,Eh,"The novel isn't exactly gripping and it definitely is not a light, easy read. At times I had to force myself to read this. The plot is written from the perspectives of a couple: Inman and Ada. Inman gets fed up with all of the death he is exposed to while fighting in the Civil War and embarks on an odyssey to go home while being wounded in the neck. Ada struggles to care for a large estate of land that she inherits from her father while at the same time becoming increasingly tired of the life she leads. Some of the situations described in the book are powerful and memorable, but truth be told, I finished this book three days ago and already forgot most of it."
1,Unreadable,"This book is not only awful, but it is entirely unreadable. It is purely for pseudo-intellectuals and those who aspire to become one."
1,too slow to start,"I never managed to finish this book,it may be a fine piece of literature,but unfortunately the fineness of this gentlemans writing ,did not hold my attention,for me the beginning was too slow ,yes it was quite detailed but my enthusiasim wained quickly. I was dissappointed that for me ,this book did nothing,after I had read good reviews. My view must not reflect on the quality of the written word by Charles Frazer it just wasnt for me."
5,Captures time and place perfectly,"Inman, a Confederate soldier, is wounded at Petersburg. He becomes disillusioned with the fighting and decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge Mountains and the girl he once loved. Frazier relates Inman's odyssey with great care and precision for time and place. His journey home captures our interest slowly but completely--this is an extremely well-written novel."
5,"Best Book I've read this year, except for A FINE BALANCE","This book was compelling to read (could not put it down), good story, beautiful language, exquisite detail, interesting characters, and brought me face to face with history, both of the country, and my own family history. Having grown up on a farm in the early 50's I still have memories of my grandmother wringing the necks of chickens, canning vegetables and killing hogs. Putting dinner on the table in those days meant a lot more personal investment of effort than now. Thank you, Mr. Frasier for filling out this thread of history in such a believable way. I actually lived in this time and place during my reading of this book, and these characters will never leave me. Ada could have been my great grandmother."
5,Storyteller in spades.,"I am amazed at some of the panning this book has received. With out a doubt this book ranks way up there with the likes of - well, name them all. Mr Frazier shares with us not only vivid snapshots of his 200 year old mountain legacy, he also paints word scapes. Each character is a microcosm of us all. This is the real deal. I havn't read anything as indelible for many years."
5,A beautiful and haunting story.,"This is a quest novel with a twist. Inman, a battered Confederate veteran, walks out of the hospital where he is healing for a return to the front and begins the long trek home to the mountains of North Carolina. Ada, raised in the pampered society of Charleston, is left on her own on a farm in the mountains after her father's death and begins a long journey of learning how to live on her own. Their stories come together in a way that is both compelling and surprising. The power of this story comes not only from its lyricism, but from its willingness to engage the reader in an exploration of themes that are as old as literature. Inman, like Odysseus, wonders not only whether he will ever reach home again but whether his experiences have changed him beyond all recognition. Is his craftiness a means to an end or has it obliterated his ability to open himself up to another person"
1,Guide to writing a bestseller ....,Heres a guide to writing the next bestseller -1. Copy several hundred pages out of a really old trail guide to North Carolina2. Add a few dozen recipes for goat stew3. Don't forget to rip out the last few pages just to make sure that the reader is left feeling cheated and bewildered.
5,A beautiful novel,"This is a book that I didn't want to finish, not because it wasn't good, but because I loved reading it so much. A great narrative. It is beautifully written: eloquent, expressive, powerful, moving. This is a book to own, to keep on your shelf and re-read year after year."
2,"a man, a woman, a bear","The story behind the story is simple and revealed after the first two chapters of the book. It is a story of two people, one man, one woman, as they each journey towards their individual dreams and find peace in themselves by way of self-redemption and self-sacrifice.The man is a soldier who has self-retired after a ""fatal"" bullet and gathers himself as he embarks on his long walk home. On the other side of the mountain, the woman sits alone yearning for help on her farm and wholeness in her life. Each bump in the road for the man is accompanied by a droning parallel of the woman and her farmwork. Will the man make it home and reunite with the woman? Will the woman ever finish her chores? Read this book to find out.Personally, I believe this novel is an admirable attempt to clone a timeless classic, but i fail to recognize the allure and originality of an Odyssey. The senseless brutality and heartless farm scenary contributes to my recognition of this novel as FAIR."
3,Cold Mountain is a fine story by a talented authr.,"I have only recently begun reading novels as a way to reduce job stress and find a way to relax before bed. So, this review may count for nothing. I bought Cold Mountain (CM) because it had gotten great reviews in the local paper ( The Orlando Sentinel) and I had seen an interview on TV of Mr. Frazier where his book was highly touted. I was so hyped to get it, that perhaps my expectations were too high. I really was expecting the newest American Classic. Well, in my opinion, it doesn't reach that level. Now, it is a fine book and it held my attention as I read it over a couple of days. The details of the book are very good as are the characterization, plot and flow. It is a book worth getting from the local library and enjoying during the summer on lazy days. I can certainly recommend it for that. I like Mr. Frazier's effort and will look for more work from him."
4,Great characters; good story; killer ending.,"This is a good read and well constructed story with full main characters. The writing is excellent for a first novel, except that the first few chapters don't flow as well as the rest of the book; they seem overwritten and sluggish. I think this is more the editors' fault than the writer's.The ending will disappoint some, but it is true to the character of the time and the nature of the actors. It is perfect."
3,"Well written, but not the great American novel","I found this novel to be generally well written (some great descriptions) and entertaining -- an impressive first novel. I was surprised, however, to find that it is, essentially, a conventional romance novel. Other than the style of the writing itself, there was little I found remarkable. What many have found most impressive -- namely, the love story between Ada and Inman -- was, to me, the least interesting and least convincing aspect of the whole novel. Additionally, I found Frazier's inclusion of topographical details to be self-indulgent. After all, how many descriptions of an appalachian landscape does the reader really need?Just before reading this novel, I read ""Underworld."" Unfortunately, ""Cold Mountain"" suffers greatly from the comparison. The fact that ""Cold Mountain"" won the National Book Award over ""Underworld"" would seem to reflect more on the merit of the award than it does about the actual quality of this novel."
2,Disappointing. Characters did not come alive for me.,"I am a loner here since most people loved this book. In my book group of 6 women, 2 loved it and four of us disliked it. Found the characters simply flat and not compelling. Thus, we didn't care much how things turned out. One of those who liked it found it a compelling description against war."
2,What's the big deal?,"I struggled to get through this. I found the language cloying, over-blown and annoying, wrapped around a tenuous cast of characters. Also tripped over several editing errors, which were irritating. I find it disheartening that this novel is being heralded as classic literature."
3,Disappointed,"Grew up on the East Coast, studied the Civil War and found this book extremely boring. Do not understand how it could be #1 for so long. It was well written but particcularly boring."
3,Slow moving but gets better toward the end,Quite boring at the start but pace picks up toward the end.
3,"""Why Me""","Great story;Good plot;but hard to read. Through out the entire book you get the picture that a movie was coming. The movie will more than likely sum the whole book up in an hour. The overly descriptive writing style really helps the book flow along. At times when theplot is thick Frazier ruins the moment with a descrtiption of something that nobody wants to know about. Your waiting for the all inmportant line when he lets down with another detail. The ending of a Civil War book is usually predictable but in this case he catches you completely by surprise. He would have had to do somrthing different if he wanted to sell a book. I give a five! Good effort on the part of Charles Frazier, But on the contrary, too hard for a relaxing and enjoyable experience. P.S. only read it for the credit in class! END"
2,Cold Mountain Leaves Reader Cold,"I must give the author two stars for effort, as Frasier is a very eloquent writer, however, I did not enjoy the story in the least bit. I found it a chore to actually sit down and read Cold Mountain, but forced myself to do so because I had paid good money for it. I would definitely avoid this book, unless you want something that will put you to sleep as a result of a lack of any action. Maybe that is why all so many people liked Cold Mountain...it is a good alternative to sleeping pills."
4,"loved it, interesting style","It took about 40 or 50 pages to get used to the writing style of Mr. Frazier. But after that it read very easily. Don't stop because it is different. If you decide to read this book, finish it, you will be in for a real treat. What a story teller. I hope there are more great stories where Cold Mountain came from."
3,Interestingly Depressing.,"I read this book as part of a recreational reading group here on the island of Saipan. Although depressing, the author captivates the reader. Inman was indeed depressing."
3,"5 star writing, but in the end, unsatisfying","Unsatisfied is really the best word I can use to describe the feeling I had at the end of the book. I really enjoyed reading this book right up until the end. The characters are memorable, the visual descriptions wonderful, the style and flow of the writing very engaging. However close to the end I even predicted what the cheesy, over-used ""literary"" ending would be (I hoped against it, but alas, I was correct...). I read the book so I would have a good comparison for the much-anticipated movie, but now I don't think I want to bother with the movie. One let-down is enough."
1,Tear the last chapter from the book,"Tear the last chapter from the book, and then read it. Write your own ending. Believe me, you'll like it better than the author's."
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN!,"This was on my son's 11th grade reading list. It is absolutely full of profanity and the most crude words you've ever heard. There is one scene where a woman is described in vivid detail. If you are considering this for your school age child, please review it yourself first. I wish I had known the content ahead of time.Cold Mountain: A Novel"
3,Great imagery but drawn out,"I can see why people hailed this book as the next ""American classic"" based on the vivid imagery of the old South presented by Frazier.This book was by no means a ""page turner"" and it would be very hard to say ""i couldn't put it down"" like many of the other bestsellers on the market.The only thing this book did for me was to make me realize how great and awesome nature is and how we constantly take it for granted.The romance between Inman and Ada never materialized and their meeting was quite anticlimactic. Perhaps their old, pure style of romance is a bit outdated for today's 30 and below generation of readers.Good effort by Frazier, but if you have other ""to read"" books on your shelf, I would leave this alone."
4,Not as great as some insist,"A book shouldn't have to be read four times before it can be appreciated. ""The Triumph and the Glory"" was stunning the first time around. ""Gates of Fire"" was vividly real the first time around. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was captivating from the first page. I could go on and on. This is a good novel but those of us who consider it dull in spots or tediously over-descriptive of a bunch of plants need not be classified as idiots who don't know good literature when they see it. In my mind this is four star material. The fine novels I mentioned at the top are five star material because they are riveting from the start, graced with characters just as memorable, and don't rhapsodize about leaves and twigs for 180 pages."
4,"A wonderful book, full of haunting images and people.","This book was exceptional. I enjoyed the Lyrical quality of his prose. Frazier puts the reader into the thoughts of the characters with his descriptive narative. I enjoyed being shown rather than being told. One crticism: the characters themselves were better developed than their realtionship. It was as if there romance was woven into the story to justify the importance of following these two lives. Frazier was in no hurry in telling his tale. I do admit, I was at first waiting for something to ""happen"". Then, at about midway, I let myself be taken in with the narrative and enjoyed the day to day doings of Aida and Inman. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys savoring a good book."
2,Boring Narrator,"I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in ""w"" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a ""brilliant"" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life."
1,"Slow, Pointless and boring","Can someone please expain the point of this book? I got 80 pages into the book and realized I had no interest in finishing the book. I could care less what happened to these characters. I heard they are making a movie out of the book and if that is the case, go see the movie if you need a good nap."
1,crap book,"THIS BOOK IS BORING AND CRAP THE PUBLISHER OF THE BOOK CANT SPELL AND THE EDITOR OF THE BOOK CANT EDIT, AND THE AUTHOR CANT WRITE, other than that its a good book"
1,Harlequin romance in Ulysses' clothing,"Okay, the man can write -- every review gives him that -- but the plot is thin, tedious and vapid. Only in America in 1997 could a deserter become a hero -- this thing is PC to the extreme --""war is bad, Indians are noble beings living in harmony with the land"" -- and the soupcon of lesbianism does nothing for the plot or prose. Read carefully this thing is really a womans' book -- a Harlequin romance -- though it is gussied up in some masculine trappings. Despite the groundswell of approval, skip this turkey -- wish I had, and saved my money."
2,Not the worst thing I've ever read...,"While very descriptive, most of the characters seem to have been pulled from a Cracker Jacks box o' stereotypes. I could easily envision the wilderness, the house and so on...but the characters were as real as paper dolls."
4,"Enjoyed it, but with a few complaints","I had the same problem getting into the book that others have mentioned. I put it down after a few pages and then only read it after I had read everything else in the house. Eventually I got into the book and kept awaiting the reunion, skimming the passages about plants (what was that for anyway?...yawn). The fact that the ending was sad did make me snarl a little, feel a little cheated, but my main complaint is Ruby's husband! She was the strongest, most honest person in the book and she ends up marrying a little weasel that leaves her father to die, then lives in Ada's house without permission for days while the two women go searching for dear old dad. I was appalled at her brand-new lack of judgment and offended for Ada that now all these kids of Ruby and her lousy husband ended up living with her. I also think the author could have at least MENTIONED poor Inman in the conclusion. I suffered through a lot of pages with that man and he deserved better!"
4,5 stars until the ending,I know the ending was poetic. I know the ending was foreshadowed. I know the ending was beautifully written. But it was still a lame way to put down a book that I had not been able to put down.
2,Best read on an empty stomach,"If I had to read about what Inman and Ada ate one more time I was going to eat the darn book. Thankfully, the story ended. The author probably couldn't come up with yet one more disgusting discription of roadkill. When Inman ate the bear I burst out laughing. Yes, I know people eat bear but it was just a little farout as to how Inman got the bear in the first place.All that aside, the book is quite boring although I recognize that the author worked very hard on it. He just didn't come through for me."
2,Yawn. Should have been a lot shorter.,"This book was OK. Would be fine for a long, long plane ride. But, they story kind of dragged, and the ending was very ho-hum. At times I thought the writing was very nice and descriptive, but for the most part I slogged through the book cuz I heard it was so good."
5,A literary masterpeice!,"This was the most moving, best written book I have ever read. The descriptions make you feel as though you are taking part in the lives of the characters and the scenary. I was so caught up in the story I could not put the book down. Stirring, beautiful and tragic."
2,Not bad for a first book,"I had to force myself to finish this book. After the beginning, wondering why everyone who sees as much as his shadow wants to kill Inman, the main character, and where he got so much money, I had a hard time taking the rest of the book seriously. There was really no charater development. Each character had maybe one quality that they never strayed from: one weak, one strong, one determined. I can see that this story would make a good movie (but I haven't seen the movie) since it is at least a very visual book. However, I didn't particularly care for the descriptive passages in Cold Mountain. Also, the story line is very simple an predictable."
3,Moderately entertaing work,"I read this book following the massive amount of hype that errupted after its publication. While the book was a moderately entertaining Civil War yarn filled with believable characters, it doesn't deserve all of the praise it received. One glaring reason why is because I correctly guessed half-way through the book how it would end. A truly good novel should keep one guessing. This one didn't."
2,Beautiful writing does not a masterpiece make,"I suppose that, perhaps in the middle of a nasty stretch of bleak winter in solitary confinement, I might be compelled to try reading Cold Mountain again. The description reeks of self-consciousness. I managed to read the first 100 pages, and could stand no more.I *am* from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and it is a stunningly beautiful, sometimes hazily mysterious place. I love it, but I'm spoiled by its lush reality. Frazier obscured the view. I found Ruby far more interesting than either the self-absorbed, despairing Inman or the tiresome Ada.So far as an adventure of the wandering seeker is concerned, The Chess Garden is a much more engaging read."
2,"""The Long Walk"" is better","Why is this book so over-hyped? I cannot see the point. Frazier writes competently, but I find it hard to be enthused about his subjects. Maybe I'm just tired of reading about low-lifers and their disgusting appetites and vices. Call me old fashioned, but I don't see the need to wallow in the mud, even if it is elegantly described mud. If you want a compelling story of a heroic journey that is impossible to put down, read Slavomir Rawicz's ""The Long Journey,"" available in paperback from Amazon.com for less than $11. This is a true story of the author's escape from a Siberian prison camp and his trek to India. It involves no graphic violence, rutting, or even cursing. Long Walk will restore your belief in the basic decency of your fellow human beings. It is also, in contract to Cold Mountain, impossible to put down."
3,I am stunned that so many people praise this book highly.,I am stunned that so many people bought this book. I started it soon after it came out and put it aside after 70 pages. I started over this spring and read the whole thing. It did not move me or reveal much at all about life except that the Civil War has been exhausted as a subject for fiction. I found Ada an especially boring character topped only by the stupidity of Ruby. Nothing about Ada would compel a man like Inman to return to her. He would have been better off dying a hero in battle than an outlier returning to such a miserable weakling as Ada. I fully expect that Charles Frazier will laugh all the way to the bank as he and his agent have put one over on the American public.
1,"I was disappointed in the book, which had been so praised.","Because the book was so highly acclaimed, even by some of my friends, I waited on the list for months to get a chance to read it. How disappointing. I felt that the only explanation of the actions of the characters and the way they were described could be that the narrative was actually of a dream: that a some point, someone would wake up and the real story would unfold. The characters met on the journey were just not real people. I did force myself to read the whole book!"
3,I thought Inman's journey would never end!,"If you like very descriptive writing, Cold Mountain is for you. I enjoyed the character development of both Ada and Ruby. Inman on the other hand ... all I can say is that it was an extremely long and drawn out walk. Some of the characters Inman met along the way were very interesting, but he wasn't."
2,"Good story, sparse writing, graphic violence","This book was short on information and long on words. Oftentimes, I did not know what the author was talking about because of his use of jargon and very little dialogue.The story was good, but the violence was a little too graphic for my taste. A disappointing ending as well."
5,Eloquent and artful!,A masterful description of the hardships during a difficult period in our history.
2,Cold Mountain was... cold,"I had the constant impression as I read this book, that it was always night. This book was extremely dark and depressing. The beginning was interesting but right when it got to Ada I knew I was in for a sleeper. Most of the reviewers said they liked Ada better- in a way I did, I actually knew more about her, but I was thankful when it switched to Inman's side of the story. At least things actually happened. I was very dissapointed by this book. Once again a writer who can write well, but just can't get a story. Overrated. I've been to that area of the US and while Frazier said in his text it was beautiful, he never showed us it was. It was dark, dark, dark! Unless he had a goal of us all buying anti-depressants while reading this, the book was not a sucess. Well, I expected that. Award winning books NEVER are any good."
4,"With poetic writing, gives a new perspective of Civil War","This fabulously written book gives a different perspective of the Civil War and perhaps all war at that. Although it's slow reading, the writing is so poetic and the characters well-drawn (except for Ada in the first chapter) that it's both an emotional and spiritual quest. A must for all Civil War buffs."
4,Don't quit - it's worth your time.,"This book is not for people with short attention spans. It dwells on description and luxuriates in the voice of its period. There is a predictability to the story that only helps to make it more believable. The unexpected turn should be reserved for action movies and the like.Once I got to know the characters and the connection between the leads, I found it a thoroughly enjoyable and, now, memorable read. If you enjoyed ""Lonesome Dove"" and can do with a little less action, this is a book you should try."
5,Life altering-Terrific saga!,"The book was a marvelous journey. Inmann's life has had a real impact on me, and it will take me a long time to get over it. I now view history in a different way...and see the inestimable value of living a down to earth life. So much can be savored in simply existing! I can't even pick up another book until the dust from this one settles in my heart! Thank you Charles Frazier."
3,Inconsistant... rather annoyingly...,"A great story, told lovingly and descriptively... but the language used was horribly inconsistant... the dialogue used did not reflect the period which he was describing, and the relations drawn between modern day descriptions and civil war period scenes was rather strange to experience. i failed to grasp the significance of the number three, and the exhaustive description of birds numbering three was a tad overwhelming after a bit.All and all a good read but for a National Book Prize winner, i had expected A LOT more..."
2,I just couldn't get into it.,"I tried to read this book twice and just couldn't. It didn't hold my interest, my mind kept wandering to things that I could be doing. When I took it back to the library for the second time, I thought I was the only one that felt like that, but our library manager said he had felt the same way. I had really wanted it to be great, because the Cival War times are so interesting to me."
2,waste of my time,"author's use of computer thesauras was a tiresome chore for any reader who clears words. story was just another unrequited love tale ala Forest Gump, Bridges and Braveheart. Book's fans all need to get a love life. a civil war harleguin at best."
2,Draggy,"After all the hype, I eagerly sat down to read this book. I kept thinking it will get going soon. It never did. Dragging on ad nauseum to an ambiguous ending, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"""What if they had a war and no one came"" senario","Cold Mountain is an excellent book for those who have not explored the history of the Civil War (War between the States). However, I found sections of the book leaving me wanting more; more action, more emotion, more something that left me feeling vacant. I did find it interesting how Frazier developed the characters, yet I felt I did more thinking about their strengths and weaknesses than he did. I would recommend this book, but I appreciate the wordship of authors such as Baraba Kingsolver more than Fraizer."
5,Absolutely loved it,"If you enjoy deeply felt intelligent literature, you will likely love this one. If your idea of good reading is of the ""page turner"" variety, you might give it a pass.Charles Frazier's hauntingly beautiful novel is a retelling of a life-changing time in American history and the lives of the residents of Cold Mountain. I have not read anything else that has moved me in such a profound way in recent memory.It is very deserving of all of the accolades that have been expressed and undeserving of the petty criticisms that have been registered here. To those, I would suggest that they try some Grisham or King perhaps and leave the good stuff to the grown-ups."
1,It must be marketing genius.,"Where was the plot? True, the author turns a pretty phrase and gives a vivid description of what life was like during the Civil War. I think he got so caught up in those tasks that he forgot the plot. I really tried to read every word carefully, but found myself skimming the lengthy descriptive parts while searching for the next ""plot"" (and I use the term loosely) development. The ending was the worst."
2,Over hyped and underwriten,"This book will appeal to readers who think ""The Bridges of Madison County"" is literature. Cold Mountain is a plotless and pointless evocation of an historical era, a task well done, but not worth doing, like listing the best of bubblegum rock. The characters are displayed, but not developed. They are observed, but the reader is not drawn in to see their growth since none is displayed. No one would ever be tempted to re-read this empty narrative."
2,This book was dull,"I was very disappointed with this book because everyone made it out to be some great book and I thought it was boring and dull. It was mainly about two characters, Ada and Inman, who's love was put on hold because Inman went off to war. It went on about everything that happened in their daily lives and it was too descriptive to the point where it annoyed me. I would never recommend this book to anyone because I thought it was the most boring book on the face of this planet."
1,Too much hype,One of the the worst books I've read in a long time. I saw the potential for a good story there but it was all lost in long and flat narratives. Could not identify with any of the characters and have a feeling I really did not get to know them. Very frustrating.
2,real time civil war life and hardship,"Everyone will tell you that the pace of the novel moves deathly slow, and that's true. However, I think the writing technique was used to reflect the pace of the era. The story of a man fed up with fighting for someting he no longer believes in (if he ever thought he did), Inman leaves a southern civil war hospital and heads for home and his sweetheart. He endures unending hardship. Ada and Ruby (especially) give the book whatever glow it has. What drove me, and the other two women who read Cold Mountian with me WILD was the ending. The book would have benefited from a stronger editorial hand. I would not ever waste my time on another book by this author."
1,BORING...,"I have no idea why everyone raves about this book. Maybe because Oprah said to? It's long, dull, slow, wordy, and tortuous to get all the way to the ending. I was extremely disappointed."
1,This book drags on and on and on.,"This book drags on and on and on and on. The story just keeps going on and on. He walks and walks and walks. There isn't any real climax, and the book is just plain boring."
2,<yawn>,"I chose this book to read for summer reading at my high school last year. One of the only reason's I chose the book was beacuse I liked the teacher who recomended the book, and usually trusted her suggestions. Boy was I wrong. This slow moving story of Inman (a wounded Civil War Soldier) and his unending quest to return to his lover Ada. Slow paced, wordy and at times downright dull, I wouldn't highly recomend this book to anyone...this could possibly be one of the worst books I've read...however, if you like slow-moving, easy to follow books (or are a fan of the civil war) than this book might be of interest to you."
3,Too much pointless detail,"I guess the book was good. It was not the best. I don't think it was hard to read just boring. The Ada chapters were good at first but by the end I enjoyed the Inman chapters. Pangle and Veasey were my favorite characters. It was sad Pangle died. The ending was ok, the begining wasn't that good but the middle chapters were the best. It makes you think how hard life was, and how much we take for granit. we expect food and cloths handed to us. They had to work hard everyday for a simple meal. I liked it over all."
5,Lyrical and literate,"I knew nothing of this book when I read it. By the second page, I knew it would be one of my favorites. Frazier's writing manages to be lyrical yet spare, and the story is gripping. Imagine my shock when, upon finishing what I thought was my own ""find"", I discovered it was on the bestseller list at #1"
1,Most overrated book I've read in a while.,"What was all the hoopla about? This was dull, dull, dull. Two bland story lines, one a little compelling, the other not at all. Episodes of extreme cruelty and brutality aren't any fun at all, though they do break up the monotony. I felt this author was too enthralled by his own writing, going on and on and on about, for example, how dark the night was. Okay, it was a dark night. Move on, please."
3,"Beautiful Language, Weak Storyline","This is an excellent example of how one can get a great deal of praise because he/she can write in beautiful language. In other words, the actual art of the word in this novel is superb, but I was not overly impressed with the story. When I started this book, I was so very impressed with the author's voice, as I continued on to the story I was left wanting for more content. I felt like many of the best moments of the books were with the transient characters, which was a shame. Ada, Ruby, and Inman seem to be lacking depth and it seems to me there could have been so much more done with them. In any event, for this first novel, it's excellent, far far better than I could ever hope to write, but still, I was wanting for more."
3,Cold Mountian,The book was exactly what I ordered I just thought I would enjoy the book more than I did.
5,Real,"The two separate stories of the novel both work and work well together. Inman's journey and experience give a great view of the war itself and of the impact it had on civil society. Ada and Rudy's story show that war and hardship can, under the right circumstances, be a springboard for growth and prosperity. The ending was hard to take, even though it was relatively obvious how things would end up.All in all, though, I'd only give the plot 3 or 4 stars. The writing is just really enjoyable, though. It is hard to put yourself in 1860's North Carolina, but Frazier gets you pretty darn close."
1,My cold mountain review,"I didn't really like Cold Mountain that much. It was boring and stupid. I don't believe that there was a Civil War in the first place and now Charles Frazier isn't letting it go. The book had to many pointless characters and very little plot. It seems like he wrote it in his sleep. I think that Charles Frazier wrote one to many books! He should of stopped while he was ahead. But beside the fact that the book had no plot, pointless people, boring chapters, and a stupid ending, I liked the book. I probably would of had more fun diving into an empty pool then reading this book."
1,Socialist Realism,It is hard for me to believe that someone in North Carolina could write a book that is a perfect example of Socialist Realism. It is a story of a proliteriat peasant woman who reforms bourgeois woman into a better life on the land. The hero has deserted an army fighting a war he does not understand. He meets only problems in the cities. The war could have been World War I instead of the Civil War. The army could have been the Czar's army instead of the Confederate. Are the mountains the Carpathian or the Urals? To me the plot is so unreal that it fits Socialist Realism. Lenin and Stalin would have loved it. I did not.
2,Huckleberry Finn was definitely more interesting!,"Frazier's tortuous and rambling account of a Confederate soldier's adventure through the North Carolina landscape was like a tornado of depressingly long and boring descriptions. I am a fan of the succinct, and I believe Frazier worked too hard to try to impress either the reader or himself! The encounters that Inman experienced left me with a negative view on his character. In fact, all of the characters in Cold Mountain lacked not even a semblance of integrity or strength. Ada reminded me of Diane Chambers from Cheers!!! Only Ruby came closest to standing upright. I must say that this novel does an extreme disservice to the people of North Carolina and the South in general. I am no history buff, but I would dare say that this story does not present the real South, either during the time of the Civil War or the present."
1,A Waste of time,"I picked up this book on the basis of all the wonderful reviews that it has recieved, but instead of finding the intriging story that it promised to be I was, bored, sickend and utterly dissalusioned by the content of it. I did not finish it - it wasn't worth it."
1,DREADFULLY BORING!,I buy audiobooks based upon the reviews I see. The reviews on this audiobook were way off base. I had to stop listening to it in the car because I was starting to nod off!
1,I Kept Wishing He'd Stop Walking,"This book was highly recommended by reviewers and friends, but I could barely make it through the trip home. I found myself wishing it would have ended about 200 miles sooner. Read""The Killer Angels"" instead."
1,I thought this book was boring.,This book was not awesome at all...Belive me when I say that it is way over hyped and I would wait for the cliff notes if anyone out there plans on buying this book...
1,"Look up ""boring"" in the dictionary, & you'll find this book","I tried so hard to enjoy this book. I felt I had an obligation, as many friends and relatives had recommended it, and as I am from North Carolina, where much of this novel takes place. But it was torture. After countless hours of reading about this poor man trekking through the woods, and about this poor woman trying to survive on her own, I just gave up. Don't believe the hype."
5,"A great book, one of my all time favorites.","I really liked this book, all of the descriptions, and everything else in this book make it come alive to me. I really like the beginning, how Inman escapes, and Ada is slowly starving to death. THis is one of the greatest books ever, and I recommend this book to everyone."
3,Unmet Expectations,I kept reading and reading and never did really get into it. The plot was thin - but the writing was good.
2,A fascinating journey that goes nowhere,I enjoyed this one up to about half way but then ran out of patience with it. The last half became a real struggle. The low rating is because it failed to live up to its early promise.Inman's journey was for me the most interesting aspect. It shows us the normally unseen harsh and unpleasant side effects of the civil war with fascinating and sometimes repulsive detail. I am looking forward to seeing the movie 'Ride With The Devil' for another slant on the 'home guard'. The problem was that after a while his endless series of hair breadth escapes got a bit much for me. I could not identify with a man who seems to shrug off his daily near death experience and just keep trudging on.Ada's exploration of farming life tended to become a grown-up 'Little House On The Prairie'.Enjoy this book for its great description of the life and times but don't expect any plot progression or deep human insight.
2,What's The Hype All About?,"I found this book to be dull and tedious. Really over-hyped, as most books are. The characters are not really developed enough to make us care what happened to them, and the plot is extremely thin. As such, it is way too long and I found I had to force myself to finish. I had to read it several times to make sure I caught everything. Frazier is a novice writer and it shows. His style needs a lot of work, to say the least. Reading ""Ada said,"" and ""Ruby said,"" tacked on to the end of every sentence was irritating. For all those who think this is ""literature,"" try Umberto Eco's, ""The Name of the Rose."""
2,More Monotony Than Marvel,"My teacher said that 50% of this class would like this book, and 50% would hate it. I am the 1% that makes it 49 1/2% - 49 1/2%. There were parts of it that I liked and parts of it that I hated. The characters were entertaining but their situations were predictable and frustrating. I thought that the reading of the book was just plain old monotony in it's simplest form. I was bored out of my mind."
2,mislead!,"My sister-in-law told me this was TERRIFIC, her favorite book. So, I looked foward to it. The only redeeming feature was the end."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read!,"This book was so incredibly boring and long. It went on and on. I have no idea what fool would ever give this book an award! I think you deserve an award if you finish reading it. I can't believe they made a movie about this book. Honestly, this has got to be one of the all time worst books ever written."
1,ugh ugh ugh,"Both the movie and the book were contrived, boring, and just plain stupid! Who on earth would wait years for someone to come home that they only kissed ONCE??!! Get real. This book is a bore-fest and I went to see the movie to see if it was any different....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
2,Cold Mountain....... leo doesn't like it,I was forced in English class to read a book. She had a bunch of books in the front of the room that she made us pick from. I'm not a big book reader but their are some good points about the book but over all I am not a big fan. If you like to read war books and you are all for wars do NOT read this book. This book is a bout a man (Inman) who dose not won't to go to war (Civil war) and runs away numerous times. It is an anti war book. It also starts out to slow for me I like books that start with an action seen and ends with one. If you're the kind of person who likes love stories then you should read this. It is about a man who tries to find his way home to his girlfriend Ada.
2,dissapointed,"I read Cold Mountain and I was dissapointed in how it ended. The book had me for most of the beginning(even though it dragged a little at some points), but at the end, after Inman traveled for so long and endured so much, for him to just die before Ada and he had a chance to have a life together! It ruined the book for me."
1,"Boring, endless, pointless walk through the south.",I never could understand what drove the two main characters to behave as they did. It was boring and pointless. And too long.
2,Boring....What is all the Hype about?,"THIS could have been a good book, but just could not hold my interest. It was boring for all but maybe 100 pages. If this book was edited down, maybe. A good story line and this would probably make a great movie. There was too much babble, i found it hard to concentrate and enjoy. This book has been winning awards???? I know several people who put it down after 100 pages. It is just not gripping, although it could have been."
2,OVER RATED,"If a description of the flora and fauna of this mountain region of North Carolina interests you as well as cast of quirky characters in the Civil War South, then this book is for you. But is slow moving, tedious, often off on a tangent. The ending is a tragic farce, a let down and a disappointment. Buy this book only if you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind a meander in the woods. I did find the language amusing. Frazier apparently read a lot of Civil War letters to render that period's stilted and long-winded style of speech and written communication. I am amazed that critics fell so in love with this work."
2,Cold Moutain- 2 stars,"I thought Cold Mountain was very boring. The book was better in the beginning but towards the end, it only got worse. When Inman was the main character in the chapters they were boring and Inman only walked. When Ada was the main character they were at least a little bit more exciting. I give it 2 stars."
1,Just Horrible,"Full of flat, uninteresting, unlikable characters. No plot, just random bits of action, the same civil war stories, like the aurora borealis sighting before the battle. And most incredibly annoying of all, THERE ARE NO QUOTATION MARKS AROUND THE DIALOGUE. Couldn't even force myself to finish it."
5,A brillant American epic!!,"I found myself reading and rereading so much of this extraordinary book, because of the author's use of language and descriptive passages, it was as if I were trying to commit it to memory. Not since my first reading of ""Gone With the Wind"" have I been so engrossed with a book and its characters, and so admiring of an author. I cannot wait to read his next book. I believe Cold Mountain is destined to become an American classic."
3,An insightful work of literature,"Frazier invokes a lot of thought on love and the search for love. At times Ada and Inman seemed like very well rounded, three dimensional characters but at many points throughout the novel they seemed flat and boring. The same can be said for the plot. I think that if done right this story will make a better movie than novel."
2,A 'local novel' or 'book-next-door'.,"From all the plaudits lauded onto this book my expectations were high. Not so my praise at the end of the trudge. Yes it has good historical perspective and characters but it does nothing for our region or its readers other than soak both in dullness. It is laboriously predictable throughout and the repetition of possibilities is sad. A great opportunity, well written but missing the chance. A book to remember for all the wrong reasons."
1,Stay Away!,"I had to read this book for book club and didn't think I would make it though. Please spare yourself, this book is long and depressing. I don't know how it won an award!"
2,What's the hype all about?,"I am a voracious reader and I was looking forward to ""Cold Mountain"" because I had heard so many wonderful things about it and I am always looking for good novels about the Civil War. This book was quite a disappointment! Getting used to Frazier's literary style was not an easy task (what's the point of not using quotation marks?) and I found myself wanting to rush through the book just so I could finish it, not because any of the characters were at all compelling. The topper was the ending! To have spent so much time getting through this book, waiting for the reunion, etc., and to be so jarringly disappointed was just ridiculous; it felt false and contrived and I put the book away feeling like I'd been robbed. I gave it 2 stars because it's not like it was a piece of trash, but I can't reccomend it to anyone."
1,PACE!!--PACE!!--PACE!!,"I'M NOT SURE IF I AM ALLOWED TO USE THE WORD """"PACE"""" IN A REVIEW.WELL--HERE GOES---THIS WAS THE SLOWEST, DRAGGING, BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.""""ATLAS SHRUGGED"""" FLEW BY---BY COMPARISON.AND---IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER---BY ABOUT 80 TO 100 PAGES, I'D SAY.WHEN INMAN DIES---THAT FUNERAL / BURIAL WOULD HAVE LASTED PAGE AFTERPAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER . . ."
2,I don't think so...,"I found the book readable but only because I kept thinking it would get better. Which is not to say the book was bad...exactly, but I do wonder why the author had the narrator use mountain idioms throughout--it gave one the feeling that everyone involved with the book (author, characters, narrator) was in cahoots to sound as backward as possible. After a while it started to sound as if it was a parody of that culture rather than a description. Also, I was irked that he had the characters use so, so many quaint similes and metaphors in describing anything that came to their mind.On the positive side, the book had charm and poignancy in it's descriptions of Inman's and Ada's struggles with their reality and I could feel, at times, the horror of the war, and the beauty of an isolated mountain meadow. I applaud the author's efforts at trying to put together this story of a particular time and place, but do not recommend it for the average reader."
2,THE CLOUDS WERE LIKE FLUFFY WHITE BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH..,"This book was way too long. I liked the concept of the book, but the characters held no substance. If you deleted every un-nessessary sentance of external detail, you would be left with a 50 page book. I kind of liked the book, but I couldn't read more than a chapter at a time without falling asleep. I think it would have been better if Inman and Ada had met earlier.For those of you who haven't read the book yet... Inman DIES in the end. You're welcome. Love, Lady"
2,nature channel,"In the first half of the book, Frazier goes into lengthy descriptions of trees, flowers, grass, bugs and stir of the wind...Can we have some more actions and less sensitivity in here? It was a really boring book."
1,Poor effort by Frazier.,"For a more accurate portrayal of the Civil War in WNC, read Clyde Ray's ""Across The Dark River""."
2,Overall disappointing.,"I looked forward to reading this book; as I got further into it I was struck with the constant references to excrement, human and otherwise; graphic killings; and a series of distasteful, totally unredeeming characters that Inman meets along the way. I stuck it out til the end hoping the end would be worth it; it wasn't. I had suspected the outcome; and was disappointed to find my suspicions correct. Pluses for the book were the female charcters, Ada and Ruby. Also the extensive research and authenticity with reference to vocabulary of that time, names of flora and fauna, and things like kinds of tools. The brutal treatment of ordinary citizens during that time and the efforts taken to hunt down the outliers do have a lasting effect on the reader. But overall, I was disappointed in the actual story."
3,felt disappointed slow paced too much description not meaty,I was excited to purchase this book because of all the rave reviews however I was very let down. I found the book slow moveing and it described too much stuff that had no importance to the story line or maybe i am just too simple minded but a butterfly landing on his p**s what relevance did that have ??? Any how the end was so so the gore was gore and very descriptive but once you get the picture don't beat the dead horse with more flowery description of how dead it is DEAD is DEAD. I forced myself to finish reading the book because i payed full hardcover price otherwise i would not have wasted my time. Did have some good points but I can't recall any off hand. SORRY CHARLIE!!!!!!
3,Disapponting,"After all the hype about this novel, I expected some thing more. It was an interesting read, but nothing spectacular."
2,,"i began reading Cold Mountain for my Honors English 11 class. the book begins slow, continues to drag on like a patient on a morphine drip and then finally, ends. at first many people complained about the description, but i didn't really seem to notice. the mental picture Frazier created for the reader did not enhance nor did it lower my opinion of the book. in fact, the book, in itself, despite the slow and tedious pace, was alright. the only thing that didn't do it for me was the ending. i absolutely despised it. it was not nearly as horrific as it should of been, or as it was foretold to be. not that i'm a sadist or anything, but when you write a novel as depressing as Cold Mountain, you should bloody well follow through with a tragic ending."
2,"A book of bad endings, and mostly dead good characters.....","This Book was interesting, it started off wit something to grab most peoples attention. It gave you a good promise for a storyline. But in the end, delivered a horrible ending, yet that was well backed up. For even though the ending was stupid, unthought out, and short, it was well given. For there was little to change, without changing the most of the storyline, and character development. But, there was shining light in this entire book, that was good and funny....Veasey. Veasey was a good, funny character that gave the book a spin for a while. Simple review of this book, if you like a lot of storyline, and maybe a bit of wonder, don't read this book, but if you like some love story, coming of age, or jorney tale books, it's for you."
3,A skip-a-page-athon,"I loved Frazier's writing and imagery, and found the setting of the novel dramatic. However, when thinking about the novel's main story, that of reunited love, I thought that Inman's and Ada's motivations central to that cause were bewildering and underdeveloped. A brief conversation here, a few hours spent together there seemed woefully inadequate to explain the force of their attraction. On top of that, Frazier fills the book up with lots of fluff and inane occurances that have nothing to do with the central story. It seems that the main point is to prove that Inman is a tough but sensitive guy and Ada matures into a tough but sensitive woman. All this adds up to me skimming or skipping page after page, especially near the end, at a time when you should relish each paragraph. Nice try this time, better luck next time!"
4,flawed charmer,"Maximum flavor of the rural South, similar in effect and resonance to Faulkner, but with a more digestible structure. An odd juxtaposition of melodrama and barebones cynicism."
3,a picaresque jack tale...,"i am having trouble deciding if i like this book or not..if i understand it or not and if i wholly appreciate the historical significance..one comment i would like to make. i have never heard mention of ""the jack tales,"" a collection of tales from the oral tradition of the south, in connection with this book...i did appreciate the characters he met...however..."
4,More than a civil war story. A trip in time.,"I usually do not read civil war books, however I am glad that I did pick this book up. It was more than a civil war story. It was a journey through time meeting interesting characters along the way. It made you want to travel the same roads today and meet the people along the trail. Some characters were mean and nasty while others were fun, troubled, a little off balance. Just like what you would find if you made the trip in our times. I particulaly like that he was returning home to what he hoped was true not what he knew was true. The book showed strong women characters and while not funny did give rise to a little chuckel occassionally. It was well written and a great read. I think it would make a great movie."
2,"Good Beginning, Predictable Story Book Ending.","I was disappointed with the ending of ""Cold Mountain"" , it seemed to lose the drama and become a predictably rosy romance novel. It is hard to believe that this novel has been a best seller for so long, or is it?"
2,"Graphic,long, and off the subject","This book was supposed to be about the civil war! Well at least the first two chapters were anyway. Some of the chapters were funny and the charicters themselves were fun and interesting,but other than that I didn't like the book. It's two stories into one which is fun,but in my oppinion, the Inman story is funner than the Ada story only because the Inman stories were adventurous-he actually went out of the house. Ada stayed in the same area at all times wining about how her life was so boring and feeling sorry for her self. I wouldn't have read this book if I didn't have to. I thought the book was all right."
5,A poignant book,"A heart wrenching tale of a man trying to make his way home through a war savaged country. The description is vivid, the problems tangible, and the characters rise from the page. It is a hard story. One I would not subject myself to in movie form. But the book was excellent. It is a story of war and love and the pain that both can cause."
1,Very Anticlimactic,"I had to FORCE my way through two-thirds of the book because it was drawn out and aimless. I was hoping that after all of Inman's suffering and persistance to get back home to be with Ada that they would typically live happily ever after. BUT NNOOOO...This ""romantic story"" left me with the impression that they weren't even happy to see each other when they finally reunited. However, I did get a good sense of what the War was like and if the book would have been about just Inman's experience rather than giving it a romanic twist, then I wouldn't have expected a happier outcome because war is hell."
4,not a typical civil war story,"Great book but a little depressing. I had some trouble getting through the book but when I did finally finsih I was glad I had read it. I would recommend this book, but not to the person who want's a happy ending."
3,The book of frustration,"This tale is frustrating only because if you are unfamiliar with this auther at first its hard to adapt to how he expresses the talking whithin the characters. Other than that its a pretty easy read and has alot of sybolism and realism expressed within it. He stuffed lots of minor events that eventually builds up to the climax that effectively hooks the reader. However, he includes so many every day activities that sometimes create dull spots whithin the book. It is a well written book, but it seems to be more directed toward more of the romantic category."
2,book review,"Cold Mountain was such a detailed book that it was hard to read at times. There are so many little things that go on, thus so much to remember.Inman's journey was the most exciting part of the book. I can't believe everything that happened to him throughout it though. Getting caught by the homeguard and escaping, encountering Lila, Lula, Junior, and almost dying a number of times. All of the people he met were different, and he learned something from all of them. Despite everything that happened to him, he still makes it home to Ada. Nothing for him goes as planned, and maybe thats better for him that way.Ada is still my favorite character, even though she did get kind of boring. I blame that on her situation. She did practically a 360 from being a helpless girl who doesn't know how to do anything, to a woman who can hold her own on her farm."
2,Cold Mountain....ugh....,Cold Mountain was very well written. The characters were very memorable and amusing. The book was very descriptive in almost every action a character did. That was the doing and the downfall of the book for me. Though his writing gave me a clear picture in my head the undeniable use of external detail made the book drag and made it londer than it actually is.Ada was probably my favorite character. Her parts were very comical and entertaining along with ruby on the farm. The Inman scenes were also good but he just kept walking which made him tedious and boring. If it wasn't for the good ending i would have given it 1 star instead of 2.
