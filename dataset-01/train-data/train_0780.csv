3,Trying something new for an old favorite,"Tried the unit while visiting and it seemed to make short work out of apple preperation for pie baking. While the unit contained instructions quite a few apples had to be put to the proverbial test run. The run was awkward and the base didn't stick (suctioned) as well as it needed to be. Use of the included clamp revealed manufacturing flaws that kept the base not still at all.Will I throw it away, NO, the science is good but not the holding still. Will experiment and maybe build a better mouse trap."
4,Apple Peeler review,"The apple peelers seems to work fine.The suction cup also seems to work fine so far. Have not used it myself, but my wife has and I have heard no complaints."
4,This is awesome!!,"I had no idea this existed! I think about all the time and effort I've spent peeling apples and potatoes!! This thing works! It peeled the apples with no problem at all. It peeled potatoes very well. I had a very large potato and while it didn't peel the ends, it peeled the rest of it great! It does tend to miss a spot here and there depending on how big your produce is, but I don't find it to be that big of a deal. I only wish I knew this device existed prior to now!"
3,"good, but was hoping for more functions","I am pleased with the apple peeler, corer and slicer. I wish the functions were a bit more independent, that I could peel and core with out slicing. Its fun to use and my kids (ages 6, 7, & 8) love to use it to help my make applesauce, pies, and even peeling potatoes."
5,Another Must-Read from Dr. Onuzo!,"I am not ashamed to say I admire Dr. Onuzo. His books and message tapes have been a tremendous blessing to me. They have been enlightening, liberating, challenging and insightful.This book dispels many of the myths we have built up or had instilled in us about prayer. It shows us that, ""If you can talk, you can pray.""I thoroughly recommend it for those who have been afraid to pray, are too timid to pray, have bought into the wrong notion of prayer, or for those whose prayer life just needs a booster shot.You will not regret taking the time to go through this very readable book."
4,This is not a Disney film - This is a grownup adventure,"True to the book by Jack London, the dog Buck is kidnapped and taken to Alaska to be a team dog. Buck is not a purebred German Shepard but a mix with Rottweiler. Unlike the book, there are women in Alaska - prostitutes and saloon keepers. Buck develops a loyalty to Charlton Heston. The lighting of the DVD is deliberately toned down. On a bet, Buck proves he can haul 500 pounds on a sled which keeps him from being shot in the head. Out in the wild, he makes off with a female wolf, who has a litter of his puppies. Charlton Heston, panning for gold, is killed and buried in the snow and ice. Buck attacks the attackers. Like the book, Buck joins a pack of wolves at the end, abandoning any human contact. There is not a lot of blood, only to show that Buck has prevailed. Buck has found freedom at last."
1,"Worst quality DVD I have even owned, to date.","Video is bad, audio is bad, packaging is bad. Watching this DVD right out of the box is like watching a VHS tape that has been run 100 times. *NOT* recommended for any DVD fan. Maybe you'll have better luck with a VHS tape. Spend your money somewhere else."
3,Perfect for use with an 8th grade class!,"My students really loved seeing the book come to life with this movie! However, it is ALWAYS fun to hear the students commenting on how much more they enjoyed the book, particularly the reluctant readers!"
1,Poor quality DVD...,"Not having seen the film version of this movie I can't say if the poor video quality comes from the DVD only version or not...but I can say that the DVD version isn't too good. The audio is also very poor. The story is basically the same as the book with some typical Hollywood alterations. Also, no interactive DVD features at all. All-in-all disappointing, but my 9 year old son liked it."
1,NOT recommended,"I bought this DVD expecting it to be a good one, since Heston starred. I was totally disappointed and wish I would have never bought it. The picture and sound quality is horrible, and so is the music. Way too much swearing too! They could have left those parts out. It's like during the whole movie, all you hear is dogs whining, and loud poor-sounding music. If I wouldn't have read the book before, I would have never gotten the plot. Not to mention it's totally inaccurate. To make my point, I wouldn't waste my money."
1,<< Shouldn't have been transferred to DVD >>,"This is not only a disappointing movie but also a disappointing dvd. First the DVD: Soundtrack is distorted. No dvd menu. Has 'film flips' - I thought something was wrong with my VCR tape. Wait! I'm not using a VCR; this is a dvd.Now for the movie. The book is written from the dog's perspective. The movie is more from Heston's position. The plot was changed. The characters in the scenes were incorrect. My 10 year old son kept nodding his head; saying, hey, this didn't happen......"
3,Same as above,"It isn't the orginal movie back when the we watched it on VHS, it was a lot different. We will still keep this and hopefully enjoy it to. The one on VHS had a German Shepard dog as the star instead of a Husky.,but the old movie was not a good picture or sound wasn't any good either."
1,WORTHLESS VHS COPY,THIS IS THE WORST QUALITY VHS I EVER ORDERED FROM AMAZON. PAYING FOR THIS IS A PURE RIP-OFF. IT IS FIT MAYBE FOR A TWO-BIT YARD SALE ITEM.
2,Poor Quality-Okay movie,"I give two stars because one star is too harsh. Call of the Wild is not the worst movie, but the quality of the dvd is very aweful like it is an archaic film which affects enjoyment of the movie. This movie is very similar to White fang : the wolf/dog, a loyal companion of the human, people saying the wolf/dog is vicious, accidently finding gold, a character falling into the ice lake and running around the fire to keep warm, enemies attacking the cabin and also lighting it on fire, wolf/dog parts with main character but reunites several times. Music and scenes are not that great."
1,such a shame,i was telling my wife of a film i had seen when i was a child that was both excellent and moving.......CALL OF THE WILDso i sourced it from australia as the dvd is deleted in the uk.i thought i had given my money to a con man who had sent me a pirate copy until i read reviews from other buyers.never have i seen such a rough dvd with the most awful picture and sound quality. the film is also one of the most dissapointing i have seen and i am embarrassed that i admitted to my wife that it made me cry when i was a kid!!!i can only presume that it was the trauma of sitting through such badly worked material that upset my childhood.....do yourself a favour and buy white fang instead.such a shame
1,Not worth it,"My mom purchased the video for my viewing pleasure, but I wasn't pleased. The music in the beginning sounds sort of alienated, the picture quality is horrible, and you actually see dogs tearing apart an animal and leaving its blood everywhere! I could only watch twelve minutes before I decided that it was not worth it to watch. If you ever, for any reason, actually WANT to watch the movie, then I recommend you read the book first, because the book is MUCH better than the movie."
2,"""Family-freindly"" my butt!!",This movie was very poor. For one thing this is NOT family friendly. For example in one scene these dogs get mad and they attack each other and in the end of that scene one of the dogs WAS RIPPED APART AND WAS VERY BLOODY. Also my Mom says that a scene were cut. Also the music is horrible. Also there was one very stupid curse they called the dogs(very ironic) also if you know spanish you can get an easter egg from the song they sing. In a few scenes all of a sudden stuff is completely red.
1,not that good of a book,when i got this book i thought it would be very good. but i did not like it a all. in one page of the book its all about how joathan giving the animals food. this book was not a good book at all.
3,It was the best book.,It was a great book. It took place in the winter on Hemlock Mountain. It is about some hunters and some bears. It was cool because I liked how it ended. I am eight years old.
3,The Bears on Hemlock Mountain,I liked the book because there were bears there. I liked it when Jonathan's father came and I liked the squirrels. I would tell a friend to read this book because it has animals in it. It has bears in it.
3,A lighter shade of blues,"3 1/2Creative classic rock digs deep with some memorable melodies, evading excellence from the little disposable hippie pop and fuzzed-out overkill heard."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I never had this on vinyl or CD, but the album brings back fond memories that I can more or less remember. When I saw this picture disc, I had to have it. The quality of the pressing is so bad, I removed the LP from the turntable in less than 30 seconds in fear of destroying my $200.00 stylus!"
5,cream of Cream,"Ginger, Eric and Jack are the three wisemen of 60's rock and roll, mostly because they made great music and survived the decade. This is THE definitive psychedelic mind-trippin CD for anyone's 'hey I wanna listen to the true old school' collection."
3,Good music but very dated.,This is not an album that has stood the test of time. The sound is very 60s. If you want a trippy summer of love album then grab this album.
1,Remaster ripp-off,"I can't believe this. just recieved Disraeli Gears remasters. This CD was never remastered, I played it along with the orignal CD, AND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. Moral of this story, Don't waste your money on cream remasters. Also, no additional text, and no bonus tracks. I also bought Fresh Cream remasters, can't wait till it comes in the mail, so I can throw it in the trash along with Disraeli Gears!"
3,Overrated,"Cream have been called rock pioneers, but I find this title to be a joke. This trio was a dime store white blues band. There are a few catchy popish songs such as Sunshine of Your Love and Strange Brew, but tracks like Blue Condition, Dance the Night Away, Outside Woman Blues and Take It Back this album copies the blues mold more than they did forge the rock mold. Some fine instrumentalists, but this band lacks creativity, originality and flavor."
1,"if you haven't get reefer, don't bother","Yet another classic that only became popular because their audience was stoned. Blaring, muddy, unmusical crud."
1,excess at its worst,"If like pretentious, excessive rock n roll this album may be for you. There are a few good songs, but for the most part it is annoying as hell."
1,YIKES!!!!! This is really bad,"When I heard this I couldn't believe my ears : YIKES!!!!This is really BAD BAD music, very BAD and UNINSPIRED.It is just a bunch of UGLY DUMB sounds and the guitarrists can't even play and the drummer sounds like Terry from my class who had ADHD and the girl who sings sounds like she has to go potty all the time.I like music but this is oreful!"
5,Creams the Competition,"""Disraeli Gears"" is the album that gave Cream the title of a supergroup. After ""Fresh Cream,"" the band was not seen as anything special, but some saw their potential. When this album was released, however, it flew to the top of the charts.This CD starts with ""Strange Brew,"" which is, in itself, a 'strange' song. Excellent, of course, and Bruce's and Clapton's duet makes this a psychedelic masterpiece. Next is the well-known ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" which is arguably the best song by Cream. It is certainly my favorite. The odd poetry and famous guitar opening makes this a classic.Other notable songs are ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" and ""SWALBR"" earned a lot of radio air play. Also, ""Blue Condition"" shows Clapton's old roots from his blues days, something that he would get back to later in his career."
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS*****,THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF MUSIC TO COME OUT OF THE LATE 60'S THAT YOU WILL HEAR. IF YOU CAN SPRING IT BUY THE SHM CD FROM JAPAN. THIS WAS AN ALBUM THAT NEEDED TO BE SMOOTHED OUT A BIT SOUNDWISE. THAT BEING SAID-THIS IS A HEADSET CD. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.
5,Pure Classic Rock,"Anyone who remembers real classic rock from the 60's knows this CD is a must have. It makes it easy in CD form to hear it and has good sound qualty, having been re-mastered. I think it's fantastic to have something from a great band that only lasted a brief time."
5,The quintessential Cream.,"Yes there are other albums and singles that may strike your fancy. But this one is the first to come to mind when mentioning Cream. It is too bad that the samples stop before ""Tales Of Brave Ulysses"" as each track is unique. Therefore you have to listen to them all to get a more complete picture of this group.Warning this album is addictive I find my self singing, ""Sunshine of Your Love"" a little too loud at work and then I hear others completing the words from other cubes.Those Were the Days"
2,Headphone music at it's finest!,"Cream, why do think they called themselves Cream? Because they were the ""cream of the crop"" musically speaking. What else can be said of Clapton, one of the top 3 guitar players of all-time, but throw in the best drummer ever without a doubt, Ginger Baker and great bass guitar player and very good singer, Jack Bruce and you truely have perfection.I had ""Sunshine of your Love"" played as the first song at my wedding in 1986. If any of the non-talented musicians of the 1990's could even come close to Disraeli Gears they would be bigger than Elvis! I have listened to this album for 28 years and it still gives me goosebumps!!!!"
2,Classic?,"Maybe I just didn't get it, but this album definitely doesn't fall into my ""Classic album"" category. The drums are hard panned to the left in every song, and sound like suitcases comprised most of the kit. The guitar is pretty bluesy with some psychedelic flavor, but I didn't find any of the playing revolutionary. The lyrics are beyond bad and are cheesy and unmeaningful. The whole thing just sounds muddy, like a train wreck of styles. I hate to say it, but this album just didn't stand the test of time. Supposedly this is remastered, so I can only imagine how terrible an original would sound."
1,Be careful.,"I received this CD and was unable to copy it. I sent it back for a replacement and they sent me a used copy with a broken case, even though I paid full price for a new one. Although the copy of the CD was scrached it was good enough to rip. Now I am stuck with a CD that is scratched with a broken case."
1,The review of Bass Masters 2000,I found this game incredibly boring. It was the wors't game I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly terrible and the sound... well that was to bad for words. The idea of fishing on Nintendo is very very stupid and I would not reccomend this game to anybody. It was a terrible terrible and I give it a pitiful 0 out of 1000000000000000000000000000.
3,Tool kit review,"It has the necessary flashlight, jumper cables, air pump for the tires and emergency stuff. The case is big and bulky and the stuff doesn't stay secured in the case. The case doesn't have a good closing catch. I threw the case out and bought a bag and put all the stuff in the bag."
4,very good,I bought this product as a give to someone for the christmas. The feedback that I recieved is that the kit was complete. This product is very good. On one occation it was used and it was excellent.
5,Systematically Excellent in all Categories,"The writing in the Paris Review is probably unmatched elsewhere in a popularly available magazine. Other magazines and reviews sometimes have top quality pieces, maybe one or two excellent pieces in each issue, but I found that the high standards of quality in the Paris Review is very rarely matched. The Paris Review unlike most publications is systematically excellent.The fictional stories are interesting and seemingly unique. The poetry is vivid and compelling. The interviews and non-fiction pieces also are no less enticing, excellent and important. If you are interested in writing, in reading compelling fiction and non-fiction, or the creative arts generally, I strongly recommend this magazine."
2,Damaged,"The product arrived on time, but bent. I have no idea how something could get so twisted in shipping. The handle of the sword was at a 90 degree angle. It was amazing. It would have taken too long to send back, so I just bent it back into form."
4,Rurouni Kenshin sakabato,"This is a nice product, full-sized, made of stainless steel. It was slightly damaged upon arrival, and some of the craftsmenship seems a little shoddy, but for $25, I wasn't expecting perfection. It looks exactly like the sword in the anime, the only difference being the stamped ""Made in China"" right on the blade when you open it. That's a little annoying, but from any distance, isn't noticeable. Overall, it's a nice product and I received it quickly upon payment."
3,not authentic,"if you want a reverse blade sword you can use in combat (yes, they do exist) get a true Sakabotou... i wouldnt suggest you use this sword in combat... and yes, you can harm someone with a blade of this classification... Sakabotous are made to defend yourself without having the need to draw blood or kill, but you can turn the blade and make it into a lethal katana (if you get a decent quality one)"
5,The most amazing book I have ever read,"I read this book at a University level history course, and honestly after reading many history books, some of which were dense and biased, I could not have been more pleasantly surprised with McMaster's book. His amazing discoveries and extensive research were presented in an eloquent style, differing much from my previously read books. The book tiggered an interest in the history and cosequences of the War in Vietnam as well as matured my naive views of the government. This book should be required reading for all University students, politicians, and military officers as it could prevent a future situation such as the Vietnam War due to its educational value."
3,"Important, informative, but too long","I picked up this book because I heard that it influenced D. Rumsfeld significantly, and to gain more knowledge on the Vietnam War itself. This book gives a very detailed account on the inner workings of the J.B. Johnson's White house, and how the decisions on the war were made. The book argues that these were made with other (domestic, etc.) considerations in mind, and hence undermined the war effort. There is also a stress on the deceit of the president as well as the compliance (active/passive) of his staff. The problem with this book is that is it very drawn out, and gets rather repetitive. The epilogue summarizes a good deal of the book in 15 pages. I also would have liked more time spent on setting a historical context and outcome, something which might be redundant to Vietnam experts. Overall an important book which should have been edited better"
4,Great Read!,"This book is very insightful of the enormous responsibility the American people place in our elected officials and how their egos and hubris can lead to a series of bad decisions with devastating, irreversible consequences through the cost of human life. The most remarkable passages in this book were those that rationalized decisions that would lead to the loss of human life and comparing that loss casually with deaths in a car accident. No official who has the power and responsibility to decide when Americans should fight and die should look at the loss of life so wantonly - ever."
4,"Well researched, well written","A must read for all military professionals and government officials. Describes clearly the tensions inherent in a system where civilians control the military. Eye opening, exposes the details behind the scenes of the Vietnam War. Some interesting parallels to the challenges we face in today's wars."
5,Brilliant Explanation of Vietnam Disaster,"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in how and why Vietnam became an American War. McMaster does not buy McNamara's explanation that the war was the result of the Cold War ideology of containing communism. The author shows through new evidence that not only was the war in Vietnam not inevitable, but was made possible only by lies aimed at the American Congress, the public, and members of Lyndon Johnson's own Administration. The behavior of the generals, especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff was also surprising and disappointing. If you are interested in what is happening in Washington today there is a sad, important lesson in Dereliction of Duty. The lesson is that character matters in public office and that lies can have disastrous consequences. This book deepened my respect for those who did their duty in Vietnam despite the dubious and dishonest leadership in Washington."
4,One of the best books ever written on the Vietnam War.,"I enjoyed reading this book because it was the first book about the war in Vietnam that explored the involvement and the role of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The book also shows how the differences of opinion and disagreements between the Joint Chiefs, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and President Lyndon Johnson led to the escalation of the war and why the United States had lost. This a really good book."
2,"If it is written, then it must be so.","The public get soaked once more from a ""Vietnam"" book. Nothing new is in this book. We (those in the military) have read this drival over and over in hopes of finding really useful information. Will the repetition ever stop? The extra star is for the effort in research. This would have been an excellent dissertation...no challenge from anyone."
1,Worse than pulling teeth.,"I read this for a class in Vietnam. If it was possible to give this book less than one star, I would. It essentially takes the conspiricy theory approach, blaming everyone in any position of power for the War. McMaster draws out 25 pages of Vietnam in my US History book into 300+. Required reading of this book is like pulling teeth: You know you have to, but you'd really rather let it stay there. It's only outstanding feature is the sheer amount of information in the book. Unless you enjoy reading that interprets the slightest variation of punctuation in a memo, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,Vietnam disaster cause,"Not the most elegant or flowing prose, but the author depicts over and over again the passivity and parochialism of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the duplicity of Robert McNamara, as we slid into a major war. Left unsaid is that the stratagy and tactics for fighting the war were almost the exact reverse of what was needed. The main point in a guerrilla war is to protect the populaion----body count is very much the wrong way to think. We got into the war and lost it because of the failure of the Joint Chiefs to do their job."
3,Good for the un-informed.,"Fresh face adding a different perspective. A great book for those who were not privy to the politics of leadership during the War. But again, something we already knew. I grabbed the book as soon as it came off the press. While reading it, I felt a sense of deja-vu. I re-visited Ambrose, Karnow, McNamara, Westmoreland, Palmer, Halberstam, and a few others....was this a thesis? Impressive detailed research and handling of chronology, but again, to the informed this was old news. Wheeler's problems were well documented, Westmoreland was already known as the Dan Quayle of the era, and the gored chain of command both political and military was, again, well known to those who were interested...no secrets there. But I like this book -- the more that is written about the lunacy and bungling of Johnson and Westmoreland will eventually convince an apathetic population to look a little closer at the Yugoslavia's, Haiti's, and Granada's."
2,Dereliction of writing,"Book is extremely factual and presents unknown information regarding the initial entry and build up of American troops. However, if you want an entertaining read this is not the book. Sorry!"
4,To narrowly focused to explain why.,"This is a very well researched book, but limited in trying to explain why we got into Viet Nam. A better read is America's Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975 by Herring."
4,Should be mandatory reading for all senior uniformed leaders,"After 31 years of military service I thought I was immune to incompetence in high places, but this book kept me grinding my teeth throughout. No where have I found a more damning indicment of the sheer arrogance and ignorance of the Ivy League elite. It is exceeded only by the total abdication of their duty by the members of the JCS. Every uniformed officer who aspires to Unified Command or Service Chief should be required to read this book and swear he will never allow it to happen on his watch!"
5,All time favorite,"I absolutely LOVE this album! I have had the cassette tape since childhood, and wanted to listen to it all the time. I especially loved going to sleep to the whale calls. I still have the tape, and it still lulls me to sleep. The music is beautiful, and the whale calls are simply magical. I'm actually surprised that it's still being offered. Would be awesome to get it in MP3 format, however I may break down and buy the CD, just so I can listen to it more often!"
4,A good sized clipper blade,"I have two miniature schnauzers and do all their grooming with an Oster A-5 2 speed clipper. This blade leaves their coats nicely cut but long enough so they still have hair to keep them warm. You will have to groom more frequently if you use this length blade, however. I only use it in the winter. It would be good on other breeds. The quality of the blade itself is very good."
5,The 36 Hour Day,"This is a really good book. I kept borrowing it from the library and kept getting fined for having it too long, so I thought I'd save myself time and trouble (and money, too) and buy it. I've come across alot of the same things that are mentioned in the book. This book is helpful to give the caregiver a different perspective on AD and it's nice to know that you're not alone in your struggles. It also reminds you that others have it worse than you do. I recommend this book for anyone who has elderly relatives, with the increased incidence of AD the chances are pretty good/bad that a relative will suffer from it. I think it's best to be prepared for the worst before it gets here. That way you'd have a start on what care would be required and how much you'll have to change your life to accomadate your aging relatives."
5,Every Caregiver Should Read This Book,"As the caregiver (daughter-in-law) of a 90 year old patient with dementia (vascular/multi-infact type), I found this book to be profoundly helpful in dealing with the day-to-day activities of caregiving. In short, I felt as if the authors had spent several weeks in our home and then written the book just for us! This is a MUST READ for any caregiver of a patient with Alzheimer's or other dementias."
3,Caregiving,"The book is OK to a point, but did not go into answering questions such as: why am I still here? I'm 96, why am I here? Did God forget me?I know about the physical caregiving. It's the mental and emotional caregiving that needs more attention in the book."
4,Alzheimer/Dementia helper,"Helps to understand what one may have to go through as a person w/ Alzheimer/dementia progresses through his or her illness. Also, has resources/contacts in the back of book."
3,Good experience,"Although the info in the book was pretty basic, it is a good resource for the uninitiated. The book came promptly & the total experience was good."
5,36- Hour Day Review,"Sensational book, excellent when it comes to gaining patience and understanding the rapidly deteriorating mind of a a person with Alzheimers. I recommend it 100%."
2,Very old paperback,"I received the book in a timely fashion, however I was disappointed that the pages were very yellow with age even though the description indicated the book was in good condition."
3,book condition,The book arrived as stated and was in OK condition but the print is very small and very difficult to read.
2,oh no i hate the pilot,the pilot was never a favorite of mine since dirk benedict was not in it. another actor played face-man but was let go since he looked to young to be a vietnam veteran. one of the best two parters The bend in the river is not included. barry van dyke was the guest star[van dyke was in galactica 1980] while dirk benedict made a guest appearance and was scheduled to return if the show was not cancelled.
3,A list of the episodes included in this set.,"Not here to write a review, just to give a list of some of the episodes included in this set. I just glanced at the DVDs at the store so I can't remember all of the episodes, but here is a list of most of them.1. Mexican Slayride, Pt. 12. Mexican Slayride, Pt. 23. Bullets and Bikinis4. Body Slam5. Breakout!6. The Sound of Thunder7. Without Reservations"
2,Pow Wow,I wasn't impressed with the illustrations in this book. The cover photo is wonderful but the illustrations inside the book are done with colored pencil and are few and far between.I gave the book away after I looked through it and wasn't impressed. I felt it had been misrepresented as a pictorial essay on Pow Wow Costumes from the cover photo which is excellent.
3,Very nice bit,"This book falls shy of a couple stars for me for one reason:Although the photographs are all very well done, clear,and pletiful, they are all inside studio settings only.Compared to outdoors settings and natural light, these picsloose something crucial in the translation.There are NO outdoor shots and, most importantly, NO PICTURESOF NATIVE DANCING!! Can't believe it!! I can'tbelieve that a book of ceremonial dress woulb have nopictures including dancing ceremonies, for the costumes truely come alive when in motion. Tsk-tsk for not even giving us even a few - such pictures are the main reason I bought the book. Two or three would have helped immensely. Otherwise, I agree with the other reviewers, who don't seem to mind the omission I mention."
4,A Sweet Book,"This book was very sweet. It was also sad.It was about a little girl and her ""Hero"" a lovable St. Bernard. The book is easy to follow and understand. I would recommend this book for children of 8 and up. It will be a wonderful addition to your own libray."
5,From the Past,"I can't remember where or when this book came into my possession. But, my daughter reminded me of it this evening when we were on the phone.This is a quirky, fun book for those who want to experiment with some fine sourdough cooking. Jack Mabee's recipes are easy, fun, and taste darned good. Back when I was baking regularly (in the 1980's), I used the instructions in this book to make some fine breads and plenty of pancakes for the kids.At the time I was baking once a week -- bread for the table and Saturday-morning sourdough dollar-sized pancakes for the kids. They were so good I ate them off the grill without syrup. The kids put a lot of them away.Besides the recipes, the book is just fun with many anecdotes and stories from Mabee's past.It's out of print now, but well worth finding a used copy. That is, it's worth the effort if you like books of this vintage and have a taste for western cooking in the sourdough tradition."
4,Wow! Great Work for a Young Grant & March,"This movie was a remarkable and pleasant surprise. The subject matter is sobering, and was dealt with very well. It showed that Hollywood producers had more than just a romantic view of war, depicting, as carefully as they could back then, the toll that war can take on the soldiers involved. Nor is it overly patriotic. Fredric March deserves to share the cover with Grant on the box, though. But, I realize what it takes to sell a movie.Mr. Grant's role was well incorporated into the film, with a good balance between he and Fredric March. A pretty good job by the director, I guess. And again, not depicting him as an obvious hero, either. I enjoy seeing Grant in these roles; he seemed to put a lot of effort in whatever he did, even his early films. Not a lazy actor at all -- very refreshing!He was soo young and slender! And even in this role, I guess he just couldn't help but look handsome too. They don't make 'em like that any more!(--an admiring young lady)"
2,Disappointed,"Not what I expected. It was not written the way other ""case"" oriented texts are in my opinion."
4,Lady Be Bad - Elaine Raco Chase,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERTHE LADY WAS DETERMINED TO GET HER MANShe was the Face of the Century -- exclusive model for Kingman Cosmetics. Marlayna O'Brian's world was golden. Then the invitation arrived. Noah Drake was getting married. Noah Drake, the man who'd broken her heart, the man she still loved for better or worse. Even now, after six years, Marlayna refused to give him up without a fight. She might possess wealth, glamour, and success beyond her wildest dreams, but without Noah, her life was empty. When Marlayna RSVP'd, she had only one aim in mind: to be in Noah's arms again--no matter what she had to do to get there."

1,STUPID GAME!,"This game is boring and dumb for players of any age. The camera angles are bad and the control is rough. Do not buy this PEICE OF JUNK WASTE OF MONEY! If you have money and can't wait to spend it, then go buy your self lunch. This game is a waste of money."
2,Not Worth Even $6.99,"There is nothing really wrong with this guide, except that it's a waste of money, even the $6.99 it cost to buy. If you've read the book or seen the movie, or both, then there is really nothing in this guide that will be useful. There is only one reason that this guide exists, and that is take another few bucks out of the pockets of Sideways fans. I should have paid attention to the other reviews that are saying the same thing I am. From this reader/reviewer's standpoint, there is no good reason for this guide to have been published."
3,Sideways Guide,A very thin book on the movie locations. Didn't provide too much info that you couldn't obtain from the movie.
5,"Fun booklet for ""Sideways"" fans","If you are a fan of the movie ""Sideways"" then this is a fun booklet to look into especially if you are planning to be in the area where the movie was filmed. I enjoyed reading it."
3,Was expecting a genuine carrier Filter,"I was expecting a genuine Carrier filter; the 2 pack I received did not appear to be genuine Carrier parts. There were no Carrier markings on the filters and the design was differnt than the Genuine one these replaced. I expected genuine filters since the AMAZON page read ""Other products by Carrier"" and ""Product Features: Carrier MACPAK16"". FYI I ordered the 16x25x5 MERV 8 Carrier Replacement Filter (2 Pack)."
1,Don't be fooled!!!,"These are NOT the genuine Carrier/Bryant filters, but a knock-off. These do not come with the foam sealing strip, which the Carrier filters do. I had to go to the hardware store to buy weatherstripping for this purpose. As a result, these filters and weatherstripping cost more than the genuine filters would have. However, these filters appear to be reasonably made. I will buy the ""real deal"" next time."
3,Not same quality as Carrier,"The accordion folds go lengthwise instead of horizontally, and I think that becomes a lot less material for the air to go through. Also the material seems thinner, so altogether I believe there is less filtration going on with this filter, although it does say MERV 11 vs the 8 for the Carrier ones. But given the low price, I'm keeping them. I'll just be extra diligent about replacing on schedule."
3,Merv 8 filbbcar0016,"I gave these three stars based just on price. I just ordered these today, I will update after I receive them. First to M Jones review, None of them come with the foam strip not even the $50+ Carrier filters. They have changed the part number and the new ones don't have the foam. To quote another website --------""This filter is currently being changed to a new part number. The new part number is FILXXCAR0016. The new filter comes with stick on labels to identify it as Carrier or Bryant. It is the same filter with a different part number. The part numbers FILCCCAR0016 and FILBBCAR0016 will no longer be available. This new part number does not come with foam strips.Replaces Carrier FILCCCAR0016Replaces Bryant FILBBCAR0016""I don't know why I guess to save money although you would think they would list foam strips right along with them."
3,Questionable Quality,"The filter framework is flimsy, but more importantly I'm not confident in the filter material itself. The quality just seems substandard. However, keep in mind that my judgement is based solely on a visual inspection.Having said that, I will not purchase this product again. It's just not worth the risk to my health and my furnace. I plan to replace these filters sooner than the recommended schedule."
5,A fraction of the cost,These are the same exact filters as the MERV that I purchased through the installer when I had my new system installed. These were a fraction of the cost that I paid through them. Plus saved on taxes and shipping!
1,Wrong item shipped,Received completely different product than the one pictured.The ones received are bearings with a cheetah print in a plastic box rather than the bearings in a Pig Tin as pictured!
3,Received bearings - different color than pictured,The bearings received were yellow cheetah print not pink as pictured.
4,A little light,I love Ovaltine and have loved it since childhood. Our local Pakistani version is much more concentrated than this English version. I think it is lighter but good if you drink it before sleeping.
3,it's lacking 3 melendys!,"This is the last of the melendy books I read; it it was ok. The mystery is great and puzzling but the disappointing thing is THERE's ONLY OLIVER AND RANDY IN IT!!! How can you have a melendy book less than half the melendys?! Also the prize at the end is sweet but disappointing, but overall... ok."
4,Great fun!,"Speed Stacking is great fun for kids who like to challenge themselves. I bought this for my 8yo son to play with at a homeschool co-op class. I might have overlooked how fun this could be until I saw all the kids having a BLAST racing the clock on stacking. Even my 3yo wants to play at stacking. It's worth it to get the timer, mat and instructional DVD, rather than cups alone. My only complaint was that this company took ages to ship this out to me; not sure if that is typical of them or not, but I had to borrow a set to use at our first class because my order had not arrived yet."
1,Won't fit 60GB Zen Vision,"This skin does not fit the Zen Vision 60GB. It's too small. Overtight fit causes havoc with the four pushbutton controls on the Zen. You can cut the sides of the skin to reduce pressure on the Zen, but this, of course, reduces the protection value of the skin considerably. My advice, don't buy it for a 60 GB Zen Vision."
5,Awesome,"I am so thrilled they did ""When The Children Cry""!White Lion should be very proud!The CD is awesome!!!!"
4,Overview of Theory of Myth,"This isn't a book about the world myths - religious or otherwise, it is a book about the theory and approach to understanding myth. If you go into this book with the latter expectation you will be satisfied. Segal gives a fairly short introduction to various theorists on myth, that offers a concise overview of modern ideas about the place of myth in human culture."
1,NOT a Slo-Mo ball,"It is a sturdy product, but not a true Slo-Mo brand ball - it is a Cando ball, much heavier and firmer, which makes it less useful for rehab/exercise purposes, when you want it only half-inflated and quite squashy."
2,"Quality material, shoddy construction, not evenly round","Ball is made of a very high quality rubber compound that is very tough and resistant, but construction is very poor. When the ball is inflated, you can see thick and thin streaks throughout the surface. Surface of the ball is rough, not smooth as it appears in the pictures. Very out of round, has ""flatter"" spots. Definitly would not purchase again."
5,authentic - but practical,"Brennan's recipes are delicious and authentic, but this book is much more than just recipes. There is plenty of background on the countries and their cuisines; a great glossary of asian ingredients; menu suggestions and index of dishes by country; and instructions how to substitute for the more esoteric ingredients. True, coconut milk and tamarind are not so hard to find anymore - but the substitutes are still more economical, and you're just as likely to already have them in your pantry. Most important are the spices, but once you stock up on those you're ready to go. Follow Brennan's istructions as closely as you can - and they are very clear and quite simple - and you will be assured authentic tastes and delicious results. I thoroughly enjoy this book, and highly recommend it."
1,Poor Quality - Poor Return Policy,"My second Maxtor One Touch II 300gb drive from just failed. The first died last October. I'm not getting a third Maxtor product.Aside from what appears to be poor manufacturing quality, Maxtor's customer service could stand a little upgrade, too.Here's what you have to do to get warranty service from Maxtor. You need a return merchandise authorization from Maxtor. You have to ship the drive back to Maxtor at your cost. They will then send you a replacement unit. You can get a new unit before giving up your failed drive, but you have to give them your credit card number and they will charge you if you don't ship back the defective drive within 30 days.I'm done with Maxtor. I suggest you look elsewhere, too."
1,Maxtor - Very Poor Customer Support - Warning,"This is a comment about Maxtor that applies to all models of external hard drives.About 5 years ago, I bought a Maxtor FireWire 80GB drive when it was a new and expensive item. I then bought a PC laptop that it did not work with. Customer ""support"" told me that it will not work with some computers. Period.Now I discovered that I lost the (non-standard) power cord while moving. I figured that the company would charge an outrageous price for a replacement, but was shocked when they told me that they do not have a replacement. Furthermore, they were not able to provide me with a technical description of the cord so that I could try to buy it elsewhere. They were able to tell me that no current models use the same cord, however.I bought this drive for long-term storage/backup. I paid a lot for it, and now I'm left checking eBay every week so that I can buy an entire used drive--just for the power cord. I will not buy another Maxtor product."
3,Does not work w/XP sp2,I have two of these drives They are both stable and cool to the touch. They work well with USB 2.0 but do not work with firewire. Both loose connectivity after a few hours and will not come back until you cycle power on the drives. The FW800 interface is very fast when it works but I'm afraid it will damage my data. THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH XP & SERVICE PACK 2 NOT MAXTOR. A hot fix is available from Microsoft but it did not work for me. I gave it a three based soley on the Microsoft issue not the drive.
3,"Good on Mac, bad on PC","I bought this as a backup device for a Win 2000 system - Unbelievably difficult to install. I ended up formatting it as a FAT32 volume on a Mac, attaching it to the windows system, reformatting as an NTFS and then backing things up.Things went fine for a few days until I came in this morning to the ""New Hardware Wizard"" (why do PCs need wizards to configure things? must be due to their inherent geekiness).Unmounted the drive and attached to a Mac - everything is fine. Just needs to be reformatted again to be seen as a PC volume.It's possible that my problems are related to the fact that I feel that Windows is a dismal operating system for the 21st century, given that it is inherently rooted in DOS, but this is the first drive that I've had these sorts of headaches with. We actually have a hardware/software serice contract with our vendor for our enterprise software - they seem as clueless as I am, although they are just as capable as I am of reformatting the drive."
5,A Great Compilation,"I'm a huge Screeching Weasel fan, and this compilation sums up what I love most about the band. Sure, some of my favorite songs are missing, but most of them are right here. A great summation of the 10+ years in which this group wrote the rules for all other punk/ pop bands to follow. Remember to say thank you, Green Day."
2,Book,One-sided reporting. Doesn't give true accounts and records of the rise and accounts of female offenders. Look for government research on internet for more accurate information.
4,Conga Virtuoso Relived!,I bought the first tape with Giovanni and Changuito and Giovanni played the congas only! Changuito was on timbale and together made the ultimate in drumming harmony and history! Giovanni played HIS HEART OUT ( I would say his a** off) but that isn't appropriate here. Changuito was superb on the timbale! Changuito! The master teaching the teacher!
5,One of the best sequels I've ever read!,"Anne Bishop has done it again. Daughter of the Blood was a lot to live up to, but I wasn't the least bit disappointed. It's a bit more confusing than Daughter, and a lot of new characters are introduced, but it's easy to catch on to. I just hope Ms.Bishop will hurry up with the next one!"
4,Another incredible page turner by Anne Bishop!,"I thought that Heir to the Shadows was as good if not better than Daughter of The Blood. It was a great read and I can't wait till the third book comes out. I think Ms. Bishop is a great storyteller, although a somewhat awkward writer. I wish she could learn to use a few more adjectives besides ""midnight"" and that she would give us more than just barebones descriptions of each character. However, it's definitely a quite different fantasy book than most of the others out there and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes dark fantasy."
4,Enchanting but not as good as the first,Heir to the shadows was a much awaited book. I read it very quickly and was impressed with the story line and how it focused on Lucivar and Surreal. I was disappointed that Daemon didn't play much of a part in the book but hopefully he will be mentioned more in the sequel. I cannot wait to read the sequel and am very unimpressed that I have to wait a year to read it. Hopefully it will be more like the first book.
4,Dark characters and intriguing plots!,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and although it is rather overshadowed by Daughter, it is nevertheless a near-masterpiece. Mrs. Bishop's caste of characters, who are sympathetic without being composed of the classic hero combination of ""sweetness and light"" are an absolute delight to get to know. I would have liked for Daemon to play a greater role in the plot, but the substitution of Lucivar is more than acceptable. If Queen is up to the standard of these two books, we can surely expect to be seeing Anne Bishop's new works on all of our ""Favorite Books"" lists!"
4,Entertaining but...,"I was taken aback by how the author's writing style altered so. So this isn't as fun to read as the first book, Daughter of the Blood, but it's still quite good.I suggest CROWN DUEL and COURT DUEL by Sherwood Smith. Splendid stuff. Rather similar to thus."
2,Why are the good guys so unbelievable stupid?,I'm giving up on reading this book - and the main reason is that the good guys just are too stupid (when that serves to prolong the story) and don't work together/help each other enough.
5,can't wait,"if you've read ""DAUGHTER OF THE BLOOD"" and it left you hanging- you are going to love this book- so many stories in a story. I wouldn't recommend them (black jewel trilogy)for children under age thirteen simply because there are some sexual parts in the books. Also, the sellers i purchased these from are great - I bought these from amazon and they all arrived in great condition and cheaper(even with shipping) than the ones at the used book store."
4,#2 just aren't as good,"Have you ever noticed that the ""second"" in any series is usually not as good as either the ""first"" or the ""third""? It is the same with this series by Anne Bishop. The negativity of the society, the hostility between men and women, all of this is cranked up in the second book. The characters seem more disjointed, more confused -- and well they could be given what has happened and is happening to them. I just didn't get as into the characters as the first or third book enticed me to be. The third book however will make little sense without the second so you should read it if you are a fan of the series. Indeed if you plan to read ""The Invisible Ring"" I recommend the trilogy first because it will explain the culture better and allow you to be more a part of that adverture."
2,Mildly disappointing....,"I loved Daughter of the Blood, read it over and over (well, certain passages, at least) and have been eager and waiting the next. The day I got it, I read it in its entirety and found myself very disappointed. The characters seem to lose who they were and become an entirely different person, the whole book could be tightened up significantly, a lot of loose ends go no where. I find myself hoping for the final book to prove to myself that this second book was just a mistake - just Anne Bishop trying to turn in something from the deadline. Bottom line: Read Daughter of the Blood again if you want a truly good read."
5,book 2,Continues the story of Jaenelle from book 1 and includes all of the wonderful characters that love and care for her as well as her enemies. One of the best stories I have read in years. Anne Bishop has created a world and people I enjoy visiting and getting to know.
5,great,Anne Bishop is such an amazing author! She makes the story come to life and I wish her stories would go on forever! These are all a must read!
4,A Great follow-up to the first book,"I liked this book a lot. This series is so different from some of the others that I have read. I loved the transformation Jaenelle took throughout the book and how she finally realized that in order to save those she loves, she has to do things she really didn't want to do.This book had much more of Lucivar in it, which I liked. The addition of the coven and the ""boyos"" was good. They made the book entertaining to read.Personally, I get a kick out of the names in this book. They are just a little out of the norm, usually by just one letter. It makes it much more interesting to read. The last chapter was a perfect beginning to the next book, which I hope to read soon."
5,Just Keeps Getting Better!,"After I read the first book in the series, I picked up this one one as soon as I could make it to a book store. The second book picks up the story of Jaenelle, Saetan, and his sons, Daemon and Lucivar. Jaenelle is no longer a sweet, innocent child, but a young woman racked with inner turmoil. Her mind and her body are still fragile and amnesia shadows the traumatic events that occured. Daemon is trapped in the Twisted Kingdom and can no longer come to her aid. Lucivar is convinced that she is dead and that Daemon was the one to kill her. And the three Realms are enveloped in ever increasing stife as Hekatah and Dorothae weave their intricate schemes to rule Kaeleer.Bishop's books are dark, hard, frightening and grotesque. But they are also light, beautiful, funny, and heart-warming. She brings her characters to life and their problems become your own. I can't remember the last time I got so caught up in a world."
4,THE OTHERSIDE OF THE TRIANGLE,"Outstanding book! I enjoyed ""watching"" Lucivar become a big brother to Jaenelle. There were sections where I laughed, cheered and cried. Book one introduced the Father/Mirror and Consort while this one brought into focus the other side of the triangle, Brother and Father. I especially liked Karla-Kiss, Kiss- and all the other friends of Witch. Who would've thought that the High Lord of Hell would have a housefull of children, who call him either Uncle Saetan or Papa High Lord, and enjoy it?"
5,Breath Taking,"I loved this the second installment of the Blood Jewels Trilogy. I couldn't put it down. What I found the most fascinating in this book was the relationship between Jaenelle and Lucivar. Here is this warrior who is worked unto death, who wants all the pain and hurt and anger to end and yet this one girl saves him and they are what siblings are supposed to be. I loved this book from start to finish."
5,A truly brilliant piece of work!!!,"So far I have read both books, and I have loved them both very much and cannot WAIT until Queen...comes out. For those who are mad that there wasn't much of the Sadist in the sequel is because it focused more on Lucivar, just like you read more about Daemon in the first book the second one was more on Lucivar. I think that the sequel was just as good as the first. It continues the story which I have throughly read again and again, until Heir came out. If you like gothic science fiction then you'll love this book. This book will grab you and won't let go till you finish."
4,It was an o.k. book,"This book was good, I mean I read in about a day, it really gripped me, however it skipped around too much. Pointless things happened in the book like that battle against the Jhinkas, there was no point to that. And Janelle has soooo many friend, you can't keep track of them all. But never the less, I liked the book and I can't wait for Queen of the Darkness."
5,Its the middle chapter of a story,"I know lots of people are upset that this book is ""not as good as Daughter ofthe Blood"" but everyone has to remember... this is the middle of the story. Instead of looking at the books as single novels... see them as installments of a LARGER novel. :)"
5,I can't wait for Queen of the Darkness!,"I loved this book! I can't wait for Queen of the Darkness! I love Bishop's detail on the characters! The ending is so shocking and I can't wait to hear more of Deamon, Luicvar, Jaenell and Saeten! I think this is a awesome book and people should read it!"
5,i'd give it 200 stars if i could!,"ok here I am, back again, i've read the book and ok it is perfect! Anne Bishop has got to be the best writer of all time! I've been wanting to know more about Luciver and i finally got the chance! and... oops can't give away the book, but the book ends the worst way! well i mean it's a wonderful way but it's realy annoying because it's cliffhanger type. but still when i get the third book i'll do what i did when i got this one get down on my knees thank god for getting the book to be so fast run to my room and read it about 20 times! Sooo basically I am telling all of you to go out there and read this book, and that means the entire trilogy as soon as you can!"
4,A nice middle book,"I truly enjoy Daughter of the Blood. Yes it's lighter than the first book, but it's a welcome break from all the ""uncle"" plot. Daemon is missing, but you get to know Lucivar and Saetan. It does a good job setting up the last book.Now it has much have gore or angst as the other two books but it ups fill in the reletionships needed for the ""queen"". It worth the read, I know. My copy is falling apart."
4,something gothic,"when i first heard about the book being one that touches on the dark side, i was quite apprehensive about it, because how many people actually have heros called Daemon, Lucivar or Saetan for that matter. but once i got my hands on the first book i was hooked and the second book finally revealed who Lorn was.truly riverting and gripping, a page-turner and i can't wait for the last book. but one thing puzzles me though, what's the chalice got to do with the whole story? is it a representation of the magic, ot sanity of a person? good job anyhow!"
3,Fun but where's the plot?,"Well, I am kind of disappointed with the plot of the book. It basically just chronicles the coming of age for Jaenelle and a showpiece for Anne Bishop's humour. However while it may be funny it seems at odds with the original dark tone of the first book. The plot goes nowhere except for hints of Daemon's return and Jaenelle's taking of power. The political intrigue is clumsily done and whatever evil plots were hatched were cursory described and ditched in favour of humour. It only starts to pick up at the end but only at the end! To be fair, maybe the third book might just be all too dark and the second book is just to prepare us for it. In any case, the book is fun to read on a lazy Sunday afternoon but definitely not as addictive as the first."
4,Very dark but somehow addictive,"WARNING: Oodles of strong sexual content. And yet, very little actual sex. Just a lot of very explicit and demeaning talk of sex slaves that really has nothing to do with the plot and does nothing to enrich the story. Without that irrelevant and unnecessary element, this would easily be a 5 star series among the most original and most addictive trilogies out there."
4,The Tranie crisis,"I was on my way home from school, and as I was accelerating, I felt the front-end shutter, and when the shuttering had ended the car would not budge. The mechanic said that I would need another transition in the car. It would cost me $2,300 to fix the problem. I had no choice but pay the man. I found out later that this was a common thing for the 92' mercury sable. If you have any information about a recall on this please let me know... Thanks"
3,It's ok,"It has a few really good songs, but overall not worth buying if you could find them separately to download. One thing I really didn't like is on one of the songs they have a cuss word so they bleep it out, but obviously the people making the cd have no clue how to do it. When the part comes on it's this loud annoying tone, but actually does it a little to late or early (can't remember while I writing this). But bleeping out words that didn't need to be. It's ridiculous, I would have been ok with them just leaving them in."
4,Informative but impractical,"I enjoyed the subject matter immensely. Segal's idea of living a simple, graceful life is one that does have merit. I read this book because I am fortunate enough to be in the position to live this lifestyle. (single and financially secure). However, and unfortunately so, the U.S. is only interested in globalizing its economy. Shortened work weeks, and free university tuition would never receive political support. Segal's ideas are too utopianistic to be given any consideration in a country so set in its capitalistic ways."
5,Unexpectedly Great,"I picked up this album at a local record shop on a whim based on other gems that the Norton label has been putting out on vinyl. This ""greatest hits"" album consisting of 4 songs is admittedly short but still amazing for what it is. Its pure garage rock at its finest. No pretense no polish just good music."
2,Missing Parts,"There is nothing more irritating than opening the box and not having all the parts. I received duplicates of some and others just were not there. Called the company, they indicated that they would send out immediately and I would receive in ""5-7"" business days. It has been 6 and I am still waiting."
1,Didnt work,"Received ite, had it installed and it does not work. Installation company was going to charge us an additional fee to have it removed."
3,Door opener,I cannot accurately rate this item for the reason that it could not be installed for the reason there was not enough mounting space to be installed according to the man that was to do the job. So it is still in the original packaging never unpacked.
5,garage,"I haven't install it yet, but I do trust a lot in the chamberlain products so, It will be ok, It work perfect would buy again from this seller"
5,What a great opener!,"I purchased this for our home we bought as a foreclosure. I read the reviews, and was not sure if I should buy this. This system has held up great. It is not that loud as some of the reviews state. It is not a whisper model by any means, but gets the job done. The only issue I have had is when the sun hits the sensors just right the garage door will not close unless you hold the button the entire time. But mostly, the sun is due to where my house sits and lack of shrubs in the lawn."
4,garage door opener,"Having done numerous repairs to my 15 year old Liftmaster, I found the price for complete unit is as economical and easy to install as if purchasing spare parts."
4,austinyp,This opener is very good for its price and installation present no problem for most handy people. Its as good as the Sears craftsman model which I installed 20 years ago on the other garage door.
5,Garage door opener,"Arrived very quickly, used one night to assemble the track actuator etc. in the house, second night to hang the entire assembly, very easy to complete the installation and all features work very well."
4,Great replacement garage door opener,"I needed a replacement for the Sears Lift-Master that broke the sprocket off. It took my just over 1 hr to remove the old one and replace it with the Chamberlain. Half of that time was trying to untwist the chain. Once I got everything hooked up, I plug it in and it worked like a charm. (only had to do some adjustments to the door lift controls) If you need to replace a your current garage door opener, you can beat the price and the easy insulation of the Chamberlain CG40D."
3,Would have been 5 stars if all the parts were in the box,"This is a good, economical unit; however, it was incomplete (2 critical parts missing from the box). I was able to get the missing parts shipped to me within a week from the state (AZ) next door. Installation was not hard, but 2 people are required. I've had it in operation for 2 weeks, and it works very well. I would recommend it. Do note, however, that it only comes with 1 remote, which works fine for me."
1,not worth it,"I purchased this about 18 months ago and had my first problem about 6 months ago. The opener would not close and went back up and the lights flashed. There was nothing in the way. I found out the sensors were misaligned. About 3 months after after fixing this problem the door stopped working with the wall button. I contacted customer support by email and received a reply asking for more information about 3 weeks later. I also received an email that stated since we have received no response from you we assume the problem was taken care of. These 2 emails came on the same day. Now I have 2 problems. the door does not always go down, same as before, sensors are aligned, and the door does not always work with the wall button. Unless you want to wait in your driveway to see if the door goes all the way down I would not advise buying this opener. I am going to upgrade to a Whisper Deluxe and hopefully have beter results."
4,Nice Buy,This is a nice garage door opener. It was easy to install and I did it myself. I like it that the opener is quiet even though it is chain drive. The purchase would have been perfect if the opener came with 2 remotes.I would recommend this product to my friends and anyone considering it.
4,great quality for the price.,"My wife talked me into buying this unit because of the price. I was skeptical about it because of the price but I am very satisfied with it. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the more expensive ones do, but I realized that I didn't need them. It's quiet and the remote's range is terrific. I recommend this opener if you don't need to have the latest and greatest advancements in openers."
4,Chamberlain GDO,"Couldn't be happier with the garage door opener, only problem I have is there was only one remote included, the instructions for putting it together was a little vague, had I not had some previous experience with putting one together I think I would have had to hire an experienced installer. The remote works about a 1/4 of a block away this is and improvement over the old one. The seller was great and it shipped just when they said it would, I'd definitely order from them again. The only other problem we live in a plat I think the fact that it works at a longer distances creates a problem sometimes; in that maybe another person in our neighborhood also has this same GDO and is on the same channel (radio signal)because every once in a while the door starts to close and then Mal-functions and I have to get out of the car and close it manually using the door button and I have to hold the button until the door is all the way down"
5,Chamberlain Garage Door Opener,Fantastic value priced garage door opener. Well built & easy to install. Liftmaster/Chamberlain are the only brand openers I care to own. Very reliable!
2,Parts missing,"Great price and delivery. Unfortunately the ""U-Bracket"" was missing from the parts and am still waiting on a resolution to this problem. Upon checking other reviews I found this to be a similar situation to what others have experienced. Would not buy again."
2,Way to noisy,I had a Liftmaster that failed. This looked like a direct replacement. It was virtually identical except it's WAY louder than the Liftmaster. I've looked at it and it appears to be the motor and/or how the motor is mounted. I guess it works well but WOW. I would have picked a different model had I known the racket this bugger would make.
3,"The definition of ""mediocre""","I have been a Clapton fan for several years, but I only recently bought a copy of Slowhand, widely considered to be one of Clapton's best solo records. I, however, fail to see the big deal: Outside of Cocaine, Lay Down Sally and The Core there really isn't much of interest here. Wonderful Tonight was the fourth hit, but I always found it to be a bore. The same can be said for Next Time You See Her, We're All the Way and Peaches & Deisel. I guess Mean Old Frisco and Next Time You See Her are decent tunes, but this is too much of a soft-rock album for me.If you want good Clapton, get Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, Wheels of Fire, Layla, Blind Faith, 461 Ocean Blvd., Unplugged or the B.B. King duets album. Steer away from this one!"
3,Eric Clapton's 1977 Album Is Mostly Laid Back Material.,"I am a fan of Eric's 1970s recordings and Slowhand includes one of his greatest, the slow ballard Wonderful Tonight, in which the lyrics just flow with genuine affection.Lay Down Sally is another good one, this time with a touch of reggae.Some of the rest are not so much to my taste, although the instrumental Peaches And Diesel is OK.Clapton fans who want not only his well known hits should give this one a try."
4,We're all the way...,"Many women (and men) purchase this cd for Wonderful Tonight. However, I suggest that if you are looking for a love song, that you skip down a few tracks to We're All the Way. It was our wedding song and everyone asked where it came from. It was great! This is classic 70's Clapton. Need we say more??"
5,SACD review,"After waiting through the bizarre back order situation that accompanied the release of ""Slowhand,"" when the SACD did finally arrive it was worth it.I do not have the original CD or vinyl version of the album, so I cannot make a comparison to the sound quality between the two, but I can say that the surround mix done by Glyn Johns (also the producer of the original) is outstanding and very creative.The best example comes from 'The Core,' where the surround channels contain the back beat, creating a cool point/counterpoint between the front and rears that really adds to the listening experience.Other highlights are the atmospheric keyboards in 'Wonderful Tonight' and others. Just an overall great effort."
4,A PLEASURE,"Pleasure to listen, Calpton's band is amazing here, including bass player Radle (RIP) and drummer Oldaker. All the eight songs are killers, a pleasure to listen, alternating slightly between straight rock, blues, country and pop, but always played spontaneoulsy and without commercialism. Perfetc album."
5,Clapton is amazing....,"This album front to back for anyone who loves great music is a classic - Slowhand has it all - Slower melodic tunes and faster Clapton classics like ""Cocaine"" and the amazing ""The Core"" are great - The latter song, in my opinion is one of Clapton's best pieces - Written and sung with the amazing Marcy Levy, the song is just spin tingling kick butt rock and roll, with Clapton ripping the strings off of his Stratocaster - One of the more underrated albums of all time - This record is a masterpiece....."
3,Great music - above average recording,"Every track on this disc with the exception of Cocaine sounds amazing. Something about that recording, it just sounds muffled to me. Still a great song and the rest of the clarity on the disc makes this a must own for any SACD fan. I just wish Cocaine sounded as good as the rest of the album."
4,The New Testament,"When you approach this album you must already be an avid Clapton fan who wants to further explore his music. With the exception of Cocaine here we get emotion over power. There are definite examples of superior musicianship but Clapton evolves his music for purer style. Less fireworks here. If you want to see what the greatest guitarist ever does when he matures then you gotta check this out.Honestly, even without the sonic craziness Clapton still floored me here. The opening track rocks, even got my rap music friends to know the name of Clapton. The rest definitely would not have jived with people who can't appreciate anything that isn't drumrolls, guitar solos, and all fireworks."
5,Slowhand,"Love Eric Clapton, this album is pretty good like the first disc the best.Great to listen in the car when they are playing junk on the radio."
4,great Cd for the completest,"I have not heard much about the songs that have been added. As far as I am concerned any recordings of EC are welcome no matter what tour they are from. I saw EC on his Slowhand. Tour in 1977. As I recall he did almost the entire Cd that night. It would have been nice to see these Live recordings included. It would have been a much better set. Along with Layla, Disraeli Gears and Wheels of fire this remains one of my favorite albums of Eric Claptons carreer. A MUST for any EC fan"
5,Aewsom,I loved the remaster.It was like hearing Slowhand for the first time.I can hear the difrence from the original.I would tell Eric Claptin Fans this should be in their collection.
2,Not what I expected - but I did not know what to expect,"First Clapton CD I bought. I guess I did not realize what I would be hearing. I will admit I wanted to hear some of the popular songs that he put out more recently, and I think this is some of his early work. If you are a real fan of R&B you might like this."
2,Clapton's much overrated record,"Although by many regarded as his finest moment since the soft-hearted, male-sobbing, group therapeutic ""Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs"", Clapton's reputation as guitar hero overshadows the fact that this album actually is quite boring. The floppy ""Wonderful Tonight"" is long overdue in pathos. ""Cocaine"" is a Cale rip-off, and sustains it's greatness only in Clapton's stunning live performances - not his dull studio work. The appaling ""Lay down Sally"" (written by later Shakespear's Sister Marcella Detroit, who luckily matured into a great songwriter) ompa-pa's itself into sheer boredom. ""Mean Old Frisco"" and ""Peaches and Diesel"" is by far the album's greatest tracks. Clapton's greatness is as a live performer. His studio albums haven't worked since The Bluesbreakers period."
3,only 1 song makes the CD,"The case was all broken up, the CD was ok, there is only one song on the CD that is any good."
2,very slow.....and...boring!,"I don't understand why many people entitle this album: ""the best of Eric Clapton"".For me,Slowhand is simply a ""flat"" album.....If you want the best Clapton's albuns, buy the following:Eric ClaptonLive -The Rainbow ConcertThere's one in every CrowdMoney and CigarettesBehind the SunJourneymanlive-24 nightsPilgrimRushOne more car, one more rider.layla"
4,Eric Clapton SLOWHAND,"Great Album, Great artist. The only issue I have is if I wanted to hear some bimbo yelling out a song I would have purchased her album."
4,Mr Slowhand,"Very nice album from Mr. Slowhand. The ""Cocaine"" version is really great and the SACD quality is here !!!! And ""Lay down Sally"" is a very cool song too."
2,"Super deluxe has very weird packaging, be careful opening it","My box literally fell apart when I was opening it! I hope this isn't another debacle like the Layla 40th anniversary boxed set. The contents slide out, but not completely. There are three sleeves containing the book, programs and LP. The other discs are securely in the side of the sleeves. All were in the right place, no free floaters or glue residue, so that's been fixed at least! HOWEVER, one of the sleeves FELL OUT! Complete with a nasty glue edge waiting to muck up whatever it touched! Unacceptable. I hope I just got a defective one (contacting amazon for a replacent, and I'd it's the same story I'll just get a refund), and this isn't indicative of the manufacturing process.The good news is that the DVD-A sounds fantastic, nice imaging and detail. Can't wait to compare the LP to the MFSL one:)If the next box is ok I'll go to 3.5 stars."
3,Rail Map of Europe,"Map is fine unless your going to Eastern Europe, which is completely masked by an inset of Sweden and Finland. Apparently Publisher does not plan to go east anytime soon."
2,Rail Map of Europe...not so helpful,This map did not provide me with th information I needed to plan a rail trip in Europe. It was very general and did not provide any references to obtain specific information on train schedules.
1,Very disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed that this test was not accurate. I followed the directions perfectly - twice. I am a well educated woman who needed to do a prescreen before employment. I know for a fact that it is not accurate because I came up negative in all panels and should not have on opiates. I say this because I am taking opiates currently, and am wearing a patch, so I should of tested positive on opiates, if the test were accurate. Believe me I wanted it to be, for now I have to pay $90.00 at a lab.truly disappointed!This is surely a case where you get what you pay for. I thought this was too good to be true and it was."
3,Piece of Mind?,"I bought this as a ScOnE baker, not a pie cutter. You simply pat the dough into a flat round loaf, press the cutter down into it (greased and floured, of course), and bake with it intact. While pretty good for this odd category--baking powder scones have just the right degree of separation to prevent DrYNESS, the edges look hearth-baked, and you can't beat the low price--I wouldn't recommend it for use around children or anyone physically impaired, even for pies: the serrated spokes are as sharp as a Skil Saw's. I suppose this is to defeat any thick, leathery homemade crust, but you can easily nick your fingers handling it, as I have. It should come with a protective box you can store it in, like knives do, since it won't fit in the package it comes in after assembly. However, if you acquire a fondness for the little monster, it does come in different sizes; you can find it with seven, eight, or more sections. This one has six, for a rather hefty piece of pie or scone."
4,Klaatu Sunset,"Covers the whole spectrum of Klaatu recordings frombeginning to end. For You Girl a former b-side showsup for the first time on cd. This, and the unreleasedThere's Something Happening are great tracks thatshow the bands range of sounds.There are so many differences on these songs thatit's sure to please ANY die-hard Klaatu fan. Keep inmind that these are not always the best versions ofthese tunes, but you'll always enjoy their differences.I really enjoyed it."
3,not worth the wait,"Im a huge klaatu fan, i remember staying up late to listen to there debut album on the radio. The songs on this set sound like they re-recorded every song. The vocals sound nothing like the originals. Any effect that was used back then is now gone. there is no dynamics at all. If you hav'nt heard the originals then your fine. but for a fan. save your money"
5,An Awesome Book,"This was an incredible and inspiring book. Some of the stories in here you will never forget. You'll hear of how God can make huge miracles out of missed flights, out of caring for your enemy, and many other things. You'll realize that in all situations there can be many blessings and many opportunities if you're open to it. Every day, we pass up so many chances to help others and to share the gospel with them. Have you ever seen a hitchhiker on the road and justkept going? Or kept walking past a crying person in the airport? Have you ever seen a fellow Christian go astray but were afraid to say anything? The people in this book don't pass up those opportunities, and their stories will amaze you. You will be astounded at the courage and the love displayed by the people in the book. It's a very powerful book and I strongly recommend it for anyone and everyone. Being more in touch with God's will for our lives is something we all need."
5,Wow! The true life examples will knock your socks off!,"Franklin's writing style is simple and to the point. Rather than clever writing, he uses examples of real life people ""on overdrive"" for God that have made and are making tremendous impacts for the Kingdom. An inspring book for anyone asking ""Is this all there is to Christianity?""."
1,disappointed,"When I bought STLJ I had high hopes. Everyone seems to give them high reviews, but I was very disappointed. It was very noisy, I guess that's the only way I can describe it. There is a sax, which I thought would be interesting, but it turned out to be screechy and annoying. I would not recommend this cd."
4,Huh?,"I read this book, ( ). But it's a pretty good book. I justpicked it up one day and started reading, and once I did, I couldn'tput it down. I woud recommend it to anyone over 12. END"
4,Don't jugde a book by its cover,Silver is a good book for young adults. This book talks about a young girl who's mom is a house keeper. She goes to a new Middle school where the rich kids go to. At first she feels uncomfortable at the school she attends because she didn't know nobody there but then she starts getting friends. Frinds that have painful secrets. This book is about how teenagers help each other in different situations. As a 15 year old I feel that this book was for younger girls than 15 but it really was interesting.
5,Exceptionally Good Wall Mount,"I purchased the Peerless PLA60-UNL(P) Universal Articulating Wall Mount for 37"" to 60"" Displays (Black) to hang my 58"" Plasma TV and couldn't be happier. It arrived in 5 days, was double boxed, and I paid no shipping fees. Watching TV has never been more enjoyable."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I had read that it was better than the ""Cool Boarders"" series, but I disagree. The grabs are simply too easy to pull off, and there is'nt very much variety in the tricks. Although--if you can qualify, and do tha MTV challenge, that can provide some fun (easy fun, but fun), and then the Alaska course is good too. It's a nice change from the CB series, but about half as good, maybe."
4,"Pretty good, but definately not her best","I admit it was kinda hard to get through the beginning and parts of the middle, with all the battles going on and wondering why. I wish the character of Anne was brought more to life and included more in the story. And I never really understood why Margaret was so hateful towards everyone in the family? I love all Henley's books, she is a very talented writer. Raven and the Rose and Falcon and the Flower are still my favorites by far."
1,Awful!!,"It amazes me that this book was even published. Henley will start to show promise by showing some flavor of the period, via descriptions of the town and castles and political tidbits. But then her characters will speak using today's language. And the cliches! There must be one on every page. She also jumps around too much. A single scene could be only a paragraph, then she's onto something else, switching point of views, etc. It's difficult to follow. Tabby is a flat, boring character. But Rogue I did like. He's a strong, dynamic character, even if his actions and motives aren't quite clear. I bought this book because the premise is promising. So much could have been done with this! But this reads like a rough first draft, a skeletal sketch of the story. Overall, VERY disappointing."
4,Back in Terrapin.,"If you are new to the Dead I would not recommendthat you buy this album(go for Workingmans Dead or American Beauty or Skull and Roses) but if your a huge Deadhead I highly recommend this album. This album has some of their best like Estimated Prophet and the hugh sixteen minute Terapin Station Suite. The bonus materials are only okay though. Sure it has Phils extremly rare song Equinox, but through out the whole song there is alot of static. The bonus track Fire on the Mountain is the standout bonus track because the lyrics are different from the one on Shakedown St., but sadly Jerrys voice at somepoints is unaudible. Buy this album for the original album not for the bonus tracks."
3,A last something from a great group,"The first LP from ex Small Factory members Phoebe and Alex ""Songs for T.V. Stars"" is that excellent transition album where some forces emerge from an earlier powerful incarnation to produce musical magic. It is a wonderful morphology. If you like Small Factory get it - no doubt. This follow up EP was fun to get because of all the nostalgia I have for S.F., but It lacks the power to keep. Tracks 1 & 2 you can pretty much skip. 3 - 6 are all good songs, sometimes very beautiful as in the title track, but still won't keep you coming back. Shark Shaped Ship is kind of clever (and enigmatic in its death theme)and persuasive but winds up overdone. For God's sake buy any S.F. or Godrays album you can find, but maybe not this one. BTW there was a Small Factory reunion show recently and these guys were great. They definitely still have it. Don't let the chance slip to hear them if they (please) come around again."
3,Not what I expected,This ribbon does help to make prints with the Primera Signature Z1 but it definitely does not make 200 prints. I got up to 50 when I had to replace one. Other than that great quality prints.
4,sweet dreams,"Good sheets sleep like a baby.... recommend it, bought it for my girlfriend and she stopped snoring... now she sleeps on them with her new husband :("
1,Doesn't work - bad support,"The digital audio produced no sound. After 4 hours with tech support, we gave up. It has yet to successfully burn a dvd using HP media. It would crash with a BSOD every 15 minutes. Tech support had me reformat the disks, but the recovery CD failed to reinstall anything. I've been going back and forth with them for a month now while my laptop sits there dead."
1,WIRELESS FAILURE!,I purchased two of these. Both lost wireless within the first 3 months. I cannot recommend this style of HP. I have a compaq for 3 years and have warn the keys smooth. Wireless works great on this one!
3,When I was a kid I thought it was good,"When I first saw this money when I was in middle school or something I thought it was really good. It's still a good flick but more because it's just funny. Vladimir is just hilarious to me now and I can't see how any grown man takes him seriously. I love how he has barbells under his bed so he can get some curls in after he shoots up -- ""No problem!"" Personally I didn't like the game scenes but I'm pretty picky -- I did not think they were choregraphed well so if you watch/play a lot of football Omar Epps looks like a pretty bad running back. Other funny moments: Michigans quarterback after they win, ""place at the table"", just about the whole movie actually. Also the obligatory quarterback-throwback-pass confuses the defense, as usual -- they must not watch football movies! Still that said, it's a good flick, pretty exciting, and most people will like it."
3,realistic look at high pressure college football,"if you are a college football fan, you should like this film, due to the subject matter and also the realistic look at the pressure of ""winning"" at a top tier college football program.several subjects are covered- relationships (both coach / athlete and athlete / girlfriend), doping, job security, money in sports, and politics are covered in this film.enjoy watching this during the off-season."
3,By the book,"Gee, a bad boy quarterback, meathead lineman, some girl who inspires a guy to do better with his life, and a not always ethical coach. The creativity of this sports drama knows absolutely no bounds. Looking for the infamous scene where the players lie in the middle of the highway.... sorry, they cut that out. What we're left with is a vapid sports drama that has nothing really new to say.I will give it three stars for the fact that it's still pretty well exceuted, and the personality of the head coach in dealing with the players is entertaining to watch. I was entertained, which was all I wanted on a relaxed Sunday afternoon, but there is a lot better out there. Friday Night Lights was much more real and gritty, and Rudy much more inspriational."
4,Great Movie For Football Fans,This is an excellent movie for football fans. It is the most realistic football movie I have seen. The Program is a most believable depiction of college football and college life for the players. I played college football and feel that I am hard to impress as far as football movies go. The Program impressed me!
3,Not bad at all.,"I never thought I'd watch a movie about jocks (I'd rather just watch them play) and enjoy it. But ""The Program"" wasn't so much about jocks, per se, as about *people*...with very realistic hopes, fears, dreams and failings.Plus, a certain 6'7"" Hoosier proves that he's under-rated...by *singing,* and doing a good job of it.Here's to the release of a DVD version; hopefully, complete with the controversial deleted scenes. Us movie buffs should not have to suffer for the irresponsibility of others."
3,UNFAIR TO MOVIE COLLECTORS,"YES, I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY A SPECIFIC SCENE WAS REMOVED BUT I THINK MOVIE COLLECTORS SUCH AS MYSELF SHOULD HAVE A CHANCEOF OWNING THE MOVIE WITHOUT BEING ""CUTOUT,"" IF THERE IS A VIDEOWITHOUT THE PART BEING REMOVED, PLEASE LET ME KNOW"
1,WOULD NOT RUN ON VISTA,"The MOST important part of ANY review of a game IS...will it PLAY on the system you have! My answer here is NO. I got a nifty poster and RED SIEGE dog tag with chain but can't get it to run on VISTA, even trying to run it under previous operating systems that PCs these days say you can do by choosing on the submenu. Just won't run. Waaaaaah."
2,A superficial RTS,"Real time without much strategy. But the in-game videos are nice if you are impressed with eye candy. Otherwise, a relatively mindless RTS. Ugh!No editor is another major down."
3,My thoughts,"This is a very nice book very informative but more what makes up ASL than how to sign ASL. So if you're looking for what makes up ASL this is your book, but if you're looking for how to form complex sentences and how words inflect this isn't it. But I supposed that's my fault for assuming linguistics=syntax. :D"
4,Advanced ASL Syntax and Structure Book - Not For Beginners,"The Linguistics of American Sign Language explains the morphology and syntax of ASL, not so much the 'how' as the 'why.' This book is useful for the advanced student of ASL, but not particularly helpful for a beginner. The authors, all current or former professors at Gallaudet University, explain in great detail the nuances of American Sign Language."
2,Not the best investment,"At the moment, there are two main contenders on the market with comparable books on West Africa: Rough Guide and Lonely Planet. Neither is perfect.Rough Guide may feel a bit more professionally-made, and has been made on a bigger budget too, but it suffers from terminally boring writing style.I said this before and I`ll say it again: if people who write guidance for your tax returns were to write guidebooks they would probably come up with similarly uninspired language.The book does not offer the same level of self-righteous (and often annoying) rhetoric about evils of capitalism as Lonely Planet. I find this aspect commendable: some of us want the travel guide to give us facts and not explanations for whom to vote and what to think.However, on balance, I have to admit that Lonely Planet is better resarched and more accurate, and also less bulky. If you have plenty of luggage allowance and money's no object, buy both, otherwise, stick with Lonely Planet."
3,Interesting but not so relevant,"Yes, this is an interesting guide. If you are either an adventurer and/or an armchair traveller, by all means try it out ! Yet, this is not the kind of book it clams to be, namely a travel guide. Few people would find it relevant to their travel plans while in Africa. If you want advice from Lonely Planet, who published this book, then get their other book ""Lonely Planet West Africa"", much more thorough and relevant for most travellers."
5,Best short exercise video of all time,I have an exercise video collection and love this one for days when time is at a premium! Mine was lost on a loan out and I want more....anyone got one for sale?
4,"Easy to follow, non-stressful, perfect for a beginner","This is great for me, a beginner who does not have a lot of time, but wants to improve her life. This was recommended to me due to its simplicity, ease of doing, and shortness, 15 minute segments each day. I loved it."
5,Please rerelease this awesome workout video!,This is such a great video for busy people who need help to maintain a regular exercise routine. Raquel motivates you and gets you going on those days it is difficult to motivate yourself. I'm in that situation right now and my sister's tape of A Week With Raquel is currently unavaible to me. It will be a very happy day for me when this is re-released.
5,Awesome!,Of all the yoga videos I've seen this is the only one that makes sense - - a workout that's short enough that even those pressed for time can't complain. But those 15 minutes each day make a huge difference. Plese re-release this one - - it's the best!
5,THE BEST 15 MINUTES OF EXERCISE FOR ANYONE,"This a week with Raquel video is easy to follow along to, you need no expensive equipment. The best part is in just a few weeks you can see the results of just 15minutes a day. I have owned this video in England, Canada and in the USA. I am in need to purchase another copy as I fear I have worn mine out....."
4,Brings out the color,Worked great on the rainforest granite countertop and shower but left a funny smell in the shower. Overall a good product
3,Ordinar y book written by famous authority,"I bought the book because I intend to build a japanese style house.This book is useless in residence design.The title is wrong!The book is about famous royal palaces and sorroundings.It contains exactly nineteen beautiful color pictures, showing some general views of six imperial palaces and gardens. Short descriptions and historical details are presented with a score of black and white pictures and some sketcks.It is difficult to believe that this ordinary book was written by the former leading authority in premodern Japanese architecture.I recommend ""Form & Space in Japanese Architecture"" by Norman Carver Jr, who really understood and captured the the japanese spirit."
3,Dated but nice,"I read the first edition of this book, wich dates from 1995. So the information is old, though relevant.If Japanese gardens are new to you and you want a quick insight into this matter (on less than 30 pages of text), exemplified on some 5 of the most important gardens in Japan to learn about the history and its most important aspect: the integration of the garden with the surrounding architecture, this is a good book.One of the advantages of reading older books, like this one, is that is shows you fotos which are old too. This book contains fotos from gardens in times long go by, in which you can see many differences with the actual situation. So also it gives you some clues on the development of these gardens. For example the foto of Ryoanji shows the garden with the surrounding earthen wall topped with a tiled roof. This roof over the wall is now made of bark, which to my opinion looks nicer because of its more informal character.Though old, I liked this book."
1,I HATE THIS VACUUM CLEANER,"This vacuum cleaner sucks, and NOT the way you want it to. If I could give it a negative star rating I would!! It has not worked properly ever since we got it. It has been in for repairs three times and it still does not vacuum more than one room in our house without shutting itself off. I will NEVER purchase another Bissel product again in my life, ever."
1,Horrible vacuum,"This vacuum does not suck anything up! It worked for maybe a month or two, and that was it. Now, though there are no clogs and a clean filter, this wont even pick up visible dirt that I can move with my foot! Total waste of money!"
1,Awful....,"This is the most horrible vac I have ever owned. I used this less than 10 times with 1 dog and 1 cat and it lost its suction, the filters had to be cleaned constantly, and the dirt conatiner is sooooo small. It is also terribly dusty when you try to clean out any of the other filters. While cleaning today it basically backfired and left my in a cloud of dust.....Fortunately I was able to take it back to the store. Don't buy this- its awful!!!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"I bought this vacuum a year ago and it has been to the shop about 4 times now. We have almost paid as much in repair as we paid in price! We have also had to fix it ourselves on many occasions. It is not able to handle our animals fur and the canister is very small. It clogs constantly and even the guy we brought it to for repair said it was not worth buying. I am now looking for a Dyson to see if that works. All this been said, I do have 4 animals and I vacuum every day, but I still think that this is not a good product. I have always used Hoover in the past and I found them much better, I just thought I'd try this one out, but sadly to no avail."
1,I second everything in the 1-star reviews,What a piece of junk. I wish I could go back in time and not buy this vacuum... I'd do it in a second.
1,Worse vaccuum I ever had,"There are so many things I don't like about this vacuum I don't know where to begin. Its heavy. It's attachments are small and cheaply made. I ordered a separate floor attachment for my bare floors but I still have to stoop over to use it and the tube collapses whenever I put any pressure on it. And because the hose is too short, I end up pulling the whole vacuum over in the floor. It is dirty and dust accumulates all over the outside of it. I usually end up vacuuming the outside of the vacuum. When you change the filters, do it outside. As far as the canister lifting off, I wish they had just put wheels on it and I could just use it as a real canister vacuum. I guess I will end up buying another vacuum because this one is virtually useless to me but I won't get a Bissell again. My other vacuums have lasted at least 10 years. My one star is for the motor. It does have incredible suction. Its so good that it ate the binding off my rug!"
2,Underwhelmed...,"I read tons of reviews for this vacuum before I purchased it, and everyone loved it... except me! I don't have any pets, but thought it would be great for any carpet since it picks up pet hair, but I was very under whelmed. Pros - it's easy to put together. Cons - didn't work as well as I expected. It had mediocre suction. I ended up returning it and purchasing the Bissell Velocity. LOVE IT MUCH BETTER. Cool purple color, picked up so much debris and fuzzies off my carpet, I had to empty the canister 4 times (and I'm not that dirty!). So my assessment is no-go on the Pet Vac. I love the lift-off feature, makes it great to carry around and light!"
2,"Durable, no, cool features yes, but wortless in the end","We bought this in November of 2005 and with in 90 days the front roller had to be replaced. It does clean well when it works, but we use it about once a month, so that means we are on the 15th or so use of it and it just gave up the ghost totally. I would say stay away from this thing unless you can buy it for $30 or less."
2,the basic problem....,"Is that Ehrlich simply does not understand basic economics. I only have un undergraduate physics degree, but an advanced economics degree, and it stuns me how many mistakes the author makes. The result, unfortunately, is highly distorted view of environmental problems. This is sad because we need both sound science and economics (policy) to guide us -- not this hype."
2,Much too easy,"I saw this game, rented it from the store, and brought it home. It took me an hour to beat the game 100%, and the graphics were awful. They were pointed all over, and looked worse than Lara Croft from Tomb Raider I. I would not reccomend buying this game enless you're a first time gamer or under 8 years old. Rent, don't buy if you're older."
4,its good,"It's exciting,but not that good.It changes nothing in the game,but where the puzzle pieces are...I think"
1,This game [stinks]!!!,"This game is a waste of your money! This game is dumb and it shouldn't of been sold! This game is way easy and is a waste of your time. I wouldn't buy this for $[money]. You are better off buying a better CD for the same price!By:3 gamers 12, 9, and 6"
3,You kidding?,Well my 5 year-old Bro liked it. Thats not saying much for this game. Well the game is nice i played it once and beat it in 1 hour and didn't have much chanage in the game. So if your lokking for a harder kind of game this is not that game.
4,Awesome Game,"This game is awesome. I remember getting this game and being extremely excited because it was Rugrats. This really IS a great Rugrats game; the best that has came out. In this game, you can play golf, and even walk around Tommy's entire house and backyard. This is a great game that is a lot like the show. Rugrats in Paris The Movie for teh N64 has got nothing on this game. Buy this for anyone that is a fan of the show.8.3/10"
4,"Fun, affordable, but too easy","I don't really have this game but I played it over my freinds house and needed to buy it. It is a kids game, but I had fun playing it, and I'm not a Rugrats fanatic. However, the game is fun and enjoyable, but it is a VERY simple game if you are 10 or older. If you can't stand playing kids games even if they are fun, you shouln't get this game, but if the only thing you care about is how fun the game is, buy this game."
1,i want my money back,"The reason why i gave this a bad rating is because the disc was already badly scratched and it would not start at all, either i get another copy or give me back my money"
3,CAUTION: THIS DVD DOESN't PLAY IN ALL DVD PLAYERS.,"The series is actually very good, but this particular DVD doesn't play in all DVD players. It doesn't play in my DVD player, but did play in one other one in my house. It worked in one out of three DVD players. I asked for a replacement, which Amazon provided, but I had the same problem."
4,Unfabulous,I remember this show. i still have the soundtrack of this show too. but why do they have to be so much.
5,Full-Sized Ear (25 Pieces Means 25 Fullsized Ears),"I hesitated buying these because I couldn't find any info on the size of the ears. Took a gamble & was happy to find each ""piece"" is actually a full-sized pig's ear & you get 25 in the package.I have two Yorkie Poos who love, love, LOVE pigs ears. My dogs are not small @ about 18 pounds each (I know--GIANT Poodle + Yorkie), but these are pretty calorie-rich treats, so I use a pair of sheet metal shears (kind of like these:Wiss M300 MultiMaster 3-Inch Cut Capacity 10-1/2-Inch Straight, Left, and Right Cut Long Handled Snip) to cut each ear into 4 pieces (makes us 2 days' worth of treats).Pigs ears do a SUPERB job of keeping teeth clean & these are equal to the quality I was buying locally. Prices do seem to fluctuate widely, depending, I suppose, on pork prices."
1,Not a Scream,"SCREAM QUEENS NAKED CHRISTMAS is actually 57 minutes long not 85 minutes. The rest of the 28 minutes is theater trailers. The movie features the talents of Debbie Rochon, Susan Ellen White, Christine Cavilier, and Lisa Ann Duval. The blonde you see on the video cover is not in the movie and some of the pictures on the back of the video box were not in the movie. I can tell you right now the nudity is in the D+ area and that is being nice. If you are going to be naked then be naked. The actresses if you want to call them that start off with skimpy clothing then strip down. The stripping takes forever and you have less than a minute of nudity. Also there is no plot to this movie. I guess the whole movie was written on a napkin. The sound is horrible and the narrator made it only worse. With him out of the picture, good ten or fifteen minutes of the movie could have been deleted. This video was neither a scream nor truly naked."
3,more details needed,"I brought the original version of this book back in the 70s. As a teen I studied every picture as there were mainly drawings to show moves. The text supported the drawing but more details were needed. It covered the basics of several martial art disciplines to include: karate, judo, juijitsu, kung fu, savate, and maybe another. The suggested exercises were interesting. Compared to the Bruce Tegner books which were real popular at that time, this book was easier to read and less cumbersome, more straight-forward."
5,I love this game!,"I absolutely loved this game. It was the first time I ever played Civilization, and now it's got me hooked. I can't wait to see other versions of the game, hope they're as much fun as this one!"
3,OK game,"Civ 2 Gold was alright. It's basicly playing civ2 with more scenarios. The problem with the scenarios is that they're kind of boring. You also get to play multyplayer online, or with your friends on the same computer. There are some changes in gameplay but not alot. It's not worth anymore than $20. You might like it if you already have civ 2 and want something new"
4,"Good, but not as good as Call to Power","I was a little disappointed with this game after playing both it ans Civilization: Call to Power. CTP had a crisper feel to it and went further into the future. Still, I enjoyed it overall."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"There are simple and obvious reasons for questioning traditional dates and times assigned to the life of Jesus. Hoehner, however, is a conservative scholar who rejects most of these complaints. His approach is academic and absolutely exhaustive and his style is as dry as sawdust. He left me feeling as though I had the attention span of a ten year old and less than a casual interest in the subject matter. While this is very common in academic writing, I have to wonder if it is necessary. I was once asked to ""edit,"" and possibly rewrite, an article by a local pastor for a nation-wide religious periodical. He had been told it lacked ""readability."" Aside from their credentials, I don't know how the academics get published in the mainstream."
3,Not the greatest dectector out there.,"For the top of the line Cobra Model, I was definitely disappointed with the 9700. It's Compass comes in handy and the intellimute works well to kill off unwanted beeps and voice alerts from garage openers and car keys. However, as a radar detector, it is only mediocre at best. Unlike other reviews, my experience with this device has been somewhat positive. It DOES pick up signals but perhaps too late. POP (instant on radar) alerts are picked up only when your car gets hit by one, and by that time your speed has already been clocked so what's the point? Normal, always on radar such as K and X bands get picked up AT MOST 1/2 mile away. Most of the time though it ends up being 1/4 mile maybe less. It has saved me a couple times but I wouldn't buy this device again if i had the chance."
3,Does it's job,"The more you spend on a radar detector the longer the range. To me that is common knowledge. If you want a radar detector to pick up sooner you need to spend more money on one. When I bought this one I knew the range would be shorter than a detector I spent $500 for, but I am only a woman. So guys should definitely know what they are buying. This radar detector does what it is supposed to do. It is not a $300 radar detector. If you want it to pick up a radar 2 miles down the road spend twice the money on a radar detector. Overall it: it does what you money pays for it to do."
2,I Got a Ticket and the Thing Broke,"Most reviewers have covered the shortcomings of this radar detector. To cut to the chase, I was fairly certain the 9700 had ineffective range when I'd drive by cops and the detector would not go off. There were also countless other times that I saw the cops and then I'd slow down and AFTER I slowed down b/c I saw the cops, then the detector would go off. It finally caught up to me and I was ticketed b/c the Pop didn't go off until the cop was already waving me off to the side of the road. To top it off, the on/off button malfunctioned all of the time until it finally won't even come on anymore. I bought this unit b/c I thought I was getting good value and and it was supposed to be Cobra's top of the line unit. I am about go for quality over value and go with the Escort 8500."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I got this at walmart (called the Cobra 777) and returned after 2 weeks. I drove by numerous cops, and theres now way not one of them had there radar on, i saw a few watching people go by and still nothing would happen. i had 1 pop hit but i was directly behind the cop on the road. the only times i ever get hits is driving on busy two lane shopping area, or in the middle of nowhere where this nothing around.. i brought it back and found a Passport X50 for $200 new on this site and got it(there were 2 left at this price idk if you will find one..)"
4,IT'S OK,IT'S BEEN OK SO FAR THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF TIME THAT I THINK THAT COPS HAVE RADARS THAT THIS DETECTOR CAN'T PICK UP BUT THATS JUST ME....
4,KNOW YOUR RADAR,"THIS RADAR IS A VERY CAPABLE UNIT. AS WITH ALL RADARS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR PRODUCT. FIRST, THE UNIT HAS A SERIES OF DIFFERENT BEEPS FOR ALL RADAR DETECTION. THIS COMES WITH A SERIES OF LIGHTS. LEARN TO RECOGINZE THE RADAR UNIT. AS YOU DRIVE ALONG THE ROAD, MAKE IT A POINT TO PAY ATTENTION.A RADAR UNIT IS NOT A LICENCE TO BREAK THE LAW BY SPEEDING!!"
4,Mike Stern - Paris Concert,"Mike Stern is indeed a gifted guitarist. He plays a mean axe, but has the tendency to ""overimprovise"" - gets somewhat pointless at times. Otherwise a good product overall. I was disappointed by Dennis Chambers' rather too laid- back approach to the session. Not at his ruthless and melodic/rythmic best on this one"
4,Replacement chairs for Ethan Allen dining set,"I bought an Ethan Allen dining set in 1993. Now the spindles on the chairs are slowly breaking both in the back and underneath the chairs. I bought these chairs to replace some of the broken Ethan Allen chairs. These chairs are large and very sturdy. You will sit higher off the floor than you do with the Ethan Allen chairs. The seats are not too comfortable since they only have a slight and small depression where the Ethan Allen chairs have a much broader and deeper indentation for your rear end. But with cushions, they should be fine! I paid $89 for 2 of these chair with free shipping and I think that is a true bargain since I also searched for these chairs on the Internet and they were listed for much more elsewhere. Even at $[...] for two chairs is a great deal. We'll see how they wear compared to the Ethan Allen track record. Highly recommend."
2,Content great but format flawed,1.I didn't like the format. I don't want a book that looks like a third grade workbook. Please treat me like an adult professional.2.Much to much time is wasted on why cooperative learning is the best way to teach. If I wasn't interested in cooperative learning I wouldn't have ordered the book. As a result one has to wade through tons of irrelevant material to get to the content that I am interested in.3.Any teacher presenting his material in such a disjointed method would bore and confuse his class. The presentation is really bad and time wasting for someone who wants Dr. Kagan's wisdom on cooperative learning of which there is a lot in this book.
5,"Johnny Lingo...beautiful scenery, story and music!","My husband and I viewed this movie in the theatre and tremendously enjoyed the beautiful photography of the ocean and islands. The music added so much to the movie, too! We also enjoyed the storyline. We thought it was touching and taught a good and uplifting message. We have been anxiously waiting for this DVD to be released."
3,8 Cow Wife???,Saw the original of this and believe this is the better of the two with a more in depth look into the story. My thanks for all concerned in the project. Great family viewing.
4,"Johnny Lingo..beautiful photography, music and story!","My husband and I saw this movie in the theatre and really loved it. In fact, I was hoping to get the DVD for Christmas, but alas, it was not available yet.I so much enjoyed the beautiful island and ocean scenes and the music. Also, the story was heartwarming and very enjoyable.I very much liked this movie and have recommended it to our friends."
1,IF THERE WAS A TURKEY RATING I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN IT,My title says it all about this movie. Sappy. Pathetic. Poorly shot. Poorly acted. Poorly directed. Apparently underfunded. A commercial masquerading as a movie. A Turkey! Choose Whale Rider instead.
1,Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,Terrifically awful. Gut-wrentching to the soul. Headbanging in Hell. Does this show any resemblance to the Jesus Christ that we serve and learn about in the Bible? I think not........get a life and be still in the presence of the Lord! Please.
3,pretty cool,well the album has a unique style nastalgic of strongarm. But whats up with the naked chick on the top of the cd. They are a CHRISTIAN band?
1,more like a history book...,"i'll admit that i made a mistake in buying this one. the cover was simply beautiful, you see (that was the reason i had to give it one star). this is one of the attestations that you should never judge a book by its cover.so, okay, he claims you for his own, you two have sex....then you fall in love? excuse me, but i dont see the ""connection"" on that. everything just virtually centered on the war. and it went on and on for pages. it simply dragged. you wouldnt find romance what with all the betrayal and killings. and the end...it was terrible. i could have tolerated the story if not for the end.simply put, you wouldnt remember the story between the ""lovers"" since your head was muddled with talk of war and vengeance. so unromantic."
4,Better Than Expected,"I bought this only because I couldn't find anything better at the grocery store. I ususally like the ""heavier"" historical romances that feature real historical people. But I was pleasantly surprised!This has just enough historical references to make it interesting and was a very entertaining romantic read.I have been trying to find the other books in the series ever since, but can't find them anywhere. I'd appreciate any source leads."
1,I Couldn't Stand it !!!,"I normally like Shannon Drake. But....what on earth was she thinking? If you enjoy to read about rape -- not once, not twice, but, throughout the ENTIRE book. Then this book is for you. I found myself skipping pages due to the VERY overbearing historical facts!!"
4,A pretty good read,I thought this book was okay except for a few irritating things. Such as the long drawn out war seen and how is it that the woman on the cover hair is black but Kyra hair is reddish blond at least be consistant. I thought there arguments and hatred for each other and Kyra escaping grew kind of tiring. But overall I thought the book was pretty good.
4,Good Product,"It was not exactly the product I needed and I did have to modify it somewhat, but it worked fine. If you have the right base I am sure it would be easier to work with."
4,"Great sound quality, nice DVD features","The songs easily get five out of five. But if you're reading this, chances are you already know all of the songs. The mix and the novelty of the DVD format gets four stars.Sometimes it's a bit distracting hearing these songs in a way that differs from how I've heard them for the last 28 years. The mix is obviously different, and separating the channels so much makes for a different overall sound. But I enjoy it. The sound is clear, rich, and powerful. I wish that more DVD audio titles were available."
3,A little too eclectic for my tastes...,"As a huge BNL fan, I sought out the Brothers Creeggan hoping to get a little more of that Barenaked fix. I've always enjoyed the Creeggan's performances, especially the ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" live rendition at BNL concerts.Unfortunately, I found this CD to be a little too eclectic for my tastes. Perhaps I'm a little pedestrian in my musical likes and dislikes but this CD just never gelled for me. I listened to each track wondering if it was going to get better than the previous one and was disappointed each time. Chucked the CD into the eBay ""To Sell"" bin."
3,New sound for Alanis decreases quality,"Two most eagerly awaited sophomore albums of 1998-Garbage's ""Version 2.0"" and Alanis Morissette's ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"". To me Version 2.0 proved to be outstanding and better than the original. However Alanis kind of sunk a little. Her new sound just doesn't match up to ""Jagged Little Pill"". How dissapointing it was to me to hear ""Thank U"" on the radio for the first single. Weak music and repeated lyrics on the song didn't appeal to me. Being the big Alanis fan I was I went on and bought the album and fought some cool and some effortless songs. ""Joining You"" and ""Baba"" show Alanis is still the Alanis she was in 1995. However ""Front Row"" and ""Heart of the House"" show a side of Alanis I'd thought I'd never want to see. So decide for yourself if Alanis' follow up is for you."
3,Jim Rook vs. Mr. Freeze,"In this one, Jim Rook, the special ed. teacher who can see dead people (Masterton has compared him to a supernatural Gabe Kotter), is up against a spirit who, because it is blind, is invisible even to Rook, who is apparently stalking one of Rook's students, and who freezes things. Oh, and a cat is defrosted after showing up in one of the spirit's ice blocks. The cat has some significance to the back story, but it's never adequately explained.Average Masterton. Not one of his great ones, not one of his terrible ones. I never felt fully absorbed in the story."
2,Left me cold,"My first read of a Masterson book, and I am not sure I will pursue his others. The premise is an interesting one, but I found most of the characters unsympathetic -- including the main one, Jim Rook. The writing wasn't a complete turn-off, but did get annoying in spots. As for the hands-on-the-frozen-rail episode, Mr. Masterson obviously doesn't believe that less is more."
2,Get an editor,"I've only read one other book by Masterton and was very impressed with it. Walkers was a very intertaining story, so when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try. The story itself isn't too bad, kind of predictable, but O.K. However about halfway through the story the whole suspense factor is shot. Everything is given away and the rest of the book is just clean up. One thing that really bothered me was the total lack of proofreading in the story. There were so many typos and obvious errors it made the story hard to read at times. There is absolutely no punctuation in the story. Ever Mr. is Mr and every contraction is without it's apostrophe."
4,"Good, but was hoping for more live footage","Overall this DVD was very enjoyable. Since it's the only Rhapsody DVD available I can't complain too much but what really irks me is that I was hoping it would contain a complete concert. As a fan in the USA who has not had the chance to see Rhapsody live I was looking forward to the complete concert experience. The behind the scenes footage is interesting but I would've preferred it to have been treated as bonus footage accompanying a concert performance.It's obvious this DVD was influenced a lot by label mate, Joey DeMaio of Manowar fame. The format is very similar to the Manowar DVD's. That's not necessarily a bad thing if there were other DVD's to choose from but alas I believe I'll have to keep waiting to see the real thing. I may have to schedule a European vacation soon if I can't satisfy my live Rhapsody cravings here in the States."
3,Wasn't impressed - You may like it more than me though,"I bought this CD compilation because it's one of few albums where you can find ""Shiny Disco Balls"" by ""Who Da Funk"" on it.The 2 disc combo is a good collection of songs, however, for me, Disc 1 only had 1 good song which was ""Only Time"" (song #6), and Disc 2 had about 6 songs which were good. The rest aren't anything great.I had an Amazon.com gift certificate, otherwise if it wasn't for that and this album having ""Shiny Disco Balls"" on it, I would have had to pass on the purchase. You can find it used on some Amazon.com merchant's sites or eBay for less."
2,"This is not the New Jersey Based Band, but British Techno","This was a listing for a band called ""Smithereens"" and the album 1234. This is not the new jersey based band ""The Smithereens"" whose first full album was Especially For You. ""Smithereens"" is a british 80's pop synth group, and a low average one at that. Nothing memorable on it.Here is the tracklisting for this albumTracks: 1.) You is a Guarantee 2.) For Love 3.) Promiscious 4.) Speed of Life 5.) Time Ticks Tragedy 6.) Just Enuf 7.) He's a SuckerHope you find this helpful"
5,Vangelis' best album...,"Quite simply, Vangelis' masterpiece. Opening to the sounds of a thunderstorm, often imitated and never bettered, this is, perhaps, the ultimate ambient album before even Eno got the idea. Painting a true soundscape, this can be enjoyed on any level - from background ""fluff"" to a deep, intense and rewarding experience. This album has it all."
4,Close to nature,"This is not one of his best, like Voices or Blade Runner, but it is still a good CD. It is relaxing music, in harmony with the nature, sort of."
4,Not for newbbies,"This Vangelis album is not for newbbies. That why I'm awarding it just 4 stars.It's great, pefect, a gem, but definitely not for newbbies.If you are not a Vangelis specialist (I mean if you just like one or two songs by Vangelis) you rather buy Voices, or Spiral, or Direct, or Reprise, or... but never Soil Festivities.In my honest opinion you should know Vangelis, at least a little, before daving into this album.On the other hand, if you feel you are ready for Vangelis not-so-well-known stuff, then don't hessitate, this album's amazing from the very cover to the most inner parts. ;-)"
2,Tired twinkles,"Rather dull exercise in early staged symphonic electronica either wallows in uninspired repetition or bombastically relays scattershot ideas, all under a five movement pretense."
4,The Master at work...,"This and 'Antartica' are my favourite cd's by Vangelis. Movement 1 is a brilliant example of the true talent of this man, it still gets my full listening attention each time I hear it. I wish his catalog of great works would be remastered and that someone would realize that his superb soundtrack for the film 'The Bounty' deserves to be available on cd. The dvd does have his sountrack on it but I want it on cd. I have always wondered about the cover, a soundtrack for an insect documentary? What a dvd that would be. Another great one from Vangelis."
3,the kid - warner home video release,"the kid is a 5 star movie, but the version in this disc is a cut down 1971 re-release. it does contain the deleted scenes in the special features disc. my beef is that we do not get the original release from 1921, but the scaled down version from 1971. i thought the scenes they cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. i believe the image ent. version runs complete and is nicely restored but is going at a much higher price"
5,Great product the quality and clarity is great!,It is the best picture and sound of this movie I have seen. And it comes with special features which is just the icing on the cake!
1,Where is the sound??? Where is the music?,"I purchased the Enhanced Edition and there is no sound at all. No music. Where is the music? Come on here. I have viewed the movie many time before and from what I know Charlie Chaplin wrote the music. How can you sell this movie without the sound?? So why didn't it detail the fact that there is no sound? All ""silent"" movies had a piano backing and this one is omitted both from the dvd and the description. I call that a rip off..."
5,Simple Decision,"To me the Allman Brothers creative peak was four LPs: Idlewild South, Fillmore East, Eat A Peach, Brothers and Sisters.If you are an ABB fan you own this CD already (I did). You can also get this show in trading circles (along with some other fine audience and soundboard recordings) if you want to go to the effort (and ultimately more cost than this).Released after Duane's death, this was originally a double LP. Great one as well - my personal favorite of the four listed above (it just beats out Fillmore East). Their first top 10 CD and the CD that propelled them into playing Stadiums like RFK or venues like Watkins Glen.The sound is superb, the songs are excellent. What truly makes this worthwhile is the second disc of live music and the SOUND of that music. The Whipping Post and You Don't Love Me alone are to die for.Even though I had the Remastered CD (and the SACD as well) I popped for this and don't regret it one bit. I doubt you will either."
5,Jaw Dropping,"Forget about the fact that you have probably listened to this classic work a thousand times...you need this!The 2nd disc is an absolute must-have- in fact, the version of ""You Don't Love Me"" that graces this new deluxe edition is worth the price of admission ALONE. Duanne and Dickey create a sound that is nothing short of majestic- it literally gave me chills. Add that the sound quality of the live set is fantastic, if you have any appreciation for the this great American band you should own this. Essential listening."
3,"Not the cream, but still ""essential"" for any blues fan.","If the the dual guitar ""call and response"" of the intrumental break in ""One Way Out"" doesn't raise goose flesh...you are not from the south. And, you're quite possibly dead. That cut alone makes the album worth its price."
4,Eat A Peach,"I downloaded this as a MP3 album from Amazon when it was on the $5 album special. I really prefer the tangible quality of a CD because I'm a collector, but if it's $5 vs $10 or more I can do with the download. I'm old enough to remember seeing the Allman Brothers Band while all the original players were still living. Eat A Peach was so named from Duane's response to an interviewer's question: ""How are you helping the revolution?"" Allman replied: ""There ain't no revolution, only evolution, but every time I'm in Georgia I 'eat a peach' for peace."" I hadn't listened to the album for a number of years (I owned it on vinyl only) and I am was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it still sounds all these years later. This album, and it's predecessors, are the Allman Brothers at their peak. All the tracks are good. If you like Southern rock, this album should be in your collection and on your play list."
4,eat a peach alblum,"received item separate from an order which contained 3 no problem realizing it came from britain and would take a little longer than usual. cd worked fine, wasn't wrapped in packaging, but cd worked fine so no complaints."
5,eat a peach,great CD .The allmanBrothers band did rhis back in the 1970 s.Sounds just as good today as it did then.so much deep and talent
5,Classic album,Great entire album. Still stands up today. Only thing better would be the vinyl . Blah blah blah blah blah
5,One of the Best Southern Rock Albums Ever,"Along with Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Street Survivors,"" The Allman Brothers' ""Eat a Peach"" is one of the defining albums of Southern Rock. It is also the high point of this troubled band's recording career. That said, its also an interesting mix of songs, with the live track ""Mountain Jam"" checking in at over a half an hour, or nearly as long as the rest of the album combined. Yet it is a great half hour, an amazing feat in that it is not at all repetetive or boring. The rest of the songs are almost all Allman classics, including ""Blue Sky,"" ""Ain't Wasting Time No More,"" the ballad ""Melissa"" and the amazing Duane Allman guitar solo ""Little Martha"" that is made even more poigniant by the fact that he died not long after recording it.""Eat a Peach"" is a must own for any fan of southern rock. It is simply the Allmans' finest hour."
2,Too jammy,"I do love the allman bros but the album itself was too full of just jammin for me! That's my fault though, I should've looked at the times of all the songs before purchasing"
2,nothing special,"I recently discovered my DVD player was capable of playing the SACD format. I first purchased Steely Dan on SACD and was astounded. Unfortunately, Eat A Peach left me feeling like I bought just the pit. Assuming you are buying this for the SACD sound, skip it."
2,excellent musicians boring music,i was really bored while trying to listen to this album. Technically speaking Allman Brothers are really clean band and the sound quality was on point but thats all the positive stuff i have to say... 30 minute jam session??? after 5 minutes i was ready to shoot my ipod.
4,Classic Rock at its Best!,Awesome jam. The music has to move you even If you are dead! I hear new music every time I listen. Ive been listening to this band for over 25 years.
4,It is a Good Name,"It is a really good game, the graphics are great. I love it when you see your army of 15 horses marching in and attacking everything. Its really fun, althugh for Mac you can only play against Macs and it is also pretty annoying the Population Limit it has. You also can not build a whole army at once you have to build it soldier by soldier."
1,Age of Empires pre OS X Not compatible,"I loved the Age of Empires on PC. However, I never got a chance to play Age of Empires for Mac. I didn't realize that it was a pre OS X product, therefore, I was not able to open the download. The information I received from amazon was misleading. I bought the product not knowing it was not going to work on my I MAC. I learned a very valuable lesson. I reccommend that anyone wanting to buy boxed software online should double check what they are getting. The price was also excessive and should have given me the clue not to buy it. Amazon.cpm does not take back opened software. Unfortunately, I had to open up the software and run it to find out it was not what I wanted."
3,a knockoff of the more interesting Civilization,"I can't really see what the appeal of this game would be when you could just buy Civilization II. Yet again Microsoft steals someone else's idea and doesn't carry it off very well. The mac version is a pretty horrible port, and doesn't follow Mac user interface conventions at all. The mouse cursor gets stuck now and then, too. Laying out the empire isn't nearly as interesting as in Civ. The warfare aspects are OK, although the defender gets such a big advantage that wars tend to be inconclusive unless one side just wasn't prepared. I guess some people might like the real-time format better than the turn-based format of Civ, but personally I just find that half the time I'm bored because nothing's going on and the other half of the time too much is going on at once and I get messed up."
1,Problems with iMac,"I purchased this a week ago since I heard great things about this game and having played Civilization a Call to Power. After installing it, it kept prompting me for the cd even when running the program off the cd itself. I wrote to tech support within the hour and have yet to hear back. I can however play the scenarios and found Civilization to be more challenging with better game controls. I often lost member of my civilization and had to scroll the entire map to distinguish to dark blue dots from the black dots. Overall, I am not impressed and will stick with Civilization games in the future."
1,Out of the box. . .and back in again,"Boring, tedious, and pointless. A mere shadow of the far superior Civilization (pick any incarnation). Why would anyone want to sit and watch people chop wood and carry carcass meat around the screen? Why does this game freeze my computer? Why do foreign civilizations appear from nowhere (always with better weaponry) and bombard me for no reason-with no hope of diplomatic recourse? I realize that with diligence, this game may be playable, but I was already spoiled by years of playing-you know."
5,Take your origami to the next level,"This is a must-read for anyone who is ready for the beginner who is looking to bring his/her origami to the next level. The beginning of the book expands the beginner's knowledge of folding techniques. LaFosse also explains the different types of paper available and their uses. As other reviews mentioned, the beginning of the book is the most help. The models are secondary information."
2,A 10 year old cassette I have sounds better than this,"I am not reviewing the record (CD) by the Dead , I love that, This is a review of the MOFI Japanese version, basically, it is a very bland sounding CD, with not much punch to it,just bland. Get the Rhino remastered version , it is excellent. I thought this was going to be a SACD or somthing special."
5,Buy The Expanded Edition!!!,"Make sure to buy the Amazon Expanded edition. It's remastered and contains live tracks of the songs. For some reason the expanded edition isn't showing up on the sale list for the Grateful Dead artist spotlight but if you type a search for it in the MP3 store, you will find it and it is also on sale right now for $2.99. Hmm. Same price but with 7 outstanding live tracks?! No brainer! And yes, I was duped into buying the non expanded version only to stumble across the expanded edition later. Oh well. There are bigger battles to fight in life!"
1,Disappointed,"If you're planning to buy this item to drown out other noises in the house, don't waste your money. When you turn the volume up all the way, it's still very quiet. It will not work for my daughter's room so we sent it back."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased a DEX sound sleeper a few years ago for my son and we loved it. I now have a daughter, so I wanted another one. Come to find out they changed the design and it no longer runs on battery power, you have to plug it in, which isn't very helpful when you lose power for a number of days or when traveling. I am very disappointed and I think it was a bad decision to change that feature."
3,Sleep Please!,The only problem I have with this product is that it just isn't loud enough. I love the way you can combine sounds and the size of the machine fits perfect on my bedside table.
3,Not loud enough,"I read reviews discounting other reviews stating this product was not loud enough. I should have listened. This product will not drown out household noises. I have humidifiers louder than this machine. lol. If your child or yourself need a decent amount of noise at night, this is not your machine. Other than that, its a decent machine. Sending mine back asap and continuing the hunt for the illusive white noise machine that is loud enough."
4,Good machine; needs higher volume,"We've had this sound machine for 4 years and 2 children. I've been happy with it, especially the sound options, but the highest volume is pretty low. We live near a major airport and a train track, and the baby's room is pretty central in our home. For the next baby I'll be purchasing a regular sound machine (not a baby one)."
3,Nice sounds; does not block out external noise,"I bought this to use in my baby's room and I do like the relaxing choices of sounds. I always leave it on the ocean waves. However, it doesn't block out external noise/sounds as much as I hoped it would, so I still have to use another machine that sounds like a whirring fan (white noise) so she won't hear the TV, etc. It is great in the car, though. So small you can just pack in the diaper bag and turn it on in the car to help the baby sleep."
4,Could be better,"I got this EXACT same item at WalMart for $9.99. Frankly, that's all it's really worth. The sound quality is not great, if I had paid $19.99 for it I would have been pretty disappointed."
5,happy mom,"I really like the fact that the Sound Sleeper can be used either plugged into an outlet or with batteries. We normally use it plugged in, but recently the electricity was out and we were able to use the batteries to run the Sound Sleeper. The constant sound helps our baby sleep better by keeping out some of the distracting noises we make when she's asleep."
3,"Works, but could be better","We had a great hand-me-down noise machine from my mother to use with our now 12-month-old son. It was great, but old, and eventually quit working. This is the one we got to replace it, and it's okay. I agree with what some other reviews have said, that the loudest volume setting isn't really loud enough if you're hoping it will be a noise blocker. Also, it's annoying that every time you turn it on, you have to reset it to the sound and volume level you want--it automatically reverts to the ocean sound when you turn it off. Finally, the machine that was shipped to us almost looks used; the white exterior is just slightly discolored in places, like it's a tiny bit dirty. This honestly doesn't bother me (I set it behind some pictures on my son's dresser) but it might bother some people."
2,"No actual ""white noise""","I assumed a ""white noise"" type of machine would have a true white noise setting. Not the case. This one only has womb and nature sounds. Do they really think that ""seagull"" and ""buoy"" settings are good sleeping sounds for children?"
2,Not NEARLY loud enough for a nursery. Disappointed!,"I am actually really mad that I wasted money on this item. We have been running a CD player with rain sounds in our son's nursery for months now. We were getting worried that the CD player might just die, so we thought this white noise machine would do. I was worried about the volume when I ordered it, but other reviews made me think it would be loud enough. NOT TRUE. This thing won't block out ANY NOISE. The puny little speaker is just not big enough. We'll just buy another CD player I guess. The rain sound is also very disappointing and just sounds like crackling sounds. Extremely disappointed."
2,Not very loud at all returned it,the sounds are good on this but issue is not loud enough unless your right on top of the thing. we returned it didnt do what we neede it to do
3,Tinny but fine,"Its about what I expected for the money. The sound effects sound mechanical, but the key thing is that I can leave it on or have a timer. It works for helping my boys to sleep - that is all I needed it to do."
2,Go with the Homedics sound machine,"We have the Dex and the Homedics sound machines. The Homedics is in my daughters bedroom, we bought tbe Dex for our bedroom. I liked the variety of sounds that came on the Dex. However, the sound quality on the Dex is pretty terrible. The speaker makes this crackling sound when you use some of the sound combinations. On ours, the night crickets and rain especially sound awful. The brook and the wind sound fine, as does the ocean. But on the Homedics, all of the sounds are nice and clear. Both products are the same amount, I would go with the Homedics as it sounds a lot better."
2,Volume not loud enough.,"It's easy to use, but my main complaint with this item is that the volume is simply not loud enough for me. I have had many noise machines over the years, and have never encountered one with such weak top volume. If you can place it directly by your head on a bed-side stand, it might be acceptable. But it simply doesn't produce enough volume to fill a room or mask many noises. Disappointing.For something in this price range, but with much greater volume, I would recommend the HoMedics SS-2000 instead:HoMedics SS-2000 Sound Spa Relaxation Sound Machine with 6 Nature Sounds, SilverIt's smaller, louder, AND cheaper."
2,worked great in the beginning,"I completely agree with the other reviewer who had trouble because I had exactly the same problem. This item worked great for a few weeks, the baby loved it! Unfortunately it started shutting off after only moments of use and everytime I turned it back on I had to turn the volume back up. There is definitely a manufacturing problem since I'm not the only one to have this problem. The idea is great and if it worked the way it did in the beginning, I would highly recommend it."
1,Too weak to work,"This unit lacks sufficient volume to be effective. The idea is to mask other noise, but you'd have to rubberband this machine to your head to mask anything. We got the Conair instead, and it does the job."
1,Very disappointed,"The sound sleeper doesn't play soothing sounds. All the sounds almost sound alike. The sounds are awful, not much like the real thing - not clear sounds. To me it sounds like a bunch of static on most of them. Listen to it in the store before you buy it if you can. Definitely not worth $20!"
3,"Great product, sound to low",Great product. It has a good selection of sounds. I like the ideal of combining two sounds. Like ocean waves with birds. The sound is to low. It doesn't drowned out other sounds.
2,Not great,"This machine was a disappointment. I got it for my sons' room. They like the ocean sound and it seems to be adequate for them. I find that the volume is wimpy. Every time you turn it on, you have to pump a button to bring the volume up to the max which is only medium in my opinion. It only maintains the type of sound, not the volume. You also have to be carfeul turning it on to not push it all the way to the timed setting. This will turn it off after a period of time. The first setting on the on/off switch will leave it on until you turn it off, but my sons cannot turn it on carefully enough to avoid that second timed setting. It has not stopped working after well over a year, but I still don't like it very much. I need another one for another room and I will be looking for something else."
1,Didn't work for my newborn,I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well. This thing doesn't have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work. However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer. It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.
4,Good Buy,"This is truly a good buy. The price reflects the quality in terms of how loud it is...but we have had it for almost 8 months now (including packing it several times, and dropping down the stairs once) and it still works just like the first time we used it.As other reviews have stated, it is kind-of quiet. We actually put it in with our son in his crib until he was old enough to move around and grab at it (around 3 months). Then, we moved it to the floor directly beneath his bed.We have dogs...it certainly does NOT cover their barking, but it is soothing and does help cover many noises. Ocean and Womb work best."
3,This item is fair.,I'm a psychotherapist and bought the Dex Sound Sleeper to use to diffuse noise in my waiting room so that clients can't hear conversations taking place in my office. I've used other systems in the past with great success. The two biggest complaints would be that the volume can't be turned up very high and that the sounds aren't real crisp. The brook and the rain settings don't exactly sound like the real thing. There other systems that sound better. The nice thing this system has is that you can have two sounds play at the same time. If you aren't real picky the system is fine for the price.
3,not as good as I expected...,"THe volume level max is way way too low. I bought this to use for myselft an adult and the highest volume level is where we are using it. I love the ability to mix the sounds which is a plus for its price. In addition the ""super saver shipping"" was a joke this holiday. Amazon had to send a replacement shipping as the item was lost. It arrived a month later."
4,Works Good,"We bought this for our baby because she is such a light sleeper that we needed something to help block the noise. It works really well, the only thing I noticed at first was I needed the volume to go a bit louder. However, now (about 6 months after purchase) the volume is fine. Our little girl sleeps much better when this is on than when it is off."
2,sound sleeper,This product was great for the first six weeks I had it but now it doesn't work....so I think either I have a defective one or they need to work some bugs out.
1,Des baby sleeping aid,"Item worked for 30 seconds then stopped working. Looked like it had been used previously. Waste of money, very disappointed with this item"
2,malfunctioned in less than 2 months,"This item was great for about 60 days. Did everything I expected out of it. The baby liked it so I was happy. Then it would only turn on for about 5 seconds and shut off. The return on this was easy, got a new one in 2 days. We'll see how long this one lasts."
3,Not very good speakers,"I like that it has so many settings and that it has the option to stay on all night instead of just shutting off after 60 minutes, but the sound quality on the Summer Night setting is fuzzy, and the over-all maximum volume is petty quiet in my opinion. I gave it a 3 star rating because I've had worse sound-makers, but this one is definitely not the best I've had, and I wouldn't really recommend it."
1,"VERY quiet, broke within one month","I would normally not write a review but I want to offer other buyers the chance to buy a more expensive, louder & better white noise machine. I bought this after reading reviews that it was pretty quiet. I thought the cheapest would work since it's for my baby's room & I didn't think the volume would be much of an issue. But this machine is VERY quiet. You really need to be able to amp up the volume a lot more and it needs a better, fuller sound.After using it for a month, it broke. It won't stay on for more than one minute.I would urge you to spend the extra $20 and buy a better product. In the end, you'll be happier."
2,Not Loud Enough,"Sounds are good, but the volume does not get loud enough to drown out any background noise. I ended up getting a SleepMate because all I wanted was loud white noise."
3,Has Some Flaws,"People buy these types of products mainly to assist with sleeping. Recently my HomeMedics sound machine died and I went on Amazon to find another one. I found a plethura of these devices in all price ranges. I finally decided on this product as the price was right, and it had the sounds I wanted.Overall, it does what it is supposed to do. There are even 4 'mix' tones so that you can have 'Rain' playing, and add in bird sounds, thunder, etc. That's a nice touch.On the flip side, the unit's volume is too low. Even at the top setting you can still hear ambient noise around you. The other unit I had was so loud on the higher volumes that I never turned it all the way up. This one I put on Max all the time, and even then it's about half the volume of the HomeMedics unit I had.It's a decent machine, probably more suited to background noise in a less then hectic enviroment, or perhaps for a child. For those that need it to provide a sound zone to sleep in, it is flawed."
2,"not worth it, try the other brand","I received this for my baby shower and it's not worth it. If I would have been given the receipt, I would have returned it. The sounds could be better and the worse part is that it doesn't seem to get very loud even when the volume is turned all the way up. The other brand seems to have more features for the same price and I read no complaints about the volume."
3,"Not overly impressed with this unit, but it does work","We've had this unit for about 2 months for our son, and while this thing has worked with no issues, and it does have some good things going for it (price, plug in or batteries)the negatives outweigh the positives for me. First is the sound loops, they all seem to be about 3 seconds.. listening to it for any amount of time will drive you insane.. 3 seconds is not long enough in my opinion.The 2nd problem is the volume.. it just doesn't play loud enough to be really effective. When it's on at full blast it does not make a whole lot of noise."
3,worked 1 year,"Worked well for about a year, then got scratchy and I had to throw it away. Would have been a good product if it had lasted."
1,Piece of crap,I had it about a week when loud crackling noises started sputtering from the speaker. This was to help my newborn sleep. Waste of money.
2,Better products out there...,"We purchased this while expecting my first child, and as soon as it arrived I knew that we would not be satisfied with the product. Once you set it for what you want, you have to reset it every time you turn it back on. The volume lowers to almost inaudible, and it does not resort back to the last setting. My son sleeps with the rain sound, so EVERY time I turn it on I have to set it to rain and turn the volume all the way up to even come close to drowning out noises outside his room. This may not seem significant, but considering every time he goes down for a nap, or for the night, it adds up. We have the tranquil moments sound machine in our room from Brookstone and we will be spending the extra money and purchasing the baby version of this for our next child that we are currently expecting."
3,good value,"This sound machine does have some nice features that not all sound machines have. It's nice that there are many different sounds available. You can combine sounds, and you can make the sounds random (although then you can't pick and choose, so you have the brook sound with seagulls and bouys, which is maybe a little weird. But after all, the baby doesn't know the difference.) Don't count on using the womb sound, which sounds a lot like a side effect on a low-budget sci-fi series (I'd say it's pretty close to the sound the Tardis makes on Doctor Who.) I hope my womb didn't sound like that. The only other problem is, it does make a fairly loud click when it turns itself off which sometimes wakes my son up :( All in all I guess it suits it's purpose, and it's a decent value for the money. But once again, you get what you pay for."
3,Buy a CD instead,"Pros: Small, very portable, fairly long battery life, outlet available, several different sounds to choose from, and a fairly reasonable price.Cons: Sounds level is quite low on most sounds, however the ocean setting gets very loud. My daughter prefers the brook sound and it does not get very loud at all.I was happy enough with this until we started playing CDs of white noise for our daughter in the car and around the house. They work much better and now I wish we would have just gotten a small CD player to use in her room. I recommend the CD Waterfalls: Sounds of the Earth, it works like magic! I also got For Crying Out Loud and Transitions but they are very hit or miss. The waterfall works 95% of the time in the house or the car, she will calm down and be asleep in seconds, literally. Even when screaming at 100% capacity."
3,Dex prodict sound sleeperSS-01,"I've bought this product for myself, not for a baby. The soothing sounds may have been fine for a baby, but I did not find this product to have very good quality sounds. Some sounded better then others. Also, the sound volume could only go so low. I bought one by Conair, and I like it much better."
1,Horrible sound quality,Very poor sound quality. Very artificial sounds. Volume does not go very loud.
2,Changed my original review.,"Another update - 1/23/2013. We've now lost 3 tracks to horrible screeching and/or crackling sounds so I knocked another star off. Again.I originally posted 5 stars for this sound machine but I've changed my mind. We've been using it for just 4 months. It was great in the beginning but a couple of weeks ago the sound we were using started to make screeching noises in the middle of the night. We switched to another sound and it stopped but we can't use our favorite anymore. Hopefully, just the one digital track is damaged."
3,"Not bad,...but.....","All in all it's a good machine, but the ""loops"" on some of the recordings are too short...You can hear it click when it starts over..They should be longer before they repeat. The sea-gull is just plain annoying"
2,Lacks Ease of Use,This product requires that each time it is used that the desired sound and volume must be set. It does not remember your previous selections. There are better choices for those that want to use it nightly and do not want to have to set the volume and sound each night.
2,Too quiet,"This was way too quiet, even on it's loudest setting. My infant didn't benefit from it at all. The sounds are fine, and not too repetative as with some machines, but even in a small room (really small) I found it too quiet to be effective."
2,Poor quality machine,"When we couldn't find one that would work to demonstrate for us in the store we should have just left it there. Not one of the boxes on the shelf at our local store would play the demonstration although each box was marked for it. This worked well for us for all of 2 nights before it quit working. If I put it on ""continuous"" it would cut off after 30 minutes or so, and then start playing again on it's own. Sometimes I could not even get it to turn on and then miraculously it would come on the next 3 times I tried then go back to not turning on with the switch. Save your money on this one and go somewhere else to purchase a sound machine that will actually work."
4,Sound Sleeper is a buy.,"The sound sleeper is not going to calm a screaming, upset baby (I've tried), but if your baby is at that point then they should be picked up and held anyway.I have, however, found it useful on two fronts. First, I use the womb sound at night. Now my baby is conditioned to know that when that sound comes on it is time to go to sleep and that it is night-time. She almost seems relieved when she hears it because she's tired anyway and it gives her the sign that it is ok to node off.Second, I use the other sounds (birds chirping, etc.) during the day to peak her interest. These sounds don't seem to relax her so I use them to entertain her so I can get things done around the house.The reason I gave this product a 4 is because the volume should go up a little higher, but that con is offset by the fact that you can use either batteries or plug it into the wall, which is a big money saver. This product deserves a 4.5 rating in my opinion."
2,Horrible un-natural sounds.,"The idea is there... BUT the sounds just sound so fake! I tried to sleep to this last night and i wanted to throw it out the window. I don't expect my infant to like it. Horrible noises. The volume goes pretty loud for a quiet infants room, but when you turn it up the horrible fake noises sound even worse! This is going back tomorrow. I guess i will continue my search!"
1,Inaccurate description,"Evidently the description of this product needs updating. It will not work on batteries. The instructions with the machine state ""The demo mode and batteries are intended for display and shipping purposes only."" I've tried several times and have not been able to get it to work with batteries. Guess this is one reason the settings will not hold when you turn it off. Have to set your preferences and volume each time you turn it on. Probably would not have purchased if I had known this."
3,"Quality sounds but no true ""white noise""","I have the sound spa noise machine for my 2 other children. I decided to branch out and give this one a shot for baby #3. The sounds are quality and I found the volume to be fine in spite of other reviews. I had hoped that the wind noise would be more ""white noise"" like, but it isn't a constant wind noise, rather intermittent gusts of wind. I find that a constant white noise seems to block background noise better than noise that comes and goes (like many of the ocean sounds and this products wind sound). So there isn't really a true white noise setting on this machine. This would be fine for soothing, but if you need to block out the noise of other rambunctious siblings, I wouldn't recommend. I sent it back and will get a third sound spa for $17.00."
2,"Good price, good concept, poor sound quality","Great product except for one major flaw....it doesn't go loud enough to hear! We have another noise machine that my 3 year old uses, but we took this one on a trip to use in the hotel. She spent more time telling me she couldn't hear it and that it wasn't on than sleeping! Hotel room was pretty small and quiet so I cannot imagine trying to use this in a house with normal noises and having any success! I love being able to combine the sounds to customize the sound and the option to leave it on all the time or by a timer, but if she can't hear it it wont work."
2,Dex sound machine,Works great for a year. Our family is addicted to sound machines. There is one in every room. I have 2 homedics that have lasted for more than 5 years. Bought a Dex for the new baby who is now 16 months. The Dex just bit the dust. The homedics are still going strong even though they are dusty and old.
4,Good product,"This is a good product over-all. My child did not take to it so we ended up giving it to someone else, but it did what it was supposed to. I liked the waves and the white noise is good too. Anyone who lives in a dorm, loud apartment building, or need privacy screen in a office could use this. It is not just for babies. It is also a lot cheaper than a commercial privacy screen."
3,Sleep sound machine,"This is a good machine, but the sound level could be a lot louder. I bought this to drown out the noise we make when traviling and staying in a hotel room for which we all have to sleep in the same room. My 1 year old is a light sleeper and wakes at every little sound. This helped a little. We put it right by her play pin and had it as aloud as it could go, but she would still hear us. I have used one of the other more expensive machines from my sister with just the white noise. The level of that machine was much louder and my daughter never woke when we were all sleeping in the same room. I wuld say this is a good machine, but if you have a light sleeper as I do, go with the more expensive white noise machine."
1,Not loud enough,We owned a Brookstone noisemaker for several years. It broke and we looked to replace it. This noisemaker makes the same noises as our old noisemaker but it is very quiet. It is not effective in cancelling out distracting noises. I am going to try something else.
3,Sound machine,"I am a bit disappointed in the sound machine. The sounds do not sound natural and they seem to be on a very short ""loop."" It does provide white noise, just not as soothing and natural as I would have liked."
2,Sound Machine,I was disappointed with the product. First it doesn't have white noise and its not very loud at all. If you are buying to help block out other noise for your baby to sleep I would not recommend this. If its for an older child to have some smoothing sounds to sleep with than its fine.
5,really works,"Love it. I believe it really works, as our son is a much better sleeper when we use it. In fact, we sleep better just hearing it through the baby monitor. The first night we used it we slept through the noise & uproar of a fiery explosion 3 doors down + all the firetrucks & ambulances. Whether that was good or bad, that convinced me!"
3,Great for what it is,"My son is now 15 months old, and we have been using this sound machine since he was 3 weeks old. The womb sound was a huge help when he was a newborn, and helped him to sleep longer. Before we bought this, we had been using the womb sounds bear and were going through batteries like crazy. This is a much better investment.As he has gotten older, I continue to use it as white noise. That being said, it is not loud enough to block out all background noise. Some of the settings (brook, in particular) sound a little cheesy. But it is great to use when we are travelling, and the battery option is wonderful when you just want to throw it in a suitcase. The random and 2 noise options are great too. I think, for what you pay, it is an excellent option. Just remember that you get what you pay for."
1,broke in 1 month,"At first it worked fine, did a great job. Then after ~3 weeks, the sound started to go to static and cut in and out. One week later it was completely non-functional. We used a voltage meter to check if the motherboard was dead (maybe we could still run it from batteries?) and discovered that this device needed a 9 volt transformer. We got a 12 volt transformer in the box, which of course fried the electronics in short order.Not our mistake, but we are left with a useless piece of plastic. Great."
3,Decent but not great sound machine,"The DEX Sound Sleeper would probably be perfect for a baby or young child. Sound quality is a little iffy for an adult. I wanted some white noise to lull me to sleep. The ocean one does a good job, but the sound is a little tinny."
2,The Sound is Way Too Low,"We have had this for 2 weeks, and though we have not had problems with it, the VOLUME IS WAY TOO LOW. You can hardly hear it on the loudest setting. This is so very disappointing, as we need a machine like this to keep our baby asleep at night. The only sound that doesn't hiss on the loudest setting is the WIND, so that is what we have been using. I wish I had spent my money on a better product."
4,Not noisy enough,"I purchased this after reading ""The happiest baby on the block"" by Harvey Karp. Since he recommended white-noise machines, I hoped it would help my two month old daughter sleep longer. It has not really helped in that regard, I think for that it would have to be much louder (she sleeps wonderfully when the vacuum cleaner is on...) but it does block out noises so at least she does not wake up everytime someone makes a peep. I also noticed that it helps me to sleep better (she sleeps in our room)! So, overall, I do not regret purchasing this article. Might be more suitable for adults than for babies."
3,It works,"The volume on this machine leaves something to be desired. It does provide a variety of sounds, but you have to have the machine right next to the baby's bed to be able to hear it. We ended up purchasing another model which we like much better."
5,Sounds stays on all night!,"This was my one thing I wanted in a sound machine. I have bought the little lamb that has soothing sounds, but it only lasts 20 minutes or something like that. I didn't realize that when I bought it, we were wanting something that played the sound the whole time he slept to block out noises from outside and help him sleep.Great features:The sounds can be played sperately (rain, thunder, waves) or can be combined with other noises (rain and thunder).It can play for a short time or all night.Volume controls - can play very softly or loud enough to cover up noises of me cleaning while he sleeps.Has held up for going on one year so far with no problems! We play in every night and during every nap - he has slept 11 hours a night since he was 4 months old!"
1,very poor quality sound,"I guess I got what I paid for...not much. Scratchy, static... The only sound that didn't seem mechanical was the brook. Even that started making weird noises after 10 minutes. Spend more and be pleased with your purchase."
1,don't waste your money,"Oh my gosh, this is by far the worst sound machine I have ever seen. It comes with batteries and so you would think that it would run on batteries but they are only for shipping and the demo mode...makes no sense to me. the buttons do not wok properly, you have to mash them several times to make the connection."
1,Stopped working in two weeks,"I used it for baby's naptime and nighttime, and it was working good. I didn't use all sorts of sounds, just rain sound worked fine. After using for two weeks it suddenly stopped making sound. It was operated as instructed in users manual, not in demo mode, and I used plug in, not batteries. So I contacted the company by email. The receptionist responded asking what happened and I described exactly what happened. After about a month, no response, so I inquired the status. The receptionist answered that they are processing request and replacement parts would be shipped to me. So I waited. Still no parts after four months. I could have returned it to amazon before the return window closed. I am very disappointed."
1,Stopped working after a month,I liked this when it worked. Unfortunately it stopped working after a month. It will make sound for a second and then switch off. Unfortunate since I did like the noise it made.
2,for toddler's room...not great,"I like the variations of sounds and that you can combine them. Most, however, have, as someone else said, distractingly short loops. I actually like ""Rain,"" but many others keep me up at night through his monitor. My son would play with it for an hour if I let him. But it is very quiet and not good for covering other noises, which is kind of the purpose as far as we're concerned. Also, the volume control buttons are annoying slow to adjust."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!,"This item broke after about a week of use. Before it stopped working, we weren't happy with the volume and a number of other items. I DO NOT recommend!"
2,Not loud enough,"Nice form factor and good sounds, only it could not get very loud. We returned it and bought the Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, which we are very happy with."
2,Not the best 'sound' machine,"I like the sounds this product makes. I just wish it went louder. We use these in our younger two children's rooms. We use it so we don't have to tip toe throughout the rest of the house when they are asleep. However, they are not loud enough to drown out our sounds. Our son is a heavy sleeper so it's fine for him, but our daughter is a light sleeper and this is not loud enough for her room."
1,It would be great if you could hear it...,"The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me."
5,Wonderful!!,"This item is wonderful!! I bought this for my baby when she was just a few weeks old to help her sleep. The womb sound is her favorite. She is now 18 months and we still use it. She enjoys ""helping"" me turn it on every night!I have read other reviews about it being too quiet, but we have never had that problem. I can hear this in my own bedroom...it's great for drowning out noise.I recommend this to everyone that I know who is having a baby."
1,Not loud enough,I bought this yesterday to replace a noise machine I have that uses just batteries. I used this one for a night but am returning it today. It doesn't get nearly loud enough to block out any noise. I would prefer to just keep buying batteries so the machine is loud enough rather than use this one that doesn't block any sound. Not sure why you would need so many choices in sounds either. That just seems to be an extra for no reason. My baby uses one sound (ocean) and I don't think would benefit from switching that with other noises. The only benefit to this machine is that you can plug it in. That's not good enough to use it though.
1,Weak sound,"Maybe this device is for newborns only, and maybe we waited too late to try it out on our 4 month old. But this thing is not loud enough, and the choices for sound are weak, pathetic attempts at recreating nature. And Thunder? Why would you include that? The only reason it didn't scare our baby is because it can't get loud enough. I'm going to return this thing, with a vengeance. I'll keep looking, but I wonder if there's nothing better than good ol' static on the AM dial."
2,Terrible sound quality - returned it,"I give this product 2 stars rather than one because I really did like the selection of sounds and the option to combine them. The unit itself was small and lightweight enough to travel with. However, the sound quality was terrible. I almost wonder if I got a defective product, or if they are really just that bad. The timer/on/off switch made a static noise whenever I moved it, almost like it had a short. The highest volume setting was surprisingly quiet. For a product that is all about making sound, the quality of the sound was pathetic."
1,"poor sounds, not loud enough","The volume doesn't get loud enough to drown out any outside noise. Also, the sounds fluctuate way to much, going from soft to kind of loud back to soft again. This won't keep my daughter asleep if an outside noise (phone, dog barking, etc.) happens during the soft cycle. The rain sound is pretty constant, but still not loud enough. I ended up returning the machine and downloading an mp3 of white noise that sounds more like a constant static. I made lots of copies and put them on my iPod and run that in her room now. It works great and I can really crank the volume up if I need to."
1,Can barely hear the noise on this machine,The maximum noise level on this machine is very low. It is not going to block out traffic noises in a city or even furnace noises. I have other Marpac and Connair noise machines in the house that perform much better at covering up other nighttime noises.
2,Too quiet,"The sounds are nice and I like the fact that you can combine sounds, like thunder and rain. Problem is that it's just way too quiet. If you're trying to block out other sounds then you want it, but if you just need a little something to soothe you then it's very nice. It's fun for playing pretend with the kids too."
3,Not for adults or smart children,"The reason I am on here is because after using this in our kids bedroom for a few years, I have finally started using it for myself and found it quite annoying. Although when demoing it seems like a good product, most of the sounds are too repetitive and actually keep me from falling asleep. What I am basically looking for now is a sound machine with a good rain setting. The one on this unit repeats like every 3 seconds."
5,Lifesaver,"I had a demanding 4 week old, who had to be held all the time. Once she fell asleep, it was tempting fate to put her down without waking her up. I was desperate for something...anything. After 2 weeks of routine (bath, lotion, feeding with lights low and the womb sound playing), we can feed her, put her in her crib while she is still awake, and she puts herself to sleep. She sleeps a good 5-7 hours with the womb sound on. We believe this product has made all the difference. I love that it can be plugged in or run on batteries. It has multiple sounds and you can play 2 at the same time (i.e., ocean and seagulls). I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Not loud enough - I should have listened to the reviewers,"I returned this product after using it for 1 night in my 2-year old's room. I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the volume. I had it on the highest volume and I needed it to go up 1 or 2 more notches. If you want something that can block outdoor noises such as loud birds or trash trucks in the morning, or indoor noises such as siblings in the same room, then I don't recommend purchasing this product. On the plus side, the product is very light, would be easy to travel with, and has a large selection of sounds, if those features are important to you."
1,Voulme is so SOFT that it's absurd.,"I had read the reviews for this noisemaker, and had heard that somepeople had complained the volume was too soft - however, there seemed to be enough reviews to the contrary to give me the confidence to buy this.I can not stress this enough. This. product. is. barely. audible.On it's highest volume, it's practically useless.I will be returning this immediately."
3,Poor Volume,"While it has a lot of variety in sounds it is NOT loud enough. Thankfully I only have to use it while traveling, but I'm looking for something else at this point."
2,"It works, but...it's very quiet!","We bought this for our 16 month old to try to wean her off of the fan we had been using for white noise. However we were very disappointed by the volume of this sound machine. The sounds are great, but it's simply very quiet and doesn't cover up normal household noises outside her bedroom door.I would not recommend this product for this reason alone."
1,Where's the noise?!?!?!,"Pretty simple, this simply isn't loud enough. Not that I want to turn my nursery into a rock concert, but the volume on this simply doesn't go very high. We bought this because it was highly rated, now I have to go buy a replacement."
4,Nice variety of sounds but not realistic,"The description lists that the machine allows 2 sounds to be combined... only some sounds can be combined... you can combine most of the water sounds with bird sounds or other beeping type. The thunder sound in good but the womb sound is more like a broken radio. We've been using the machine with our 14 month old for the last few months and he sleeps longer when it is on and goes to sleep sooner. My main issues with it are those described above and that it doesn't have a memory... when yo turn it off then back on it goes back to a default, not the combination of sounds and volume level you had it on last."
2,Nothing beats a fan!,"I love having a fan on in the room when I am sleeping, but bringing home a preemie in January meant I had to turn off the fan for a while. So I bought this, and it's OK. I use it, but I wish I had a different one.My biggest gripe is that I have to constantly set it to the settings I want, each night. I use the same settings every time, the same noise, volume, etc, and yet I have to reset those every night. I wish it would start on the last settings you had. It only takes a couple seconds, but it's annoying!I use the wind sound for white noise, it works OK.In all, I could have bought a simpler one, but there are so many out there, I finally just picked one. Now that it's warmer, I'm going back to the fan!"
3,"Good for the price, but wouldn't get again","We have 3 sound makers - one from 7 yrs ago that we like (which we can't find anymore), a Marpac Sleepmate that we LOVE, and this one. My main complaints on this model are: 1) the sounds aren't always loud enough, (2) the sound loop is about 3 seconds on some of the sounds, which is horribly distracting when you're trying to fall asleep, and (3) sometimes I can pick up a ""thumping"" noise in the sound loop, especially in rain mode, which again is terribly distracting. So, it might be worth the price, but after 8 yrs of using sound makers I'd rather spent the extra $20 and got another Marpac Sleepmate. It doesn't have a variety of sounds but you can adjust the sound fairly easily, plus I love it on trips.Marpac 980A Sound Screen Sleep Conditioner White Noise Generator Dual Speed"
2,"Great concept, but getting returned","I love the concept behind this. My son uses a white noise machine to fall asleep and we wanted one for our baby due next month. I liked what I read about being able to mix sounds. First of all, you can only mix certain sounds together - not whatever you want. But, the real reason this is getting returned is that it is way too quiet. Even at it's loudest, there is no way it will block out noises. My husband and I could whisper near it when it was on full volume, and still hear each other just fine. This one goes back!"
2,"Not worth $20, key shortcomings",I have three of these for my three kids' rooms. After a while they begin to whine when on the wind setting which is the only one which has steady sound. Also the volume doesn't go high enough. I'm buying three new ones and throwing these away.
3,Average,"I'll give this product an average rating. The sound options are great, the ability to run the product on either batteries or electricity is great (esp. if you travel), but the maximum volume is not so good. It's not loud enough for what we would like. We have a humidifier that does the job better, but don't want or need to run it all the time. So, while this product has some nice features, it doesn't block out some/many of the sounds between one room and the next. It's merely an additional noise to whatever else is going on rather than something that muffles or puts into the background all the other sounds. But, perhaps that's all the manufacturer intended!"
2,"Not loud enough, one broke immediately","Well, I am still using one unit I bought because I like the rain setting for my 2 month old but I have concerns. I inadvertantly purchased two units, the first is still working but is not able to reach volumes to initially calm my infant, and it lacks a true ""white noise"" setting or a ""fan"" setting, which I hoped it would have. It occaisionally makes a loud popping sound, too. The secound unit stopped working immediately (after 2 uses of 20 minutes each)."
1,Skip it! NO VOLUME!,Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out. I returned it immediately.
2,Not loud enough to be effective,"I have used noise machines for all three of my kids for years. When my 3 year olds ""noise"" finally gave out he chose this one off of Amazon. sadly it is not nearly loud enough to be effective. I am returning it and will go with the more expensive but more effective Graco model."
3,It's OK,"My title says it all, it's OKSounds tend to have a loop that can be heard, hard to explain, but if you have very sensitive hearing, this one may not be for you."
2,Not loud enough,I am a mother who swears by sound machines. I purched this machine and it is too soft. Our other machines are much louder and more effective. the homedics one is a better choice
2,You can hear a pin drop when this is on....,"Ok, perhaps you can't hear a pin drop, but the highest volume on this machine is still pretty quiet. On second thought, that may be a good thing since the sound choices on this unit are all pretty unpleasant - very mechanical sounding at best, and the ""womb"" choice sounds like the background to an alien invasion movie or something. I am totally disapointed with this cheap looking, low quality item."
2,great sound options - way too quiet,"I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly. However, this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise. You have to put the thing directly into an infant's crib (making the cord a choking hazard) in order for them to even hear it. If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house, you need something a lot louder."
2,not loud enough,"For a baby with colic or a child with sensory integration issues, this machine is not loud enough at its highest volume."
3,Sound sleeper not loud enough,"Great sounds from the Sound Sleeper, but the volume wasn't as loud enough.I was looking for something that would drown out the loud noise of our household but it did not work at all. I also got this after my daughter was 4 months old and it might be better suited for a newborn? She didn't not find the noises comforting."
2,Not loud enough,"Bought it for my 9 months old's nursery room to drown out other noises in the house in the evening. It's not loud enough at all even with the highest volume setting, so I returned it."
5,"Lots of variety, nice sounds!","We are expecting our second child in November and thought this might be a nice choice for a soother.Last time we had a mommy bear which worked wonders but only offered the one sound(womb).This product has many sounds,settings,volume levels so it gives you more choices.You can combine the sounds or play at random,if you choose too!We believe this product will be helpful to help calm and sooth our little boy."
5,very helpful!,"I don't have a baby yet, but I bought this for myself to block out household and outdoor noises. I like that you can combine sounds for a little variety."
1,"not loud enough, bum ac adapter","I received this in the mail today, unfortunately it's already back in the box for return. I bought it to help my baby sleep and block out the noises in the house from her room. I plugged it in and tried to set it down and it immediately turned off. I tried again and touched the AC adapter cord and it cut off again. When I was able to get it to stay on for longer than a few seconds, the loudest volume setting was way too low."
3,Not as great for adults,"I realize this Dex sound machine is marketed towards parents for use with their babies, but I bought one to create some ""white noise"" for an office. It's inexpensive, simple to use, and came with batteries and an AC adaptor. There really is no ""white noise"" setting although ""wind"" is close. Most of the other sounds have a very canned digital sound. In fairness to the manufacturer, this machine would probably be excellent for soothing babies. Babies aren't as fussy about fidelity and sound quality."
2,not loud enough,"I bought this to block out sounds (I live near a busy street), and it just isn't loud enough. Even on the highest setting, my baby wakes up with every truck that goes by.If you live in a quiet neighborhood this might be enough, but it really doesn't get loud enough for me."
1,Poor quality sound and too quiet.,"I bought it for myself after reading other reviews saying that adults were also pleased with this product. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. There is a static background for some sounds. Do not expect it to cover outside noises because it is the opposite. The highest volume setting is so quiet that the machine sounds are covered by all surrounding noises and it gets really bothering. I would return it if it wasn't so much hassle."
2,quite disappointing,"I rarely write a review but this item really upsets me. I researched before buying. Maybe that's why I am more disappointed than usual. Of course sleepless because of baby wouldn't stay asleep didn't help me to be calm either. This machine broke down after one and half month of use! The machine turned on, just to stop after 5 seconds! It's so annoying. Why not just stop working completely!? To add to the complain, is the sound level being very low. I have to put it on a chair closely next to her crib for it to work ok. We still need to tip toe around the room and ask people not to ring the door bell, ect. Lousy product."
3,"Very quiet, not loud enough to drown out noise","We bought this sound machine for our baby's room. This is our 4th sound machine in the last 10 years, and we were disappointed with this one because it is so quiet. You would have to place it close to your head to drown out other noises. There is a great selection of sounds and features, so if your house is a quiet one, this may work for you."
3,Good For The Price,"This is a good sound machine for the price. Previously, I had been using my iPod to play a continuous loop of background noise. So, especially compared to that, this sound machine doesn't produce a very clear sound (i.e., high static noises) and is not very loud. Having said that, I paid $20 for this item and, for that price, it's great. It's portable and it does it's job well enough."
4,perfect for babies/toddlers,"I finally bought this after searching for something cheaper. My almost 2 year old has had my TIMEX sound/cd alarm clock since she was born and i decided it was time to get something just for her.this has a variety of sounds and works great to drown out noise after she goes to sleep.the only thing that i don't like about it is that after you turn it off and then turn it on again you have to click the sound you want. it doesn't stay on wind noise even though that is the one i always use. not a hug deal, just one more step. my husband didn't notice and surprisingly one night she slept through the default one which i think is a stream/river type sound.anyway, this is a great find and you can't beat the price!"
5,Now I can sleep,This was great to find and it works great. If you can't sleep this will do the trick. Good buy!!
4,Good Buy,"Yes it's not as loud as you'd think it might be but come on you are putting it in a kids room, how loud do you really need it to be?I personally do like this. I like that you can choose which sounds go together. Our personal favorite is Ocean & Bouy.I love that you can run it all night, just in case your little one starts to get up during the night."
2,Not worth it,"This sound machine is too quiet to even make it worth owning. And all the sound combinations are just silly. You don't really need something this complicated, in my opinion. Used it for a couple days and had to use another machine at the same time just to actually drown out any sound outside my baby's room. No good."
2,Too quiet,"I bought this for white noise to help me sleep.(I usually use a fan on low, but mine had died and none of the stores were carrying fans as they are a ""seasonal"" item.)I wanted to love this, with the different sound options, but it was just too quiet. :(Not sure it would be enough white noise to keep a baby to sleep either."
2,couldn't stand the fragrance,I tried using this for about a month but just couldn't stand the smell. It also broke out my skin on my forehead where I'm a little oily. I wouldn't recommend it for combination skin.
2,I am a little disappointed,"I am 29 years of age and I truly was hoping that this product will work at leat ok based on other reviews. I was not expecting a miracle, but at least some mild results, but I was truly disappointed. I purchased this derma e peptides and the night version too; but it did not work. It has some kind of consistency that ""temporarily"" gives the impresion that is working, but soon I found out that it was an illusion. It seems to cover some mild wrinkles but the effect is gone in probably two hours (I can obtain this result with good makeup). Oh well, good luck to all of you, I am sure that there must be something out there I just have to keep trying!"
5,I love this cream!,I use it in combination with Skinceuticals CE/CE Ferulic NIB and it works great. My wrinkles have almost disappeared!! I especially noticed around my lips and forehead. I'm placing my second order now.
5,Another great Derma e Product!!,"Great for sensitive skin, but actually has an effect! In only a few days, I don't have those little crepey lines around my mouth! I sent back some very expensive products to one of those network shopping places after getting this product! I can compare this to some other skin creams I have paid over $100 for! Seriously, this is scary! I am trying several other Derma e products as they are great bargains and very high quality. This stuff works! (We all need to review when we buy, because I only bought when I read others' reviews! Come on ""gals"", review the beauty items when you buy!!)"
2,Feels great.. but does NOT work,"I use only at night as it's very rich and seems to curdle a bit if I put to much on in the morning.I have found after using this product for about 4 months straight, nothing is really slowing the process down. I'm still getting the crows feet, I have not noticed any lines diminished.I don't want to give it a 2 star, but I have no choice as I am editing a post I added a long time ago.It is just an expensive moisturiser, it won't help you get rid of the lines, I was hoping it would, as I'm 55, but it's a scam.... sorry but it's the truth, I tried it for over 4 months to make sure I was right...So I will keep on looking for the 'miracle' furmula... this is not it..."
5,derma e Peptites Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme,"I was looking for a good eye and face moisturizer that had the ingredients that I was looking for and this fits the bill. My skin is brighter the darkening circles I seem to get in the winter have faded and I just love how it makes my skin feel. I don't have any wrinkles so can't offer up any insignt in that area, but this creme is great and a little bit goes a long way."
4,Something's Happening,I'm 56 and have been a sun lover and outdoor person my whole life but as you can imagine it took its tole on my skin. Since using this product I have decreased the deepest lines and wrinkles and have obliterated the lesser wrinkles. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I don't think any cream can take it all away.
5,My all time favorite moisturizer!,"I have been using this for years, and was so happy to find it on Amazon at half the price I was paying. My best friend, who is in the natural food and other products industry, told me this had the 'cleanest' ingredients of any product she had ever seen. I constantly get complimented on my skin. At 51, that's quite a treat!"
5,Derma e,"I absolutely love this stuff, I wear it day and night, under makeup or without. It's not greasy, absorbs quickly and never feels heavy. I have noticed that my fine lines are finer and softer wrinkles.its not a miracle cream, but does a decent job!"
2,never seems to completely absorb,"After buying the day and night creams, I was terribly disappointed.I hated the feel of this cream/serum. Maybe I'm using it wrong; everybody else seems to like it. I tried it for two weeks, and after it finally dried it left a sticky, filmy layer on my skin.I have combination skin, and am in my 50's, I didn't expect a miracle, but it never seemed to completely absorb. Wasted my money!"
2,"Jane Austen Audio collection part 1 ""complete""",I have listened to Jane Austen biography and Northanger Abbey.While I was listening I realized that the books had been abridged. I could not find that on the listing for the item on Amazon. It is written on very fine print on side of large box that contains all the discs. I was very disappointed.I only give this 2 stars because they have married music with the text in a very unique way.
2,Think Again,"I love Jane Austen and having her works all together in a single collection is a great idea. The problem with this set is that the books are abridged. It's a little hard to notice at first, but it is a problem for me. I wish that the publisher of this collection had put this information in larger print so that I would have known before I purchased. I am glad the price was not too high. Better luck next time. The idea is great, but the execution is not the best. The idea gets five stars, but the abridged versions bring it back to two."
3,Decent collection but wish they didn't put the music in there.,"I liked this collection of Jane Austen's works only they were abridged which I didn't really care for. Austen's works are timeless and abridging them seems a terrible waste. Also, I didn't care for the music that was added. Overall the collection was okay though."
1,This game stinks,"This game is one of the worst game I've ever seen in years! I know that I'll get a lot of angry reviewers against me, but I don't care. The reason I hate this game so much is because I need a killer machine and super-speed-connection to run this boring game smoothly, and the graphics and sounds aren't great at all...bunch of lame, boring game features, uninteresting multiplay, simple textures, simple maps(having lots of maps doesn't means that this has the best maps)...This game is complete trash! Don't waste your money on this, buy diablo ll instead..."
3,Do you want a game of 1Gb ?,"Yes, that's the size of it fully installed! Ok, it's cool and all, but not that much different to justify this huge size. I liked a lot DF 1 (not DF2) , Hidden and Dangerous in spite of the crashes, Swat 3 etc, but this is just a Doom improved. It's also hard to configure even in my Pentium II 333 with 96 ram and Viper 770 32Mb. I don't recommend."
1,Booooooooooooooo!,"I have not played the full version of UT, but I can take a guess at what it would be like. I have, however ""played"" the demo. The reason I put played in quotes is the game was a slug. It seemed to stop to load every three seconds or so. I don't whether it was an issue with my system, but something can definitely be said about a game which loads constantly. Even if the game did work on my computer, I still would not like it. I lknow this because I played a working version (it still loaded too often) at another person's house. There is no storyline and no character involovment. I like a little story to follow along. UT and Quake 3 are the shallowest games I've ever played. All they are is run, shoot, run, shoot, run, shoot. This gets boring nearly immediatly for me."
1,Bah humbug,"I got both UT and Q3A for christmas and was more excited to play UT. I booted it up and started playing and about 20 minutes later uninstalled it and put Q3A in. Trust me-Quake 3 Arena is much better, dont waste you money."
5,Best online game,"Buy this game. Best online gaming experience I have had. I thought Quake was good, but it pales in comparison to Unreal Tournament. So many different gaming variations. I love ""assualt"", you attack your enemies' compound. Kill them all and let God sort them out!"
5,FREE ONLINE PLAY whats not to like....,"I love this game, been playing it since 2001 and I love it. You just need to download the newest patch and you are ready to go. You can still find free online servers with hundreds of people playing all over the world.Don't hesitate to pick up one of the most fun games EVER!One word of caution is that the players on most servers are topnotch so you may want to train a little with the bots on your movements and maybe just do the sniper servers for a while till you get the hang of things."
5,Great Game,"This game is by far one of the best First person shooters out there. The graphics are good and the game has a variety of weapons, levels and game modes to play with. Multiplayer support is very good since you can set up your own little server and also play on HEAT, Mplayer and WON. The AI works out pretty well, the bots are easy until the skill level is set above Masterful. If you like to play first person shooters this is a game you won't regret buying."
5,You'll grin.,"Buy the game. Thats all i really have to say. Take my word for it, once you sit down with this, you'll find yourself either an estatic hardcore fragger or a ""sophisticated"" gamer, grinning ear to ear despite telling yourself you hate these bloodfest games. Its just that fun. And yes, the graphics are second to none, and yes, to get the full effect, i suppose to you need some pretty heavy duty hardware, i run it on a properly memory/cache tuned PII 450, 128mb RAM, w/a 16mb Velocity 4400 and a 12mb VooDoo2 and noticed no slowdown at all. But this game ain't just eye candy...Internet play is *nice*, even on my hokey 56k modem. You'll be begging your friends to get the game too. You get an excellent single player slaughterhouse game (great for relieving office stress!), and get a few buddies in the game plus a comm program like Roger Wilco? Get ready for some pure vanilla, special ops style tail whuppin'."
4,An objective view from an old Ut player,"Some of the reviews above suggest a monster machine to run this game, a good PII with a good graphics card (vodoo 2 - 12 mb and above) will provide you with nice gameplay. The biggest bore in FPS is running around endless corridors, UT has the graphics engine to run games in quite spectacular and open arenas. The game itself played OFF the internet is a lot of fun with a lot of different ways of playing. I have seen a couple of very minor glitches in the AI of the bots on a couple of maps, which will be fixed in a patch shortly I hear. Q3A isn't on the shelves yet so I can't compare, but certainly to date UT is by a very long way the most impressive FPS you can find, I suspect that only the most demanding and experienced player will find any fault with it at all. Overall very enjoyable, great graphics, sounds, and plenty of versions of gameplay with AI on the bots you can tweak makes for many hours of fun."
4,GoRE GORE wait no GORE?,This Game has so mmuch gore in it it made me SICK!! im only 16 and i think the way U can dismember a gguys/aliens limb or other body parts is just sick!With the gore off its pretty fun espesily with multiplayer! but with SOME VERSOINS of the game U have to download a special patch witch takes bout and hour and 5 minutes so OTHER than the GORE!! it's a pretty fun game and word to your parents NO GORE TURN IT OFF your KIDS WILL GET SICK!!!
1,this game sucks,"When I got this game I played it for about 2 days and decided it sucks.Then after a couple of weeks I played it again because some friends said it was cool. I thought I should give it another chance and I played it with friends, but the game just doesn't appeal to me.It's quake 1/2/3 for me! (even though 3 was a bit disappointing).I don't get how everyone just seems to like UT.This is the game that got me back to playing games that actually have a story."
4,Good Deathmatch,"This game is quite good. Has a lot of eye candy that can take away from the Deathmatch experience, but plays very well. If you can only get one first person shooter I would recomend Quake 3 Arena, but if you can get two, this would be my second recomendation."
4,"If you like every-man-for-himself deathmatch, this is it.","Unreal Tournament is and example of the direction leading edge PC games are going. This game has great graphics, nice high-tech ambience, and some ingenious levels to play in. However, the team play in this game is not as good as those as ""Team Fortress Classic"" or ""Starsiege: TRIBES,"" but for pure deathmatch, and some off-ine play with the best AI in a first-person shooter to date, get this game."
4,Move over Quake3 Arena here is Unreal Tournament !,"Look here it is in a nutshell quake was the standard but it got old .....unreal tourny breathes new life into this format of game . Intense maps, Powerful Weapons, And many variations of the deathmatch genre. A cool voice messaging Feature allows you to send canned voice commands to taunt your enemys or command teamates. The bots in single player have adjustable skill levels and are quite good for computer AI, and deathmatch code seems fairly good as well allowing for pretty reliable connections via internet. I've been a big quake ,doom multiplayer for many years and i am quite impressed with this game,it is a MUST buy for fans of the first person shooter...."
1,"Nice game, but overrated","Well, I can't deny that this game is a good 3d action first person shooting game, but I didn't enjoyed this game so much. And even though there was a good variety of game features, none of them seemed interesting to me, and the graphics wasn't so cool compared to quake 3. Weapons; probably one of the best variety of weapons for this kinda game, but the sounds [were lacking]. And the lightning effects wasn't so impressive. Bots, cool AL, very impressive; better than Q3. Deathmatch, not so good. Assult and Domination wasn't so fun either. Team Deathmatch and Capture the flag were the best game features in my opinion. Anyways, I'm giving this game one star because this game is too overrated. Anyways, it's a good game; I just don't like this game so much, that's all."
1,Horrible game!,"I don't know what everyone else sees in this game and why they consider it so addicting and cool, it, like Quake 3 is just mindless shooting only leaving you angry. Everyone in the UT community rocket jumps, a cheap way of getting a quick kill, and very annoying at the same time. This game is plagued with rocket jumping! There are alot of things I hate about this game, too many to list here anyway."
1,The one star made you read mine didnt it,"This game rules. I really think that this game is a 5 star. If you havent played this game, go do that now."
1,EVIL!!!,Very evil game and its bloody sick game. You have to be evil to play it I mean go get blues clues and soothe your mind! DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS PLAY THIS EVIL GAME.PS It was made in china
3,"A decent game, but overrated","One word comes to mind when I think of UT. That is ""throwback"". The level design is reminiscent of Quake 2. The rocket launcher looks very similar. The female characters with their hair waving look the same as those in Q2. Health and armor do not diminish over time, also as in Q2 (changed for Q3, for a number of reasons). Epic took a formula that worked, and made another game out of it, using an old (but still pretty) game engine. if you want to unwind and have a good time, fire up Unreal Tournament and join a laggy server (I have a T3 connection. With Q3 i get dozens of servers under a ping of 40 ms. With UT, the best i can ever find is 80 something), or create a botmatch. That's really the most fun you'll have with this game. If you want a game that will really last, and one that you can feel yourself improving in, and take a bit more pride out of the first time you win a game, buy Q3."
5,Just as good as Quake but better levels,"This game consisted of two awesome items, first was the improvement that it has made from the first unreal. Second are the detailed and highly entertaining multiplayer levels. You could play in them for hours. I say its a bit better than quake but they are both great games"
1,BAD PRODUCT,"Iam very unsatisfied with this product .It was waste of money ,It did not work at all,and I did contact the seller to retern it but they just simply said ""NO"" and send me an e-mail about how I should insall the game,we did but still is not working.So I never again buy any kind of game or elctronics from amazon."
2,"Hard to install, harder to troubleshoot","This game has been a real pain to get up and running. The error messages are obscure and meaningless (unless you're a hacker or a geek), the documentation is targeted to engineers, and the web support link again makes huge assumptions about the technical ability of the end user. HELLO! Do not make me dive into the innards of my PCs operating system to play your game, or at least make it easy for me to reconfigure what's necessary. Unless you spend your waking hours coding, I would keep clear of this game."
5,Buy it Now if you have a brain,"This game just rocks. a perfect solution for those who needsomething to hold us over until team fortress 2 (unreal fortress, amod out soon for the game). i strongly recomend this one as it has excelent everything, great gameplay, control, the works. forget Quake 3: Arena this kicks its ....! END"
4,"Great product, poor packaging.","Just so future buyers know, these are delivered in a plain cardboard box open. No plastic bag, not even a waxed box.I'm no germaphobe, but considering these get dragged through all kinds of environments during shipping, I don't think I will ordering them again, especially for $7 a pound."
2,literary criticism,"This is literary criticism and analysis, not biography - though there is some good biography in the first two chapters. For me, I was mistaken in thinking it was Baker's biography of H."
2,Stotts Pilates: intermediate matwork,"A good example of basic Pilates moves but, just did not hold my attention. I prefer pick you level Pilates."
4,Ricky Carmichael championship Motocross,"I gave this game a four because it does not allow the user to create their own tracks and it does not have real bikes. For instance, they should have Yamaha, Honda and Suzuki, but they have Hamaha or something like that. I think the game play is GREAT! I find myself playing this game over and over again. Allowing users to create tracks would add to the longevity of the game. In my opinion, this game has the best game play of all the motocross or supercross games out there. If you rent this game, you will end up buying it."
3,"VERY DIFFICULT TO THE POINT OF NOT FUN, RENT FIRST","ITS A FUN GAME WITH VERY REALISTIC HANDLING AND PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE BIKES. AS A MOTO XER MYSELF I ENJOY IT. THE ANALOG SHOCK ADDS TO IT. HOWEVER I ONLY RATED IT AS A THREE BECAUSE ITS INCREDIBLY HARD. GOOD LUCK GETTING PAST A RACE OR TWO, EVEN IN THE 125CC CLASS. OVERALL I'D SAY RENT FIRST, BUY LATER IF YOU LIKE IT."
1,very disappointed,"I ordered a used playstation game. It came very quickly. But it was not the motorcross game my grandson wanted, it was a music CD. I have since returned it. After 4 e-mails. Provide your Order # and we will refund. Return the product and we will refund. Return to where? Heres an address. I will be surprised when and if I get a credit."
2,Definitely not a five star romance,"I was reading the other reviews, and I can't believe anyone thought this was a five star romance. It was depressing, and I'm convinced the main characters didn't laugh once in the whole novel. Claudia was annoying, and I couldn't understand her reasons for resisting Julian. Julian was an excellent ""hero"" and that is what is making me give this book 2 stars. The last few pages were the only good pages in the novel. Overall, this book is not worth reading if your looking for a little romantic pick-me-up."
3,Another heart-rending story from Julia London,"This is a another very enjoyable story from Julia London. It isn't a classic, in my opinion, because of the misunderstandings that get a little monotonous at times. But its a very worth while read, none the less."
3,Cruel,"This book had some interesting twists and turns, some leading to desperate situations, some that had me wondering how could such mess ever be resolved. Even in the beginning the story was a bit heavy, a recent death standing between the heroes and keeping them apart. The hero was amazing, very patient, loving and giving, and often far too good to the heroine, who mostly behaved like an adolescent, thinking she is always right and that she can do anything she wants. Well, of course things turn out ugly, and the hero is there to save her, but she keeps pushing him away until it is almost too late. She was so stubborn! In the end, I had the feeling that there were simply too many ugly things between them and that they could never be happy together. The ending was not as satisfying as it could be.PS: There really was no need to explain so many times how very ruthlessly charming the hero is. It gets old."
3,mediocre,I wasn't all that impressed with this book. I've read Julia London's previous books (which were absolutely fantastic!) and the Ruthless Charmer wasn't charming at all. It seemed that the story concentrated more on Sophie's predicament and not on Claudia and Julian. Overall though it wasn't such a bad book. It just didn't grab my attention after a few pages and it took a while for me to finish it because it lacked magic in it.
1,Not a good romance story,"I loved the first book 'The Dangerous Gentleman' and I couldn't wait to read this one. What a mistake. I wished I had brought it second hand or borrowed it. I like exciting, romantic stories - this was not one of those. I didn't like the way the two main characters were written and was disappointed with the storyline, also women getting beaten up is not my idea of a good read. I don't even want to read the third and final book. I hope that Julia London's 'The Devil's love' and 'Wicked Angel' are much better than this.If you want exciting romantic stories stick with Stephanie Laurens and Julia Quinn"
3,3rd of the Rogues,This is the 3rd book of the Rogues of Regents Series. It was ok light reading. It didn't hold my attention to the point that I couldn't put it down. I guess it was the times when the men didn't listen to women and thought when they made a decision it was accepted without question.I would have like to see more interactions with the three Rogues in the 2nd and 3rd book.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is one of a series, called the Rogues of Regent Street. I was expecting a light, frothy Regency romance. Instead, this is a historical novel, set in the 1830s, with a strong feminist slant that sees women as victims. The central female characters move through the novel subject to the legal control of the males around them. One subplot explores the lack of legal protection for married women in abusive relationships. This is a strong novel with a lot of violence. I have rated it two stars only. This is a feminist commentary-I was looking for something else."
2,2nd in the series of Rogues,I loved the first book and couldn't wait to read this one. I was really disappointed. I finished it but it did not capture me as the first one. I have yet to read the 3rd in the series do to being so disappointed with this one.
2,Too Little Information,This book was disappointingly thin on information and way over priced. It's not worth $19.95; maybe $4.95.
5,Mind Coach: How to Teach Children & Teenagers to Think Positive & Feel Good (,"This book by Dr. Amen does a great job in explaining automatic negative thoughts and how they influence our brain. I have used it with children, youth, and most recently my women's group. Learning to recognize negative words in our daily communication and knowing how to change our communication is clearly explained. This is a great little book."
1,just a repeat of his other books,"If you have any of his other books, skip this one...just a repeat of them and all of the info is in the other books. If you don't plan on buying any of his books, then yes, this is a good book to get."
5,Essential,"Pure Punk reminiscant of Guttermouth and Nofx. I saw Beefcake recently when they had gotten back together(The guitarist now plays in the Ataris). The show captivated all the energy on the album. The music is catchy, the lyrics are hilarious, and this has been in my player since i got it. Bad Punk with humor-how can you go wrong? Pick it up- give it a few listens and you'll be hooked. Make sure to see them too."
4,"Good, basic information for beginners.","This book is a good source of information for people interested in learning how to use a map and compass. It is easy to read, simple to follow, and contains accurate information. As a search and rescue instructor, I've used the concepts in this book to teach map and compass skills to hundreds of teen-aged students."
2,predictable and shallow,"Author Rose Wilkins brags on the back flap that this book was written as a bet: she worked at a publishing house reading submissions that were so bad that she was sure she could do better. Unfortunately, it's all too obvious that she was inspired by bad writing!Her characterizations are shallow and predictable, and her dialog is unrealistic. My guess this is Ms. Wilkins' idea of what she imagines teenagers wish their lives were like: Octavia's the outcast, yes, but she's rich and privileged, the daughter of famous parents who always has a snappy comeback at the ready. Even in her awkward moments, Octavia is sure of herself. It's all just too easy, and no real emotion comes through in the writing.My suggestion to Ms. Wilkins is to try again but this time get yourself inspired by some GOOD YA authors--try Megan McCafferty, Sonya Sones, Celia Moriarty for starters."
5,Tango Instruction series,This series is among the best I have seen in ballroom dance instruction. Attending milongas (get togethers devoted to Argentinian tango)has been difficult without an understanding of the basics. This three part series develops the confidence you need to attend milongas.
3,Very Basic,This is useful for people just starting out. He is very thorough in his instruction. It is quite useful for beginners.
2,Boring!,"After seeing 'Forever Tango', I fell in love with Argentine Tango. I took a few lessons at the local Dance Studio. After reading all the mostly great reviews of this DVD series I ordered Vol.2 & 3. I received them today and started watching Vol.3. The steps are very simple and easy to learn but boy....the instructors have no facial expression what so ever. Argentine Tango is all about Passion and I see NONE on this DVD.I kept hoping to see the full force of Argentine Tango at the end of the lesson, well...that did not happen. I lost interest very quickly watching this DVD. I am afraid to watch Vol.2, I'm thinking of returning them. I don't think it's worth the price."
2,Flash! Garage Band Mutilates Beatles!,"I was really looking forward to listening to this disk. I remember some of the original ""lost"" songs sung by other artists who maintained the sweet and well-crafted feel of a Paul McCartney song.Instead, this CD sounds like a hastily thrown together project where nobody bothered to clean up the off-key harmonies. Even a whistled section is off-key, for pete's sake! Graham Parker and Kate Pierson have done some great work, but this is not it. Their voices are off-key, weak, and gritty. The production sounds like a matter of fact, portable digital-4track-whatever-is-recorded-we'll-use. . .To paraphrase an old classical music joke: Parker, Pierson and Janovitz played McCartney today. . . .McCartney lost.David Hartman"
1,pretty aweful,"Just aweful....I'm vegetarian, and I'm used to soy productsand generally love all of them. however this stuff was justaweful. Pungent with a dirty garden hose water aftertaste...Some things take getting used to, but I can't even imagine getting usedto this, its nothing like the coffee taste I love.I would say AVOID unless you had this before and know what your getting.Sadly I bought 5 lbs of this.Back to Millstone chocolate velvet and / decaf mixing......"
5,One of the bests,"One of the best games of racing that I've ever played!! The sim is very true and extremely difficult to control. A lot of practice is needed, but that is why it is interesting!! A almost true sim!!"
2,Copyright keeps crashing machine. Be sure to reboot! I will NOT be getting DIRT 2.,"Sorry, but they did a crappy job on this one. They dumped the console game into this and did not even pretend to rework a single thing.Forget using your mouse. The console is the only way to move. If you go in and change the settings, then REBOOT! If you try to launch the game again without rebooting your computer, the copyright kicks in and thinks you are trying to launch a second game. This is probably why so many people are complaining that it is crashing their computers.The graphics are okay, but I would have been extremely ticked off if I had paid more for THIS. Thank heavens I have GRID to putz around with. I will not be getting DIRT 2. I have no idea how this got such good ratings.All-in-all, this is still a console game. Forget it.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,"Fun, but with performance issues :-(","This game is extremely fun (great sense of speed!), but unfortunately, the game has performance issues, even on a ""monster"" system like mine: eVGA 780i, Q6600 @3.6 GHz, 2x Nvidia 8800 Ultra's, 2GB Kingston Hyper-X RAM @ 800 MHz clk 3-3-3-10-2T, Creative Soundblaster X-Fi XtremeGamer, Win XP Pro, etc. The frame-rate is extremely jumpy, and at times will just pause for a few micro-seconds when more than one car is on-screen, no matter what resolution/graphics settings--such a shame, as this heavily detracts from otherwise awesome presentation. Get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead."
1,Was expecting alot more from Codemasters.,"This game is so choppy even on low settings it is not really playable. Worst game ever in my opinion. I bought GRiD which was awesome so I assumed the same quality here. I was sadly mistaken. I played it maybe 5 times and decided to uninstall. Just not worth it. Save your money and by Flatout - Ultimate Carnage, better graphics, smooth gameplay and really fun."
2,Good game...but...,"Good game, great graphics. It does run a little choppy on my Core 2 6800/NVIDIA 7950 GT system, but with a 8600 GTS card runs very nice at 1280x720.The problem I have with the game is it installs StarForce verification drivers on your PC. These drivers are incompatible with a PC with Blu-Ray playback (PowerDVD). The drivers basically disable Blu-Ray playback on your system. I wrote CodeMasters about it. And guess what? They didn't seem to care (surprise, surprise).I like the graphics and game. But I can't forgive a company that installs software on your system which disables other software from working properly."
4,Great Book,"First let me say I love reading. Sifi books are not really my cup of tea but since I know Patrick from chatting with him, I figured I would give his book a try. Let me tell you he is a wonderful author. Not only will you get involved with the book once you start reading it you will find it hard to put down. He is a great writer and I wish him much success with his work. I a def fitly looking foward to future books by him."
4,Absolutely Fantastic!,"It's been a long while since I've enjoyed a fantasy book as much as I did Orphan's Quest. The story is full of mystery, suspense, and lots of heart. The characters are believable, and you bond with them rather quickly. The overall story arc in the book is well-written, fantastically detailed, and set at a very comfortable pace.The relationship between Rokey and Flaskamper is one of the highlights of the book, and a part that I enjoyed thoroughly. The pacing of their relationship is a bit too quick in the beginning, for sure (i.e., they jump into it faster than would be realistic), but besides that one point, it's very believable and genuine, and both characters wear their hearts on their sleeves.I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys epic fantasy novels, set in a detailed world, and with top-notch characters."
5,Life In Your Way - Waking Giants,"Life in Your Way's newest album, and their first since signing with Solid State, is their cleanest yet. Life in Your Way has always had deep lyrics with complex and energetic music and this album is no different. However this album seems to be more mature, there is less raw energy and more beautiful melodies surrounding lyrics that come straight from the heart. Since the first time I saw LIYW play my favorite thing has been the way they blend screaming hardcore with purposeful lyrics and soaring bridges, and they have taken it to a new level with this release. Though I like most of the new songs, Track 6, ""Salty Grave"" is my new favorite LIYW song. Also, the Waking Giants cover art (a mountain range made out of a sleeping man under a starry sky) is amazing."
5,love it!,"Always been a fan. Great album, great songs all around. ""let it be a sweet sweet sound..."" oh yes! it is definitely a sweet sweet sound!"
4,Good... but not great.,"I was a huge fan of ""Ignite and Rebuild."" The music on that album was amazing. ""The Sun Rises..."" was also very good, but didn't do it for me like the the later album. Now, when I heard Life in Your Way had switched to ""Solid State Records,"" I was so excited. It serves them right. They are a great band with a lot of talent and deserve better exposure, which Solid State could provide them with. But, The record label has taken certain things away from their sound that I most enjoyed. The dynamics. The older stuff held the music (guitars) at a higher regard, than ""Waking Giants."" The music is generally the same... the vocals are still great, but the mixing and editing has washed the guiars together. They aren't as distinguishable as they previously were. Therefor, I find that the music isn't as powerful as it once was. But, this is still worth buying!"
3,"Well produced, great photos, but few surprises","I agree with the reviewer below whose expectations were raised by the excellent ""John Fitzgerald Kennedy: A Life In Pictures,"" then somewhat disappointed by this book. It's well done but really doesn't evoke the era or the excitement of its subject beyond the level of a Biography Channel documentary. The photos are great but not especially arresting or telling. You actually get more of a feeling for JBK and the period from the book on her husband, which I strongly recommend. It should be noted that the JFK book was produced by Phaidon and this by another company, despite the title and dustjacket design similarities."
4,Old Arcade Style Shooting Game,"A fun shooting game with all sorts of hidden bonuses, extra time, multipliers and the lot. Targets appear and dissapear and you just aim and shoot with the mouse. There are good guys and bad guys. Shoot the good guys and your score suffers. You can also win different guns that will allow a faster firing rate, and subsequently a higher score."
3,Good for about one afternoon,"This shooting game was fun for about one afternoon. After that it just became repetitive. The graphics are very simple and two dimensional, almost cartoon like, but it was entertaining for a while."
5,"""I was worried, I heard you'd been shot today.""","I purchased this DVD only a few days ago, and upon it's arrival had watched the entire contents therein by the next morning. Having heard a few things about this during it's pre-production stage I had high hopes for the latest Key Pixel picture, and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.UCF: Toronto Cybercide takes what we know about our world today and then skips forward in time to one-up our expectations of the future. The film is yet another example of how this group of artists, writers, hobbyists, and friends can churn out quality projects again and again. Keep an eye on this gathering of filmmakers - it may not be long until they make their way to a silver screen near you!"
1,Don't buy it if you're looking for a quiet clock,"I bought this clock because it's described by Seiko as having a ""Quiet Sweep"" second hand. Well, it's as loud as an average analog clock, maybe a little worse. I even sent it in for a warranty replacement, and the second one was as bad as the first."
4,The Original Classic!!!,"The original is darker and a little more serious than the 2005 remake. Burt Reynolds stars as Paul Crewe, a former football player who gets arrested after stealing his girlfriend's car. Paul is sent to prison, and asked by Warden Hazen to put together a football team, and have the convicts play against the guards. I highly recommend THE LONGEST YARD!!!"
4,ONE OF THE BEST SPORTS MOVIES EVER,"Much, much better than the later Adam Sandler version, the movie was so good it gave Burt enough leash to go out and make stinker after stinker for about a decade.The LONGEST YARD is easily one of the best sports movies ever, from my point of view only surpassed by BREAKING AWAY. By now it looks quiet dated (look at the cool remote control!) and I'm still wondering how they were able to convict Crewe on drunk driving when he dumped the car in the water and was arrested in a bar (where is alcohol level would understandably be high). Anyway, when the final half hour arrives you can't help but cheer, no many how many times you've seen it."
2,Boring and dated,"I've been wanting to watch this film for over 20 years, but sadly, like most other films of the era - The Longest Yard was flat for me. Some films don't age well and this was no exception. Everything seems hackneyed rather than real. Sure, I wasn't expecting ""Any Given Sunday"" but something a bit more compelling. I couldn't finish this, but maybe BR fans will have better luck.."
4,Great Classic Movie,"It's Football and Burt Reynolds what more is there to say !! Very enjoyable, I like it a lot more than the new remake"
1,"Where's ""Saturday Night Special?""","First off, I love the original film ""The Longest Yard."" However, as some of you have already pointed out, this ""Special Home Video Version"" has been tampered with to the point of ruining the film for long-time fans. As already pointed out, the closing song ""You Gotta Be a Football Hero"" had been changed to ""When The Saints Go Marching In,"" and a scene with Crewe and the Warden has been deleted. That's bad news! What I don't think anyone has mentioned is that the song ""Saturday Night Special"" was playing in the original film when Paul Crewe has the car chase with the police, then dumps his car into the bay. This song was cut out of the lousy, worthless ""Home Video Version."" Sorry I can't be more positive. But this film should either be restored or discontinued to save people from throwing away their money.Dear Paramount....please restore this film!"
4,An American original,"This is the movie that started a spawn of similar type movies (none even worth mentioning), where they start from scratch, put together a raunchy group of characters with no hope, and train them to be a winning football team. Although a little dated, this is still a fun movie to watch. All-around ""macho"" movie. One of Reynold's best."
3,The Longest Yard was a '70's classic prison genre movie.,"i didn't read the book however it's a great movie with gritty performances by Burt Reynolds, Eddie Albert, and Robert Tessier. The football game between the guards and the inmates is hilarious. Besides Deliverance, this is Burt Reynold's finest acting moment. A great video to rent from time to time. END"
1,Can't get it to read a disc!,"I cannot give this CD player a good review at this point. I bought it for my son for Christmas. It worked for only half a day and then it would not read the disc. It said ""no disc."" I returned it and got another. This one said ""no disc"" from the get go. I have to send this one back too. The look is great and my son loved it when it worked!"
3,Syndicated or broadcast?,"Does anyone know if the episode ""Resolutions"" is the syndicated version or the original broadcast version of the episode? Any help is appreciated."
3,shorter versions,"I don't think anyone mentioned it (or noticed it) but Don't Eat The Snow In Hawaii is a shorter version of the same episodes from Season One. The Best of Magnum cut out the part when the sister of the dead naval officer arrives at Honolulu airport drunk. I believe they have cut out a few minutes of each episode. Beware. As a true Magnum fan I need everything, however, as an alternative I do like the compilation and think it's a good idea. Just wish they include the full versions though."
1,what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i own the entire series and wonder why people would want to buy selected episodes of a series. seasons 2 to 4 were released on flippers and we all know the problems with those discs. i also wonder how this could be the best of when ""all for one,"" a two parter from the fifth season is not included. in that two parter magnum and his buddies go back to Nam in search of pow's."
3,Syndicated version of finale,"I bought this because one of the Magnum websites said that this had the original broadcast version of the final episode. It doesn't. It's exactly like the one on the Season 8 set. Same ending credits, same cut scenes, same syndicated, 2 part version. The good part is that it only cost $3."
3,decent game if your a shooter fan,"I thought this game was sort of fun. Yes, its a shooter only with ter'angeals instead of guns. The story is nice, but I only wish that they would have made it more of an RPG. My guess is somebody will probably end up doing one anyways based on the popularity of the books. Just hope its a good developer like Square Enix."
4,Impressive.,It is a good game.. it is by no means great or genre bending but a good game all the same. Single player is enjoyable.. and detail levels are absolutely magnificient.(I especially liked the whitecloak fortress'and the city of shadar logoth is truly terrifying). In addition to this multiplayer is alot of fun. Using different spell combinations to incapacitate foes is perhaps the greatest star this game has to its name.
1,Very Very Dissappointing :o(,"I have been reading through the books and when I found out that a game was to be released I was very excited. When I got the game however I was extremely dissappointed to find out that, with all the complexity of Jordan's world, the best they could come up with was a 1st person shooter. The books are so intricate and complex, and yet with this game there is no character interaction, nothing to figure out. On top of all this, the music was terrible. Instead of authentic stringed and woodwind instruments they get some bad rock band who throw in a fiddle every once in a while. I had to turn it off. As far as 1st person shooters go it was great, but when I think about the series and all they could have done, this was a terrible dissappointment."
5,Amazing Multiplayer Game,"This is a truely amazing first person shooter -- especially, but not solely, for Jordan fans. The various combinations of offensive and defensive weaponry (ter'angreals) allow for a mind-splitting variety of strategies and tactics in the Arena (deathmatch) and Citadel (capture the flag) play modes. (And I am generally NOT a fan of first person shooters). The graphics are also exceptional, if you have a powerful graphics card and a lot of RAM. I have barely scratched the surface of the single player game despite owning the title for over three months -- the multiplayer is just so good that I never get around to the singleplayer! There is also a very active online fan community -- with an array of clans you can try out for (see www.wotgame.com), which makes an enjoyable experience that much better. Stop dawdling -- click that button and buy this game!"
4,Inventive and creative Multiplayer.,"I'll keep this short, since I played it such a long time ago. This gamewas so underrated, it's a shame it didn't do all that well. The multiplayerwas creative and interesting - spell casting ... and counter spells! It turnedboring ""shoot-em melee"" (ala Quake2/3) into a tactical shooter. Plusadditional setup time for multiplayer and the setting of traps andbarriers was unique, and added enhanced play value.And the Unreal engine was used to its potential. Gorgeous maps andlighting. Almost as awe inspiring as the original Unreal maps when theycame out (and they were - don't be jaded by today's standard's (4/21/2003))(Sunspire, anyone?)I think the only reason I stopped playing this game was that I went froma school T3 connection to a 56k modem ... and then got caught up laterby other games."
3,ho hum,"The game was fairly tiresome most of the time. I suppose there were a few gripping moments, but the storyline was rather poor. The Magic system was good, and there were some cool moments like being able to levitate your enemies over your head and throw them off the tower wall. But there were problems with the AI and the monster men looked stupid. The game featured a group of witches that really should have been Holy Sisters, by the way they acted. What's with today's world? God forbid anyone have a chaste Nun as a heroine. No, instead we must have witch-sisters. The artwork wasnt bad, I'll give that to the game-makers. But this game overall doesnt come close to the excellent work done on something like Arx Fatalis. Better to save your money and get that instead."
3,Get gyped?,"This game is really fun,but it would be a five star if you could play as Rand in single player mode."
1,I have a few choice words about this game,"I think I got this as a Christmas or birthday present, anyway while they were giving directions, the game bugged and it was telling me to do a standing blast of magic or something, and my character started moving forward and it wouldn't stop. It sounds like my problem was unique, but even without this bug, I wasn't too impressed by this game. First of all, it would be better off following the book's plot, but from what I remember it was mostly campaigns (I didn't get very far, as I tried to return the gift only to have the people at Walmart say, ""we're sorry but we don't return PC games""). I also don't remember having normal attacks, it was all ranged stuff, and combat system was a bit crummy. First-person mode is totally inapropriate for a story game, third person [like FFVII] would have been far more fitting."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this because I was, and still am, a fan of the Wheel of Time series. What I didn't know, though, was that this has utterly nothing to do with the WoT extended universe, flat-out ignoring and contradicting things posted in the books. The Seals' locations, the way that ter'angreal work, Mordeth's premature escape from Aridhol, the Black Sisters' uprising, and the ending itself were all on my 'don't like' list."
5,Ideology in Literature,"Paul Simpson's ""Language, Ideology and Point of View"", although originally written in 1993, is still an invaluable resource book for those interested in investiganting literature from a linguistic perspective. From the outset, Simpson affirms that ""in the context of narrative fiction, point of view refers generally to the psychological perspective through which a story is told"". This is undoubtedly the 'foundation stone' of an interdisciplinary basis for the study of narrative in the context of literature, critical linguistics and a more functional view of language. Simpson's work, thus, reflects the need of a linguistic view of the subject literary studies have been looking for."
3,Not enough by itself,I found the book to be informative and helpful. This is my first microsoft exam. I just don't feel that this book by itself was enough to prepare me. I'm finding the Exam Cram book much more useful.
1,Poor...,"I was excited to get this product, but it has proved to be very poor.. It does heat up slow like it says but as far as I could tell it never heated up with the gel side.It slipped around and was exceedingly heavy and clumbsy. I Don't recommend it."
5,Great as usual,I love Joanne Harris's writing. She almost sounds like a poet at times and describes things so well. This book was hard to put down because there was always something happening and everything ties together so well. It's eerie and mystical.
2,Didn't like it at all,"All that one can say about this book is that it's ""Gothic"". Yeah, right. Here are ghosts, witches, mad wives in the attic, black cats and other mandatory attributes. But probably, ""gothic"" decorations are not enough for a book, there should be something else. Something that I failed to find. The novel is tedious and empty. A weak attempt to create a thriller rather failed, the plot is hardly glued together, the episodes that are probably supposed to scare remind a bad horror movie that is full of dark rooms, ominous music and crazy screams, but simply does not frighten, period.I finished the book, but it was a waste of time. If you want a good thriller by Joanne Harris, read her ""Gentlemen and players"" instead."
5,Excellent for anyone trying to lose weight!!,"I lost over 30 pounds through the timely, sensible, and realistic advice from this book! I love the Minirth-Meijer workbooks and this one is highly recommended!"
3,Not for everyone,"Read the workbook and found that although I'm sure that it is useful for others you really have to be of a christian faith to use this workbook. It does have many ideas and suggestions in terms of weight controll but I felt it emphasized to much on ""God"" and ""problems with your family of orgin"" and not enough on making us realized that we are in controll and we are responsible for our weight not anyone else. I would although recommend it to someone whose had a horrible childhood."
5,Thomas Bangalter brings the dark funk of Daft Punk's 1st LP,"If you've seen the film, you know how brilliantly intense this score is. Thomas Bangaler (1/2 of Daft Punk) returns to the dark n' dirty sounds of Daft Punk's amazing first album on his score for Irreversible. Everything from really killer noise/score tracks, to bangin punky house tunes. This CD is a winner, and a welcome departure from the pop sounds of Daft Punk's last album. Go straight to tracks 8&10."
5,Please read!!!,"I moved to Ada the same year that this crime took place. The ""mood"" of the city at that time was unbelievable. Somebody had to go to jail for this crime and I believe the police knew these two men were innocent. Convicted of murder for a dream ...even though every aspect of your dream was proved false by the police. More people need to read this book!!"
5,Small town incompetence abounds!,This book is as good or better than Grisham's 'The Innocent Man.' The best thing that could come of it would be if someone looked into all the details found by the Private Investigator hired for the defense. He unearthed many things that point to suspects other than the 2 young men who were convicted in the court of public opinion long before the prejudicial trial ever took place. My sympathies to all involved.
4,the dream of ada,the dreams of ada is a very good book and it is a true story from a small town just an hours drive from my home town. I have relatives living in ada and we all followed the story as it was happening.
5,Shocking!,I am very thankful that I don't live in Oklahoma. What a fiasco this is. Anyone with half a brain can see that these two guys are not guilty.
3,Dreams of Ada,I bought this book after reading The Innocent Man by John Grisham. I personally could not get into this book like I did the other one. But other reviews tell me it is an excellent book.
2,Reviewing Dreams of Ada,"This story is scarry seeing that it is true. It is unnerving to know that crimes are handled so poorly and that innocent people can go to prison and guility ones free. It was poorly written, however, and difficult to read. The punctuation was worse than of a 3rd grader. I do not see how it ever got published."
4,tops my list of true-crime novels-but it left me hanging...,"Never before have I experienced that ""can't put it down"" scenario with a book! This definately tops my list. The only query I have is that it is an older book/story (events-'84, book release-'87) and I was left uncertain of the fates of Tommy and Karl. Now I don't know where to turn for answers!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"ABSOLUTELY RIVETING TRUE CRIME ACCOUNT OF TWO YOUTHS CONVICTED AND SENT TO DEATH ROW FOR DUBIOUS CONFESSIONS TO THE MURDER OF A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK..........THE EVENTS HERE TOOK PLACE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE 1987 BOOK IS BADLY IN NEED OF AN UPDATE/AFTERWORD........OTHER THAN THAT,THE BOOK IS FASCINATING AND ALWAYS LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS THAN THERE CAN BE ANSWERS TO......"
3,Problem playing on different DVD Players?,Problems playing on different DVD Players?When inserting in a Blue-Ray player you have to switch forthe different Chapters...it seems it won't play a blue-ray.
4,"Quite a good, moving historical film","An excellent companion to the 2006 second part ""Karol: The Pope, the man"". Excellent acting.One of our favorites. God Bless Blessed John Paul II!"
4,Top 5 movies of all time,"Will make anyone's Top 5 movies of all time ... inspirational, spiritual and philosophical. A must see for any Catholic lay person. Also priests, religious or anyone anyone thinking of entering an order should watch this !"
5,Great Movie!,"I purchased both ""Karol, A Man Who Became Pope and ""Karol, The Pope, The Man."" Both are awesome movies. It kept my attention from beginning to end. If you like Pope John Paul you will not regret purchasing these DVD's!"
1,Does not fit all toilet seats,The spacing of the bumper push in posts did not fit my kohler toilet seat. This demension should be stated in the product information.
2,Waste of money,"In short, there is nothing in this book either straight women or gay guys don't know. I expected a fun and engaging take on the subject, instead it was a boring restatement of things I would expect any adult to know."
5,Perfect!,"I am a single gal in Chicago, and sadly, I have no gay male friends these days.This book was recommended to me by Amazon when I was searching for flirting how-to books.This may be sold as a sex tip book, but it has everything a woman needs!The advice is no-nonsense, easy to digest and retain, and helpful on every level. The flirting tips work, I swear! The physical pleasuring tips work well, from what my partners have said, and I have observed. I have even followed some of the tips on bedroom design and I am really pleased with the result.This is advice any man could tell you, but straight men will be quiet about it, and gay men won't tell you unless you know to ask. So I recommend this book to every woman looking to find, hook, and keep a man, or men.Indispensable!"
4,A must read - even for the experts!,"This book is a great read! I think it is written in a really easy and funny way, and one actually relates with the authors - gay and straight! I have bought this book and given it to 4 friends for a Xmas gift - they all think it is the greatest!"
3,"Good tips, but nothing revelational","I had high hopes for this book. And while I have found much of the content to be accurate and enjoyable, there is nothing that truly sets it apart from other guides. It was primarily a review course."
1,A great concept is wasted by the authors of this book,"I was very dissapointed in this book. I made the assumption that a book like this would be targeted towards women who like sex and want to be better at it. This book treats sex as though it is a chore that women must perform if they ever hope to acquire jewelry. It assumes that the reader doesn't enjoy doing certain sexual things with her man. In my experience, women like that wouldn't buy a book like this anyway. Also, one of the reasons that a woman would ask a gay man sex advice, is to learn more about the pleasures of anal play for a man. This book all but says that your man is probably gay if he enjoys anal stimulation. This is absolutely a false assumption. I found in this book, that neither of the authors, the straight woman or the gay man, had any sex tips of value for pleasing a straight a man other than the very basics found in any sex book."
4,FABULOUS,Lets just say whats happening now two weeks after i got the book...Im moving in per his request :)
2,Spelling errors and typos!,"This was a quick and easy read. If you are a beginner this book would be very helpful. But if you are looking for more advanced techniques, I wouldn't recommend it. While initially quite humorous, it doesn't take long to feel as if the authors were trying too hard and the writing style soon became annoying. The biggest distraction I had with the book (Kindle version) -- numerous spelling errors and typos. This could've been a transcription problem.....whatever the reason - it was just awful!"
1,ok,"its an ok book, the tips are common sense, it was a fast and easy read.. not worth buying. i was expecting more techniques"
2,Cute books but tips useless!,"This book was really well done with regards to its artwork and writing style. It's got a really cute/kitschy retro style, both in writing and artwork. But are you buying the book for its artwork or for its TIPS, supposedly coming from those who should surely know?Well, I bought this book for some good tips, and without getting too specific in a public forum, let's just say that I do not recommend any of the advice given!! Two of the techniques in particular were completely contrary to what any of my partners have since said they like. Now maybe something was lost in the translation, but in a manual of this sort, you would hope the tips would be so clearly explained as to be goof proof, and in my experience that was not the case.This book was a great idea in theory, but for me it wasn't particularly helpful. Use at your own risk!"
2,It was just alright.....,"Frankly, I was disappointed by this book. Although it had one or two good tips, it certainly was not the arsenal of cool sex tips that it's made out to be. I've gotten more information from some other books I've read (The Ultimate Guide to Performing Fellatio). Decent for a beach read, but don't expect rockets."
2,I was disappointed,"I expected something really funny, refreshing, and informative, but there was only one thing in the book that I found new, and the rest were things that most people know already, and it just wasn't very funny. If you're curious, get it from the library, unless you're too embarrassed...in that case, go to one of your gay friends directly."
3,Okay Book,"I bought this book for a friend, the product got shipped fast and came in PERFECT CONDITIONS JUST LIKE NEW! Only thing is she told me that when she read the book, the book it self was not to great it states things that are very basic. Anyways I think it was a good product, great price, and fast shipping! :D"
5,Hmm...,"Saw this book mentioned in the movie ""Hope Springs"". Thought it would be an interesting read, and indeed it is. Always learn something new...lol"
2,"Good tips, but glaring misconceptions ruin it","This book had some tips that sounded pretty good (and that I'll probably use in the future), but this book had two big problems that caused me to stop reading the book, despite the former good tips that I had enjoyed. Those two things are the authors.Maggie comes across in the book as the most vanilla woman ever. There's nothing really wrong with that, but it doesn't really work on a sex advice book. She and the other women in the book don't seem open to anything that's really kinky, and thus I felt there wasn't anything she could tell me that I didn't already know.Then there's Dan, who proved that just because you're in the minority doesn't mean you're enlightened. ... ......Also, some of his tips seemed impossible to carry out. (""The Flying Wandella"")All in all, I think I'll go to a straight man the next time I want to learn how to please one. These guys aren't worth it."
4,Rock over Japan,"Thee Michelle Gun Elephant sound like Urge Overkill on mescaline - this is the band most likely to run over Godzilla's toes with a '66 Cadillac and bash his head in with guitars. Deduct one star for the sound quality on the live track, which sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine."
1,JUST A TOY,Mine broke in a few days. Not a robust vacuum cleaner. More of a toy than a permanent household item.
2,"Good concept, poor execution","While this machine has the capability to be an innovative and hands-free vacuum, there are some major problems that need to be addressed. First of all, be warned that before you use this machine, you have to make your house ""Roomba-friendly:"" you have to hide or move any cords or spare odds and ends from the floor or else the machine will get stuck. Also, emptying the compartments of dust or dirt entails becoming very comfortable with dirt. Because the Roomba doesn't use bags, you have to manually clean the three dust compartments out yourself, which can be sort of a pain and you get dirt all over the place in the process. The rotating brush underneath the vac also tends to get clogged with dirt, hair, and fur. The vacuum itself, while working properly, is a great machine; however, I was surprised and increasingly annoyed by the maintenance it requires."
1,Sent it back after a week....,"Unfortunately, the Roomba did not work as well as I hoped. I have three children, no pets so thought this would be great. No. It got stuck and couldn't get out of some corners. Did not get edges very well, and the little edge guide kept getting tangled up with any hair or thread it might have picked up. It was okay in the kitchen, too high to go along the base board under the cupboard, but would pick-up some of the crumbs. It does not always get all the area you aim for. It worked great if I ran the vacuum before I used it. I think it would be great for a disabled person or perhaps a nursing home or hospital. I sure wished this would have worked!"
3,oh joy help around & around,"I just love that I can be cleaning bathrooms while I'm vaccuuming too! My boys love their chores now.""Mom, I'm going to vaccuum-be right back!""My house is big & I have 2 boys & 1 dog. It needs a vaccuum everyday-ugh! This way I do a room with my oreck while""she"" does another.I love it- not for everyone,I'm sure,but we love it."
3,When it works it's great,"Got mine for Christmas and was very pleased with the performance although the amount of time spent on cleaning brushes and filters after each use was, in my opinion, excessive. It is now less than three months later and my unit has died. I have contacted the company and hope for a new replacement. For the money, I would be happy if it lasted a year, but 3 months??I will say however, that when it works, its great. Wonderful for pet owners and those with wood or non-carpeted floors. It will handle short and medium pile carpeting, but cant handle deep pile. It adjusts nicely between floor and carpeting on its own. Except for the short lifespan, I really do love it and hope the company fixes the problem."
3,Great but unreliable. Needs better than 90 day warrentee,"My 85 year old mom loves hers. However, the first one broke. The wheel on one side lost a belt, and she returned it. The second one lost a tread on a wheel and needed a repair kit, which irobot promptly sent. She has not experienced the short battery life problems, but I don't think she's been able to use it enough to find that an issue. She also has bare floors -- no carpets. It works very well on bare floors.I wish it were a better product. Given the reliability issues, the 90 day service warrentee is totally inadaquate."
2,So long Roomba - you were great while you lasted - 6 months,"I was in love with this little miracle for the first 6 months. Now it no longer pickups up. Just rides over the dirt and particles.I am trying to find out where to get it repaired, but the tech support people just keep giving me different ways to clean it. Nothing is working and I am beginning to wonder if there are no provisions in place for busted machines.Very expensive to have to buy a new one every 6 months!I hope they come through. This could be a great product!!!"
2,Engineered to need periodic factory repair?,"The Roomba is a great floor sweep and outstanding robotics. However. when caught on tassels of rugs, builds up stress in the gear box that drives the brush and cracks the gear box cover. This plastic cover is unncessarily precut at three places full-length across the plate and each connected only by one flimsy plastic edge. One cut in particular crosses a screw-hole so that overtightening of the screw at the factory assures that the plate will crack with use. The company does not sell this piece of plastic and insists on factory repair. There is no apparent reason for the gear box cover to be precut except to get the Roomba back to factory periodically if they want it to."
3,Still Need My Corded Vac.,"Roomba does passable cleaning job, when one prepares the area first by removing small objects and lamp cords. Keep in mind any rug fringe will jam the motorized brush and stop the roomba cold. The battery was worn out after only several months use. In my opinion, this item should have been priced lower, and improved before release. I replaced the $50+ battery and $50+ charger, to save unit. See if you can try one before you buy. The roomba performs reliably now, but my cats still don't like it."
1,Not shipped within 24 hours as posted,"The shipping delay is misrepresented. Don't expect your product to be shipped within 24 hours, it's been 5 days already, and it is still not shipped."
2,Battery a problem,"The unit worked great when I first got it. However, the battery no longer holds a charge for more than a very small room. I have only had the unit for six months."
1,I would'nt buy it,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. Charging the batterytook 12 hours. After I took the charger off, the battery drained without my using the Roomba. I received an adapter from the company to prevent the battery draining. I bought the extra battery and its charger. Sometimes the extra battery holds a charge and sometimes it doesn't. You have to partially disassemble the device to clean it. I don't think it cleans particularly well either."
1,Great idea -- bad quality,"I LOVE this thing -- EXCEPT it broke after 4 months -- yes, right after the warrantee expired. And not some small problem. You charge it for 24 hours, then it runs for 5 minutes and shuts down because the battery is low.I'm going to try the new one -- but ONLY because it has a year warrantee."
4,delighted,"The roomba is great! After I got all the chords out of the way,I used clear duct tape for the ones I couldnt raise and blocks of wood under the legs of my couch,the roomba goes places I have never been.We have a chihuahua and the amount of dog hair this gadget picks up is amazing.Dont watch it, I do one room at a time and do something else productive, its like having a helper.All my friends cant wait to see a demo.I had my doubts but Iam very happy with her."
1,"Potentially great, but not yet","I bought a Roomba vacuum for my wife (and me) for Christmas. After two chargings and a total working running time of about 20 minutes, I've repacked it and returned it to the store. Twelve hours charging time for a 10 minute running life just isn't worth $200. We only intended the sweeper to be a backup to our Rainbow sweeper, but what we got was just not worth the the hassle and frustration. Yes, maybe the problem was just a bad battery, but again, for $200, I want something that works right off the bat. The potential is really there, we both liked what it could do, but this first generation model just doesn't live up to what we expected."
1,worked for a while...,"This fun product was intended to be a ploy to get my youngsters to pick up their belongings before the fun of watching Roomba vacuum the floor. It was an effective strategy for a time. Then Roomba began to misbehave. All the help that Customer Service offered was, ""Sounds like the mother board's fried. I can offer to sell you a reconditioned unit."" No, thanks. That little fun was too expensive, so I shall go back to my Luddite ways."
1,A Big Mistake,"I love gimmicks, but this one stung me. Everything you have read about the battery dying and a new one not helping you should take to heart.While the company is a reputable one, this product is not a good one."
1,More of a novelty item,"Got the Roomba for Christmas thinking it would be really neat to have. We don't have carpet, so I thought it would do a great job. It did the first couple of times. However, it stopped picking up all the pet hair no matter how often I did the suggested ""maintenance"" on the vacuum. I find that to be a pain as well, having to unscrew things and try not to lose the tiny screw, etc. etc. It's kind of a gross process anyway. Also, I have now found there's a reason it only comes with a 90 day warranty. Got it in November, and it broke tonight. The rubber tread around one of the little wheels ripped and came off. What a strange piece to break. I don't see a replacement part for that on the iRobot web site, so my husband is trying to glue it back together. I might as well just throw it away. I wish I had asked for something different for Christmas! =("
3,Call Amazon for an exchange,"The Roomba is pretty nifty in helping clean a room. The problems experienced by the one person is not normal. If you are having battery problems, call Amazon and ask for an exchange. They are usually helpful with returns and exchanges. The Roomba Pro is a better deal but this will get the job done if you have an apartment."
4,Just like a toddler,"The Roomba is just like a toddler - it roams the room unsteadily and then cries when it gets into trouble and must be rescued. It really is cute.But enough simile. It does its job - great at threads and tiny scraps (I sew) and hairs and dust. Easy to empty the dirt compartment. It works fine on our new living room carpet but not our old sculptured one downstairs. It stops repeatedly on the sculptured (not shag but apparently not even enough to allow Roomba to operate) and must be turned on again and again. At that point, I get out the regular vacuum.But on a flat carpet and vinyl it works just like it's supposed to - it seems to cover the area if left on long enough. Amazon sent the little guy to us promptly."
5,Simply the best gadget on the market,"I was impressed enough with the concept to order and give it a try. My husband was the major skeptic. Well.... he was wrong. We have not touched the regular vacuum in over two months since we have owned this wonderful addition to our family. It easily moves from the hardwood to ceramic to carpet. It cleans more thoroughly than I had ever imagined. I have had NO problems with it whatsoever. With over 3,000 sq. ft. of floors, this little roomba has it's job ready and waiting. Even the family sheltie is used to it and doesn't seem to mind being in the room while it's working. Worth every penny and them some....."
4,Love The Roomba,"I just LOVE my Roomba! I've had the Roomba for a little more than a week, and I've been using it every day. It works great on my berber carpet and laminate floor. It did have some problems with my 20-year-old carpet (should anyone have carpet that old?), but when I used it the second time it actually did a better job. If you have time to push two buttons, then you could be vacuuming your floors EVERY day (something I've never done before). The floors look great, the dogs are over their fear, the kids can spill cereal without mom yelling, and dad doesn't have to wipe his feet! Why didn't I give the Roomba five stars? The small dust bin and the long charge time. But please don't let that scare you, if you're thinking about this product, BUY IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
4,Compliments,"I purchased the Roomba just prior to back surgery due to severe arthritis. A traditional upright vacuum was difficult to use without pain. I actually didn't expect much from the Roomba, but I was mistaken! I have read the other reviews on this page, and I have to disagree with any comments that the Roomba does not replace traditional vacuuming or that it does not pick up as well or better than an upright.I am surrounded by pine trees and the Roomba even picks up the needles I track into the house. The dust bin and trap MUST be emptied each use--which takes all of about 30 seconds. I run the Roomba daily when I leave for work. It does half of my home one day and the other half the next. I have never had so many compliments from visitors who are surprised at the cleanliness of a bachelor's home! The only reason I can't give this product a rating of a 5 is that it does take some planning to vacuum because of the 12 hour charge time."
1,dont buy it,"This product is horrible. It only worked for 2 months, and they sent me a new battery pack which didnt help. They should have replaced it a long time ago. Now it sits in my closet collecting dust, and so does my loor. I cannot vaccuum because I am disabled, I can never get through on the phone, and when I do they put me on hold and disconnect me. Your roomba doesnt work. and for all the money I paid, you would think your product would work. Still on hold.Holding in NJBonnie Monaghan"
1,Customer Service Nightmare,11/05/06 I requested info on software upgrade because Roomba was not working correctly.11/07/06 Received email from Jeramy requesting mailing info and Roomba info.11/07/06 I sent info requested by Jeramy.11/16/06 I requested status.11/17/06 Received email from Heather U. saying that IRobot was sending me a code stick. It was to be sent first class mail and I should have received it in 7-10 days.11/25/06 I requested ticket be kept open until I received the package.11/28/06 Received email from Heather A saying that package should be released for shipment in 2-3 business days.12/03/06 I requested ticket be kept open until i received package12/09/06 Adam(Customer Support Supervisor) emailed that package should ship in 24-48 hours.12/13/06 Nothing has shipped.
3,"ROOMBA, IMPROVEMENT NEEDED","I OWN TWO OF THESE AND THEY FILL IN WHEN YOU HAVENT GOT TIME TO VACUUM. THEY DO NOT ELIMINATE THE REGULAR VACUUM. THE CAPACITY IS TOO SMALL, AND THEY DONT HAVE THE POWER. TO SUM UP: GOOD IN A PINCH, AND WHEN TIME IS SHORT.....WORTH THE MONEY....."
5,Great machine,I just got this machine and am really happy with it. I have 3 dogs and 4 cats and lots of dust bunnies and milk bone crumbs.With this machine you can have it vacumn your bedroom while you get ready for work. While I walked the dogs last night it vacumn my living room and dining room.I have laminate flooring and it works real well on it. It also did a good job on the area rug in dining room.I mopped my bedroom floor last night and ran the vacumn again this morning and was amazed how much dust it picked up from a floor that was cleaned last night.The vacumn is not one you could use when your in a hurry but with this vacumn so easy to use you could keep your floors pretty clean all the time.
2,didn't meet expectations,"1) suction not strong enough2) one must monitor it because it can sometimes get stuck or keep going in the same pattern.3) its a tad too loud4) gets stuck on the ""frilly"" ends of a persian rug5) doesn't come close to effectiveness of a normal vacuum cleaner"
3,"GREAT vaccuum, AWFUL customer service","Roombas are brilliant, but iRobot's customer service is astoundingly bad in my experience. They took 2 months to ship most of my order, which was not listed as out of stock (but secretly was), then shipped it to the wrong address, incomplete. Once all these issues were solved, they shipped the last parts, again to the wrong address. Phone service that followed this was downright rude. If I were buying one again (and I might), I'd buy through a 3rd party, not directly from iRobot."
2,Does not save time. Does not pick up all dirt.,"It is much easier and faster to use an old fashioned vacuum than the Roomba. I have had my Roomba since May 2003 and have not been happy with its performance. It does not work well on medium pile carpets and I would't even try it on deep pile. It works best in an empty space which means I have to remove chairs and other stuff from the room before I begin. On medium pile carpet, it stops and gets ""confused"" by making aborted attempts to go in different directions. It does not pick up all dirt even after going over it several times. Since it stops so often, I have to be in the room with it to turn it back on over and over. It works best on tile and linoleum. The battery no longer keeps its charge and I have had to call customer service for a new one."
5,Lil' Buddy,"When I received this as a Xmas gift, I thought ""Oh great, one of those Sharper Image type gimmicks that are neat to have, but no one ever uses"". Boy was I wrong. I find myself using this thing constantly for general surface cleaning on floors, carpet, tile, etc.It makes cute little R2D2 sounds when in distress, battery runs low, or dirt canister is full. You can basically let it run amuck while you run errands, watch tv, whatever. Most importantly, IT WORKS!The $... price tag is reasonable considering what the unit does ....Overall, highly recommended, especially for open floor plans."
5,It works as promised.,"It works ! Perhaps it is not very intelligent (it uses an overkill approach to clean the floors) - it means that it runs and runs, and runs until everyhting is clean. But in the end it gets it job done, and well done.There's a rug that i hate to clean because it captures every dog hair available in the world. It breaks my back to clean it once a week. Well, the little robot cleaned it in 15 minutes, after going over it again and again and again. I just had to remove the dust bin and empty it after the works was done.It might need a little manteinance every once in a while because it collects A LOT of dust.Don't leave any mobile small objects in the floor: the robot will try to climb them and get stuck. Don't leave sandpaper or steel wires on the floor, also ! (well, i was painting, all right ?) Luckyly enough, nothing bad happened.This vacuum is well worth its US$ 200. It saves you a lot of time."
2,3 defectives,"The Roomba (old model) works fine on my tile floor (whole house is tiled). I would have to say that it took 3 shipments to get one that would work. Apparently, there are a lot of used models out there being reshipped to customers and the batteries are getting old and not holding or charging. I would suggest that you go with the newer model so you will not have to go through my situation. It is amazing to see how much it does pic up through a midweek vacumn. But nothing beats doing a manual job in my opinion. Especially the edging by moldings and chair legs."
1,Back to the drawing board,"I saw this and had to have it, When it arrived I fell in love with it's performance, However after about (8) useages it just died. $200.00 bucks is not that much but the company should take it off the market until it they can make it a little more durable. I think if Ibotics does some more R&D I will get another one.(but not till I am sure it will last at least 2 weeks.)"
4,"Wonderful, but it does have one flaw...",I love my Roomba! It's a great idea and it works wonderfully! The only flaw I've found is that the battery loses its power quicker the older it gets. I've only had my Roomba for about one year and the battery doesn't hold a charge long enough any more to complete one large room. I plan to purchase a newer version of Roomba in hopes that they've fixed the problem with the battery. It's perfect for those who have back problems & cannot push a heavy vaccuum around.
4,coolest thing I ever bought!,"First off - this thing is amazing. I can watch it for hours and I have to show it off to all my friends. For being the first widely used robotic vacuum, it gets 4 stars. Being the first leaves it with some problems which I'm sure will get fixed in later versions. Here they are:- It doesn't get corners....no big deal.- It misses spots once in a while and/or isn't powerfull enough to get something that's slightly stuck to floor that a normal vacuum would....no big deal.- It doesn't work well on regular wall to wall carpeting....big deal to me since only the kitchen and bathroom are uncarpeted.So if you have hardwood/tile floors - this thing is great! Turn it on right before you leave for work in the morning! As it says everywhere, this is not a substitute for a real vacuuming - so just remember that.Again, it's the coolest thing I ever bought!"
2,More hassle than just vacuuming the old way,"I've had the Roomba for about 6 months and have basically stopped using it. Why?- Its rollers & brushes get tangled with hair every 5 runs or so. After that, I have to sit down with it and cut the hair off with scissors (10 minutes). And I don't have any pets, either.- It's too loud to use when we're in the same room or even the same floor.- It's always getting stuck on something / under something / around something, so I generally have to rescue it once or twice per cleaning session.- Finally -- it's not -that- hard to vacuum a room on your own. Just getting the Roomba out, making sure it's charged, putting it in the room, then removing it and re-charging after the cleaning isn't a lot easier than getting out the vacuum and doing it myself."
5,I love this thing!,I've been having shoulder problems and my heavy vacuum was becomeing a problem. I looked at lighter with vacuums and came acroos the roomba. I read all the reviews and found most of them to be good. so I took the plunge.It does not get directly into the corners but neither did I unless doing a heavy vacuum. It picks up great and is very easy to use. It gets under the bed and other funiture. It gets inot tight places and finds it's way out. I just did a samm bedroom and it only took a few minutes. I did use the virtual wall to divide up my living room/dining room. It was working fine not using the wall but I think it waisted battery power by going over the same places too many times. The virtual wall fixesd that.I highly recommend this item!!I recommend this hightly.
2,Overpriced Gadget,"This is a cleverly designed and well built product. However, it is more a ""carpet sweeper"" than a bona-fide vacuum cleaner, and the tiny motor and vacuum device it has will only remove surface debris - something you could do with a stick-vac or even a broom in a few minutes. If you are willing to pay $200 for a robot-like gadget that has limited utility, then you will like the Roomba. If you want to clean your floors thoroughly, then buy a conventrional upright vac, most of which cost a lot less than this trendy gadget."
3,Roombavac,"I waited over two months to write a review of this product.First, it does exactly what it claims it will do.However, the reason I give it only 3 stars is that I have had trouble getting the battery to charge. I plug it in, leave it until the green light goes out after 12 hours, but whether it really charged or not is a gamble.I did go to their website and print out suggestions for this problem, and it seems to have helped it charge about 50% of the time. I haven't a clue as to why, when I do the plugin the very same way each time, leave it until the green indicator goes out, 12 hours later, that sometimes it charges, sometimes it does not.If this problem ever gets solved, I would rate it 4-1/2 stars.I also would like the inventors to soon come out with a larger one, with a stronger battery and better suction. It can be taller than 4 inches.F. Munsonfranmun@wmconnect.com"
2,It Shuts Itself Off,"While this product does a good job with the clean up, every time I run it in my foyer, the side located power button shuts it off when it runs into the spring loaded door stopper. Never fails happens every time in this room - sometimes 3 restarts are necessary to complete the job. I think this design flaw was corrected in later models."
4,Better than expected!,"As many, I was concerned this may be more of a toy than a tool, but was suprised to see how effective it was. It's great in bed rooms, taking care of under the bed and the like. It works nearly as well as our full sized vacuum, except in tight courners and stairs. The only down side is that it really must be empied out at every use; once you're used to the process, it's quick to do. I would not hesitate to buy it again; we might consider the newer version, espically for the 'spot clean' function."
2,Still a Toy - Not Made to Last,"My Roomba failed in just over a week. The brushes stopped turning, despite FREQUENT cleanings (which requires a screwdriver and some manual dexterity). I opened up the case to investigate and found that the brush motor uses PLASTIC gears and bushings, and one of these had actually MELTED. Don't take my word for it though: Do a web search and you'll find more detailed descriptions and pictures too.I called their customer service department, and they initially conceded that this is a problem. In the end, though, they claimed I had voided the warranty by investigating this myself.So be careful... your Roomba will require frequent emptying and servicing in the best case. And in the worst case it will fail altogether in a very short time."
5,Cleaning for the bachelor,Not wanting to get a cleaner in and hating doing it myself I picked up this little beasty a few months ago. With the addition of a second invisble wall it now merrily cleans my whole place. In fact there are probably parts of my place that haven't been cleaned in years as it fits under couches and the like. Now if they would just bring out one to mop the kitchen floor......
5,No Sneezing,I love this thing. It really works so fare. I can get the vaccuming done without sneezing my head off.Great Product.
1,review of Robot vacumn,This product just does not work..you have to watch it every single second and worst of all it picks up little. A five year old child using a broom would do considerably better than this machine. I was very disapointed in it.
5,"It's So Good I Call It ""Rambo""","I find Roomba to be just what I needed. I can even watch TV while it cleans, it so so quiet. I have some tile floors & some Berber carpet. It does a fantastic job on all of it. It is very important though to empty the dust receptacle & clean the filter after each room. But that is sooooo easy. I find it amazing to see it go in and out under the beds & sofa where I can seldom clean with my sweeper. Just use it often. Don't let the floors get too dirty before using it."
1,A wish that didn't come true.,"During an info-mercial I was sold on Roomba as I watched it pick up piles of dirt, hard candies, and even little tacks. After seeing the price on T.V. I went to the Amazon site and found a ""great deal"".Five weeks later my ""great deal"" was in the garbage because it was easier than dealing with the companies customer service. It never worked like they showed. On carpet it picked up surface dust only, on wood it only pushed the dirt around with the little revolving broom (which broke after the first 2 weeks), and despite the companies claims it does get stuck in corners alot. (And I'm not rearranging my furniture for Roombas convenience.) When you empty the dirt collecter be prepared for bacteria and skin molecules to go up your nose.I gave it one star for keeping my dog entertained."
1,"Good concept, poor execution","When roomba works it is great, but based on my experience and many comments available on the internet it is trouble-plagued. Roomba has a three month warranty with parts being replaced up to six months. For troubles during the warranty period, they replace parts, including roomba itself, readily although you still have to pay shipping charges, about $20, if they replace the unit. However, after the warranty period, if something goes wrong you have had it. ROOMBA CANNOT BE REPAIRED. Unfortunately, things frequently do go wrong.I think that most of the good ratings of roomba, even by publications, are made after initial use before the troubles show up. I am amazed that the company has done nothing to improve quality or, at least, made the unit repairable. After about nine months I now own an unrepairable, i.e. worthless, roomba."
2,Size matters,"You get what you pay for. The price was great but at just 11"" wide this splatter guard is not large enough to cover most frying pans."
3,"It plugs in, lights up, and seems to work just fine","It is not easy to get really excited about a phone charger cord. This is made of plastic and feels like it but it seems like it will last the lifetime of the phone and the car so what's the difference?Only one complaint noted: The size of the plug is large and I did need to really force it into the socket. Maybe that's just a german car thing and it fits fine in other vehicles but I have no such problems with other plug in gizmo cords.Once seated (firmly) it works fine. I just worry every time I pull it from the socket as I need to twist and tug the thing and that can't be good. As for the cool blue light, it's better than no light at all but again, not worthy of high levels of excitement."
4,A new perspective on an old way of life!,"First reading this book for an anthropolgy course, I had no idea how fascinating it was going to be. The book is a detailed description of the life of himalayan herders, specifically focusing on the village of Melemchi in Nepal. It describes the agrobusiness that subsidies the main activity of milk and milk by product production. Also, the intricate lives of these people and their interdependence betwen them and their environment is maginificent. All in all, awesome information with simple but detailed text. This is a great book for those who are interested in learning about different world cultures, and the author makes it easy to identify with people who live a much simpler, but just as work filled, as ours. Great book and very interesting!"
5,Big fans of the sonics!,"CHeck this out if you are into sixties rauch. There are even certain bands from the 60's that sound exactly like the mummies! (if you don't believe me check out CHANTS R&B's punked out cover of ""land of a thousand dances"" everything from the voice to the sound quality and raunch is there) This band is true to its garage roots unlike the new mainstream supposed garage acts. You'll dig. And if you don't listen to 60's garage its about time you start!"
3,Give Me More!,"A quick and easy read about one of our true sports phenomonons. This book leaves us wanting more, infact when I finished my reaction was that now, I wanted to read a book about Michael Jordan."
4,muwhahahaaaahaa (just started readin),"I just started reading the book, spenbt about 20 minutes on it, im on page like 60 something . But its aight, gives facts and true stories about his life. Pretty tight, you find out soem interesting stuff, like he NEVER has had a job his entire life."
4,"Ok,but""""",I have always been a fan of the show and always watch it when its on even though i have seen almost all the episodes several times.I did notice some of the episodes that looked pretty bad.The transfers were horrible on at least 2 episodes and that kind of ruins it for me.I like them to be equal in quality.I cant give the set to bad a ratng because of a few bad transfers so i have to say it was ok.I hope the next set is better.
3,Why Can't They Get It Right?,"I was really thrilled to open the 2nd season of Green Acres. Very funny episodes, but to my surprise the transfer quality on some of the shows was unbelievably bad! When it's done right, the picture should look pristine. Instead you could easily detect flaws in the film as though they had held a camera up to a tv to make the copy from a videotape.Also, some of the laugh tracks were really muffled which became distracting while trying to enjoy the episode. Why can't the company get it right? This isn't a dvd collection you find in the bargain section. We're paying hard earned money for these dvds and certainly deserve our moneys worth!"
4,just what we wanted,"We loved green acres the first time around and love it just as much now.The dvd were excellent quality and played well. Price was reasonable, also."
5,The Episode LIST,"1. Wings Over Hooterville2. Water, Water Everywhere3. I didn't Raise my Pig to be a Soldier4. How to See South America by Bus5. The Ugly Duckling6.

5,Classic TV,I love this show and each and every unique character in it especially Mr Kimbal. Classic TV at it's best. comedy is very clever throughout. I personaly prefer this season more than the first. all good!Picture quality is great. cover of case nicely presented although similar on the inside would of been a nice over all presentation. Stronger plastic cases would be better for shipping as cut-away cases can allow possible damage to disc during shipping.
4,Green Acres - Second Season,"Green Acres is always good for a laugh - a bit silly at times, but still heads above any modern comedy. Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor were great in their roles as Oliver and Lisa Douglass. And don't forget Arnold the Pig. Relaxing and funny, I'm glad I made this purchase."
3,Brings Back My Youth,If you like silly comedy this is for you. Yeah it is a bit ridiculous at times but it still has its appeal. Green Acres is worth watching for nostalgic reasons or just for the silliness.
2,"Good price,that's it. And Ralph gets a makeover ,Va Va Voom!","I love Green Acres but other then the price point not much to cheer about here. Yes it's nice having the episodes on DVD but beyond that were do i start? The transfers are really poor..lots of grain and scratches. The packaging has been downgraded since the season one set came out, now it's just a very basic dvd case without any fold out or art. Not that the first one was all that eighter but it was much nicer than this. No commentary whatsoever which is drag considering quite a few of the principals are still around. No extras at all. All in all it's worth having because it's so cheap but it's kind of crummy because it's so cheap."
4,Extremely fast opening knife,"This knife uses the lever to fling the blade open. The lockback mechanism is the same as on all of the other lockback knives. Requrires two hands, one to push the spring and one to close the blade.Advantages, about as fast opening one handed as it gets. No springs to break. Street Legal.Disadvantages, carrying it in your pocket will eventually gum up the works. WD-40 will clean it out and then it will work fast again. No thumb cut in the blade so that you have an alternative method of opening the blade. The lever sticks out just a bit, making a lump in your pocket and will eventually wear a hole in your pocket. (Takes about a year, same as if you carried keys in your pockets.)All in all, a nice carrying pocket knife."
4,Good CD program in the Hawaiian language,"These CD's are just what they say: instant immersion. Written materials would help the very beginner; since I already know some Hawaiian, they aren't really necessary but would be nice. I enjoyed writing the vocab out and that helped to reinforce the teaching.I concur with one of the other reviewers: the gentleman who speaks Hawaiian on the CD has a genuine ""old style"" accent (my kumu was a native speaker as well) while the woman speaker seems to have been trained in ""university Hawaiian,"" which can be a bit jarring to the ear. But, it is good to have a male and female voice speaking the words and people do have different accents by island, age and training. So it's not all bad but if you want to know how native Hawaiian speakers use the language, the male narrator is wonderful. His English is beautiful, too!I definitely recommend this. Novices should also buy plenty of Hawaiian-language music to help develop an ""ear,"" too."
4,Hawaiian Immersion CDs,"This set of CDs is professionally developed and suitable for people who are committed to learning the language. It presents a broad range of vocabulary and the structure of the spoken Hawaiian and the translations is clear and easy to follow. What this course lacks is a written translation of what is in the CDs. People who have different learning styles therefore miss out on this extra support. Also missing are basic conversational structures that would allow the listeners to understand spoken Hawaiian ""in the street"" and begin to converse themselves."
3,Intense,"I actually like this CD series but it is VERY intense and I don't like that each CD has nothing to do with the prior CD and they are not related or review or even apply what you previously learned. Additionally after the 1st CD each one goes into a story, in Hawaiian, which I don't understand and they never translate."
3,excellent but accent different,this is excellent in content but the accent of male speaker is a bit distracting and i am hawaiian from hawaii. i would prefer a native hawaiian accent.
4,interesting combination cook book and history,"Giacosa gives us the original latin text of several ""recipes"" from the ancient world, translates them into simple English and then gives us a list of ingredients we have available in our modern world from which to make these dishes. Very simple and not very exciting, it is of far more interest to the food historian or ancient historian than to any cook. I, for one, am glad I don't have to live on most of these dishes."
1,Not up to the quality of the original,"I only listened to the sample songs, so I don't want to be unfair to the musicians, however, the interpretations did not (by a long shot) capture the lush complexity nor musicianship of Jill's original music and her band. I recommend you purchase the Real Thing - Jill Scott CD's and DVD's!"
4,Flyball Beginners Must,"Great book. Really informative. I love the way it is broken down and info is VERY easy to understand. I was already familiar with flyball and got it for ""training tips."" I recommend this to anyone who new or interested in flyball."
1,Terrible!!!!,"This CD is the most amateurish terrible one I've heard in years. The songs are ""synthesized"" with the most annoying, simplistic drum machine. The sax is often off-key and misses notes. Although it is listed as ""various artists"" the liner notes says that it is all done by a Mark Arneson, who ""produced, arranged, mixed"" and actually ""played"" all the ""instruments"" (keyboard??) himself. And it sounds it, like a lone wolf attempted a tribute to Mr. Morrison which actually is an insult. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD since samples of each song were truly bad. If I could give this minus stars I would. I am so sorry, Van Morrison is one of my favorite artists......"
4,"No surprises, but who cares?","Nothing substantially new here, but so what? If you are like me, and just couldn't get enough of Unreal's unique feel, this is just the ticket. The levels are as pretty as ever, and how can you beat the ambiance of that soundtrack? If you're looking for the ""latest and greatest,"" you may be disappointed. But, if you just want another dose of what made the original game so phenomenal, order up a copy."
3,Uh..,"""Awake"" and their first release are by far MUCH better. The tracks on this CD sound identical, mix and guitar riff wise, as their other songs. Plus, we've all heard ""I Stand Alone"" a million times now. So that's one less 'new' track on this CD. If you're a Godsmack fan, buy it, but if you just want to listen to new music, I'd recommend ""Meteora"" by Linkin Park, or wait for the new Staind CD due out 5/20/2003, ""14 Shades of Gray""."
4,There still rolling,"Alot of people that wrote a review to this thought godsmack still sounds the same.Aceally this album is simuler to there self-titaled,and Awake.I think Sully sings alot more then on the past two albums.I think the sollo's are a little better.I like all of there album's eather way thou.If your a godsmack fan I recomand that you add this to your collection!"
2,A New album? Yeah Right!,"Buy one Godsmack album. All the Godsmack you need is in your hands now. Get the point?Every song, every note, every word, every theme, pretty much everything is the same. They aren't a bad band, but this album isn't any more creative then Awake or the Self-Titled one. I just went to see Godsmack in concert, and I could have left after one song and still gotten the concert's heat. So overall, if you like Godsmack, don't expect anything new with this album."
3,review,"there are a couple of good songs on this album but there not as driving as the other 2 albums...especially AWAKE,probably there best. The writing for this album seems to have slandered for this one. But hopefully they will have some fresh new ideads and THE SAME DAMN DRUMMER for the next album."
1,Evolve or Die,"When it comes to music, I am a darwin-ist. The problem here is the mountingly stagnant lyrical content, derivative of practically everyother metal band previous, and I wasn't too happy with their lyrics either. If you want a band that is post-grunge nonsence, go with Seether. At least they sing with the passion the original had.Oh, and props to the guy who recommended In God We Trust Inc., Cheers!"
1,Im So Glad I bought this ...,"Im so glad I bought this....Ive alwasy wanted 11 versions of ""I Stand Alone"".What a dissapointment.......I do Like serenity though."
1,Craptacular,Worst thing i've ever heard. Pure garbage. Can you say generic? It really deserves negative stars but it won't let me do it. I'll give it a negative 4 billion stars.
1,Not that heavy!,"I'm going to make this short. My dad likes them and he let me listen to some of it, but I don't really see why he likes them so much. I don't think they're that good."
1,Pointless,"This is commercialized radio-ready slop that will warm the hearts of posers and nu-metal fans to no end. This is indescribably atrocious material that's embarrassing in its simplicity and execution. The ""riffs"" are stale and mercilessly simple and uninteresting (and horribly repetitive), whilst the singer is giggle inducing with his pathetic style. This wretched offering will hopefully merge into obscurity given enough time. Will appeal to fans of commercial rock radio and those who want to check out 'some heavy stuff' without feeling intimidated by what's out there. Contemptible ditties for the poser lot."
5,FACELESS: The album other bands tried to be,Godsmack's newest album FACELESS takes them back to their roots. They have that hard sound complete with killer riffs and beatiful drumming by newest member Shannon Larkin formly of Amen.Sully Erna leads the group with a more developed voice that cuts through metal. The band is destined to be the next Metallica (Of course im talking about the pre-selling out years). This is by far the best cd to come out in a long time. The guitar solos are well timed and cut perfectly with the flow of each song. There is even an acoustic guitar present on this album. This shows that Godsmack isn't afraid of experimenting. Badass cd from a badass band. Go get it now. It's the album for which all of rock standards will be put against.
4,Great Gift,"The person I bought this for really LOVES it. I like some of the music but I don't enjoy it as an album. Don't like to have to switch tracks. It did, however, make the perfect gift."
2,"""Faceless""... pointless","I bought the new Godsmack CD ""Faceless"" the day it came out and have yet to listen to it all the way through. Why should I? Halfway through it I realized that I already own a better version of it. You might too. It's called ""Awake"" and it was Godsmack's last CD before this one. There's not a thing on here that I remember an hour after listening to it. When Godsmack first came out, I loved their bare bones approach because ""back to basics"" hard rock was in the minority at that time. Now it just seems like they're not even trying anymore. To me it sounds like Godsmack are just riding their notoriety to the top of the charts and can't be bothered with writing catchy songs anymore. Well being friends with the guys in Pantera will only get you so far, and after that you're on your own. Here's to the most appropriately titled CD of the year... ""Faceless""."
4,This is what you expect from Godsmack,"Godsmack has a proven formula and they do not deviate from that on Faceless. If you're a fan of their self titled debut and of Awake, then you should enjoy Faceless just the same. Tony Rombola's riffs are ever present throughout every track, providing that signature Godsmack sound. New drummer Shannon Larkin is just as awesome as their previous drummer and bashes those skins very skillfully. I recommend this CD big time!"
5,He!! yeah,"I just went out and bought this cd.i was suprised to find that its only like 8 bucks.ive been listening to it all day,and i love it.i dont like it as much as the first two,but i really dont know it all that well yet.I am glad to see that they havent mixed rap in,or and ... music.if you like hard music,you will like this cd.later"
4,Typical Godsmack,"It lacks in originality, but what do you want? It is nearly impossible for ANY band to make up bona fide new material in ths day and age.It does kick A$$ though. Heavy riffs, growling and screaming lyrics, and the creation of a powerful atmosphere by this album. I found it best to listen through the entire album, not skipping a song.If you just want to take the stress out on something, do it listening to this."
3,same old thing,"Godsmack has never really been that great. Just a really heavy sounding band. This album doesnt disappoint if you want heavy. ALthough, if your looking for complicated songs and great vocals this isnt the best choice. The lyrics arent really that deep. At least he doesnt talk about being alone as much that got pretty old. IF you want heavy get the album but thats all it is."
4,get smacked,"OK I have read reviews from other magazines and It makes me a little uneasy to see low reviews for this new edition to the godsmack phenomenon. Yea I am little biased,but my god with all the sappy pop, and whiney(my life in the hood)RAP,I just find it refreshing to hear some actual instruments being played on 10, accompanied by sully's patented screams and grunts.Godsmack opens on a heavy note with ""straight out of line"" and continues to kick your teeth in for the next five songs,of course they throw in the much played ""I stand alone"", but even after hearing it 100 times it just keeps getting better.Yea of course there are a couple of fillers towards the end, and ending on a soft note with serenity.But for the most part it's a great album."
5,Definitely Godsmack!!,"Godsmack fans, get this album yesterday. It's been too long since we last got a taste of them!! We had a little teaser last year when the Scorpion King was released, with I Stand Alone. This now-familiar song can be found on Faceless! For those who find Voodoo to be their favorite tune from past albums, check out The Awakening with Serenity. This album definitely has an edgier sound, but not so much so that you think, ""Who the He** are these guys?"" Nope, definitely Godsmack."
5,New Heavy Metal Thunder From the Boys of Boston,"Godsmack's new album faceless is a brilliant addition to their already vicious catalog. The first single, ""Straight out of Line"" is a killer song aimed at friends of the band who just dont get it. This could very possibly be the finest effort yet by the boys from Boston. With songs like ""Make Me Believe"", ""Release the Demons"", and ""I am"", Godsmack shoves a fistful of metal right down your throat as only they can. The final track, ""Serenity"", lays down a solid groove in fasion with other Godsmack greats like ""Vodoo"" and ""Spiral"". Basically this is a great new album, and definetly something that any metal head can be proud to hang their head to. So I suggest going out and picking this one up today"
5,Smacked 'em again!,"Just when you think they couldn't be any tighter, they gain even more power with their new drummer. With this album they bring back the ""power ballad"" style of intensity.Healing is what I feel from this new release! Hence the cuts, Awakening, Re-align, Make Me Believe, Straight Out of Line, etc., where the first two albums were screaming out the pain of righteous anger this one brings it full circle as if to say to the offending folks ""you'll not keep my soul!"" The epitome of ""what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger."""
1,Faceless,"I am a rabid Godsmack fan. I roared out to buy this CD, even when some of the music magazines gave it a poor review. I want my money back. This CD left me asking why I was paying 16 dollars, after tax, to listen to a persons whine sessions with their psychiatrist. The one good gitar solo gets cut off and left to hemorages on the recording floor. Where are the driving drums I came to love? Save you money, save your time, buy the earlier CD's."
2,INCREDIBLE RIP OFF!!!!!,"ok, that's enough...when you think Godsmack will mature their sound and become something almost original, they did it again....like other reviews said, FACELESS!??!? what about FACELIFT, from ALICE IN CHAINS where even the front cover is incredibly similar, with a distorted face....man, even godsmack's logo is a clone of ALICE IN CHAIN's logo with a sun!!!!! and the singer tries really really hard to sound like Layne!!!!! all the stuff together is embarassing, because this is not a AIC cover band....the songs are really heavy and i like some like I STAND ALONE, but all the songs are very similar and the whole album is a long ride...if you never listened to ALICE IN CHAINS, you may actually like godsmack, but the incredible rip off goes on...."
3,Heavier stuff but no hits yet!,"I took a chance in buying the CD since none of their new songs are really that popular in this part of the world. I've been listening to Godsmack ever since I heard their headbanging song 'Whatever' a couple of years ago. I must say that this album is definitely an improvement in terms of their music. Sully's voice is much angrier and the riffs are heavier. But I guess I'm still looking for that hit that one song that will elevate this album. But overall, it's still a good album!"
5,What a sweet cd....,"This cd is amazing and such a great addition to anyones cd collection. Godsmack really came out of thier shell with this cd. the songs range from hard bass drum rythem to bongos and congas this cd is really a great piece of art, if you dont own it yet GET IT i promise you that you will enjoy :D i know i did"
5,Godsmack Are Amazing,Everyone of their songs on their cd's are amazing i dotn knwo what it is about it but it makes you keep on listening i've had their cds for years and i still listen to them over and over again. Sully Erna has an amazing powerful voice and is good at anythign he sings cuz i've heard some covers of other songs that Godsmack does and they are awesome. they had their new cd faceless come out on 4/8/03 and sold many many copies i can see why.
4,very good Godsmack record.,"unlike ""Awake"" what you hear on the singles on this album is what you get: heavy nu metal rock songs. I stand Alone and Straight out of Line have being in the radio for a while, mostly everyone might have heard them by now. Well, that heavy guitar sound combined with that bombing bass and amazing drumming (this new drummer is awesome!) is what you are gonna get musically. Sully's vocals sound a lot better and more melodic, without leaving it's anger and strength, than in the previous two records. It's catchy, sounds heavy, it's great.Highlights: I Stand Alone, Faceless"
3,Nothing Spectacular,"Purely generic rock. This is nothing spectacular and really wanes over time, the first couple times you listen to it you'll be knocked on your ass, but a year later it will have taken up permanent residence in the bowels of your cd case. These guys are too busy mimmicking their influences to be anything really revolutionary, the only thing creative is Serenity, easily the best song on the album. The whole cd has one repetitive theme that gets old after track 3. They right slower songs far better than harder ones, the new acoustic album(can these guys rip Alice in Chains off any more?) should be pretty good, but Faceless is really boring."
4,What happens after you finish laughing...,"My reaction probably wasn't typical, but by the time the CD got to ""I f**k*ng hate you"" I couldn't help but burst out laughing.The profanity is so over the top that it's a cartoon. It is Billy Idol's scowl. It is the backbeat of Queen. It's effing funny and worth the price as a parody if nothing else.But when the laughter fades, the listener is amazed at the talent that shows in the music. They harmonize in several vocals. Harmonies done in the same manner as the Lennon Sisters, if they had a drumbeat and electric guitar riffs. It's good stuff. Don't dismiss it lightly."
1,Thanks for nothing!,This CD is not that good. It is basically a rip off from the bands previous CD's. There is nothing new the CD just has nothing special about it. Awake was a great CD but this CD shows that Godsmack might not have any more good ideas. If you want a second copy of Awake buy Awake again instead of buying this CD.
4,Pure Heavy Metal,"Godsmack is one of the only newer bands to be considered ""heavy metal"". All other bands newer bands are rapcore, pop metal or f*cking nu-metal. Godsmack has got it all. This album is great. I only gave it a 4 star rating because it does sound a little similar to the others. The song ""Serenity"" is totally new and cool. It has a dark beat and freaky lyrics that just make you wonder. Typical Godsmack. Anyway, if you like real freakin' metal like Metallica, Ozzy, or Pantera; you will love this. IT TOTALLY f*cking kicks a**. It is well worth your damn money."
1,GIVE UP!,"this is one of the most crappy repetitive cds ive ever heard in all my life...its even worse than their last one or the one before that (at least their debut had a few ok songs on it) + the vocalist is really bad, he sounds like hes constipated or somethin... if you want some really good repetitive crap, buy some britney spears or that hilary duff person!!!...YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF NOT TO BUY THIS CD!! YOU DESERVE NOT TO HEAR THIS CRAP!!"
2,more of the same.....,"for 15.00 bucks, dont bother. if you have the previous two, good enough. the other two cd's had a track or two that ""grabbed"" you...this one, same riffs...same sully voice,etc etc. they've resorted to(aka limp biskit) using the F word as the tittle of a song. i am a fan of this so-called genre of music and i know the faithfull will be mad that i wrote this, but let the buyer beware. sadly,it's another long awaited cd by a band i really liked that is at par or less w/their previous efforts."
1,Unimaginative corporate rock,"To all of you who rate Godsmack more than 1 star....I feel sorry for you because you don't realize you are being ripped off bigtime. This is a band who took there name from a song by grunge band ""Alice in Chains"". Fine. But it doesn't stop there. They are not inspired by Chains...they are trying to be Chains. The only problem is that there are no interesting guitar riffs, the singing blows, the music is boring and unimaginative and it is stunningly lame. There used to be a time when a guitar player would inspire other beginnners to learn or to play. Seriously, do you feel the guitasrist for Godsmack could inspire anyone to play? It is a sacrilege. Do yourself a favor and go listen to ""Dirt"" and then tell me, in all honestly, who has the more intersting melodies and riffs...Jerry Cantrell of ALice in Chains or the wannabe from Godsmack. Abort this band immediately."
1,This band was great when they were Alice In Chains!,"I honestly used to like Godsmack but as i got older my music taste matured and I found out how great ""Grunge"" is (the best kind of rock music) I ventured upon Alice In Chains cd ""Dirt"" I was blown away by how good this cd is. Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called ""God Smack"". It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called ""Sap"" and the other one called ""Jar Of Flies"". Dont buy this cd buy AIC cd ""Dirt"" or ""Facelift"" They are way better than any Godsmack record. Don't support a band with no original sound or talent!"
1,Nothing to write home about..........,"This album is nothing special. To be honest, almost EVERY song sounds the same, the singer does not sing with emotion, every note is the same. FLAT. I have listened to IV prior to this, i liked IV, so i figured id listen to godsmacks earlier releases .....after listening to this crap, i dont EVER wanna hear GODSMACK evere again~"
2,Overplayed garbage.,"Straight out of line I can't find a reason to give this album any more then 2 stars. That song is on the radio every 15 seconds and it grows boring, then annoying within no time at all. And that's just their single. I can't imagine what the rest of the album must sound like. Ick."
1,Worthless,"I hate Godsmack with a fiery passion that consumes my soul. Does anyone else notice this is the exact same CD as Awake? Or that Awake was the exact same CD as Godsmack? (cleverly not spaced, to avoid legal trouble). Give it up. Youll never be Alice In Chains. Go buy Dirt or Facelift."
4,Godsmetallica,"Is it just me, or does this sound like Metallica did about ten years ago. Heck, I like the album. It does rock. And maybe the criticism others have about it sounding like their earlier work is right, but I don't own their first two albums and I like this.Track seven, though, I don't copy to my mp3 player. Really stupid track."
2,they sound the same,"i dont like godsmack because all thier songs sound the same except serenity. they have no diversity. i like music that is diverse, like korn the difference between songs by korn is great godsmack isnt, so if youre like me, dont get godsmack"
3,Great Godsmack!,"In my opinion Faceless is Godsmack's best album yet! From the title track and all throughout, you know you are in for a good musical ride! If you like great metal music, you must have Faceless."
3,"Very good, but songs are all a bit same-ish","Like many other bands Godsmack had a big hit with ""I Stand Alone"" and made many songs of Faceless sound very much alike. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because all the songs are listenable. Great drumming and some awesome guitar solos, not much bass. But I would definatly recomend this cd to anyone."
3,i dont know if i would call it a masterpiece but....,there is some great quality music on here dont get me wrong. but it seems like they have lost everything. sully has been dissing other bands and has lost the respect of his fans. But the music is great. Love I STAND ALONE. And Serenity are the best songs. both of them sound completely different. but they are about the best songs that godsmack has ever song. they arnt as heavy as some think too. jk they are very heavy.
1,Faceless and worthless,"The king of all constipated-sounding vocalists, Sully, comes back and fronts his band, Godsmack, for another corporate piece of trash. Godsmack keeps performing the same song album after album. Even when they attempt to ""stray"" away from their weak heaviness, they STILL play the same song as ""Serenity"" sounds EXACTLY like ""Voodoo."" Voodoo Boodoo, whatever. So fans, please tell me what the difference of every song is. Oh nevermind, you're all too tonedeaf to know. My best advice for someone who happens to go through the trauma of listening to this, is to just simply shove your fists in your ears. For the true fans of theirs, read these following words carefully....THEY ARE DONE AFTER THEIR NEXT ALBUM...now kiss me :o"
4,A great cd,"This cd rocks!1. Straight Out of Line: One of the best songs on the album. The military intro's kinda cool. 5/52. Faceless: Second best on the cd. 5/53. Changes: OK... 3/54. Make Me Believe: This song is good, but not the best 4/55. I Stand Alone: It's not amazing.. 3/56. Re-Align: I LOVE THIS. The version on The Other Side is better, though. 5/57. I F****** Hate You: I like it, I think this song is stupid though cuz it gave it the explicit warning... good song tho 4/58. Releasing the Demons: Weird but good 5/59. Dead and Broken: It's alright 3.5/510. I Am: cool.... 4/511. The Awakining: The best song ever!!!!!! LOL j/k. Really stupid song. Just to say the cd has 12 songs on it prolly, it's just an Indian tribal dance song.... 1/512. Serenity: I love this song. The best on the cd, the best Godsmack song. good job!! 5/5Overall, I love this cd 4/5"
4,'Good'Smack,"I can't understand why some people say that Godsmack had change a lot in this album. I think they're still doing the same, in fact, some songs in this album are very similar to some of the most aclaimed songs of Godsmack ('Re-Align' beginning is REALLY similar to 'Awake', for example).If you like Godsmack you'll not be dissapointed with this album, because it's plenty of good songs. I can't see those changes that some people are tellin' here. The same deep sound, awesome riffs, powerful vocals from Sully and all those things that make Godsmack a different band. And the new drummer is good too.My favourite songs are 'Changes', 'I stand alone', 'Re-Align' (check out the great guitar solo in this song), 'I ..... hate you', 'Releasing the demons' and 'Dead and broken'."
5,I absolutely love this CD,Every song on this CD kicks butt. Great for listening to at work IF you are wearing headphones. (Don't play it within hearing range of children)
1,What the hell is everyone else thinking!,"I dont know what album everyone else is listening to. I have been a huge godsmack fan ever since they came out, and this is by far their worst album. IT [IS WEAK]! There are only two songs that are worth listening to, and the rest seem like they arent even trying. Their new drummer seems to have thrown the chemistry of the band off. I had waited for this album for two years, and was disappointed beyond words. Save your money for their next album, and forget this [one]."
1,Awful,This album [is bad]. It sounds exactly like their previous efforts. They did not change their formula or anything. Not one memorable riff or chorus or verse except for the song they did for The Mummy soundtrack and the final acoustic ballad piece which is the only strong song on the album in my opinion. I can't believe people like this boring drivle that Godsmack passes off as good music. Utter disappointemnt.
4,.... Review of Faceless,"Godsmack latest release ""Faceless"" debuted at number 1 this week and for good reason. Godsmack usually know for its heavy but rhythm friendly sound has maintained a reputation from its last 2 CD's and does not disappoint with ""Faceless"". The album shows growth and change in the sound, but nothing too drastic. A sacrifice of some rhythm for a heavier edge is a minor change that is noticeable but not unwelcome. The album's second track ""Faceless"" is definitely one of the albums high points with the adrenaline taken up a notch, and even a guitar solo...we like it. The fifth track is somewhat familiar being that it was released several months ago, yes ""I stand Alone"" is also on the CD and is pretty typical of the album, it seems to fit right in. Faceless even has a ballad of sorts, ""Serenity"", with its relaxed pace and somewhat positive lyrics it is a nice way to wind down the album.<..."
3,Same old Godsmack,"It was hard to distinguish Godsmack songs with two album, now it's even harder with a third album that sounds exactly like the first two. That's not necessarily a bad thing, Godsmack has a pretty powerful sound. It's just that Faceless doesn't have any songs that will pass the test of time. The first album had Voodoo (which I will never get tired of) and the second album had Awake (best Godsmack song in my opinion). Sure, Faceless has Straight out of Line and I Stand Alone, but they don't really stand out among the rest.So what does this album do if it doesn't take Godsmack to a new level ? Well, it does the job. This is Godsmack like they were before and they don't disappoint from that point of view. If you liked the first two albums, you'll like this one. If you like the new single, Straight out of Line, there's no reason why you shouldn't like Faceless. If you didn't care for this band before, you won't start now. That's about all there is to it."
2,Same Stuff...,"Every song on this album sounds just like songs off of their first two albums. If you want good Godsmack, buy their first two albums. This is sub-par metal...Godsmack is still Faceless..."
2,"It's All The Same, Nothing New","Godsmack was good for 2 albums. S/T was a start of a new wave of real metal. AWAKE was Fresh And More To The Point. This One Is The Same SH*T As The The Other Two. The Sound Is No Different, The Vocals On This One Have Really Lost Their UMPH! And The Sound Is The Same As ""Awake"". Its All The Same, Nothing New. I Thought These Guys Would Be Different From Other Sell Outs Like Metallica And COC. BUT THEY HAVE OFFICIALLY GONE TO HELL!!!"
2,They have released the same album three times in a role!,"I do like the band and the new drummer is excellent, but Sully needs to let the others get more involved in the song writing because their songs are starting to sound the same and become boring. Aside from that, the main problem is their guiterist, Tony can't play a solo if his life depended on it and until they replace him they will continue to suffer for it."
2,zzzzzzzzzzz,"i was hoping to get a new, fresh, insanely catchy sound from godsmack with their latest release, faceless. boy was i let down. i have only listened to this cd one time, and i have no desire to hear it again. one of the songs (needless to say i forgot which one because they all sound equally as boring) almost sounds exactly like the transition part of ""awake"" from their previous release. i love every song on their last cd and i was expecting something equally as good as that, but they didn't deliver. don't get me wrong, they still have some pretty catchy parts on this cd, but mostly during their instrumental transitions. it's almost as if every song on this cd followed a formula (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental break, then chorus). it gets pretty boring at times, and it isn't worth owning. it might be worth burning from a friend. you'd be better off buying the new justin timberlake cd."
1,Crap,It works ok at first then the speaker craps out after about a week. I sent it back to NYCO they replaced it and the speaker craped out again after a few days. I gave up and now just use the Microsoft headset which has its own flaws but it still works at least.
2,"good songs, but a lot of lousy production","There are a few good songs, but as usual, the production is so dreadful that it destroys the music. Why on earth did they think that the 80s Holiday Inn drum kit with cheesy fills was a good idea?"
5,Stride Toward Freedom,I'm having trouble receiving this book for some reason. I cannot review it as of today.
2,Sony DVD-ROM Drive,"Drive was okay, however, it did not come with driver software and since my computer didn't provide one, I had to search the Internet (without success) to find one.Returned the drive for that reason."
4,Good?,"This racket is very good. It's little bit heavy, and need a lot of efforts if you want to put top spin on your ball, but the power is really great."
2,"mini-bagels, not full size","Based on the stated shipping weight (20.2 pounds) I thought these would be substantial, full size bagels. Nope, just little bagel treats. The dogs like them just fine, just not what I expected based on the description."
2,dissapointed,I am dissapointed to see that in spite of requesting expedited shipping this product will still arrive after Christmas. And I am also dissaponited because it was no option to write a greeting or something to identify who Santa was.
5,I Felt I Had Found The Singer/Songs I'd Been Looking For!,"This cd was great! I was sitting down in my friend's room and I heard it on her cd player and it really moved me. I was like, ""Man, this is the type of singer I've been looking for all along!"" I couldn't stop repeating how much I loved it! All of the songs on it were soft and moving. They were beautiful and so was her voice!"
5,"One of Twila Paris' Best, worshipful style, like Sanctuary","Clearly, this is one of Twila Paris' best. She again brings back her best style of music - Worshipful. Twila is good at pop but no one can beat her when it comes to drawing you in to sit at the footstool of the Master. God is worthy of all worship and Twila helps you to remember why."
5,Love them Irish vocals,"After watching and listening to Celtic Woman. I was hooked. I have purchased many other CD's by the other women. Hayley is outstanding, especially when she does Danny Boy. Have a tissue handy."
4,Celtic Treasure,Truly the voice of an angel - every so often a beautiful voice like Hayley's comes along and brings magic to the ears of those lucky enough to be listening.
2,Disappointing,"We first encountered Westenra as a member of the Celtic Woman group. She was great -- as were all the girls. Based on that, I selected this CD after reading the reviews on Amazon. This one seemed to get the best overall reviews.This CD is pretty uninspired and Westenra's voice sounds just average on several of the tracks. There are a few impressive spots but generally I thought the CD was less than expected."
2,Celtic Treasure,Beautiful voice. Not really what I expected but a nice addition to my collection of Celtic music.
5,The Christmas Secret,"This is a great movie for the family or even just for you. When the children grow up, you still remember the wonderful Christmas's you had at home. This movie gets you excited about Christmas. Love it - Love it. The movie was like brand new and it came in record time. Thanks"
1,Bad Bad Bad !!!,"Low quality.Self Hand wrapped.No ""Best Before"" Date,No Nutrition Fact,No INGREDIENTS."
5,one of my favorites!,"I read, re-read, and read it again as a young boy. Loved the fantasy of being able to fly and talk to animals and also the humor. Once they embark on their mission, there is also an exciting element of danger (not scary though). Highly recommended if your library has it."
2,Overpriced and Cheaply Made,"I ordered this item because I liked the design for storage of papers and stuff for my desktop. The package took a very long time to arrive. It is very cheaply made...particle board construction. Some pieces flaked off as I was putting it together. I needed it to be a specific size to fit on my bookcase, and it is approximately a 1/4 inch too wide.I would not recommend this product, and definitely would not purchase it again. I would return it if I could, but it would just be a huge hassle at this point. It is poorly made (particle board and dowels), and way...overpriced for what you get. Great design idea, if only they could put it together better."
2,Wish I'd kept looking,"This item looks far better in the product photos than in reality. It comes with marginal assembly instructions that are no more than vague pictograms. A few words of caution would help as trial and error is a crappy way to find out how not to hammer the back on. Ot is nearly impossible to put this together the first time without messing up the veneer and it's so cheezy that there will never be a second time. The materials are cheap. The back is cardboard, the shelves are cardboard, the particle board is low grade and the veneer is just plain nasty looking. It is serviceable but so is a cardboard box. It is ridiculously overpriced for what it is."
1,Poor qulaity,"Poor quality, flimsy, the back is a piece of cardboard. I would never recomend this itemfor any use. Will never last"
1,Safeco Wood Literature Organizer,"I was very disappointed in this item. I bought this item to use in my classroom. It was hard to put together; the pieces did not fit properly. The shelves themselves are flimsy, and the pegs are not long enough. I would not recommend this product."
2,Strange music...,"I was really disappointed by this so called Belly Dance album. Only the three first songs are OK, the rest I do not call bellydance music! Half of the songs are really slow and sounds all the same. I'm sure you can find better albums out there!"
5,Wonderful,I love love this show! It makes your mind think about the things that are possible to actually achieve today.
4,"A bit of a stumble in pacing, but ""Eureka"" is still going strong","I still love ""Eureka"". It's still a great show, and still very entertaining. But with Season 4.5, this was the first time that I didn't feel pulled in, and compelled to watch every episode as quickly as possible. The ""Mission to Titan"" story arc did not interest me too much, and something just seemed amiss... perhaps the absence of some characters (like Zoe and Beverly) is catching up to me. That's the only reason that I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. Nonetheless, I still enjoy watching the bumbling misadventures of Sheriff Carter, and I have my hopes high for a strong finale to this great series."
4,Eureka: Season 4.5,"Love Eureka but not a big fan of the eco-packaging or the split season. The disks are a bit more difficult to remove and the cardboard sleeve isn't gonna stand up well for long. I'll probably transfer to a standard DVD case ... so how is that eco-friendly?Season 4 started with a complete disruption to the story line but, finished on a good note so I encourage fans to keep watching."
5,Fun show to watch,"Over the last 10 years I've very rarely watched television, but when I saw the commercials for Eureka I was hooked. It's a great show and the only one that I've followed from beginning to end. Lots of cool scientific ideas. I was so disappointed when SiFy decided to end the show."
5,Out of this world,"Eureka has gone from strength to strength, never boring, the characters are so complex, all the actors are so well suited to this series, this season has gone back to it's bare roots, Eureka is really the thinking persons show, it combines humor, drama, scfi together, I could not wait to get this set, I sat down with popcorn in hand and watched the whole series in one hit, I really love this show, though I was disappointed to hear the next series number 5 will be the last, it's like losing an old friend, so sad, there will never be another Eureka, if you have not seen this series and are a scfi fan, do have a look, you will be hooked."
5,Who needs the Syfy channel without Eureka?,"Seriously. They are down to nubbins and absolutely pathetic, superstitious 'reality programming'. They have a gem in Eureka. A witty, wildly implausible and very enjoyable sci-comedy romp. This show is hands down the most original and creative offering on the boob tube. Maybe not the best show on TV, but certainly the most creatively scripted and developed dramedy going. I'll be deleting SyFy from my Fios favorites when this show goes dark - not to voice my displeasure with their abject stupidity, but rather, because of outside of Warehouse13, they'll simply have nothing to watch."
5,Love THE show.,"Love the show, period, end of statement!However:The packaging REALLY sucks (two-stars).The ""seasons"" so-confuses me that I almost missed THIS [4.5{!}] one.To remedy my almost watching programs out-of-sequence....and they jam up on my video shelves...I've repackaged them, myself, into NEW, replacement, 4&6-DVD-empty clear cases like THIS:Season 3 & 3.5 together ([only]4 discs)Season 3 as the outter wrapper with 3.5 cut to the inside spine.10 Clear Thin Quad Overlap DVD Empty Replacement Boxes / Cases with Wrap Around Sleeve #DV4R14CL (14mm) (4DVD)Season 4 & 4.5 together ([only]5 discs)Season 4 as the outter wrapper with 4.5 cut to the inside spine.10 Clear 6 Disc DVD CasesAnother fine show I LIKE with 5-star (*****) packaging is WAREHOUSE THIRTEEN (13) !While this might present no problem to a NORMAL video-collector, I have been ab-normal for 63 years.QUAD-CASES can be purchased from various places, but, of course, the CLEAR ones are the best-functioning; -made; and highest-tech!"
5,Great series,"The only drawback is the marketing ploy of separating the season into two parts. This seems to be a money making ploy. However, the series is great, with fantastic writing and great actors."
4,Eureka!!!!!,Good season. I liked it better before they started doing .5 or half seasons. Just wanting more money I guess.
3,Unfortunately,Love the series. Amazing and clever. Am disappointed that 2 episodes are missing. Had to buy them off iTunes just to see them
3,"Great show, poor disc quality","5 stars for the show, 1 star for the discs. I love the show, but the discs are something else entirely. When I insert the discs into my dvd player (which is fairly new), the discs won't properly load-the discs essentially cause my dvd player to shut itself off and I have to eject the discs and reload a few times for them to play. This has happened to me only one other time, with Season 5 of Sliders. Both sets have the same disc appearance and have been processed by Technicolor. Anyone else have this problem? I've played dozens of other dvds ranging from those bought 12 years ago to new ones and this has only happened with these two sets."
4,More Eureka,"A hidden plot may desroy Eureka; a Christmas Special, even a surprise cameo from Stan Lee. Other than that, more enjoyable Eureka times!Worth watching for people who are interested in science and possible advanced discoveries."
5,My favorite show.,This is my most favorite show. I couldn't wait to receive it. It's too bad that those in charge felt the need to break the season it two to increase revenue.
5,Like Walking on Pillows,These are the most comfortable shoes EVER. I wear them everywhere. They hold up really well and are wonderful for after a workout and into the public shower. It is so sad that Crocs is going out of business. These are great shoes. I stocked up and bought several pairs!
5,The title says it all,"I have not been able to stop listening to this...truly timeless. Almost every song, every arrangement is unique and inspiring. His version of ""I'm Glad There is You"" is particularly poignant and heartfelt....and the swingin arrangement on 'Young and Foolish' makes you wonder why it's not always done that way! ""Stolen Moments"" is just pure perfection. The sole disappointment on the album for me, is 'Moody's Mood for Love'...just a personal opinion. I highly recommend this for Mark Murphy fans and just plain jazz fans, in general."
1,Not What I Expected,"If you are looking for a directory on CHRISTIAN spiritual retreats, then this book is for you. However, for those of us looking for a spiritual, yet non-religious experience, then this guide is not helpful. I was hoping this directory would help me find spiritual retreats embracing a variety of practices. It did not. Otherwise, it is a well-organized and thorough guide within its narrow focus."
4,A Good Guide,"This book is easy to read and use. As the author of an inspirational book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL, I encourage everyone to seek the spiritual. And this guide will be handy as you do just that. Many blessings on your journey."
3,Girls of Summer doesn't do girls justice,"Lois Browne's ""Girls of Summer"" is a brief snapshot of the history of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League. As someone doing research on the league, the book comes up short on providing more than just basic knowledge on the subject. Browne does sufficiently describe the girls and the spirit of the league in this heartwarming narrative. Browne's intended audience is clearly the general public, not as much the historical crowd. The book does not have a bibliography which leads me to wonder where the author obtained most of her information. Despite lacking researchable qualities, the book is fairly easy and enjoyable to read as it is divided according to individual seasons. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for an introduction to the league."
4,Needs a Spark,"This is not disappointing at all, after all I am awarding 4 *s. But it is more a curiosity piece than one I'd listen too consistently. It's nice to hear some familiar songs done in a not so familiar way. Smokey Joe's Cafe not by the Robins but Buddy Holly (although I have more than one disc with Holly's on it), Stand by Me done by then Cassius Clay, Searchin' by Alvin Robinson, Spanish Harlem by Clyde McPhatter and more. There are also some songs that werre totally unknown to me. All fun to hear a time or two. The variation in the words of Lonnie Donegan's Sorry, But I'm Gonna Have To Pass from the more familiar Coaster's version now has me wondering which one is lyric written by L & S.For better Leiber and Stoller listening, I'd recommend Ace's L & S present the Spark Records Story. Overall the songs are less recognizable but are more satisfying after numerous listens.Better yet, buy both."
2,Rainbow's weakest album,"After three hard rock albums Blackmore thought it was time to get a bit more poppy in order to reach a larger audience (at this time he was very much into Abba). He changed the line-up, the sound and the songwriting and the result was an album that disappointed many a Rainbow fan. Graham Bonnet's a great singer, but you can't do an album without the help of the other musicians and they sure sound tired & uninspired here. With this line-up Rainbow was still a strong live-act though; just listen to the live compilation album ""Monsters of Rock"" if you can find it ! But Blackmore quickly realized that he had made a mistake and reformed the band with new singer Joe Lynn Turner and hot shot drummer Bobby Rondinelli. The album that would follow, ""Difficult to Cure"", got the band back on the right track with a good compromise between commercial songwriting and interesting playing. But he epical Dio-era would never return again !"
2,Down to Earth.... or below.,"I will have to agree with fellow headbanger Ozzy Nugent (great name) that ""Down to Earth"" serves as the weakest link in the mighty Rainbow kingdom. Bonnett definitely sounds like he's trying to muster something that's not there at all and Don Airey (normally an awesome keyboardist) provides featherweight imagery (see ""Eyes of the World""). Gone are the gothic themes, old-world sound through production, thanks to old pal Roger Glover, and that great Dio growl. I must say that this still ranks right in there with worst, tieing '81's ""Difficult to Cure."" Lone waking moment in Blackmore's fret cupboard: the devasting solo at the fade of ""Danger Zone."""
4,Down to earth...rock solid!,"Rumor has it that Ritchie asked Ian Gillan to handle vocal duties on this album,but he declined.With Graham Bonnet-powerful,bluesy vocalist-Rainbow began a new era,as Blackmore's musical taste shifted toward more straightforward territory.No compromises here;it's still a great Rainbow classic,revealing another of Blackmore's many musical facets."
2,Aptly titled. A great band in mediocre transition.,"Pre-DTE Rainbow was a veritable supergroup, putting out great album after great album. When Dio left, Blackmore was faced with a challenge, since he had lost an extremely talented and unique vocalist. The DTE Rainbow, fronted by Graham Bonnet (the blonde crewcut should have concerned someone) was a mediocre blues-rock combo that sounded eerily like a Deep Purple cover band. Replacing Bonnet with Joe Lynn Turner was the right move -- not so much to recapture the grit and snarl of the Dio years but to deliberately acknowledge moving towards a more pop sound. Every Rainbow album before DTE and after is better, and the two good-to-great songs -- Since You Been Gone and All Night Long -- are included on Very Best, which you should buy instead."
4,"""Down to Earth"" Shines Like the Colors of the Rainbow","Appropriately titled, this is unpretentious, hard-driving rock and roll at its best. There's plenty here to satisfy the palate. Whether its the FM staple ""Since You've Been Gone"", the ominous ""Eyes of the World"", the alternatingly herky-jerky/melodic ""Makin' Love"", the knock-your-socks-off ""Lost in Hollywood"", the blues-tinged ""Love's No Friend"", or the high-flying ""Danger Zone"", Don Airey's melodious, textured keyboard passages provide the perfect backdrop for Ritchie Blackmore's squeaky-clean leads. A must for any fan of the ""hard rock"" genre."
3,The Beginning Of The End,"This post-Dio release marks a detour from Metal Valhalla to a mundane AOR sound, trading art for the bucks. New aboard is vocalist Graham Bonnet one of the most underrated belters in rock's history. Blackmore and Bonett, along with Cozy Powell (drums), Don Airey (keyboards)and Roger Glover (bass, producer), excel on execution but fail on moving and shaking my skull as well as my emotional centers. ""All Night Long"", ""Since You've Been Gone"", ""Eyes Of The World"" and ""Lost In Hollywood"" are nice sonic works, but the final impression that I get from the album is somewhat sterile; the one you get from a simple entertainment product instead of the amazement you get from the artistic and sophisticated sonic landscapes of previous efforts. The beginning of the end."
4,How to Identify the Night Sky,This book is small and light weight. It is quite informative and has some great pictures of the sky with plenty of stars. This book shows constellations and many of the pictures you can use as a guide while you are star gazing. It is definitely useful for my use in Astrology class.
4,Good starter stargazer book,"For the price you can't go too wrong with this beginning astronomy book. The sky charts go to the year 2008 so don't wait too long to buy it.The included night sky charts are fairly self-explanatory, although it would have been nice if a large size pull-out style map had also been included. The text starts out basic and should be understandable for most beginners. The celestial sphere is descibed so that heavenly object positions make sense. The constellations are covered a lot (nearly half the book). Deep sky objects (galaxies, nebulae, clusters) are given much less attention.Overall not a bad choice."
1,"No Change, and such a hassle to take!!","This product did nothing for my hair growth and i took the pills as recommended. Let me tell you it is so annoying to take 8 pills a day! I have a life! I wouldn't recommend, I wasn't hoping for a miracle given the ingredients are vitamins and amino acids and I already was taking vitamins and eating extremely well. However, I was hoping to at least notice something. I have used for about 6 months since I had bought a package but will not repurchase."
2,Good...BUT... PAIN in the 'you know what' to take!,"I bought a 2 month supply of these (plus the herbal pills that can go with it)... its 10 pills a day!!! and you have to spread them out! even without the 'herbal helpers', it would 8 pills a day... and you HAVE to take them EVERYDAY... i understand their concept (that your body can only absorb so many vitamins at one time...so they divide up the dosages to get the maximum absorbtion...) but who has time for this stuff??I don't even work (stay at home mom)..and I couldn't even remember to take all of them... some you can eat with and some can not... its seriously a MISSION! I would rather just take 1 or 2 pilss a day, even if they don't work as well..HF37 does make the new hair look healthy.. but so does other vitamins.. i cannot say that this made my hair grow faster... only about 1/2 inch per month (which is the average hair gorwth rate, anyways!)Won't be buying this again... TOO MANY PILLS!!!!"
1,"Yes, Garbage, Indeed it Is!","Bell Harrah is so right! This things is indeed garbage! I have been using this things since March 9, 2005 and there is very LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. It still breaks, for goodness sakes, and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills?! It makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body, as it has not helped my hair and this month of May makes it 4 months I have been using. YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO SEE SOME HUGE CHANGES WITHIN A MONTH TO 45 DAYS, AND NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!! AND THE PILLS ARE SO DAMN EXPENSIVE!. i really don't have $57 to throw a way a month, so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work. I agree with the previous reviewer-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"Expensive, no noticeable change","I got my hair buzzed (female), this product didn't cause any noticeable increase in hair length. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and my hair hasn't even grown an inch. This product is a 30-day supply of 180step two+60step one pills. Go to their website rather than order off amazon to find more information."
5,AWESOME!!,"Insanely Awesome! I have had the same hair length for YEARS, something that most people find unbelievable. I couldn't get my hair to grow past my shoulders, I took biotin (which was useless), used shampoos and conditioners that were supposed to help stimulate hair growth, you name it, I've tried it...nothing ever worked for me. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to try it and I have been amazed at the results. My nails are growing insanely fast and strong- I've had to trim them at least 2x a week and my hair is noticeably thicker AND LONGER! Most hair products I've used only helped thicken my hair, but this is the 1st time I've used something that GROWS my hair. If you have difficulties getting your hair to grow past a certain length I highly recommended this product- I know it's expensive and it's a lot of pills to take in a day, but even after using this for only a month, the results have been definitely worth it."
2,READ THIS REVIEW,"BEWARE!! This product causes weight gain!! I used this product for a month and I gained almost 15 pounds!! I read reviews from other sites about this product and a lot of people had the same issue. It did not make my hair grow any faster. It did, however, make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it is not worth the weight gain."
1,Doesn't work and dangerous,I used this years ago and developed gout. The doctors said this caused it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS and safely use prenatals and Biotin instead.
5,All great things take time,I'm 21 and deployed for 6 months. I purchased this product my frist month here in the hopes of growing my hair out longer for Christmas. I have been using this product for about 3 months now. I am horrible at keeping on a pill poping schedule so I've missed a day or two here and there. However my hair has grown nearly 1 1/2 inches. My hair grows dreadfully slow so for me thats something to be proud of especially in such a short period of time. Once I get back to the states I am going to order this product again because it actually worked for me. Unfortunately not ever product works for everyone. You have to keep in mind that you can't continue to damage your hair and expect it to grow (the more you damage your hair the more you have to cut so you won't see any results).
2,Not in my experience,"In my experience with this product, I had NO SIGNIFICANT HAIR GROWTH. Very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it, and the amount of pills you have to take daily(UGH!). However, I gave it a two because while it didn't grow my hair, it did change the texture of it. My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable. Nice, if that's what you're looking for a hair vitamin to do. But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that."
2,didnt work,I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which I didnt mind its just the quanity .
3,"So far, so good",I haven't been taking them that long but they actually work. The fact that you have to take so many is really annoying. They are so big that you can barely swallow them but my hair and nails have grown. This is the 7th of December and I've only been taking them since November.
2,didnt work,I didnt see any difference in my hair growth. I was using prior to this groganic and my nails were longer and my hair was growing not alot but noticed a difference. so i decided to try this product but didnt see any hair growth at all.
1,Not worth the money,"I had hair extensions and wanted to get my hair healthy again. There was minimal breakage from the hair extensions and my hair was overall in great shape. I just wanted it to grow faster. I have been faithfully taking the vitamins as directed for 2 months and have seen little to no results, at least to not what I was expecting. My hair grows very slowly and was really wanting to get my hair to grow from the inside out. I did not see that much difference in my nails either. They grew fairly quickly but broke off as they are still brittle. I am going to finish the amount I have left and start taking Biotin after this. Much cheaper with same results."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product did exactly what I thought it would - nothing! But honestly, I can't blame anyone by myself. There is no such thing as a magic pill that is going to make your hair grow. I thought well if it doesn't do anything for my hair, it will do something for my skin, and it didn't. It was a complete waste of money and I will NEVER make this mistake again."
1,Dangerous!,"I bought this product directly from the company. I got really bad side effects. After drinking it a few hours later, I felt serious bad pain in my bone worst than arthritis. I had to stop before it killed. I called and got my membership cancelled."
4,Good Product,I think this is a good product. I have been taking the pills for 3 weeks. My hair feels strong. I would recommend it to others.
1,A POOR ATTEMPT TO RE-REALESE MUSIC FROM A GREAT BAND,"I LOVE AGRESSION BUT I DISLIKED THE SOUND QUALITY OF THIS CD.IT IS HORRENDOUS!!! MY EARS HURT AFTER TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE FIRST FEW SONGS(VERY NOISY AND DISTORTED).THIS IS A VERY BAD REMASTERING JOB. IT IS SACRILEGE!!! THIS SAME MATERIAL HAS ALREADY BEEN REISSUED ON MYSTIC RECORDS(THE ORIGINAL LABLE)AND IT SOUNDS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BETTER THAN THIS CLEOPATRA RELEASE. IT IS TOO BAD THAT A GREAT BAND LIKE AGRESSION IS REPRESENTED THIS WAY.IF YOU LIKE AGRESSION I SUGGEST BUYING THE ""DONT BE MISTAKEN"" CD(BYO). THANKS FOR READING THIS!!!"
1,Dissapointed Sea & Cake Fan,"As a big fan of Jim O Rourke, Tortoise, Sea & Cake, & Sam Prekop, I could not wait to here this solo artists work.What a dissapointment. There is absolutely no similiarity with this music and the smooth, avant garde sound in which I have become a big fan. This album is so disjointed, its unbearable. I wrote this so fans would be aware that this is different stuff than I would expect from any Sea & Cake members. Be warned!"
4,Calif. cookie cutter,"I use this product for my 4th graders to learn the regions of California, a state geography standard. I ""con"" two moms into making 34 sugar cookies, and coloring frosting blue, green, and yellow. Blue is coastal range, yellow is desert, green is Central Valley. The mountains are chocolate frosting. We also mark Sacramento and Lake Tahoe. The students can't eat the cookie until every state at their table is marked correctly. I did this for my observation by my principal last year; she loved it."
5,Finally!,"Finally a travel guidebook that offers something other than meaningless fluff! Passov is a great storyteller who relates what's its really like to play some of the best golf courses in the eastern U.S. You'll want to clean the grass off your shoes after browsing the chapters. In addition to honest and informed opinions on the golf courses, Passov also provides an encyclopedic amount of information on resorts, restaurants, and other activities in the vicinity of the golf courses. If all guidebooks were this breezily written, entertaining, and full of hardore travel info, you'd never have a bad vacation or a disappointing round of golf. My only hope is that Passov will cover the rest of the country-- and the world-- soon so I know where to go next for a great golf vacation."
5,Beautiful illustrations,Maurice Pledger's illustrations are beautiful. Board pages are good- children cannot rip or tear out. I also recommend 'An Adventure with Polly Polar Bear' and 'Bobby Bear's ABC's'.
1,"Not ""Bomber""","I totally agree with another reviewer, in that I was disappointed with this book. After reading ""Bomber"", I was expecting a similar book about (what else) fighters. This is not a story in that genre, or up to that standard, so much as a love story not very well done."
3,$380?,"$380 for this card? LOL. You guys are flat out, out of your minds. Bought this new when it came out for $100. Can find it now on eBay new for $50.$380, HAHAHAahahah. Oh man, never laughed so hard in my life.This is an awesome card though. Better than Creative's new X-Fi notebook offering."
3,"Fantastic product, but...","The only reason I'm not giving this card 5 stars is because I've had mine for about 1 1/2 years now, and it is falling apart. The plastic on it seems brittle and doesn't take shocks or being stored with other plastic items very well. The sleeve that you're supposed to keep the card in when you're not using it is very easy to lose as well.Sound-wise, though, this is the best audio I've ever heard on a notebook, hands down. Installation was a breeze, and the system didn't lose the old sound drivers either, so I can switch to the onboard sound if needed (for example, just setting up for a quick email check or something - you don't *have* to plug the card in to get sound).If the card had been made a little tougher, maybe I wouldn't be looking to replace the one I have now with something else."
2,Nice at first .....,"I purchased these because they are organic and neutral. Simple and absorbent, but the satin frayed and the terry tore at the seams after a few uses and washes. I am quite particular about my laundry, so this was not me being careless and tough on the fabric. I am very disappointed with the quality of these bibs and will be printing out my return label when finished with this review!"
4,"Simple, Soakable, Bib",These bibs were exactly what I was looking for. My little guy is five months old and has begun the mega drool stage. I was having to change his shirt or outfit every hour because he would be soaked with drool from chin to tummy. He also likes to chew and suck on bibs when they are on him so I was looking for something without dyes or cutesie patchwork. These bibs do the job and I don't worry what he may be ingesting. I put one on in the morning and change it about noon.I have put these through the washing machine several times. After the first wash I found that some of the threads were loose and if you ran your fingers over the bib strings would come loose. I just washed them again and the loose threads came all the way off and I haven't seen the same problem since.
3,Ok but not great,These bibs are absorbent but after half a dozen washes the bibs are already falling apart. There are loose threads all over. The velcro is VERY strong so I suspect the fabric is getting shredding in the velcro teeth. I've found the velcro can also scratch the back of the baby's neck if you don't cover it completely. They're ok bibs but not great...
1,Not What It Used to after August 2010,"My son has been using these since he was a newborn. He's now two years old and, unfortunately, still need to wear a bib to keep his shirts dry. These are the most absorbent bibs I have seen in the market and he can soak these through three of these in day. After a year of use, the first batch I bought were stained and I wanted to buy new ones to replace them. But the new ones I bought after August 2010 are nothing like the old ones. They are less absorbent, the velcro stick to my other clothing and itself during laundry (despite I religiously close the velcro before putting them into the laundry) and they fall off my son's neck. Totally useless piece of junk if you ask me. All I can do now is to go back using the original ones I bought two years ago that are yellow. It's not pretty but at least it does the job."
2,Not impressed,"I registered for these for my baby shower and received them. I liked the fact that they were made organically because babies like to chew on anything they can get ahold of, bibs included. Once I received them though, I was disappointed at how thin they were. I had hoped that an organic product, obviously lacking a plastic lining for the back, would have been nice and thick. These, not so much. They are very thin. I know there are better organic bibs on the market and I stupidly thought 3 organic bibs for $11 was a good deal. And it was...too good to be true!"
2,"Looked great, at first","When I first got these they looked and felt great, but after only one washing one of the bibs fell apart and the other two shrunk up and don't look all that great anymore. I would not recommend these bibs."
1,Expensive but cheap!,"These bibs are expensive, but extremely cheap. The velcro does not work after one wash and they fall apart after two washes and then look like a rag. I would not recommend nor buy any more of these products."
1,Bumpkins not so great,"I bought the Bumpkin bibs with the (blue) silk trim and they were pretty awful. The trim began to fray after one washing, attracting every piece of velcro in my baby's wardrobe (other bibs, including Bumpkins) in the dryer. A pretty disappointing purchase. The cloth itself held up well, but the trim became so frayed I didn't want it near my infant. For a company that touts itself as being ""finer baby products"" it may want to look at the quality of its fabrics."
3,"Very creative, but very outdated","This book has some of the most beautiful, interesting looking resumes I've ever seen. I don't know if fancy resumes with tonnes of graphics actually work or not, but if you are going into Visual Arts field (esp. design), this is worth checking out. These resumes are sure to catch attention. On the other hand, the contents of resumes are unbelievably outdated - they are all from 80's. Many resumes include their marital status, headshots, and all other sort of things we never put on a resume in year 2000. Look at the designs, but get another book on how to WRITE an updated millenium resume!"
2,Skip this one,"This book is in serious need of an update! Perhaps back in 1985 this was the definitive source on resumes for creative professionals. Although even then, I doubt it. It is pretty obvious that this book was published in the era before personal computers. Most of the resumes use courier for their typeface and many have random clipart all over the place. It is now 2007, if you sent one of these resumes to a design firm you would be the laughing stock of the industry. The author stresses the importance of color and yet the book is published in black and white. There are probably about two acceptable resumes in this book. I'm so glad that I checked this book out of the library instead of purchasing it. If I were you, I'd skip this one."
2,Berryman's resumes,Not great. Too much old info and bad examples. Not college level quality at our institution.
2,no caps please,"the only prob. i had with it is it was written in all caps, which the book itself warns against....."
3,Well explained and interesting but limited,"I have three of Azby's books and while each has different strengths and weaknesses I think this was the least interesting of the three.If you are planning to build or simply interested in wooden temple/shrine complexes then this is an in depth study on the subject and you will surely be pleased with the detail and photos provided.If however you are interested in Japanese ""carpentry"" in a larger sense - basic principles, joints, techniques, examples of use in housing and furniture, you will be disappointed as this book really should be called ""Carpentry of Japanese Shrines/Temples""."
3,Made in China,"I was all set to buy this jointer until I saw where this product was actually manufactured. I had just recently purchased a Unisaw, which has been completely solid in performance, and amazingly made in the U.S. I don't doubt the Jointer would be good, but I couldn't bring myself to purchase this jointer with a Delta name and made in China, when I could for 30 dollars less, purchased the JET 708457K / JJ-6CSX Jointer, and have a product made in Taiwan, which tend to have much better production standards than China. Had this jointer been made in Taiwan, like their Delta 37-350A DJ-20 8"" Precision Jointer, I would have been glad to buy it in a second."
2,Can you spell cheaply made junk?,"I made the mistake of buying a Delta product thinking that there was some quality behind the name.Wrong.Out of the box it became apparent that the equipment was sub standard, the paint on the cabinet was stained, the edges of the machined surfaces were chipped and the fit and feel of the geared parts was rough.I have not tried to use the equipment yet, sill thinking about returning it and buying a better quality item.You have to wonder if the companies that market products in the US will ever stop placing profit over quality. Obviously Delta Woodworking Tools has not!I had been looking at a high-end cabinet saw and after getting a load of this Delta Jointer, there is no way that I would even consider wasting my money on one made by this company."
2,"Mine had problems, decided to return","Unfortunately, my 6"" X5 jointer started off in bad shape. The motor would only spin up half the time. I adjusted belt tension and pulley alignment properly with no improvement. The fence was off by .008"" after all possible adjustments. The fence handles never tightened properly, just spun in the cast iron. There were a few other more minor issues. Delta directed me to a local repair shop to fix the motor. This shop wanted me to load the entire machine instead of just swapping the motor so I decided that if I was loading it up I would do it once and return it. I own other Delta products that I am very happy with and plan to buy one of their drill presses this week. But, for this tool I decided to replace this jointer with the Jet unit which is working great. Given all the positive reviews of this jointer, I can understand if this was a one-off bad unit that I got. Hope it works out better for you."
4,"Delta 6"" Jounter","typical Delta product, does what they say it will do, good quality, excellent QA, and good value."
3,cd,I didn't know the cd was recorded live when I purchased it. It sounds ok and if you like James Brown live recordings then you'll like this cd.
4,Generally untechnical but still wonderful,"Generally an excellent work, used for scholarly purposes in re: the trial of warren hastings."
1,Defective item. Bad service from tiger direct/ ADS Tech.,"The item was defective, it made a spark and smoke while connecting to my laptop but, my laptop's system board is burnt. But they wouldn't refund the whole, only refunded item cost out of total (item + original shipping + return shipping), not to mention my laptop's cost. Tigerdirect and ADS Tech are both not customer minded at all."
1,1st Book I've Ever Thrown Directly In the Trash,"This book was so weird and creepy that it was the first book I've ever thrown directly in the trash. I felt a teensy bit bad throwing a book in the trash. Couldn't I donate it to a library? A hospital? A school? GOD no. It's so awful that I wouldn't feel ok about doing that! Couldn't I gift it to someone I don't like? NO way. No kids deserve to be punished by reading this book, no matter how annoying, they or their parents are. DO NOT BUY THIS CREEEEEEPY BOOK. Or at the very least, read it before you buy it! My bad."
5,What a story!,"My favorite thing about Deaf in Delhi is the narrator's voice. He tells so many entertaining, heartbreaking, and funny stories from a perspective that captures him at a particular age in his life, but also with the wisdom of a man looking back at his life. A very inspiring story that easily connects reader to writer--you will feel as if you have just started a new friendship after reading it."
5,Great insight into acting,"OK, did you ever have the experience where you have run into someone you went to high school with, and you keep thinking "" Wow, when did they get so smart""? Well, I have always thought Seth Barrish was smart. It is a pursuit of integrity for those who persue it and love it.This boIt is a pursuit of integrity for those who persue it and loveit.... But this is a wonderful book about the realities of what it like to be an actor. Acting isn't just about strikes and oscars, affairs and drug problems...it is a craft...it is a life's work. It is a pursuit of integrity for those who persue it and love isThis book not only reveals a lot of knowledge but is extremely humble and funny. This is not a pretentious tome, but a wonderfully brief, insightful and readable acting book. If you ever want to find out what actors do, and don't want to watch inside the actors studio...then this isthe book for you..."
4,"4 stars for fans, 3.5 for neutral observers...","This Spanish trio is one of the most creative and eclectic world music bands of recent vintage... This is a driving, dynamic live set that captures a more aggressive side of Radio Tarifa's sound, in particular a tilt toward jazz-tinged improvisation, and an emphasis on individual virtuosity and impassioned, in-the-moment performances. Personally, I'm more drawn to the moody melodic side that the group shows on its studio albums, but this album does show that they can summon a lot of live-action firepower as well, and aren't just another pretty-sounding world-music studio project. If you're a Tarifa fan already, you'll probably want to check this out."
2,uncomfortable and odd fit,"I was excited to receive my oxfords, but unfortunately ended up very disappointed. After only 4 hours of wearing them I could hardly walk, as they were so uncomfortable. They also had a bad fit on the sides which rubbed the top of my foot. I don't think 4 hours of wear was worth the $40 price. The shoes look very durable, but they'll probably last a very long time sitting in my closet."
2,Cry For A Wannabe,"The two songs here that are performed by JUST The Beatles are high quality. John Lennon has a lot of confidence in his voice on ""Ain't She Sweet,"" especially for so young a singer. He completely blows away Tony Sheridan, who is the lead singer on the other vocal tracks (some of which don't include The Beatles at all). Sheridan is trying to sound like a composite of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins, but his voice just can't cut the mustard. This music is interesting because it is history, but with the exceptions of ""Ain't She Sweet"" and the instrumental ""Cry For A Shadow,"" it's not very good sounding music."
1,A Stretch,Unless you need to hear Tony Sheriden you are better off not buying this. I found it a waste of money and even mentioning the Beatles is trickery. This CD has nothing to do with them. Sure they are playing on it but the sound quality is poor and nothing distinctive about their playing makes this worth while. That's just my opinion.
1,What a [poor bargain],These aren't the Beatles. This is Tony Sheridan. I'm only giving it one star cause it's stereo.
2,over the top,"This would be a pretty decent CD if the drumming wasn't so over the top. Richard Christy is an awesome drummer and as a drummer myself, I have great respect for him. His playing on this album is way too over-the-top as it's focusing on him. He has little respect for the music and it's almost like an accompanying band for his drumming. The album would be awesome if it wasn't for the drumming. If you want a good burning inside album, check out Apparition. The drumming doesn't ruin the good album on that one. Christy's playing on The eve of the Entities reminds me a lot of his playing on the sounds of perseverence by Death. This review is coming from a drummer who's favorite kind of music is old and new school death metal."
5,It all started from a t-shirt.,"I first noticed their name on countless musician's t-shirts bearing the bands logo, then one reviewer said that they're one of the best things to come out of Florida. From there on I took noticed. Having a fine blend of brutal, death and black metal they stand on their own with the likes of ATHEIST and CYNIC."
3,"If you like depech mode and understand spanish, here you go!",This is he Spanish Depech Mode. the singer sounds like Dave and the music is what depech mode sounded like in the 80's.
4,Remarkable Adaptation...,"In my freshman literature seminar, I was put on the spot by my professor and asked how I liked Pride and Prejudice. After a few throat clearings, I admitted that I had not been a fan and in fact found the language so dry so as to make the novel boring. I certainly am not alone in thinking this, and most who do tend to be male. That being said, this movie was incredibly entertaining. I've heard marvelous things about the long BBC version (many people watched it instead of reading the book for my seminar), but it's hard to imagine it being better than this. Knightley reminded me of Winona Ryder in Little Women and played her character splendidly. I highly recommend this for girls and guys alike. You'll love the dry British humor and the wonderful scenery. Maybe even more than the book itself."
2,Cliff Notes version of P&P,"I purchased this on a friend's recommendation, but I wish I had read more of the reviews first. An earlier reviewer described this as P&P as written by Charlotte Bronte and that about sums it up. Austen's sly social commentary and witty observations on human nature have been replaced by atmospheric shots of rain-drenched, fog-filled gloom and wavering shadows in candle-lit rooms. Elizabeth comes across as shrewish and broody, with none of the vivacity and quick wit of the original. Darcy seems dull and socially backward instead of a man restrained by his own rigid view of propriety and his place in the social caste. The secondary cast get only one or two pertinent lines from the novel to establish their character and motives, which reduces the circumstances that drive the plot to a one-dimensional Cliff Notes version of P&P."
4,Classic Romance,A great watch if you're looking for a fuzzy love story. It's not terribly far from the book though quite abbreviated in comparison to previous adaptations.
5,Very well done!,"Kiera Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen give absolutely exquisite performances! This is one of my favorite movies! If you're like me, a hopeless romantic,you won't be disappointed!"
2,Quality of the reproduction was poor...,"I love this movie; one of my favorites. The quality of the dvd is poor. It hesitates throughout the whole movie. I have yet to return it (life has been very busy) but I intend to. Because I haven't returned it yet, I cannot comment on customer service."
3,anana,"P&P has been my favorite book for many years. This version of the film feels like it comes from a well-intentioned reader who was touched by the novel, but only put what he or she remembered into a movie about it. It's sweet, but the dialogue is difficult to understand at times. Austen fans are better off sticking with the BBC version starring Colin Firth."
3,Very quiet surround audio,"The audio on 5.1 is very very quiet, had to turn the volume up to near the maximum to hear the voices, all other sounds are super loud at that volume."
2,Mediocre at best,"I did not care for this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. I think it impossible to do P&P any kind of justice in 2 hours. I felt that they tried too hard to pack the story into too short a time. They glossed over, skipped and condensed too many events that, in my opinion, were essential to the build up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. You get no sense of Darcy's struggle with his attraction. You barely get any sense of his attraction at all. Overall, I am left with a sense of meh."
3,Disgusting DVD,This DVD came and the box of it was absolutely disgusting. It looked like it had been given to a dog/cat to play with as a chew toy....and there was some kind of white substance that was gooey that was on it. The DVD itself worked fine....but the case was nasty. Probably wouldn't buy from this seller again....
4,P N P,"I read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and now after watching Pride and Prejudice, i'm finally reading the regular book itself. Anyway, this film stuck to the book. The cast was well choosen and the whole of the film was entertaining. I enjoy the story of Eliza Bennet and Mr. Darcy. I must watch the film again though since i can't recall certain parts that i'm readin from the book right now. The book is easier to read than Sense and Sensibility but watching the film first does help you with understanding the plot and characters for sure."
5,A wonderful family movie!,"This movie is a wonderful story.A romanic, and hopeful story.I loved the original movie and the book and this version is just as wonderful.I loved all the stars in this movie,they were all so great and captured the there carectors so well. this movie has love,comedy,and inspiration. truly a clasic move."
3,"Just ""okay"".","I have viewed the 2 versions the BBC put out and now this one. While I like the casting of characters in this one, the setting left a LOT to be desired, and the shortness left out the development of the characters and the relationships. Jane and Lizzy have little warmth or closeness in this version as there is no time to develop the relationship. Everything is too much abbreviated for comfort. Anyone seeing this and not having read the book as often as I and some other avid readers would come away feeling it was too shallow a story. Few of the statements from the book carry into the movie, as they did in the BBC versions. It's too different from the book for my liking, although I will continue to view it from time to time along with the others."
2,Not a quality HD,"This review pertains to the medium rather than the movie itself (which I really enjoy). Do not purchase this movie in HDDVD. There were parts where the film appeared ""dotted,"" almost like watching it on a computer screen. I was pretty excited about seeing the movie in high-def, but the quality was actually worse than the regular DVD. Bottom-line: don't waste your money on the HD, just purchase the standard DVD."
1,****DOES NOT WORK******,IT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO GET THE MOVIE BUT IT FINALLY ARRIVED. THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I SAW IT WAS THAT IT LOOKED A COPY AND TO TOP THINGS OFF IT DIDN'T WORK!!!!! THEY SHOULD'VE AT LEAST SENT ME A WORKING COPY....LOL.... OH WELL I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR.
3,Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightly,"To put it simply, in this version of P&P;, it is not the wonderful characters that Jane Austin created that are highlighted, it is the actors, mainly Miss Keira Knightly. This version goes way off track from the novel and didn't bring anything new or exciting to the adaptation except the popularity of it's leading lady. A better title for this remake would have been ""Keira Knightly's Pride and Prejudice"". Stick with the BBC Colin Firth version.I gave it three stars because the actor, Matthew Macfaden who plays Mr. Darcy is a favorite of mine from MI5, and The Pillars of the Earth.Pride and Prejudice (Full Screen) (2005)"
1,Pride & PRejudice HD DVD,Apparently an HD DVD is so out of date that nobody even uses them anymore. I was trying to replace a DVD that I borrowed and lost. I think it would have been fair business practice for the seller to include in the description that this was not an actual DVD and that the buyer would need to be specifically looking for an outdated and unusable (by most people) product in order to make use of this purchase. BUYER BEWARE
2,"I love Jane Austen, But I HATED it","Call me a Jane Austen Purist but i hated this movie, I did. I tried to bring myself to like it, but I feel as if the A&E; version was more closer to the time, the era, the clothing, the language, the seting, etc.And then the constant childish giggling, this is not the Lizzie I know.The more I watched of the film the more I saw characters being destroyed. For example, Mr. Bennett was just not believable to me and Mr. Colins was poorly cast. I just didn't like this film, even I did think that Mcfayden did a good job in presenting darcy but I don't know, this film just did not do it for me. I feel as if Jane AUsten would be rolling in her grave if she saw this version. I do. I dont know how else to describe my disapointment......"
3,Austin It's Not,"I guess I am too much of an Austin fan to enjoy this rendition very much. Not only are there many changes and additions to Austin's plot, but the setting is partially wrenched from the early 19th century to add some of today's manners. Yet Austin's stories are all about manners! I didn't like it that the father figure is portrayed looking like a drunk on a 5-day binge (extremely dirty and messy looking, 5-day's beard, stringy hair)rather than as an intellectual. I didn't like that the portraits of Georgiana and Darcy were transformed into nude statues (with Jane looking pointedly at the front of the male version). Mr. Collins I found more earnest than stupid. Some changes were of course necessary to shorten the story, but I found many changes that didn't need to be made, that for me detracted from the whole."
2,Completely disappointing...,"In no way does this version compare to the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The actors, the inferior cinematography, the condensed story, and the lesser costume designs - all sorely disappointed me. I'm sure those that have never seen the A&E version will find this a good movie, but I just don't see how anyone who is familiar with the Firth/Ehle film can be satisfied with this new version. I have no desire to ever watch this film ever again."
2,Lackluster and Uninspired,"Yawn. While remaining more or less true to the original, I found the performances and as well as the script of this latest version of Pride and Prejudice lacking. It seemed to move at a snail's pace and I had to keep bumping up the volume to catch the dialogue. The characterizations were lackluster and the performances uninspired.Save your money and buy the BBC version. It's far superior to this one in every way--and even at four hours long, it moves faster than this one."
3,Alright for a 'kids' movie,"I bought this movie because I adored Kiera Knightly in Pirates of the Carribean.At the same time, I purchased the 1995 BBC mini-series. On watching the two back-to-back, there just is no comparison. The 1995 version is simply wonderful with a great deal of depth. Of course, you can get deeper in five hours than you can two!Watching the Kiera Knightly version, didn't peak my interest to actually read Pride & Prejudice, but the 1995 version did.I wish that more of Jane Austin had been used in this version of the movie. Many changes were made to lines to appeal to a younger audience, but not for the better. Jane Austin's are hard to improve upon.However, The cinematography was beautiful and I did like that Meryton was shown more the way that it might have been at the time.Overall, I found the movie cute and with no depth. Good try, but if you have time go for the BBC mini-series version!"
1,Not Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy more like Cathy and Heathcliff,"Silly, silly movie ... I have to admit, there was heat between Darcy and Lizzy, but not the right kind. This was a brewding melodrama at time, more in keeping with Wuthering Heights, not a light hearted witty story of the ""Pride"" of Mr.Darcy & the ""Prejudice"" Miss Elizabeth Bennet. And PLEASE someone tell me the importance of That HUGE PIG and focusing on his ""under parts"", as he walked thru the house. What did that have to do with anything??? Needless to say 1 Star is being generous for this film ..."
3,Not a great film,"I love everything P&P, but I was so disappointed with this version. The BBC version was so much better. I can watch this one but I prefer the Colin Firth version."
2,Save your money. Do something else with your 2 hours,"We're pretty accepting of second rate remakes. But this one is just too bad. The characters are 2 dimensional at best. Knightly's acting is -- well, it isn't acting.The story line is only slightly muddled. Silly liberties were taken, throughout that modernized a story that doesn't need to be modernized.Several thumbs down."
5,Pride and Prejudice 2012,"The movie quality was very good. Packaging was in tact, and I enjoyed the movie. Yay. It came in a timely manner.I think it was a great purchase and very happpy with it."
4,Great drama.,"I received the Blu-Ray version today and was totally unprepared for the audio track. The musical sound is exceptionable. The transfer is top notch. Clear and bright. I have owned other releases of this and this is by far the best one. All the actors are invested in their role. I especially like Kiera Knightly's efforts. Brenda Blethyn as nearly insufferable Mama. Donald Sutherland as long suffering Papa. Jena Malone's turn as the silly fifteen year old sister. When Elizabeth escapes to the, what should I call it, shelter near a lake during a rainstorm and Mr. Darcy follows her and they argue was a great scene. Judi Dench and Kiera's rapid fire repartées are beautiful to behold. At the end when the view of Mr. Darcy's home across the lake was shown, there were swans swimming about. Was this a reference to Swan Lake? A suggestion that Elizabeth was a ""swan"" who needed love to become human? Well, who doesn't need that? I doubt that I can improve on other's reviews so I won't try."
5,beautiful and moving,"great acting by everyone, a true experience of the time, wish there were more movies like thisi will watch this one again."
5,Pride and Predjudice,Loved this movie! The acting and scenery exceeded my expectations! It is so unusual for Hollywood to make good wholesome movies; so was pleasantly surprised when they made this movie. Such an endearing classic book; movie was a tribute. Saw the movie when it came out and always look forward to these classic movies - so far and few between!
5,Romance!,I love this version of this story. Kiera Knightly nails Elizabeth Bennett. The sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett is palpable!
3,"Good, but could have been better","Except for the ending, I have few problems with the adaptaiton. Even these issues were slight, falling under the ""not how I would have done it"" category rather than the ""what were they thinking?"" heading. But then, a faithful translation would run far too long for a feature film (c.f. the A&E version, which runs to six hours). And in spite of the absence of Colin Firth, it was well-acted -- Keira Knightly's Elizabeth in particular. My only real issue with this adaptation, and the only thing in the way of a fourth star, is the complete elimination of Jane Austen's original ending in favor of one that is overly Hollywoodized."
2,Pride and Prejudice as written by Charlotte Bronte,"Lovely movie artfully done. But not Jane Austen. This a gothic novel with Austen characters. This is an adaptation of Jane Eyre, or Wuthering Heights, or Rebecca. Overwrought, dark and brooding. Where Austen novels are wry and clever, and always understated. If I had never read Austen I would have enjoyed it. But I have and it is jarring. It certainly is better than the 1940 version with Greer Garson, but barely."
5,Magnificent,"Joe Wright has done a wonderful job creating these vivid characters in the big screen from the book Pride and Prejudice. Every element of the story was conveyed in an artistic way with foremost respect to the integrity of the original piece. The eloquent portrayal of the story of Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy was complemented with an excellent soundtrack, which served as the motif throughout the entire picture. Joe Wright perspicacious vision of this film has propagated a work of art that culminates this romantic love story in the most inspiring manner."
2,Thumbs down,I hated this version. They didn't stick to the true dialog and plot of the book. I did not like Kiera Knightly as Lizzy at all!!!!I give it 2 stars because the color/visuals was very well done.Give me the A&E; version please.
4,It could be perfect,"I love this film and saw it several times at the cinema. I even bought a bigger television especially for when this film came out on dvd and I love it as well as the Colin Firth mini-servies AND the book. I bought a copy and then ordered the 2 disc special edition. This film, to my utter horror has the ""American"" ending with the unlikely scene of Mr and Mrs Darcy ""making out"" in front of the lake at Pemberley, most un-Jane Austen like and an option to view with my original copy which I shall now watch in preference. The cast is wonderful, the music, everything but THAT ending."
2,Very Disappointing,"Okay. I absolutely love the book and have read it more times than I should admit, and I love the miniseries which did a wonderful job at capturing the essence of the book, but this movie is just AWFUL. It leaves out detail after detail and rushes you from one event to the next never giving the viewer a full explanation or even time to form any opinions. The characters in the movie do not seem fully developed; they are like chess pieces being moved by a higher power without knowing its or their intention.Bottom line: this movie is a shell of the book. It should never have been made. And I feel the only people who can find true enjoyment in this adaptation are those who have never read Austen's masterpiece."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"The only reason I gave this film two stars is that I thought the scenery and cinematography was beautiful. Other than that, I was very disappointed. I tried watching this with an open mind (OK..it may not be exactly true to the book, but try to judge it on its own merit.) Well I'm sorry this movie had no merit. Acting was lame (even though many of the actors in this movie have done great work in the past), and obviously the writers made no effort to at least try to remain true to the original story at least a little bit. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my favorite novels, but this film did it no justice whatsoever."
1,I would give it a negative million if I could!,"This movie is a dumbed-down version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. None of the characters are faithfully portrayed. I would be ok with changes and creative edits if it were not for the fact that the characters have been morphed into either blubbering idiots (Mr. Bingley) or melodramatic ninnies who cry in almost every scene and physically run away from all conflict (Elizabeth Bennett). This movie has exchanged wit for stupidity, charm with repulsive cheesiness, and even rid the thing of every piece of sarcastic humor that existed. Mr. Bennett cries in this movie for Christ sake! It really is the antithesis of what Pride and Prejudice was all about. I'm extremely saddened that yet another classic story has been destroyed by Hollywood."
2,It's not the A&E,"If you love the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice, don't watch this adaptation, if you love the Book don't watch this adaptation. The Characters aren't believable as the people they portray. It's like watching the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma... much to Hollywood for me."
5,P&P,"I love this movie! It has just enough romantic air, humor, troublesome twists and drama to keep me on the edge of my seat! I first rented this movie, and then knew I had to buy it. While very few of my friends and family are as crazy about it as I am- I still watch it, even if by myself."
2,FRENCH ADAPTATION?,"This was a total disappointment. Everything from script, set and costume design, to actual filming angles and editing FLAWED. Who ever heard of the British Army wearing BLUE COATS? And all of the FRENCH set design elements? And where was the wit and intelligence which was and is JANE AUSTIN? If you are looking for the best contemporary version of Pride and Prejudice, look no further than the mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. All the elements were correct and the acting was leaps and bounds better than this latest attempt!"
1,HD -DVD DON'T BUY,"I bought this movie for a friends Birthday. One thing the company doesn't tell you is that HD-DVD is no longer in buisness since Nov 2008, so you pay for something you can't even use. I tried to turn it over to see if it had standard DVD on the other side - it doesn't! I gave to my friend for her Birthday and now I can't return it because I bought it in oct for her Birthday in Dec, and it has been over 30 days.Oh, and on the inside it has a note to go to[...] for firmware updates and the site is no longer there. Also, the note shouldn't be on the inside it should be on the outside of the package. This product shouldn't even be on the shelves and I ended up learning about HD-DVD being out of business from the article below.[...]"
3,Not as good as usual,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my son's birthday. When he received it the case was cracked, and it smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. We both have a problem with the smoke and I was disappointed that it would be shipped out like that. The actual DVD plays ok, but the packaging was very poor on this item. Ellen Peacock"
1,P&P- lite,"Pride and Prejudice is so much more than this hollywood-ized version. If one wants a more faithful and deeper (that captures important nuances in the characterization and plot of the novel) adaptation with regards to the highly acclaimed Jane Austen novel (which after all is the BASIS of this film), go get the BBC 1995 version with Jennifer Ehle (who won the BAFTA best actress for television for her performance) and Colin Firth (who was nominated for BAFTA best actor for his performance."
5,My favorite movie,"I saw this movie the first time in 2005, and LOVED it. I enjoyed this movie so much that I decided to read the book, and to be honest I'm wasn't a fan of classical romance or any kind of romance ( and I'm girl) but that all changed after P & P. I love Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy.He was born to play Mr.Darcy.And Keira Knightley is a excellent actress and she did a superb job as Elizabeth. I recommend this movie to everyone I know because it made a great impression on me.This movie really makes you feel so many emotions, you'll cry, laughed, and at the end you will truly believe in true love.P.S.: I tried to watch the 1995 BBC P & P but in my opinion the actors portraying the characters are so bland and boring, but again that's MY opinion."
2,Not as great as the first one!,"This is not the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. They are a bit too stuck on themselves, too impressed with their own talents. It bespeaks arrogance rather than quality. The characters in the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth have a sweetness that is complimented by intelligence. Even the bonus features betray that the actors are more impressed with themselves than they are interested in delivering a great performance. I fault the director to a degree. He shifts many lines that were meant for the young ladies' father in the story to Keira Knightly. She comes off as pompous rather than intelligent. A failing strung throughout the entire showing."
1,This movie is NOT Pride and Prejudice!,"Maybe by putting the symbol ""&"" instead of the word ""and"" they were trying to tell us something!! I've read this book so many times I have many scenes memorized by now! The A&E (Firth version) was good! The old 1980 BBC version was COMPLETELY the story right out of the pages of the book! And when I close my eyes and imagine Darcy, I see David Rintoul!! However, this movie is NOT Pride and Prejudice by any stretch of the imagination! Perhaps, if they had given it a different title and not tried to pretend that it was Pride and Prejudice, I could give it more stars in its own right! I can't imagine how ANYONE who has read and loves the book can possibly even LIKE this movie!"
1,HORRIBLE ADAPTATION,"IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG FOR ME TO LIST THE MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS MOVIE [setting, missing scenes, character portrayals, etc.], BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IT IS TRITE AND NOT WORTHY OF BEING CALLED ""JANE AUSTEN'S P & P"". I WENT TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT, BUT LEFT BEFORE THE END BECAUSE IT WAS SO ""untrue"" TO THE NOVEL. AFTER CATCHING IT ON CABLE A FEW WEEKS AGO, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS ""I'M SORRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK IF THIS OSCAR-NOMINATED MOVIE IS ALL THEY HAVE TO GO BY."" THE FIRTH/EHLE VERSION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THIS. IF YOU ARE NOT AN AUSTEN FAN AND/OR HAVE NOT READ THE NOVEL, EITHER READ THE BOOK OR RENT/BUY THE FIRTH/EHLE MOVIE."
3,its growing on me...,"First off, I am an avid lover of the BBC P&P; with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. That being said, when I first watched this movie, I could not help but compare Matthew and Keira to the two actors I loved. I had decidedly hated it before it was even completed!I watched it again and enjoyed it a bit more. The actors who portray Jane and Bingley do a great job. I loved Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet and Dame Judi as Lady Catherine...After a third viewing (thanks to my DVR), I have bought it. I like that I can get the story in 2 hours instead of 6, if I am in a ""hurry"" for some Austen. :) Matthew's Darcy talks a bit to fast for me at some times and Keira's Elizabeth can be a bit wooden, but there are times where their sparks do outshine Colin and Jennifer's. If watched with an open mind, maybe it will grow on you as well."
3,Wonderful movie,I rate the movie 5 stars. It is true the movie doesn't follow the book completely but does any movie? There are very few things that are different in the movie from the book. I just found there were many story lines that were left out completely. This movie focuses more on Mr. Dacy and Lizzie's relationship. I loved the movie. Three stars rating is due to the two disc collector's edition. It is a waste of money. It is two copies of the movie. I don't need two of the same movie. The extras aren't worth the cost. I wouldn't buy this two disc collector's edition. Buy a single video.
1,Very disappointing,"I am an Austen fan and thought that the Colin Firth film gave a great insight into the lives of the characters without overexaggeration or mistakes (except a small majority) but the 2005 was a complete disaster!Kiera Knightly is a brilliant actress but her portrayal of Lizzy Bennet was just lame.As for the costume design, the Bennets were supposed to be in at least the top 10% of the middle class. Yet this film portrayed them as more working class with their cheap looking gowns and ugly home.However, on another matter i thought Mr Darcy was fabulous in appearance yet when he opened his mouth he spoke far too fast for the Darcy we all know.A very disappointing film yet funny in places.I did buy it and it is good to watch if you have a few hours spare but much better to rent from the video store than actually buying it."
2,The is production of P&P falls flat,"Simply put, this production of Pride and Prejudice is just lame. Mr. Bennet has not the wit, nor Darcy the charm, nor Elizabeth the grace of the characters in the book. There is hardly any romantic chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy in this film; the movie relies on skillful editing instead of skillful acting to capture the audience. The brevity of the film and the resulting omission of parts of the original story leave this film flat. A much more charming, captivating, and true-to-the-original (albeit much longer) production is the BBC/A&E production, and I would recommend that one instead."
3,"Good movie, might actually be better in DVD Format","GF says that she really liked the ""misty"", ""steamy"" setting of the movie which I can see. Clarity of blu-ray was understandably sharp and part of the mystique and character or soft lines and a slightly hazy appearance (as seen on most DVD's in comparison to Blu-ray)was lost in the higher quality. Good movie though..."
2,Disappointed,"When I heard that Keira Knightly was going to be Eliza Bennet in P&P I was excited. I did not see it in the theater so I rented it, and was very disappointed. I was already a huge fan of the Firth/Ehle version and I think that the Keira Knightly version was too modern. When Eliza walked into Netherfield with her hair down made me cringe. Women in the 19th century, of her standidng, did not wear their hair like that in public. I also didn't like the fact that Miss Bingly wore dresses w/o sleevs. the ending was good, though highly romanticized. This was the only good thing about this movie. All in all it was OK, but if you want a version that followed the book very closely, go for BBC with Firth and Ehle."
2,Pride & Prejudice (2005),"Very disappointing version of P&P. I felt that the actors were rushed in trying to portray an epic movie and there wasn't the fit seen with the previous actors. The only version that I have seen so far that was by far the most timely and consistent to the book was the BBC A&E 1995 version with Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle. Although one person wrote that the ages of the actors (Firth/Ehle) didn't seem to coincide with the characters due to their maturity, one must remember the time period in which Jane wrote. People were far more mature for their ages then they are today and I felt the two fit the maturity given of the times. Also the other characters just didn't fit right either. Given that movies tend to go long nowadays, they could have spent more time/length in this one."
1,HUH????!!!!!!,"People actually like this ridiculous, sorry version of P&P;?? Some people actually call this an accurate adaptation??Huh.But then again, that's why the work of Britney Spears is called music, and the likes of Paris Hilton are seen as icons, right? And scores of females actually want to be them....Trash. Pathetic lack of knowledge and lack of good sense rule the globe today. Thank you, the trash generator that is Hollywood."
4,Good Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies! I read the book first, and the movie definitely follows the plotline well. I couldn't stop watching until the very end (I cried!)."
2,"Digital copy is from 3rd party,, beware","I was excited to find one of my husband's favorite movies on DVD AND Blu-ray at such a low price. AND I could get a digital copy to boot. Little did I know that you have to wait for delivery of the hard copies to get a ""special code"" to download the digital copy from a 3rd party website that I'm not familiar with. I don't download from unfamiliar websites and have been hesitate. Also, you have to download the movie to your PC, Ipad or Android/Smartphone. I rarely watch movies on these items, takes up too much memory. I watch my downloads from my Roku, which I thought, wrongly, would be where I would download this movie. I was very disappointed with this deception. No where is the buyer made aware of all this. I advice you to just buy the DVD/Blu Ray from where ever and if you want the download, go to your usually familiar site. This is so unlike Amazon. Not happy with this purchase."
4,Romance's convoluted course,"Saw this with my girlfriend. She cried at the end. This is a well made film. There is one breathtaking shot of Keira Knightley's character posed on the edge of a cliff, with a magnificent backdrop. I would love to have a poster sized print of it up on the wall. An excellent stay at home date movie. Very humorous too."
1,Awful. Waste of time.,"Definitely see the BBC version instead.Hated hated hated this version. Too shallow and 21st century anachronistic in appearance and delivery. Hated the lame Sixteen Candles, sitting-on-the-table scene at the end of the movie and the vast majority of everything that came before it. Hated the casual, everything-out emotionalism that characterizes modern times and makes this movie a disaster in its departure from the tone and tenor of Austen's work.Got it as a gift so gritted my teeth through it, watching it with the very thoughtful gifters. Thank you for making me appreciate, even more than ever, the Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle BBC version!"
2,SHYNESS AND GOOFYNESS,"This is the wierdest movie I've ever seen! Mr. Darcy was really shy acting and Lizzy was really goofy. The dad and mom didn't act AT ALL sophisticated. And their house was really gross looking. Also when Mr. Bingly laughs he lookes and sounds really stupid. And when Lizzy laughs when Mr.Bingly, Miss Bingly, and Mr Darcy walk in it's really stupid - I don't know why she laughs then. There's a close up of just Lizzy's eyes and it looks really sickening. It's really really odd that are in there pajama's and meet in the same field. I've listen to the book an tape and movie is not any thing like the book. If you're going to watch this movie take a take antivert before - otherwise you may be sick."
1,If You're a P & P Fan This Isn't Even Worth Renting...,"This was one of the worst interpretations of a classic novel that I've ever seen. If you have seen the Collin Firth - Jennifer Ehle characterizations of Darcy and Elizabeth, you'll probably not even sit through this DVD. The leads of this abbreviated version of Pride and Prejudice are just not believable. Knightley giggles her way through the Elizabeth role and doesn't really seem to understand the character at all. The script is choppy. If you didn't know the real social commentary of the novel you certainly wouldn't get it out of this movie. Don't waste your time!"
1,What happened to Pride and Prejudice?,"I have to be honest, I didn't watch the whole thing -- why take a book that brilliantly portrays the foibles of the leisure class and turn it into a soap opera?This is the third movie made from the book. Two of them are worth watching. This is not one of the two."
4,Great movie,I have always loved this story and even though some people may not like this new version I appreciate how it was done.
5,I would give this movie more than 5 stars...,"This is a beautiful, and some say the most accurate, telling of the Jane Austen novel. The actors are superb - especially Matthew Macfadyen, who perfectly portrays Mr. Darcy with enough frostiness to make him standoffish, yet enough vulnerability to not completely dislike the character. If the acting was not enough to tempt you to watch the movie, try the witty dialogue or the breath-taking English countryside scenery. I really canot recommend this movie enough. It is something that everyone can watch with no one being embarrassed by nudity, sex scenes, violence or vulgar language. A delight from beginning to end. Run right out and buy this movie!! You will want to watch this over and over again."
5,Oh so romantic...,"I for one had never read the book, so I had no expectations regarding the film. Simply put, it was lush, romantic, funny and beautifully shot. Definitely a woman's movie! I have since read the novel and loved every page of it. I must say though that I like the changes they made for the film. It just worked better visually. The soundtrack is lovely too. I love this collector's edition...it reminds me of one of Austen's books. The behind the scenes extras were interesting and brought much understanding to the time and culture as well."
3,Tolerable I suppose,I must admit I was very disapointed when I saw this movie. The BBC tv-series is so much better. So I wouldn't bother with the movie but buy the tv-series instead!
1,Make sure you have a hd dvd player!,"Bummer, I bought this hd dvd thinking I could watch it on my new hd tv, but could not because my dvd player is not hd! So now I have this dvd I cannot use. I re-bought the regular version and of course the story is fantastic, which I already knew."
3,What happened to the end?!,"The last scene in the movie was removed from the DVD!!!! I thought that scene was one of the most important scenes that sets this movie apart and adds to the BBC version in a way all of us who've read the book wish it had. So... if someone knows where I can get the ""uncut"" version, please let me know. Until then I'm not buying this DVD."
5,my favorite movie,this is my favorite move hands down. Such a great period piece using great actors. Keira Knightly is perfect for these types of roles
5,Bewitching and elegant,"This film has bewitched me body and soul. I have now seen it 4 times and I can not wait to see again. The music, costumes, romance, scenery and of course the amazing acting by all the cast. Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful adaptation,"Pride and Prejudice is a favorite novel, and I admit I'm ""prejudiced"" in its favor. But this adaption won my full affection. Keira Knightley turns in an absolutely perfect portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. The rest of the cast is terrific as well, including very nice portrayals by Donald Sutherland and Rosamund Pike.The scene at the dinner table where Elizabeth learns that Mr. Darcy has unexpectedly saved her sister's honor, and the library scene where she tells her father that she truly does love Mr. Darcy are just exquisitely played by Miss Knightley, and I can watch them over and over.A great DVD that I would highly recommend for all Jane Austen fans."
5,My Favorite By Far!,"I found every character, down to the smaller ones perfectly cast.I felt a real affection between all the family members.Donald Sutherland was superb. Keira Knightly showed a dignity without pursing her lips up the the the other Lizzie did.I never cared for the Colin Firth version, cute as he is in it, because they all seemed so prissy and their concerns trivial.These actors brought the story to life for me.And the way the camera moved from room to room, showing the households small activities from the servant singing as she goes up the stairs to the parents in their bed to the girls giggling in their rooms. They employed the same ploy at the ball focausing not only on the leading characters but on small accurances of incidental characters. Brilliant! And the piano work and soundtrack! Magnificent!I've heard some comlain it is too ""Wuthering Heights"" but that is one of my favorites so ... Hooray!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though some of the casting choices seem a bit suspect (Jena Malone is annoying as usual and Donald Sutherland is manifestly American), this is a fine adaptation of the Austen classic and a fine film."
5,Pride and Prejudice Movie,I bought this for my teen-age daughter not sure if she would like it or not. She loved it.Has since read the book and watched the movie several times.
5,Lively and natural,"I love this movie. I admit that I have not read the book yet, and therefore cant judge the authenticity of this movie from that aspect. But as an 'ardent' fan of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehrle miniseries version I was skeptical that I would enjoy this abbreviated one. However, I was so thrilled that the Bennett family are portrayed as such a vibrant and close-knit family with more ""country"" roots than we are shown in that other version. Even their house, shown as less pristine, makes sense for a middle class home in the country. The girls show more of the natural feelings that a young single woman would feel even at that time, or maybe more so since marriage was the goal of their 'occupation'. Even a sensible girl would be giddy over a handsome man. I enjoyed that Mr. Bennett was endeared to all his daughters and even to his wife more in this movie. It was a joy to see this classic love story told from a new angle."
1,Disappointed...,"I was really disappointed with Keira Knightley's performance here. Where's the extreme intelligence of Elizabeth Bennet? She giggled too much and failed to portray the other important aspects of her character.As for the ending, it was just too much. Excessive romanticism for a Jane Austen novel. Pride and Prejudice is not a Harlequin romance."
5,Pride and prejudice,Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightly was an excellent update of the classic. Its interpretation is concise compared to earlier versions but just as powerful if not even more effective in delivering the essence of the love story.
1,Can I rate it as 0 -- ZERO??!!,"I'm a big fan of the book, but I HATE this movie version.I hate every second of this movie. It is NOT Pride and Prejudice. It just simply borrows the title and characters' names from the story, that's all."
1,already a perfect P&P,"A&E did a wonderful version of this, and all I can say is that anyone who loved this never saw the Collin Firth version. Kiera Knightly is not one of my favorite actresses, so I may be biased, but the other Elizabeth, played by Jennifer had a lot more class. Take the time to see the classic, and don't bother with the inferior remake."
4,David Rintoul IS Mr. Darcy,"It has taken two years for me to bring myself to see this movie. On first viewing it, I picked it to pieces and was quite upset, being a purist, but something about it got to me. By the third viewing I had fallen in love with it, much to my surprise. Everyone keeps referring to the BBC version starring Colin Firth, but that is the A&E version, which also took some liberties. The definitive Pride and Prejudice was done by the BBC in 1980 and stars David Rintoul. He IS Mr. Darcy and that version is completely faithful to the book. If you have never seen, you must."
3,Pride & Prejudice,"A good movie, but prefer other Jane Austin's adaptations, eventhough this is one of the most talked about ones. I would not mind seen this movie with a different cast. This is not to put down this cast, but something was missing for me when it related to the chemistry."
4,A good rendition,"Many of Jane Austen's books have been through the process of adaptation from the book to the screen. A personal favorite for Pride and Prejudice is the ministries made by BBC. Of course, many purists will object to the lack of adherence to the book in this particular adaptation however they seem to miss out on one word in the description, ""based."" The movie is BASED on the book. No matter if you've never read Pride and Prejudice in your life and are seeing the film for the first time, or you've read all of Austen's work and own many adaptations that you yourself enjoy, this version is just as charming and profound, odd as those two words sound in a sentence. The imagery and music certainly make up for the lack of certain plot devices and characters. The on-screen chemistry between the lead actors, Keira Knightly and Mathew MacFayden, is dynamic in many scenes.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good romance and learning a lession or two along the way!"
4,Movie new/sealed but not clicked in box,Movie was sent new and sealed but the DVD was not securely clicked in the box and was moving around inside when received. Luckily the DVD was not scratched enough to affect the movie.
5,in love with pride and prejudice,"I have watched this movie at least 115 times, not exagerating, on cable and now i bought it, i can't help myself, even now that i own this movie, when it comes on cable i still have to watch it. My 4 1/2 year old grandbaby says MiMi not again. love it love it love it tammy, granite city, IL"
1,Dreadful!,"I wasn't so sure I'd like this version of the story, since I love the BBC production so much. But despite my reservations, I went ahead and watched it anyway. How I regret that decision. If I could it less than one star, I would. The story was rushed, and not just so they could trim it down to standard feature film length. The characters were portrayed all wrong, and I winced at their delivery on many occasions. The casting was okay, but how Keira Knightley received an Oscar nomination, and a BAFTA award, for this lackluster, uninspired portrayal of Lizzy is beyond me. She was dreadful. The writing was equally as bad, as they cut out many of Austen's original lines and scenes in order to put in their own weaker ideas. The scenery and cinematography were the only good points of the entire film. If you've never read the book, you'd probably enjoy this. If you have, don't bother. Skip it and watch the best adaption: the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."
3,With a story like this how can you go wrong?,"With a great cast and a great story,how can you possibly go wrong? Easy if you don't understand the period in which the story is set. This could have been great with better direction. Try the BBC'S NORTH and SOUTH for a wonderful English period film. It's a masterpiece!!!!!"
3,Not Much Austen Left,"Finally got to see the Keira Knightley version of P&P; on cable. It can't hold a candle to the 1980 version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. [I have not seen the Firth version].The actors in the Knightley film are just that -- actors, playing parts.In the 1980 version, we see Elizabeth, Darcy, Mr Bennet, Mr Collins, Lady Catherine and everyone, as Jane Austen describes them and their actions.This adaption took all of Jane Austen out and left nothing in its stead. Beautiful to look at, but not much else...."
2,Cannot compare with the A&E version,"If you read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, you will agree with me on the fact that this movie sucked. I watched it even though it was painful, and when I got to the end I was completely disappointed with their interpretation of the classic. Keira Knightly failed in portraying Elizabeth as well as many other actors. However, this movie was shorter than the 6 hour A&E version, but I felt as though this movie ruined the true story for those who haven't read the book yet. Huge disappointment."
3,Good acting and a good story makes it enjoyable,"I liked this film but did not lvoe it. I enjoyed the acting from every one espesially Keira Knightley(in her oscar nominated role), and Donald Sutherland who dose great. The film is good and entertaning and is a good time peice movie but at times lack's energy to keep the viewer happy. Overall the film is good to watch once and that's enough and the acting is great to watch."
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie because it showed how sometimes things might not work out how you think they will, but in the end, they do work out. Keira Knightly is absolutely gorgeous and wonderful in this movie. Matthew Macfadyen plays an interesting character with a personality that takes time to warm up to. As the movie heats up, he becomes more lovable and exciting."
4,Well done,"Well done adaptation of the Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". The cinematography and performances are excellent, and the details regarding life in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (manor houses with peeling paint and dirty floors, muddy yards with pigs and chickens about, etc.) give the film a realistic dimension.However, because this is a feature film, it, by necessity, omits much of the story and nuance of the execptional BBC version. However, for those without the time to invest in the longer version, this is a great consolation prize."
3,Not as good as the A&E Series,"This movie, although well made, was a little too liberal with the emotions of the characters. I went in to see the movie feeling that I would not like Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. I didn't think she could pull it off as intelligent and composed Lizzy and I was right! This movie is still watchable since I am big fan of anything of Jane Austen's. Stay away from the movie unless you are a Pride and Prejudice devotee."
1,I was horrified!!!,"First off I will admit that I do not care for Keira Knightley in the first place. But I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and at least watch it.I turned it off with in the first five minutes. I was horrified! I did however sit and watch it all the way through a few weeks later with some friends. (I think they had to tie me down to keep me from leaving) The acting was terrible, the characters were not faithfully presented at all. This is one of my favorite novels and it was butchered! Ms. Knightley did not make a good Elizabeth Bennett, she came off as a silly air head with no wits at all, rather than the smart, witty, prejudiced Lizzy we all love. Mr. Bingley was portrayed as an imbecile who only knew how to laugh and smile. I could go on but I think you see my point. Many key parts were left out of the film. I was very disappointed. I don't see how any Austen fan could enjoy this at all."
2,Pride & Prejudice,"The sound trak on this movie is trouble. You can't hear the actor and actress when they are talking. I love the A&E; movie much better. I put a link to the better one.Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)"
2,Pride and predudice,"I have both the BBC and the current edition of this movie. The current one, nominated for an award of an Oscar, is a travesty of Jane Austen's beautiful novel. Where has the taste and judgement of the movie industry gone? I might suggest that Donald Sutherlin go find a sequel for MASH. Please go look at the earlier edition.John Bowen, M.D."
2,Read the book...,"I did not get into this movie at all. I say read the book instead. Some of the art was good and there was some eye contacts in the movie that made some scenes rather sexy, but other than that, the movie did not do much for me. I had a hard time sitting through it."
4,it was a bit slow,"I really enjoy love/ chick flicks I had never seen this movie before.Always heard this movie was excellent, However, It did not meet my expectations."
5,Beautiful,Beautiful movie. Can watch this over and over. Fast turn around from Amazon. I order all my movies from here.
5,Why must it end?,"I love this movie. I know some may find it a sappy love story, but I love the sarcasm and humor of Austen entwined in the romance to be enchanting. Great for a rainy day. My guilty pleasure."
4,Great Service,"My item came very quick and I used standard ground shipping. It also came packaged very well. I am a new member to Amazon, this was my first purchase, but not my last!"
3,More Special Features...,I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't at least a 2-Disc Special Edition of this movie. The movie is entertaining and gives another depth of the forever told story. It has also brought a lot of fans to Ms. Austen.I've been quite a fan of Jane Austen's books for quite a long time and have gotten to see the most beloved version of this story with Colin Firth. To all of those who have seen this version I strongly recommend that you try not to compare MacFadyen to Firth (I mean how can you?). And take it for its own interpretation of the book. (Although I was bit mad that they left out certain characters.) But all in all I'd recommend this movie.
2,Pride & Prejudice DVD,"I gave this as a gift for christmas, but it also bring fond memories for my daughter, for ther 19 birthday we went to the play-Pride and Prejudice at our local theatre. It's a great movie, and she glad to have it in her collection of DVDs."
1,Need to warn will not play in dvd,Very disappointed this will not play in dvd. A different type of player is required. This was a waste of time and money.
4,"Good, but with some reservations..","If I hadn't been spolied by just discovering the 1995 BBC TV version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, I would have called the movie great, so I admit I'm spoiled. That said, the MI-5 star as Darcy actually worked well, as did lovely Keira Knightley. If you haven't seen either version, watch this one FIRST!.All said, if it had not been for the casting of Donald Sutherland as the father, I think this would have been an even better movie than it already is."
2,Pride & Prejudice without Austen's verbal exchanges,"Austen's novel is based on sharp observations on human nature. In particular, Elisabeth's attraction to the opposite sex is not so much her beauty but the beauty of thought and the ability to engage others with witty verbal exchanges. The fast and intense fireworks between Elisabeth and Darcy have been partially destroyed by the film's script, which assume movie viewers cannot understand or follow their long verbal duels. It is sad how the new script have cut or shortened these exchanges. The music and the scenary tries to compensate for its loss but the result is never fully satisfying!"
2,"I'm a purist, I guess.","I could have dealt with a giggly Elizabeth (though it was hard). I could have handled the romance novel ending, but for me, it was the changing of Jane Austen's words -- in particular the romantic words of Mr. Darcy. What screenplay writer could possibly think they could improve on Ms. Austen's words after a few centuries? It's unfathomable. If you're not a huge fan of the book, or the BBC version, this is a fine rendition. But truly, I think you'll wonder what all the hype is about on the book after just seeing this version.There's a lot of book to be condensed in two hours, so I will give them credit for that -- but if you're going to change the book, do it with style -- like the BBC did with Colin Firth diving into the pond on his visit back to Pemberley. There's a change I can live with."
5,westonjm,"I have seen this version and the much lauded 1995 version, and in my opinion I find this to be the best version. Keira Knightley turns in her best film performance here! The supporting cast is excellent, and the settings sumptuous. I enjoyed the 1995 version, but this version is flawless!!!"
4,Loved it!,"Yes, I know that it doesn't conform to the book as much as we would like, but this movie is still highly entertaining and captures the spirit of the novel. I think the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy is well acted by Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen (especially him). I LOVE the way Macfadyen plays Darcy. Also, Judy Dench is brilliant (as always) as Lady Catherine. She's SO much better than the actress who played Lady Catherine in the BBC version.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that I've watched about 5 times so far."
4,Great teen movie,My fourteen year old daughter loves this movie. The acting is good and music is beautiful! I bought her the sheet music for her piano also.
1,"Inaccurate, Depressing & Bad Acting!","In 1 word, Inaccurate ~ they did NOT have Pigs running in and out of thier house! The Bennett family wanted to be upper-class and would have died before they had live stock running through their home! This is 100% Inaccurate/Unfaithful to the novel Jane Austen wrote. 30-40 minutes into the movie, I turned it off... Not to mention the colors they used in this movie - BLEGH! Greys, Browns, Whites and Blacks ~ it makes everything look dirty and even dirtier. Which is also why, I HATE this version. And don't even get me started on the acting ~ it's just as bad. I made the mistake buying it without having seen it first, a mistake I will never repeat. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS VERSION AGAIN - EVER!"
3,not impressed much,"Ok I admit I've never read the novel but.......... This video seemed over-edited. It was hard to follow the actual story behind all the glitzy visual grandeur. The audio kept going up & down, depending on when the director wanted you to know ""hey, wake up, this is an important, emotional scene"". Donald Sutherland was catatonic..you call that acting???"
2,Nonsense,"I don't think any person who participated in the making of this movie has ever read the novel.I like Keira Knightley as an actress, but her portrayal of Eliza was too wild. Although Eliza is spirited, I feel that in this movie her character went from spirited to blatantly rude.The Bennett's lived like paupers in this movie, which was not so. They were not rich, but they were not poor either. The girls seemed unkept in this movie.And as many others have pointed out, many of the historical societal behaviors were disregarded.And why was Bingley portrayed to be intellectually incompetent? Nowhere in the book is it suggested and completely ruined the movie for me.I also believe that after seeing the Firth and Ehle version, that followed the novel so meticulously, I may be biased."
1,Keira's performance as Lizzie Bennet is deficient,"One of the most wonderful things about the character of Lizzie Bennet is her superb wit and intelligence. I couldn't find any in Keira's portrayal. With so much inane giggling going on, I wondered as to what made her Elizabeth so appealing to Mr Darcy with so many other girls falling at his feet with the same temperament and character. It was very disappointing."
3,Scratched DVD ... Again!,This is the second DVD and both are scratched! I sent the first one back and now I have to send this one too!
1,Utterly horrid!,"Absolutely NO humor. I can't be Jane Austen without her wit. This film lacked any chemistry at all between the family and that is the foundation upon which an Austen novel is built. Lizzie & Jane barely spoke, the father (played by Sutherland) was dull and lackluster. Keira Knightly's hair was absolutely ugly with those always wet-looking bangs. It was a ghastly take on Pride & Prejudice. The scenery was gratuitous, there were contrived silences that only interrupted the cadence of the plot, and there was just nothing to write home about in this film.Keira Knightly's portrayel of Lizzie Bennet was too strong, that jutting chin and too-fighting glance was all wrong for the character. Lizzie has more grace, tact, class, and love for her family. YUCK!"
1,Bland and Boring,I was SO glad I didn't see this dreadful movie in the cinemas. I don't understand is why on earth anyone would try to improve on an already masterful adaptation (even with it's flaws) of this beloved novel. The A & E version is the very best do date.Keira Knightly was about as believable as I would be in this role. Her acting is stiff and her facial features (what is up with her mouth?) are too distracting. Matthew Macfadyen is so wooden and doesn't betray any feeling towards Knightly. There isn't any real tension or chemistry between them.You can skip this movie.
1,Do not recommend,"While it would be tough for any adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to stand up to the quality of the BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this production does not even come close. The quality of the casting and the liberties taken with the story line made it difficult for me to even stay to see the end of the movie. Very disappointing!"
3,Okay,This version is okay but not great; too short to do it justice. Great romance movie if you aren't familiar with the book.
2,Movies just don't compare to books.,"This movie was certainly an adaptation. The characters were not as I envisioned in my head when I read Jane Austen's novel. I think that because so much was cut it was hard to see how characters developed so quickly. Some of the actors were downright obnoxious. I have not seen the A&E version yet but I think I would have preferreed it over this one. Although this review seems harsh, I think it is a decent movie for someone who has not read the book first. I wish I rented this instead of buying it."
1,Pride and Prejudice,This adaptation is quite disappointing. I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and this version is so drab and the actor's portrayals are unconvincing and boring.The A&E; version with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle is far superior.
1,disappointed,After seeing the BBC version I was very disappointed. Mostly I was disappointed in Keira's performance. It was more or less reciting out of a book than actually becoming Elizabeth and truly acting. She holds no candle to Jennifer Ehle.
5,Most Romantic Movie!,"I know many of you are fans of the BBC version and I liked it too. And although this remake had its flaws (acting, costuming, some details incorrect), there is one thing that this remake had that, in my opinion, BBC lacked - emotion. By the end of the movie, I felt that these characters were in love, I felt that Jane was truly happy after her proposal. I didn't feel any of that during the BBC version. The story here may not have been told as thoroughly as other versions of this story, but I thought it was told better."
4,Good movie. Not wonderful like the A&E version though.,"I was slightly disappointed with the new Pride and Prejudice. I thought it was a good movie, but definitely does not compare to the A&E version. I guess it's hard to squeeze all those details into a 2 hour movie. It's definitely a good movie to watch if you have never seen the older versions of Pride and Prejudice. The one thing I really liked was the ending. That was very sweet and romantic. I rewinded that part several times! SIGH!!"
1,Crap compared to BBC version..,I thought this was going to be even better than the BBC version (which I love) it was horrible!!!! I was speechless at the end .. and not in the good way! They left so many parts out and what was most annoying was the literally hated each other and the next minute they were madly in love ( I can only guess due to time constraints?) it was painful to watch. BBC's Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle cannot be topped.
1,Am I the only one who think Knightley can't act?,"Keira Knightley butchered what could have been a refreshing adaption to a beautiful story. Knightley appears oblivious to whom her character is. Again her constant posing and trying to be sexy by hanging her mouth open, is distracting and obnoxious.And, once again, it falls to the other actors to carry her and fill in the gaps in her performance.I dont' know what her agent had to pull to get her this role, but it's a waste of time, talent, and money. Only a miracle worker like Johnny Depp can cover for her like he did in ""Pirates""."
3,ok-sound a huge problem,"If you're interested in the what the actors are saying- try a different format than this streaming site. The video quality is grainy, but tolerable. The audio quality is less than acceptable- won't use Amazon again unless it is for something where sound is not an issue."
5,love this movie!,"one of my favorite movies, totally dont regret buying it! :) The acting is great and not over the top, very appropriate for all ages."
2,destroyed the classic,"I have read this classic Jane Austen story so many times. I have seen so many versions of this classic. But, when I saw this version, I was appalled. The interpretation was modernized and failed in its attempt to remake an adaptation; it proved to be disastrous. First, the setting for the Bennet home depicted them as extremely vulgar. Second, Darcy appeared weak and stupid. Third, the screenwriters completely changed the storyline thus it was not an adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, but a distasteful, unresearched film about a silly girl in a messed up fantasy world that did not depict the 1800's in our world and then a weak and confused, immature male that falls in love with her. It was disgusting."
2,disappointed,"I didn't like this version. I think Keira Knightly is a great actress but she's a little bit too assertive and aggressive for this role. In my opinion, this is a little too Holywood. Most of the women in this version lack a sense of inner peace from the Victorian time."
5,Pride and Prejudice,"The acting was suburb. The costumes and scenery were wonderful. Let's face it, I LOVE English drama and try to view all things English. Waiting for the 3rd season of Downton Abby."
1,awful,"A truly awful version of a wonderful novel, that clings to thenotion (from the 80's maybe) that gritty is good.I think it would leave Miss Austen amused, bored, maybea little disgusted. I'm sorry, too, because I'm afraid a lotof people will get their idea of the sublime Pride and Prejudice fromthis oh so pedestrian, somewhat nasty movie.Ick!"
2,"Entertaining, but...","I'm NOT by any means an Austen purist, but really! Turning the Bennet home into a hovel, where huge pigs roam freely and laundry suffocates the yard, and an unkempt, filthy-looking Mr. Bennet is perhaps a misguided attempt to make Darcy look far, far superior to Elizabeth, and makes his descent to her level perhaps more accessible to those who don't read and don't have an understanding of the time. Yikes. There were parts I enjoyed, and I liked Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy. Kiera Knightly is very one-note as an actress, don't like her. Very unsatisifying."
3,Grittier rendition,"I have to state that I didn't really understand why there was another adaptation of P&P; done so soon after the magnificant A&E;/BBC series with Firth and Ehle. I have so much loved that version that I watched this determined not to like it. I didn't hate it but compated to Firth and Ehle (and the entire cast of that version) I just couldn't reach the same appreciation for the newer version. It probably isn't fair to compare the cast of this one to the other.I did feel that probably this version was more historically accurate with the depiction of the Bennet house and the village...much more drab and rustic. Piles of manure on the roads and paths, sloppier animal pens etc. But it did not make for more pleasurable viewing.Perhaps if I'd never seen the A&E;/BBC version, I might have appreciated this one more."
3,"Great movie, not a very good blu-ray though",I bought this for my wife who loves the movie and has been waiting for it to come out on blu-ray. Her wait was not rewarding though. The blu-ray quality is disappointing.
1,Not Pride and Prejudice,"Wow, what can I say that hasn't already been said by so many disappointed viewers. Knightly plays Lizzy like some rude, self-absorbed teenager. I think a majority of the people that loved this movie must be under the age of 21 or something (Note that I said a majority and not all). This is really nothing like the real Pride and Prejudice--why did the director even bother--just to make a name for himself by directing a classic in his own stylized way? Wow, I am still in shock at the liberties the screewriter and director took with this novel--it's really quite awful! Please read the book before you defend this film as being an accurate adaptation of P&P!"
5,Inspirational,"I have never seen a more well done movie... when you watch it you feel as if you were living among the Bennet family. Amazing vocabulary, amazing actors and actresses, and amazing scenes. A great family movie!!! I bought this movie the moment it was released. I have watched it several times since them, I think it will be a timeless classic! I highly recommend that you buy this movie, you won't regret it."
3,Fast Forward,"This seemed like the fast forward version of the Pride and Prejudice story compared to the BBC's earlier version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The lead actors in this version, though unquestionably attractive, lacked the depth of character known to the novel's ardent fans. I know Mr. Darcy is a snob, but Matthew Macfadyen never cracks a smile. It just felt like the story flew by with the actors running through their lines like they had to get somewhere fast; a directorial flaw I'm sure. On the other hand, Mr. Bennett's poorly articulated lines were impossible to understand without subtitles.I don't regret buying it at the $9.99 price just to have enjoyed the last scene, which, to give credit where it's due, and though a bit sugary, was more romantic than the BBC version. We wait ardently for Mr. Darcy to finally kiss his Elizabeth, and the BBC version left me longing for a more passionate visual effect. This one had a little more magic."
1,"Movie is great, quality of this DVD version is HORRIBLE!!!","Ok I hope it does not make anyone mad that I am reviewing this with stars so low because I love this version of Pride and Prejudice, it was the first one I saw and I like it even better than the longer one I eventually saw. So I bought this to watch with my daughters the sound is HORRIBLE I had the volume as high as it would go up on my new flat screen and playing in my new dvd/blue ray player up as high as 67 (I think that was as high as it went) and still I wish I could have turned it up. Picture was grainy worse than watching this on instant streaming on my wireless.. SO disappointed in the quality of this recording and wish I would have bought a used blue ray instead. Save your money and buy a better quality recording.. Unless your watching this on an old tv and your not used to crystal clear HD. I don't know how the sound would be."
1,"Beware of ""BD-Live"" previews","I sat down to watch this movie tonight and was blindsided by an obnoxious marketing gimmick called BD-Live. The DVD automatically downloaded a preview of ""Get Him To The Greek"" from the internet and started playing it. There was no option to access the DVD menu or skip the preview. What does a raunchy comedy about rock music have to do with ""Pride & Prejudice""? Why is this DVD downloading software to my computer without my permission?I purchased this movie on SD DVD years ago and I looked forward to enjoying the better picture and sound quality of Blu-ray. Since I can't find any way to disable BD-Live in my Windows Media Center preferences I am returning the Blu-ray copy of ""Pride & Prejudice"" as defective merchandise."
1,Simply dreadful!,"There is no point in trying to list all of the flaws in this adaptation of Austen's classic; I would be here all day! What possessed the makers of this film to cast Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet, or Donald Sutherland as her father? Knightly's Lizzy is a giggling and immature airhead, with no depth of character whatsoever. The language and behaviour of the time is ignored, the dialogue is very clumsy, and the costumes and general appearance of the characters are shabby. Macfadyen's Darcy looked as bored as I was. Did the scriptwriters read the book before setting about writing the script? Was any historical research done? I doubt both. There isn't a scene in the entire film that I can say a good thing about. So badly done. So disappointing."
3,Just not quite there,"While the A&E; version is delighfully over the top, this P&P; is darkly under the top. The main characters are too sweaty, too poor, and too coarse. I often wasn't sure if I was looking at servants or the gentry. Although historically accurate, dirt and sweat are more of a Dickens theme than an Austen. They don't accentuate the story, just make it more improbable.Jane looked the part, the mother was an interesting interpretation of the character, the father bordered on senility, Lizzy came across as an average girl and Darcy had deadpan eyes that made me as bored watching him as he seemed to be with his part.If the A&E; and this version of P&P; were put on opposite ends of a spectrum, the ideal would be somewhere in between. As it stands, watch the A&E; if you can spare the time and turn off this one after Darcy proposes and Lizzy accepts."
1,A travesty!,"This is a completely ridiculous retelling of the classic story. Stick with the BBC version; you'll be much happier. Knightly's Elizabeth Bennett is totally unbelievable, and the Darcy is even less so. The shortened version of the story is totally unacceptable!"
1,This movie gave me a migraine.....,"Painful! I enjoyed the book and the BBC version, so I assumed this adaptation would be tolerable. Don't waste your time on this crap."
1,Blasphemous,"Don't waste your time with this nonsense. The story is altered to the extent that none of the characters' actions make sense, none of the original ideals are portrayed, and no understanding of the novel's intent is achieved. The A&E production was of such high quality that I easily recommend it to those who don't wish to read the book; there's simply no improving on that one, and this piece of trash should be forgotten by the movie-going public."
3,"Wonderful book, good adaptation","Still prefer the Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier version, but this was good. Wish closed caption was available, since I found some of the dialogue difficult to understand."
4,"Very well made, and very good casts","Compared to the Colin Firth Jennifer Ehle version, this movie has better casting and better camera work. The problem is, of course, the duration. They try to fit into a 2 hour movie, and it just won't work. It doesn't capture the subtlety of many events, and the character building is ignored. However, if you haven't watched any other versions,you will love this one. I definitely love the casts, as they are more real, the age of the actors match the book, and Matthew McFadyen is a better cast for Darcy than Colin."
5,Another great P & P,I love anything having to do with P & P. I have seen every version. I love the way Knightly plays Elizabeth.
5,Beautiful movie!,"I don't know how many times one of my daughters and I have seen this movie! We really enjoy it. Yes the romance, chivalry, the costumes, the customs, etc are really enjoyed!If you're in to romance, this is the movie to get!"
5,Great Movie,"It is an excellent abridged version of the classic Jane Austin book. The filming is very well done, and the acting is good. If you like Jane Austin's books you will love this movie."
2,Don't blink,"It was just too youngly Hollywood. I understand that to make this into a big screen picture, they had to take a much longer work and condense it into a 2 hour and change length movie. Wow, did the story line fly. And it was a shame that the characters weren't developed more, particularly Mr. Bennet. They had Mr. Bennet mumbling through most of the movie. Mr. Darcy seemed sulky, not snobby. I also think Keira Knightly really tried too hard on her accent (and she's English!).What happened to the Hursts? What was up with the Bennet's house - did anyone else notice that it looked really run down and messy? Did the set hairdresser quit? And the clothes - the styles seemed inconsistient.I admit, I have seen the A&E; version (and hold it as the standard). If you want to see an adaptation of P&P; that is made my people who truly loved the book, rent the A&E; version. The characters are so much better developed, and they really picked excellent actors who really fit the role."
1,Greatly Overrated,"I probably would have enjoyed this presentation of Pride and Prejudice if I hadn't first seen the ""Special Edition"" starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I couldn't help but compare the two films as I was watching this one, and the Knightley/Macfadyen film was inferior in every respect. I was so disgusted, after all the hype surrounding this film, that I almost turned it off at several points, but I decided to see it through just once. If you must see this film, rent it (I wish I had). Buy the Special Edition."
1,Bad mistake,"This movie was like watching a bunch of self impressed fools telling us that a quickie was much better than the real thing. The heart of the story is that the relationship sneaks up on both parties and yet here we have Elizabeth looking and behaving like a weekend slattern. This is an uncomfortable mix of American and English cultures, like a gay man in a marriage, I'm sure they tried hard but completely missed the mark."
1,Ghastly. Awful. Like viewing a corpse of Pride & Prejudice.,"I made the mistake of paying two bucks to rent this. I don't know how anyone could give it more than 1 star, or how Knightly got an Oscar nomination. This was miserably miscast, misdirected, and poorly acted.The script follows the novel only loosely, omitting so much of the story that I doubt someone unfamiliar with P & P would even know what is going on. Instead of showing the Bennets as gentlepeople, this version has them living in a farmyard with a pig wandering into the house. The historical detail is a mess, too. This film has Darcy proposing to Elizabeth at dawn in a field with both of them in their pajamas.A real travesty of one of the finest novels in the English language."
1,Did ANYONE read the book?????,I cannot believe this picture! I have read the book 3 times and it no more reflects what Jane Austen wrote than fly! There are only a VERY few places in this film that even used lines from the book. Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth follows the book just as close as it possibly can. My only fault with that picture is that it stopped with the wedding. Jane Austen had quite a few things to say after the wedding regarding all the characters in the book which wrapped it up nicely. Read it!P.S. I can't believe Dame Judy Dench lent herself to this film.
1,"No Character building, no Emotion and no Romance!","How can anyone even compare this to the BBC version? The characters were not developed, Darcy's heartfelt first proposal to Elizabeth sounded like he was rattling off his shopping list for the day, totally void of the inner conflict you feel in him in the BBC version. Please, don't be duped and sucked in to this two-hour mockery of this beautiful story. Order the BBC version and actually travel back in time and yes, it will take some time, but it is soooooo worth it. This is a must have for your DVD library. Colin Firth is the only Darcy I could ever imagine in this role. It's like someone else trying to play Rhet Butler, it just can't be done."
1,Purely Awful,"This movie was raved by so many critics that I am at a loss as to what they see in it. The movie works only if the viewer knows nothing about Jane Austen, has never seen the BBC classicc (I highly, highly, recommend this), and likes Keira Knightley. She's not an awful actress, but she is so entirely wrong for Elizabeth Bennet that I cringed through the entire movie. Her Oscar nod in unexplainable"
2,Victorian,"While Kira Knightly exceaded my expectations, the film was, to its core, unfaithful to the victorian society that Jane Auston wrote about and critiqued. Jane Austen, i would argue, did not write romance novels so much as commentaries on the world around her. This film was not at all faithful to that society. A young woman would NEVER go about in the dark in her night gown and coat. She would NEVER kiss a man before they were married. Yes she was an upstart and a spit fire... but these basic diversions from societal norms were not Elizabeths... they were a product of modern romantic folly."
4,"A modern, stylish, classic revival - not BBC version worthy but lovely nevertheless!","This modern-day version has an aesthetically pleasing cast and set although it does not stay true to the book. So if you are a fan of Ms. Austen, watch the BBC version; otherwise, you will be disappointed. However, if you are in the mood for a chick flick period piece or love fluff (think Marie Antoinette costumes, decor, etc), you'll enjoy it. Plus, anyone who has every been to the UK or loves its scenery will just be delighted in this modern version!"
1,review,"I've tried and tried to find something redeeming about this movie. I'll admit that I've never thought highly of Keira Knightley. This piece of hollywood crap only made me hate her more. It seemed like every five minutes she was giggling and for what? She portrayed Elizabeth Bennet as nothing more than a giggling school girl and not strong mature woman. Yes, I realize that movies are always going to change things when they are adapting the book into a movie. Yet, I'd rather watch the 1995 masterpiece because of its accuracy."
5,I love and love and love this movie,I can't wait for this to come out on DVD. The performaces by Keira and Matthew are wonderful. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are truly the best couple of literature. :)
1,disaster,"this version of the great austin novel is an absolute disaster; one star rating is too much, i wish i could give it less; it could possibly be considered as a very bad parody on pride and prejudice;worst of all were keira knightley's scary grins and mr bingley's clown face; the rest of the cast was just plain bad; i even felt sorry to see judi dench appear in such a bad movie;everything was wrong in it; really unwatchable!"
1,How to make a bad version of one of the best novels ever written,"Anyone who has read the book or seen the 1995 tv adaptation of Pride and Predjudice should not bother with this. Some of the central characters in the story are given about 5 minutes screen time, the costumes were totally wrong and the ending was totally stupid. My advice to those who haven't bought this yet - use your money for the book or the 1995 tv adaptation instead."
5,VERY ROMANTIC!,I have read Pride and Prejudice. I have seen the BBC version. I don't believe this movie is truly either. This movie takes Jane Austen's book and runs with it. I'm a huge fan of Austen (I have all of her novels) but I do believe that most (the exception being perhaps Persuasion) lack passion. I believe that if Jane Austen were alive to see both versions BBC and this one--I think she would like seeing her book on tv (BBC is practically exact)and fall in love with the 2005 remake.
3,Not too bad...,"The costuming was terrible in this adaptation. They looked so frumpy a lot of the times. I didn't like that. Kiera Knightley was good, but I especially liked the actress who portrayed Jane. She did a far superior job than the Jane in the BBC miniseries. She looked the part too. I wish that she had played Jane in the BBC miniseries, then the masterpiece would have been complete. I didn't like how they portrayed Mrs. Bennett as a drunkard and Mr. Bennett so seriously, not showing the sense of humor he obviously had in the book. Donald Sutherland was the wrong choice of all actors in the movie. But overall, it was fun to watch."
1,A Great Performance - a Poor Film,"Keira Knightley's fine performance cannot save this poor representation of the great book by Jane Austin. The visual presentation of the Bennet home was shocking. Rather than a gentleman of moderate means we see a household where the family walks through the chickens' habitat to enter the back door, the hog is led by the open kitchen door - it's a mess. Mrs. Bennet is represented as a sometimes drunken slob instead of the proper wife, light in intelligence, seeking to fulfill her primary duty - getting 5 daughters, with little dowry, married. There is no attempt to portray the close relationship of sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. In fact, the relationship is cast as that between sisters Eleanor and Mary Ann in ""Sense and Sensibility"". It was a terrible disappointment in nearly every respect. Buy the version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle - it's a treasure whose length gives hours of pleasure."
3,This Story has seen better days,"I wanted to like this version of Pride and Prejudice. The actor playing Mr. Darcy did ok, but Keira Knightly just couldn't portray the sarcastic humor and self-deprecation of Miss Elizabeth Bentley. The footage of the landscapes, houses, etc... was breathtaking but couldn't quite make up for it's other flaws.Keira Knightly is just too pretty and happy for this role. She would have made a better Kitty or Lydia."
2,Skip this -- Stick with A&E's Version,"The screen play pales in comparison with the book, A&E's version, the BBC's version and any other version I've seen. The casting is also largely inferior -- particularly when it comes to Mr. Bennet and D'Arcy. There is just no chemistry here. Save your money and buy the A&E version!"
1,horrendous,"This movie slaughtered a beautiful book. Keira Knightly resembled nothing close to an Elizabeth Bennet and the story was so rushed and sugar coated that only someone who has never read the book, or even heard the plot, could have enjoyed it. It was an absolute heartbreak."
5,My all time favorite movie!,"Love this movie so much! I've seen it so many times, and I never tire of it. Excellet acting, music, funny, romantic, beautiful scenery. Excellent love story! I just cannot say how much I adore this movie!!!"
3,Pride and Prejudice,"This version is good, but I still prefer the BBC series from the 90's. It's about 5 hours in length and just very well acted. There were some good points to this movie, but it was a little too hollywood."
4,"Great Movie, but too short!","This is the very first time, a movie, bring me so many times to a theater!and after i purchased the DVD, i watched it for more than 100 times more...young spirited Keira as Lizzy is very nice,and McFadyen as snobbish Mr. Darcy is totally wonderful,and really handsome too!I watched the Collin ehle version with BBC,what i really enjoy with the bbc version is because it's a mini series,more than 3 hours long in duration, so i really enjoyed the movie flows..the only reason i give this movie P&P; 2005 as 4 stars,is because its too short,..if only they can make it 3 hours at least...i'll give it 100 stars...anyway, it is a really really must have movie!"
4,Great Modern Period Piece,"I loved this movie. I had never been exposed to the story of Pride & Prejudice before watching this movie, so it was a welcome surprise. Sure, I remember when the movie came out and I had no desire to see it because I thought it was a boring, stuffy old british film like the others. Fortunately, I was wrong! This movie is very modern for being a period piece. There is never a moment when you're taken out of the movie through boredom. Highly recommended!"
5,Why this production is great...,"The actors cast as the Bennet family, of course! Keira Knightley is wonderfully watchable and Jena Malone has been around forever; Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan(!) and Talulah Riley have gone on to do some great things! Stately Donald Sutherland always delivers and Brenda Blethyn's flibbertigibbet flightiness is perfect as the feckless matriarch."
4,"Don't compare it to the others, and it's good","I put off seeing this movie until just recently...I enjoy the BBC versions too much. How can a 2 hour movie possibly capture the wonder of this book? Well, it can and it can't. I enjoyed it as simply another adaption of this Jane Austen classic. It wasn't better than the BBC versions, but on its own merit, it was good. Keira Knightley makes a GREAT Elizabeth Bennett, and Darcy is a bit more sympathetic and soft than the other Darcys. I was also turned off by the ""sexy"" reviews, but I wouldn't have used those words. There was chemistry...that's how I'd describe it. I didn't understand the scene with the statues and their nudity...what was the point? And there were other liberties taken. But if you want a quick P & P fix, it was pretty good."
4,Worth Purchasing,"Very good adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, showing some feminist bias against an original Austin reading (ie. Lizzy telling Jane about Wickham settling for less that ten thousand per year rather then Mr Bennett).The HD-DVD is well worth having over the regular DVD (I have both). I'd rate the transfer as 90% as some scenes aren't quite perfect. It did remind my wife as to why we moved from England as the transfer shows the uneven workmanship and daily grime that is so English.Recommended."
5,Awesome,"Awesome. A very very cool story . The movie is extremely well done. The message is very wholesome and kid friendly. No violence, no foul language, no sensuality. Timeless story. All the acting is world class. Pretty true to the book. And agian, a very hopeful and edifying movie about contirition, bearing with one another, devotion, and family values. I would watch it a million times and would even watch it without my wife."
5,Pride & Prejudice,I had always heard wonderful things about this movie. I finally got around to watching it on Amazon streaming. I loved the movie and will watch it again.
5,Age 13...Delightfully romantic.,"Personally, when I read the book, I thought that it would be just a bit fancier. But after the movie came out, it was completely true. Everything in Elizabeth's time and age was not perfect. She wasn't rich, like many people and so why would everything be silk and satin? There is refreshing reality to this film that takes you back in time. The literature was supreme and true to it's era. It followed the book MOST of the way through and I do admit it would be a bit hard to understand had you not read the book first but it quoted lines from Jane Austen's novel and all in all was a very wonderful movie. Bound to be a classic in a decade or two! I know that it's one of MY three favorites!"
1,Didn't like it,I am a Kiera Knightly fan. I did not care for this movie at all. It took me 3 times to watch the entire movie. Watch the BBC version instead.
5,FANTASTIC,"For those of you who are avid Jane Austen fans, this a is a refreshing recent adaptation of the novel. I would recommend anyone who owns the A&E version to also buy this one, as it offers a different take, but one that is equal in value and quality. Also, this one is several hours shorter, so it offers the same great punch in a smaller dose. The actors do a fabulous job, and the cinematography is breathtaking."
3,"If you're a true Austen fan, you may find this movie odd","Beautifully shot, this is an enjoyable movie, although true Austen fans may find it outragous sometimes. For instance, the custumes for the Bennetts look very shabby; the interior of the Bennett's house looks like a French country house; the first dance scene (when Darcy shows up) is very country-side like (are these people really gentlemen and ladies, I almost wondered out loud) ......But overall, I still enjoyed watching it multiple times. You have to remember this is a Hollywood rendition of a much loved story. Don't be offended by its lack of authenticity."
5,love the movie,"The picture and sound quality is great. I love the story, and would recommend this to anyone who likes Pride and Prejudice and would like a copy on blu ray."
4,My 3rd favorite P&P!,"This is good, directed more for today's audience but still enjoyable. I don't like that several parts of the book are missing-but that's creativity for you. Acting is fine. My favorites and truer to the book are the BBC versions from the 80's and 90's. (David Rintoul and Colin Firth playing Darcy)."
1,Pride & Prejudice,I fould that the parts from the book were to speedy so that they could put things in it that arnt in the book at all. Im really sorry I got the movie before seeing it.
1,Not really widescreen...,I love this movie (and give the movie itself 5 stars) but this is a chopped off version and loses a lot of the beautiful images when played on a computer. This widescreen is actually the fullscreen version with the top and bottom cut off. Compare the fullscreen and widescreen versions (I have both) and you will see this. What a shame that there is no way to re-experience the beauty of this film as it was shown in the theatres.
4,Very well done,"I thought this movie was great. Great acting, great costumes. Did Mr. Darcy ever smile?"
3,Pretty but Wrong Context,"Beautiful movie but more reminiscent of the Romantic era versus Regency England. More Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester or Catherine and Heathcliff than Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. And I would have preferred that they left off the ""kissing"" ending that Americans saw in theatres and on the DVD. In Britain they left it out because people started laughing in the theatres and I must admit that I had to stiffle a giggle myself."
1,The Worst Adaptation of Austen EVER!!,"Having read the praises of some of the earlier reviewers, I had to add my two cents. This is the fourth version of the Jane Austen classic that I have seen and this one is the worst version. None of the actors were even competent in pulling off their roles, the screenplay was not at all faithful to Ms Austen's fine dialogue, the direction was lackluster and the art direction left a lot to be desired. Even the the 1940 version with its MGM/Hollywood treatment surpasses this atrocity. I was glad to have the thing over with in the end. What a waste of Judi Dench...."
2,Don't Bother with this version if you've seen BBC's...,"okay, I tried, REALLY tried to like this version... but, I couldn't... not that it wasn't good, it is just that I've been spoiled by the BBC version.... the one with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth... but also, the acting wasn't nearly as good... the leading lady did a very good job, but, the others were quite bad...Darcy - very wooden, not likeable at allThe Mother - annoying, not amusing...The Father - usually, I like Donald Southerland, but, in this picture, he looked like he had to go to the bathroom the entire time.Jane - seemed confusedthe ONLY plus in this version was Wickhim... he was actually handsome in this version..."
1,Worst version I've ever seen,"I love this story, but I have never seen it so badly portrayed. Over half the dialogue was left out, and with it much of the plot. If I hadn't known the story so well, I wouldn't have known what was going on half the time. There was almost no character development, and all the wonderful wit and dry humor was either left out or played completely deadpan, as if either the director or the actors didn't understand what was being said.Don't waste your time with this one -- get the BBC or PBS versions instead. Both were far superior."
1,Was dissapointed,"Great cinematography! Kiera Knightly did a poor job as Elizabeth, she swaggered about in her tomboyish fashion like she was still on board the Black Pearl. Donald Sutherland was wonderful but the movie over all fell flat. The script touched some points in the book but few of the important points. Matthew Mc Fayden was far from the proud arrogant Darcy and came across as a petulant child. His lines were rushed and devoid of emotion. This could have been a great sucess."
1,Not up to snuff,"Sorry, this version didn't cut it for me. I guess I have been spoiled by too many BBC versions of Jane Austen's work. Neither actor was as convincing as Darcy and Elizabeth as Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."
2,Disapointing,"I love Jane Austen. I hate when her books are done on film and they are not true to the orginal story. This film version left a lot to be desired. Kierra Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett? I don't think so. The BBC has a great version of this story on DVD (Collin Firth as Darcy) and it is many times over better than this. I may be a purist but if you are going to tell a story, try to stick to the book it is based on and don't cut corners to try to appeal to the those who don't even know who Jane Austen is."
5,After watching it several times...,"I have grown to love this movie! I initially gave it 3 stars because I felt it was too long and a bit boring. A year later I watched it again and I liked it better than the first time. A year after that and I love it. I have watched it so many times now that even though I have the DVD I watch it on cable when its on.The cinematography is fantastic, as is the costuming. The actors are not just amazing to look at they really embody the characters.If you didn't like it the first time, try watching it again after a time...your opinion may change as mine did!"
2,Not Like The Old Goodies,"At first when I saw this movie I really liked it, and it got me interested in seeing the old one with Colin Firth in it, after watching the old one I can honestly say I cant veiw this one the same as before, mostley because Kiera Knightley and the other actresses really seem awkward in their roles. How ever I will give credit to MR. Darcy, I thought he was quite good in this, and also I give credit to the fact there is only one profanity, and no secular cont."
5,Love It - Love It,This is one of my favorite movies. Have watched it at least 10 times. Could watch is over and over. If you are looking for something romantic - you have found it with Pride & Prejudice.
4,Good Interpretation of the Book,Most of the major points of the book come across in this film. The DVD looks good and as a film it has a good feel to it for the period. The acting is top notch and the photography is beautiful. A good effort all around.
5,Beautiful harmony of guitar,"I love traditional Irish music -- especially Irish guitar music. There was only one sample available from this album, but I enjoyed it enough to take the chance. (The actual sample was of Track 1, not of Track 17 as indicated.) The gamble paid off. Each of these artists is a great talent. They play with a beautiful spirit and their songs communicate the aesthetic and romance of old Ireland. The real treat is how well these two play together. Truly outstanding! I cannot stop listening. My hat is off to them, and my thanks to them for breathing life into a world beaten down with bad news. I believe that anyone who enjoys the music of Pat Kirtley, Donal Clancy or Randall Bays will enjoy Carol Barney and John Sherman's Ceol Anam, too. Sadly, when I searched for more information on Carol, I found a memorial page, written apparently by John Sherman. But let it not end here, for that spirit which is all that was Carol will cross our paths again, undoubtedly with beauty."
4,One of the most explicit non-porn movies...,"Warning - this movie is not for the faint hearted. It is the most explicit unrated movie I've seen. Very sexual, but not really in a titilating way. Some scenes are very disturbing. Only recommended if you like arthouse movies that push the boundries of modern film making."
1,Oh I get it! This is probably what Breillat had in mind when making the movie:,"Throw a bunch of genitals terms in one sentence combined with ""woman"" and ""man obsession with female genitals"", shoot a bunch of hardcore sex scenes, spread a ""men are evil and should die"" message across and you have Anatomy of Hell, let alone any Catherine Breillat movie.Though for some people (people who don't know what good art-house cinema is), that may be a good thing."
1,Y-U-C-K!!! Disgusting and pointless,"This has to be one of the most torturous, masochistic experiences I have ever endured. The plot is thread-bare (desperate woman pays gay man to keep her company), the acting is horrific (Rocco had better co-stars in his porn movies), and some scenes that ""push the envelope"" are grosser and more disturbing than the visuals in ""Jackass"". Bring a barf bag before sticking this DVD into the player. It's baffling how garbage like this can be called cinema. There is a fine line between being creative and seeking solely to shock. This garbage is the latter. My advice? Avoid at all costs."
2,More silly than profound,"You probably know the story line: a woman goes to a gay maleclub and slashes her wrists in the toilet. A patron of the club findsher, saves her and they strike a bargain. She will pay him to watchher expose herself and tell her what he sees and feels. Essentially,he is to be a reporter and she an audience of one. You get the sensethat Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to buy this channel.So, with that introduction, we have a string of graphic sex scenesand pompous pronouncements on the nature of male/femalerelationships. It's hard to say which is more boring.You may be a bitamused that the male protagonist and recipient of all this wisdom is gay.Or you may find that to be merely another aspect of the overallbombasticity and pretentiouscity of this thoroughly silly film.--Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine"
3,Just as I am,I was disappointed with the cd. I have other Andy Griffith cd's that are much better. I would prefer if the hymns were separated rather than having 2 or 3 together.
4,Helpful but not Necessary,"This book is a great help for beginners and helps you reveal secret items around every corner within the game. But if you're planning not to spoil yourself like I myself. My words to you would be, not to buy it and experience all the action without the unnecessary spoilers for upcoming battles."
2,"Once Again, Prima Fails To Deliver","I strongly discourage the purchase of this guide. Prima demonstrates in this guide that, yet again, if you can't play the game their way, you can't play it at all. The guide is set up in a step-by-step format, telling you specifically what characters to be used, and when they are to be used, turn-by-turn. Because of Fire Emblem's chanciness, the advice offered by this guide is just short of absolutely useless. Utter garbage. Its sole saving grace is the art featured throughout the book."
4,takes some getting used to,"this doesn't compare to ""making friends"" or the brillian ""Daily Grind"" as it is much slower and softer. it takes some getting used to but its pretty good. i don't necessarily mind the slower stuff (i can always pop in a slayer album for fast stuff) but what bugs me is WHY ARE ALL THE SONGS 3 MINUTES+? anything over 2-3 min is too long, this is what drags it down."
2,Pride,"I listened to these and found that most songs are slow and not that great. But they have good lyrics, easy to sing-along with and flows easily. I think it would be better to go on iTunes, Zune Marketplace, wherever, and just buy the song ""Pride"" from this CD. it's a great song."
3,No Use is losing it,"This was the first NUFAN cd I bought and I gotta tell you, I was a little disappointed. I had heard a ton of their songs before and heard their new one was coming out soon. I was really excited because I loved their old style. When I bought it I was disappointed cuz it was all soft. I mean ""Chasing Rainbows"", come on. What happened to their faster-paced punk music. Anyway, it kind of grows on you after a few listens, but I would recommend getting Making Friends or Le Cheche Con Carne"
2,This isn't NUFAN anymore!,"Sorry, but since Leche con Carne NUFAN has changed a lot - and I don't mean they improved. Sure, this still is a pretty good CD, but it's no Punkrock but rather emotional SOFTROCK!"
2,Not heavy or fast enough for me,"This album is a major departure from all of their previous albums. Compared to their older, faster paced, and heavier albums, this album sounds weak. If you are a fan of their earlier stuff this album might not be a smart buy at all. It's overly poppy, and worse yet its not poppy in a good way like some other pop punk albums. Some people in their reviews said that this album gets better after a couple of listens, but for right now its collecting dust in my room."
5,soft and emotional but very good,"This new album from NUFAN is a little softer and slower than most of their other releases, but it is the best cd to buy that is a little soft and emotional.If you have listened to any of the lyrics to the other NUFAN Cd's you would notice that they are enotional too. It's nothing new. They just have more harmony in this cd. It's like a sing-along cd. something your mom would even like. When I say it's slow thats only some songs I still get a rush out of some of the good build-up's on tracks like 9, 11, 1, they're all good."
3,dissapointing,"their last cd was amazing. This one's softer, not that there's anything wrong with that by it's self. The songs just aren't that good."
5,A great album from a great band,"This is a great new album from NUFAN, i just got it today and it has been playing nonstop since noon. A must have."
4,More betterness... but not thier best....,"This is a great album, don't get me wrong... But this was a little on the slow side when I firs heard it... But after listening to it a few times... I got to like it.... This is a slower album, but still punk none the less... This is a sad album for another reason... This is the lasst album the Chris Shifflet aka Jake Jackson is playing guitar on, as he has left the punk scene for a bit more cash and now plays for the Foo Fighters (sell out?)... Never the less Dave Nassie has taken his place and is more than capable... These guys put on one hell of a show, so if you get the chance to see them live.... Take it.... Later..."
5,You Need This Album,"This is No Use's best work to date...if you like the melodic punk style of Unwritten Law you will love this album...Skip song #7, its the only bad song on the entire album...this is probably one of the top 3 albums I've bought this year...(out of about 60)"
5,The best CD they have ever done,If you are thinking of buying a no use cd buy this one first. It is amazing.
4,Good melodic punk,"I am a fan of No Use and have 4 of their albums, and this is by far their most melodic. It isn't a bad album, it's just different from their other stuff, being more about emotion than merely fast guitars. It does have some great tracks, such as 'Pride' and 'Six Degrees From Misty'. This was my first No Use album and I recommend it as a starter for other punk fans looking for a good new band. Not as good as their 'Live in a Dive' album however..."
2,These are not Coeds!,If your looking for 35+ year old girls with Huge brests then this is for you. but not if your looking for Coeds from college.
5,"I don't care if my wife calls me the ""Hamburgler.""","Sturdy, soft, and comfortable. My wife says I look like I just broke out of prison when I wear them. But the ribbing is well worth the comfort and quality."
3,Good Family Movie,Movie is well worth the watch. Gives the pirate theme but doesn't give your kids a nightmare. Something the family can watch more than once
1,Film Teaches Questionable Lessons,"Overall, a disappointing movie with bad acting, poor continuity, and sub-par special effects. The Labou animatronic is reminiscent of a 1980's Teddy Ruxpin. More disturbing are the lessons that your child might learn from this film, such as: It's OK to mutilate a library book, particularly if it is the only copy in existence. And it's OK to wander around for 2 days in a swamp near New Orleans (the city with the highest rate of overall crime in the country) without any adult supervision."
4,art of exlaining the hardest facts heartily,the book was very good but to follow the tips are very har
2,No where near Miami 05---,This unfortunately is the music you unwillingly listen to in abercrombie and fitch stores. A big dissapointment. I love miami 05 and i download all of markus schulz global dj broadcasts and its hard to believe he even made this cd. Besides the horrible woman vocal songs the instrumentals are weak and repetitive. Buy this if u want to share the awe of how shockingly horrible this cd is. i hope my boy does make a miami 06 that is like the first or something like the music he plays on his radio broadcasts...
2,"I love Miami '05, but what is this?!?!?!?!?!","If you're looking for his AWESOME Miami '05 sound (favorite CD of late), or what he's playing in his live sets - YOU WON'T FIND IT HERE! This is Markus meets so-so vocal trance with poor lyrics. I guess he's trying out different things, but leave the vocal to ATB and stick with the gritty/dark trance we all love....and even his best song on the CD, Without You Near, even though it has 2 mixes, isn't the same, or nearly as good, as what he plays live/mixed! I heard this track on a Gabriel & Dresden set awhile back, and again on a recent Markus mix, and it totally rocks the way they spin it - but the CD versions are poor in comparison. The You Won't See Me Cry re-mix is nice, but I liked the original more.All in all, you should really pass on this one, or at least listen to it first before buying. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!"
4,Wonderful Collection of Guitar Instrumentals,"In his comments on each tune, Phil Keaggy begins by referring to these pieces as ""loose sketches,"" and for the most part that's what they are; not necessarily fully realized songs, but simply sketches. But these are wonderful sketches, to be sure. Listen to the classical influences of ""Rivulets,"" Michael Hedges tapping style on ""Del's Bells,"" the Chet Atkins-inspired picking on ""Paka,"" the bluesy funk of ""Jam in the Pocket,"" and the haunting ""Legacy.""On most of the tracks, it's simply Keaggy and his guitar (or accasionally accompanying himself), but on the spiritual ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" he is joined by a second guitarist on slide guitar and a tuba(!) player to marvelous effect.All told, this is a very enjoyable album, and perhaps my favorite Phil Keaggy CD. [Running Time - 63:20] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,To Give Phil 4 Stars is Still Saying Something,"Although I give Master and Musician and Beyond Nature 5 stars, I will have to give this one 4. Keaggy being my favorite guitarist, 4 is still a cut above most. Rivulets, Legacy, and Spend My Life With You are worth the price alone, but his rendition of Swing Low Sweet Chariot is a little cheesy. The sounds are a little sharper and less warm than Beyond Nature. But still an excellent listen and well worth the time."
3,"Hmm, o.k. I guess.","Not as inspiring as Bejond Nature but nice to have all the same. Some of the tracks are instrumental versions of songs such as ""Spend my life with you"" for which it helps if you know the original. As usual Phil's skills are to the fore but I was waiting for a humable tune sometimes. Perhaps you need to be in the right mood. When you are this will go down a treat."
4,Very Well Done,"The other reviews have done a good job praising the musical content, and I agree that the music is great, but I want to bring notice to something a little different. I think that the CD jacket is great. Phil has written an explanation of each piece, including the instruments he used and alternate tunings as well as the recording method and inspiration. Very well done."
3,"Good, but more of B side collection that album","There is no doubt that phil is a great guitar player, but this is not a definitive Keaggy album. Although this album does contain a few magical riffs here and there, they don't seem to be very cohesive with one another, keaggy himself admits in the liner notes that that some of the songs ones that didn't make his other albums. I like the album, but I'm glad it was given to me as gift instead of buying it."
