3,Must read for Western anthropology,"Hmm...I have a nice little Paladin paperback but, in either hardback or paper, Childe's book is a classic that should be required reading for any student of Western history. The book was first published in 1925 and has gone through several revisions and I'm sure that modern students can find arguments with some of Childe's histories. Still, though, I found it to be good reading (sometimes a little pedantic) and it gave me a good sense of the outline of early European history. A great reference book."
5,"Class, Design and functionality","This is a beautiful watch, perfect size, desing and weight! I'm a collector of watches and with no doubt this is one of the best adition to my collection.The face of the watch is a very very light silver tone (almost white) it has vertical stripes which gives a very fine look, if you take a look at the first picture show by amazon the face looks tottaly white which is not totally accurate.This bulova shows the day of the week on the left side with a blue handle which looks very fine, the indicator on the right side is the date, a little bit small numbers but not a huge issue, and below is the 24hr indicator with little screws on the sides which are a very nice detail. The bulova sign is on the side knob wich is anothe nice detail on all bulova watches. The strap is from good materials.Overall if you are looking for a very nice watch this is a great selection."
5,Amazing watch!,The watch was even better in person! The service was fast and the product was beautiful. It was a gift and he really loved it! thanks! :)
4,very nice watch,this is a very nice and comfortable watch.the silver on this watch has a lot of shine to it and so does the black leather band.the only reason i didn't give this watch 5 stars is because of the very small numbers on the date dial.i think they should of made the crystal where it magnifies over the date dial.the 24hr dial is big enough to see without putting the watch in your face.overall this is a very nice watch and i recommend it to anyone needing a nice quality watch.
4,Slightly disappointed,"I received my watch today with much anticipation but it was a bit short lived, I actually thought the watchface would of been a bit bigger. I have huge hands so it looks small on my wrist. Besides that the watch looks elegant. I received it as a birthday gift from my girlfiend so I am going to apreciate it a whole lot. Delivery was great. It reached my skybox on the date they said it would."
2,Overpriced for what you get,Bottom line.......flimsy and cheap. I sent them back. They were bent and didn't sit correctly when worn. The color of the lenses were just plain wierd.
1,A BAD REMAKE OF HIS WORK,"I've been a John Marytn fan for a long time and picked up this collection hoping it would be worthwhile. IT'S NOT.Instead, it contains miserable reworkings of his best songs and some items that should never have been released. The way he butchers ""May You Never"", ""Solid Air"" and other is incredible.I don't know how or why this collection came about, but if you're a fan of his or someone told you to get some John Martyn's music.. get his early releases. This is not representative of his best work.If you think I'm angry you're right. I wasted nearly 20 bucks that would have been much better spent on almost anything else."
5,Made to be read aloud.,"This book is so sweet and so cute. The illustrations are in soft and soothing blues, grays, and greens with cute little faces on all the characters and a nice focus on the nature with things like rabbits, owls, kittens, and squirrels. Readers are treated to a kind world within these pages (the owls don't eat the rabbits).However, my favorite part of ""What is a Whispery Secret?"" is the text. There are lots of soothing 's' sounds as the author goes through breeze in the grass, leaves on the wind, and soft voices which makes the book a great one for encouraging children to develop a love of word sounds. At the end of the book, cuddling and closeness is encouraged as the text is intended to be read partly in whispers, as prompted by small italicized font. This book is a great read-aloud before a nap or bedtime.An excellent gift for any young family! And I still enjoy reading it to myself at the age of 35!"
5,As someone who has used this book a lot,"As a keen Australian trekker I have used this guide extensively.It is excellent.The range of walks is very well selected, and the notes are concise and clear.I would highly recommend this guide, either for an overseas tourist, or an Australian.One important point: mine is the 4th edition. I think there are more recent editions. Things change. Make sure you check with the relevant park authorities on the latest tracks and conditions before you head off into the wilderness."
1,Would be a great book but.....,"I too got hooked into purchasing the book because I am studying for CCIE, but also because it looked to be a great reference manual (Frame formats, headers, etc). Problem is, some of the material is WRONG! I am not that knowledgeable about some of the subjects but even I could tell the mistakes (in the chapters where there is no reprint that I know of). If the information was correct, this would be a five star book, but still could not be used to pass the CCIE written exam by itself because of the lack of IOS commands.Some of the past reviewers go on and on about how the CCIE is suppose to be hard, and that books are just guides, nothing like real-life experience, etc, etc. Thats fine, but the book is still WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.The reading style and flow is terrible. It reads like they just cut-and-pasted other manuals and reference material into one book.This is not fiction. If you learn incorrect information, you're going to suffer (and look incompetent)."
3,Good Concepts....LOUSY Excecution,"The book has some good concepts in it but is not a CCIE prep book by all means. There is a complete lack of IOS commands. I don't know who came up with the answers to the test questions but they don't have a clue. I found about half of the ip addressing questions to be in error. Apparently someone doesn't understand how IP addressing works.Some of the concepts were taken to an extreme while others were left by the way side. IPX is a good example. Seems that a majority of the chapter surrounded NLSP when there should be more to RIP/SAP management. How many real world NLSP only installs do you see? How about the DHCP section??? More to IP than DHCP in my opinion.If you are looking for some concepts this book can be ok, although you will begin to second guess the information in it. If you are looking for CCIE type help go elsewhere!!!"
1,A lot of errors. I was disapointed,The book was loaded with inaccuracies. How can you study for an exam if your study guide is wrong? I don't think that it was ready for press. I get a little concerned when I can find wrong information in the stuff that I know. What about the stuff that I don't?
2,"RUSH, RUSH, RUSH","This book seems to have been rushed to press. I have noticed and research several mistakes in this book. Be careful. There is tons of useful information, but use another source to support questionable material. Some items were blatantly wrong."
2,"Very confusing,many typos, & some answers are wrong.","This book is not easy to read. I've read many networking books in the past, and this one was the hardest to stay awake for. The answers to some of the questions were wrong or contradicted each other. Also the examples just confused you more. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK,"this is one of the worst written books that i have ever read. it has alot of information and the author seems very good, except the writing style is horrible. this book was never even tech reviewed (if it would have been it would not have been published.) i have found about 250 mistakes and places where the book contradicts itself. Wait and hope they make changes in a second edition..."
2,1,"The book combines all three of the CCIE tracks into one book, but does not separate the tracks within the book so the reader is reading, probably studying material that will not be in his or her track. To call this book a study-guide is misleading. I found the book to be more like a technical reference manual. It does not hi-lite any important points leaving you guessing what areas might be covered on the test. The authors were careless in putting the book together, I several mistakes in the question\answer sections, like what does TCP stand for... they answered it wrong. Can you believe that ?"
2,Information is there but who wrote the questions?,"To be fair, I have not yet finished the book.The information covered in each of the chapters seems to all be there, however it is repeated over and over again in a very redundant fashion. The chapters do not appear to be well organized.The questions very often don't make sense or are incoherent. The answers are very often wrong and contradict the answers to other questions. Who wrote these questions?"
2,"Person, who pass the Sylvan test","I agree with reader from Canada. This book has an excellent shape, but unfortunately, this shape doesn't help in preparation to LAB. Anyway, thanks to author for good idea."
2,Worth buying but needs a great deal of work.,"The book reads like a rough draft. Some of the verbage is diffucult to follow and is reapeated with numerous inconsitances. The pratice questions were usefull but there were a number of errors that need correcting and many questions were pointless or self evident.Structure should be a high priority on the rewrite. The book could probably be shortened by a hundred pages or so if redundancy was removed. Numerous grammar mistakes were a surprise, and I found myself wondering who the editor was at many times.The book did not reflect the CCIE written test catagories very well and the complete lack of IOS commands was disappointing.The book is worth buying but just barely. If you can wait for the second edition do so, if not it's worth the price of admitance."
1,The book was very poorly written with many mistakes.,"I felt that I did not get my money worth it with this book. There were many mistakes found in the book and in the answer keys as well. Some concept was not fully presented, i.e., the OSPF interface types (NBMA, point-to-point etc...). Other concept was presented repeatly for no purpose; hence, could be confusing to the reader.Overall, this book should be off the selling list until after a thorough editing is completed."
1,Very Disappointing,Wow the first book to hit the market and such a flop... It had the opportunity to set the standard against which everybody else would be judged on this topic. The book has no flow or logical order. I cannot see the value it would have in all but the most rudamentary studying for the CCIE. The amount of errors are very disturbing. BUY THIS BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK.
3,"Excellent book for the CCIE written exam,","This book is an excellent guide to pass the ccie written exam, due to the detailed nature, it's not recommend for beginners. This book along with the design and case studies should give anyone a good start."
2,"A LOT of information, but also a LOT of confusion!","I bought this book hoping that it would give me a place to START my CCIE studies. However, because of the way the book is set up (sections, paragraphs, grouping similar concepts) it was so counter-intuitive that I couldn't graph a lot of the concepts. I just plain couldn't tell whether I was into a new subject or still in the old one! Still, there is a LOT of good information in here, and I found gems of wisdom in some of the subjects that I already knew. I recommend this book to established pros, but rookies stay away!"
1,Pick a page and see how many errors you find!,"This book claims to be a study guide! You can't trust the material because there are so many basic errors, how could the more technical issues be any more accurate. A dissapointing waste of money."
2,An OK networking book but a poor CCIE study guide.,"I was disappointed in this book. I have been studying for the CCIE written and found most the sample questions more fitting for either the CNX exam. There are numerous typographical errors (indicating poor QC of the book), numerous repetitions of a point, an occasional reference to an acronym before its' definition was given and a couple of incorrect technical points. Some chapters of the book go into way too much detail and other chapters not enough. Most of the sample questions cover material not covered in the book. I did use parts of the book to study for my CCIE but I had to supplement it with several other books to fill in the gaps. A fair portion of the CCIE exam covers the IOS command set which the book totally ignores. I think this book needs to be heavily edited before a new edition comes out. If either the author or the publisher wishes I will gladly send them my highlighted copy of the book so they can fix the bugs.IMHOMark Klotzbach"
3,Wait for the 2nd Edition,"After having waited 4 months for this book to be published, it was a let down to see that the book was rushed onto the market. Once all the errata's have been fixed, it will be a superb book - Better just waiting"
2,Wanted: Good Technical Writer,"Chalked full of mistakes and erroneous information. It appears that it was cut and pasted together out of other materials. A lot technical errors. The 2,000 questions include ""CHALLENGE QUESTIONS"" which have no published answers. I gave it two stars because its the ONLY printed book designed for studying for the CCIE exam. If you are just studying for a CCNA or CCNP there other companies on the web which do a much better job of putting the information together. I guarantee that nobody including the author has read the book from cover to cover without falling asleep at least 5 or 6 times. This book is about as much fun to read as book full of calculus equations (without answers)."
4,"Complex in depth boring reading, but covers most areas.","Being a CCIE myself, I try to keep up on new books written for CCIE study. After reading the first 6 chapters of this book, Ive come to agree that it is a good book for study and preperation, but it does have many confusing parts. Studying for a CCIE is hard enough, having poorly written paragraphs makes it even harder. Overall content covers most ares needed for a CCIE. I give it 4 stars."
3,Author's Qualifications,"Please note that the author is a CCI, a Cisco Certified Instructor. To gain this certification one must pass the written exam for each class that they wish to teach. They must also pass a two week ""train the trainer"" program at Cisco Headquarters. It's not an easy program to complete, and TtT is supposed to be a nightmare.There are a lot less CCI's out there than CCIE's, and I think that the certifications both convey that one has a strong knowledge of Cisco products and networking technologies. CCIE's probably have more ""real world"" experience while CCI's have more experience putting complex concepts into a language that a beginner can understand. Each has it's strength."
4,"""Tons of Information more than enough""!","If you're looking for a quick fix and to pass the exam without practical experience, don't buy this book! THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR THE SERIOUS STUDENT! The book is designed and writen to give you a fundamental understanding of networking, so that you can prepare for the CCIE exam.The author Roosevelt Giles has helped thousands of students pass the CCIE test at his training company."
1,This book should have an appendix for its own errors,"As a person who has achieve virtually every popular certification in the industry, my opinion of this book rates VERY low. Its one thing to give wrong information in a study text to neophytes. But this book contradicts ITSELF on many pages. Its obvious that this book had several writers who did not take the time to collaborate. I've flagged over twenty HARD errors in the first four chapters. Its just more certification hype. Save your time and money."
1,Do not purchase this book,"I just read most of this book and found it very USELESS. The book is thick and does a full circle of trying to say what the point is. There are NUMEROUS spelling errors, contradictions, etc. I have seen some of the other books, and personally would not purchase anything but CISCO systems (you can also purchase them here at amazon.com) and THOSE are the ones that you will see the information on the test. All in all a complete waste of 100+ dollars."
4,"Roosevelt Giles, A Great Instructor and Author!","As one who has taken a course given by Roosevelt Giles and read ""The CCIE Study Guide"", I must say that the author has done a masterful job of conveying his knowledge.As an exceptional instructor the author is able to convey the same excitement and knowledge using the written word. Especially helpful are the design configs contained on the CD.It's hard to dispute the fact that there are some typos and minor errors in this book. The author maintains a web site dedicated to corrections and new CCIE questions. This helps!I would reccomend taking a course from Roosevelt Giles and buying the book!"
2,Error Rich,This guide has more errors in it than ANY technical manual I have ever read. They appear both in the sample questions and the in-chapter examples. I would wait for the 2nd edition...
1,Very poor proof reader used on this book !,I wish I had read the listed reviews before purchase. The book has little detail and is full of errors.
3,"Good attempt at all conclusive CCIE prep guide, but sloppy","I guess McGraw-Hill was in rush to jump on the bandwagon of CCIE prep books. This book has so many errors in the questions, which appear at the end of each chapter, that you start to wonder if the questions you believe to be right are indeed correct. Also the discussion of various topics are at times unclear as if the author was just throwing out a bunch of info instead of establishing a core of understanding. I suppose as a vehicle to getting people through the Cisco exams this book is of value, but it does not endear itself as great reference for internetworking specifics."
1,Terribly written and filled with errors,"This book is so dry it makes you wish you were doing something else. When you don't have anything else to do and get yourself to sit down and read it, it is filled with errors."
2,"Shape is good, context has to be better...","This book gives a direction but containes so many errors, overlooks and typos that needs to be ""debugged"". Hopefully, the next edition will be right to the point."
2,This book is not what we all hoped it would be,"I just passed the written exam, and it was not by any stretch of imagination due to Giles' book. I had hoped that this book could help me gain focus in preparing for the exam, but instead it took me places where the exam questions were very far from. There are also way too many errors in this book. I do give the author some credit for the attempt to consolidate the vast amount of information, but please wait for the 2nd edition before throwing your money at it."
1,Good Idea but Totally Wrong Presentation,"The only benefit I got from this book ironically is that I have to cross-reference with Cisco documentation and RFCs to make sure the information written is correct. So it makes me read even more than I want to. There are quite a few errors/typos, especially the figures. The chapter on ATM is the worst writting on ATM I have ever read. Nothing but about 100 pages of specifications and accronyms. Totally unorganized. This book needs to be rewritten asap."
3,Good amount of material but poorly written,"While this book covers the material that is on the CCIE written exam, the writing style is fairly choppy, sometimes vague and often hard to follow.However, if you are looking for a one stop shop for helping you prepare for the written exam than this has it all.Please note that you aren't going to become a CCIE with this book, it takes a few years of real-world experience in multiprotocol networking environments. You aren't going to get that from a book or a class.Use this book as a supplement to Radia Perlman's ""Interconnections"" and Chris Lewis' Cisco TCP/IP Networking Reference. Both of these are top notch books that are a must read for those pursuing the CCIE."
1,"Rates 1 ""star"" only because there is no ""0"" rating choice","This is, quite obviously, the worst technical book ever written.Save your money to buy a second-hand router, or one of the excellent Cisco press CCIE books if you actually wish to purchase something useful to your study. If nothing else, buy Radia Perlman's seminal *Interconnections* instead of this travesty.Several reviews here mention Mr. Giles' amazing talent as an instructor. Even if that is the case, not a sliver of ""talent"" is evident in this book.What makes this book even more tragic: I have had the good fortune to take Cisco courses taught by several of the listed contributors. This book does a supreme disservice to their hard-earned reputations as premier instructors."
1,"It would be funny, except for the cost in time and money","Anyone who hates meetings will quickly realize that this was written by a committee. Nobody could've been in charge, and the guy whose name is in big letters on the cover is sure to collect alot of abuse that should rightly go to the editors. It is a fairly big book, but says so little in so many pages that the reader can be lulled into thinking that it is somehow thorough. Furthermore, it can't be considered a learning resource, because there are so many obvious errors that one doesn't know whether or not to trust the rest.It's nice to know that somebody reads these reviews. I've noticed a couple of 4 and 5 star reviews that must have been written by people somehow connected to the project...they are identical word for word. Knowing how to copy and paste is a first step in becoming an editor. If only the editors of this would have known a few more steps."
2,Good as a reference but not for study guide,"Well, there is no doubt that this book has lots of information. However, this is too complicated for beginners. I recommend ICRC Book from Cisco or Sybex CCNA books. Its a good start for a certification.PS: I am not saying this book is bad, it is just to hard to undertand."
1,Excellent Education Technique,"I think most of the reviewers here have missed the point by complaining about the multitude of errors in this book! The idea, of course, is to force the reader to work out the contradictions, inconsistencies and outright incorrectness of the questions and answers and thereby encourage a true understanding of the subject. What a great book this really is, it obviously aims to train the reader to deal with the gluttony of misinformation that exits in the ""real world"". Of course, some readers may want the easy way out and not want to find the secret errors that proliferate throughout this book, but instead want a reference book that will simply, yet comprehensively, explain computer networking fundamentals. For these people, this is NOT the book to buy."
4,Try it for yourself!,"I read all the reviews carefully, but decided to purchase the book. I was not disappointed!The CCIE Study Guide by Roosevelt Giles is a good book. There are plenty of questions at end of the Chapters to to test your knowledge.The chapters are well written, and the author has great advice for preparing for the exams."
1,It is useless.,It covers a lot of ground but not deep enough. There are alot of redendent questions with contridictory answers. I think this is the worst book I ever read.
4,Helps you prepare for the CCIE written exam!,"This book was an excellent tool in helping me prepare for the written exam! I passed on the first try, of course I also set-up a few routers in my basement so that I could see things for myself! Now it's onto to the two-day hands on lab exam.This book gives you info that's just not included in the books by Cisco Press. The Cisco Press books are just repackaged Cisco documentation. Giles takes you inside the CCIE written exam and gives you the inside track.I would suggest using this book as a supplement to hands-on experience"
4,Stitch Magic,"I bought this book for my wife. She loves the book, ""It's amazing."" Very detailed photographs. The only problem is that it has a very musty smell. She is waiting and hopes that it will disperse with time."
4,Not like the picture,"You don't get the blue handles.But if your ordering these, you probably don't care.There are lots of better than stock handles out there for 'em, or just wrap them with friction tape like I did."
4,stewart,"good book in overall content. Lacks really detailed examples when you get stuck. Notation is simple enough, but text itself does not always follow suite."
2,Buy another book,"Out of all the Calculus books I've ever come across, I've never found one that's more amazingly difficult to understand and comprehend. If you're stuck with this book for a University class, please pick up another one to learn from. Having a deep math background and trying to ""brush up"" on Calculus, this book made me confused and didn't coincide with how I learned Calculus the first time.The sad thing is that I gave this book 2 stars mainly for the picture of the Guggenheim Bilbao on front."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Had to use this book for Calc I - It was based on so much theory and derivations, I did not understand a word of it. I guess I could put it this way: Im an A student and I got a D in calc I (which ISNT passing if your an Engineer). I did try, but this book is IMPOSSIBLE. It doesnt explain things clearly - its almost like they expect you to already KNOW calc. It might be decent for a refresher course where you have already had calculus and UNDERSTAND it, but if havnt had calc before this ISNT the book for you!!"
2,Calculus:Concepts and Contexts,"I used this textbook for my high school calculus class, and we found many mistakes in the book itself. The textbook is quite large in size, but I think it is missing some important topics. Also, the explainations for solving different problems is extremely vague and I personally had a lot of trouble just trying to figure out what the author was getting at, rather than trying to figure out the math problems. I would not recommend this book because the explainations are too vague and difficult to comprehend."
1,Would not recommend buying this book....,"The college I attend uses this book in their calculus classes. I can honestly say that without using Calculus, sixth edition (Larson et. al.), as a supplement in my Calc II class, I would not be passing the class. Stewart's treatment of the material leans toward the abstract. Combine that with an alarming scarcity of relevent examples and trying to learn calculus from this text can be quite frustrating."
3,"Nice inlays,but..","The author's complete lack of examples that actually explain the actual problems in the chapter, is slightly unnerving."
3,sparse on educational material,"All in all, this book can much better serve as a reference than actual teaching material.Although big and expensive, the book misses a few key topics, which my Calculus teacher was than happy to pinpoint (e.g., lack of explanation of theorems such as the Extreme Value Theorem). On some topics it is extremely diffiult to teach oneself something, which you expect from such an expensive book. Other books do a much better job.Throughout the book in each section, one of two things tends to be missing: either examples or the background information. The author either misses explaining concretely the meaning (and significance) of a theorem, or he ""forgets"" to put enough examples to suit anyone. For example, there are way too few example problems for partial fractions (esp. more difficult ones) . It was tedious even for me, someone who had already taken partial fractions.So, overall, don't buy this book until it is required material. I don't see any other reason to."
2,Redundant,"For those that are looking for something new and different to become inspired, this is not the choice. Just a bunch of inspiring sentences over and over again that seem redundant."
3,A FEW CLASSIC CLUB ANTHEMS,"FOR SOMEONE NEW TO DANCE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD AND CHEAP PLACE TO START. A FEW POPULAR CLUB SONGS THAT ARE WORTH THE WHOLE CD. I'D PAY THAT MUCH JUST FOR BORN SLIPPY, BUT OF COUSE WE ALL HAVE THAT ALREADY ON THE TRAINSPOTTING SOUNDTRACK."
2,Not a Good Program to Learn Japanese,"This Product is not going to teach you Japanese. All this program offers is vocabulary and nothing else. If you are a beginner at Japanese, there is no way this program can help you. I would not suggest buying this product."
1,"Not one of the 100,000 corpses made it in. Not one.","The dust jacket of this book boasts that it is ""the first comprehensive photographic record of the bombings"". However, its idea of comprehensiveness - while finding room for a film poster of the 1952 Robert Taylor movie ""Above and Beyond"" - does not include *a single one* of the tens of thousands of corpses littering the ground of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.That's right. As far as the 500+ photographs in this ""objective, informative volume"" [quoting the dust jacket again] are concerned, our two atomic bombs - while producing a lot of rubble and five mild burn victims - did not cause a single fatality.The chief author of this book is identified as ""a retired U.S. Air Force officer"". Make of this what you like."
1,Disgusted,"Considering this book is supposed to be a photographic history, I'm really disgusted that there aren't photographs included of the fatalities. It's a slap in the face to the people who died, to the survivors who had to somehow move on from the atrocity. It's simply wrong."
4,She's bringing it on,"Buy it just for track 3, work that body.An excelent album, not the style I would expect from G-stone, but funkier, smoother. A must for fans of naked music, chilled house/funk/downtempo."
4,Sounds great but no match,I purchased this center channel speaker to replace a Paradigm center speaker with a blown tweeter. The Polk Audio sound great but it was too bright for my Paradigm Monitor 7s. I sent it back a purchased a replacement tweeter for my Paradigm.~eddie
1,Constant Headache,"We purchased a pair of infocus projectors 2 1/2 years ago for classroom use and have been through repeated problems with both of them as well as the multiple replacement units that we have been sent. They apparently have very poor quality power supplies (we have had at least 3 fail). We have also had two separate lamps explode within the projector, destroying the unit. Several others have merely decideded not to function. Avoid these projectors!"
2,OK but not Great,"A tougher read than I expected and not all that reveling to me, but, I did plow through it. Not many gems to harvest here, however."
3,"great topic, interesting ideas","I have read some previous books of this author and I have liked them more. This seemed to be an addition to the same series of great text books. However, I only gave three stars because I did not find so much new, original, innovative ideas in this book than in his previous books. But this books is definitely worth reading."
4,Great book on Innovation,"While global markets continue to commoditize both products and services, continuous innovation is the only real response. The book shows technology management ""how to"" grow innovation, how to look at your competition for competitive advantage and how to innovate in a growing market as well as in a mature or declining market. It's all about competitive advantage in a world of commoditization. I see this in my business as well when companies try to commoditize the executive search business. This book shows you how to gain a competitive advantage and increase your ""core"" substantially.Gary PermanPres. Permantech[...].gary@permantech.com"
2,useful beginning ...,"I found the framework he introduced to be useful, but then it just went on with more models & examples that just made it painful to read.I'm a real fan of Moore and his work, but seems like this one is just a weak line extension of his prior work.IMO, this would have made a better white paper or article, than to drag out the concept into a full fledge book"
4,Focus and Research are Key,"As an employee of a small company faced with the challenge of selling a relavitvely new product in a evolving niche it is clear to me the only way to out-compete the five or six other companies with a similar product is to follow Moore's advice and take the product to a niche market we can dominate in order to get out of the ""chasm."" I like his detailed explanation of ""core"" vs. ""context"" and especially liked the detailed suggestions for innovation at every stage of the technology life cycle. He offers step by step instructions to choose an innovation ""vector"" and gain acceptance in your organization. I found this book helpul to put a framework around our competitive challenges and market opportunities."
1,sorry i must be lost,i tried to read this book....maybe i am not a genius but this can only be described as arty-farty claptrap...mine is an ex-library book that was taken out 5 times in 14 years...say no more.....save your pennies
5,epic muscial journey,The newest CD by Bassnectar has blown me out of the water so to speak. it is amazing and it had me interested the whoel time. Lorin is a pioneer in the music industry and you would be doing yourself a favor to buy this CD and listen to it with the bass turned high to experience extacly what this world is all about.
1,No Second CD!!!,"The album rocks, but they only give you the first CD, which is very trancey but if you want the breakbeat stuff and teh song ""simultaneous"" it's not on there!"
4,Fat fat bass and some very funky grooves,"4.47 starsExcellent production, imaginative mixes, socially-conscious moments without getting preachy.And huge bass all over the place. Only a club's massive sub will do justice to this bass, but your car will certainly roll sweet with this stuff pumping out.I prefer live funk to electro djs for dancing, but BN is one of the best djs I've ever heard and gets my rump shaking within seconds."
3,"Watch out, the full CD version is 2 disks - and some good tracks are missing.","I was about to buy this, when I noticed that 'Simultaneous', the track that I'd heard that brought me here was not in the listing. It turns out that the CD version of this is 2 disks, but the download includes only one of them.Clearly the price isn't bad, and the music is still good. Just be aware that you're not getting all of it."
4,Great educational read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. After watching the movie several years ago, I was very interested in learning more about the subject. The author wrote excellently on the topic, engaging the reader from the first chapter. I encourage others to read this book, as it is an important piece of American history.I received this book from Dorrance Publishing as a part of their review team."
4,A Tale Worth Telling,"This is one of the most interesting subjects I have come across in a long time. Page after page, it kept my interest, and left me looking forward to reading more. There is not enough known in present day about some of the facts of our past, and every story that can be told should be shared. Especially pertinent is the fact that we are now in the internet stage, stories like this share with people today how technology used to be, and all the options that were utilized. I had heard of Navajo talkers, but didn't have the knowledge of what their work actually involved. It was an eye-opening narrative.I received a complimentary copy of (Book Title) as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit dorrancebookstore.com to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team. [...]"
1,Amateurishly written,"I have read every book written on the subject of Navajo code talkers and while this deserves kudos as being among the first, it is without question the most poorly organized and written. Also, there is a great deal of misinformation within these pages.Do yourself a favor, read Navajo Weapon by Sally McCain instead. It is the best on the subject...well written and very well researched."
3,Overall Pretty Good,"So I am a current student. I bought this book because it was a required text for the class Introduction to Cultural Anthropology. I feel like it does a good job at letting you know about the field of anthropology and the influential people it included. It talks briefly about the different components of culture and anthropology. Sometimes I wish it would have elaborated more about certain things. I also founded it quite opinionated but I could be wrong.It's super portable, so that's a plus."
2,An endurance test for me,"I had to roam my way through this short introduction by hard scratches across my forehead and many teeth grindings for my Anthropology class. After my completion, I have to say that I didn't absorb much of info that were provided within. The wording of this book might be confusing to a lot of people who have slight dyslexia, such as me. I had a lot of problem following the sequencing of each plot, such as what happened in the Dou Donggo family feud passage. Indeed, it is certainly recommended for anyone with an above average verbal IQ. But be warned, if you are not much of a prolific reader, this short pamphlet can really make you feel like as if you are stuck in the highway while on your way to work!"
5,When it was death to celebrate the Mass,"Anyone who has read ""The Stripping of the Altars"", which showed how devoutly Catholic England was before the reformation will certainly enjoy this short book.Under Elizabeth, it was death to celebrate Mass. Priest hunters, like the notorious Topcliffe, were always on the scent for another victim to be sent to the gallows.This short collection of the people killed for their faith covers all sorts of people, from Margaret Ward, a servant, to the richest man in the country, Philip Howard, who gave up his life at court to die in jail. Many were stretched, hung, stoned, crippled, had various body parts removed, and still remained true to God."
2,good idea but...,I like the idea behind this although if you don't cut the wires flush (which is VERY hard to do) it does not work well.
5,Enchanting & Entertaining,"Anything starring Danny Kaye is pure enchantment... Love the part where he sings with Miss Piggy ' I'm In Heaven' this part of the dvd is delightful! A born Entertainer, long may his Films be loved & appreciated by everyone who loves this very talented & gifted man."
5,Adorable,"Schleich amazes me at how realistic their toys are. Not only are they educational and accurate, they're beautiful!"
3,The Disaster Recovery Handbook,It's a good guide for plainning a Business Disaster Recovery but it should have some samples that will give complete detail of a worst case scenario..DARMAN
2,The Disaster Recovery Handbook,Book did not have the outside cover and had marker stains all over. Not the way it was described when I purchased it.
5,Excellent DRP Concepts,"Great book, explains the business continuity and disaster response concepts clearly and concisely. Able to use the product should I not have online access to my course."
3,The worst of the series but a decent watch,This was definitely the worst installment of the series. The acting was third rate to be honest. The make up effects were nothing like it's predecessors. And the storyline was to be desired.
2,Not scary at all!,"I laughed at this movie from beginning to end. I bought it because it was one of Kris Holden-Ried's earliest works and I am trying to see everything he has been in. He told me not to buy it :) and now I know why. It was not the actors fault though, they gave it a good try but they had nothing to work with. The scrip was beyond awful! Yet if you are a fan of this genre of movie it might give you a good chuckle and make you appreciate the good ones ;)"
5,Just as good as the original and much better than part 2!,"I don't know why people think part 2 is better than part 3 when the third one was closer to being like the original! Part 2 was too weird for me and come on a ""ninja nun""? Ha ha. Part 3 is freaking sweet! Part 2 had to be the weakest out of all of em!!!"
3,"I love the ""Night of the Demon"" movies.","I owned the first two ""Night of the Demons"" for YEARS before I even knew there was a 3rd. So as soon as I saw it on Amazon, I bought it without even seeing it. I'll just say I'm glad to own all three, but the 3rd, doesn't hold up to the first 2."
4,The price is fine,"When I saw Night of the Demons 1, waow the movie are super, the effect is verry nice and the story are awesome, I saw part 2, oky~doky is fine, no super like part 1 but fine, so I see part 3, hujum, firts at all I see all this movie in vhs, and I'am a super collector of horror movie so yeah, I buy this one just for the collection and of course the price is verry nice."
5,Great Halloween flick,"Great movie. As other reviewers stated if you enjoyed the previous and superior Night Of The Demons films you will enjoy this treat. Another group of unlucky victims enter hull house to be greeted on Halloween by the most demonic, evil demon of them all Angela. Great effects as always, Angela is evil personified as always with great scares, humour and a hellish Halloween in this third installment. I hope they make a pt.4 in the vein of the first two amazing films this is truly a great scare filled series."
2,I was highly disappointed!!!!,"This movie was horrendous compared to the first 2. I hated this movie because in my own opinion they turned Angela into a joke. I was scared out of my mind when I saw ""Night of the Demons 2"" but, this one definitely doesn't measure up to the other 2 films. I thought it was kind of stupid and chessy."
2,The beginning title sequence...,...really is neat. the spooks all flying around. I really was hoping this would have been a good movie. The first and second really weren't bad...the lipstick scene in the first one is classic...this is just blah!
2,Disappointing,"When i watched this movie i was expecting it to be up to par with at least the second movie. Maybe i am being a little harsh, but the first two movies blow this third installment away."
2,Night of the Demons 3 REVIEW,"Second sequel to ""Night Of The Demons"" is silly in an entertaining way. Two cast members of the classic Canadian kids' show, ""You Can't Do That On Television"", Stephanie Bauder and Christian Tessier play members of a group of kids who visit a haunted house on Halloween after getting caught up in a bloody liquor store robbery. The plot is full of holes and there is plenty of non-stop gore so if this type of thing pleases you, knock yourself out."
1,Trash,"I liked the first two films, so I had high hopes for this one. What a total disappointment!!. This is a horrible piece of slime that is not worth any viewing time at all. If you liked the first two, like I did, then just stick with those. Skip this horrible mess."
3,Its not widescreen,i love these movies from part 1 to 3 but the 3rd wasnt in widescreen which im spoiled so feel sorry for me
1,ACTING DIRECTING AND A SCRIPT....WHO NEEDS THOSE THINGS?,"Who cares about good acting and writing? This is a horror movie. Fact is, this movie has stupid characters and bad situations...Basically, its the first 2 movies spliced with a new one. I loved the first 2 films, but this one left nothing good behind. The bully with the bad breath? He wont make up his mind if he cares about his ""friends"" or not. One minute hes defending them then the next he's threatening them at gun point. My God! Then we have those 3 UGLY girls. I dident like any of them. Then we have the other 3 guys who are just badly acted characters who will just end up in the mouth of demon-land. My god, the first 2 films had everything a true horror film should have, but this one bit the dust. Terrible. The 4th one will suck too I'm betting....If theres gonna be a 4th...There will be!"
1,Total crap!!,"Almost 90$ for this crap movie?? Give me a break! For that price you can buy 10 much better movies. And totally UNCUT too! Just contact: cryptvideo@hotmail.com for the best, cheapest & most uncut movies of the horror genre!!!"
1,What the HELL is going on here?,"Being a huge fan of the first two n.o.t.d, i must say that this one just made me sick to my stomach...and not in a scared way but in a ""how more stupid can this movie be!"" way!Many things that you'll expect to see in this movie, a canadian production with montreal actors that never practiced the actual art of acting, terrible special effects,the longest opening credit sequence before the movie starts, bad choice of location..especially the ""new"" hull house in the film, totally different from the original, and of course the ending, whoooowww so scarrrryyy, WILL THERE BE NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 4?I think that after watching this movie for yourself, you'll understand why they didn't make another part 4.Thanks to the producers of this film for screwing it all up for us fans!"
2,The weakest of the three NOD,"This movie is only for fans of the series.if you loved or even liked the first two NOD movies then chances are you will like this one.but i must say out of the three this is the weakest of all three.the story moves along alot slower then the last two,theres not much horror,blood or gore and the creepy tone from the other movies are gone too.all in all watch this like i said if your a fan of NOD otherwise i dont think you should bother.this movie isnt availible in the US,only in canada so if you find a copy on amazon itll be the canadian copy but everythings in english so dont worry.enjoy this as part of the series not on its own merrits."
3,Insanely overpriced,Consider this a huge WARNING to any potential buyers. This is a $5 toy - less than ten dollars. It can be found at Big Lots stores. This is a tiny Transformer and it's good for what it is. It is NOT the larger deluxe size toy. Don't pay too much for it and you won't be disappointed.
2,Defective toaster,"Toaster worked fine at first, then about six months later it started taking longer and longer to toast. The oven temp. appears to work fine, however, even at the darkest setting, you must toast a piece of bread twice! Unfortunately, since we received this as a gift and did not start using it right away, it is no longer under warranty and we are stuck with it. If it had still been under warranty, you would have to pay them $5 to ship you a new one. Since their product is defective, I would expect them to pay for the shipping to replace it."
2,Plastic falls off/Toaster button broke,Plastic falls off in various locations. Toaster button broke in about 7 months. So can't toast unless we use 500 setting on oven and watch it til complete. Ringer self-stop now fails to work. Worked ok til now.
5,Please read this book...,"This is an excellent book. Every couple should be issued a copy upon marriage, engagement or serious involvement. Not only does Six in the Bed help you readily identify the notorious power struggles between in-laws and spouses, but it gives you strategies to address the issues as a couple.The conflicts between in-laws and new spouses are so difficult to address, with the new spouse most often being the one who compromises (and suffers) in deference to his or her spouse's reluctance to set new boundaries with family members. This book gives you tools to truly address the issues at hand instead of allowing resentment to grow and damage the couple's relationship.The insight in this book can help protect your marriage, whether as a preventative heads up or as an immediate survival guide."
2,Too much business related - not enough personal.,"I am a stay-at-home mom looking for simple - yet unique - ways to say ""thank you, congratulations, I'm sorry ..."" to various people. This book devotes much of its pages to business-related writing, which I no longer need. While I have found a few nuggets of inspiration here and there, I am not particularly inspired by her suggestions of using, ""I love it!"" for a thank you note or ""thinking of you"" for a sympathy card. I could probably have come up with those on my own."
2,"How to Say It: Choice Words, Phrases, Sentences, and Paragraphs for Every Situation, Revised Edition",This is not what I expected or wanted. The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature. The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use.
5,Great Graduation Gift,"I believe the ability to write a thoughtful and effective letter is an important skill to have, and one that many younger people today are not developing due to all of our electronic communications. I got this for a graduation gift and it has truly helped me become better at writing good letters for my new ""adult"" life, from thank you letters to job correspondence and more."
4,This book has a permanent place on my shelf!,Great book for personal situations. It has been a great source of inspiration for several years. I would have given it five stars if it had a bit more for business situations.
4,"A real ""fun read"" for anyone interested in the magickal arts","This book provides a fictitious account of one brief period in the life of the notorious Aleister Crowley. His followers loved him, others despised him and many feared him and his strange magickal rituals. What possible effect could a ritual performed many, many years ago by Aleister Crowley and Dierdre MacCallum's grandmother, Bridget, have on the present day?Dierdre learns the truth from her dying grandmother and must try to set things right and thus preserve her family history and save her true love.An interesting cast of characters.I think anyone with an interest in the occult will find this novel very hard to put down until you have finished it."
5,couldn't put it down!,"This book is unlike any other book I have ever read! It tells the story of a woman, who inherits her great grandmother's appartment, and finds out there is a door in there which leads 72 years into the past. Contrary to other time travel books, the travel itself isn't what the book focuses on - the ""technical"" aspects of time travel. Neither does it focus on historial facts (like other time travel books). Instead, it focuses on some historical figures, such as the famous Aleister Crowley, and on magick (""real"" magic). Overall, this is a fantasy novel, with a lot of romance in it, but written in a very unique manner. I simply could not put it down! I recommend it to anyone who has an interest (or at least, isn't upset) by reading about magical rituals, likes time travel books - and has a romantic heart ;-)"
2,JUST OK,The time travel aspects of the book enticed me to buy it but I was disappointed. I found myself skipping pages to get to the end. The characters were decidedly unlikable and unsympathetic. The plot was thin and you never really discovered what was going on and why.
2,"Wordy, Difficult to Understand","This book has an important message, but it is hidden in the extremely opaque, scientific and distractingly uninteresting writing style. In fact, I can honestly say I would not have had the patience to read past the first chapter without having been forced to finish it.I wish Lippi-Green would have used a less academic writing style--it would have conveyed her message far more effectively. For a more entertaining and equally educating read try Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct, or Donna-Jo Napoli's Language Matters."
3,Transformers Beast Wars Rattrap,This toy is okay for the older child not young ones. Small parts come off. My kids enjoyed this toy very much.
3,Dragonfarce...super power speed metal,"i'm not sure if i should be laughing or air-guitaring while playing this album by the hilariously named Dragonforce. first of all, i don't think i can even play air guitar as fast as these guys play the real thing...so i guess that i can't laugh *too* hard becasue of the technical skill involved here. basically, this is Helloween's glory days amped up to maximum speed. really really fast melodic power metal...that is probably closer to what one might call ""speed power metal."" the songs rip with mammoth choruses, insanely tight dual guitar harmonies, and some pretty wild energy that's almost non stop (save for one lame attempt at a ballad). perhaps this is what Lost Horizon sounds like after consuming a Jolt/cocaine cocktail. it's good, but such a sugar rush that the fun wears off a little too quickly. by the time the 4th track kicks in, i'm starting to suffer just a little bit. it's still a fun ride, but the joke's not so funny anymore."
2,Kirk Hammet eat your heart out? You're kidding right?,"Ok my nerdy diablo addict friend loves this band, and i suppose fantasy lyrics would appeal to him, but you know what? This band is terrible. Yes, they know how to play their instruments, and apparently quite well. If i could tell one song from the next I might think about actually reviewing this, but there enlies the problem with this band. All of the songs end up with the same tempo, same pattern, same everything. The drummer kicks his double bass pedal as hard as he can every song, the guitarist does a 2 minute solo, the singer talks about how he wishes D&D; was reality. Yaawwwwn! Metallica had a sound I'd actually want to listen to. This band is just plain boring, repetitive, and annoying.2 stars for technical skill"
4,wow,"Let's see, what can be said about this album that has not been already said...well, the fact that these guys have one of the thrashiest solos I have ever heard. I believe the song ""My Spirit Will Go On"" alone is worth the price I paid for this album. I can't really say much about the damn ballad, I skip it all the time (one star off for that). Other than that, great album.For people who are into crap like Godsmack (and love every other band that sound like it), do not pick this one up. This will come up as cheesy and complicated for people who want ""power-chords-o-rama"" with a vocalist that sound like a bootleg Eddie Vedder or a bootleg Layne Staley (R.I.P.) rather than actual technicality and talent. For the Fear Factory crowd, a most definite ""listen-to"". That goes also with the Slayer fans and every other Black Metal and Swedish Death Metal fans. The thrash freaks should welcome this into their library. For Metallica fans, well...JUST GET THE DAMN ALBUM!!!"
4,Whoa,"Despite the cheesy lyrics and repetetiveness of their songwriting techniques, these guys have something very important going for them. They are quite possibly the fastest band on earth (in terms of being able to stay tight the whole time). Anyone who loves fast music will certainly get a kick out of this. Not to mention, individual musicians can appreciate some of the wizardry provided in their difficult to play parts. But like I said, the fact that these guys are laughably fast, really makes them a must have. If you like a collection with a lot of variety and need some SERIOUS speed metal, you gotta get this."
1,The 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' of metal,"Yes, these guys can play their instruments, there is no denying that, But they have no emotion in their playing whatsoever.. It literally sounds like they are trying to put out a 'Best of"" Alvin and the chipmunks album.. All speed--no guts, no glory. And I remember reading reviews on Yngwie, and how all he did was play a thousand notes per minute..true, but he played listenable music and played with tons more emotion than these guys ever will.. Sorry, just not very good. Very bland and uninspired.. They have talent with the instruments, but that's as far as it goes..It's a shame you can't give partial stars, because i think 1 star is too much praise for this sonic crapstorm.."
1,80's strikes back in the form of DRAGONFORCE! Ohh the intensity.,"Just when you thought power metal and hair metal was dead out pops Dragonforce! Get out your mullet wig from the garage, slip on a wife beater, bust out the old D&D; board and rock out to song after song of pure lame, no balls, POWER METAL!. It's so awesome it physically hurts the ear drum. Nothing better than a fantasy oriented POWER METAL! band. It's so amazingly metal it scares me.On a serious note, what in the (...)hell were these worthless dorks thinking. Is there actually a market for this crap. Does Star Trek folk music exist too? Well one question you should ask yourself at this moment is do I really want to waste 13-14 bucks on this joke. If you want to laugh go right ahead otherwise save yourself the agony of hearing this.I'll start throwing a letter grade into my reviews.This album gets a (...)for effort. Effort at (...)This band gets a (...)for extreme lameness."
4,"Funny book, super small",I ignored other reviews that this was a tiny book. It is a REALLY tiny book. Another reviewer said they have seen it in full size. If I were you I would try to find it in a larger size. The cartoons are great though.
2,Disappointing.,"This is a tiny little book (one cartoon per page) which I did not find that funny. I'm a bar certified attorney. As strange as this may seem, perhaps it would be funnier for someone who is less acquainted with the law! I was disappointed, since I usually enjoy the New Yorkers cartoons... but this was a flop for me."
3,Tiny little book,"I thought this book was a regular size book, no where in the description does is say that it is tiny. I was thinking it could be set on a coffee table, but it will more likely get stuck in a drawer somewhere. I was disappointed."
3,Economical,"These are economy-grade finger cymbals, appropriate for use with children. The tone quality is horrible, but these will do for classroom use if you are on a budget!"
4,Good Information,"I took off one star due to the fact that all the people in this book are drawn fat and not enough truth was relayed regarding the takeover of Hawaii by the American capitalists-yes Hawaii was stolen for profit. However, this little guide is excellent in every other way: lots of Hawaiian words, ancient & traditional crafts, great maps & drawings, good immigrant/ethnic coverage, important state facts, & plenty of flora & fauna. Great for Hawaiian vacations, state reports, learning the USA, and for parents/teachers wanting a quick overview. Great value."
3,Coloring book,This was a less enjoyable book for the grandsons. Drawings were not very interesting to the boys and the story had to be read to them.
2,Not much more than a riff on Psycho!,"Psycho (1960) is such a great film. ""DON'T Go In The House"" (1980) is a movie that takes some of its conventions and copies them without offering anything new. A factory worker who keeps his dead mother in his house is haunted by voices and his abusive childhood and begins to make his young female victims experience his nightmares. The main antagonist isn't quite as fun or frightening as Norman Bates, but he is just as weird and crazy. ""DON'T Go In The House"" isn't for everyone... it's a bitter, ugly, and nasty little horror&#65279; movie that doesn't pull any punches and is just as seedy today as it was when it was made. It's effective in that it gets under your skin despite its low budget origins and obvious flaws."
3,my view of this movie,"the movie is about a man so possessed by his mother, that he feels the need to kill, mostly women, and he has a torch room where he burns them up . his mother died so he dresses the womenin his mothers clothes before he burns them.he's really a sick person. all in all i'ts an ok movie"
2,This Movie Is Way Weird,"I thought that this movie was totally weird. It was just like Psycho. (to a certain extent). It was really freaky the way he murdered his victims. That made me very uneasy and a little horrified. But the storyline was all around sucky and the ending was stupid. Thats all I have to say about the scary, yet cheesy movie."
1,"Don't even bother , it will bore the pants off ya !","I bought this dvd & was very disapointed with the whole film in general.The films about a young man called Donny Kohler who as a kid was abused by his mother, who latter on in life takes his revenge out on a some young ladies by leading them into his old house, then burning them to death( it's there own fault for being stupid enough to go into this house with a total stranger who ther've only known for about five minutes). I nearly feel asleep half way through this film because it's to slow. Most dvds come with some extras this doesn't come with any not even ""scene select"". If your lookin' for a good horror film stay well away from this one."
4,a creepy little gem !,Along with 'PSYCHO' & 'DERANGED' Don't go in the house(aka:the burning) is another creepy & demented take on the abused mama's boy gone severely wrong issue(Ed Gein style) & is in my opinion a disrespected & over-looked classic that doesn't rip Hitchcocks Psycho off as much as it shares a similar study in subject. This is a spooky film & does stand out on its own in my eye's! *WARNING* I do believe amazon.com has got the cover art for the 1998 LTD version mixed up with the cover art for the 2005 Shriek Show version & Shriek Show is i believe the most complete version(i could be wrong?)
1,Low budget horror flick with an awful DVD transfer,"This a low budget horror film with Dan Grimaldi starring as a guy who takes the women who he meets to his large old house and burns them in a metal room. Similar to Hitchcock's Psycho in ways with the house looking similar, but it doesn't deserve to be mentioned at all in association with that classic film. It is cheap and trashy, but also unintentionally amusing at times. If you like low budget slaher flicks check it out. I have to say though the DVD transfer is terrible. Forget any extras, it doesn't even have a menu, the film immediately begins when you insert the disc, and there is only two chapters, which means you have to search through half the film to find a particular scene. A very poor effort. The rating of one star is for the DVD."
1,Don't go in the house,This movie is not what you think. If you like horror films then this is not for you it was boring from start to finish. And stupid just rent it and even that would be a waste of money.
1,Too bad I can't give a zero rating,"Probably the worst movie that I ever saw. I caught this back in '81 when it first escaped into theaters. If you want to see women set on fire, then this is the movie for you. Not one redeeming feature as as I recall."
1,Zero Stars?,"I cannot believe what passes for entertainment, and this makes people write paragraph after paragraph of thoughtful comments!!!I saw this and it was horrible!What's next that's so interesting? A movie where a kid goes outside and burns ants with a magnifying glass?Where have you guys been? Come up to present time. Rent some good horror that's interesting."
3,Disco Inferno,"Forgotten bit of early 80s horror nastiness overcomes its more graphic and mysogynistic elements thanks to a loopy performance by Dan Grimaldi (The Sopranos) and a wonderfully cheesy disco soundtrack. Watch as Grimaldi celebrates his evil mother's passing by playing his disco records REALLY loud. Truly a product of its time, Don't Go In the House ranks alongside William Lustig's Maniac in the sleazy slasher department. A guilty pleasure to be sure."
3,better then most of the late-70's schlock,"already a good case against this flick as it falls within the rash of knock-off ""don't answer/look/open"" movies which hit the scene in the late '70's - but this movie actually holds its own with some considerable sickness and a generally depraved attitude. The lead character doesn't smile once through the whole flick and hardly winces as he torches poor girls in his custom-made incinerator. Not much gore unfortunately other than some burnt bodies but this film is so humorless it makes up for the lack of grue in its mean-spiritedness. A kid abused by his mom (over the range-top burners of course) grows up to obsess about her (a la Psycho) and then take his revenge out against the innocent. A couple good jumps here and there - all in all a quality flick. Probably would have given it 4 stars but the DVD has absolutely nothing in the way of extras: full-screen, 2 (!) chapters, and thats it."
3,Psycho type thriller,"This movie is a lot like Hitchcock's Psycho. The basic principles are the same, but the characters and death scenes are very different. The main character has some very deep ""mother"" issues that need professional help. This guy actually plans his murders in advance which is unlike the Norman Bates character in Psycho. I like this movie and would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate 70's & 80's horror films."
3,Not for dummies,"I was expecting something that could truly teach a beginner to brew. If I ever figure it out I think I will have to write my own book as this one was just overwhelming. Also, unlike most dummies books it wasn't very fun to read. After reading this book I lost the urge to try homebrewing. Perhaps if I had a higher IQ or photographic memory I could take it all in but, I just couldn't."
5,This book is the best homebrewing book on the market.,"Whether you are a novice, intermediate, or advanced homebrewer, you should purchase this book. It is well written, and I refer to it more than all my other homebrewing books combined. This book is by far the best homebrewing book on the market."
4,I am pleasantly supprised... and a bit tipsy,"I read this book cover to cover (took me about a week) before I started brewing. I bought the right equipment, and followed the instructions in the book. Now, three weeks after brewing and four weeks after purchasing the book, I have some pretty good homemade bottled beer!Brewing is not for the impatient, but the author makes that clear. This book is very easy to follow. You don't have to read the whole thing. Some of the chapters are for people who are pretty advanced in the hobby."
2,"Good on paper, not in practice","In order for these well-thought-out, simple guidelines to work, you have to be involved in a professional atmosphere in which negotiation is possible. The guidance and counsel offered in this book simply will NOT work with, say, a micromanager hung up on getting things done HIS way or no way at all. I have loaned this book to several co-workers who have concluded the same.If your work place is open to professional input and ideas for improvement (even where office politics run rampant), the book might work. But if your work place is run by an aggressive, incurable micromanager (who continues to deny that he is one) your money might be better spent in, say, therapy."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Ginny Pearson Barnes’ book declares that negotiations should not be wars of attrition or clashes of egos. Instead, they should be mutually beneficial dialogues that involve an open exchange of ideas, mutual respect and a celebration of differences. Sound a little simplistic? Perhaps. But the book is crisply written and covers all the points that one would expect: determining which side of a negotiation holds the power, using body language to your advantage and crafting fall-back positions. While some of Barnes’ advice, like finding satisfaction in defeat, will sound a bit trite to hardened negotiators, she does present some interesting bargaining-table techniques, including some innovative ways to derail a domineering opponent. Nevertheless, veterans of hard-fought deliberations likely will find Successful Negotiating a bit soft in detail, so we [ ...] recommend the book to rookie negotiators who want to know what to expect when they step into the smoke-filled room."
1,item never arrived,The item never arrived. There was no tracking info for the package. 4 weeks went by since order and I gave up. The seller responded to my inquiry and I was fortunately able to get a refund for the product.
4,good,"This is a good book but as most medical school classes one has to use more than one book. Barr's is another good choice, but Nolte's has better pictures."
3,Collectorama,"Former wife of guitar legend Richard Thompson, and ace singer in her own right, Linda Thompson's Give Me a Sad Song is a companion piece of sorts to Hannibal's 1996 collection Dreams Fly Away. Neither compilation captures Thompson's best. Both are baited with collectorama and `previously unreleased's'. Give Me a Sad Song is not the place to start for the Thompson novice, yet it does showcase a natural talent deepening her already impressive contralto on folk tales, cover songs, sung poems, etc. Her version of Lucinda Williams' ""Abandoned"" is top notch, and her phrasing on ""Her Father Was a Sailor"" shows the vocal chops of a simple interpreter before the producer drowns her in echo. Thompson's voice is a pure instrument. It hardly needs studio trickery. If you want to hear an interpretive artist in full bloom (and hear the most damning divorce record ever made), get Richard and Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the Lights. If you're already a fan, here's another CD for your shelves."
3,"Pretty good, but not a first purchase for this artist.","First off, anything by Linda Thompson qualifies as a must-get, IMHO. So why only three stars? In the sliding scale of LT albums, ""Dreams Fly Away"" and ""Fashionably Late"" are the fives, ""One Clear Moment"" is a four, and this is the three, and the the order of purchase should be roughly the same, though if you can't find ""Moment"" then by all means snatch this one up and don't wait for the queue.It's all a matter of recording quality, really. The songs on ""Give Me a Sad Song"" are generally demos, and it does show, nowhere more than in the often muddy recordings. Sometimes the session musician backup is also less than stellar. Compare that with the other LT compilation, ""Dreams"" which holds up both as an album of songs, and an overview. Anyone purchasing this album should know this, and understand that they are getting an outake-quality disc. Again, only a rating for the average consumer. If you are a fan of Linda Thompson, go for it!"
5,Yellowjackets Do It Again!,"The Yellowjackets never disappoint. This Christmas jazz CD is excellent from beginning to end.. no filler. It is a little on the mellow side but is still top notch. I have many Christmas jazz CDs, and this one is in the top three."
5,DINO-RRIFIC for Kids!,This is an excellent book on dinosaurs for the pre-school/Kindergarten and early/new-readers age groups. Pre-schoolers and Kindergarteners will enjoy it for the pictures. Children new to reading will like the large type and relatively simple sentences. I highly recommend the hardback version because I am replacing a paper-back that has received lots of use.
5,Tennessee Folklore History Characters,"A number of stories (some based on folklore, some historical) compiled by the author from extensive visits throughout the state. Stories of colorful figures and accounts of geographical interest."
2,The idiot may be yourself,"It does not take too long when reading this book to realize there is only one idiot in the sales process and that person is likely you , not the customer. A decent job of revisiting the basics that get forgotten. I appreciated their take on the different personalities of customers. They use these categories:* Machiavellian* Sadist* Masochist* Paranoid* Greek Gods* Best Buddy* Decent SoulsQuite hilarious but I am sure we have met all these types in our day Using these personlaity types the authors lead you through understanding their i-story, and how to talk to them during each of the 12 steps:1. Be prepared or be the idiot2. Connect3. Confuse with clarity4. matching5. Showtime6. Ask for the business7. Circle again8. ask again9. Appreciate10. Referral11. Follow-up12. PractiseNot a heavy read and decent for a 3 hr plane ride. Good motivating language."
1,not worth the price,"There's a couple of good stories, good writers in here, but not many. And this isn't the second ever 'sequel' to Aqua Erotica, as they say - I know there's a book called ""Wet"" that apparently was so lousy they're trying to ignore it or something. I'm not sure what she's going for with this book, it's not water stories, or j hot stories, it's just a mish-mash of not very original or interesting work. Avoid this one, there's so many better erotica anthologies out there."
2,Disingenuous,"The advertisement as the sequel of Aqua Erotica 1 is completely misleading. While there is erotica in the book, it is not water related and instead is a myriad of other kinks and pleasures. The stories are rather flat and a bit on the boring side, but the book is waterproof."
1,Avoid,"The caps Grip tight, which pull off the point ends, which haveto be stuck back into the pens, which annoys the hell out of me.The pen writes fine - and if you don't mind re-assemblingone every time you are about to write, highly recommended!"
2,pulls apart when you take the cap off,"While the actual ink part is great, if you put the cap on and then take it off, the cap doesn't let go and the pen pulls apart. Its really a pain."
3,To the Victor The Spoils,"Pros: The first book I've read that actually tells the stories of the man in the trenches / front lines. The daily grind of their existence, shortages, and fears.How do you take a minute for 'normal bodily functions' when under fire, while dealing with the death and destruction of the front line 'grunt' of any army.Great book for Veteran's families to read; with the proviso that not all combatants experienced the same situations.Con: print is a bit small for my old eyes.jmp"
2,Needed To Be More In-Depth,"This book was weakly written. I've read plenty of MacArthur's books, and was severely disappointed in this one. I know he could have done better. Its brevity and lack of substance clearly represented the publisher's attempt at a quick buck. A weighty subject of this nature deserves more than that!"
1,rapture truth revealed,"It is sad indeed when educated scholars preach of a pre trib rapture that was invented by the Catholic church (look it up) when the truth is that yes Christ is returning for a second time...""in that day"" every eye will see Him, with a large trumpet blast etc...at the very last day, not a second sooner...there will not be a third coming....I'm disappointed to say the least."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PROGRAM,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. BUGS & POOR SUPPORT IS WHAT YOU WILL GETStay away from ALL Sonic Solutions products. Get Ulead Systems DVD Workshop 2 instead
2,Full of bugs. A piece of junk.,It is hard to believe that this is version 5.2 of Sonic MyDVD. I say that because: How could you get to such a high version number and still have such a buggy product with such ugly menus? The only thing that you probably want this program to do is to make a menu for your DVD. Unforturnately it is even bad at that. Sometimes you can't change the labels under the buttons -- you click on the text in edit mode and nothing happens. The buttons are always stuck in the same place. Often the button label (text) overlaps a button in a way that looks like an error. This also looks like a bug to me: If you try to change the label on the first chapter button the program also changes the menu title of the DVD. Huh? You will waste hours of your time. Even at this low price you should expect much better.
1,Full of bugs. Not worth the time wasted.,I have used MyDVD 5.0 and 5.2 for the past 8 months. The program is full of bugs. Support is virtually non existent. Web site only wants to SELL you upgrades to fix known bugs.You will waste valuable hours of you time (as well as money) if you buy this program
1,"Sonic MYDVD was free for me, and I would give it back if I could","I got the Sonic software pre-loaded onto my laptop, and frankly it is not worth the space that it consumes on my hard drive. I have attempted to burn a DVD 4 seperate times. 2 times I have been successful, 2 times I have received errors.It is painfully slow (expect about a 4 hour burn time for one hour of DVD play time), and it completely locks up your machine for that time period. Start it up, let it run, and take a nap.Perhaps the most painful part is that on my two failed attempts, the errors that eventually shut down the whole process didn't happen until hour number 3 of the burn process. Ahhh, good times."
3,Heavy Metal Aircraft Carrier,"This item was a gift for my father. He enjoyed the movie very much, but I have not seen it."
5,GIVE KUDOS TO WHATEVER MERITS IT,"There is hardly anything about Windows XP that you will not find in this Deluxe Edition of ""Microsoft Windows XP Inside Out"". The simplicity of this book's contents is commendable. Even Windows first-timers will adapt with ease; and advanced users may use its 1500 pages as an authoritative reference. From installation and configuration to multimedia and networking (including Service Pack 1), the book took care of both Professional and Home editions of Windows XP. The attached CD-ROM enables mobile users to leave the heavy book at home while on the move without missing a thing. It is hard to find a major weakness on either the book or on its accompanying CD-ROM."
5,Great Book and Coverage,"For those that buy technical books to learn about and understand a technical topic in depth, it is rare that you can find such a book. However, ""Microsoft Windows Xp Inside and Out,"" fills the bill.This text is well written and is very thorough (I have not finished yet, but am sure the rest of the book will be as excellent as what I have read so far.)Experienced Windows OS users will find this a real jewel, as attested to by other reviewers. Inexperienced viewers, however, are likely to find this book rather dense and may want to start out with other books."
5,A must read....,"When I first saw the new XP design I have to admit that I hated it, I've since changed my opinion. I've been using it now for over 3 months and with the help of this book I've been able to get a lot from the new operating system. There's is so much that is new to XP that it's worth it to read up on. Trying to find this information in the tons of XP websites out there can be a real pain. This book includes all that you need to know to get the most from Microsoft's new offering."
5,Solved My Problem,I've had my book for about a week and it kept me from going crazy today. My Google toolbar disappeared and I use it A LOT.Page 430 told me what I had to do to get it back. (Troubleshooting: Internet Explorer displays third-party toolbars incorrectly.)
4,Great Reasource,I use this book 3-4 times a week. It is a good tool in my opinion as it put things in a realworld perspective. If you ever read any of the Microsoft press books you'll know that it is all put in to a plain Vanilla way and most IT business aren;t plain or Vanilla. This book is great to have.
4,Microsoft Windows XP,"This book has so much information. It is actually more than we need in our household, but would be helpful to anyone who uses the computer for all things. S.Robertson"
3,"Tons of information, but hit and miss.","The book covers a ton of information and is usually excellent for reference. However, every now and then there is a subject that is thin. Backups is a good example. Such an important part of the system and there are only a few pages on the topic."
3,"Big & heavy, not terribly useful","You pretty much get what you'd expect out of this 1300-page book: lots of screenshots, lots of handholding, and very little substance. Want to learn how to navigate menus? Open notepad? Win at Solitaire? No problem.Want to stop Windows from crashing? Want to get your digital camera to work? Want to hook up a network? Want to make your computer faster? Well, you'd be out of luck. There are much better XP books than this one, especially if you actually want to use it for more than a doorstop. But if you judge reference books by their pound-per-dollar ratio, then you'll like this one."
2,"Weak effort; lots of pages, little detail","If you're looking for a phonebook-sized volume with the words ""Windows XP"" printed on the cover, this one is for you. But there are more focused, more detailed, and far more useful books out there. Don't let all the shill reviews here fool you; Windows XP Inside/Out is yet another weak Microsoft in-house effort, used as nothing more than a pretense and an excuse at the lack of real support from this software behemoth. 1300 pages of you-probably-already-know-this information, and virtually no substantial coverage of the registry, scripting, networking, or security. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
2,Authors Know Just Enough To Be Dangerous,"With any technical book that has 1435 pages, you have to give the author(s) an ""A"" for effort. However, my experience has been that whenever I have an XP question, I can get a faster and better answer on the Google Newsgroups.I do have a more serious complaint about this book, though. While reading it, I stumbled acrossed a section on installing dual-boot system. The authors detailed all of the advantages, but failed to mention that once you do this you can't get rid of it. The system files wind up on one OS and the boot files wind up on another. Now I just have to live with the situation or reformat and start over. This problem is one of the most discussed XP problems on the newsgroups and was documented well before the book was published.I would have been much better off if I had never bought the book. My advice: Buy a smaller and cheaper book if you are a beginner and get your info off the newsgroups if you are more advanced."
3,More for intermediate user then a power user,Some reviewers have said this book is for Power users. I would disagree. This is more for intermediate users that don't want to seriously get under the hood. It is a large book and there is a lot in it. But the book does not go into the nuts and bolts binary details of XP. I wanted a book that explain the full guts of XP. There are a lot of undocumented features and programs that let you control the true inner guts of XP. One example is the SC program to control the NT service controller. Another thing would be a detailed explination of all the services that come with windows xp.For users who don't want to speak binary this is a decent book. Just keep in mind it's a Microsoft Press book. It's not going to cover the things that Microsoft doesn't want you fooling with.
1,The Perfect Doorstop,This book is unreadable for the non technical person. I am praying someone gives me Windows XP for Dummies for Christmas. I can't make out the index and I can't find a command equivalent to the alt-ctrl-delete when the program is hung up. It is just not for me.
2,If you're not a nerd yet .......,This was soooo difficult for me to follow. Every question I had did not seem to be in there or maybe I just did not ask it right. Big waste of MY MONEY.
1,need separate books for home and professional editions,need separate books for home and professional XP
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!,"I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to get up to speed on windows XP Pro and Home Edtions. The book is lets you know at the beginning of each section what applys and does not apply to Home edtion. I consider myself at or close to the Intermediate level. Did some thinking on whether this book was would be useful, the review here were mixed. I'M SURE GLAD I BOUGHT THIS BOOK!!!!! I just bought and installed Windows XP pro, and this book has given me useful insite, tips, and help on issues that have come up. I would recommend you read the section on installing Windows XP before you install. This book not going to cover everyhting you need to know, but i do not think that was its intention."
3,"Very dry, don't use it much","This is so dry that I haven't pulled it out much. Given how much Windows XP has evolved, I find it more useful to Google for specific problems rather than refer to a printed reference guide.Folks who do troubleshooting might find a subscription to Experts Exchange (disclosure--I'm an Expert there) more cost-effective than buying a book like this for reference purposes.On the other hand, if you are studying for an A+ certification or something similar, you might find this very useful."
3,Too Old,"regretfully, at age 87-years, this item is a bit too filled with current electronic wordstock for me to use to learn how to use the computer my quite bright daughter selected for me!"
4,Awakens the soul within,"Janet Lim is simply amazing, having survived the horrific tragedy that befell her. A glimpse of China to witness the prejudices against baby girls, slavery in various forms, kind missionaries ( to show how important education is), trustworthy friends, values and beliefs, Japanese occupation in Asia and the list goes on. Janet Lim is an optimist in every sense of the word."
2,Don't go cheap !,These forks are NOT heavy..they are light and really rough around the edges. I would opt for a more expensive set next time.
1,NOT HEAVY WEIGHT AT ALL!!,"Was looking for some type of heavy weight forks. What I got was lightweight, thin, forks not at all what I expected. Next time I will go in person to get any flatware and not depend on what is listed by some sales staff to sell their items."
2,Pictures can deceive,"Definately a Euro type short boot, the pictures can mislead you to think of it as round cap like the old discontinued Kenneth Cole NYs of yesteryear. Sides are a bit narrow for wide feet and the sole, although styled in the traditional tan of an Italian leather sole, is truly rubber to the eyes, ears, and touch. It's cheap though, so it's just one of those shoes you can wear while in a crowded area and not worry about everyone stepping on your shoes."
4,Great BUy !!!!,I bought this shoe ..Just to try and save some cash and figure i only would be wearing the shoe on the weekend anyway ...It turns out its a better shoe then i thought. I buy alot of Kenneth Cole products and this one looks and feels better then the shoe i bought from NORDSTORMS 3 YEARS AGO FOR $160.00 ..KEN -THE HAPPY CUSTOMER
1,Pass this one up.,"If this is an example of humor, it doesn't bode well for Love Spells new humor line. I found myself on page 200 and still hadn't gotten into the story line. I never did! The hero is an MCP extraordinaire, his brothers a bunch of ignorant bumpkins, I just cant believe that a 20th century professoress could ever find a redeeming quality in these 19th century bunglers. Very disappointing read."
1,"Good premise, flat writing.","I was dissapointed in this novel. For such a cute premise this book was sorely lacking. Parts that were supposed to be humorous were poorly written and lacked spark. The hero was an alpha boor. The only engaging characater was Ma Recklaw and she wasn't interesting enough for me to finish the book. I couldn't get past page fifty. If you want to read a humourous book, read the ""Reluctant Viking"" or save your money for other reads. Overall a dissapointment."
2,Could have been better!,"It was a cute idea that could have taken off but never made it to the runway. I found it hard to believe that the main character, as educated as she was, could put up with being referred to as ""woman"" and ""female"" all the time. Why can't authors refrain from using words with such derogatory implications. I was disapointed."
5,What you would expect.,"I needed this book for my science olympiad team. It is exactly what you would expect from the Audubon society. Great colors, good quality, great examples. I ordered many other field guides at the suggestion from other teachers."
4,Good for a geologist or mineralogy student,"Got this to help with mineralogy and field geology classes when I don't have access to the internet. Works great if you know basic mineralogy, crystallography, etc. If your'e a novice rock-hound, I would recommend something else? although not sure there is much out there that can really get more basic without being too basic and therefore unreliable, similar to a field guide to plants- you need to know the key concepts of what you're looking for or you'll be lost with or without a guide. The photo section is great but only shows specimens with ideal crystallization, not really what is typically encountered in the field so don't expect it to be of much use in identifying samples properly.Also, the pages (other than the photo section in the middle) are waaay thin and rip easily, like newspaper, i would gladly pay more for a more durable version for serious field use/reference."
5,Great Gift for Dad!,I bought this as a gift for my Dad who loves rocks and minerals. He has been enjoying it very much!
4,Nice pictures,"This is a nice compact field guide. There is more technical stuff than this beginer can appreciate for now. The only complaint came from my geology major daughter - ""the pictures only depict the crystal forms, you almost never see such good specimens"".I told her to be more optimistic about finding similar examples."
4,an important book in any naturalist's library,"As with all the Audubon guides, the glossy photographs; durable binding and leatherette cover; and cross-referencing the index via the color plates, are what make these guides important.This rock field guide has a good glossary of terms that is helpful. Also, there are identification keys for color, fabric, and hardness of specimens, along with descriptions indicating areas to locate them.Unlike the animal and plant field guides, this one hasn't gone out of date like the others. However, the deficencies still apply: the details are pretty general, and the summaries are ridiculously short. Still, this book is one of the best in the series and should be on anyone's shelf that has even a passing interest in geology.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"
4,NAS Field Guide to NA Rocks & Minerals,"For the content it is very concise and informative. Only a larger, more-detailed resource would be better but that would also be much more expensive - this was a great value!"
5,Rockhound's bible,"This book is a must have for any experienced rockhound. The field guide sorts mineral specimens by color and then further subdivides them by crystal habit. The color plates are nicely photographed and direct the reader to the corresponding pages which contain all the mineralogic characteristics of the specimens. All the information a rockhound could possibly desire, including North American collecting locales is contained within.This would not be a suitable book for a beginner in the field as the retrieval of information would not be easily done by a novice. As a long time serious collector, despite the approximately 800 pages, many popular minerals have been omitted."
2,Not the best out there...,"Most Audubon Field Guides that I have seen have greats amount of detal, as does this one, but a necesssity in identification of rocks and minerals is to be able to see the picture while you read the data to compare what you see, and as this book has them separte, it makes it very difficult to use when you need to reference material quick. A good book for details, though and the pictures ARE pretty, but as a student who really likes minerals, I'd have to say Simon and Schuster is a better book for the field or lab."
3,"good, but......","We purchased this field guide based on other great reviews. Although it it very thorough.....it is thorough about minerals. 2/3 of the book is about minerals. We wanted to know more about ROCKS. If you love minerals, then this is the guide for you. If you are a rock lover....keep looking."
2,yawn...,"By the reviews I thought this book would be so good. It was rather boring. I love Regency Romances. But there were way too many unexplained things here.His first wife: The whole thing with that was just really unbelievable. He fell in love with a picture of the heroine?How and when did these two even fall in love? They didn't even know each other. They met three times. Three short times before he told her he loved her! And they kept seeing each other in their minds making love.Then suddenly they're planning their wedding...Wait, when did she say yes? When did he even ask?It's true, there was a lot of history in this novel, and that's one of the reasons it was boring.And, maybe it's me, but I thought some of these characters were a little too oblivious.Though I will say one thing. Sandra Heath can describe a scene like no other. Lovely writing."
1,Not what expected,This is much smaller than expected. It looks bigger and more major on the picture but really it is not like that.
2,It's okay,"This little fire boat is okay. I'm a little disappointed because when it fills up with too much water the boat doesn't float. Also the squirting doesn't work very well. My son does like fireman Felix quite a bit and loves playing with him. Not a bad toy, just not a great one."
3,Waterlogged Fire Boat,Cute idea and nice construction. You have to prime it with water to make it squirt but the whole rear end sinks and the jets are under water. Also you have to keep the bottom in the water in order for it to keep loading water while you try to squirt it. Kinda tricky for a two year old. Not much fun because when you hold it just right you can't aim the water jet at anything.
3,Will last for years.,"I became a fan of WOW toys a year ago and generally, this is no exception. It's durable like other WOW toys and will last for years but my only problem is the boat takes on too much water while in the tub. Even minor movements by my kids turns this boat over and it starts listing. That said, they love the side water sprays and even the little fireman floats."
1,four words,It's a comic book.This book was very disappointing. I had watched the movie and thought that I could get more insight by reading the book...I think that I was done in 10 minutes reading... Terrible to even market this as a book.
1,"Leave the book, take the movie","I saw the film first and usually in an adaptation, there are things that are naturally lost such as internal thoughts. And so I read it with the idea that there would be nuances and depth that couldn't be caught on film. Instead of juxtaposing the killers actions against lazily checking out of a motel, Wagner just has them shoot down two kids. Yawn! And instead of the vast improvement Cronenberg took in making Tom's character a dangerous man, the novel's Tom is the good guy who got mixed up in a bad scene because of his allegiance to a friend. YAWN! All the other characters in the novel, including Tom, come across as uninteresting and wooden, the family adding no conflict to Tom's dilemma. All in all, a tepid, uninteresting, too long story gratefully remedied by an excellent film."
3,Great art,"I am a huge fan of minimalist pen and ink art so this book was a treat in that regard. While the overall plot idea is good, I wasn't impressed with the writing. The art was good enough to keep me engrossed but a lot of the dialogue felt cliché or just poorly-written.Keep in mind, I'm a fan of this art style. Some might find it too messy or not detailed enough or might just be off-put by the lack of color. If any of those things don't suit you then I wouldn't recommend this book. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it solely for the art."
4,From Italy to Calumet,"An Amazon search for my family's rare Italian surname turned up a brief mention in this book, and when I realized the reference was to my great grandfather who immigrated to the Lake Superior Copper Mines in 1907 from near Turin, Italy, I decided to order it. Knowing little of the story of my ancestors, it helped paint a picture of what life was like in the years following their arrival in Keweenaw Peninsula. And for that I am grateful to Lankton.My favorite parts of the book are those that provide social context to what life was like in the mining communities, as well as those passages on the struggle between labor and management. Imagining Italians, Finns, Austrians, Irish, Germans and Cornish workers ""fresh off the boat"" working, living, organizing side by side in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 100-150 years ago is fascinating."
3,The book was pertinent to my interests in the region.,"The well-researched history of the Copper Country region during the prime years of mining provided insights that were of personal interest to me. My grandfather worked at the largest copper mine, Calumet and Hecla, before he died in 1919. Of course, there are still unanswered questions which I will have to pursue elsewhere but this book included a great deal of social and industrial information.. Other relatives worked in the mines early in this century but no one now living could provide the details offered in Cradle to Grave."
5,Excellent,"Great vocals, great chemistry, and really powerful lyrics. Seeing them live only enhances the experience..they are just as good out of the studio. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes rock."
5,The Best!,"Mark Wirtz is a magician; a song wizard. His genius will touch you, change you and renew your faith in music's ability to heal, unify and strengthen us."
2,Cheap :(,"Very cheaply made.The handle arrived loose. One of the rivets wasn't even attached when I opened the box, and was rattling around. Rivets are normally extremely durable so this doesn't bode well.The metal is overly thick and very heavy, yet, has a dull ring so it seems soft and I expect it will not be as durable as thinner, higher quality steel."
4,Works well but quickly becomes loose,"I purchased this spatula for use on a residential 24"" gas griddle. It works quite well and I am pleased with the overall use. The only concern is the rivets become quite loose after only a few uses.Would have liked to see the wood on the handle sealed or protected in some way. Not a deal breaker for me."
5,great value and sturdy,Cheap but well made. Heavy gauge metal for smashing burgers and lifting heavy meats it doesn't bend like so many spatulas I have bought in the past. This one is well made. I highly recommend it.
3,"Extra-Large 16in long, grill spatula, turner spatula,Barbecue BBQ spatula, w/cutting Edge, solid stainless steel","The stainless steel construction is great, it has all the surface you need to handle just about anything on the grill. The only issue I have with the spatula is the rivets on the handle, mine arrived with a loose handle. I fear with prolonged use this will be a problem. Overall nice spatula for the price."
5,Large enough to turn a 2lb meatloaf...,"...if that's your fancy! I use it a couple times a week with roasts and/or large steaks. When tongs just wont cut it, I reach for this. Thankfully, it's as sturdy as it is huge!"
4,Nice product,This is a great high quality product. I bought for my husband who loves to cook and he was absolutely pleased with the size and quality of this spatula
2,Several fruit based liquors to make in your home.,"Althought there were 50 recipes, they were very similar, just with different fruits. An addition to a liquor recipe collection but not for the beginner recipe collector."
2,Not very good,"Not are the recepies similar to each other, most of them are not very good. Grapefruit - excellent Rosmary - OK Tangerine Brandy - Ghastly Better books are available."
5,A wonderful book and evocation of time,"I just recently re-read this book by Jong, and honestly I liked it more than when I first picked it up over a decade ago - and I loved it then. Just such a rich evocation of time and place, and she nails the emotional turmoil of those years with a grace that is hard to explain, let alone write eloquently about. Highly recommended!"
2,Boy-Crazy Embarrassment,"I first read this book around 20 years ago. I remembered it as being mildly amusing but I was unprepared for how embarrassing and silly it seems today. I am also baffled by why Jong was so lionized as a feminist and thinker at the time. It reads more like something a giddy teenager would write and the author is so obsessed with sex she makes Portnoy look like a monk. It gets very boring very quickly. Occasionally she throws in some literary reference or makes a social observation but it's drowned in all the bedroom action. Most of these musings are rather sophomoric, and hardly pass for something deep or insightful.She should have quit after ""Fear of Flying."""
1,you gotta be kidding,"I am flabberghasted at the praise heaped on this book. Fear of Flying at least makes an attempt toward self-realization, but this book absolutely wallows in ""Isadora""'s self-congratulatory naughtiness. Even worse are Jong's utterly banal feminist musings on the class system, poetry, and, oh hell, just about everything else. Erica, nobody cares."
4,social context,"The previous reviewer missed the point. Criminological theory should be studied with an appreciation of the social context (i.e., history) in which the theories were developed and extended."
3,"THIS BOOK IS A HARD READ, BUT HAS SOME GOOD INFO","This book is a hard read. It is chockfull of historical research into the contexts of how different theorists came up with criminological theories. It covers control, conflict, and other theories, with an interesting section on feminine crime... This book is very convolluted and hard to follow at times, jumping back and forth between history and theorists...it needs to be made more clear and concise, and to make up whether it wants to be a book of theory or history. Also, the slanted views of the writers in favor of conflict theories is too obvious. Also, it should be used more for graduate study than undergraduate. If you have the time to decipher it, it has some interesting information in it. It is a small book, and perhaps this is why some of the theories were glazed over with little explanation or practical reviews. It is a decent book, but it should be made more accessible to the non-expert mind."
1,They sent me the wrong edition,I would not buy from this seller. I got the wrong item. The book says 5th edition and he gave me the 4th edition and now for my class the page numbers are all off and I most likely will have to buy a new book.
2,Buy GRE for Dummies instead of this.,"This book was, for the most part, a waste of time and money. The computer software contained errors and did not look like the actual test (fractions, for example, were written on this software in a difficult-to-decipher format). The test-taking strategies in this are not useful, and the instructional sections are more time consuming and less helpful than in GRE for Dummies. The only things this book is useful for are additional practice tests and lists of word roots."
2,inaccurate model exams,"Many of the questions from this book's model exams contain errors. Other questions are not blatantly incorrect, but are pretty odd. I prefer Kaplan's book. The only clear reason to prefer this book is its long vocabulary list."
2,Not very helpful,"I am so dissapointed the a chose to by Barron's GRE prep book. It makes math pproblems seem more complex and difficult than they actually are. I was given the Princeton Review 1998 edition and it explained the math much better. I was able to comprehend the math questions easily. Barron's book may be helpful for vocab. I am actually seraching for a new book. I have wasted three weeks studying Barron's book. I have three weeks to take my GRE's and I have to find something else. Just be careful to really look over the book before you buy it because it was a waste a money for me, but it may not be for you."
5,Bo ok is highly usefull to everybody,I am an Er.and want to start my reserch at usa university.so I am interested to write gre
4,Just my style,These salt and pepper shakers are pleasing to look at. They function just as any shaker would. I made little pockets on my napkin basket for them.
2,Is This Chic Lit???,"Has it finally happened? Am I just too old for some authors now... I am 50 (ouch)... could it be that I am not cool enough for this type of thing? I really wanted to enjoy this...but this young womans voice did not resonate with me...the ""secret"" was totally ridiculous...such a talented writer but a really irritating book."
2,The Brambles,"The author is more interested in colorful, poetic descriptions thanin telling an interesting story.You lose any desire to see what happens to these people because they are SO boring and self centered.I got the feeling that the author was her tormented Edie character.This is a cure for insomnia."
2,Ummmmm....it was ok,I guess I was expecting more from this book. The book club I'm in all agreed that they found it hard to keep reading but they pushed through it. The author jumped around too much which took away from the book.
2,Rambles of the Brambles,"OMG!! Did this author OD on speed or something. This is just a free flow of thoughts and makes no sense. Here's a good example, a new character (of which there are a million) has a one line comment, then the author goes on a 13 page tangent that as about 4 different stories going on, and then comes back to the new character and you're supposed to remember who the heck it is. I have never read such a mess before. I was hoping to use this for my book review column - but i can't recommend this book to anyone. Sorry, Minot."
5,A great read for anyone who struggled in their father/daughter relationship,"I loved this book. It made me laugh as well as cry. I think those who had struggles with their own father will identify with this book the main character. Any book that makes me think long after I have finished reading it, is a good read in my mind."
3,A good intro but not great,"I'm using this book as a text for an OO technologies graduate course, and while the book does indeed offer a good intro to the topic, it certainly has room for improvement. There are several errors and inconsistencies in the notation and examples. The book is based on UML 1.0, making it somewhat dated. I felt uneasy about many of the examples offered; many times they didn't seem to illustrate the language feature all that well. I find that I use the UML Notation Guide more so than this text. And the included Ration Rose trial version crashes with great regularity on a Win95 machine."
2,"Starts off good, but disintegrates into poorly related ideas","I was expecting much from the reviews, but felt as I moved into the fifth chapter that the coherence of the presentation and thematic development was falling apart. I found it became too confusing for me given the time I have to study this."
3,Basic Introduction,"This book offers a good overall understanding of the UML. However the examples are shallow, and not necessarily on point or real world enough for me. I've read other books I would recommend before this one.If you'r new to UML this would be a good start, although it may be a bit confusing to the beginner. If you have UML experience and are looking for greater depth of knowledge, look elsewhere."
5,"excellent, readable, concise, gives good grasp of UML","Having read both Instant UML, and UML toolkit, found toolkit to add the most value in teaching fundamentals of UML design. The description of the processes, components and application to real business cases did not tax my brain too much. Instant UML much more suited as a reference book. Learning the art of designing object oriented business applications requires a robust methodology to relate business events to the OO architecture. UML provides a process flow from the use-case stage right through to the deployment stage to facilitate this process. Also a great productivity tool with DDL, C++, Java code generation functions."
5,Spaniel Training DVD,Pat Perry's approach to spaniel training will provide the beginner with a step-by-step process. It is clearly demonstrated during an actual training seminar in which experienced as well as less experienced English Springer Spaniels and their owners participated. The DVD will also be an excellent refresher for owners of experienced dogs wishing to sharpen their dogs' performance in the field by utilizing the techniques and training exercises that are explained and utilized throughout the seminar and are summarized in training notes throughout the program. The 2 disc set will be a very useful addition to any spaniel owner's training tools.
5,New to Boating (A Year Ago),"I purchased this book a year ago at a point where I knew nothing about powerboats. Reflecting back... this was a really good book in that it explains everything you want to know (and don't want to know) about purchasing a powerboat. There are entire sections dedicated to helping you decide specifically what type of powerboat you may want as well as sections dealing with boat inspections, sea trials, and techniques for purchasing.The book is well worth the money."
4,There won't be another.,"I read on another site that this was not going to be a trilogy, only two. Just finished it last night. A pretty good read, but once the US war machine got cranking, it was pretty obvious that the Americans would walk over the Japanese.The occupation of Japan is going to be far more brutal than history, after the news of the treatment of Americans in Hawaii gets out. The Japanese fleet is essentially in the same state as it historically was after Midway.The main reason there will not be another book is that so few of the main characters survived the retaking of Hawaii, particularly the Japanese. Either that, or they are tied to Hawaii; the story would not be continuing there, but deeper into the Pacific and into Japan itself. However, the taking of Japan without the A-Bomb and the fight against the insurgency if the Emperor had not been co-opted could have been interesting. A quagmire?"
4,Great book,Was a good follow up to the first one. Very accurate how the Japanese would fight to the end. Plus there are little clues of events still to come in this alternate universe.Great book!!
2,Half truths,"Speaking as someone with a BA in Japanese Studies from Berkeley, and having spent 10 years in Japan, his Japanese is full of basic errors. The ""shigataga nai"" that pops up a thousand times in the novel should be ""shikata ga nai"". Also, ""zakkennayo"" is not a common expression -- it is used only by a few uneducated rednecks. Officers would certainly not use it.In another passage, the author claims that Japanese cannot tell the difference between ""p"" and ""b"". This is not true -- Japanese have different syllabaries for them. It is the Koreans who have trouble with this difference.Also, I don't know where he got the information that the ""majority of Japanese in Hawaii are from Hiroshima"". I was born in Hiroshima, and I can tell you that very few Hiroshimans live in Hawaii, if at all. The vast majority of ""Japanese"" on Hawaii are from Okinawa. The plot could have become more interesting if he talked about tension between Okinawan-Hawaiians and mainland Japanese."
3,Snapshot In Time,"Just a snapshot in time for the characters. Left saying, ""Okay, now what?"". Happy trash reading in that fun to read, ponder someone else's ""what if"", but not as engrossing as other happy trash reading, ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"", ""The Firm"", etc. BTW, no offense meant with ""happy trash"". Have heard it called ""beach reading"" or ""brain candy"" also.For what little it is worth, has been my same impression of the three other Turtledove books I've read. But note what I say there ""three other"" as the author must have enough of a draw for me to come back to.Bottom line: many other books I would have rather read in ""End of the Beginning""'s place but so many other books that I would read after ""End of the Beginning""."
4,Good Protection,"The TuffWrapz are great protection for my kids shuffles, but the on/off switch is difficult to operate through the covering. We ended up cutting out the covering over the on/off switch so the kids could be sure the ipod was turned off. The colors are great!"
5,happy,I'm verry happy with my new HDMI super high resolution cable. It fit my ports perfect. I will tell my frends and coworkers. Thank you. Larry.
3,Missing sonata !,So with all of these reviews didn't anybody notice Sonata #31 is missing from the download ? Sound is passable and the playing style is definitely from another generation. Makes for great comparisons.
1,Sound is Terrible,"I found the sound to be so poor with the hissing that I couldn't even get past it to determine if I liked the performances. In a digital age, this level of recording should NOT be sold. Don't buy it. Despite an inexpensive price, I wish I had not."
4,Review,"Sound quality not as good as I'd hoped, but a bargain nevertheless. The variety and completeness are excellent. I'm glad that I purchased."
1,Sound Quality vs Cheap Price,"I was warned by the most critical buyer, but I couldn't believe the quality was so bad, I wasted my time downloading this, but I can't really complain about the price."
3,Comfortable as long as you wear thick socks with them...,"These are very nice-looking, and the boot is tall enough that it will not show, as your pant leg rises when sitting down. The only complaint that I have is that mine rubbed my legs really bad when I wore them, and I still have light scars on my legs, after almost a year. I only had ankle-socks on, but I would recommend wearing thick tube socks/knee length, to protect your lower-calf area. I have only worn mine a couple of times since they initially rubbed, now with thicker socks. I was disappointed in the comfort-factor, although I realize shoes need ""breaking in."" I figured the rubbed area would heal a lot faster. Please heed the sock advice, and maybe try them around home on carpeted areas, to make sure they're totally comfortable. I did only a little walking before they rubbed sores around my lower-calf area on each leg. Perhaps they just weren't the perfect fit for me."
4,Great boot for a good price,"I have the almost exact same pair in black and just love them! The leather is very soft, the heel is 2.25"", which is a nice height for work and play, and the toe is pointy but comfortable.I found these same exact boots on another shoe website for $90, so the price here can't be beat!"
3,Fits the bill but not quite accurate,"This is the ideal way to fill tires...but the gauge is not ideal for this purpose. If the dial measured up to like 80 psi it would be better but since it goes up to like 250, trying to find the difference between 29 & 32 psi is pretty difficult.After manually testing my tire afterwards, I found the gauge to be a bit lower than actual pressure."
1,terrible,"Body Ecology Liquid Stevia ConcentrateI read all the reviews before purchasing this product. i used 1 teasspoon to 1 cup sugar like there website said. totally ruined my cinnamon bread. total waste of 18.00 i paid for it. waste of time and cost of gluten free flours. extremly bitter, will never purchase again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ugh,"This had been reviewed as the best Stevia ever, so I bought it.I had been using powdered packets of Stevia called Stevita Supreme. I was using them as subs for Sweet'n Low when I cook or made a whipped concoction, and things turned out fine, with no odd tastes and comparable sweetness. But I also use liquid Sweet'n Low in iced tea and a few other things, so I wanted to try a liquid version.This Body Ecology liquid stuff is horrible with a weird taste, and weird after-tastes...nothing like Sweet'n Low or any kind of sugar for that matter. It will ruin your food!Would not buy again...ugh. Maybe it's just me, but..."
1,tastes just as bad - or worse - than artificial sweetner,I spent twenty bucks on this only to discover with the first cup of coffee that it tastes just as horrible as the worst artificial sweetener. Mega-yuck.
3,Good book but don't spend $111!,"I bought this book today (6/3/2010) in a paperback version at the gift shop in the Little Big Horn Battlefield National Monument. The wildflowers were fantastic and we wanted to be able to identify them. I spent $8.95 for the paperback version and it's fine. A few of the pictures are a bit blurry, but try taking pictures of grasses and flowers on a prairie where the wind is always blowing!While I like this book and think I will continue to use it, we found numerous flowers which were not included, and left us more frustrated than enlightened. I'm still looking for a book that will have what we saw today."
5,Great show,Consistently good writing. Great show! I would recommend this to fans of The Office and other smart comedies. You will enjoy it.
2,Tries too hard to be The Office,The acting is trite as the show tries too hard to replicate the comedic timing of The Office. Spinoffs from other shows have fared well when they adopt their own comedic identity.
1,P&R review,"It must have been either worse than bad or I have been hacked. I do not recall watching this video, so I am not able to review it. And I am not to keen on watching a TV show other than ""THE OUTER LIMITS"" of ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"" & ""WAREHOUSE 13."" So there!"
5,LOVE IT,I LOVE THIS SEASON! I wish the episodes were a little longer. But yes its a must if your a fan!
5,Fantastic Chemistry,This series has fantastic chemistry and excellent writing. The actors are all in sync and the quality of the product shows.
5,Sing Down the Moon,Sing Down the Moon is a very good book. If you like Native Americans you will love this book. It is about a tribe of Indians gettin taken from their lands and driven to a fort.
3,"""I Have My Pride...""","I Have Sworn To Marry The Girl and Marry Her I Will.""After ten long years, the Earl of Devenham had returned to wed Mary Anstey, only to find that their feelings for each other had cooled off considerable. Nevertheless, the both put on bright faces for the benefit of family and friends.But Mary's younger sister Emily saw through their masquerade. She would sacrifice anything rather than see her retiring sister married to the now haughty earl. Desperate measures were called for...a sleeping draught in Mary's ewdding-morning chocolate and Emily could don the veil and force an annulment when the trick was discovered.It was the kind of plot that could - and would - get young Emily into trouble...."
1,Mold test kit a waste of money,"After I read the reviews, i decided to purchase the kit. Now i am having the same probles as other reviewers had. They cashed my check, and I am still waiting for the results a month after the check cleared. Do not buy this kit."
3,Mold Detection Kit,Not what I expected. You have to send the samples off and pay $10 each to get any results. What a disappointment after paying $17 for the kit.
4,Easy to use,"This test kit was very easy to use. This is a good test kit to buy if you have visible mold growing and you want to know what type it is. If you want to know if there are hidden mold sources that are in the air, this is not the test kit to use. I gave this product four stars because I am not able to detect mold growing in unseen places, such as heating ducts."
1,Rip-off,This product is a rip off. You have to pay an additional fee for testing processing. Don't waste your money.
1,This is a joke,"Not only did we spend the cost to purchase this product but another $40.00 to send things off to be tested for mold and mold spores and the report came back and didn't say a dam thing, we had a mold speciality company read the report and they told us they didn't really say anything important in the report because there was no testing done for the air quality coming in or going out of the home."
5,Great Product,"I love this product, and it is so much easier to use from the jar rather than a tubeGives a lovely shine to the hair without making it greasyI would definitely recommend it to anyone"
5,Still the best,"I've used this product for many years and delighted it is still on the market. Moving to a rural area I had to find another source for Vitapointe and found it on Amazon. .Clairol Vitapoint Jar 8 oz.In my teens I had blonde hair and found this provided a lovely sheen without any greasy coating which brought out the highlights in my hair. Now I am completely ""gray"" and still find that using Vitapointe is still doing the the great job as it has for years. I still get compliments on my hair as it still has that lovely sheen. I would recommend Vitapointe to anyone who has not had satisfaction from any of the many products now on the market. A little rubbed into the just washed hair will convince you to use this product. Thanks to Clairol for keeping an excellent product available."
1,Bad Quality,"The petticoat I asked for for Christmas was full, a nice length, and above all, pretty.This was none of those. It was one layered and very flat. It isn't even the one in the picture. The one I recieved had a drawstring waist that is very uncomfortable.Do not bother buying it, as the re=stocking fee is $15. Not worth it at all."
5,Great petticoat,Perfect size and fit. My daughter and I will both be able to wear it for years to come. Thanks.
4,Great value!,"These were exactly what I was looking for, an affordable crinoline. The shipping was quick and the product exactly as described."
5,A Christmas Journey,This cd is a wonderful compilation of traditional Christmas songs as well as some original. Tony Sandate is a brilliant musician who takes the listener through A Christmas Journey.
3,Unclearly marked,"What you see in the picture is not what you get. You get ONLY the glass. You do NOT get the wall mount or fixture, which for $20 you'd think would be included...and if you have a Kichler outdoor light, it came with glass.Cutting a new piece would be $2, maybe $10 if you used super-high-end, plate stained glass..."
1,This guys are jerks.,"So, I ordered individually wrapped jell rings. I got a huge box of unwrapped rings. I called the company and sent emails. They admitted they sent the wrong product, but it has been almost a month now and still no resolution. They get a big fat zero for customer service--they sent the wrong product and have been unable to send the right one. Don't order from this company."
5,no justice,"the picture only does this shoe half its justice! i got them and they are amazing, look and feel good better than good!"
3,Mediocre.,"This was the second book in the Bombshell Series that I have read. The first, DAUGHTER OF DESTINY, I gave 2 stars because it just wasn't very good. GET BLONDIE is a little better, so I give it 3 stars. Cassie and Kane's past history together seemed like it would have made a better book."
4,"Hurrah for strong, tough chicks!","Let me say right off that I'm a fan of the Bombshell series & like the idea of strong women taking the lead in a more action-oriented story...with a touch of romance of course!The pace is quick and no-nonsense and for the most part the heroine's fate is in her own hands -- she's not wringing her hands waiting to be rescued.GET BLONDIE serves it up. It won't change your life, but it's not supposed to. It's supposed to entertain. And it does. In spades."
3,Good,"Its cheap under helmet, so ita good for the money, but little bet to thick for fit well under the helmet"
1,Good price - Terrible design,"The material is warm and the price is very good but the design is HORRIBLE. The seam is sown right in the middle so that it will rub against your chin, lips and nose (if you pull it up that far). Not comfortable at all. I bought 2 and kept one, since Daybreak has a policy of not accepting returns for items that have been opened especially those that contact the mouth, nose or ears. If I had to do it again, I would get a Turtle Fur product locally for $20 and at least be assured that the product will be comfortably to wear with the seams properly located to not irritate your skin. Very disappointed."
1,How did this get such good reviews?,"How did this get such good reviews? SO SMELLY, a real drawback for a product that is supposed to go over your face. I got the brown and it is truly the most unattractive color ever. I've never been able to bring myself to wear it but my friend used it once (during NEMO in Boston) and he did think it was pretty warm."
3,Too Bulkie,I was looking for a lighter weight balaclava to fit comfortably under mybicycle helmet. This one was not good for that....
4,works!,fits good. wears best as a base layer. would like to see a thinner version for warmer days. A much darker green would be better with outdoor work clothing. I own 6 of these for WORK-HELL.
4,G.I. Polypropylene Balaclavas - Olive Drab,"Its very warm, The color is great because I use it in my ghillie suit, I wish it had a drawstring to close the face a little bit. Overall, for the price it doesn't get much better."
5,Molino,"Excellent product. I work outdoors in the elements, it can get really cold in Northern New Jersey. Keeps you warm. Great price. Fast delivery."
4,good for my purposes,"fit perfect in my ""large"" motorcycle helmet and works well to keep the cold florida winter air from bothering the face. however, i've switched to a smaller helmet, and don't think this balaclava will work due to its thickness. guess i'll just use my ""large"" helmet for the winter with this balaclava...or buy a thinner one to use with my ""medium"" helmet, but don't think a thinner balaclava will keep me as warm as this one does."
2,It is warm....but it has issues,"I have to say it is definitely warm. I use it on the motorcycle with an open-face helmet and I can not complain about its ability to keep you warm. Comfort is another issue. The neck portion is way too short. In addition to this, and as many people have already mentioned, the seam down the middle of the thing seems as though whomever designed the thing failed to fully understand its use......"
2,"Very basic product, packs small, but irritable seam runs down the middle","I received the product quickly and with no problems.I bought it for ski mountaineering for stormy weather.When I tried it on, it fit well, able to cover my nose if needed. Seems like it will fit under my helmet.It is small and lightweight so will pack very well in a pocket or pack.As for comfort, I found the seam is very uncomfortable. It runs from the back of the neck over your head, and down the middle of your face, between your eyes. It may cause irritation. It may soften after washing. I am trying to figure out a work-around. I might have to sew some softer material along the seam to make it more comfortable. Or I may leave it alone to see how often I need it.I may also punch 2 breathing holes in it for my mouth and nose.I will update review once I have used it in cold weather."
4,Worked fine in windy Breckenridge,"Bought a couple of these in January for ski trips to Breckenridge. The shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condtion. They worked wonders on the slopes, especially during days when the winds would pound our faces. I wold have preferred a slightly more stretchable material so that I can pull down the mouth cover below my chin if needed. Otherwise, it did its job plain and simple. Looks like it will last me a while."
5,Just right,"Price lower than PX, good quality, shipped quickly. I used it yesterday, snow in NE, I'm sure I'll use it more.."
5,Great price.,Bought this to ride my motorcycle in the wintertime. Great price and does a fantastic job protecting my face during the ride.
3,Get what you pay for.,"It is not the best product but is okay for the price. Sizing is One-Size-Fits-All, but it is bigger than I would have liked. The material is good to build static while pulling it over your head.Wish I would have spent a bit more for the UnderArmor ColdGear, but will not return this since it was so cheap and will still keep me warm."
5,"For the price, it is an exellent product.","I made this purchase so that I could continue to ride my motorcycle well into the New England fall. I have ridden on the highway in the early morning when the sun has not yet risen and the temp was at around 45 degrees comfortably. I have a 3/4 helmet which does not cover my chin, yet the balaclava kept my neck and face protected from the wind. So I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this balaclava."
4,Fantasic. I couldn't put it down!!!,"As Edward Robb Ellis was writing his diary I was being born. I've often wondered what my pre-though, pre-war life was like now I know. Through the eyes of one man who's life mirrored, yet preceded, my own 30 years later. I wonder, in 1998, is ERE still alive. I hope so!!"
2,Horrible sound transfer,"I love the magic school bus adventures, but the sound on this DVD is horrible!!! It fades in and out, too loud, too soft. Otherwise a great science/entertainment series for kids. Stick to the VHS's."
4,Educational & funny,"I ordered this for my 5 yr. old son & he absolutely loves it. He keeps watching it & rewinding some of the scenes he finds funny. Personally, I never watched the TV series growing up because I didn't watch much TV (except on Saturday mornings). But if I had known this TV series was around back then, I would've watched it. I recommend this DVD to people of all ages...it's pretty entertaining. Even adults can learn from this DVD."
4,Helpful for First Timers,"I found this book to be quite helpful. It was the only book I could find on sewing fur at the time. I would recommend this book for getting started. It lists many of the different types of furs, leather, suede. Giving a solid background even if you just want to know more but don't want to sew. Somewhat outdated. But, hey the techniques work. My only wish would be for more patterns and more pictures & details with the step by step directions."
2,Not what I expected and way out of date,"I was anxious to recieve the book becasuse I was going to start a project with a recycled mink coat I had purchased. When it did arrive, I was immediately put off by the lack of detailed pictures and steps provided to execute the listed projects. I found the instructions for the projects somewhat vague and realized that a lot of revision was needed in order for anyone to be able to follow what was going on. I must say that if one does not intend to actually begin a project or make a fur garment, the book itself is an interesting read and a great reference. Another review had said that if updated the book would be a great text for students, and I would have to agree."
5,good,It's an old book so the pages are very old which I don't like too much but in general it's good. It helps. I liked it to work with different types of things.
3,"Good Name, Bad Idea","I own a few pairs of Tsubo shoes which are very comfortable and hug the curves of my feet. However, these are only semi-confortable mainly because the straps do not adjust. There is way too much airspace between my foot and the straps. Unless you have thicker feet (like the hobbits in Lord of the Rings), I would not recommend this item."
5,Raises Self Esteem in scientists,Ramon y Cajal was a wonderful scientist. As this book shows he was also a magnificent teacher as well. The advice he gives about how to pursue research are as true today as they were in his days. Every graduate student should read it and take his advice...except about what he has to say about women in chapter 6.
3,Interesting Bit of Science History,"I was given this book by a research mentor at the conclusion of a summer of undergrad research. She thought I would find the sections advising scientists to find appropriate wives amusing, and I certainly did. Cajal is certainly opinionated on this and many other subjects, and he writes well and clearly. Although the book is dated, the basic philosophy of science itself has not changed, making Cajal's insistence that young researchers question authority and trust their own abilities as timely as ever."
5,Advice on how to do research from a Nobel Prize winner,There are very few top-notch researchers who also are good at teaching others on how to do major research. This is a significant book on the characters required and the methods/process needed to conduct major research. Highly recommended for graduate students as well as young scientists.
5,profound book on christianity,"Anyone who is involved in christianity should read this book. The author does not cut corners in his presentation of death, judgement, heaven and hell. He shows what the bible, theologians and saints have said about these four subjects. The book is scary to say the least, because the author is not afraid to delve deeply into what many people do not want to hear. He writes about how the number of the saved are few, the eternity of heaven and hell, the hatred and persecutions of the devil and the visions of saints, who portray a merciful but very just God. Read the book."
5,INCREDIBLE NEW CHILDREN'S CLASSIC!,"This fanciful, charming story was written by a girl who was only 12 at the time she came up with the idea! Knowing this, it has inspired me to follow my dreams and not wait until I 'grow up.' The way Miss De Sena uses sophisticated, yet understandable language, with a colorful story, is amazing. A great read for any age, and a great inspiration!"
2,Annoying to operate,"Directions for this food processor are not clear. Unless you get the container in EXACTLY the right position, it will not operate. Truly annoying."
1,Poorly Made!,I used this processor 3 times and the handle promptly broke. Would not recommend it AT ALL!
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,"I bought this piece of junk thinking it would actually perform well.It did twice.After the third use it broke!The palstic snapped when I tried to lock the lid in place.The light wouldn't come on and the damn thing wouldn't start.Buyer beware!Invest a little more money in something that will a least,last for two years not three months or,three uses.Believe me,I am a very unsatisfied customer."
1,Low quality,"Got one of these as a wedding gift. The plastic bowl melted slightly the first time we put it in the dishwasher. From then on we washed it by hand, but it remained very difficult to get the bowl to snap correctly to the base so that the motor would run. After a few more uses, the handle broke off and ruined the pin that disengages the auto shutoff. It's unusable now, after no more than 5-10 uses."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE","Impossible to put together, poorly-designed, impossible to clean, broke after 3 uses. Probably one of the most poorly-designed products I've ever had the misfortune to work with."
3,"Ok, has some flaws though","I've had this for about a year now and it had been working perfectly fine until somehow I lost the attachemtn holder that sits in the center of the lid. But its not only that...somehow one of the ""locks"" or tabs on the lid broke, not a big deal as the lid still locks in place and runs. I just can't use the shredder without the missing piece to hold the attachment in place. Also, all three of the suction pegs have fallen out and for the life of me I cannot get them to go back in. So with just one suction peg, the processor is very difficult to lock the lid into place and unlock it because as others have mentioned to do so takes a lot of strength. The lid locks and unlocks hard. I don't recommend this product unless you like to waste money for sport!"
2,No Dough Blade - skip this one if you want to make bread...,"Received this as a gift for Christmas. After looking at the cover of the manual, I assumed there was a dough blade in this - I was wanting to make egg noodles and washed the processor in full anticipation of using it, only to be disappointed in finding that the blade didn't come with this model. This will chop adequately, but I definitely feel like I lost about half of the potential the machine could have had without the blade."
1,"Poorly designed, disfunctional.","This is unable to chop carrots without having a malfunction. The carrot gets stuck in between the blade and the circular lid over the blade. Then the carrot will just spin around and around. You have to take the lid off and remove the carrot and try all over again. Some of it will chop, but it's really irritating that it doesn't just go right through.This is more trouble than it is worth. Black and Decker should have stayed with drills."
2,Broke,"I liked this product for more than 1 year, but the plastic parts wear away and start shredding plastic into your food. Or they just break completely. I was going to buy replacement parts, but it seems like others have had this problem too, so I'll just buy a different product."
1,Horrid! Worked once!,I took this out of the box and used it once to shred cheese. Did not even work for one block of cheese. Really an awful product! This is my 2nd Black and Decker Food Processor in 5 months. I would recommend staying away from Black and Decker Food Processors!
1,A piece of Junk,The mouth of the 10 cup broke after using it for several use times. The plastic control panel cover wear off easily. Dont buy this product.
1,Broke while shredding cheese,"On the second time I used it, shredding cheese, something in the motor area broke and it will not work any longer. Unfortunately I bought it two or three months ago so any warranty is likely ended.Do not buy this machine."
1,Piece of Junk,"This processor is a faulty design in the locking mechanism and fragile locking tabs. Motor is good (1 Star) but cannot get replacement plastic jar, which cracked and the plastic locking tabs broke off which will not allow it to lock in place to activate the motor. No replacement jar or container found for it even though motor and blades are still good. You say, its cheap, why not buy another? Well, if you don't have the money to replace it, you just don't have it. This unit was used less than 12-15 times before it began to crack apart."
1,pure junk don't waste your money,Black & Decker 10-Cup Power Pro Wide-Mouth Food Processor - FP1510this product is junk- I used it twice and now the lid wont close and so it wont work at all. I'm trying to return it but target.com says that I never ordered it and cant find the purchase. the packing slip says I cant use the packing slip to return it to a store now I dont know what to do.
3,Deceptive Box Advertisement!,"This product seems okay for the general slicing and shredding you'd expect. However, the box is pictured as having a dough blade (red circle #6)--well, this model DOES NOT include it, it's AN OPTION! We needed a larger food processor so I purchased this at a local Target store. Nowhere on the box does it state the dough blade not included, only when you're looking for it and can't find it, then reading the manual again closely to compare the different models listed vs. what's on the box. I should've bought an Oster with the dough blade. Shame on Black & Decker, again!!"
2,Mine broke right away,"I am going to start by admitting that I am pretty hard on kitchen appliances. But that's part of the reason I bought this slightly upscale model for myself, having killed off the motors on several cheap processors in recent years.And the motor on this one, after around 6 or 9 months of intense use is just fine. Until recently, it sliced, grated and ground food very nicely.And then...after merely dropping the lid on the floor (granted, a tile floor) the food processor became unusable. It's hard to describe, but a bit of plastic broke off that prevents the lid from locking properly. And, as a safety feature, the processor won't go without the lid locking on. Yeah, I dropped it, but I would have expected a sturdier product for my money."
3,question,I bought this at a thrift store and it didn't come with the reversible shredding/slicing blade. Does anyone have any advice on where I could get one or if those of you who hate yours might want to sell me your shredding disk??
5,Fantastic Christmas Music!!,"Wow, what a great treat! Ella Fitzgerald AND Christmas music! Looking forward to many years of entertainment listening to the amazing Ella Fitzgerald singing some of my all-time favorite Christmas carols."
4,runs loud,"I bought one refurbished and thought something was wrong with it when I started it up. I called Kitchenaid and they said that it will run louder then the Artisian model because it has all medal gears. Other then that, all is well :)"
2,Bad packaging,"This is the second time I have ordered this product. The product is great, however they have changed the packaging. It is not a plastic bottle as pictured, it is a tube. I do not like the packaging it wastes product and is very inconvenient to use in the shower."
5,Amazing product.,"All I will use for face/body wash. Took about a week to clear skin up, but incredible results for months on end"
1,"I wouldn't take this back, if someone offered it to me for FREE","I should've known what I was getting into when I saw the Igea name on this...This product didn't remove a single hair. But, it did a wonderful job of wasting both time and money. So, if you like wasting time and money, buy all means, purchase it!"
2,looks cheap,It gets scratched really easy and it collects debris in the cut out. It is not as nice as it looks in the picture. I expected it to be a little nicer than it was.
2,buy it for the pictures only...,"When I was looking into getting a chinese crested dog, I bought this book to get a basic idea as to what I would need to know when I owned one. That sort of information was not in abundance. If you're wanting to know more basic type info about the breed, know that pretty much everything I learned regarding that sort of basic info, I learned by surfing through various websites. I found that to be much more beneficial then reading this book. What the book IS good for is the pictures. It does give many of the different looks a chinese crested can have. And it doesn't just show the show dogs. It shows pretty ones, and ugly ones, old ones, and young ones--all with every level of hairyness, and color. I would encourage anyone who'd buying it not to spend more than $... bucks on it."
2,More of a primer...,"I am a new Crested owner and was looking to learn more about the breed. This book really fell short. Although there were plentiful pictures of Cresteds, the book is more of a primer on dog ownership and the show ring than information specific to the Chinese Crested. Further, it's patently obvious that Nylabone is supporting the author...the multiple references to Nylabone were tiresome, particularly in the absence of references to any other product."
4,Chinese Cresteds,"I am very happy with this book. I am new to the CC's and it was very informative with lots of nice pictures.. The book arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. Thank you, L.Jeffries"
5,Great Great Read!!!!,"This book was excellent. The love scenes were so real that i got goose bumps...It was like i was there watching everything unfold. I was so caught up with this author i took it for granted that all her books would be the same soooo Unfortunatly i bought ""Fallen"". It was like a totally different author i was so turned off. I felt like the first book got me hot and bothered to a point where i was going to claim her my favorite author and then... The bomb fell and it was like being thrown in a cold shower...What happened Debra... Where was the magic the flame!!! I don't know but i will wait for the reviews of your next book so that my sistas out there can fore warn me Sorry!!!"
4,"""LUCKY RANDI""","THIS BOOK HAD MY ATTENTION.I LOVED IT,THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GIRL NAMED RANDI,RANDI STARTS OUT WORKING IN A DINER.ONE DAY HER FAVORITE STAR HAPPENS TO COME INTO THE DINER SHE WORKS IN.WHEN ANTHONY(ANIMALISTIC)INVITES HER TO A HOTEL PARTY HE THROWS SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.BUT WHEN SHE GETS THERE SHE IS TOTALLY TURNED OFF BY THE WAY HE TREATS WOMEN.THEN ANTHONY STARTS FALLING FOR RANDI AFTER SHE BLOWS HIM OFF...THEN HE STARTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.RANDI IS CAUGHT UP IN BAD SITUATION BECAUSE SHE ALSO LOVES THIS RAP SUPERSTAR,BUT IS AFRAID HE WILL HURT HER JUST LIKE A PREVIOUS BOYFRIEND HAD DONE HER.BUT WILL HE? ANDI SHOULD BE LUCKY THAT A RAP SUPERSTAR IS IN LOVE WITH HER AND MARRIES HER.THIS BOOK I CAN SAY IS GOOD AND NOT STREET AT ALL."
4,hip hop in love....,"This is definitely a hip hop love story. Well constructed. Debra Clayton has gone behind the scenes to show that supestar Animalistic wants to give up his playa status. Randi Jacobs lets Animalistic know that she is not a groupie and even though she is a fan. Animalistic almost has it all and just when he is accomplishing the inevitable and he has it all, he allows the ""lady"" to blow it for him. Randi cannot believe that he has done this to her, no matter how much money you have, how fine you may be, mansions, ice dripping on your wrist, love will bring you to your knees. This story is a turbulant ride, but that is how love goes. You are up and flying high one day and then the next you are low and scraping the ground, when you start to get back up, you do have some scars and bandaids. Some cuts and breaks take years to mend. This is a easy read."
3,good read..,"RAP SUPERSTAR WAS A OKAY BOOK! RANDI TOOK SOME TIME BUT SHE DID FALL IN LOVE AGAIN!. AND ANTHONY TRIED HIS BEST TO BE A GOOD GUY BUT ITS HARD WHEN YOU HAVE GROUPIES,AM GLAD MRS CLAYTON LET ME GET A CHANCE TO READ THIS NOVEL I LOVED THE ENDING."
1,Not that great,"I'm not sure about the other's who wrote reviews, but maybe they are just friends of the author, or something. But, this book was not that great. It has a catchy title and subject but the author should have put in more details. There was no climax at all. It was just blah!"
5,Great Read,This book is WOW!!!! I recommend this book to everyone. Debra did her thang on this book!!!
3,"I wouldn't say it wasn't great, but...","It was very predictable. Animalistic is our Rap Superstar in this novel. He has everything from money to any woman he wants. Sex is thrown at him so frequently that it becomes expected by EVERY woman! That is until Randi steps on the scene. She's an aspiring writer and film maker - a good girl. Anthony ""Animalistic"" lives up to his name when he expects sex from Randi like he does with everyone else. When she makes it known that she's more than just a hoochie and his groupie, he falls in love with her to say the least. This story was cute, but I already knew the ending when I reached the middle of the book. All in all, it was a good read, and I would still recommend it if you want to be entertained."
3,Not from Ocean's Twelve,"The version of L'Appuntamento that is contained on the album referenced in the other review (Le Piu Belle Canzione) is NOT the same version that is on the Ocean's Twelve soundtrack. The Le Piu version has a corny groovy sixties keyboard and orchestration. I don't know about the version on Appuntamento Con O Vanoni, but if what you are looking for is more of what you heard in Ocean's Twelve, Le Piu is not going to do it for you."
2,"Right Singer, Wrong Album","If you are interested in this album because you heard the title song on the soundtrack of ""Oceans 12"" you have discovered one of Italy's most loved divas with a career that spans decades and wealth of albums to explore. Unfortunately this album is one that has not aged well. In order to get this song along with more of her great ones, I reccomend ""Le Piu Belle Canzoni Di Ornella Vanoni"" which is a double album and well worth the extra bucks. Ornella is incredible and you've only just begun. Enjoy."
3,hmmm,"Bought it for the song from the Ocean's...whatever movie. It's not the same. It's OK, but not the same. Rest of the CD is an aquried taste."
4,Good teaching tool,We got this book to use for our Senior high youth goup. Four weeks into it and it seems to be a good tool. Getting the kids to read the chapter the week ahead is challening but the program is working.
3,poor man's PoP Chips,"While not at all bad, I find pop chips to taste much better. The Booty chips are more dense, also the flavored versions are awful compared to the pop chips."
1,Same problem here - doesn't hold a charge,"I experienced the same problem as the other reviewer - the unit didn't hold a charge even after 72+ hours of charging. Ordered a replacement unit within a week and couldn't believe it, but also this one had the problem and I needed to return again !"
2,not what i expected,Purchase with expectations that was to high. I thought the outlet for power was like other things with outlet. Worked great until my son plugged in a saw into power outlet . That was the end of power the other things went out shortly after.
4,Neat gadget,"On a single charge I used the compressor to top off two tires and fill two more that were almost flat. The device reports that it has some power left even after that. The compressor is not speedy, but I wouldn't expect it to be. After all the compressor use I did notice that the rubber hose got pretty darned hot. It does not seem to have affected anything though and I doubt the compressor was meant to fill up four tires in a row like that. I don't have any complaints so far given the price and what I think it was designed for. I think I got a decent value for what I paid.UPDATE: It is 2013 and this unit is still working for me. I have used it to fill up multiple tires and jump a few batteries. It has survived cold weather conditions that are probably well out of operating specification (note this isn't an all-weather piece of equipment - I'm just saying that I've not been ""nice"" to it). I think at this point I got my money out of it, and it's still going."
3,Falls short,"I've had the Powerpack 200 for six months. I use it for powering up my computer if I can't find an outlet, pumping up bike tires, and for an emergency back-up if the power goes out in the house. The powerpack is a little too big and bulky as a portable. I leave it in the trunk of my car. It also needs to be recharged often (once a week) and takes a whole day to recharge. I doubt it could jump start a car (it has cables) or do big electrical back-ups. Although it performs small tasks for me it falls short of my expectations."
5,THE POETESS,"As a fellow poet, I can definitely tell you that Mr. Ivory composes his work not just from his heart, but from way down deep in his soul. This is a brilliant work of art from a truly gifted spirit. I look forward to his next piece with great anticipation."
4,I keep coming back to it,"I teach middle school Sunday school and keep trying different books, but somehow end up each year using this one instead. It's got topics that get the kids talking and activities they aren't embarassed to do."
5,could not put it down,I have read all four Jack Prester mystery books You feel like you are right in the park with him.
4,I wish they still made Weebles!!,"My sons LOVE Weeble toys, I was very sad to find out that they are no longer made. I was lucky to find this one--it comes with a nice (a bit long) storybook and my sons (6 and 2) love to act out the story."
2,"Sufficient, but not great","The guide is small and conveniently sized, but the information is sparse and not entirely accurate. 5* for size, 2* for content."
1,Diamond Pool Cue,I would not recommend the purchase of this item to anyone. It is a very inferior item about the same quality as a house stick.
3,"Look after ""At Their Best""","This CD is exactly as the ""At Their Best Selection"", I wonder if the booklet is also the same. Please check my review in that CD:"
3,Razor phone cover,I order this product for my mom and she loved them. They are made of a thin material and she did not have any issues with the cases.
2,Beware: 2-track promo EP rather than a CD,"I had earlier bought Bebe's ""Pafuera Telarañas"" and so was disappointed when I bought this, thinking it was a wholly separate album. It's not; the tracks on it - both of them (Malo and Siempre me Quedará) - are great, but are taken as samples from Pafuera Telarañas. I've given it 2 stars simply on a value for money basis. I notice Amazon suggests buying both this EP together with Pafuera Telarañas, reinforcing the idea that it's a different album......"
2,not at all what i expected,This is not what I was expectng when I recieved this book and I mean that in a bad way. The only thig I noticed this book has done for me is help me build my wardrobe from scratch. Meaning putting a whole in my wallet. It gives me ideas on what to wear with certain items I have in my closet and what kind of things I need in my closet... So far I got all the tops types listed in this book... next pants and jeans... hehe... but overall I dont really recommend this book... Ive just been trying to use this book the best way I can since I dont want to spend $ on the return for shipping and handling...
4,Good buy,"I read this book at the library and bought a copy for my sister. We both enjoy Lucky magazine and this book as well. It is a great overview on a woman's closet from fashion sense, essentials, and organization. The only downside I can think of is the random 2-page blurbs featuring a ""style-expert"" of some kind. They do not add to the book in any way and just distract from the goal of appealing to the majority of women. Overall, it is a great gift for friends and family."
3,Not what I thought...,"This won't tell you if you can wear white socks with tan pants or what color belt to wear with blue jeans and black shoes. This book will tell you what staple items to have in your closet and will sometimes tell you what pieces of clothing look better on which bodies, but not always. I liked the section that had recommendations on what to pack if you're traveling. That helped me reduce the items in my suitcase without reducing the number of outfits. I've been a little disappointed that it doesn't offer more advice though."
4,Excelente!!,"En general me pareció bueno el libro, pienso que es un básico que cualquier mujer debe tener, te ayuda a definir cuantas prendas y cuales son las necesarias para poder tener un guardarropa completo, además dan bastantes ideas acerca de como combinar una misma prenda para cada ocasión, tiene buenas imagenes y es muy colorido, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
3,Somewhat disappointing,I bought a used copy so price was not bad. Seemed a bit dated. Useful but I was not too excited about it either.
3,oldddddd,"a lot of the clothing mentioned in this book looked like late 90s or early 2000s as far as fashion is concerned. i wasn't too impressed with a good deal of it, but there were a handful of things i liked in it."
4,Great Gift for the Fashionista,I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it. She works as a manager for a high end clothing company so she loves fashion.
1,"Save Your Money, Unless Money is No Object","This book is the biggest waste of $[...]. First of all, it's too big and bulky to take shopping with you. Secondly, it expects you to wear a million clothes, I'm sorry but I don't have that kind of money. Finally, some of the stuff they want you to wear may look like [...] on you. If you have a couple of thousands to spend on a new wardrobe, then buy the book and have a ball. If the only shopping spree you know of is at the local Goodwill (like me:) then spend that money on 4 pairs of jeans and 5 tops, trust me, you will be a lot better off."
3,Not the Best Out There,"This book is OK, but it lacks usable content, and some of the sample looks are just not wearable for most women. Also, some of the advice is questionable. This might appeal to a hip teenager or someone looking to put a little inspiration into their already-great style, but if you want a good manual on how to dress, buy The Pocket Stylist instead."
5,A must-have for young career women,"I am in early 30s, and one of my big concerns is that I'd like to dress up a bit more in daily work life but don't know how to do so. I am in a consulting business. I know how to dress up in a full suit when I have to, but it was difficult for me to look comfortably dressed up without looking too casual.What I like about this book is that it has practical tips I can use in the moment. I keep it on top of my desk and look at it whenever I need it- like what shoes to match with my pencil skirt (or which one to avoid)However, I agree with other reviews that this book is more appropriate for young/middle aged career women. I think this book will be a fabulous graduation gift for young women who's about to enter work life."
4,loved it,This book was fabulous! It was exactly what I was looking for. It gives the blue print to fashion while encouraging you to express your own personality. It highlights certain body types (of corse not every body type can be listed or this book would be huge and hard to shop with) and the pros and cons to wearing that certain pieces of clothing. It even gives tips on what to do in the dressing room to ensure you go home with a piece that is perfect. I cant think of any cons!
3,Helpful for outfit ideas,"Pictures of outfits were very helpful for ideas about putting new outfits together. Except on page 174 it looks as though they are suggesting to wear a denim 'suit' i.e. head to toe denim. Which we all know is a fashion no-no. All in all a good idea book to get you thinking about different options and combinations of cloths and shoes. I get most of my fashion advice from the show 'What Not To Wear' on TLC. Hosts Clinton Kelly and Stacy London have great advice and they have a book, here's the link:Dress Your Best: The Complete Guide to Finding the Style That's Right for Your Body"
3,It was OK,"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. I really had fun reading the second book ""The Lucky Guide to Mastering Any Style"", which I read first, and I had higher expectations of the first book. I believe it can be useful, but only to someone who really has no idea what to buy for work wear or for the leasure activities. Someone who'd have trouble picking out an appropriate dress for the party.I did found some interesting tips in the book, but nothing extraudinary. Also some of the outfits demonstrated really disappointed me. For example combining casual cotton stripped t-shirt with lacey assymetrical dressy skirt looked totally out of place.Another thing that was not to my liking was combining black and brown in the same outfit. I remember more than one photo where black outfit worn with brown shoes or vice versa."
4,This book ROCKS!!,I am so lucky to have found this book! It rocks! It is really helpful in helping me build my closet. I am going to have to buy it so I can mark it up and things.
5,Get it at the libary.,"I love the book it breaks down how many different items you need to make a full wardrobe and not have to worry about running out of clothes for a while.-Blouses-T-shirts-Pants Skirts-Dress-Handbags-Shoes-stockingsand more.They also break down what you need by season. Like a a Good wool winter coat, white summer pants, and spring/fall jackets. If you live in a place where winter or summer never comes then you can choose what to buy and what not to buy.You only need this book to make a complete list of what you need and don't need. That's why I wouldn't purchase it. The book has been out for about 6 years. Most of the fashion in the book is still current-ish. But I hope in a Year or two Lucky will come out with a revision."
3,If You Need a Starter Guide to Fashion,"This book is for you only if you have no idea how to put together a basic wardrobe. I would have liked this book better had there been people in the clothes. Just a picture of the clothes themselves really doesn't illustrate most fashion for me, since things often look vastly different on the hanger than on a real person. In fact, I think the main point is how something fits you and makes you shine as a person. I also found a lot of the advice so tired that anybody could have told you what to do."
5,"Awesome book, simple guide","I got this book for Christmas, and I think it's excellent. It goes over nearly every part of your wardrobe (I don't recall seeing a section on shorts, personally ... and why do they NEVER mention sneakers? People wear them!) and, unlike some of the high fashion standards set forth on shows like What Not To Wear (as much as I love it), it's a guide for everyone and suggestions on how to stock your closet like a good pantry and look great every day. I'm learning what pieces are missing from my wardrobe AND how to better put together pieces I already own. They make suggestions for every body type and include suggestions for accessories. I haven't tested out the fitting room tips yet, but I will probably take the book along the next time I shop! I think the only thing missing is a summary of what your completed wardrobe should contain."
5,Best Woman's Wardrobe Book of Late,"Lucky magazine?s excellent book, the Lucky Shopping Manual, is a great splurge for any woman who is looking to build her wardrobe, rebuild it, or revamp it. I?ve only gotten through half of the book, but I can honestly say it is worth every cent. It instructs how to determine the proper fit of every bit of clothing from jeans & tee-shirts to dresses & suits. It also gives tailoring, and accessory suggestions with witty aplomb. It?s the best book of its ilk that I've purchased over the past six months. In Style's book of style is good, but could have been organized a little better. The ""What Not to Wear"" book was more straightforward and slim lined, but made me feel, surprisingly, slovenly. Lucky?s book makes me feel like I've gotten it right at least half-way right."
3,The Lucky Shopping Manual,"This book is really written for the under 30 year old woman. It is very detailed and thoughtful but I really couldn't say that I picked up any good fashion ideas for my age group (50+ years). I have bought The Pocket Stylist by Kendall Farr and some of the ""What not to wear"" series and have found them fantastic and appropriate.I think I will give The Lucky Shopping Manual to my daughter who is 25 years and she will love it."
5,The best style book out there,"I absolutely loved this book and have read it cover to cover several times. The ""In the Fitting Room"" pages have saved me so much money and I now know why I've never work some of my mistake purchases. Even though the book is a few years old it doesn't look dated, it's more about right fit and styling than a list of outfits to copy."
2,Becoming out of date,"This book is now becoming out of date. The fashion rules are still worthwhile, but the example outfits look dated. The shoes, skirts, etc. seem like they're from a time past (which they are). I don't recommend you buy this book, find something more current."
4,"Visually pleasing, but less substance on dressing for your body type","This manual is really helpful in that it lays out a variety of ways to wear a lot of different outfits. It gives you lots of options and lots of combinations, which is nice, but I really wish the editors of this book had taken some time to give some solid advice on how to dress for your specific body type (i.e. petite, pear-shaped, etc). I loved flipping through and seeing the different types and styles of the tops, bottoms, jackets, etc, but still wanted to know more about what looks good on someone who is petite. I bought the Pocket Sylist by Kendall Farr and found that her book provided a lot of the information I was looking for which was specific to my body type. Use the Lucky mag as a way to stimulate your imagination and the Pocket Stylist for the ABCs of what's flattering for your specific body type."
3,stiff .... and I'm not talking about the bodies,"Briliant, dedicated and driving me away from this author. This book was boring and was written in such a stiff manner that I nearly cried. The reviews led me to believe that this book was entertaining and wonderfully written. I have never read a fictional book about archeologist/detectives that was this humorless and this dull.Ms. Cameron ... I suggest that you read Elizabeth Peters (her earlier ones) or Beverly Connor (who has an anthropology/archeology twist) to see how to combine archeology and murder into an enjoyable read. It did not have to be funny but at least it should have been interesting."
5,First book in a series,"I bought books 2,3, and 4 used at a booksale and read them before I got this book that is the first one in the series. I really enjoyed all the books, but reading book one explained a lot. In the whole series I enjoyed the references to the methods archeologists use to get meaning from the tiny bits and pieces that are often all they find. The characters were real to me. Emma & her husband were living with the kinds of worries that most of us deal with these days, about their marriage, money, jobs, coworkers, family, and friends. I also liked that I can safely reccomend this book series to anybody, including my mother and coworkers of both genders."
3,nice tiny book,be advised this is a very tiny book but it is nice. This was a nice easy book for preschool homeschoolers. I am using it to give my 2 almost 3 year old a head start and she is really enjoying learning in a fun way. I would definitely buy again!
3,Much smaller than I was expecting.,"This book is so very tiny. I had no idea that it was going to be this small. It is only about three inches by four inches and has very few pages. Granted, it was not very expensive, and will work as something to tuck into my purse for when my son needs something to do on the go, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. It does have some fun activities, which is why I gave it three stars, but the size was a big drawback."
2,Itsy bitsy little book....,"Very small activity book, not exactly as I expected. Guess it might have been in the description but I didn't catch that. This book is about 4x3 in size and difficult for my kids to handle. Definitely have other, better books out there that can teach this skill, but could be nice as stocking stuffer or for travel with kids in car."
5,A very factual and realistic story about overcoming adversit,"A wonderful history lesson for young adults. This factual chronicle of the life of Sacajawea's son, Charbonneau, will dispel the myth that Clark (of Lewis & Clark) made good on his promise to his Indian guide, Sacajawea. He did provide an education and board and room, but little else. In spite of the prejudice this boy faced, he was able to succeed in life. The book is well-written, factual, and written without predjudice. I would recommend this for required reading in junior high school."
3,Informative story that changed my views,"Having only legend and folklore to base my opinion on, I have always had one thought concerning Wild Bill. After reading this book I have opened my mind to new ideas with regards to him. The author's use of eyewitness accounts of what his life and times really were like, I found to be credible. After finishing this book I now have a new respect for Mr. Hickok and what he stood for."
5,smooth and worth it.,I put these on a F350 and it rides like factory new. The old motorcraft shocks had holes rusted in the sides and were basicly seized. when i installed these i thought they were to soft but they seem great now. they arrived early and went on smooth.
4,Monroe Relfex Shock,These shocks are just what my truck needed. They are slightly larger in diameter than the stock Ford shocks. They work well on my truck.
5,Good Buy,This is what I like about the Angie Taylor book:1. It is in color - Rating 1 out of 1. Publishers take note: I just won't buy a book that is b&w with the color pics on the CD.2. It has a CD (but could look to a DVD with update and more samples etc. See the DVD that ships with the book Studio Secrets - Premiere and After Effects) - Rating 1 of possible 3. Publishers take note - I won't buy a book without a CD and soon without a DVD.3. Content covers the basics and some of the new features - Rating 2.5 of 5 if you are an experienced user; 4.5 out of 5 if you are a new user4. She has a great website where she have put out new tutorials to keep up with new features like integrating Cinema4d with AE and lip sync - This saves you money - you don't have to buy a whole new book to take advange of each new AE realease. Rating 3 out of possible 3
2,Limited,This book doesn't cover very much.. The majority of this book - cover's material that anyone who has toyed around with the program knows..get after effects bible
5,Excellent,"Angies book is absolutely fantastic. Her methods are extremely creative and versatile. The book reads like a huge tutorial although you can easily dip into any section at any time. It covers all the new features of AE5 including parenting, expressions and 3d. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a leading edge in their after effects work. Well done Angie!"
2,More about bragging then about the application,"I have read many books on after effects (well just about all that are out on after effects) and this one leaves little to desire. It lacks any real direction and seems to be used more to ""brag"" about what projects people have worked on in there portfolio. I found very little useful information in the book. The examples were poorly written and illustrated and most of them were very simple to begin with. I would not recommend this book unless you are just interested in what people have done with after effects"
4,"Nice book but not really ""creative""",Perfect technical and detailed informations about After Effects as an animation tool. Angie is a really good teacher and must be creative. But unfortunately the tutorial samples in the book arent so professional or creative. Well the book is still a great course for AE rookies although based on version 5.0
5,2 Great Pieces and a Few Good Ones,"Nielsen's Helios Overture is one the greatest tone poems ever written. Even people who hate Nielsen love it. It really leaves you feeling that you have just witnessed a sunrise from the Acropolis. This piece alone is worth the price of the CD.""Fantasy Voyage to the Faroes"" is a beautiful seascape piece that you will want to play again and again. Both of these great tone poems are well preformed.The other pieces on this CD are good, but they are mostly for lovers of Nielsen's music."
5,A total page turner!!From begining to end ..,All of the Mongo books are just spine tingling from beginning to end ....I really wish he'd write more!!This was my favorite Mongo mystery but the Veil books are even better !!!!!!!!!!Buy it!! read it11 now!!!You wouldn't regret it .......but be prepared to read it from statr to finish in one sitting!
3,Comparable to John Makujina's Measuring the Music,"Dr. Garlock does a fair job with the issue at hand. However, he does at times make unguarded statements that reveal his undaunting presuppositions. It is hard to tell from the book exactly what kind of music he would draw the line at as acceptable, although he obviously thinks anything classed as ""Rock"" is detrimental. John Makujina's book ""Measuring the Music"" is a much more masterful and better documented source for each of the arguments."
5,Best scraper I've ever used,"This thing is great, can scrap a fine layer or heavily painted or crusted surface. Not gonna make the job easy, but certainly easier."
1,Precise? Not Even Close!,"I purchased a similar model by Taylor about 15 years ago. I moved it from old house to new and it is still going strong. I recently bought this new model for another window in my house. Today's version of this product should no longer be marketed as a thermometer. It holds no relationship to reality. 32 degrees reads as 15 degrees. Most wintry mornings, it reads below zero when it's actually in the 20s. I noticed this unit uses a much smaller spring-steel coil than the old original. It's a shame. The old one is still very, very close in temperature reading many, many years after purchase. The new one simply doesn't qualify. Please avoid this product. They should not be selling these with good conscience."
1,Star Trek hackwork,"Here's a question: Why, unlike the first book in the New Earth series, is BELLE TERRE written as if the target reader is a 9-year-old? The vocabulary and sentence structure are barely up to the standards of a YA (young adult) novel, and the story itself is a simple-minded meet-the-deadline crisis that ends exactly the way one thinks it will.The book is needlessly divided into four arbitrary ""parts""; the natural assumption here is that it was done for padding, a fair conclusion when one sees a countdown (""Four. Three. Two...."") divided into separate paragraphs. The dialogue is straight from the cliche encyclopedia, with enough ""one-quarter impulse, Mr. Sulu""s and ""course plotted and laid in sir""s to fill three or four bad novels. And the author's idea of a scare? ""Skeletons."" That's right: skeletons.My advice: skip directly to Part Three and a different author, where there should be enough background to discern the essentials of this piece of hackwork."
3,Why sequel writers should read the series,"I'm only part way through the book but had to stop and share my frustration. In ""Belle Terre"", Kirk orders the Starfleet cutter Impeller of Captain Merkling to aid in the search for some lost children. Apparently, Kirk is senile because in ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" the Impeller, severly damaged by the Orions, was sent limping back to Federation space with a blinded Captain Merkling on board. The only possible explanations are that 1) Q made an early appearance and helped out, 2) transwarp was developed, used ot get the Impeller back to Belle Terre quickly, or 3) the author and the editor screwed up royally. Sorry, but I have to go with option 3 as my final answer. This bodes ill for the rest of the book."
2,A Miserable Start,"I was afraid the push would be toward these multi-book stories. The last time I saw this I bought the entire VECTORS series of Star Trek books all at once -- a decision I regret to this day. At least this time all I am out is the price of one new book (selling cheap). This book just drags. Too much detail, too many characters. I am a stalwart fan of the series and I was just bored to tears with this one."
2,It got bogged down,"Normally I really like series'. For instance, I thought Millenium, the Badlands, Day of Honor, Captain's Table, and the New Frontier series were all great. But I have to admit, this one got boring, confusing, and had a strange ending. Too much technobabble made it get bogged down as they try to move the moon. It wasn't very original, either. The character developement needed some help. I normally like Diane Carey, but wow, this one I could have done without."
2,A major falloff from the series start,"After a rollicking start to the New Earth series, this latest entry is a major disappointment, taking a deep dive from the story and plot quality of the first version. In this novel, the aliens that caused so much of the havoc and intrique in the first novel have essentially disappeared. meanwhile, we get lots of colonial sniping. Spock's role is to call out probabilities to the umpteeth decimal point, a hackneyed cliche that is used over and over here. In every chapter, it seems, there is a new doomsday scenario, with Spock calculating the odds of success in the single-digits percent, yet Kirk & Co. pull off one predictable miracle after another. There is one poignant moment when the small crew of one ship, send out on a scouting mission, dies in the dark, powerless vacuum of space, their ship made black by a mysterious phenomenon that is neither explained nor used again. Coming on the eels of the gripping first novel, this one turns out to be a dud."
4,Excellent story.,"Much better than the first in the series, thanks to the fact that Dean Wesley Smith doesn't torture the language the way Diane Carey does. Just as in the first installment, the plot and characterization, the pacing and the general idea are all very good to excellent. Unlike the first installment, this author understands how to use the language to best effect. Highly recommended; it doesn't even seem to me that it would be hard to follow this book without having read the previous episode, the backstory is filled in unobtrusively and as thoroughly as needed, but no more than that."
4,"all that it says it is, but cheaper to buy local","These paper sleeves have a plastic window for displaying their contents, and a tab on the back to hold the top flap shut. I can't think of anything else I could ask from disk sleeves.Tip: either buy these as part of a Free Super Saver Shipping order, or buy them locally. After shipping, it's far cheaper to buy them at your local Staples, CompUSA, or something like that."
2,Not What They Used To Be,"I am replenishing a bundle of Memorex CD & DVD Sleeves that I bought a few years back. The sku is the same...0 34707 01961 4 but the Country of origin has changed as well as the quality. The original box of ""Memorex CD & DVD Sleeves"" was manufactured in Taiwan. The original Memorex sleeves are slightly larger as another reviewer has noted, but more importantly, in my opinion, they are a heavier duty stock as well as a ""bright white"" in color vs. a grey/white in color and flimsy sleeve on the current product that is manufactured in China. I am very disappointed in the current product and will be looking for a new manufacture."
5,CD sleeves,"arrived before I expected them to, pleasant surprise. I find these to be my choice for protecting CDs and such that I mail to my friends. More of them can fit into a mailer, and I pay less in postage due to their light weight."
3,Valtz 4 drawer CD/DVD storage cabinet,"I had previously purchased this same model unit and when it became full was glad to find I could order an identical unit to store the accumulating discs. The first unit was excellent quality, but the drawers stuck in the second unit, requiring slaming of drawers shut while holding cabinet to get them fully closed. I tried the drawers from the original cabinet in new case and had same problem; new drawers worked fine in old cabinet. All 4 drawers bound on the upper right corner, so I suspect cabinet is slightly twisted, but there was no sign of damage to the shipping boxes - two boxes over unit. I decided to just live with the problem rather than attemmpt an exchange.The unit iis well made, attractive, and each drawer has a key lock. It would have been nicer if the units were configured for stacking as the top unit will slide on bottom."
3,Memorex cd sleeves need improvement,"This product would be fine if the manufacturer did not use low quality material for the see-through window on this product. It doesn't take very long till the see-through plastic gets so wrinkled that it looks and feels awful! Please, people, you who make this product, have a heart! Put some quality material into this product, else you won't be trusted with other things you make! Surely, it won't cost you that much, and you won't get a tumb down review!"
1,Beware the shipping costs,"I thought this would be a great buy, but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy. Screw that."
4,Not too bad...,"I previously purchased Memorex brand sleeves nearly a year ago, and was very satisfied, but there is this recent stock is definitely a bit more narrow than the previous (as others have noted). I often store two disc per envelope, and it's a bit more of a squeeze. They are also a tad more flimsy, but that's okay-- it's just discs, not heirloom china, right? :) Overall, they serve the purpose."
3,Dry Read,"Hard to review what is basically a text book, however this is good preparation material for Project Management."
4,Could Be a Little Clearer,"Like most other reviewers, I found the book well organized. Occasionally, however, in an effort to move through the material quickly, he omits a definition for the topic he is introducing.For example: Project Objectives (p.57) is introduced as follows: ""A project might include a variety of obectives, such as...The objectives might also include..."" That's great. But what is an objective?"
3,Good but not enough,PMP In Depth: Project Management Professional Study Guide for PMP and CAPM Exams (In Depth)I read through this book three times before my first PMP exam. But I failed the exam. It is a good reference book but not good enough to let me pass the exam. I'm reading Rita's PMP EXAM PREP which should prepare me to pass the PMP exam.
1,Suspect,"I have been in the project management field for a couple years, completed a couple non-PMI courses, and interested in studding for the PMP. I have been reading the reviews of this book with the hope of getting unbiased advisement. I am willing to bet that a good percentage of these reviews are completely bogus. Not sure if the goal is to sell more books or what? If you notice most every review seems to be a carbon copy of a previous, to the extent that verbiage is cut-n-paste, not much original thought here. I am sure that there are a couple decent reviews here, but a lot of them seem suspect."
4,"Pretty good, except for the practice questions.","Pros: Good book with a nice layout and summary sections at the end of every chapter. Good glossary.Cons: Practice questions sometimes misleading in how many answers the question is looking for. I believe that the actual computer-based testing tells you how many answers it requires, where this book inconsistently tells you this. Basically, it makes you sometimes doubt your learning because you aren't sure if there is more than one answer which may lead you to choose another answer that you feel may or may not be correct. I think this can be confusing and counterproductive to learning the material."
4,Effective.,"I was able to pass the CAPM exam using this book. However, the book doesn't focus specifically on that test. All the information is geared towards studying for the PMP. There are no dedicated lessons or tips for how to apply the information learned to the CAPM. I found myself going into the test with a broader understanding of the project management body of knowledge than I probably needed."
5,Simply the Best,"I used this study guide to pass the PMP exam and now I use it to teach a project management course. Simply put: it's the best PMP study guide and an excellent project management book. Dr. Sanghera explains all the concepts from scratch and treats each topic to depth appropriate for the exam and for a first course in project management. The material is self contained and is organized according to the official exam specifications, which is also more or less the order in which we run projects in real life. I love the presentation style. As another reviewer said: all concepts are woven together into a big picture. You prepare for the exam while learning project management concepts.Highly recommended."
4,"A good, practical resource","I bought this book when it first came out because after spending nearly a decade in project management I finally decided it was time to get my PMP. I also bought books by several other well known PMP-prep authors who shall remain nameless and I found this one to be the most useful. I read it before really studying the PMBOK in depth and I'm glad that I did as it gave me some background that made the PMBOK a bit easier to digest.My only critique, really, is that I thought the book ""talked down"" to me a bit. That may just be me. Well done overall and, for me, worth the investment."
2,super support pantyhose,"I have been buying these stockings for years. Now they have suddenly changed the actually length and size of the pantie on the sizes, and they do not fit right. I buy size tall, which used to fit perfectly. Size tall is now too short in the length of the stocking and way too big in the pantie section. I have to pull them up to my chest in order to get the leg part anywhere near where it should be. Who's bright idea was it to decide to revise a good thing!!!! STUPID!!!!!! If I wanted queen size, I would have ordered Queen size!"
3,OK Fun,"I loved and still love most of these shows, so to get their themes on CD for under $10.00 seemed like a no-brainer. I must say though that are not by the original artists and listening to them gives me the feeling I'm listining to one of those K-Tel records from the 70's where they advertised all the latest pop hits on a record and when you got it, it was done by some lame band, not the original. While the bands here are pretty close to the original it just doesn't quite sound the same. Still it's a small investment so take a chance."
1,Disappointment,"The name Zilouris is connected with cretan music, which is very very different from greek music. Especially the lyra is an outstanding feature in cretan music. This record is nothing of the kind, just ordinary boring greek music.I'm very disappointed and will never again buy a cd, when there is no possibility to listen to samples."
1,DISLIKE!!!,The book is not the same as what they have it as shown!! Lost my money and waste of my time!
2,Targus Digital TGK-NS Digital Camera Neck Strap is better!,"Targus Digital TGK-NS Digital Camera Neck Strap and this strap are--and I own a couple of each--no comparison: the Targus strap is better built, stronger, and really ideal for carrying your USB key drives all around. And it's cheaper. Check it out with an Amazon search. I prefer the Targus strap."
1,Don't Do It!,Why wouldyou spend that kind of money for a cheap lanyard when RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON you can buy one for 99 cents. Don't click the first result you see - look further!!!!!
1,"Neckstrap is VERY weak in material, literally broke the first time I used it.","I would not recommend this neckstrap, VERY cheap plastic that you must deal with care. Not worth my time to send it back to replace, beware buyers!!"
1,Received a wrong lanyard and the quality is very poor!,"Picture showed a black lanyard with a different quality, the one i recieved is black and white lanyard and the quality is not that great.Never expected from amazon!"
3,Not good not bad,If 3$ is not a big deal for you than buy this item but if you are looking something cool this is not for you
5,Black Girl Lost,"Awesome. This book was a easy, well-written and compelling read. Each character blew me away. I could envision each of them and I did not want the story to end. Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this book"
3,Not what I thought....,"101 people before me have already told you ""about"" this novel so I'll keep mine short. This book was just ok for me, but ok enough for me to want to read #2 to find out what happens. Maybe (I hope) it's better than this one."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I started reading this book and after the first couple of chapters had to put it down. I am a very sensitive person and I just couldn't get past the things this young girl was doing with the insurance man, and how her mother was behind it. Yuck!"
5,gotta finish this series!,"I started backwards by reading the the fourth book. A friend of mine let me read it when I rode the bus from Augusta to Detroit, I almost finished it half way back to Augusta, but pack it by accident for Korea! I finished it just to be made at the ending and hooked to know how this who line started and now I'm on book number two as soon as it gets here! Johnnie Wise is making my tour in Korea go by real fast!!!!!"
5,A GOOD READ,"I'VE JUST FINISHED READING BOOKS ONE THRU SEVEN. I ENJOYED READING ABOUT LITTLE JOHNNIE WISE. WHAT A STORY AND A LIFE. IT'S A RIVETING TALE ABOUT NEW ORLEANS AND THE OLD ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF A KEPT WOMEN.ONE EVENT WILL CHANGE THIS YOUNG, BLACK GIRL FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS SERIES."
1,a C- and that's grading on a scale,"Little Black Girl Lost wasn't anything to write home about... This book was boring at best... Maybe this was Mr Johnson's first book , if this is the case then I understand the boredom... A Carl Weber he is not...Do not go out and buy this book, borrow it from the library or from a friend... If you do borrow it from the library and keep it pass its due date, they probrably won't charge you a late fee and if you borrow it from a friend, they probably won't care if you don't return it either... Take a break and and hook up with Mr Weber before you pen another book Mr Johnson... TT4N"
3,Good Read....,This was a great tale of a young woman who truly learned that when life gives you lemons to make lemonade. I read the sequel and it was good as well. Keep up the good work.
5,Always Makes You Think........,"Keith Lee Johnson always makes you go hmmmmmm after reading his novels. This was a treat to see Ms.Wise grow up. I read Fate's Redemption first so the woman I knew was very abrasive with her speech when she spoke with her nephews about their relationships.Now I truly understand what happened to her but I have to say this character was by no means ignorant. Although her mother basically pimped her to a white man. Johnnie uses all of this to her advantage. Buying her own house at the tender age of sixteen.After that the book takes off with murder,mayhem and mafia. I hated to see the end of this novel. I can't wait to get my hands on Little Black Girl Lost 2. I am now a true blue Keith Lee Johnson Fan."
3,Not What I Thought ...,"Little black girl lost taken place in 1950's is a story about a 15 year old southern belle name Johnnie, a avid church goer and has a passion for singing. But her life takes a sudden change when her mother sells her virginity to a rich white man name Earl Shamus. Shamus sleeps with Johnnie every week until she begins to enjoy their sexual incounters. Johnnie school-mates learn that Johnnie sells her body to a white man, they taunt her until she withdraws from school. I felt that reading this book, thet Johnnie was navie BUT she seemed too comfortable in my opinion. She didn't seem like an average black girl lost. She was more of a gold digger. I had the impression that Johnnie's life would have been filled with more drama and heartache but she was so pretty that she got her way most of the time. The book seemed unrealistic."
3,readaholic,I enjoyed this novel. Although Johnny may have had more opportunities I believe that it was hard for her to find them. It feels like you're doomed when the one person in your life whom you believe you can depend on lets you down when you're an adult. I can only imagine what Johnny felt like when it happened to her. This along with what was going on in those times made it hard for many people to see the truth. Johnny is not out of the ordinary. I have to give her props for doing the best she knew how at such a young age.
4,Acadamey Award Winning Book!,"Very good book,but I feel there should have been more action toward the end of the book."
4,Very Good Book,"This book was very good. The author really did a good job. Although it took me loger than most books to read because of other tasks, I must say it was worthwile. I just started part 2 I hope its just as good."
4,Little Black Girl Lost,"I really hate when I do a review on a book and post it, only to find out that my review wasnt posted. Well that's what happened with Little Black girl Lost. So Im going to try again, I really enjoyed this book. Johnnie is a very smart girl from the age of 12 to current she knows how to handle her money, lovers and her boyfriend. She uses what she got to get what she want. This book was a good read."
3,THIS WAS OKAY,"This is the last installment of the Little Black Girl Lost series. I read the first two and to be honest I read the last one just to find out what happens next for Johnnie. I really tried to sympathize with her character, but I couldn't. It seemed like she was gluttoned for purnishment. After all of the heartbreak and misery, you would think she would just leave the town. One positive of this novel is that the author tied up all of the lose ends and did not have you wondering what happened to each of the favorite characters from this series. Its' worth the read if you started reading Little Black Girl Lost from the beginning."
4,Can Hardly Wait,"It took me awhile to get around to reading this book, but once I started I could not put it down. Now I can hardly wait to find out what happens with Johnnie, Lucas and Napolean. Johnnie Wise may have been sixteen but she was ""wise"" beyond her years in some respects."
5,Only Creature Teacher Was Better,"This book had a great plot that was well thought out by R.L. Stine. You would think, after writing almost 70 GB books, and 100's of other books, R.L. Stine would have run out of ideas. But this book, was completely original, and it was great. Everything was in place, and understandable the first time read through, except for the ending, which I had to read through a few times to finally understand. It was suspenseful the whole way through. I never would have possibly guessed the ending. The characters seemed very real. They had real characteristics. They had real feelings. They had real problems. They were so real, you felt like you were Monty. This book had an ending that was inventive, and unthinkable while reading the book. I had several ideas that I thought would be endings, and only one was even remotely close. However, as I mentioned before, I had to read through it a couple of times to figure it out."
3,A Weird Book,"This definetly isn't one of R.L. Stine's best. The book is cool and very realisitic, but near the end the narrator changed from Monty to Nan and I got lost. The ending was predictable, considering that I've read many Goosebumps books. Still, I have to say that it is decent, with many interesting twists. Mediocre, at best."
3,OK,"This book wasn't bad, but it was not as good as I expected and it is not R.L. Stines best work. I like a lot of his other books better."
1,"Crappy product, crappy company.","Battery was DOA. I hadn't used it for the first 30 days (I only used the actual inverter, I had charged the battery and it had appeared to work). Wrote to Xantrex, no response. I'll have to buy another one from some other more reputable company."
1,Deceptive Descriptioon,"The seller has description listed as it is what is pictured but it is NOT it is only the Inverter not battery pack as listed in the description. Emailed them they said I ""should"" have known because of the price."
2,Mediocre,"This is a terribly mediocre piece of fiction. The plot and prose are both quite pedestrian and basic; long sections, or even short chapters of the novel are comprised of dialogue without even any reference to the characters movements; there are no real characters as such, but trite and stock military cliches; petty moralizing; a confusing and out of place attempt at military diction; a total lack of Greek culture and understanding; and transposing modern values and ideas upon ancient times that are poorly documented.That being said, the book is mildly entertaining and somewhat interesting in regards to Afghanistan. Despite disliking the authors attempt to find modern parallels with Alexander's Afghan quest, it was still at least interesting. There are also hints at talent in the authors prose. Sometimes he turns a nice sentence or poetic description. Honestly, I find it amazing such thoroughly mediocre work is so lauded or popular; but I suppose I should expect as much these days."
4,Solid Read,"This book is good, though it does not rise to the level of Gates of Fire. Nonetheless, it was enjoyable and seemed to give a sense of what we face in Afghanistan even today."
4,The Pressfield Histories,"Here's the short of it: For those who have never read a Pressfield 'history,' you need to join the club. I enjoyed the Pressfield historical novels in this order. Also, for you folks new to Pressfield and/or his historical genre, I have likened each to a film that may help put the book into some sense of perspective.1. Gates of Fire akin to Braveheart, Gladiator and Glory2. Last of the Amazons akin to Last of the Mohicans and Troy3. Virtues of War akin to Patton and Spartacus4. Tides of War akin to In Harm's Way5. The Afghan Campaign akin to Kingdom of HeavenI enjoyed each of these books, and I enjoyed each of these films. You'll go wrong with none of them. There is no requirement to read the ""Pressfield Histories"" in any order. Start at the bottom and go to the top or vice versa. Makes no difference. Regardless of your approach you will emerge wiser than when you began and you will acknowledge that the experience and the time spent on these books was worthwhile."
2,Disappointing,"Having read several of Pressfield's books, I bought this one with high expectations. Unfortunately, it was so far below the standard he has set with books like ""Gates of Fire,"" that I couldn't finish it. There simply wasn't enough action to maintain my interest between the endless exchanges between the protagonist and his camp follower wife. It's as if the romantic sub-plot (and the exposure of the cultural lessons therein) became more important than the war itself.I also felt Pressfield was trying much too hard to draw the parallel between Alexander's campaign in Afghanistan and the current fight there, with the result that I began to question the credibility of much of the historical context he provided. Such detail is central to his style, so as it deteriorated, so did this book.I look forward to his next novel and hope he can get back to the originality which made his first books so enjoyable."
2,There was nothing else to read,"I read this novel in about 8 hours -- a day's travel from Denmark to Madrid. Many of the critical points have been made already, so I'll not reiterate. My objection is to the story itself -- fictional (good fictional) accounts of men in battle have already been done. Homer, Norman Mailer, and Michael Herr have already trod this path that the author takes us on. There is very little new insight into the (a)morality of combat, a soldier's first exposure to brutality, fear, sense of honor, etc. The story wasn't all that fascinating either. The ending is fairly predictable and unsatisfying. A further disturbance for a historical novel is the reference to many anachronisims -- military intelligence, battalions, forward elements -- these did not exist in Alexander's army. So, if you can get the book for free, and you've nothing else to do to pass the time, then you may have a good read."
1,21st Century story With a Sarissa,"My hobby is Greco-Roman history and I will read almost anything relating to the time period. This is one book though that I can't recommend. It has a poor plot, B movie characters, character development which would make a romance novel look good and ""Macedonian slang"" which makes one queasy.It reads like some movie script trying to mirror our present fight in afgahnistan full of Christian-Muslim concepts and musings. That would be fine if it did't try to pass itself off as a historical novel, which it isn't.If you thought 300 was historically accurate, you'll love this book."
2,"Not bad, but not equal to Gates of Fire","The problem with The Afghan Campaign is that it felt like an allegory of our current Afghanistan War based in ancient times. Could all of this have happened? Sure, but it felt like Pressfield had a checklist of attributes of the current war that he needed to attribute to this campaign of the distant past. It did not really feel like I was taken back to these times as was the case with Gates of Fire - which I consider the finest historical fiction novel ever produced."
3,An interesting read for the average history buff,"I've been really interested in Alexander the Great lately and I'm also Afghan so this book seemed like a natural read for me. The depiction of Afghan temperament and thinking seemed to be pretty dead on to me although I didn't recognize any of the Afghan words or names used. I don't know if it's because I'm a Dari speaker and the words were Pashto or archaic/ancient words but the behavior of the Afghan characters were very believable.Although it may disappoint hard core history buffs or those looking for an ultra-authentic book it's an interesting read especially if you're interested in Alexander the Great or the confluence of cultures, etc. The ending I will admit was a bit disappointing but not enough to spoil the book."
4,First of a Kind for Me,I've never been much on reading historical fiction so this book was a new experience for me. I did like it. It had a gripping story to tell and was hard for me to put down.
2,History Repeated,"Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"" was a wonderfully rendered account of the Spartan stand against the Persian army at Thermopylae. In ""The Afghan Campaign"" Pressfield continues to plumb the ancient world for material. In this novel, however, what Pressfield delivers is an allegory of the US experience in Vietnam, but 2,300-odd years removed. There are better works of fiction available for the US experience in Vietnam. Moreover, Pressfield's story line is predictable and often repetitive."
2,Boring,"This novel was boring! The writing was vapid, and lacking in good historical detail. It is written from a foot soldiers perspective, which means the reader learns very little of the larger historical and strategic concerns. It was poor enough I didn't finish it. Save your money and look for it at the library if you are still inclined to read it."
3,A Cautionary Tale,"Didn't enjoy it as much as I did Gates of Fire, but it did shed a lot of light on the fate of armies invading Afghanistan."
5,Like being there for the making of history,"Steven Pressfield transports readers to another time and place like no author I've read since James Clavell's Shogun. Having read each of his previous novels, I've been anxiously waiting for ""The Afghan Campaign."" It's exceeded my every expectation. He puts flesh and bone on the historical skeleton of Alexander's campaigns, then fills the veins with blood. If you want to understand why Afghanistan became a graveyard for the Soviet army, or gain a whole new level of sympathy and respect for American troops serving there now, read this book. And if you're a writer or a would-be writer, watch how this master of the craft makes a foreign landscape become so real that you can almost remember having been there yourself.One warning: if you do pick up ""The Afghan Campaign,: you might also want to get some Visine, because once you start reading, it's probably going to be the middle of the night before you finally put it down."
2,Historical Anachronism,"I love the genre, but was deeply disappointed by this book. Mr. Pressfield would have done better to write of the current war in Afghanistan, as he insists on imbuing his Macedonian characters with utterly modern mindsets regarding honor, and the treatment of enemy combatants. In a period of time when life was cheap, and death a common sight even without war, Mr. Pressfield would have us think that the soldiers of Alexander lay awake at night, worrying over the fate of the villagers whose homes they've razed. Too much hand wringing to be remotely believable for the period. I felt embarrassed for the author."
1,"Horrible, Just Horrible.","Having read Gates of Fire, Tide of War, and The Virtues of War I eagerly tore into this book. After knocking off 100 pages rather quickly my pace then slowed to a crawl, I couldn't take it anymore it was just too painful. The whole story is devoid of any charismatic figure, the main character is incredibly annoying and his cohort Lucas is even more pathetic. If you want to read 350 pages of an ongoing conversation about emotions, feelings, and stupidity then this is for you. There are about 3 action scenes in this book and they are described briefly in a paragraph each. It also seems that Pressfield wanted to whip this one out, the writing is incredibly dry and just pain horrible.I could not wait to put this down. I almost gave up on it and threw it away around page 200, this would have been one of the rare honors I reserve for absolutely horrible books.This makes me question whether I should buy Last of the Amazons or save my money for something better."
3,"Adequate, not up to ""Gates of Fire""","Interesting, but lacks the impact of Gates. One gets the feeling this project was rushed into press to take advantage of current events. BOrrow it from the library, do not invest in it."
1,Blue Screen of Death,"This does not work under win XP. It seems to work, but frequently crashes the OS with the infamious windows ""Blue Screen of Death"".This is even true with the latest drivers downloaded from the IOGear web site as of 4/2005.IOGear tech support does not respond to error reports on this device.RUN AWAY!"
2,Poor driver support,I can't find updated driver for Mac Os Lion. I found info. in some discussion groups but not in IOGEAR page.
4,Good device works great for what I have needed it for!,"Good: well made works well with phone systems particularly Iwatsu. Have used it for fuel systems and portable data collectors. Works great every time.Bad: UPDATE THE DRIVER the one on the disk does not work well in XP SP1-2 runs fine in SP2, get the latest driver though as always recommendedUgly: Its pretty ugly in itself and limited driver functionality straight out of the box until you get the latest driverOverall: Decent product,decent value. For the applications that I have used it for with an updated driver it worked great!4 out of 5 starsIOGear needs to seriously get their act together on drivers. they make a lot of good products but don't include the correct or even working drivers with the devices half the time."
5,If only it were always this easy...,"Product exactly as advertised, billing painless and super duper fast shipping. Incredibly stoked about the transaction."
3,"Oh well, works in Win ME, and somewhat in XP","I regret having to amend my previous recommendation. The adapter still works fine on my laptop in Win ME, but in Win XP on my desktop it has some problems. When I plug in the adapter, sometimes XP puts it in COM4, but sometimes COM5. Either way, it will not work unless I reboot XP with the adapter connected. I think this is an XP problem, but it certainly makes using the adapter less convenient. I have found Win XP to be about as awful as previous versions of windows ... it is true that it seldom goes blue screen ... but I still have to reboot a couple of times a day, and hardware installation is still ""plug and pray"". To think Bill Gates is the richest guy in the country ... maybe Marx was right after all."
1,Driver causes Windows XP to crash,"I bought this even though the driver installation instructions for use with Windows XP on the IOGear website were suspicious. They say that during installation a warning will come up that says the driver is not certified for Windows XP and shouldn't be installed, but that you should ignore the warning and install the driver anyway. It also says the driver was updated in June 2003, but looking at the driver file itself it is dated September 14, 2000. I installed it warily and the device worked okay at first, but after putting my PC in standby and then waking it up again the serial port no longer worked and when trying to use it again I got my first ever blue screen crash in Windows XP. So if you use Windows XP and want to still be able to put your PC in standby or hibernate without crashing then avoid this product until they actually have a working and certified Windows XP driver for it."
1,I didn't listen to you all...,"Bought this thinking that it would work with Win XP. Nope.It does not. One of the previous posts made a reference to another model that does work with XP, and I bought that one as well. That DID work. This IOGEAR converter ""out of the box"" does not. I am sure if I dig deeper and download different drivers, change settings.. I can get it to work, however it is NOT plug and play with Win XP on a Acer one Netbook.Go with the other model listed in the previous comments (I forget the model, however, it is white, and like $12-$15) and works out of the box with XP."
4,Works good,We bought this to replace one that we had to give to my brother. It is overpriced but works fine
1,"Doesn't work on modern OS X, or Linux","Didn't work on OS X (Mountain Lion and Lion). Installed the latest driver. It simply does not work. Tried it under a Linux VM. Works a little, but very unreliably. Bought two others from different manufacturers, both worked fine on Linux and OS X with no issues whatsoever.This isn't just a case of a bad unit. I bought two, from different stores, and both failed to function. Just not a good product, basically. Don't bother buying.Go with either the ""Plugable"" (sic) unit, or any unit based on the FTDI chipset. They both work fine on Mac/Linux."
3,It is not so good with Win 7,Did not work on my windows 7 machine. We tried all of the patched and the manufacturer of the device said that Windows 7 operating system does not work so well with converter cables.
4,While this is a good product,"The included driver does not work with MAC OSX 10.8. I tried this on multiple MAC's and all required open source drivers to work. Once that is sorted out, this thing does it;s job. The drive I was using did not lite the little LED so at first I had to make sure it was seen by opening the CLI and looking in the /dev directory"
4,Great Device,"Just purchased my 10th IO gear USB-serial adapter. I have been using these for 4 years or so. We use these for programming access to PLC's, drives, and other industrial automation equipment. No problems with 32bit XP or Windows 7. Have not tried with other Operating Systems. We frequently use 2 or 3 adapters at one time on a single laptop. Great device."
4,Windows 7 64-bit - get the (real) latest driver!,"I have been using this device on Windows XP for almost a year with no problems, recently I moved to Windows 7 64-bit, where it was also working fine, for a few days...Upon using Windows XP Mode (or any Virtual PC) the system would BSOD.I determined it was the Windows 7 driver from the iogear web site ""GUC232A_Win7_3.3.7.131"". Despite having a release date of ""Feb 2011"", the driver was, in fact, from 2009.I found a March 2011 driver (uc232a_win7_xp_vista_v1.0.075.zip) on the ATEN site (I am guessing they actually make the hardware and OEM's it to iogear - their part number ""uc232a"" is suspiciously close to ioGear's ""guc232a""...)Bottom line - I am now a happy camper, again, with this USB-Serial adapter, just not with the (currently) available drivers from iogear.I have notified them via a web form, hopefully they will update the support site download soon."
1,Does not work with XP64 bit,"When I plugged it in it attempted to install automatically and failed. Then I went to manually install it and found there were no drivers listed for XP64bit. I tried some of the other drivers, but none worked. I called technical support and told them I couldn't find any XP64 drivers. They told me to re-install it using the proper drivers. I told them I couldn't because there were none available on their website. They told me to go to their website and type in the model number of the device (GUC232A) which I did. Then they said to down the correct driver. I said ""There is no XP64 bit driver listed here."" They paused for a long time and then said ""Sorry, we have no XP64 bit driver for this."""
3,It does work with XP,We downloaded the latest version of the driver form the ATEN website (UC-232A) it's version 1.5 and now doesn't blue screen as soon as we shutdown the application readin it.
4,XP/Win 2000 user,"I bought mine in BestBuy store and tried it on both Dell Latitude D600/win XP and Dell desktop/win 2000 with GPS device (Trimble Placer 450).It worked better than expected since Windows XP recognized new USB hardware and showed me new COM4 port in Device Manager instantly. No need for installation CD that is btw. supplied with the cable. I could instantly get data to the HyperTerminal application.The only thing I do not like is the price. I would go for the cheaper, but had to have the cable immediately, therefore I purchased it in the store."
4,Two Radio Programming with IOGear Guc232A,"We have tested almost half a dozen USB to Serial converters over the past few years.Most of the devices on the market did not work reliably when ""Reading"" or ""Writing"" Icom, Kenwood, or Motorola radio programs to various mobile and portable radios. For a long time we continued to use older computers with serial ports.Almost all modern laptops have no serial ports yet the radio program interfaces are still RS-232 hook-ups.This IOGear device is THE best solution we've found so far. As suggested in the loading instructions....keep to the original comport for which the device is first established. Technician Philip Burrington Niles Radio Communication."
1,BAD buggy faulty lame flawed ancient XP driver DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This USB serial port sucks. That would be zero stars if I could. It works OK for a while, but -- for example -- after a few hundred blocks of 1063 ASCII characters, it starts delivering bytes out of order! The only XP driver I can find for this, from [...], DriverGuide, aten-[...], or anyGooglewhere, is the ATEN USB to Serial Bridge, version 2.0.0.18, dated 2003. (Debugged by disconnecting block-ASCII source, attaching PC Hyperterminal, typed in 'x', 'x', 'y', delivered 'L', 'M', 'N' -- previous characters from now-disconnected source! Isolated to the adapter by swapping my block-ASCII source cord to the other, ""real"" COM1, got hours of flawless I/O.) What a way to waste a day debugging cables, peripherals, VB.net code, etc., when the interface was the culprit all along!I'm going to try try KeySpan next; wish me luck."
1,Worthless under OS X and IOGEar tech support is useless too,"IO Gear is clueless and offers me no help. If the LED is on they're happy! This does not work under OS X 10.5.7 on an Intel iMac. Can't say about any other mac's. The IO gear package says OS X is supported, wrong!Don't waste you time on this, many other OS X users are happy with a Keyspan USA-19HS."
1,Do not buy this for a Mac OSX computer,"Do not buy this for your Mac OSX computer.I needed to sync my old Palm V with my new MacBook Pro, and I had a choice between this IOGear serial-to-USB converter or a Keyspan device which was $5 more. I bought this first, and after hours on the phone and online with combinations of IOGear, Palm, and finally in-peson with Apple people, I determined that the driver was just not working with MAC OSX.After returning this device and purchasing a Keyspan one, I am happily using my Keyspan USA19HS."
4,Don't put more than one IOGEAR GUC232A on a system,"I have spent hours and hours testing these devices. They work fine under most circumstances. They are low power devices as explained in a review by somebody else. Put one of them on a computer and as long as the electrical ground is good between the computer and the device sending and/or receiving the data, they work flawlessly. Also, they have problems with long cable runs. If you put two or more on a computer, you can be assured that your system will crash as soon as you start sending large amounts of data through both devices. You system will crash even if the data are not sent simultaneously.Oh yes, forget support from IOGEAR. You will either get a non-answer or no answer."
2,"Poor Hinge Quality, Poor Fit","Very disappointed in the fit of the two halves of the box. Once leveled and mounted, I discovered the front door has to be aggressively slammed closed to work as the two halves of the box do not line up properly. Overall quality of the hinge mechanism is fair at best."
5,Nice Box,Nice to have a sturdy KEY box to organize all the home keys. Glad to see that it wasn't a monster size box and easy to hide away.
5,Great Key Box,"This key box works great. It was easy to mount (I used my own anchors). If someone really wanted to get in, they could probably destroy the box and get to the keys, but there would be no question about what happened. For what I needed, and the price, this was perfect."
5,Sally's Seaweed,"I picked this seaweed because it's not loaded with garlic. I tried another brand that listed garlic as an ingredient and it reeked of it, enough that my cabinet smelled of garlic for weeks afterward and the fish wouldn't eat it. Also, this is a slow dissolving algae so the Pleco can eat most of it before it floats to the top.I tried seaweed used in the making of Sushi and that dissolved almost immediately.I think Sally's is the best for the money."
4,Technically Amazing but...,"OK, there's no question this guy can play the heck out of the guitar. And taking on a song like ""Magical Mystery Tour"" on solo guitar? That's ambitious. Latarski does some very nifty arranging work on ""Norwegian Wood"" and his versions of ""Let It Be"" and ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" are so full you'll hardly notice the lack of vocals. But doesn't every jazz guitarist play ""Blackbird"" just to show off? One star off for that and the obligatory cover of ""Yesterday"" - a song we've all heard just too many versions of already."
3,DECT 6.0,"Physically, the phone looks good. The size is small and light and the feel is good.I am quite irritated by the phone's always losing contact with the base. Often times, the phone is in ""search mode"" and the only way for the signal to come back is to unplug and replug the base. So, I always need to check the phone whether it has a signal or not.The battery that comes with the phone are two AAA batteries which are rated at 600ma each. They run out really quick. Just leave the phone out of the base/charger overnight and it goes on ""low batt""! I suggest that you chnage the battery to the newer 1000ma batteries now available at any electronics store. It holds double the charge.The DECT system really irritates me. It's as if you are using a duplex phone. Everytime you speak, the phone seems to change frequencies.Gone are the days when the simple cordless phones were so efficient."
1,Just horrible,I was highly disappointed at this play. This is in my opinion by far DT Worst play. Not to mention why did Sam have on the same jeans Throughout the whole play????????
3,Ok. Definitely not his best work.,David Talbert has done better work. This was somewhat boring and the actors lacked chemistry. Wait for this on Netflix.
4,Pretty good film...But maybe better than pretty good just don't re-call,"Watched this too long ago to remember the specifics, But after pulling it from my collection and reading the prompts can say it is worth adding to your collection"
5,Revenge say what,"Unfortunately we all have made choices that we had to live by but it is jacked up when your choice hurt others. I am glad to see that what goes around could come back around if you are not thoughtful of others feelings. Everything will always work out the way somebody wants, it just might not be YOu!"
5,Bettyboop Girl,Thanks for the prompt shippment. I return home from vaction package was on my door waiting patiently. Can wait to see if any other will be out soon that i have not reviewed.
3,Factual review and comparison to skillet,"The facts: It arrived as shown in the picture. It weighs the same as a 12"" Analon non stick skillet (frying pan). The pan heats evenly but is bulky not heavy when in use. The bottom of the pan doesn't have a solid piece of metal so it looks and feels like a frying pan with wok like edges. The glass lid does fit in the 12"" skillet. Guessing it will last an average non stick pans life of about 2 years. Same finish as the the other Anolon pans I own.Background: This super pan was ordered and used for two weeks in conjunction with new Anolon Advanced 10"" and 12"" skillet. I ordered this pan because it had alot of mixed bias reviews so I wanted to leave a review of the facts.Bottom Line: I would recommend this ultimate pan to a friend who needs a non stick wok or a lid to fit a 12"" skillet."
2,doesn't last long,"So far I have purchased two such pans. In the first 1~2 months, the pan performs excellent, non-stick, easy to clean. But after about 4 months, they started to have scratches and be sticky. We use the pan twice a day.Now I want a change and stop buying this pan."
2,Doesn't Last,"I got a set of Anolon cookware a few years ago. I really like the shape of this piece, but the coating is coming off and probably getting in the food we cook in it now. I'm going to hopefully throw out all of my Anolon cookware as soon as I can replace it with stainless and cast iron. I think it's totally not worth buying nonstick anything except maybe one cheap $20 or $30 10"" or 12"" skillet that you can buy new every few years. It's not worth buying $500 worth of nonstick cookware when you have to replace all of it every few years. Stainless and cast iron last FOREVER. Some of it may be more expensive, but you'll never have to buy new stuff again. I definitely regret buying Anolon nonstick."
3,"12"" pan","Nice and deep but I wish it was a 12"" fry pan with lid that had a larger bottom. This bottom is to small for my use."
4,Anolon Cookware,Good pan although you have to sit it correctly on stove top can overbalance easilyGreat heat transfer and easy to clean
4,Good Value on a Quality Pan,"I have used this pan only 3 times so far, but I really like it. I looked around quite a bit and I think it's a good value. The non-stick properties were very good. I have cooked Eggs, Potatoes and fish. Nothing stuck. Super easy cleanup. Not made in China. I think it's made in Thailand. I prefer that to the more expensive Calphalon which was made in China. The pan is deeper than I was expecting. You could make a load of something good in it. The only reason I did not give it the full five stars is that I have not had it very long at this point."
5,Best pan for my needs,"I've owned this pan for over a year now and I use it multiple times a week. I've cooked everything from omlets to chili and it cooks and cleans up like a dream. I've used it on both electric and gas ranges and have not had any complaints with regards to heat distribution. I always use silicone cooking utensils so I have not had an issue with chipping or scratching. I have also always handwashed the pan, although I have put the lid in the dishwasher on occasion to no ill effects. Overall, this pan has done everything I require of it and is well worth the money I spent. Very pleased with my purchase and I would buy another if I had to."
5,Ultimate skillet,"Superb skillet! I did a lot of research for a 12-inch skillet, and thisis the best bargain! It is deep, beautiful, functional, and cooks likea dream. The non-stick surface is Autograph 2, the very best Teflonby DuPont. The only thing missing is a helper handle, but you wouldneed to get a comparable Calphalon pan, which costs more. As with allnon-stick cookware, I never put it in the dishwasher. You can, butwhy? It will shorten the life on the non-stick over time. I just usea nylon pillow pad, which is not abrasive, along with dish soap.This non-stick is safe for metal utensils, but why use them? Tomaximize its life, and it should last for years, I always use nylonspatulas. On top of all else, it has a lifetime warranty. Get thisskillet. You will love it, too!"
5,The best piece of cookware I've EVER owned.,"I was a bit skeptical at what I could make in this since it was a ""wok""... but my gf showed me that I could use it for many different types of food. I've cooked taco beef, pasta, fried rice, burgers, stir fry, eggs, omlets, etc. You can cook pretty much anything unless you absolutely need a flat surface. Everything cooks really fast such as boiling water. Quality is great and the lid helps cook everything fast by creating some pressure within the wok. If you want one pan that can almost do it all, this is the one to get."
4,great pan,"I am a fan of Analon, though this stir fry pan seems much lighter than the saute pans. The shape is great for so many uses and I would definitely recommend it. I have only had this pan for a month and will see how well it wears. My Analon saute pans lasted for over 4 years, about as good as it gets for a nonstick surface."
5,"Good ""everyday"" pan","I was looking for a pan that had higher sides like a saute pan, a handle for tossing around the food, a lid and also enough of a flat bottom that it could serve as a fry pan. This is it. I use this pan all the time.I can't even fault it for not being dishwasher safe."
3,"Just the facts, ma'am","It just arrived so I have no comments on its utility or durability. But before I forget, I want to post the actual dimensions. That would have helped me a LOT if anyone - including the manufacturer - had bothered to do so. This is a 12"" pan measured across the top. It is a 6.25"" pan measured across the flat bottom. The sides curve up from there, to a height of 3.25"". The handle is 7.5"" long, with 4.5"" of that insulated."
5,Outstanding Pan!,"This pan is awesome! My parents have had this pan for many years, and I asked them for one just like it for my birthday present this year. I am a 46 yr old avid cook who owns an entire collection of ""All Clad"" and non-stick ""Emerile Ware"" by All-clad, so I am used to good cooking pans. I can cook pasta, to perfect omelets, and a mean stir-fry all in this pan. Extremely versatile and well made."
4,Good quality pan,"I was looking for a replacement for my wok pan which I've had over twenty years. It was hard to choose, but after reading reviews for various pans, I decided on this one. Overall, I really like the pan. It's a great size for stir-fry and I love that it comes with a lid. That's a helpful feature because I always had to use a large plate for my other pan whenever I wanted to keep the meal warm a few minutes. My one complaint is that it doesn't come with a second handle because when the food is in the pan it is quite heavy."
3,Good.. But need some more perfection,"The quality of the product is good. The issue with this is bit heavy, some time yo feel very hard to carry and transfer the food. It should have had another small handle on the other side. The lid is made of glass.. If you are a person careless about handing the cooking stuffs i wouldnt recommend this... Since i faced a hard time to clean the glass pieces when i droped the lid on the floor :)"
5,Wonderful,I purchased this for a gift and the recipient was thrilled and has rave reviews after using this fry pan
4,Decent pan,Good all around pan that can be used for anything. I like the fact that i do not need to add oil. I only need the oil when i am looking for flavor. It is a good size for sauteing veggies.
5,My go-to pan,"I wrote a similar review for the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick 3.5-Quart Covered Straining Saucepan with Spouts, which is my go-to pot. (It is so handy with the strainer!) I've had this pan for over a year and love it! I was thinking of getting a wok and my husband got this as a present for me instead. I agree with other reviewers that it is heavy and would be nice to have a helper handle (same for the pot) but it works so well, is easy to clean, and convenient. The high sides are great for EASY sauteing of veggies, fried rice, and anything else. I also love the silicone handles which don't get hot and the glass cover which lets you see the food inside. A thumbs up! I have the full Anolon advanced professional set and it is great but find that I use this and my pot over my other pieces."
3,Anolon Advanced Hard Nonstick 12 inch Pan,"In the pictures of this product, one picture shows what appears to be a straight sided pan. Whereas, all the other pictures are of a pan with rounded looking sides. Has anyone else noticed this? Or is it just me? I would like to know this before I buy one.Thanks. Richard"
3,Great Nonstick Pan....edited review Now a year later,"Very satisfied with this Nonstick 12-inch Covered Pan.I have cooked everything from a Ribeye to Stir-fry to eggs with no oil needed.Great slowly sloping/rounded sides with flat bottom.Very heavy glass lid with great 'gripping' handle.Excellent 'gripping' handle also.HIGHLY recommend........especially for the price!EDIT AFTER ONE YEAR:1)The non-stick surface wore so BADLY on the bottom of the inside cooking surface and I do not use any longer for fear safety.Very sad since this has to be my favorite pan of all time.2)Also, Beware that the 'non-padded' part of the handle end gets very HOT.They need to make the 'hanger' part of the handle covered also.It is almost impossible not to touch this part of the pan when cooking (poor wording but I hope that you get the point)CONSIDERING ALL OF THIS, I LOWER MY 'LOVE IT' TO 'IT'S OK' AND THAT WOULD BE PAST TENSE, UNFORTUNATELY"
2,Not for Lilliputians,Great advice on how to chose between buying the yacht or starting a new Fortune 500 company. The advice in the book is targetted more to fat cats and established business people than to people who are just starting to grope for their life's direction.
5,Yes You Should,"Having recently taken the plunge to start my own business after years of thinking about, but avoiding due to the risk, I only wish that Free Gulliver had been printed earlier. This little book would have provided me with a map of where I was and where I wanted to be. After reading it now, it does offer clarity that I have made the right choice. Free Gulliver has helped me set my goals and plan my next steps. I would highly recommend this book to anyone thinking of, or already making big changes in their business or personal lives."
3,Wrong bike,"The company sent the wrong bicycle but was very accomodating to pick it up and give me a full refund, which I truly appreciated. I rate them very good."
4,FOBUS IS NICE------BUT---------------,"BECAUSE OF THE GLUTTINOUS BUYING OF ALL THE CRAZY SCARED PEOPLE, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY 75D YET. VERY DISGUSTING. DO YOU MAKE A HOLSTER FOR THE WALTHER PPQ 9MM ?"
5,A wonderful title in a wonderful series,"""The Aramaic Bible"" is an outstanding reference work which is indispensible for any serious student of the Hebrew Bible. The Targums were Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible interspersed with rabbinic commentary. The Targums, which date to the middle of the first millenium and earlier, provide insights as to how the Jews (and some early Christians) actually interpreted the texts. Until now, it was difficult for someone not versed in Aramaic to have access to these documents; thus the appearance of not just a translation, but a scholarly edition is most welcome.I used several of these volumes (including this one) in seminary while doing exegetical papers and found them informative beyond belief."
3,A pretty good story.,"This book accurately describes the difficult life of sharecroppers in the rural South. The author, however, does not tell her story begrudgingly or with any apparent political intent, but instead simply describes the day-to-day life of her family. Though most books written about the Mississippi Delta and labor exploitation focus exclusively on African Americans, this book addresses the rather common phenomenon of the white tenant farmer enslaved by poverty and the greed of some plantation owners. Her story is a common story and most people who lived through similar experiences probably never felt their story was worth telling. It definitely was and this book should be required reading for students of southern history. The book is not a polished or sophisticated novel, but an accurate depiction of a struggling family through the hardest of times."
2,Dont waist your time,this is so bright its cute but not at the same time wait for it to be 15 dollars and then it will be worth it
4,Good cases but...,The cases are great but the reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because on arrival some of the cases were broken or chipped.
1,MEMOREX CD/DVD CASES,THESE ARE NOT MEMOREX CD/DVD CASES. THEY ARE BULCK PRODUCED CD/DVD CASES MADE IN CHINA. THE CASES DO NOT CLOSE VERY WELL. THIS IS FALSE ADVERSTISING THAT THEY ARE MEMOREX CD/DVDS WHEN THEY ARE NOT AT ALL.
3,Disappointed in Amazon,I guess the cases are ok. Just disappointed in Amazon for sending me all these cases advertised as Memorex but not packaged as Memorex. Where're you going Amazon?
1,Horrible Packaging!!! Have 4 usable cases out of 50!,"I thought at first glance that there were only 14 cases messed up.. By messed up I mean that the package must have been dropped or thrown by UPS or something and when you open the cd case it falls apart, the little plastic ends that hold the two pieces together are broken off.. After closer inspection and going through each individual one I have 4 usable cases that don't fall apart when opened.. I would suggest using bubble wrap packaging if you intend on getting your packages to your customers intact.."
3,Not recomended,My package arrived with 5 broken cases. Not worth the hasstle of returning. The cases are a little hard to open but not as bad as some reviews have indicated. Amazon definitely needs to package these better for shipping.
3,durablity issue,"Either due to poor packing or just poor workmanship, did not withstand shipping. I have thrown away about 5 so far because the corners shattered on individual cases. This was only the case with the Memorex jewel cases and not the Office Depot cases that were also slimline style and thin plastic."
2,Broken and cracked cases,Two of the CD cases arrived broken in the sealed package and I was unable to use them. About a dozen more were cracked.
3,Cheap for a reason,"I bought these cases, and when I received them, 6 of them were broken. I dont buy blank cases too often, but I have bought delicate things before, and this is the first and only item I have received from Amazon that did. In all, Im not disappointed, I looked at other reviews and a few of them said the same thing and I thought it wouldnt happen to me. As for the ease of opening, I have not had that problem. They open easily and close securely for me."
4,Worth the price,What does one need to be happy with this type of product. Simple to produce so price is the end game. This product was well priced.Nothing broken and as expected.
3,Not 5mm,"These are not 5mm thick they are about half that. Despite bubble wrap, out of the 50 I got, 6 of them were broken and a few more had cracks in them from the shipping. It would have been easier to go to the store but then you'd have to take time trying to find it and all."
2,Broken Hinges,I receive the cases and half of the 50 had broken hinges from shipping. some i had to glue and others tape.Like Amazom but will not buy adainEd Osciak
3,"Good price, arrived damaged","A very good price for this product, however Amazon does not package them very well for shipping, as noted in other reviews. Minimal packing material resulted in 4 of them arriving damaged. It wasn't bad enough to merit the hassle of returning them. I contacted Amazon and they refunded 10% off the purchase price. This was a reasonable outcome. But better packaging would avoid this whole problem for Amazon's customers."
2,CD case,Cases were fine for price paid..although cheap plastic and 4 of them were broken when received
4,"A little flimsy, good price",These jewel cases seem to be a little more fragile than other's I've used. But I like the clear plastic and the price was pretty good.
3,I was shipped 49 cases; 3 were damaged. (46 useable cases),"The shipment arrived wrapped in weak corrugated paper; no padding other than the wrapper itself. The plastic is definitely brittle, but for what they are used for, they're okay. Holds sleeves up to 7 pages; any more and it won't snap shut, but they'll still close. Of the 46 cases, all of them are being used at the moment and are performing well.I advise that you use these cases for storage only; not mobility. The plastic is too brittle for repeated use or for placing in bags and glove-boxes. If you plan on using these cases only to protect your disc collection, and are placing them in a rack or a storage box, these cases will perform well - especially for the price."
1,Did not recieve product as advertised,"The advertised picture shows clearly that the product comes in a box that I used to store my dvd's. When I received the product it was tightly wrapped in plastic NOT IN THE BOX CLEARLY AS ADVERTISED, and many of the individual jewel cases were cracked and broken apart because of the tightness of the packaging. I spent the extra money to get the box that was advertised that the jewel cases came in. I'll think twice about ordering anything from your company again."
3,Don't buy jewel cases mail-order. Ever.,"The product itself I can't fault: these are your standard slim jewel cases. But sheesh, do a lot of them arrive broken. Truth is, I've never ordered cases from any supplier (Amazon, newegg, outpost, or wherever) that didn't arrive with at least 10% of the cases cracked or broken. They just don't ship well. If they seem like a good bargain, remember that you'll lose a good percentage of them. And even if the retailer will take them back, it's never worth the bother of returning them.Add to that the shipping charge, and it starts to look like it makes more sense to buy these at your local office supply store where you can inspect them for breakage before you buy. That has been my experience, anyway."
1,Be careful from whom you order from.,The sender of this product packed the box individually and not in it's original wrapping. The order was 2 cases short and 2 more are broken.
3,handle with care,"The cases are fine but extremly fragile even if dropped on capet they break,so if you drop them on the floor or any hard surface forget it it's gone. I estimate about 20 to 30 % you may break. I don't see anything else better on the market so you just have to deal with it. ""Oh I will buy this product again""."
4,Good Cases,These are good jewel cases.I have used a lot of them from this 50 pack to store DVDs in that I have burned movies on via my DVD set top recorder and they have served the purpose very well.The only complaint about this item is that one of the jewel cases on one end was cracked when I opened the package.Other than that I was satisfied overall with the jewel cases.
1,Memorex has cut back!!!!,Memorex has stopped putting inserts in the jewel cases with the CD-R's so you have no choice but to buy the inserts separately. This has caused me to stop buying their products. Another move by big business to get more of your money!!!
2,Several came damaged,I had about 10 of them with broken brackets. It comes in a box with no protection. I would rather buy a sturdier case next time.
2,old style keyboard one must buy an adapter to work... sold as spillproof?,"I ordered a keyboard which is nothing more than an older style keyboard which will not work with a new model computer. I also read product is hinted at being spillproof? I wanted my money back as soon as I found out how much a converter cost, so one can access a new model computer.I realize part of the problem is that I did not fully read the description: requires a ps2 connection which is for an older computer setup."
4,good utility for the price,"I needed to replace my OEM keyboard after six years of spills and thrills. All I wanted was a reliable unit with the same exact layout as the first one. The Logitech filled the bill at an exceptionally good price.It has performed just as needed and wanted - nothing more and nothing less.Simple, functional, all the keys in the ""right"" places."
2,Good keyboard for PS/2 NOT USB,"I searched for usb keyboards by price... this came up. Shame on me for not reading the description further because this keyboard is not USB, thus making it useless to me... WHY IS IT UNDER THE USB KEYBOARD SEARCH?"
1,Very Disappointed in Ride Quality,"Years ago replaced worn shocks on a 87 dodge D150 with Monroe Gas Magnums and it was like a new truck. Time for new shocks and thought I would try the newest from Monroe. What a mistake!Tried the Reflex on a 2002 Dakota 4X4 Quad cab. 134K on truck and though no signs of shock leaks decided to replace my shocks. Bad choice.While cornering improved, ride quality dropped dramatically. Enough that the wife now refuses to ride in the truck. New shocks are jittery on neighborhood roads and harsh to uncomfortable on more severe rough pavement. Smooth highway is a good ride but that is not the reality of daily driving.What a waste of money. I much preferred the ride of the old shocks but had thrown them out.Don't buy unless you always carry a load and suggest you ride or drive another truck with same reflex shocks before buying."
1,Been Done,This band has already been done a thousand times and still sounds like complete total a$$.
1,Returatouille,"Had to return two. The first one played great, but only lasted 1 week and then communications were lost between transmitter and car radio. The second one did not work at all. The multiplexer which controls stereo did not work and sound came out of only one speaker. The sound is great but the quality of the this transmitter does not hold up. Sorry for the bad review but I am being honest."
4,Kensington Charger - great buy,"This charger has worked well for me. It was a little difficult finding a station to tune into as I live in a metro area, but once I found the station it works just like a cd player. The only thing is traveling where you may need to find another station to tune into - not easy to do when you are driving and a little annoying. Overall, I would recommend this charger over the rest of them."
2,Didn't Work For Me,"Ordered this device based upon positive review suggesting it was one of the better of this type for mobile iPod play through car audio system. Maybe it is among the best of the FM transmitter devices, but for me the transmission was terrible (thru iPod Nano 2G). It may well be that the static and the only fair-to-bad reception variablility was due to heavy FM signal presence in the area (20 miles north of Boston), and that in a different geography things would be acceptable. I sent it back and instead went with a radio/installation package at Circuit City on a unit that had a front AUX line in for the iPod patch cord. This solution works very well for me, can be had for around $100 if you watch the ads, and does not depend on the relevant absence of ambient FM signal traffic to deliver clear tunes."
4,Works good,"Yes, it's through the radio so sound is not ideal, but that's the only option i had. Works as it should, simple to use, charges nano great. Would recommend."
5,Sounds like a CD,"For me and my location (Atlanta) this performs very well. I use 88.1 and have very little static. I find I do have to turn the volume of the radio up much more than when I listen to a CD or the radio -- but, hey, that's no problem."
4,Good deal for the price!,"I've had this item for about a month now and so far so good! I love that it charges the iPod while it plays, I didn't realize how handy a feature that would be. My only ""complaint"" so far, is that it'd be nice if it came with some sort of remote, but if I really wanted that, I could have dished out more funds. If you're wanting a quick fix for your car, I say that this would be a good pick so far. :)"
4,Better then most others,Belkin did not work in our Siena Van. The Kensington works very well. The only problem we have is reading the FM station on the transmitter. It would have been better in this vehicle if they more on the top. The presets make this easier around town.
4,Car minus antenna = Works Great,"I found that driving around Houston required constant station changing, so I decided to detach the car's external antenna and listen exclusively to my iPod while driving. To my surprise, my favorite stations still came through, loud and clear, while all the annoying little stations were gone.IMPORTANT: Be sure to occasionally check the part of the transmitter that plugs into the lighter. Mine came loose today, and all the little parts fell out on the floor of the car. I still haven't found one crucial piece.It's just a matter of making sure it's screwed on tight."
4,"Great sound, bad viewing angle","I am generally very pleased with this transmitter. The sound quality is quite good, it does a nice job of charging my iPod, and I like the preset buttons. Only problem is that, on my Subaru Legacy wagon, the cigarette lighter is down low on the front console, about knee level. From that angle, the LCD screen is almost impossible to read, as even LCD segments that are off appear to be on. The blue backlight for the LCD is also very bright in the car at night -- it would be good to be able to turn it down.Generally happy with this unit, and I understand via ilounge.com that it's about as good as they get for sound quality. But the visibility issue is a real one, depending on your car's layout."
5,iPod FM Transmitter works great!,"The Kensington 33185 Digital FM Tansmitter/Car Charger is great. I can charge my iPod battery while playing it and I can change the frequency to any one that is not in use to get great reception. Since the iPod is connected to the transmitter/charger by a 2 ft cord, I can pick it up to change selections. In other fixed postion models, I would be required to lean over to see the iPod dial. I can also hand the iPod to someone in the back seat to select what they want to hear without unplugging it. It works great for me so I gave it 5 stars!"
4,EXCELENT FOR THE PORPOUSE,"I'm from Chile, and after I checked all the reviews for this kind of article, I'm sure I took the very right turn with this one."
3,Does the job....sort of,"I live in Columbus, Ohio and had a very hard time finding an open frequency. I did manage to find one, but on rare occasions this transmitter is overpowered, even by a weak signal (especially on the west side of the city). The only thing I hated about it was that it would keep going into ""sleep"" mode, which it's supposed to do when the iPod stops playing. But it would do it even when the iPod was in the middle of a song. I finally got so frustrated with it that I yanked it out and threw it up against the dashboard. It's worked perfectly ever since, go figure. Now that that problem is fixed, it works pretty good. The sleep mode is really annoying though because I usually have to turn the radio volume up higher than normal when using the iPod. So if I'm not paying attention and the transmitter goes to ""sleep"", I get a blast of really loud static."
1,"If you plan on driving your car, don't get this",Sounds great until you start moving.. Cuts in and out. Get the tape connector instead.
2,Not really what I expected!!!,It was working at the beggining but 2 days later it was horrible.I live in New Haven area CT and I found few free frequencies but it was very bad.I have a cassete player in my other car and this fm transmitter could not even come close to a cassete one.I had to return it.
2,Turn your ipod into a record player,"I ordered this product to listen to my ipod in the car. I followed the instructions and tried it for a week, but was never able to listen to my music with out the static. I felt like I was listening to records. I wouldn't recomed this."
4,Finally something that works,The Kensington Transmitter is a great answer for the after-market ipod play. It performs outstandingly on trips where you are away from the majority of radio station markets. It is not so productive in town as there is static to deal with. Since I bought it for trips it has been great and was very cost effective.
4,better than old radio transmitter,this one is much better than my old tranmitter. i havent used it much because my ipod is broken at the moment but when i did use it there was no static. my old one which didnt charge my ipod as well as transmit radio signal would static all the time on every station i put it on. this one's great
5,FM transmitter for Video iPOD,I absolutely love this product! Easy to use. I use it all the time and I have had no problems. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive fm transmitter to use with your iPOD. I researched similar items and this seems to be not only the best buy in terms of price (others were much more expensive and did not include a car charger) but also the best product out of those available.
5,Never gotten better reception than with this transmitter,"Crystal clear reception. The only FM transmitter I've ever gotten this with. The key is to hold down the right 2 preset buttons and press up to tune it to 87.5. The ""digital"" whatever thing must work wonders because it almost sounds like I'm listening to a CD."
3,Not what I expected....,"As soon as I got this I was so excited to try it out but I was not able to get one single station where I didn't get static. I kept getting static and no music. I also tryed changing stations but no luck. I guess if you live in an area where there are not that many radio stations you might get a half decent sound. The only advanatage for me would be that it charges my ipod in the car, but that is about it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Reading the reviews, I expected the clarity to be pretty good. I was extremely disappointed. Unless the one I received was an extreme exception, the clarity on this product is well below acceptable. Lots of static, irregardless of the station. I live in an area where there aren't alot of stations, so that isn't the issue. A wired cassette adapter may not be as 'cool' as these, but I can promise you that the quality of the sound is never going to be close between the two. Amazon was great to return my full purchase price. I would simply have thrown it away rather than torturing my ears with low quality sound!"
5,Excellent,This was exactly what I was looking for...a bit of static which is alleviated wen finding another inbetween station.
1,Not worth the money,"Initial sound quality was okay - nothing spectacular, and low volume.It started making popping noises and/or working out of only one speaker after the first day.After one week, the base would no longer charge the ipod because the interior pin broke, and would no longer play through the radio. I wish I'd gone with another one, as this one failed miserably."
4,Sounds Great!,"I bought this transmitter after reading some other reviews about it on Amazon, and after trying out another brand- Xtreme Mac. This one is far superior. The direct connection through the docking port means I don't have to adjust the volume on the ipod at all. It transmits a nice, full sound, and rarely has any static. The only drawback is that I need to turn up the volume on my car radio more than usual, but I think that's pretty standard for these things. I find it works best on the Small Speaker or Flat EQ setting on my ipod. Otherwise there's a bit of static when the music/singer uses the ""s"" sound.For the price, and for the convenience of being able to use my ipod on the road, I love it!"
4,Works like a charm,"I was first surprised when I received my Kensington FM transmitter for ipod in about 2 days inspite of choosing Free Shipping (which generally amazon says it takes about 5-7 business days for shipping). I live in SF-South Bay, CA and I have had similar experience with Amazon before too, when they delivered items to me in about 2 days. So, to begin with, I give 10/10 to Amazon for doing a great job...Now..about the product. I simply love it..clear voice..No interference with other FM frequncies...easy to install and use...For anyone who expects an FM transmitter to output voice similar to your car stereo system, dont be surprised when you feel the difference...as FM transmitters are not plugged-in devices hence the quality deteriorates a bit...but I am more than happy to use as the voice quality is equivalent to any other fm channel..so works for me, and more importantly...Works like a Charm !!!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"I purchased this product out of necessitiy to use in rental cars I take on business trips. After reading the product description, I liked the fact of it having a back-lit display that would make it easier to find the correct frequency at night. The product is functional, although I noticed it loses connection with the power outlet easily if bumped. One thing that I didn't read in any of the other reviews or product description is that the unit HAS to be angled towards the driver in order to see the display. This is fine for some vehicles that angle the power outlet towards the driver, but in several cars I've used this in the power outlet is near the floor. This makes it very difficult to see what station you are on unless you get directly in front of it. Of course that's impossible to do that while you're driving. It's just one thing that really annoys me about this product."
5,awesome fm transmitter,I bought a relatively cheap (around $30) transmitter before this one and it was aweful! This is a great transmitter! Absolutely no problems with it yet. Just wish I could use it on my home stereo.
3,Disappointed with this product - the quality just isn't there,"I bought this transmitter/charger based on pretty good reviews here and at the Apple store, but I am pretty disappointed with it. Even when you find a ""good"" station to transmit on, quality is extrememly poor and contains heavy static. This problem gets even worse when you are listening to music with lots of higher pitch sound. I have actually stopped using it to listen to music in the car because of the annoying static and hissying sounds, and now only use it to charge when I need to (the only good use for this unfortunately)."
2,Just PLain Insufficient,"I bought this based on the good reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, on every free frequency there was an unacceptable level of static/hiss no matter how I played with the volume and equalizer settings on my iPod. My understanding is that transmitter makers were, for a time, boosting the power of their products until they recently were reprimanded by the FCC. This would explain the dichotomy between the prior reviews and my experience. I bought a cassette adapter instead, which works far, far better."
3,"easy to use, sometimes with static","I drive a Hyundai Elantra 2006, use a ipod mini first generation, in one of the Big 3 cities of America. It's easy to use, you don't need to crank up the volume to listen to things, but from time to time depending on the location, there IS static. One good thing is once you set the dial, you don't have to ever reset it. It remembers which station you chose. Perhaps some other device is totally static free. I only tried this, and it fits my need. I don't mind static from time to time."
2,an ok item,"the Kensington transmitter and car charger seems like a ideal purchase for i-pod users...the main problem is that if you are outside of urban and built up areas you are constantly retuning to get a half decent signal. It has the same flaws as FM radio which is that if you have a good transmitter near by you will have crystal clear performance and the further you get away the more white noise and fuzz you will get. We used it on a long trip from san diego to las vegas and then to near LA and back to SD.If you are using it were there are no mountains plenty of radio stations that have good separation in there frequencies i would buy it, but if you need it for long journeys i would forget it...As all the above flaws will be very irritating"
4,very good...,very reliable so far... have had no issues whatsoever with this item. The only thing is that the adapter plug is fixed and depending on the car outlet it is very difficul to see the display
3,Not so much for the roadtripping alone,"I was very impressed with the sound quality and ease of use until I left the county for a 1.5 hour drive on my own to L.A. When I had to find a new station it was actually very difficult to adjust the transmitter because of the display's position to the driver's seat. You need to be at an equal level with the display in order to see the chosen station correctly or you will only see ""888.88"" if you are looking at it from an angle. In my Civic the charger sits pretty low and I didn't have a passenger to help out. I gave it a few attempts but doing this at 80 on the freeway isn't very productive.This may not be an issue for some in which case I'd highly recommend this product and haven't run into any other problems yet."
4,Not bad,"I bought this to replace my Griffin RoadTrip. (it broke)It's an excellent little device in my truck where the antennais in the front. In my car it had too much static and is almosttoo annoying to use, but the antenna is in the back.This was a lot easier to plug into my vehicles than the RT.It was also easier to navigate my ipod since it's just on a cordrather than plugged into a cradle like the RT."
4,Works well in my car...,"I recently purchased a 2007 Hyundai Sonata and unfortunately it does not yet come with iPod integration. After reading some reviews I concluded that this product might do the trick as it is not easy to fiddle with the stock stereo in this car. Using the two button trick this little guy has the ability to play on frequencies that your car stereo can pick up but you are evidently not allowed to transmit over (sub 88.1). The pickup by my car radio has been nearly flawless. Excellent stereo delivery. Every once in a long while I get interference, likely from another driver that has the same or similar product but it is usually fleeting. My one quibble is that the buttons and the screen should be reversed, with the buttons on the bottom and the lcd on the top but it is nothing major. You also can't program to one of the sub 88.1 frequencies, but it is worth the 5 seconds at car startup to do so."
3,doesn't work with touch,works excellent as a transmitter but it will not charge an ipod touch in the car
1,Self Destructed,"It worked once when first connected and then it self destructed. I get nothing but static. Static on every station option. Static on every IPOD setting. This FM Transmitter is a big, big disappointment."
3,significant degradation in sound using any adaptor,"THis unit makes your ipod sound like you are listening to a non high fidelity fm station. Having said that, any ipod connection that is done by fm transmitter will sound the same. Its a shame all cars arnt pre wired for mp3 /ipod type players."
4,Kensington iPod transmitter/charger,"This device works pretty good. I like having 3 preset stations that I can go right too. I use 3 FM presets to dial in all three so if I get a messy signal I can switch to another easily. The other thing that is nice is the bandwidth of the device. I have a much broader choice of stations going from the low end of the FM spectrum to the high end. One downside is the angle of the display is fixed, so it depends on where your adaptor plugs in whether you can easily read the siplay or not. Once you have your presets done, it's no big deal. Good device, sound quality is right there and it seems to have good power to overcome any sideband issues."
4,Kensington FM transmitter for iPod,I bought it this past summer. It works very well. the key is to find a frequency that has no interference. I use it mostly to listen to podcasts from iTunes.
2,Bad investment...Stay Away,"This has to be one of the worst FM Transmitter out on the market. If you have your car antenna that is located at the back of your car, this product will produce the worst kind of static. Can you say AM radio? I will say that if your car's antenna is located in the front, it may work at a decent level but you will hear the static. Forget this product and buy yourself the DLO all-in-one transpod. This is a far superior product. I live in Dallas and the DLO works great given the few open stations available."
2,iGriffen better FM transmitter,"I live in Charlotte, NC and bought this as a replacement for my Griffin FM transmitter: (Griffin 9781) (had a flaky connection to ipod) and the static/white noise I receive from the Kensington transmitter is much worse than the Griffin."
4,Important Info re: FM Transmitters,"I received this as a gift and have nothing but praise for the clarity and fidelity. Kensington really did a good job with this unit. However, a previous reviewer recommended leaving the unit in 24/7 to alleviate stress on the 12v connection. I tried this for several days and did not see any appreciable draw from the car battery (the indicator light stays on and the unit transmits even w/o the key on). However, my keyless entry transmitter was severely impeded and my remote starter was useless with this unit plugged in. I didn't try various frequencies - I just unplugged it, and saw my keyless transmitter quadruple+ it's effective distance and my remote starter work from within the house again. Just a heads up for reference - YMMV."
5,"AWESOME - FIRST CHANNEL WORKED LIKE A CHARM...in Detroit, anyway...","I, too, read a lot of the online reviews and did my research on FM transmitters. This seemed to receive the best reviews. I was currently using an old Belkin TuneCast II which was absolutley worthless.So, I read the reviews and made my purchase. As soon as the Amazon.com box arrived, I ran to my car and plugged this in, picked one station and it was PERFECT! NEVER have changed the channel since! First channel worked! And I drive ALL over metro-Detroit, including outskirts of Jackson - the same channel works EVERYWHERE.Highly recommended... :)"
4,nice quality...little noise,"After researching on a lot of fm transmitters/chargers, I decided on this one. Definitely wasn't disappointed.Pros: Small size, Good Sound Quality with very little disturbance even in the Los Angeles area,Cons: Frequency can be increased/descreased in steps of .1 which doesnt make sense because my car does that in steps of .2, doesn't have any suction, cup or ipod holder so I have to look down everytime I wanna change the song.Although I am happy with the product, to be frank I wouldnt have bought it unless amazon had a weekend deal for $29 going as opposed to $44 now."
3,Not so good in Jeeps,"Own a Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd. and the unit does not work very well in it. Works excellent in both of my roomates cars but not the jeep for some odd reason. I get static, and pops.As for the transmitter itself I like the interface, the lights etc.. and it seems to be well built. Easy to use as well. I find living in LA I get alot of interference from the stations around town. I haven't been able to find any empty stations to use it on.Just figured I would let Jeep Grand owners know about this."
3,Meh...It gets the job done,"Living in New England and storing my car outside, this product's display does not deal with the cold weather too well. It scambles the numbers and makes it tough to figure out what station to tune into. After tapping the display after it warms up, you can get it to work...until you hit a bump and then it goes back to nonsense.I also have to store my iPod up in my sun visor because there is bad static if I don't. I don't know if that's because of the product or because of my car but when the iPod is up in my visor, it works great! Crystal Clear!Other than the display issue (could be my particular unit), I'd reccommed this to my friends and family because it's small and it works great."
4,Just does what it is made for...,"The fact that this FM transmitter has 3 presets makes things so easy. At times you could swear you are hearing a cd when you have no interference. I have used this for driving in between NYC and Philadelphia with minimal issues in my car. Hey if you get static problems here's a hint; change the station you are using! I highly recommend you buy this. This works better than the iTrip I have for my 3rd gen iPod. The 2 reasons I don't give this a 5 star rating are: 1) The build of this product could be better, I am waiting to break it if I get too rough with it. 2) You can't transmit outside your car (like an iTrip) because it is part of the car charger."
4,"Decent, not perfect","It is what it is. Cell phones nearby produce the usual beeps occasionally, and in traffic, it can be heard even if your phone is off. As you drive, sometimes stations come into range and interfere. Generally, if you find a decent spot near your home with good reception and scan your car stereo through the band until you find a few frequencies that have nothing but static, and program them 1, 2 and 3, then do the same on the FM Modulator, you'll be able to switch quickly if you do find noise impinging on your drive.The sound quality is OK. Not great.For an FM modulator, I believe this one to be good."
3,FM Station Background Noise,"This product requires a noiseless FM station to produce clean audio. I recommend testing the radio to be used to determine whether such stations are readily and consistently available. When used on an automobile radio station noise, including static and bleedover from adjacent station settings, might interfere with the iPOD audio differently depending upon where you drive. I found that there is a significant difference between automobile radios as to how much background noise is received on the same station settings and in the same locations."
3,"Good FM Transmitter, but broke down","Overall good FM transmitter with enough power to not show any static. However, the tip of the cigaretter adapter came loose, and I lost a small piece from inside the tip. The adapter is useless..I wish they built things to be a little more durable."
2,Not working well in Seattle,"I've yet to find a station in the Seattle area that allows me to enjoy my iPod without static. One will work just fine in north Seattle but by the time I hit Tukwila I start getting static and have to switch stations. Ditto if I head over to Redmond. I suspect no transmitter will work well if you live in a good sized city.On top of that this transmitter has some other issues. When I plug it into my car (Hyundai Elantra) I can't read the display. The jack is so low and the display face is vertical making it impossible to safely read while driving. Also the screen isn't very bright making things worse.Overall, I wish I'd saved my money to use towards a proper, iPod compatible car stereo."
4,Great signal,"After trying some crap FM tuners by Belkin and Maxell, I found this transmitter works great, even in downtown Savannah. The only drawback is a sharp hiss at the end of certain words or sounds."
5,Rockin' on the boulevard!,"I bought two of these, one for each car. The sound quality is fantastic and my iPod is now always fully charged."
5,Works as advertised,"Before I bought this product I did some research on internet. Kensington was advertised to have the lowest interference and best sound quality, and it is true.PRO: The sound is clear, and there are no interferences from engine or other sources. It has full range dial (instead some other models that have only preset frequencies). It can program up to three preset frequencies for fast changing. Charges your iPod while traveling. Works like a charm.CONS: none."
3,Not good in Los Angeles,Can't find a an empty station. Works well in garages but on the open road it is not so good!
3,The best I've tried so far.,"This is my third FM transmitter and the only one I didn't return. The sound is good enough that I would have given it 4 stars except that it's very difficult to read the display. I listen to downloaded audiobooks on long drives and this is the only transmitter that has been clear enough for that purpose. For music, it's even better. The fact that it charges my iPod is a major bonus."
2,Device is Barely Acceptable,"Using this in my wife's Expedition is very annoying. For some reason the cord must be placed in exactly the right position or static will drown out the music coming from the car's speakers. Note that no other electrical devices in this car (and there are a lot of them; she got every option available with the car) misbehave at all. I would not repeat this purchase, not can I recommend anyone else buy one of these. I only gave it two stars because with continual minor effort it can be made to work acceptably - however, fiddling with the cord while driving is certainly NOT a safe practice."
4,almost perfect,"I was really worried about the static with any FM transmitter. Actually when I first plugged this one I got lots of static, but after a couple of days it was working really fine. I get a little static time to time, but it's acceptable (and usually I'm very sensitive to that). Another reviewer suggested to inactivate the equalizer on the ipod, so I did; probably that helped too."
4,Kensington works,"Kensington seems to deliver what I needed...An IPOD in the car. Three FM selections...very little static, if any, and My IPOD charges and plays in my car. I would recommend this product"
5,"Great deal, it makes a huge difference!","I had an older Monster adpater that I bought over a year ago and I was always wondering why I had to crank the volume up all the way to hear what my ipod was playing. I just got this and ran to try it... and I can actually get hugely improved sound and the volume control on the ipod is actually in relation to the car stereo. Massive improvement, glad I bought it."
4,It works with 5G 60GB iPod.,"I am very happy with this device. It works very well with my 5G iPod 60GB.Sound quality is very good. Minor hiss noticeable only when you try really hard to hear it. It doesn't bother me because I listen mainly to podcasts.The easter egg trick is true, however you can not preset to those frequencies. 90.5 is the frequency I can use all the time around my area. I drive between Boston, MA and Providence, RI.The blue lights doesn't bother me. Get a Nyko universal car mount to complete your car set (only $15 at KayBeeToys web site).I highly recommended it."
2,Beware if there are few unused frequencies in your area,"I purchased the Kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise. I heard and read a lot about the problems with FM transmitters, like static and audio quality but the Kensington was the best rated unit.It arrived the day before I had to take a business trip and thought it would be a great test. The first day I used it, it seemed to work great. The next day on my return trip home, all I got was static and could barely hear the music from my iPod. I tried every station I could find with little or no transmission on it, but the audio quality remained extremely poor.I am not sure if there are just too many stations broadcasting in the NYC metro area or this particular unit is defective, but since my car has a casette player I will go with casette adapter for now.If you have lots of unused frequencies, it might work in your area. Just be sure you can return it if it doesn't work out for you."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"This product works quite well. In fact, better than I had expected. The only thing I have noticed is that you can hear a little feedback on quieter pieces of music. I suspect that if you are outside of a large city, the reception would be better but I haven't tested it that far yet. However, the convenience of having all your music right there in front of you without having to deal with CDs in the car is a huge selling point for me."
2,Not as expected,"Sound transmission not very clear - lots of static. I live and work around the metropolitan Orlando, Florida area. I returned the product several days after receiving it. Purchased another type with limited channels(8)from Radio Shack that works much better."
1,Traveling static,"I was hoping to be able to plug-n-play my first iPod recently, but this is not the FM transmitter with which to do it. It's smalll and difficult to see, therefore making it dangerous during driving. Regarding static, there was so much it was distracting. I was unable to find a station without the accompanying static. Perhaps if I lived in a more rural area it would work?It wasn't worth the effort and the risk to be switching stations, trying to play my music. Looks like I will have to get my iPod hardwired into my car.The only good thing about this product is that it charged my iPod."
3,this product is decent,"while i'm not as blown away as some of the other reviewers are about this unit's clarity, it does work pretty well. the digital FM scrolling is a nice feature and for the most part the static is pretty low.however, my ipod has recently stopped working (3rd generation, 20 gig) and this occurred while it was plugged into the kensington unit while i was driving. i can't connect via usb or firewire to my computer to reformat or access any other software. i can turn the ipod one, i see the apple symbol, then i see the folder with exclamation point icon on the screen. i have tried various recovery procedures and none work. i believe the hard drive is caput. while i have no certainty that the kensington unit caused my ipod to die, this is simply a word of caution. the performance up until the time of death was satisfactory."
2,Not great,"It did the job keeping my ipod charged.For radio transmission, it was hard to see the unit's display, so changing the station while driving was out of the question. This became a problem when traveling through areas that had different radio stations (I would have to switch channels to overcome the interference).As for reception, I found the best reception when I tucked my ipod into one of the flip-down sun screens, allowing the wire to dangle down. This was annoying as well as of questionable legality (here in TX, you can get a ticket for 'obstructing the driver's view' by hanging anything from your rear-view mirror).In the end, after a year and a half, the connector for the audio (but not the power part!) no longer mated properly with the iPod, so I started getting very muffled sound - not loud enough to listen to.Time to find another transmitter (NOT this one!)..."
5,Works great!,This baby works great! I live in a large metropolitan area with lots of FM stations. This Kensington FM Transmitter is working fine for me in this environment. The iPod sound is crisp and clear over my factory in-car stereo. I'm very happy with it!
5,"I've tried the rest, this one is the best.","This little guy blows away all of the other FM iPod transmitters I've tried or owned over the years (Belkin, iTrip, Newer). It has the best sound, the least noise, and is the easiest to use. Plus, it charges my iPod. It even works great in NYC - the ultimate torture test for these things."
2,Save your money.,Save your money and by a stereo with and integrated interface. The FM transmitter just doesn't cut it in a car. To much static and you get no highs or lows. I bought an Alpine CDE-9870 with the iPod cable. It cost me a total of $150 bucks but it was well worth it. It sounds and works great. If you save your money on this your 1/3 of the way there.
2,Works well but ONLY with speakers on one side of the car,"I bought this expensive transmitter after reading several good reviews, and was very pleased with the quality of the sound. However, the sound would come out only on speakers on the right side of the car. I tried moving the socket in lots of different ways, and occasionally I got it to work. I tried using the transmitter in several different cars, and the same problem occurred. Eventually I found out a way to make it work, which was to quickly remove the transmitter from the car lighter while the ipod was playing, put it back in and then turn on the ipod. But after messing with the accessory so many times, a part screwed off and now I can't get it to work at all. Hopefully you won't encounter the same issue. The bottom line is, the quality of the sound is great but not worth the hassle."
1,Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus beats Kensington!!!!!!!,"This thing has poor sound quality! All the ""S"" and ""SH"" sounds hiss. It's irritating! And the slightest movement of your iPod produces static.ATTENTIONThose with the cigarette lighter right by the stick shift, this product is NOT for you! Can't shift to first or third with this thing plugged in. I returned this the same day I bought and exchanged it for the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus. Monster is waaaaay better! From the reviews for Kensington, I thought it was the best. I should've taken the advice from a friend and bought the Monster one instead. The Monster one feels better made than the Kensington. But the sound is 100 times better. No hissing sound or static. If you're going to buy an FM Transmitter/Car Charger, buy theMONSTER ICARPLAY WIRELESS PLUSYou'll be very happy with the Monster one...TRUST ME!!!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,VERY DISAPPOINTING. I GAVE IT AS A PRESENT AND NOW FEEL LIKE A CHEAP *******. SHOP ANOTHER BRAND.
2,broke after a couple of months,It was stuck in the cigarette lighter of the car. I was trying to get it out and I guess I pulled too hard because it broke. :( It worked well before that.
3,maybe not a good idea,"the device works good when you drive locally where you are familiar with. when you drive to large city or different places, you have to consistently change the frequency to avoid interferences. it's kind of frustrating, i would rather use other transmission device or just use earbug. gotta get a good earbud, since bad one irritate ears after long hours..."
5,Great product,I have had this product for almost a year and I dont have any complaints. I even bought one for someone else as a birthday present.
5,All the 4 and 5 star reviews on here are true!,"As most people, I was hesitant that a transmitter exists that cuts out virtually all the static. But this one really does! Although it's a little expensive, it's worth every penny if you're annoyed by static interrupting your ipod listening experience! The sound quality is pretty good. Not quite as perfect as my car stereo CD player, but about as good as it gets without having to buy a new car stereo or rewire my current one. If you don't want to have to mess with either of those things, this is a great alternative."
4,Great!,"They were easy to buy from and the product arrived not only on time but early!Thanks again,Mita"
3,"Good charger, OK sound quality, but difficult to tune in cities","Works well in the middle of nowhere, but forget it if you live in a city. Driving across country, I was able to listen for most of the way, but you do have to retune frequently, which can be dangerous. The sound quality is OK (not great). I am mostly just using it as a car charger for my iPod, with a cassette adapter for the sound."
1,A book with a very specific orientation,"This book is NOT suited for electrical engineers who want to learn SCADA. It is, however, adequate for business men or managers who would like to acquire a general (very general indeed)understanding of SCADA terminology. Themes within the book are treated superficially sometimes, with a greater depth in others (such as when addressing protocols) that is not consistent nor coherent. I do not recommend this book for a Power Systems Engineer, student of such systems, or any electric or electronic engineer that wishes to understand SCADA."
5,Excellent for training,"For training technicians, this book provides an excellent introduction to how SCADA systems work. Most of the more detailed system information requires training and manuals from specific vendors who usually provide good information on their products but little in the way of a system-wide view."
1,Total waste of time and money,"Info: I read the 3rd edition what was published in 2004.General: The book is easy to read and does not keep repeating itself. The chapters are ordered in a way that seems logical.Bookcontent:70% of the book has nothing to do with SCADA but is informing you on ways of communicating, which can be used for SCADA. This part was written in a time that a 1200 baud modem was state of the art equipment AND THAT WAS NOT 2004! The rest of the book gives you a global idea what the difference is between RTU's and MTU's and what they can do. Based on the fact that the communication part is completely outdated this will be as well. It did not give me any additional information on what I already new."
1,Outdated and Simplistic,I found this book to contain outdated technological references and was about the level of a high school course
3,"This is a good book, I think","After I read this book, I still want to know much more about SCADA. Exclusively in major electical engineering. May be the other reviewers have some information or publication about experiment using SCADA, so If you have the homepages info or email addressess info please contact me in rendry@mailcity.com"
1,"overprized, even for $30",Flimsy and squeaky despite being new. Cheap black plastic is glued on the inside. The outside design is pretty much like on the picture. It's made in China. For the quite steep retail prize of $100 you can get silver plated items at the least. But even for the sale prize of $30 it is overprized. You can get the same quality for under $10. Prize-value-ratio is just not acceptable.
1,One month later--still no item!,"I purchased this product exactly one month before I was supposed to give it as a birthday present. Here I am two days before the birthday, and I have yet to receive it.Even more concerning, the phone number for this company no longer works and the email section pops up an error message when I try to submit my complaint. To be fair, I did receive a return phone call from a customer sales rep about two weeks ago. However, I don't have anything to show for my purchase and as of now, no course of action to get a refund!"
3,Very interesting,"I found this book full of fascinating stories and philosophy.However, by the time I got to about 75% read, I found myself tiring of the stories.Maybe it was a little too long. In any event, it was a good read"
1,655 headset,I purchased this item for use with my blackberry pearl. Since I received the item I have been hearing complaints from people with whom I talk using the headset that there is TONS of static coming from me to them. I thought maybe it was just a break-in period but its been almost a month and nothing changed. I will attempt to return it now.
1,my worst ever and I've had a few,Range it's a huge problem with this device. My Dash is in my pouch attached to my belt most of the time but as soon as I increase the 2 feet range I'm in trouble. Sound quality doesn't even metter cause you never get to experience it unless your phone is within two feet. Batery? well another dissapointment. My last motorola headset lasted about a week compared to max two days with this one. However... very stylish! Don't buy it! Very disappointed!
5,Blackberry Headset HS-655,"I recently purchased this headset and am very pleased with it. It came with 3 sizes of urethane earpieces so I found one that fits snugly in my ear. The headset is so small and light I do not need to use the supplied wire loop. Sound is loud and clear thanks to the earpiece. The holster idea is great- it vibrates when a call is coming in and the earpiece automatically answers the phone as soon as I remove it from the holster. Someone complained about the reception- I experienced poor reception too, at first. I have a Blackberry Pearl and in the Options/Security Options/General Settings, I found a setting for Bluetooth Signal Strength. The default is the lowest setting. I had to enable password protection to change this setting, but once changed, I could disable the password protection again. Now, my headset operates clearly up to about 20 feet from my phone."
4,beats jawbone!,"Had 2 jawbones, both junk. Bought this & found it to be vastly superior, even though noise cancellation would be a nice addition, it's not necessary with this headset."
4,BlackBerry HS-655 Bluetooth headset,Reception is clear. Spoken words are easily understood. Light weight and comfortable. Some people may require the ear loop for the headset to sit comfortably in their ear. Nice touch with the capability to recharge the device with a AAA battery in the holster. Doesn't appear to be able to be paired with 2 cell phones (different manufacturer) at the same time.
3,slb review of blackberry 655,Overall pretty good product the charging cradle bites as you have to have it with you. I don't know why all the bluetooth's can't use a common charging tip.
3,BlackBerry HS-655 Bluetooth Headset,"Product worked well in most situations. But for a device supposedly designed for a BlackBerry, I wasn't impressed. Its audio seems to break up on some calls and makes it difficult for the person on the other end to follow you in a conversation. I have had several other Plantronic bluetooth products and bought this one thinking I would get the same if not improved BlackBerry phone performance. I didn't."
5,A Kerouac Must Have,"If you enjoy Jack Kerouac then you should have this book, it is a very good one. I enjoyed it very much."
1,Yeah...,"This reminds me of the things I write in notebooks when I'm hammered. I just don't get Jack Kerouac. If you're a fan, this may be for you. I took a course on him and bought a ton of his books expecting to love his style, but.. I don't get it. His point of view irritates me."
3,Jack Kerouac Book of Sketches,"This book arrived with the following on the cover: ADVANCED UNCORRECTED PROOF. NOT FOR SALE!There may be publisher's typos in this copy, and it seems that selling it is not legal. Therefore, I am skepticalabout the honesty of this seller. I do not remember seeing this included in the description when I chose to buythis particular book."
3,Cute but don't expect too much,"I bought this shirt for my son and a friend as gifts so they have not worn it, therefore I don't know how it will wash yet. The concept is quite funny and I think they'll like it but I definitely did not expect the design to be as small as it actually was on the shirt (4-5"" on a men's small can really get lost) and so you have to get up close to see what it is, which was a bit disappointing. Also, the quality of the screen printing was not good. It was pixilated, not crisp. I have not had this experience before even from far less expensive Chinese shirts so am a bit surprised. Seems more like the kind of shirt you might find at a fair in a cheap resort town at 2 for $7 or so. Not sure I would recommend this for the price."
1,Slick Package Does Not Make Up for Poor Video Quality,"If Vol. 2 is an improvement over Vol 1, I certainly don't want to waste my money on it. I can make better video transfers from old VHS tapes on my home computer equipment. Most of the source tapes for this collection are probably former rentals purchased in bulk from a video store. Considering that more than half of the movies appear to be ""edited for TV"" versions, they may even have been originally recorded off the air back when they played on late night TV.If you can't live without one or more of the movies on this DVD collection and can't find them elsewhere, then go for it. Otherwise, stay away from this one."
2,Films in Set Not Good,"This set does have better menus and packaging then Grindhouse Experience 1 and the prints and transfers are much better then the first set, but that being said, the films themselves are not nearly as good, I'm 3/4 through the set and I found most the films really boring and wouldn't consider any of them grindhouse or exploitation, everything Ive seen is sub par public domain foreign action films from the 60's and 70's, I can't even give much detail or description of the films because it's all so forgettable, I remember one of the movies had guys running around in tights and capes like superheros, I thought that was gonna be good, but it was not, I'd take a pass on this one. There is however another set released by this same company that is what this set should have been, good ""bad"" roadhouse action movies from the 60's and 70's and the prints are actually really good in that one, Thug City Chronicles (2009)http://www.amazon.com/Thug-City-Chronicles-Fred-Williamson/dp/B001DM37UE"
4,Riding my One Decision into a new job,"I picked up the One Decision when I was between jobs and looking to transition into a new field. A friend had recommended it to me and it just so happened that as I started reading the book, a long-shot job opportunity appeared on my horizon. Using a test-drive One Decision and closing my days by reading a chapter every evening, I put together a fantastic resume, cover letter, and interview. I got the job even though I had no specific experience in that field. That was two years ago, and while my job has had its ups and downs (as any job does) I have continued to refine my One Decision to engage fully in life and in my job. These are life-changing concepts and practices and I highly recommend this book."
1,No Help,"This is a frustrating book. The implication of the title and jacket blurb is that once you decide what to commit to, you can boil that commitment down to a single statement which then magically guides all your decisions for the rest of your life. The whole book is about what life is like after you make your One Decision, without explaining how people formulate their one decision. The 30 day program at the end of the book consists of living your life as if you had made your One Decision, which will then lead you to formulate your One Decision, which will then enable you to live as if you had made your One Decision. Instead of this book, pick up Robert Fritz's Path of Least Resistance for his description of fundamental, primary and secondary choices. He doesn't promise a single magic bullet, but he's a lot more direct about how to create a vision, make choices and get results."
1,Here's your one decision - PASS ON THIS BOOK!,"I bought this book based on the stellar reviews it had gotten. After reading it, wow, what a mistake. This is the worst book I have read on the subject - seriously. There's a lot of fluff and not much substance. Wayne Dyer and Carolyn Myss offer much more meaningful material - check them out instead."
1,Platitudes without Substance,"Rarely have I read a book filled with more platitudes -- live in the present, listen to your heart, follow your path, tell the truth, and so on and so on. If you are seeking your path, this book does not even point you in the right direction. Save your money or try reading ""The Power Of Intention""."
1,Too much repetition,The writer simply repeats the same message over and over in different ways. I became tired of the repetition after page 58 and quit reading the book.
2,Disappointed because it was not performed by the Ventures.,"Don't let the low price lure you into buying this album. Don't get me wrong, it was not a bad imitation of the Ventures. But, I was all set to listen to all those great songs performed by the real Ventures. So, if you are a die-hard Ventures fan, stay away from this one."
4,A liitle smaller than pictured but good quality.,"The pendant was a little smaller than showm in the picture (or maybe I just imagined it would be bigger) but both the pendant and chain were very good quality. I bought it for my 15 year old brother and her really liked it! This one actually comes with a nice chain, most others did not."
4,My two cents...,"Saitek Pro Flight Yoke with Three-Lever Throttle (PZ44)Saitek Pro Flight Rudder PedalsHappy with the product, NOT with the documentation. I haven't hit some of the compatibility glitches mentioned in other reviews, but have found the instructions for programming the controls dense and not real helpful. A glossary defining some of the jargon would be a welcome thing. Lots of trial and error have allowed me to begin to get a grip on the functions of the controls. I suspect my satisfaction will continue to increase as I experiment more. Both the Flight Yoke & the Rudder Pedals definitely need to be programmed to function correctly. I'm using MS Flight Sim X, flying the Grumman Goose, in Vista."
5,smooth,Works well and is very smooth. Only recommendation i suggest is getting a usb extension as the one connected to the product is entirely too short to go from the floor to the computer.
3,Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals,"Good construction, and work well.I would prefer that the centre 'indent' was less strong, it can make it difficult to make small adjustments because it requires you to add a little too much force, However I am still happy with the purchase, and do not understand the need to pay more for other pedals."
1,Saitek pedals,"Saitek... what can I say. I have used CHproducts pedals and yoke and the Saitek system surpasses CH all day ... any day.Highly recommended for ease of use, durability and performance.What really impressed me though,was the level of service offered by Amazon itself. This is because I live in Indonesia (Ozzie expat) and this product is simply not available here to my knowledge. Amazon prices and level of service are simply not available here either from local retailers.Highly recommended from me ... both the product and the retailer (Amazon)A big thank you for everythingTony Chilcott"
4,could use some more development,"All in all, these pedals are great. The biggest draw back I can see is that they slide on carpet. A flip down grabber for carpet and non-slip pads for floors would be great."
5,Perfect for light plane simulators,I bought these to practice maneuvers in conjunction with flight training. I use these with X-Plane 9. They respond remarkably similarly to the pedals in the 172 trainer I take lessons in. Well worth the money.
4,SAITEK PRO FLIGHT RUDDER PEDALS,"Rudder Pedals are Rudder Pedals only these are somewhat sturdier and comfortable. The base is somewhat slick and if used on carpet without the supplied velcro tape strips or some sort of holding mechanism/restraint, it will slide all over the place. Setup Instruction were very helpful especially if you are using SAITEK X-52 PRO Controller system. I found that everything worked fine if you DO NOT install SAITEK Software and use ONLY Microsoft Flight(FS9 for me)Sim Legacy Buttons/AXES Setup within the SETTINGS/CONTROLS/ASSIGNMENTS. Follow SAITEK Instructions for LEFT/RIGHT TOE BRAKES and then apply the same logic to assign the rest of your needed functions with BUTTONS or AXES checking as you go for no dual settings in the SAITEK JOYSTICK and SAITEK RUDDER Settings."
4,A must have add-on,"You must have this Add-on for you SIM.It works perfectly. besides it has a little glicht ont he left Tie, but nothing to worry."
5,Perfect addition to my Saitek X52 Joy stick and Throttle quadrent.,Like I was saying the work perfect with my Saitek X52 Joystick and Throttle pad. I wanted it because I own and play the SFX dulex edition and It's not as life like with out them!l would recommend it to any one looking for a more life like experience!
1,Don't even think of it,Bought for my soon who is very experienced with flight Sim. He hated it. Packed up and returned after 15 minutes.
2,Saitek Rudder Pedals,These rudder pedals are made very cheaply. They are plastic and narrow. They are also very very light. The feel of moving back and forth on them seem very awkward. The main disadvantage to these pedals is that they offer no teeth for carpet to put on the floor. You are forced then to have to make some kind of board or wall to use them effectively.Saitek designed a terrible product with these.
5,Good pedals for added realism in flight.,"Along with my purchase of the game controller these rudder pedals offer that last bit of realism to flight, expecially in the high speed jet sims like the F16 Falcon. Those last second really minor heading adjustments really do the trick when coming in hot ready to dispatch something or someone into the next dimension. They are a little light, at first moving around on the carpet. There are several very simple fixes for this which I had read about in other reviews and have applied. If you want realism, something I did, I'd go with the flight headset with surround sound for great situational awareness and killer microphone quality, the Hotas flight control system I reviewed prior and these rudder pedals."
4,They are good at sometime or sometimes nOt,Had these things for about 2 weeks befOre the left brake went broken ... So I retuned it and got another One .. The returning process was really easy ...
4,Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals,"Products works extremely well. Very easy to set up and use. Comfortable adjustable foot positions and tension control. Even works with legacy falcon4 flight sims. Product could be heavier with a bit lower tension adjustment controls to enable more stability on carpeted surfaces. There are screw holes in the foot rest however so use your imagination to address this minor issue. I would highly recommend to novice and veteran computer pilot jocks. The realism, control and ease of use is worth it, notwithstanding the great value for price!"
4,Can't Go Wrong,"I have to say that I spent a lot of hours searching for the Yoke, Pedals and other add-ons for my newly discovered rage, (Microsoft Flight Sim X with Accelerator pack). Looking back on it now, (It has been about a month or so), I can say that for those of you who are overwhelmed by all the choices and contradicting reviews like I was, GO FOR IT! These pedals are great and easy to install, (just plug them in). The tension is adjustable but I weigh about 210 and wound up turn the adjuster to full tension. That setting wore down a little but had no effect on the game or ease of use. I cut 2 pieces of 1 x 6 boards to a specific length that I then placed under my desk and butted up against the wall's molding. I then slid the pedals in place butting them up against the end of the boards. They stayed in place and even under those really stressful moments in the game when I should have gone left instead of right, they stayed put with absolutely no slip! They are worth the money!"
1,Saitex Pro Flight Rudder Pedals TechSupport,"After a month using my Saitex Pro Flight Rudder Pedals my system did not reconized it anymore. I tryed on other computers and the problem is the same. Amazon policy do not allow me to return afer 30 days, and Mad Catz, Inc. the company who gives support to this items, do not answer the phone and do not answer my emails.I am very desapointed for all the wasted time and the money I lost for a product that just worked for a few days. [ASIN:B000H67DDY Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals]]"
1,stuck in one position immediately out of box,"Took them out of the box just now and, with my hands, moved the pedals as they would normally move. They immediately got stuck in one position. The tension screw in the center will not move, it is also stuck. Plan on sending them back."
3,Same brake problem as other reviewers...,"By reading the other reviewers I have come to realize that my rudder pedals are not alone in having ""brake"" problems in air simulations!FSX shows brakes on until i tap them on my pedals. Happens in other sims as well. I was so happy just to have ANY rudder pedals I never noticed this serious issue as possibly native to the product generally.But whenever I read that a company doesn't support a product to be perfect...guess what?...I NEVER BUY ANOTHER OF THEIR PRODUCTS! I hope these companies are listening - though I doubt it!The one thing I am learning about flight-sim peripheral is the more the pay...the more headaches you may be buying and the LESS you may be actually getting for your money!!!"
5,Great Item,"These pedals are great. The resistance adjustment is the perfect way to simulate a realistic rudder control without making the sim unplayable for younger children or people who aren't used to flight simulators. With the knob design the transition between the amount of force is quick and painless. The pedals are also adjustable so that different sizes of feet can have maximum comfort. Lastly, the pedals are just top notch when it comes to calibration. There is no dead spot whatsoever and the self centering aspect is a great feature. I would buy another set if I was building another simulator."
3,Not for MS combat sim?,"I have tried to use this with my MS Combat sim 3 but I have not been able to get the programming of the toe breaks to work. The toe breaks seems to use the same signal as one aileron and one direction of the horizontal stabilizer. If I hit one of the toe breaks during flight I crash. It is very simple hardware and seems well built. Plug it right into a USB port and load the software and your ready to go. I have no idea why the program doesn't work with the combat flight sim 3. For me it was an expensive investment with little return, as I can not use it without causing the plane to go out of control. Had I known this before I would not have purchased this product. I am sure this would be great if the program works with your Flight Sim software!"
5,Works great right out of the box - no software needed.,"With ""Rise Of Flight"" these pedals worked great right out of the box. The flight sim recognized them as soon as we plugged them in and we didn't need to program anything. Which is nice, B'cuz we didn't need extra software running."
3,Great if you want to be real. Bad if you want fun,"Good:Well MadeGood AdjustmentLooks niceGreat for training or ""As Real as it Gets""Bad:You can have foot rests or wall spacers; not both. You are given two blocks;slip them on the front to keep them away from the wall so you have full range of motion, or put them on the back so you can rest your feet as you fly straight and level. Honestly these would cost about $.07 to make. Can't we have both?They are VERY, VERY, VERY HARD TO LEARN TO USE RIGHT! Moving your feet in sync and coordinating a turn is a lot more difficult than you think. I bought these here about four months ago with the Pro Flight Yoke System (Love That). I kept fooling with them off and on and never got it down. I sold them and am going to buy a Saitek Pro HOTAS.Conclusion: If you are training to be a pilot, or just want to keep it real, by all means these are great. If you just want to have fun just use Auto-Rudder or get a HOTAS."
1,CM Restrepo,Bad product. It has a unsurpasable installation conflict when you try to configurate toe brakes. I lost my money.
1,never again,THERE IS NO WAY TO CONFIGURATE THIS THING. I DIDNT ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT YET IT CAME .DIDNT RECIVE IT YET I JUST BEEN CHARGED180 DLS. ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS? OR IS IT JUST A WAIST OF TIME! HOPE THERE WAS A WAY TO TALK WITH SOMEBODY IN AMAZON
4,great product,It's a really great product and I don't have any trouble using it. The only thing is that they don't seem to explain the knob in the middle enough. But so far it hasn't effected any thing at all. I highly recommend this product.
2,Great product.... when it is working,software compatability is great but this product does not seem to have the ability to stand up to any sort of use. I was going through helicopter flight school at the time i bought these so i was fully aware of how to use pedals in helicopter applications. I found that if i went with more than 2/3 left pedal it would get stuck at the 2/3 level and then full left pedal application caused it to get stuck at full left. I pulled it apart to figure out what is going on and it appears that it is just a problem with the manufacturing. I kept the left base a bit more loose than the manufacturer did and it seems to help alleviate the problem but i do have a problem with it from time to time. My recommendation is dont buy this online unless you check the company to see if you can return a defective product free of charge.
5,Review,"Excellent for my FSX, calibration very easy and great response within the game. It's a great addition to add more realistic action to the game."
2,Saitek Pro flight Rudder Pedals,"The Saitek Pro flight Rudder Pedals are a great addition to my Flight Simulator X setup when they are working but the rudder pedals constantly get stuck in the full right position. I have to remove all the screws and take the rudders pedals apart to unstick the pedals. This is extremely frustating and time consuming. I would probably purchase my next set of rudder pedals from another company. They get stuck so often that I just stopped using them. They are just an expensive paper weight and foot rest for now, aleast until I take them apart again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've been a sim pilot since the days of ATF in the eighties, and in the real world all my life.The first pair jammed/locked up after 8-10 hours use. The second pair jammed/locked up after 5-6 hours use. The third pair jammed/locked up after only a single hour of use. I feel these pedals are not made of the right materials to make them a practical, viable product. My advice is, don't waste your money."
5,"Works Good, Lasts a Long Time","Bought these pedals over 3 years ago, they still work perfectly. They are aesthetically pleasing as well. Highly Recommended. I use them almost daily, so I can say they are very durable."
5,Saitek rudder pedals,"I use this as part of a ""home flight simulator"". It isn't the same as a ""flying"" simulator, but is good for practicing proceedures."
2,design wasn't,"I liked the designs in the book but the actual drawings were not very good. They were still very sketchy, I usually like something a little more refined in the drawings."
3,I was unimpressed,"Sorry dover, this was one I was sorry to have bought. Very similar patterns and not much of a challenge. I knew I was taking a chance but I had high hopes. It seems like kaleidoscope patterns are an iffy deal. I have great memories from childhood kaleidoscopes and I really wanted to try and recapture that joy and wonder, no such luck with these patterns. I hope I have better luck next time."
1,"waste of paper, in my opinion","The lines in this book are too thin, and rather spotty in some places. The pictures look like they were sketched with a pencil. If you are looking for something enjoyable to color, get the Mystical Mandala coloring book. I ordered this one and that one for two different people, and wish I'd have gotten them BOTH that other one."
3,nice detail but poor line quality,"I like these designs and the fact that they are quite detailed, but the line quality is quite poor.Not sure if it's poor printing, but some of the lines look almost smudged. I prefer a nice clean, sharp, distinct line."
3,crease,"The same thing happened with this one, like my other. It was folded in half in the mailbox and it had a crease in the middle."
2,Pixelated,"All of the patterns in this book do not have clear lines. It looks like they were all small images, enlarged to fit on pages that ended up pixelating all of the lines."
1,Bad.,"This coloring book is not good. The printed lines are blurry and smudged, and the spaces aren't complete. I don't like this book at all, I haven't even colored one because the outlines are so messy. Waste of money."
1,Review,"I should have paid more attention to the description. The design's do not have hard lines, more like pencil drawing, not what I expected for coloring. I will keep it, but it will not be the first book I pick up when I want to color, sorry to say."
2,Kaleidoscopic Design Coloring Book,The quality of paper and repoduction was poor - and back to back pages bleed onto the graphics not colored.
2,poor quality,The printing is of very poor quality and I was very disappointed. I think the lines should have been more defined.
3,Beautiful,Wonderful designs and literally hours of creative fun.These are really beautiful patterns and a joy to color.I will be buying more for the colorers in my life! One thing I do not like is if you color with a marker the picture on the other side of paper is lost because the colors bleed through.
2,For the completist,"This album is not up to the standards of ""The Roaring Silence,"" ""Messin,"", ""Nightingales & Bombers,"" and the self-titled album, all of which I rate 4-5 stars. The sound quality is muddy, too."
3,Palm Router,"Great size, with plenty of apparent power. The on/off switch is a little cumbersome in its position, and there is no soft start feature, so make sure you've got hold of this little monster at start-up. My biggest complaint is that in a sustained routing condition the aluminum body gets very hot and uncomfortable to hold onto. If Bosch could/would add some insulating grip pads to the housing this would be an excellent tool. If I was in the market for this type/size router again, I would not buy this one."
5,Bosch Colt Palm-Grip Router,TheBosch PR20EVSK Colt Palm Grip 5.7 Amp 1-Horsepower Fixed Base Variable Speed Router with Edge Guideis a router that easily handles most jobs that I do with ease.
2,Close but...,"I bought this router when the nice old Porter Cable 310 became hard to find. It looks like a good design, simple and rugged, but the tool I purchased refurbished from Bosch CPO had a critical flaw. The spindle was not square to the base and as a result round-over bits would cut differently depending on which side of the router you hold against the work piece. I asked Bosch to send me another but they would not and told me to have it serviced locally. I explained the problem to the local authorized repair facility and he did his best to correct it, but even after replacing several parts, he could not correct the problem.Bosch may have since figured this problem out, but if you buy this tool, check the spindle squareness (with the base in the lock position)first thing. If it is not perfect, RETURN IT and try again with a different one. Good luck."
4,Charming and memorable,"I've actually watched, laughed at and been surprised by this movie twice! (The second time I wanted to share it with my grown daughter.) As someone approaching 60, tattoos and piercings have been a big mystery to me. The fascination becomes clear in this unexpected love story. The film has a very personal feeling. You want to be friends with the characters - spend some time with them. And rather than a Hollywood ending, this movie has the right ending. I'm recommending ""Tattoo"" to all my friends who are interested in film."
5,Excellent romantic comedy/drama,"Tattoo is an excellent indie film, a love story about two unlikely lovers; a tattoo artist and an uptight schoolteacher. Don't think it's going to go down the predictable road, either. Although I tend to avoid anything with connotations of romance, this was an engaging and entertaining movie; I've watched it several times and bought copies for friends and relatives.If you want to see a good movie, and don't like the mainstream romances, get this - it's good. Everyone I gave it to or watched it with liked it."
4,Empty Gold Box,"This was the Gold Box special...went to 100% at 3 minutes after it went on sale. Did Amazon have ONE available?Theres more at the regular price, what gives?"
2,So what's New?,"While the advise regarding resume writing per se was sound, it was also common knowledge for the most part. Most disappointing was the lack of any unique information or focus regarding resume writing for those in 'science' careers, the presence of which is strongly suggested in the title of the text thus setting apart from the plethora of texts on the subject. Personally, I did not find any information in the whole of the text that I couldn't readily find either online or in any number of resume writing texts."
5,Air America - CIA's Secret Airline,"Monty Markham, who made this film, got it right because his brother was an Air America pilot and knew the inside story. The CIA just honored Air America, at the University of Texas at Dallas, for their service in Laos and Vietnam. This film presents the facts. The truth is long overdue. Judy Porterhttp://www.amazon.com/Air-America-CIAs-Seret-Airline/product-reviews/B0016OKQSK/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;="
5,CIA: Air America Doc,Very well put together. Enjoyed the complete showing. I flew with some of these players and it good that there is a unclassified record of their Heroic deeds.
1,Based on dubious private revelations,"The claim of Jesus trip to the Far East has been repudiated by all scholars who researched the subject. The spurious claims of Soviet journalist N. Notowitch have been checked and proofed false by Max Müller from Oxford University who at the beginning was sympathetic to the idea. There is no historical or archeological data supporting the claim, only revelations from demonic spirits pretenting to be Jesus or Mary, on which this book is based."
4,"He""s Back","Ive been a fan since the begining,I never really got over the Rob,Chris split,system x was ok the vocals did me in.So here we come to this project,""well"" done He has found a vocalist that can play the part,the music could be the best yet,the songs are well constructed,catchy,they stick with ya,and best yet even though they have plenty of melody they are heavy,you can sing along or bang your head.I have seen some flack on his song called punk,I think its great, its better than most of the stuff that you here on the radio,and besides that its about time sombody makes a statement like that.This song could be a hit if record companies would take a chance,this whole album could top the charts,Anyway it deserves a rating of 5 but,I wonderd about some language and the love song,but most people wont even notice."
5,Best Impellitteri Yet!,"Awsome! I've been a fan of Chris Impellitteri his whole career and I can honestly say this is his best album by far, which is surprising considering it comes 20 years into his career. The production is magnificent, and the songs grab you and don't let go. Thanks Chris for an incredible album."
1,Cheesy rip-off metal,Thos whole CD is a giant rip-off of other groups. Listen to 'The Fall of Titus' on this album and then listen to In Flames 'Pinball Map'. A bit too similar for me. I prefer original material. This stuff is just too cheesy.
1,Cat Hates it,"I had found some of this brand food locally and the cat loved it. Then i could not find it locally again so I went on line. I have no idea if it is a different ""flavor"" or if it is stale or just plain no good but our cat who is never a picky eater will not touch this. It was a total waste."
2,spoons unsatisfactor.,Returned spoons as bowl too flat to hold much soup. Vendor completely OK on refund process.
4,Good Fun; Good History,"This book is good fun for anyone who has the slightest interest in Ancient Rome. The focus is on Julius Caesar and Pompey as seen through the eyes of a middle aged Roman of the Plebian class.The politics are interesting as is the personal story of Gordianus the Finder. He is a kind of private detective but they don't have that term at that time.All the books in this series are good and you don't have to have a lifetime commitment to Roman history. Anyone can pick it up, enjoy it, and perhap learn a bit about the past. But this is not a didactic tome in any way. It is a good story and that is always fun."
3,There have been better.,"I found this book very disappointing, compared to the rest of his series. It is too lacking in detail and short to be really interesting as a novel, and the mystery was too predictable. In timepiece fiction, such as this, I find myself looking for the historical details. ('Roman Blood', 'Catilina's Riddle', 'The Venus Throw' and 'A Murder on the Appian Way' all offer a very clever thesis on famous Roman scandals, and involve many subplots.) 'Rubicon' is very straight and narrow, almost like reading a timeline with dialogue. Also Caesar's lovey dovey relationship with Meto is a little far reaching, homosexuality aside, Caesar publicly aimed high."
1,A Suspense Novel Without The Suspense,"This book was a colossal disappointment. In Rubicon, Saylor does not use any of the lush characterization or attention to historical detail that he used in his previous novels in the Gordianus the Finder series.Even worse, was the fact that this is a mystery novel without a real mystery. The reader is able to figure out whodunit very early on in the book. However, the detective Gordianus the Finder does not reveal the solution until after going through a series of contrived incidents that violate the readers's suspension of disbelief. The only reason why the solution was not revealed early on is that this would have made Rubicon no more than a novelette. In other words, Rubicon is a novelette with about 200+ pages of padding.I give this novel a 1 out of 5 rating."
4,Rich historical detail wrapped around a great mystery,"This is the first of Steven Saylor's books that I have read and I found it to be very enjoyable. I am a big fan of ancient history and his novel brings to life many rich details that get overlooked in the history books.At times the language seems slightly stiff and implausible, but this does not detract from the story and seems to enhance the fact that the characters are thinking and speaking thousands of years ago in a language that has different syntax and structure from English(the book is in English).A great read for any fan of mystery and history. Can't wait to read some of his earlier works."
4,Great read,"Like all Steven Saylor's Sub Rosa series, this book is a fascinating read. It's a great window into Roman times."
3,"Not his best, yet better than others","This is certainly not the best work in the Gordanius serie. Yet it has all the historical precision that is absent in the writings of authors like Lindsey Davis. In those books you feel like you're reading about a 21st century mind which accidently ended up in the body of an ancient hero. Not with Saylor, who always succeeds in convincing you that the novel characters are true Romans (even though that can't be true). So even not at his best, Steven Saylor is superior to every ancient suspense writer"
4,"A well written, knowledgeable and interesting book.","I wasn't sure about what this author's book would be like. I had heard so much..... she was too commercialized, etc.... But I decided to judge for myself. I am happy to say that I found her book to be very responsibilly written. Her views are consistant with what the Craft is really all about. I have read quite a few books on this subject.... this one is one of the best.... I wouldn't hesitate to read another of her books!"
4,Bewitching....,"Love Magic is written by one of the USA's most famous (or infamous) Witches, Laurie Cabot. The first half of this book explains what Love Magic is, how magic works, ritualism, astrological correspondences and such. The second half of the book is basically a grimoire (or collection of practical spells) to attract, enhance or dispel love and relationships. Contains two dated Appendices. Overall, fun for getting in touch with witch inside. Recommended for newbies to the craft and hardcare Cabot fans."
3,O.K.,This book was just O.K. and some of it was obviously written for the Wicca teeny-bopper fluffy-bunny mentality. For a better read I would have to recommend Gerina Dunwich's WICCA LOVE SPELLS (a.k.a. THE SECRETS OF LOVE MAGICK) or Marina Medici's LOVE MAGIC.
2,CHEESY,"Laurie Cabot's books are overrated in my opinion. I was especially not impressed with her LOVE MAGIC, which seemed to be nothing but a cheesy promotional gimmick to sell her overpriced products. For a much better book on the art of love magic I highly recommend Gerina Dunwich's WICCA LOVE SPELLS."
2,Was too modern older tends to be more accurate,"i thought it was minamal information nothing compared to older books such as ""Wicca"" and others information was un educated and adolesent probobly written by a young woman who thinks she has powers she really doesnt take it from me people the older the book the better"
5,"more kimba, but please give us the other half....","I absolutely love Kimba and this boxed set is great, exactly as it was in my (australian) childhood...my only complaint is that we don't get every episode of Kimba...please release the other half of this boxed set...Being Australian, I had to buy (another) DVD player, one that was multi-zoned...but when I heard and saw my first love, after all these years...aaawwwwww....."
3,No restoration!,"Although the series itself was an impressive effort and the folks at Right Stuf International have a great catalog, it seems that no effort was made to present Kimba in its best possible light. Tons of scratches, uneven luminance and color shifts. I work in post production and these things can be fixed! I'm not saying you should not buy it, the series is definitely five star but the DVD quality brings it to a three. Too bad."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Okay, first with the positive: The video footage is semi-professional and the editing is quite professional. The planes are beautiful (no complaints about that). Now with the negative: WAY TOO SHORT!!! Not a good value as it is over too quickly. I've taken more footage at a regular RC fly in when there are only a fraction of the planes. Way too much time spent on each plane interviewing the pilots/builders. The sound editing was horrible. The rotten music (imagine the old documentary music from years past where the music really doesn't fit the picture - imagine this analogy: a Sousa march for the Men in Black movie, they are both good but not together) and that is what you get. The ""music"" absolutely OVERWHELMED the footage as opposed to it being background music. This DVD had such potential but it really misses the mark. Don't pay more than $5 total for this, it isn't worth it."
1,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this item through a local retailer. The vinyl/rubber seal was far too tight for the aluminum channel, despite application of soap, petroleum jelly, hot water, and (finally) pliers. Customer support was non-existent, but they get ONE LOUSY STAR for being made in the USA. Except for the installation screws which were made in China and (I swear to God) which broke off at the head in the door sill. Frost King may have other quality products, but this is not one of them."
1,poorly designed product,"I should have heeded this products first review, its rubber seal is to large for the metal channel, you cannot fully track it. My recommendation, find another way to seal your doors."
3,Very Tight,"When first installed it is very tight making the door hard to open and close, but after a few weeks it becames looser though there remains a very good tight seal."
5,Nazareth versus AC/DC,"I do agree this album is great, its always good to have an album that also misses a few hits but then has others that normally you would not find.This album is worth it in every way. The sound is great the mixing amazing and man memories....listen to telgrapg and then the bridge is so Queen like it (Brian May type guitaring from Brighton Rock) and man these guys were good, but sadly stuck to the pub scene instead of being a live band, but then I must say I would NEVER buy the live Nazareth CD or DVD' s but all their stuff is well worth ever effort to get. Especially No Mean City...At least this CD is not for the ""new"" Nazareth fan this is for the conoiseur, taken heavily with extra speakers and pounding air guitars and drums to match, enjoy....I do agree they match AC?DC but NOT LIve....here they can learn..."
3,works like it should BUT.........,"They work as they should , but the water jug scares my dog and she will not drink from it. As the bubble is created, it is loud. The food container is purfect."
2,Not my favorite,"This brand of diet cookie is good. Lemon is my favorite flavor in general so I thought I'd like these the best...but they are my LEAST favorite.Strange consistency, the crumble easily, and not a very good flavor."
3,Not great,I have been doing the cookie diet as part of a diet/exercise plan for around two months. I have lost weight. After eating the Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal cookies non-stop I was looking for a break and tried these. They're not terrible... but no where near as good as the Oatmeal Raisin and Chocolate chip. On the plus side they are still WAYYY better then the cranberry orange ones.
4,Not bad,"I actually thought these we fine. They were actually better than I thought they would be. I've had chocolate chip so this was equally good to me. I put mine in the microwave for 10 seconds and usually drink some milk (even though that's very cliche). It fills me up and does not cost an arm, a leg, and two toes like Dr Siegal's Cookie Diet. You can easily pay over $50 for ONLY a week supply. Although I loved Dr Siegal, this is a cheaper alternative if you don't have the extra money to spend."
1,Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love lemon everything, but this is gross. They don't work and it tastes like saw dust."
5,I hated to see this one end!,"Anyone who works in the area of organizational design or development should read this book. Art puts the history into context and let's us know the people who shaped the ideas. I loved learning about Kurt Lewin, Ron Lippet, Tom Peters...and so many others. The stories Art tells help me understand the events that shaped their lives and their thinking.I was truly sorry when I arrived at the last chapter. I wanted to hear more."
3,Not as good as prequel #1,"I did find the book interesting and I'm addicted to the series (hey, there are worse things to be addicted to!), so it is worth the read.This book was made better through the people we meet. We meet Abdullah, get to know his wife a bit, and Rayford and Irene both get fleshed out as adults. I found them much more interesting as adults. The authors need to refrain from writing dialogue for children like in the last book because I don't feel it ""works."" I also enjoyed seeing Hattie. I always loved her character. And finally we meet Fortunato and find out how he and Nicolae begin working together!I enjoyed getting to know both Irene and Jackie better. In the main series they are rapured at the beginning so we don't really get to know them as people.A good book although not quite as good as the first. I gave the first 4 stars, so I'll give this 3."
1,What a bunch of crap.,The author has the wrong interpretation of the Bible. No one should buy these books. The whole series is just wrong.
3,not the best of the prequels,"The first prequel of the Left Behind series was very interesting. This one wasn't so much. There wasn't much excitement in it. It was interesting to see how some of the characters got where they are in the Left Behind book, but some of it was a little boring. I'm not really looking forward to reading the 3rd prequel because I'm guessing it will be more of the same as this one."
2,Typical Summer Read,"Regime is better than The Rising. This book reminded me of the earlier Left Behind books. It doesn't take much brain power to handle this one. You can quickly read through it and still get the story. However I'm still trying to figure out WHY these two guys decided to write MORE Left Behind books. I'm placing my money on the point that they want MORE money.You get to see more of the behind-the-scenes work with Carpathia and this ""regime"".Here are a couple observations: I understand that homosexuality is in the news alot but when you have to use a sentence to remark about it as jokes I quickly get discusted. The lines did not have to be in the story. Secondly, Leon is in this story...I hope in the next prequel(oh why am I anticipating it?!?!?) Jenkins explains why we don't hear anything about him until, what, three books into the series?**sigh** if you have to read this book, get it from the library. Then forget about it as soon as your finished."
1,A book best described . . .,. . . by what it is not.It is not historical.It is not biblical.It is not theological.It is not authentic Christianity.It is not well-written.It is not worth your time.It is not worth your money.
4,Love this book!,"I really enjoyed the story, the writing is, for the most part, excellent. It can get really scary in some parts and definitely incorporates some of the characters in LB. I did find the story of the steele family less than fascinating at times but the rest of the stories, especially the choosing of Nicolae was both scary and fascinating."
3,The Regime,A very good read. I had forgotten I had read this book a few years back but it was good to read it again.
3,Exposition,"This entire series is exposition for the Left Behind series. Don't open it expecting the action of the original series. Don't turn to the Left Behind series for sound biblical doctrine either, so all people claiming the validity or lack thereof needs to understand this is a work of fiction and is two individual's interpretation of biblical prophecy. While it may not be accurate it is interesting. If you want accuracy pray and open your bible. Don't supplant biblical study with works of fiction. Simply open the book and enjoy."
5,The Regime: Evil Advances,"The Regime: Evil Advances (Before They Were Left Behind, Book 2. I received this item and was pleased. I would use this vendor again."
1,Not a good book,"I had heard about the Left Behind series, and this is the first book of it that I've read. The overall writing is too transparant to be a suspenseful and interesting book for me. By reading this book I was not encouraged to question the security of my soul, nor did not find the book interesting or enjoyable."
3,Better than The Rising...,"While this second installment of the prequel trilogy was better than the first, I'm still not sure that having prequels was a good idea. The thing that rubbed me the wrong way about this book was Nicolae Carpathia's character--I can only hope that the third prequel ties everything together, because in the first Left Behind book, he does seem to be a decent person. The reader understands that he is probably the antiChrist; however, he does not seem anywhere near as self-centered and evil as he does in The Regime. I'm anxiously awaiting The Rapture in hopes that it will finally tie the prequels to the original series and make me feel that reading the prequels was not a waste of my time."
5,If only they could talk!,"What a great book!When I first heard about it I thought that the author may have padded the numbers by making up a lot of bogus pet peeves. The fact of the matter is that every one of these peeves is legitimate, and in some cases eye-opening.And although much of the book is written in a light and humorous tone, there are also some items in it, (giving them cheap food, neglecting vet visits, dental health, etc.) that are quite serious.If you've had pets all your life and you're looking for an insight into their little minds, then you really should not only get this book, but refer to it often.If you're thinking about getting your first dog or cat, then you should get this book first, and avoid all the little mistakes first before turning your pet into a neurotic basket case."
5,History of the Samurai,"Richard Storry makes his way thru the myth and presents the realities of samurai life. This lifestyle though complex, was able to maintain a powerful and refined culture. Of course the book is also greatly enhanced by the fantastics photos of Werner Forman.The book takes us on a trip through an alien world. Out of it emerges an austere life drawn from Zen and Confucain ethics, which lead to the devlopment of Bushido."
3,You could not find a better book,"This book has got to be one of the finest introductory paleontonlogy books on the market. I actually took Paleontology class from Don Prothero and found that this book was an excellent guide and very well written. At times I could hear his vocie reading the chapters to me. Thre are considerable references to outside sources and Don does an excellent job of removing many of the rote memorization that introductory books of this type often have. Some sections appear to be dwelled on for much longer than seems necessary, but about a week later you find yourself realizing that those subjects really are deserving of the in depth coverage they recieve. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."
1,Written quite disappointed,The comments have been made with some non objective view. Defects of a person can not prevail on the artist himself
2,Herbert Complains,"This book is mostly a list of complaints that Breslin had in reference to working for Pavarotti. He didn't complain about the money he made though in exploiting this mans talent. Pavarotti was human like the rest of us and of course had his faults. Others have described him as warm, loving and generous. This may be illustrated by the chapter that Pavarotti wrote at the end of this book. He was most generous to Breslin in his comments and never mentioned anything unflattering about his former manager. Maybe this illustrates the attitudes of the two men better than anything Breslin mentions in the book. Finally, Pavarotti will be defined most by his incomparable voice and great talent. He was truly the greatest tenor. Vinceroooooooo! Vinceroooooooooo! Mr. Pavarotti, you won!! You won!!!"
2,luciano deserved better,"I read this before his death, and even then it seemed like a low blow. The author is so busy touting his own importance and taking credit for everything, that he consciously and unconsciously makes Pavarotti the fool(not that he wasn't in some ways). A more accurate title would have been, ME and the king."
4,Insightful and informative,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the external influences that shape the course of a correctional institution, and given its emphasis on remediation, Patuxent shines as a becon of hope in the face of a punitive atmosphere even if its ideal types of therapy are not fully realized. Well organized and easy to read, this book is a must read for those wishing to understand the complex processes that influence organizations such as correctional facilities."
3,Kind of Small,"It's a pretty small bed, but my cat isn't all that big. I bought this based on the other customer's review, but I am not as impressed. She doesn't like it very much."
2,If you live in a....,"If you live in a 5 million dollar house, this is the book for you. If you have a 3000 sq foot cape cod, forget it. I purchased this book to learn how to light MY house. I don't have a 60 foot indoor pool, or a mountain top view of downtown LA. This book was of no use to me at all. I give it 2 stars because it has nice photos, of houses most of us will never see in person."
1,poor quality control,"These cases are O.K. but fragile. If you drop one, it's trashed. My main complaint is that only 40% of them are useable. I bought mine at BestBuy. When I got them home, I opened the package and found most of the cases were missing the little plastic hinge.Tried to return them, but BestBuy accused me of breaking them. I went into the store and inspected the other packages. Those too had most of the hinges missing. Go ahead, buy 'em if you want to. You'll just end up throwing most of them away."
4,Save space. Get these.,"I have so many recordable CDs and DVDs that I can't buy these fast enough. Some people say my place looks like a recording studio. My arsenal of home videos has grown exponentially over the years, and a few years ago I transfered 93 camcorder tapes to DVD, with each tape being 1 1/2 hours in length. Now it's time to upload them to YouTube! If you have hundreds of recordable DVDs like I do, then these slim jewel cases will come in handy, not to mention they'll save a lot of space. They come in five different colors -- red, orange, purple, green, and blue.Don't expect these cases to be really durable, because they're not. They crack easily if you're not careful with them. Sometimes they come unhinged.Overall, a good product that I recommend for your storage needs."
4,"Great bargain, but quantity over quality","These are cool little slim cases. Love the bright colors and the fact that you get 50 of them for around $10 bucks. However, be careful storing them as the plastic cover easily pops off/breaks. I usually end up with about 10 broken ones and 40 good ones. I don't really care since I just use them occasionally when I give a CD/DVD to a friend.Great for protecting CDs and DVDs, but sometimes it seems like they themselves need a bit of protecting."
3,Not bad but I have purchased better...,I got these for a great price so I am not complaining.Memorex makes or sells different quality JC.I give away a lot of CD/DVD's so these suit my purpose.Side note..I recently had a couple of issues with my account.Amazon took care of the problem...immediately ..to my satisfaction. I am a very happy/pleased Amazon customer.Thanks to everyone at Amazon and JB. :)
4,love the smell,"I love a good man smell (coming from the wife of the man using it) and this is a nice and refreshing smell - not too musky, but definitely a good man smell to it! I was leary at first, but just went with it - and I'll probably order more soon."
2,Not so hot,"The worst of my three Anolon pans. Non-stick not as goo, drain spout in corner by handle, should have an assist handle for draining. Great grip, though!"
1,DO NOT get this toy until HasBLO gets it right!,"Everything about this toy is great, if you leave it in the package and do not discover that the decal sheet is from Anakin's YELLOW Sneak Preview Starfighter! I have contacted HasBLO about this, only to get a form letter stating that ""what I ordered is currently unavailable"". I am NOT going to put incorrect decals on this toy, so HasBLO better get it right! They are now obviously aware of the error, so the ball is in their court. Until this toy gets the correct decals, it will NOT be displayed in my collection. I am NOT going to put yellow decals on the ship, nor am I going to have an R4-G9/R2-D2 hybrid because of their mistake! A company like them should know better, and have better quality control. They replaced the missing Boba Fett rockets for the OTC Target Slave I, so I hope they come through on this. Ridiculous!"
3,death in a sunny place,a murdered body dragged out of the lake---why is everyone acting so strange? odd things going on in people's behavior. a luxury liner becomes the intrique for deaths' starting point.
5,aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwssssssssoooooooommmmmmmm!!!,I have had this gun fore 3 years it has been working better evry day it needs .20gram BB's.
1,This gun sucks,"I bought this exact gun at Gart Sports a couple weeks ago. The first time I used it in a airsoft battle in just stopped working It is not jammed, and the batteries are not dead (I put in new ones just to make sure)."
1,sucks,It Broke the 2nd week i got it not a very good christmas idea try a 450 feet per second gun that is the right choice!
3,Variable Rate Rear Springs,"I installed these along with new struts. I love the variable rate springs on the front, but on the back they are too firm."
2,An E for Effort,"Maybe it's me. I got halfway through this book and haven't picked it up again. Once upon a time I could never do that, no matter how bad the book, but this is my first (and I still feel the guilt).The characters fell in love at first sight, but it's the complacent love, the kind of love that you fall into AFTER the happily-ever-after. There was no sexual tension, no fighting their feelings or each other, no zip, no zazz, no bang. In other words, I was completely bored. Every page I turned was an effort.And Cody's country accent drove me nuts!!! I just kept picturing a backwoods good ole' boy with no backbone and a goofy hick saying for every occassion.I am so unbelievably sorry, Ms. Craig, but I just couldn't find the silver lining in this book."
5,Perfect Halloween Treat,We receive over 3000 trick or treaters at our house and the chocolate was a hit. We did a Great Gatsby theme and the children loved the gold coins. Flavor Finders made sure to call us to tell us when the product was shipping to ensure that the temperature was perfect. Great experience!
5,Excellent pocketknife,"I have several pocket knives like BUCK, HERBERTZ, GERBER, SMITH&WESSON, VICTORINOX and other German made blades but this Leatherman K503x is the best knife I've ever owned. Not only it being a multi fucntion pocket knife but the kind of blade they used is excellent. It can withstand rugged use without the worry of denting the blade. Although, it's kinda pricy, but for me it's worth every penny I've paid for. I've never expected that Leatherman would be able to come up with someting like this."
3,"I love disco: energy, vol 2","these cd's are ok, but only 15 songs/mixes are good. I don't understand why ""my forbidden lover"" is on this compilation, this song is ""slow"". there are a high energy version, why is not on this CD? the Alaska's song it doesn't seem a remix, the radio version is better. ""relight my fire"" by cafe society, is not as good as ""somebody to love"", other song of this group. this song is on volume one of this collection. I prefer the vol 1, is better."
4,An Amazing Story of Survival in Uncertain Times,"Having actually met the author, I'm completely amazed by this true story. I can't imagine having to live through the experiences in which she faced with courage and hope,as well as fear. I believe everyone should read this great story of an unbelievable survival through the horrific times of the holocaust of someone who kept going and continued on to build an amazing life and create such a wonderful family. This is truly the story of the American dream and having it come true."
2,Not the Kimba we Rememba,"I gave this as a gift, and asked my friend to watch it with me, ""to be sure it plays."" Please check out the comments on the box set before you buy. I was so disappointed in the quality of the DVD transfer. Mostly it seemed dated and slow to me as an adult. I would not have bought it (at a local store) if I'd read these reviews beforehand."
4,Entertaining,"Entertaining read with a captivating storyline. The author does an excellent job of portraying the compassion that the main character, Yuma Pike (loner/outcast) has for the individuals he suddenly is saddled with the responsibility of leading them to safety."
4,service is 1st,"Maybe you people should buy from a retail store that provides a labor warranty, assembly, and service. You should also read on the Bowflex and Nautilus website, they are the only authorized site to buy online and can deny warranty if purchased online elsewhere."
1,Treadclimber TC5000,"This treadclimber has not worked for me 50% of the time in the last year. I call customer service and you spend two to three hours taking the machine apart and unplugging wiring harnesses. Then it will work and the next time you want to use it the tread will not move and the machine says error. The technical support people will tell you this is uncommon and it must be something I did, but eventually you realize they are liars and their product is a piece of junk. Then they will send you some new parts, I didn't pay over 2,000 dollar to waist my time fixing this machine. I would love to send it back, but I am stuck with a 2,000 dollar piece of junk. I work in a hospital and will tell everyone what a waist of money this product is."
1,Do not waste your time or money!!!!!,"If I could give it zero stars I would. I recieved a lemon.... the machine does not work. Customer service has been giving me the run around. They are rude and unprofessional I would expect more from a company with the reputation that bowflex has. That being said I am still waiting for someone to come and ""evaluate"" the machine. If I return it I am responsible for the shipping because the no hassle return witthin 6 weeks only covers returns based on a working machine. Since my machine never worked the 6 week window does not begin until I have a working machine. Go figure. Just say no to bowflex."
1,Was thinking about buying,I was thinking about buying a 5000 but after reading all the negitive reviews i will pass on this one.
2,More history than humor,"As an uninformed infant, I knew very little about the Watergate affair besides general details until I read this book. Thus, if knowing who Bebe Rebozzo strikes you as important and you don't have the patience to wade through a Nixon biography, this book is for you. The essays are obviously collected from news-paper columns, since they often feature the same litany of facts about Watergate over and over, meaning that the humore quickly wears off. The book does feature some truly witty columns however, such as an imagined conversation between Brezhnev and Kissinger."
5,Excellent!,This book is fantastic reference for anyone interested in doing research on hate crimes. Levin and McDevitt know what they're talking about!
5,FANTASTIC!,I read this book as a child and was enthralled by it. I still enjoy reading it today as an adult. I highly recommend it for any child! Enid Blyton has a gift for wrapping you up in world of the Faraway Tree and all it's adventures!
4,Great Caramel hull-less popcorn,Very good snack to take to work with your lunch or pack in your child's lunch box. Fair price for item.
1,no caramel ..just sickingly sweet suger,"Oh my ,,,Here I thought this was healthy and good,,,No way,,,This is straight sugar ..no other flavor,,,Also high calorie count. Sickingly sweet...Nothing gourmet about this bag of sugar.Pass on it........Don't buy"
3,Good read -- not great,"I did not care for all the angst among the characters; and I do get annoyed when the main character continues to butt in all the time, but hey, i am not a writer"
3,Expectations Unresolved,"I looked forward to reading the second Emma Fielding GRAVE CONSEQUENCES by Dana Cameron once I dried it out. My copy was doused with six inches of rain, maybe I should have left some of the pages damp because the reading was dry and as uneven as the ripples of the paper.A great premise, missing student, lost saint, and a medieval cemetery, but it didn't hold through the narrative.Hope the next one is better.Nash Black, author of HAINTS."
1,Deserves a quick burial,"I was able to dig only halfway through this book before giving up on it. None of the characters are in the least interesting, attractive or believable. Most are one dimensional. While the story is ostensibly set in the (imaginary?) English town of Marchester, there is virtually none of the local color one looks for to give one a sense of time and place. The fact that the author and her protagonist are both archaeologists promised an interesting slant on the plot, a promise not kept."
2,Disappointing,"I adore Lucas and have read each ""Prey"" novel and enjoyed all of them. Sadly, the best word I can use to describe this one is BORING! Who cares about aging Russian spys? And too many characters with hard to remember foreign names. Please John, take us back to nasty serial killers and psychological mysteries!"
3,Plot Stretch,"Sandford's a pro, but this time the plot is not up to the usual level. Too much commuting makes for car sickness. His Kidd was a good entry, Let's hope Lucas comes back stronger."
2,Visit Your Library,"Having read all of the author's Lucas Davenport novels, perhaps I'm just ""Prey""ed out. While I'm sure I'll pick up the next one too, it'll be at the library if this weak addition is any indication of where the series is headed. Save your money and visit your own library for this one."
3,I miss the old Lucas!!!!!,"The ""new"" Lucas, i.e., married with kid and guardian for another is so tame. Bring back the old Lucas with gratuitous sex and violence."
2,Bland Prey,"I have read many of the ""Prey"" novels and this one was not the finest. This particular novel lacked the thrill, suspense and the ""badness"" which have made the ""Prey"" novels of particular interest to me. The story line was cumbersome with countless trips between northern Minnesota towns. The character of the enigmatic Russian agent was underdeveloped. Lucas is still sharp and does not miss a detail, but he has lost his coolness and bad boy personna. While reading, it seem like both the protagonists and text were going simply going through the motions."
3,Good Entry in the Series,"As John Sandford goes, this one is actually a pretty good, there are some believable characters, the plot is fine, and the action is going.Do not get me wrong, Sandford is his usual moronic self: bad guys are on rampage; the body count is going up by an hour; the police, the FBI, the Russian SVR, and Lukas himself all are watching helplessly; on top of all of this we learn that there is a ""conservative"" governor in Minnesota, but it is clearly one of the best in the ""prey"" series."
1,What a shame - the worst of the Prey series,"This is my first Amazon review and unfortunately it's to say that this book is not worth reading, not less buying. It's unfortunate because until this book, John Sandford had given us 14 (I believe) other FANTASTIC Prey novels. It was a joy to buy the latest Prey novel and see Davenport work his magic. In this newest one, however, not only does it lack the edge of the earlier ones, it also makes Davenport a mediocre detective. Nowhere does Lucas Davenport shine in this book. Any bad guys that are caught in this book - none of them were caught DUE TO Davenport. It was purely coincidental. He didn't actually DO ANYTHING in this novel, which, to me is the worst part. I'll still purchase the next Prey novel fresh off the presses, because I've got faith in Mr. Sandford. He just happened to have an off day, and unfortunately, it shows in this book."
2,"Oh well, they can't all be great","This is worse than Easy Prey. And not because Lucas is an old married man but because he seems to have lost all of his detecting ability. What happened to the logical, game playing brain? Where are the brilliant leaps of intuitive insight? Where is the sex appeal? Where is the intensity? Where is Lucas Davenport?!!!Aside from the character being less than exciting, I found the the plot development to be lacking. When the reader knows from the beginning ""who done it"", the author must engage your attention with the clever ways in which the hero figures it out."
4,A competent mystery with unusual elements,"Sandford's Prey mysteries, featuring Minnesota investigator Lucas Davenport, are always competently written. This one is unusual because of two elements: a homeless person who witnesses a murder, flees, and regains a respectable life, and a cell of American communists who act as if the Cold War never ended. Sandford's descriptions of bleak northern Minnesota towns are effective, if depressing.Sandford introduces a potentially interesting character in a Russian female police officer who accompanies Davenport as he investigates, but she never plays a really significant role. The morally ambiguous ending may leave some readers unsatisfied. One quibble with the series: Davenport's wealth makes him seem like someone we would never know."
3,Not the John Sandford I'm accustomed to,"God knows where Sandford got this plot from. As a firm devotee of his ""Prey"" series I struggled to get through it. Not the usual taut, faced-paced and intelligent crime genre novel that one is used to if one admires Sandfor's writing and his character Lucas Davenport. Stick to real violence John, and leave the subtle plot notions alone."
1,The worst of the Prey novels,"This is an extremely disappointing book. The plot is boring and slow because Davenport doesn't do much but go from one murder scene to the other. He is more a crime scene tourist than a detective. Nothing he does moves to solve the case. Nothing! A passive hero is a classic writing 101 mistake.The Russian intelligence officer is also a cliche. I suppose her ""What is this ____? What is this ____?"" is intended to be humorous but it gets old very fast."
4,Do Cops Have to be Single to do Their Job?,"If you read the posts, you know what the book is about so I will not go into that. I have read every Prey book from the beginning and have enjoyed them but will agree that some are better than others.One reveiwer said that ""Weather had won"". What that means essentially is that any cop who wants to be a tough, ""pedal to the metal"", edgy, ready to fight, must be single. A cop can't have it both ways, he can't be married and be a good tough cop? I have to disagree with that and I wonder how many married cops would also disagree.It took years to get Davenport married and have a family of his own so let him enjoy his wife and son and not go through the agnoy of death and/or divorce. Let him continue to solve crimes because no one can do it better than he can."
2,Winding down..in more ways than one,"I kinda agree with the general feeling on this one...the plot is thick and slow and sluggish and the ending is a major let down.The subtle hints that Davenport is looking into new careers and is tired of the politics hints that the series is winding down. Maybe, maybe not, but that's no excuse for sloppy and lazy writing. I love Sandford's other books (except for shadow prey, never could get interested enough in that one to finish it) and it's sad to see him turn out trash.It does continue the story though, and for that I was thankful. It was nice to be back in Davenport's Minnesota and visit with him and Weather and Del and Andreno. It's like coming home.This is nowhere near the caliber of Mind Prey (which is by far the best in the series, fighting for top spot with Mortal Prey) but it's a Davenport book nonetheless.Enjoy...and if nothing else read this just because it continues the story."
3,Maybe it was my mistake,"I thought I was ordering a hardback book. The book I received was a paperback. Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't want paperback books."
5,Hidden Prey,"Another great ""Prey"" book from John Sanford. They are great. I love them all. I read all of them on my ""Kindle"" or my ""iPhone"", and can switch back and forth and the Kindle and the iPhone app can take me to the last page I read on either one."
4,Foreign Intrigue,"This one is a change of pace for John Stanford. To include Russian spies and murders in Minnesota keeps you thinking, like is this still happening and recent news stories indicate that it is and probably will continue."
1,No prayer for this Prey,"I never thought I would say this, but this Prey novel can only be described as BORING!!! The plot is left over from the Cold War, the characters are flat, and if you look up the word ""plodding"" in the dictionary there is a picture of Hidden Prey.Let me sum it up like this: Lucas Davenport has gone from a very cool Mpls. cop with a Porsche, lots of money, and an attitude to a older married civil servant driving an Acura...whoopdee-do! Save your money and your time, and skip this one. You won't be missing a thing."
2,Dissappointed,Certainly not his best effort. Not enough action and the story line was dull. Very easy to put down and forget to pick up again. I liked the main character better before he settled down.
2,"I ""prey"" his next one is better!","I read 2 books in between trying to finish this one. It started out kind of interesting...a murder witnessed by a homeless woman. But then boring, boring! The premise is just too ridiculous. A young man tries to fulfill his great-grandfather's spy ties to the Soviet Union from decades past.Oh, John, I know you can do better!"
4,Sandford Pleases Once Again,"Over and over Sandford has made happy people out of those who decide to follow the tales and escapades of Lucas Davenport. This time using the old tensions left from the Cold War, Sandford lures us in with tales of espionage and times forgotten. He uses past fears of the indominable Russians to help keep the reader on edge. A real page turner."
2,Mediocre -- 2 1/2 Stars!,"Usually I buy and read a Prey book from Sandford soon after it hits the store. However, due to the very mixed reviews Hidden Prey received I put off reading it until about a week ago. Bottom line is I should have avoided this book -- at best, it's mediocre. The plot (which is described in detail in other reviews) started off interesting but became much too drawn out and, ultimately, somewhat boring. Further, the character of Lucas Davenport is much more subdued in Hidden Prey than other Prey books, making him less appealing, and the ""bad guys"" (grandpa and grandson) are not very well developed and lack credibility. While Sandford let me down in Hidden Prey, he still remains one on my top tier authors and I plan to read his latest, Broken Prey, soon."
2,"Well written, but boring","A good way to ruin a story is to add too many complicated plot twists. This book goes completely the other way, having no real twists and turns. Lucas Davenport returns to investigate the murder of the son of a rich and powerful Russian businessman along with help from a female Russian ""cop"". The problem is there is no real suspense. They basically figure out each step as they go. The complimentary characters are thin and entrirely too predictable. Even when the main storyline was revealed I was left asking ""So What?"". Bottom line is I found the book to be well-written, but the story very thin and dull."
3,It's up to you,"This is my first Sandford novel.I normally don't like repeat characters/series as I feel that it shows a lack of creativity, etc. However he was rec'd to me so I decided to give it a try.I liked the manner in which this book was written -- short scenes, quick, funny dialogue. But the story itself was typical. I say typical b/c it's what you expect from a novel with recycled characters: references to other books/stories, an open ending to allow for future sales, etc.If you want a quick, fun read: say for vacation or on the plane, then this is your book.Great writer, so-so story."
3,Mediocre Prey,"This book was entertaining simply due to the fact that John Sanford is an excellent writer. The plot was not that interesting and it seemed to drag in parts. There were some very funny parts (Weather driving through the garage door was hilarious)but the book lacked the edge of your seat, page turning, unable to put down type of story that draws me to the Prey series every year. Though Lucas is getting older, married, and a father, he does not have to lose his edge. I sure hope the next installment will get Lucas really pissed and regain his edge."
3,"Boring, but had its moments","I really enjoy Lucas books, but this one dragged on and was kinda wimpy, in my opinion.Still, any Lucas novel is worth reading..."
5,John Sandford's Prey Series...,"I've read the bulk of the Lucas Davenport books, not counting a few at the front or the more recent titles. But judging the spines of my paperbacks, I'd have to vote 'Hidden Prey' -- No. 15 -- as the best in this series. And I think 'The Hanged Man's Song' is the best of his Kidd novels."
1,cannot recommend!!,i started at the beginning with the prey books and have enjoyed the ones i've read so far...not this one...absolutely ridiculous plot and made no sense. it was about a group of old russian spies but there was never any real purpose revealed for their existence.this has to be one of those books that had to be written just to meet a publisher's deadline...what a disappointment.
3,Not his best but readable,"I am a fan of John Sandford's and have read all of his previous Lucas Davenport books. With the last four or five novels, I have noticed that Sandford is making the books lighter and easier to read with Davenport becoming more likable. This makes for a quick read but is disappointing for long-term fans like myself who appreciated the darkness of the earlier novels.The plot to this book was quite average and to me, did not contain the depth of research or the complexity of plotting that I have come to expect from the author."
5,Just the beginning,"I met Matt at a No Doubt concert in 2004, when he was one of the sidestage acts. He was a great performer and a nice guy, really easy to talk to and chill. I had heard him perform a few songs, but when I listened to his EP I was blown away. I highly recommend this CD for several reasons- first of all, it's great music. All the songs have a different style and vibe to them, ""Astair"" being my personal favorite. However, they all flow togther very nicely, and the music is beauitful and simple- untampered and at its best and purest form. Another reason I would recommend this EP is because this is only the beginning. Matt's music has been featured on MTV's Road Rules X-TREME, and he's going on tour wirh Jack Johnson. His full length-CD, Songs We Sing, is due out very shortly. Matt is going to be around for a lot longer, and it's a good thing."
5,Wow is all i can say,"This is actually my first cd by the Spin Doctors. I didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad I bought it. The lyrics are alright, but what really stands out is how catchy the vocals and guitars are together. I'll be listening to this cd for the next few months quite often.Good job guys."
3,Priced-down re-release of Cardcaptos: The Movie,"This edited American version of 'Cardcaptor Sakura: The movie' is aimed for kids who have enjoyed the dubbed version of the show on tv. In this movie, Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong and brings Tori, Julian, and Madison (Toya, Yukito, and Tomoyo in the Japanese original) with her. They meet up with Li Showron (Li Shaoran) and Meilin, and faces the evil sorceress Su Yung, who hates Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow cards. The show has been edited so that Sakura's crush on Julian is non-existant, and some battle scenes have been removed.This dvd is a priced-down release of the same movie released in March 2002, and despite the changes made from the original Japanese version and the new cover design, it is worth the buy if you do not intend to purchase the unedited billingual dvd of this movie released by Pioneer. It's a bargain!"
3,Nice bottle - not as pictured,I purchased the Dansk Caribe Oil bottle as a present for my sister. It arrived and is two tones of green not green and orange as pictured. It was also more squarish in shape. She still liked the bottle and kept it. She did call the supplier and found our that the Dansk Caribe line has been redesigned.A potential buyer should be aware that the bottle and other items from the line may be different than the images advertised. I hope updated images soon appear on the Amazon website.
3,Different,"When I first got the DVD I was expecting it to be like the ones that I have on tape. but when the new Kimba DVD arrived it was a different version then mine. My mood dropped like a liquid thrmometer on a cold day. I got so mad that I was just about ready to sell it. I desided not to. In the version I'm used to, Yvonne Murray does the voice of Kimba and I prefer her voice overs to Billy Low Wat. I was not born in the 60's, I was born in 1993. One day this summer I was flicking chanels when something caught my eye. I quickly switched back to canel 35 and there it was, Kimba. As I continued to watch it, I began to fall in love with it. Shows today have so much junk in them. This DVD version of Kimba doesn't come close to the originals from the 60s that I have on tape. This DVD has taught me that voices can change everything. Sincerely Eric Flegal age 13"
3,m 2 m 3 paolo rivero versus paolo serrano,"while highly erotic, m2m is failing to push beyond certain points tooffer TRUELY HIGH EROTIC films. no subtitling as ususal ( most times don't need it in these films ) i still would have liked to know what was said.actors were excellent but guarded at most points"
4,Big book,"It's hard to cover EVERYTHING related to biomaterials in one book, but the topics that are covered in this book are done so in detail. I don't really like how the book is pretty much a collection of works, but I understand how this allows each topic to be covered by an expert in that field. Overall, I find this book to be very useful in all of my classes."
4,Good book,"I felt this was a good book. I didn't actually use it too much in my course, but that's due to the professor. From the little bit that I used it, it seemed good."
2,Not a good textbook,"I had this book required for a class, and although it certainly has a lot of information, it is a very poor textbook especially for an introduction. There is WAY too much information on some subjects and unnecessary detail. It reads more like a collection of peer reviewed articles than it does a textbook. The authors need to learn to HIGHLIGHT the important results and summarize information in a concise way. Even graphs are presented in very confusing manner (variable symbols not consistent in comparable graphs. Many authors also makes for different style changes...Then again, I have little background in biology, and only moderate interest in the subject, so that might slant my opinion."
2,doesn't function properly,Train can not run up on track to close the gates. I had to tape it down so the train could continue to run.
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed Only His, and I am now almost finished with the whole Only series. Compared to Only Mine, Only His pales in comparison, but it's still a pretty good book. It was about equal to Only You. I am now on Only Love, which also seems to be really good. I think just about equal with Only Mine. I would suggest reading this series if you enjoy Elizabeth Lowell's writing. Read the WHOLE series from beginning to finish, so that you can better understand things that refer to events that happened in the previous books. Lowell always gives believable storylines and characters that you fall in love with. I don't think I've ever been disapointed by one of her novels."
3,"Okay, but similar plots........","I agree with reader from Singapore. The book is quite okay, but the plots are very similar with her other 'Only' books.It's okay for fun reading, but for keeps? Naaah........ there are other Elizabeth Lowell's books worth keeping. Not this one, sorry."
1,BORING!!!,"I too had the unabridged recorded book. It was a major yawn and I kept thinking when it would ever end. I found myself fast-forwarding through the tapes waiting for Caleb to met-up with Reno, the brother of Willow. Well after fastwarding through many tapes still no meeting with Reno. Unfortunately, I cannot torture myself any longer. The pain must end; therefore, I will not finish this book.Do not waste your money by purchasing this book. Luckily, I got it from the public library."
5,"My favorite ""Only""","I adore this book. I have one clean copy and one I have re-read until it is barely holding together. Caleb and Willow are two of the best characters I have come across in historical romance, and Lowell makes magic with them in this book. If you have ever read a book where the author doesn't focus enough on the main couple, then this is the book for you. They are alone together for most of the story, so you really get to know them. The trip they take to look for Willow's brother is harrowing, and keeps me on the edge of my seat even now that I know how it all works out. I find myself rooting for them through all their hardships, and even cheering for the horses who become almost like characters in their own right. Lowell's writing is in fine form, with vivid descriptions of the majestic scenery that make you feel like you are there, along with well-rounded dialogue and steamy love scenes that keep the reader glued to the pages. This is truly one of Lowell's best works."
1,Ho Hum.,"Scanning through the reviews, I was beginning to think that this book read better than it sounded on tape (unabridged version by Recorded Books), but I finally found a review that mirrored mine. I have read some very, very, good books by Elizabeth Lowell, but she struck out on this one. I found myself fast-forwarding through the .... scenes because the dialogue was so cliche, and it was so much it was BORING. All I wanted was to hear about the fireworks that I expected to occur when Caleb met up with Reno. All there was was Fizzle. I checked out the Only You book on tape (unabridged, also by Recorded Books), but am returning it to the library without wasting my time. Try the first 2 books in the Jade series by Elizabeth Lowell."
2,Not a winner,"`Only His' is one of the 4 books of the `Only' series. Caleb Black, a hard man with an even harder heart. That is the picture you will get when you start off with the first few chapters of the book. Willow Moran, the civil war left her home torn apart and her an orphan. Her only loved one left are her brothers and when her brother Matthew Moran wrote home for help, she entrusted her fate to Caleb Black. What she does not know is that Caleb is using her to seek out her brother for revenge.The book started off with their journey through the wilderness with vivid description, much too vivid and much too long. Through chapters 1 to 15, it was all about the journey. And when the time comes for the showdown between Matthew and Reno, readers will be sorely disappointed. The build up was so long, the showdown so anticipated and it only last for a few sentences.I have enjoyed a few of Lowell's books, but this one was just plain boring. It was too long winded and I should say lacking."
2,Monotonous,"I bought this book in hopes of reading another as good as Only mine. This book was so sickening with the sexual innuindos and repeated insinuations that I found myself rolling my eyes while I was reading it. I thought they would never reach their destination and by page 100, I didn't care anymore. Skip this one."
2,It ok,"This product was just OK. I have thick course shoulder length hair. It was a heavy and thick conditioner, which is great, I thought it would weigh down my massive hair. Well, it didn't. It just slid off my hair when rinsed. It did take some of the wave out of my hair, but it did not straighten it. It also has no fragrance. I was hoping it would at least smell good. Nope."
4,Marc Anthony Straight Conditioner & Shampoo ok,"It definitely helps to use a straightening shampoo, the one by Marc Anthony is alright, but not the best. The Yes to Cucumbers shampoo and conditioner made my hair straight. Still searching for the one that provides straight hair with body at the root."
5,Who done it????,"I loved the book! I sometimes thought I knew ""who done it"" but in the end I was fooled. Great read."
3,problem,"Hi!According to the Bayreuth Festival site, the conductor ofMeistersinger there with this cast in 1964 was Robert heger and not Karl Boehm. Can someone help to solve this problem?Best wishes"
4,Good Muffler,"Megan Racing makes a good product for a reasonable price. I picked up a Honda Civic from a guy, and it was straight-piped from the cat back, so it sounded like angry angry bees that had a cold; sounded terrible...Had a local muffler guy weld this on for me, and big difference. The sound is good, and doesn't sound like most horrible exhausts for Hondas and the like. Rich, warm tone, and not like an angry angry 17 year old. It quieted things down nicely from the straight pipe, gave it a nice tone, and still flows well; also helped to not loose quite as much back pressure from having no muffler on an N/A car.+1 from me."
1,Tech support admits does not work with wireless mice,"I bought this device to hook up a Logitech wireless mouse via a Linksys KVM switch to 2 PCs. The mouse motion was erratic and tended to overshoot the target screen item. Installed latest mouse drivers, no effect. Tried hooking mouse directly to PCs, works fine. Tried hooking KVM switch directly to PCs, also works fine. Problem is clearly with the USB/PS2 converter. Called technical support at IOGEAR who admitted that they have problems with some cordless mice - they recommended I return the device. At least they were honest, but it would have been better if their product worked properly."
5,"Frothy, yet filling","For me as for most Americans the Ivy League is some remote planet about which I know little and care less. But Ms. Peterfreund can write, she can plot, she can develop interesting characters. The reader moves effortlessly into and through her quaint world. Maybe not a candidate for the ""Great American Novel"" but there's a lot to be said for a darn good read."
4,Bugaboo,"Ok, in five days I read all four books. Whew, the first one I absolutely loved and was excited to get into the second. Enjoyed that one too. The third was good and a bit crazy and the forth brought it full circle. By the time I got to the forth book I was so just wanting to finish.... Four books is a lot and think it would have been better to lengthen the first three not to have the forth. While I was tired by the end of the marathon read..... now a few hours after finishing the forth and final book. I miss Amy. There is nothing more to read... Amy..... Bugaboo - are you going to charge me $2?A great read, only complaint is I got tired of the lists."
3,the snap button are a bit of a pain,This is a great wrap from a material point of view.But they chose to fix the wrap by snap buttons (white on white) that are a pain to snap.It would be a perfect product if they had put scratch instead.
1,sent a dirty napkin instead of robe,"The package arrived priority mail, and it was filthy.i ORDERED A WHITE TERRY CLOTH WRAP AROUND ROBE. Inside was a dirty green napkin from a restaurant, and stick on numbers. DON'T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY SOMETHING IS WRONG."
5,Love the wrap!,Received the wrap in a timely fashion. The quality of the wrap is excellent. Texture is very soft. I just order 2 more for my family members.
4,Shower Wrap,I was very pleased with the shower wrap - ordered one for myself and one for my granddaughter.
3,Disappointed,"Drawings dry out and dissapear before you can even finish them. We found it a bit frustrating. Also, I was planning to take it with us on a trip to Europe to keep my daughter entertained on the plane but it is way too bulky.I do like the fact that the pens are filled with water since the first things my daughter did was try to taste them and then draw on the wall.Overall, I won't recommend it as a good buy."
4,I only wish it came in more colors,"If you do lots of potlucks like I do, this is a perfect dish to use. Light, sturdy, pretty, and hard to damage while hauling it around. If it came in more colors, I'd buy more. I have other enamel platters, but they're bigger and hard to maneuver in the car. This is just right."
5,Best book on wolfdogs available,"This is by far the best book on wolfdogs that I have read (and I have read both of Nicole Wilde's books as well as Ms. Prendergast's other book, The Wolf Hybrid). It starts out very realistically, with stories of wolfdogs being euthanized simply for being what they are (or for being misrepresented as wolfdogs when they were really just husky/shepherd mutts). It also has a good section on containment and what to do when you go on vacation (because let's face it, vacationing with a wolfdog is a very difficult thing to do)."
1,"Original is great, translation is unreadable.","I have read this book in Czech and it's great, unfortunately, the translation is really bad. It almost feels like someone sat down with a dictionary and just looked up all the words. This really doesn't work when you are going from Czech to English. The structure of sentences is often all wrong. It is gathering dust on my shelf and I have only read about ten pages."
5,Favorite book to read to my child,This is by far my favorite book to read to my child. I love the flow of it and the art is beautiful. It really is an adorable book. Highly recommend.
5,We love Llama Llama!,"This is such a great story with great illustrations. My daughter loves it, and so do I! Little Llama learns patience while waiting for mama llama. Highly recommended!"
5,Llama -Rama!,"Love, love, love the llama books! We read frequently to our 4 month old and she screeches in delight when read this series of books. The pictures are bright and colorful and the little llama's expressions are priceless. I give this book as gifts and it has yet to disappoint. The llama family is probably in our top 5 books!"
5,Cute and Funny,This is a great book that my son loves and even cracks me and my husband up when we read. Well written!
4,GreatBooksLover,"Our 2 1/2 year old likes this book. He does not get scared when sees ""eye wide open"" llama. He also does not seem to model the behavior of the main character. Maybe I read it to him in a funny way, poking fun of the way llama acts. When llama moans, I read it making a moaning sound. When he cries out for mama, I read it raising my voice a bit. Our son laughs a lot and anticipates certain moments in the book. He also likes the illustrations, and some make him smile/laugh."
3,"Fun to read text, cute llama.","I think its a good bedtime book, though some of the reviewers have a point that little llama looks extremely anxious at some points, and i certainly don't believe in not responding to my child's cries (mama llama waits until she hears the screams and then reprimands little llama for not being patient). Still, my son was fine with the book and anticipates mama llamas return."
5,Great book for 2 year old,"I purchased this book sight unseen due to a recommendation from the Texas libraries (they have it on their list of recommended books for 2 year olds). My 28 month old daughter absolutely loves this book. She has me read it to her over and over and over again and has started chiming in with her own narration (e.g., ""Mama's downstairs"" and ""Mama's on the phone"" when she sees the pictures). The illustrations are great and I love the big text. I highly recommend this to anyone with children around age 2."
2,Cute but provoked even more bedtme fear for my 3 year old,"Adorable book and my toddler enjoyed it, however the first night after we read it, she had loads of trouble falling asleep and was mimicking some of the antics the llama uses in the story with his mama. After a few nights of reading the story, and again more antics, we had to return it. If you have a child who gets easily scared at bedtime, I would not get this book."
5,It makes him giggle,"My 14 month old grandson has been enjoying this book for a few months now. For the last couple of months he's made it clear that this one is his favorite. When I ask him if he wants me to read his Llama Llama book he smiles and then when he sees me holding it he wiggles and giggles with glee. He says ""yama yama"" and settles in for at least two readings in a row...sometimes he requests a third. The whole family likes to read this book to him and we all add sound effects like ""ring ring"" and actually humming a tune. He loves books in general but this one is by far, his favorite."
5,Very fun to read.,"I wont say much except this is a very fun book to read. Since we've read the book our new baby has been nicnamed Llama llama. She loves to look at the big, bright pictures."
5,Fun for baby and fun for Mama!,"Both my 18 month old and 4 year old love this book. The illustrations are adorable. The added bonus is it is fun for adults too. I find many children's books to be poorly written, dull or without a message. This book is all around well done. I look forward to it as much as the kids do. I highly recommend."
5,Entertaining!!!,"My kids current favorite books for bedtime are the ""Mama Llama"" books. My children's ages are 2.5 and 1. These books have big bright pictures with cute rhyming. They even keep our 1 year old's attention. Llama Llama Red Pajamas is good for a bedtime story. I highly recommend this book for children ages 1-4."
3,"Great premise, but slightly negative story","I must agree that our young child loves this book, however as a parent I find the story somewhat negative. The premise of a young child asleep and shouting to get his mama's attention, then crying and the mama getting angry is not what I would prefer for a book - lets save that for reality!"
5,My 2.5 year old loves the llama llama series!,"I was reccomended this book by ABCJesuslovesme.com as part of my daughters red week. She loves it. She will pick it over any book when given the choice. She is 2.5 and is already starting to read, she likes that she knows most of the words. I like that it deals with a common child ""fear"" also the rhyming."
5,All my kids love this book,"I have a four year old and twin 2 year old boys and they all love this book. The two year olds ask to read it again and again (I got it from the library and now have to buy it because they miss the book so much now that I've returned it!). I had actually worried that they might be scared by the picture where the baby llama is crying for his mama, but they didn't find it scary, and we actually used the book to talk about how they shouldn't be scared - the final message in the book is really important for all kids to understand - that even if mommy isn't in the room, mommy is close by and loves you. I think it's a great book..."
1,Boring,Didn't tell a story it was more of a poem. Didn't hold my toddlers attention. Wish I could return it.
1,I dissagree with the message of this book,"I think that this book shows how not to be a loving mom. The ideas presented thought this book are very parent task oriented and do not show the importance of spending time with your child and not just leaving them alone while you get your own ""stuff"" done. Children need to be held, loved, carried, nursed, comforted, and their needs meet. If you are not around your child how can you possibly do these things."
5,great,My kids love this book and they make me read it over and over every night. pics are really good too
4,bedtime stories,"Llama Llama Red Pajama was a cute little story, that is about what most kids do at bedtime! My 2 year old granddaughter loved the story. It wasn't too long, and it held her attention."
3,Boring reader,The voice on this recording has little to no excitement at those pivotal moments in the story. I would have done better to record it myself....
5,Mama Llama Mama Llama.. that's all I hear everyday!,"Very quick review just to say that I now have this book memorized due to the 6 times daily I read this to my daughter who is 19 months. She asks over and over all day Mama llama mama llama mama llama!! until either I hide it and distract her with other things, or give in and read it... again. It's actually fantastically written, has excellent artwork, facial expressions are perfect, and just an overall great and easy to read story. Not to mention it's very easy for a parent to get animated reading this book unlike so many others.Great book for all little ones!"
5,Mamma reads to her little Llama,"Llama Llama is one of our daughters favorite books and one of our favorites to read to her. The pictures and expressions mixed with the books simple rhymes make for a fun reading experience. Our daughter loves to point at the pictures and try her best version of the word ""Llama"" but it comes out more like ""ama"".Our daughter likes this book so much that we tend to take it on trips with us and read to her before bed. It has become her ""Night Night"" book. We also recently ordered the other books in this series called ""Mad at Mamma"" & ""Missing Mamma"" but they have not be delivered yet.Overall just a great little kids book with fun rhymes that you and your family can enjoy. I highly recommend this book."
5,LLama llama red Pajama Great story,"I love reading this book to my son he is 4yrs old and i been reading this to him for about a year, 3 to 4 times a night for bedtime, and he never gets tired of it. Its a good bedtime story."
5,Wonderful fun,"My wife and I love reading this book to our son. If it were a board book, it would be perfect."
1,Horrible book about a mother who ignores her child's pleas!!,"As an eductor and a mother of a 2yr old, I was shocked at the reviews this book is getting. This book is about a mother who is busy on the phone, with her dishes, etc., and does not go to her terrified child. You can see from his eyes, he is really scared, not pulling any games or being dificult. She leaves him screaming on his bed till she is ready to get to him. Does she console him and let him know everything is ok? NO!!! She scolds him. It is one thing to want to teach self soothing, it is another to abandon a child in obvious emotional distress and then scold him for it.I checked this out of the library in hopes that it would help me son go to bed better. NO WAY would I read him this. The message is.."" If I am busy, you will have to wait, no matter how distressed you are"".. Not the message I would ever send my son. Too bad for this series because Llama, Llama Mad at Mamma has been a huge hit around my house."
1,Not in my house please,"I thought the pictures and the depiction of a child's abandonment anxiety were spectacular. It was only when I got to the page where the mother is standing at the foot of the baby llama's bed glaring at her shame-faced child (shaming the child for all that ""llama drama"" of screaming out in terror that mama hadn't come when the baby llama had called) that I wished the editor's had skipped the climax of the story. Other than this page it was wonderful."
1,horrified 2 year old,"my 2 1/2 year old was horrified by this book. he is extremely bright and very sensitive and he never wanted to see this book again (we received it as a gift and subsequently donated to the library). he thought the book was ""too scary"" and that the llama ""was sad"" and could not understand why the mama llama woud not ""help him because he is just little"" (the quotes are from my son). just some thoughts from my 2 year old......."
1,insensitive to little ones,"A scared little llama calls for his mama, who is doing dishes on the phone, and when she finally comes, in what seems like a long time, she scolds him for the ""llama drama"" before hugging him. My little one cries at the sight of the scared llama screaming for his mama. not a fit for this family."
1,this book teaches messed-up values,"This was a horrible book. The Mama Llama abandons her terrified child to go do the dishes and stays gone while he continues to cry, escalating to screaming and wondering if his mom is gone entirely. I feel this is a book written by parents who use the cry-it-out (or, as my husband calls it, cry it in) method of getting their kids to sleep, and is designed to convince kids that it's okay for their parents to abandon them when they are distraught. A word for Mama Llama- rock or nurse your llama llama red pajama to sleep, and then there will be plenty of time for dishes."
5,Great book for a toddler who won't sit still for story time!,"My Grandma purchased this book for my kids because she thought it looked cute. My daughter, who is 3, loves to read books at night, but my son, 20 months, will not sit still long enough to get past a title. That is, until we started reading Llama,Llama. When it is time for a bed time story and I ask him to get a book, that is the one he always grabs. The same goes for my nephew, who is 14 months. He is just as wild and crazy as my son, but he will sit still for this book. Too cute!"
5,Best book ever!,"My son hated to sit and read/hear stories until we found this book. He is 19 months old and loves to hear me read this book. We read it twice before bed each night and so far, it hasn't gotten on my nerves! I would definitely recommend it!"
2,Advanced International Trade: Theory and Evidence,"I really expected far more from this textbook. It adds very little to already existing graduate textbooks on trade. It is not useful for graduate students that want to understand the literature of the 2000s. It assumes you already know the material. It debotes a lot of space to the old literature at the expense of the new one. This is a field that has changed significantly. Frankly, I find hard to see its value added."
3,Hellfire and brimstones!! still a bargain!,"I am jealous of the other reviewer who got a copy at only 12000 dollars!But the price is actually a pretty big bargain.Let me clarify, it comes with your own personal holy spirit, piece of the trinity, impregnator of Mary. It wouldn't be christian to sell such a treasure for any less."
4,I found this book to be very good for the begining soaper,"This book gives all of the basic information and includes lots of recipies. For a little book, it packs in a ton of information from the history of soap to your basic soap recipie to exotic soap recipies."
1,Not for beginners,I found this book to be boring and not at all helpful. I have never made soap but I am trying to learn. This wasn't something I found useful!
2,yeech,"This is the thing..the book does have some good recipes,however, it is incredibly boring, and i really do not like the way this lady jumps from one subject to another. Case and point: I want to learn about rendering beef tallow, ok? She is doing o.k explaining this and then suddenly, she jumps to lard, then how storing your already rendered tallow near onions will make it smelly, how unclean tallow will make your soap smelly, cooking potatoes in your smelly tallow to make it smell better...oh, what were we talking about? Oh yes, the process of rendering... More like the inner ramblings of a seasoned soaper pretending to have her own talk show while she makes soap."
5,The art of soap making,"Good reference book. I spent 3 months studying soap making chemistry and this one had a lot of good tips, good tables and references for making my own formuli, and it seems to have some nice pre-created ones as well, though I have not used any of them. I prefer to create my own recipies with what I have on hand. But I like having a good easy to use reference book on the subject."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I should have returned it, but I didn't. I will more than likely sell it in a garage sale, or donate it to the library."
3,Little old-fashioned,"Good information if you're Canadian. A little hard to understand at times if you're not, but most of the recipes aren't current."
1,Memorex discs for Sony Mavica CD Digital camera,I ordered 4 packs of 5 for a Sony Mavica CD digital camera. I was only able to format 5 out of 20 discs successfully. All others ended with a format error. It could be the camera but I doubt it because of the fact that 5 out of the 20 formatted successfully.
4,Cut the cheese,"My long-time cheese cutter finally cut the cheese for the last time, so I replaced it with this one. It does the job nicely, and the roller keeps the slices consistent."
5,The Legacy of Alan Watts,Alan Watts introduced a whole generation of Westerners to the ideas of Eastern Philosophy and Religion and this book is no exception
4,Sue Grafton continues to impress!,"Kinsey Millhone is an absolute delight in 'E is for Evidence'. This is the second-time around in rereading most of her mysteries in the alphabet series ... and she was great the first-time round & continued her fantastic story-telling with EVIDENCE. If there is any criticism, perhaps she is often too unnecessarily descriptive with her environs; nonetheless, I highly recommend most of her novels as totally fun, intriguing 'reads'."
3,O for Ok,"Curiosity about these alphabet mysteries led me to purchase this one. If this was her best, according to some of the Amazon reviewers, I probably will not read more. It was kind of like a movie-of-the-week (or movie-of-the-weak?)type material. Nevertheless, I did finish it, so it wasn't all that bad."
3,"Good Writing, Good Plot, Good Detective, Good Characters","Sue Grafton truly cannot be classified as a cliche mystery writer. Her writing is filled with wit and humor. Even at the most dramatic stages of the story, Kinsey Milhone (the first-person detective) will throw in a statement that will make you chuckle. In addition, I liked the fact that the plot revolved around the well-to-do Wood family and the family intrigue that seems to accompany much of ""the aristocracy."" Good for what it tries to accomplish; nevertheless, I feel that Grafton's alphabet series has declined slightly since her first three novels. If you are gaga about mysteries, this one is good. Unlike some writers' styles, Grafton's is Mystery with a small subplot of Rommance, not vice-versa."
3,"Not her best, but still worth reading.","I was not as Impressed with 'E is for Evidence' as I was with other Kinsey Millhone mysteries. This book starts of just a bit oo slow, and then it gets just too unbelievable. I still would not want to miss it, though, since it features Daniel, one of Kinsey's Ex-husbands."
4,an exceptionally entertaining detective fiction,"Kinsey, a wise-cracking but lovable ex-cop, now a private eye, thirty-two and twice divorced--no kids, takes on the most important client of her detective career, herself. She is funny and keenly observant, but this time she is caught unaware, and she's not laughing. She's been framed! She stands to lose everything if she doesn't solve the mysteries surrounding this case and clear her name. Sue Grafton has delivered her readers another exceptionally entertaining detective fiction."
4,Grafton triumphs again in this fifth outing.,"Seasoned loner Kinsey Millhone meets the family of an old school friend while investigating an industrial fire. Under suspicion herself, she nevertheless manages to solve the puzzle while also dealing with the return of her ne'er-do-well ex-husband."
3,"E is for ""Exuberant""!","I am 14 years old and my mom suggested these books to me and I thought, gee whiz! Another boring mystery series. Don't get me wrong, I love to read but I can't stand teen series'. Finally my mom persuaded me to read one ('A' is for Alaibi) and I loved it! The best one I've read yet is 'G' is for Gumshoe. I highly recommend these books for anyone with a thirst for something new and rich."
4,"Comfortable, reduces reflux","I own a captain's bed, so using the innovative angled frame underneath a box spring was not an option. I couldn't raise the head of the bed by poor man's means either (bricks, etc.) because of the bed's style. After looking at several options, I tried this inclined pad. It provides an angle that goes from head to toe. Yes, it's a foam topper so it will ultimately need to be replaced. However, I've been using it for two months and it has maintained its incline. I find it supportive without being stiff. I've suffered less from reflux getting into my upper esophagus and sinuses while laying in bed.It had a rubber smell when I unpacked it but after a few days, it dissipated. Also, an ""extra deep"" mattress pad is needed to cover the pad and mattress."
1,Piece of Crap,I have been using this product for quite few weeks and I feel it is a piece of crap. I strongly advice not to buy this after my experience. Odor was gone after couple of days but it is very soft and is not good for sleeping. Everyday i have been waking up with back pain after using this product and it is not that easy to return after it has taken full shape. We have to carefully pack it for return but not sure how we can or you have to dump it in trash.
4,So far so good!,"We've had this mattress topper for about a month now. So far it's working well. I have GERD and need to have the head of the bed elevated. Our main challenge was finding sheets that will go over it and the mattress, but we did find some 22"" sheets that work well. I'm interested in learning how long the foam topper retains its ""lift"" and how soon we'll have to replace it."
2,Not as advertised,"I am one of those people who are required medically to sleep on a definite incline-my husband enjoys sleeping flat, so I have to rely on a sleep wedge. This one definitely does NOT have a 5"" height at the top. These things are impossible to repackage and return, or I would have. The one before was good and had a zipper cover, but broke down in less than 6 months. The one after that I just received appears to als be about 4"" instead of 5"" in maximum height. I'm not sure why we can't receive what we've ordered."
5,Awesome Sleep Aid,"I purchased this in order to help my wife sleep by relieving her gurd problems. We installed it as soon as it arrived. No odor, no problems. To my surprise, her snoring stopped the first night. She sleeps better and I do too. Terrific product. I recommend it without reservation. It has made a difference in our lives."
2,Mishapened topper,"Unfortunately, when this item was received, it was so mashed down that the incline of the piece was hardly noticeable. It could not be used right away because the incline was not proper and we let it lay out in hopes that the shape it should be would return. Didn't return to normal.Not to happy."
3,Sheets don't fit,"Although I appreciate the elevation this mattress topper provides, it is impossible to use even deep pocket sheets to cover it. It would be helpful if there were a high-quality, tight-fitting sheet that fits only this topper."
5,great product,"For a person suffering from acid reflux it is a heavensend, also it is an extremely comfortable pad, so it is a win-win situation. would highly recommend it to anyone."
2,"Cute shoes online, horrible on feet","I like Steve Madden shoes, but the Steven line is always disappointing. Although the designs are sometimes nicer, the comfort and fit is horrible and these are no exception. I bought 3 pairs so far and am sending them all back. The first pair I bought in my size seemed to be too small because the elastic back is not adjustable and figured that was why they were so uncomfortable so I bought two more pairs half size larger only to have these look like I have clown feet and are huge, but still the elastic backing digs into my ankle. The style of these shoes is awesome and they are very cute, however the design is HORRIBLE and the fit is TERRIBLE. They are also very wide so if you don't have wide feet they will be too big widthwise. I was really hoping these would be comfortable platforms, but I have stilettos more comfortable than these. Not worth it to buy, even on sale!!!"
2,Heavy and Clumsy,"At this expense You'd expect fine leather and/or quality and good taste.These shoes aren't comfortable at all and when my niece wore them she complained a lot that her Feet Hurt !I don't recommend this shoe,total rip-off loser!"
2,Nice but very sore feet,These nice shoes.I got the red ones and by the end of a couple hours I had to take them off.I walked around in cotton socks for a couple days because my feet hurt so much.just wanted to share my expierience.
4,"A good account, but still waiting for a better one","On the whole, I was not disappointed by this book. It is a solid, workman-like account of Operation Bagration, told from the Red Army perspective, which is what I paid for. It is vastly superior to Adair's ""Hitler's Greatest Defeat"", but frankly that is a low bar to cross. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous.Given today's computer technology, the maps provided could be much, much better. I understand that Stackpole is a reprint publisher, but is it too much to ask to have spelling and grammar mistakes cleaned up from the original? A little proofreading would make Stackpole books much better.A lot of the book is taken up by laundry lists of Red Army formations participating in each operational sector, which could just as well have been relegated to an appendix.On the other hand, the book reads well, and the author has produced a strong narrative. I didn't gain any great new insights, but I certainly wasn't bored."
3,Knife sharpening stone,I used stone better than this. The coarse side is too rough and the fine side is not fine enough. I guess this ok for the price.
1,Overpriced,"I am an inventory clerk for a hotel in Nashville, TN and my entire job consists of looking these types of things up to find best prices. I know you can get these kits right now at home depot for $119.00 save your money!"
3,Nice looking but finicky,"These look great between our exposed rafters downstairs. Unfortunately, several of the lamps lose electrical contact over time. Quality is consistent with price."
3,not as flexible as it could be,I really needed this to be able to go with me. If it had been in the mp3 it would be much better. I don't really have time to sit at the entertainment center and spin this disc in the dvd player to enjoy these shows.They do sound good and the menus are great. Maybe I will someday figure out a way to use these -as I continue to morph into a nerd. But for now its a dust collector. And again - I'm glad to have them...
2,"not to my expectations - didn't look good, my baby cried too","I bought the small faux suede hattie for my little newborn boy because I thought from the picture that it was just the cutest thing in the world. When I received it, the hat didn't quite resemble what was pictured. The color wasn't as rich, and the plushness wasn't really what I had imagined. It was very thin, and I don't know that it will provide warmth in the cold, cold weather. Also, the few times I had it on my boy, it fell off because it was too loose. It's unfortunate, the product looked so cute and cuddly, but it really wasn't."
5,The Greek God,"Gianni Ploutarxos is one of the most hansome male artists. His music will touch you deep inside and every song of his, has deep meaning to it. I so far own 3 of his past albums however I believe that the above album is also a big success.This would be another album of his that I would have to add to my collection."
1,USB Cable Don't Work,"I purchased this item to extend the reach of my webcam. I plugged the active usb extension cable into my computer and rebooted and now the computer doesn't recognize the webcam. I then plugged my keyboard into the active usb extension cable and the computer doesn't recognize the keyboard either. I came back to the website to see if anybody else wrote a review which reported a similar problem. Either this cable is defective or there is some special procedure that must be employed to have the computer recognize a device plugged into it. At the moment, this item is totally useless."
3,Charlie Rose Interview with Cher,As a collector of Cher's music I enjoyed the DVD. A suprise that the interviewer had not done enough research and was unaware that Cher had a son. This did not do the great lady justice and was a bad oversight.
5,THE BEST ALBUM,"Great album...Hijo de la lunA, Hawai Bombai, great album, to RELAX. I AM A FUTURE PIANIST A WOULD LOVE TO PLAY LIKE ARTHUR.xoxo"
1,Land of Song Muffled,"The quality of this audio CD is surprising poor. Well known Welsh standards by the renowned Dunvant, Morriston Orpheus, Pontardudulais, Treochy choirs, and etc. come through hideously uneven. The soaring spirit and the soul of the Rhondda Valley sound which have characterized the Welsh male choirs since The Depression have been shackled and dampened by poor recording techniques.Suffice it to say, The Welsh Singers featured in the 1941 Oscar winning film ""How Green Was My Valley"" was better recorded than this 1997 offering."
4,Great Science Review Book for Praxis II!,Very helpful and easy to follow along--better review than what ETS has to offer on their website. A thorough review of all science you might have taken in HS--I highly reccommend you get this book! Save your money on getting ETS' and get this one instead!
3,Although Helpful Not Enough for the MS Praxis.,"This book is somewhat helpful, but you need other sources to be able to pass the Praxis Exam. The majority of the Praxis questions are basic Physics questions. You do not need physics in order to pass high school! So this book should act as a basic review. I just wanted to set the record straight for people recommending this book for the Praxis, because solely using this book you will not have a chance in hell!Don't make the same mistake I made! I was able to pass it 2nd time around with different sources. Thanks for listening!"
5,A healing book for the American Spirit,"When a biological weapons threatens Washington DC the people get there chance to take out a terrorist. One man carrying the latest in germ warfare has planned the attack with precision. Carefully detailing every step of the plan. The only thing he forgot was to plan for the American people. Our government, our troops may falter but our nation stands strong. This is must read for everyone that feels the need to thwart a terrorist plan."
5,Pet Supplements,"I purchased this calcium to add to my recipe for a raw supplement to be added to my dogs' kibble. It was recommended by Dr. Pitcairn. The order came within the time frame it was expected and I had no problems with the shipment. Amazon is terrific. Search, find, order, receive. Painless!"
5,Makes it easy to do it right,Bone meal can be difficult to calculate properly (even gets my holistic vet scratching her head). This is EASY -- 1 teas per pound of meat.Someone above mentioned it sticks to the spoon. I just take a new plastic spoon and store it in the bottle. Gives me consistency.
5,Just what I was looking for,"This product is so much easier to use than grinding up calcium tabs. Love the natural ingredients, too. I am using it for a pet duck who needs calcium for laying eggs, and she eats up what I sprinkle on her food just fine."
4,Reading Financial Reports for Dummies,Some prior knowledge of accounting is required. Written very well. Contents presented in a easy to understand format. Well done.
4,Books,Most of the books I had ordered were for information purposes. I loved each one of them because to me they provided invaluable information!
1,Not to my liking,"Buyer beware. I found this painful to listen to. Bill has something to say here but he's sooo monotone and can't carry a pitch! I really tried to find something to like but all I did was cringe. It's really... not good.Sorry, Bill...my copy is in the trash."
4,for History,This was for History. This book was in good condition and served its purpose. I would recommend it.to anyone that needs it..
3,There is a better book,"Discusses how FDR's new deal policies extended the dpression and hindered recovery. This is true, and reflects the results of modern research, but there is another recent book that covers the same ground a lot better: Rethinking the Great Depression by Smiley."
2,"OK, Where's the Tables?","For those who enjoyed this book, take a look in the index for ""GDP"". No mention of GDP. Flick through the book, try to find a graph or table of GDP growth under Roosevelt. Nope, not there.Possibly the reason for this omission by Powell is that, from the start of 1934 (using a 12-month policy lag time) to the end of 1941, real GDP grew *at a mean rate* of over 8% per year. Just for comparison, no GOP president has managed a growth rate matching this for a calendar year.Why should one take seriously a book about economic policy that doesn't discuss real GDP growth rates under the period in question?"
1,Shameful Rivisionism,"With it's clear partisan slant, and disdain for facts this book is clearly revisionism by a group of people that after all this time are still trying to rewrite history.Cherry picking facts makes this book a embarrassment to the name Historian."
2,Fuel for the neocons,"Nothing draws buzzing, heartless neocons like a book ripping a liberal leader. Jim Powell has done an admirable job of research - but he has seemingly ignored any information that contradicts his predetermined premise: FDR was a bumbling socialist who wanted to suppress the American people. Reviewers like Michael Gordon and Weston Kathman are much worse than Powell. Like President Bush, they seem determined to depict the most successful government program in our country's history as an enormous failure hurtling toward bankruptcy. These are the kind of people that see compassion and communal goodwill as character flaws. I only wish FDR were here to address their petulant whining."
5,Obama is doing the same thing................,"We see the horror that Progressives have done, and now are doing again, this is a book that maps it out.....how the so called good intentions which are being done by Obama are really prolonging the recession and making it deeper. It shows the arrogance of Obama thinking that he knows best for Americans and should be making our choices. It shows that Big Gov't takes away our freedoms and retards our ability to grow as a country."
3,"Lots of info, but biased and boring writing style","There is a lot of valuable information in this book. It is well researched, down to the personality types of the big players in the New Deal. However, it's very biased. And the author does not give much, if any, information on the amount of lobbying that went on by the big business to get those laws passed. However reading this in conjunction with the ""Roosevelt was wonderful"" texts books will give you a clearer picture of how well the New Deal really worked and how it affected later generations.My biggest complaint is the writing style. It's rarely funny and written like a large senior research paper. I found it boring and therefor hard to read. I had to put it down and get a cup of coffee several times to stay awake. If I didn't have to read it for History I would have quit it and never picked it up again."
5,Will history repeat itslf?,"Excellent and, as it turns out, timely review.Many do not realize that their blind devotion to BHO will make FDRs' creation of the welfare state pale in comparison."
1,Incredibly dishonest writer,"What an incredibly dishonest evaluation that unemploymenmt averaged 17%through the New Deal period! It was 25.6% when FDR took office, and 11%in June 1937. Then the Supreme Court ruled 8 of FDR's recovery programsunconstitutional and it began going back up.[...]"
3,trying to decide....,"I haven't actually read this book. I've just been reading the reviews trying to decide if I'd like to read it. It seems that most of those who rated the book highly gave very thoughtful reviews with a lot of examples to substantiate their viewpoints, while the majority of those who didn't like the book just wrote 2 or 3 sentences insulting the author's intelligence and calling him names. I have the impression that they haven't read the book at all and that they just want to discourage people from reading this book, and for that reason I am going to buy this book!"
2,Agenda pushing and altogether not interesting,"First, this book definitely has an agenda to push. It's not balanced look at the New Deal, the people behind it and what it did do right. It's an attack on FDR. Political, self-serving books that pose as history lessons are bad to begin with.But that aside, I jsut found this book to not be alltogether that well written. It went on and on at times, citing endless research, but never striving to drive the point home. Instead it wanted to point out problems in the New Deal using numbers and statistics that have been debated over and over."
5,Were Stalin and FDR twins?,"After reading this book and many Russian history books, I found so many parallels to the actions of Stalin. The command economy, determing the level of production, confiscation of personal property,etc. The only difference is the 20 Million starved, but FDR tried."
1,Rubbish,"This book is revisionist nonsense. If you want a treatment of the New Deal, warts and all, but done by a competent historian, check out Leuchtenburg, Badger, McElvaine, Bernstein, etc."
1,Garbage,"This is the type of garbage which the propagandists from the right use to brainwash the willing. As this current president attempts to dismantle Social Security, his henchmen strive to discredit the Roosevelt legacy. That legacy was and is remarkable although most of it took place in the first 100 days. The reactionaries in the Senate essentially limited what he could accomplish. Without Roosevelt we would be a nation of serfs. Without Roosevlet we would probably have had revolution."
3,"Yes, millionaires HATED the new deal....",".. then and now, so what is new and radical about this interpretation by one of their paid spokespeople? Perhaps they should be grateful that said ""commienizm"" kept the real thing from erupting here and for the most part kept their fortunes safe from rampaging mobs."
3,tds-321,Well written & characters reeked of the Starkweather murders!! KePT my interest throughout.RECOMEND FOR ALL WHO LOVE CRIME NOVELS.
2,got bored,I did not finish this story. It took a lot of pushing to get half way through it and then I just put it down.
4,Gritty Gripping tale based on a true story,"Not Coming Home to You is a white knuckle serial killer tale based on the true story of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. That it is even loosely based on a true story is what makes this an edgy read. Be warned that there is copious violence and under aged sex in the book but it all adds to the gripping nature of the story. If you like the sickly fascinating world of antisocial serial killers, you will certainly like this quick read."
1,Psycho Novel.........................,This is another psycho novel. I do not care for this type of story.It is well written but not my cup of tea.
1,Way Outdated,The information in the book and software on the CD-ROM is way-outdated. Look for more updated stuff---there are many better ones out there.
3,Devo in Video,"I was hoping for interviews and factoids-when in fact, it was all video. Most of which I had already seen. Kinda disappointed."
4,"Voyager Laserdisc to DVD, Finally!","Finally, DEVOtees need not purchase outdated Laserdisc players and spend $150-200 for the long out-of-print Voyager laserdisc ""The Complete Truth About De-Evolution""! You can have it here for hundreds less on DVD. It may lack the ""R U Experienced?"" video, but I understand they've replaced it with Bruce Conner's early groundbreaking experimental film for ""Mongoloid"" (1977). Buy this DVD, and pick up a copy of the new DEVO book - ""Are We Not Men?..."" by Jade Dellinger and David Giffels (SAF Publishing Ltd., 2003) too! Now it can be told."
2,Warning: Contains some really lousy videos,"OK, buy it if you love Devo. It's the only thing on DVD. But only if you LOOOVE Devo will you be happy. There are some good tunes form the 70s and early 80s, but we have to be subjected to the painfully bad Donut & Rod Stuff, some awful videos like Post-Post Modern Man and Disco Dancer, and the unbelieveable Through Being Cool, in which Devo arms really ugly kids with laser guns of some type, and sends them out to destroy people! Nice guys... Get it for the old stuff and the extras. Then dig out that old VHS of The Men Who Make The Music and REALLY have fun remembering the days before they were selling Swiffer mops and beer on TV ads. And Jerry hated the idea of a Devo Doll. Bah!"
1,What crap!,"I was really shocked at how amatuer in concept and production the old Devo videos really are. I can understand this before the group gained commercial success but I can't understand it afterwards. Devo was a group made for visuals. Why Warner Bros. allowed such sub-par (even for 1981) videos to be produced as promotional materials is shocking. Obviously, nobody at the label gave an ounce of attention to Devo's videos. The best produced video Devo ever made was ""Whip It"". It is great as pure cheese. Unfortunately, the rest of Devo's videos are less cheese and more crap. I would only recommend this DVD for DIE-HARD Devo fans. Anyone else will want to use this DVD as a coaster or for re-sale. Seriously."
3,"Yes, but ...","All true, above. This IS a must-have ""document.""However, my copy will not show the extra features. It seems everybody has a problem (somewhere, somehow) with their disc. Way to go, Rhino. You'll be getting my copy back -- and hopefully a BETTER (read: WORKING) version will come back to me. I'm disappointed, hence the three stars.Not in Devo, who, it seems, gets screwed by everybody they try to work with in disseminating their work / message.C'mon. It's the year 2010, fer chrissakes. Can't anyone make a good solid product -- other than the artists themselves?"
1,don't bother if you don't already know what you're doing...,"The book's description on the back cover doesn't even match the content nor does the CD-ROM. It looks and reads like a thrown together blob of stuff ... can someone tell me where to find the durn spreadsheet widget .. its mentioned on the back cover but not in the index, the table of contents nor on the CD-ROM...."
4,Looks Good - Gets a Little Dirty,"I have purchased quite of few of these to hold my DVD collection. They do look better than your normal DVD holders. I would have given 5 stars but when I received them, they were dirty on the sides. And because of the material they are made of, you really can not get it off. On the shelf it does not matter, but that was my only issue wit this produt."
5,EXCELLENT - RUTH WIND HAS DONE IT AGAIN!,"I love anything by Ruth Wind. I cant put her books down,they draw you in and dont let go.This one is no exception! I recommend all her books to you."
3,"Don't try this alone, kids!","While the book includes a set of progressive exercises which are definitely essential, Marchesi's comments on singing technique are limited to only a few pages. When you consider that leading pedagogues such as Richard Miller, Meribeth Bunch and others have devoted volumes to vocal technique, Marchesi's advice is sparse, to say the least. A good book if you are currently working with a teacher or are an advanced singer with solid classical technique looking for some new exercises. Not for the beginner to attempt alone!!!"
5,A must have for those who want to learn bel canto,This book is mostly scales with a few pages of actual vocal technique. This is not for the beginner to use though. The person who uses this book should use it as a supplement to their own vocal studies and have a solid technique for the scales to actually work for you. I'm thorougly enjoying the book thus far.
5,JP2,Excellent Game wish I would have gotten this game back when it first came out; great for anyone who wants to go down memory lane.
3,Good Companion volume to Eisenhower: The President,"I enjoyed this book but it is not as well-referenced as Ambrose's Eisenhower: The President, volumes I and II. I feel it is better as a companion book to those titles.Ambrose has done well to call out specific events during Eisenhower's military service and throughout his presidency; but without understanding a wider view of national and worldwide events, and where these events ""fill the gaps"" within Eisenhower's military and political timelines, it is difficult to put these events, and Ike's decision-making and influence into the correct and meaningful context.I recommend this book for the interested reader/historian, but those looking for casual ""spy stories"" will not be satisfied."
4,polo,Received in timely manner. Which is really great around the holidays. But box had a sticker over most of it and this was a gift wish it had not been on the box.
5,Bad Driver's Handbook,"This is a hilarious book. My two 17-year-old boys laughed out loud reading it, and I think they may have learned something in the process."
5,Very needed read,"A very needed read by most Americans and well wrote if I may say so myself.Robert E. Milliken author of, Stupid In Montana As America"
5,Bravissimo!,"Until seeing the final duet performed by Bocelli & Martinez(?) on PBS recently, I was not familiar with this opera (other than having heard of it). The first question that came to my mind was ""Why is this not performed more often?"". The second one was ""Which DVD should I get?"". I quickly settled on this new release from a 1996 performance and must say that I have just about worn it out! Everything about it is top notch. Of course, the main attraction was Pavarotti; but I have also now discovered Juan Pons and Maria Guleghina, neither of whom I had ever heard of (and WOW!). Do yourself a huge favor and add this to your collection ASAP!"
3,Not up to Maglite Standards,"I would like to start off by saying that I have been a long time supporter of Maglite's and am firm believer that they deliver a high quality product. This light does not live up to those high quality standards. The tolerances are off leaving the reflector head feeling loose and the clicker on off button feels cheap, like it will break sooner than later. Save your money and buy the 3 D -cell LED Maglite. I am disappointed."
3,Falls a bit short of earlier books in series,"The best thing about this latest entry in the 'Booked for Travel' mystery series is the travelogue of New England destinations in autumn. The mystery was less compelling and the plot took longer to develop than in earlier books, and I was disturbed by the dynamic between travel agent Lynne and her spunky 82-year-old mother trying to open a New Hampshire bed and breakfast. Frankly, I found Lynne to be much snottier in this book than in previous entries, particularly toward her mother -- she spends more time being irritated by and avoiding her than trying to be helpful. And the same irritation is clearly passed on to her daughter Jenna, who is a bit of an annoying character. Toll is a good writer, but I thought this was the weakest effort in this series."
4,Mystified by lisagm's review,"I finished ""Fall Into Death"" today and frankly wonder if reviewer lisagm and I read the same book. My impression was that the author described Lynne's mother as a petulant, self-absorbed woman who was peevish and unmindful of others' feelings. I thought Lynne was remarkably patient (not at all snotty) with her mother's petulance. Jenna was portrayed as a caring, thoughtful daughter, and her and Lynne's relationship came across as sweet and loving. It's interesting, I think, that my and lisagm's interpretation is so different. If you're inclined to read this book, please do so and form your own opinions. I live in New Hampshire and can testify that the author perfectly described the scenery and tourist attractions throughout New England."
3,Too much fall; too little death,"I have enjoyed all three of Emily Toll's travel mysteries. However this one could have used much tighter editing. It would have been a much better book with about 35 less pages on travel and about 10 more pages of real mystery. Mom's sudden change in the end was a little unbelievable. It was a bit detious at times, but there was LOTS of local color.I look forward to the next book"
1,Don't buy - drains batteries,"I got this clock for Christmas and put in brand new batteries. A week later the batteries were drained. I tried a new set of batteries - again, maximum life was one week. I didn't use the light except to make sure it worked the rest of the time it sat on the counter in the bathroom. I emailed Brookstone asking if I just had a bad item or if the product was just poorly engineered. Their only response was a canned return policy. And of course I can't return it now since the original packaging is long gone. I will never buy another Brookstone branded product."
1,Boring and lifeless,"I love Gaiam products. I especailly love working out on my balance ball. What I don't like is this video. I can't watch more than 5 minutes of it, it's far too boring and doesn't even catch my interests, let alone keep them. I don't feel worked out after I do suffer through the entire thing. Do yourself a favor, use the money you were going to spend on this video and buy the Balance Ball for Beginners. It's slighty more interesting and you will feel like you've worked out the next day."
5,Great DVD,"I am very pleased with this DVD. Susan has a very calming quality to her voice, gives just enough instruction without being chatty. I have been using the DVD less than a month and am already seeing and feeling results. The moves are easy enough as not to be intimidating but challenging enough that I have to work. All moves are doable -except for the ""teaser"", but can definitely feel that I have worked my core muscles."
2,A little to boring for me!,"I have used other body ball dvd's and this one is really to boring compared to all of them. If you give it time, the workouts do test you a little bit, but thats if you dont fall asleep first! But if your the calm type that dosent like to much of action in a workout then get this dvd. Its soothing for that matter."
1,not a good workout,It's an old lady sitting and talking. You could do this twice a day and never get results.
4,Balance Ball for Weight Loss,"I love this CD. I like Susan's style of teaching, the music is relaxing and the exercises are not hard to master. It's a combination of Yoga and Pilates moves. I'm looking forward to getting more of her exercise ball DVD's."
3,Not a rigorous workout,"I am not certain this is rigorous enough for me. It is very slowly paced but thorough. I would recommend it as a great workout for someone new to exercise, recovering from an injury, or even seniors. It is an excellent video, focused on proper technique and flow. Its just not a great workout for someone that is on a rigorous workout plan, unless you are using this as a recovery day workout. It certainly wont provide a lot of weight loss benefits for someone who works out at a moderate to high intensity level."
2,Boring,"I bought this because I'm a big fan of Weill's Three Penny Opera and wanted to get a sense of what his other works were like. I've listened to Weill's symphonies several times now, and I can't help but conclude that they are uninspired and unfocused. I just don't think he was cut out to compose works in the traditional classical genres. Lady in the Dark at least has some good tunes that are well orchestrated."
3,weilling away hours to sweet sounds,"the symphonies are comprised of themes from other weill works such as 'seven deadly sins' and 'rise and fall of the city of mahagonny' and weill has turned his themes out to symphony legth admirably.the interpretation by martin alsop and the bso, however, leaves something to be desired. it's very much by the book and lacking in texture and dynamic.i'm sure that there is a better performance out there in the world, maybe even one conducted by a contemporary of weill's like maurice abravanel(sp?). that okay; i needed to start this collection weill's orchestral stuffs somewhere."
2,Get the TDK - better price better quality,"Memorex Jewel case arrived with many cases broken, the TKD is has probably thicker and more duarable"
3,Acceptable,"Those that were not cracked or broken when they arrived work just fine. They hold the CD or DVD firmly and the jewel case closes and stays closed. The only problem is that 6 of the 100 were broken during either packaging or shipping. A six percent breakage rate is not good, but I can live with it as being acceptable (until I find a brand that ships better next time)."
5,spark plug,"service was quick fast and easy plugs were just as described,new unopened original package. this is great srevice with a smile"
3,ITS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR SMALL PLASTIC CD CASES,A FEW WERE CRACKED...THATS WHY I DIDNT RATE IT A 4...CANT GET SO EXCITED ID RATE PLASTIC CASES A 5...NO MATTER WHAT.....
5,Great birding project,"This cooperative endeavor between Cornell and Thayer is a winner. Easy access to pictures, maps, data, songs and more with the ability to build your own tests in a number of formats, build and keep custom lists, search by characteristic, find related, compare birds and much more. The user interface is easy to pick up and the value is high - makes books obsolete! It does everthing I want."
4,Birds is wonderfully alive,"Robert Bateman's latest book Birds (foreword by Peter Maththiessen, Pantheon Books, 2002) is a selection of birds he has painted near his home and around the world. For followers of Bateman, this is not a collection of paintings seen in previous books - most of the nearly 200 paintings were painted in the last few years. They include pencil and watercolour wash sketches to full canvas paintings. Characteristic of Bateman's work, the birds in Birds are wonderfully alive. His snow goose bursting from a nest exhibits the explosiveness of the event. A blue crane wading in evening light on a languid pond is exquisitely designed. A foreboding assault by giant petrels on a gentoo penguin is portrayed with all its fury and vigor of the moment. Accompanying each painting is a brief text describing Bateman's experiences and some natural history. This book would make a marvelous addition to anyone interested in nature or art."
4,"Nice, but disappointing","Robert Bateman is one of my favorite wildlife artist, and his first two books are absolutely outstanding. But after that, my sense is that the quality of his work has been going down, while the prices of his paintings (and maybe because of this) have been going up. This book is at the very bottom of his (in my opinion) downward trend. A very few of the paintings you will find in this book are great, but most are unimpressive, and some are outright ugly, clearly done in a rush. You will find very few of those beautiful masterpieces in which the nature surrounding the animal is as important as (sometimes more than) the animal itself. This is an OK book, but it's been a great disappointment, especially because I remember the awe that his previous work inspired me. If you really have to purchase ONE recent book on wildlife art my advice is: buy Jonsson's ""Birds and light"", which in my opinion is as outstanding as the earlier Bateman (but his style is completely different)."
4,Typical blah with one exception,"Basically this album is just a compilation of slow relaxing songs, good ones too, but I would recommend an easy download of them... with these VERY notable exeptions, these are remixes for this album.DREAM ON (A remix of Depeche mode, decent, I like it)CLIMBING UP THE WALLS (A remix of Radiohead from OK computer) This remix is INCREDIBLE, and the reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 2 :-) There have been many remixes of this song by several different bands... But it's by far the best of them all. this is the Zero 7/sneaker pimps remix"
3,Not as pictured.,The picture on Amaozon does not match what I received. I ordered this on because it shows the upgraded cover with a handle. What I received cam with the basic cover with no handle. Tooltopia offered to send a call tag and take it back. Should just advertise what they sell.
4,"Very good, excellent acoustic rock, good vocals, harmonies","If you like America, Eagles and Beach Boys, this is true California acoustic rock. Producer is Americas producer and both G. Beckley, and D. Bunnell sing backup vocals as well as J. Foskett (BB and B. Wilson band), T. Schmit, and others. Great acoustic sound, with excellent harmonies. His voice ranges from G. Frey to T. Schmit, so you get the idea this guy sings quite good. You'll love it."
5,"Dinah, young!","The quality of the recording is not the best but it is more than satisfactory for anyone with taste and sense. Here you get a chance to hear one of the finest chanteuse America ever produced. These are the songs from the War years of the late 1940's sung perfectly by a velvet voice, from the sweet brunette gal from Texas. She didn't go blonde until Television!Please, please, PLEASE, do not miss ""Dinah Sings - Previn Plays"" the Best!The arrangements will blow your mind and it's just a piano and a velvet voice.Dinah Sings, Previn Plays"
5,Wow,I use this program at school and I love it! I love playing with the animal and skeleton characters!
5,FANS OF BUNNICULA,ANY FAN OF THE STORY OF BUNNICULA WILL LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS CRAMED WITH EVENTS IN THE STORY OF BUNNICULA! THE WORDS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO SEE AND THE BLOCKS AND SUCH NEEDED FOR THE CROSSWORDS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO WRITE IN! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE FAN OF THE VAMPIRE RABBIT!
1,dont waste your money,This book was a terrible disappointment to me. I really expected more information. Is full of the classes you have to take and some nonpractical info. Give some detailed information about the receiving lines and the placement in the church. But that's (basically) it. A lot of money for so little info...ugh!
3,"Checklists and Lists, Lists, Lists....","It's good if you are in need of some checklists. I found it as a helpful yet not essential tool when starting in the business. I really did like the example charts of the locations. All in all it's a nice little extra book of checklists. For me, I like to have as much information as possible so the checklists in this book were a good resource. However, like I said previously not essential."
4,Wedding Directing: How to be a professional Wedding Director,I find this book to be very informative for beginning directors. I am a Wedding Planning instructor in the local community college and require this book as a text for the wedding directing class. I use this text along with FAB JOB Wedding Consultant and Start your own Wedding Consultant Business By E. Sandlin.A must have for a Wedding Directing Carreer library.
3,Incredibly Weird,"You ever look back on the things you were exposed to as a child--the things you just smiled and nodded at because there were LOTS of things you didn't understand, so so what if this didn't make sense either?--and realized, ""No, wait, what the actual @#$%?"" For me, Captain Silver is one of those things."
