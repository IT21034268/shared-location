5,Great movie !,"Contrary to the views of critics, I found this to be a great movie, with humor, sadness and a little violence. Very enjoyable, and yet disturbing,."
3,A pretty good character study,"The main thing I like about this picture is the lead actress, Chloe. She is extremely talented and really up and coming. I think, without her, this movie wouldn't be all that good. I do think it's worth seeing at least once."
3,Good acting by the Ladys but thin plot at times.,THe Lady's of the Show did a good job and the plot of the naive girl facing a brutal world was enjoyable however the story overall hit some slow points.
3,"Great performances, weak script.","I was mesmerized by this movie--all the lead characters were interesting and well executed by the actors. Then it was over and I started to think about it...and that was the problem. It's possible that everything makes sense or fits together well in the book, but it did not in this script. Or maybe they cut out ten minutes or something that really should have stayed. I know that some official reviews panned it as 'pervy' or exploiting Moretz or just in general being inappropriate, I did not feel that way. Young girls do get involved with boys who are trouble, they do experiment with what they can do with their sexuality, and they do then sometimes get taken advantage of in a way they did not plan. Again, I think people would have gotten over their uncomfortable feeling watching this if it had more clearly gone somewhere, if all the details holding together the creepy story line had worked. Great characters, though."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","Plot needed some help throughout. I was mainly curious to see Chloe Moretz. The movie and Chloe were were just ok, although I was expecting more of a dark cult flick like ""Let Me In"" that starred Chloe, and that I loved."
3,"OK film, but not great","Thick in Drama, low in plot.Maybe you have to be a mid westerner to get it. I found it mostly disturbing. I was hoping for more of a girl finds her inner kick-ass and comes out shooting."
5,"Ron's ""Hick"" review","As a coming of age/you-can-go-home-again movie, it rates pretty highly with me.Not Chloe Moretz' best effort, but a credible acting job for her."
2,Ultimately Empty,"They picked a terrific actress to play a drifting womanish child, but a terrible actor for the nerdy outlaw. The story fancies itself ""Nebraska gothic"" but never delivers much interest externally or internally. The characters simply are never given much to say or do. It needed a great script doctor to throw in some symbolic details."
2,HICK,"The beginning of the movie was shot in and around my grandfather's home. It was nice to see how the filmaker portrayed the house. I could see many parts of the house that had stayed the same. When the young girl left her home after her mother abandoned her, the storyline went down hill from there. There are sexual and abusive parts in the film that were mishandled. The only good part of the film was when the young girl used art to tell her story."
1,PATHETIC,"Chlo Grace Moretz is unconvincing and painful to watch in this insipid, vapid film that fails to even provide a modicum of pathos to the hopeful viewer"
2,Won't help,"Even thou I'm a professional Interior Decorator, this book doesn't give me much info I don't already know, also the colour samples are missing the manufacturer names and numbers to be found in stores. Yet the credits do mention which companies were used.Everyday home decorator won't find any help from this one.Two stars for the pretty pictures."
1,Overly complex to use,"Save your money and buy the Color Bible. While this does have some historical references, unless you are doing a period home, do you care? I re-read the ""how to use this book"" 5 times. Couldn't find the numeric references to the palettes (""on palette 17.....etc""). Asked a few friends to help cause I was obviously missing something.Not worth the work. Buy a color wheel and a painters fan deck instead."
1,Very disappointed,"Very diappointing for purpose of home decor color inspiration; color quality pale, boring, nothing very interesting. Not the book for me."
5,A top pick for any lending library strong in home and garden guides.,"Kevin McCloud is an authority on residential architecture and design, and his personal choice of the best colors to use in every type of home makes choosing a snap in CHOOSING COLORS, which includes over 700 color swatches and tips for home decor ranging from historical to modern. From early period colors to modern earth tones and mixes, there are plenty of outstanding examples perfect for selecting the right color shade and combination, making this a top pick for any lending library strong in home and garden guides."
5,Incredible,An especially useful book. The author references paint colors by company and color number so you can look up Exactly the color he is discussing. This is important because ink colors in published books are not the same as a color on a color chip (which is not the same as the actual paint). Truly useful explanations of color temperature and characteristics. The index wasn't edited properly; two beautiful chapters are not annotated. Other than this--it's miles above most color books.
4,latin techno,"i do very much enjoy spainsh techno, eventhough i don""t understand the words yet. but for party, hell yes, good music. i am tring to find DJ DERO from volume 1-3, and rest of single (if there is any)"
1,A Pain in the Patoot!,"Bought this scale to use in my coffeeshop less than a year ago. When the batteries are fresh, it does a satisfactory job. However, the two lithium batteries fade very quickly (I've replaced mine five or six times at over $8.00 each time)- and as the batteries fade, the scale becomes worthless. Weights change on their own and the digital display goes haywire. I am shopping for a new scale."
2,Missing Whitfield,I agree with the previous reviewer's remarks. Even more disappointing is the fact that there is no sermon by George Whitfield included in this book despite his name being the second listed on the cover.
5,Works great!,This is a great product. We have used it a couple of times now and it has been very consistent. I'm sure we will have many more uses of it.
3,"everything is good, except that rice sticks to it..","everything is good, except that rice sticks to it.. otherwise no complains..it cooks faster as well.. Sticking makes it difficult to clean it.."
2,It's not non-stick rice cooker,"We received it on Monday, and first time use it on Friday, it was non-stick when I use mop and water clean the inner pot.We use it again on Sunday in the church, we cooked 25 cups rice and it stick on the bottom, very hard to clean it up.We have two 30 cups rice cookers using over 10 years without this issue.Also the lip is very sharp, you have to very careful.We are not happy for this product. We will try to find other one."
2,Stick,"Well, not a good product no matter what we do the rice still getting stick to the bottom of the cooker, we try different brands of rice and still not working. We are totally disappointed with the cooker."
5,Damm fine rice cooker. Best value ever!,Wash the rice real well 3 times and it won't stick to the pot. I can clean it in five minutes if you soak it in hot soapy water first. 40 minutes and poof the best rice ever! 20 cooking and 20 steaming. D. :)
2,Probably won't play any better than the 512MB,Please see my review of the 512MB version. Not recommended unless the price drops a lot more.
3,King of Boogie,"The introduction on the album sleeve by Carlos Santanasays it all. This may not be his best of the best, but, anyguitarist looking for some good licks, this album jams.Recomended for sure."
2,Hard to swallow,Nice to read but the final product will taste really bad. All the reciepts look good on paper but when recreated are just terrible. nothing but complaints. Maybe Mr. Flowers should stick to growing tips.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book, like many others pertaining to this subject matter on the market today, is outdated. I have purchased quite a few books written by various authors on this particular subject matter and have come to the conclusion that if you want current, VALID, information it is best to check the publication date prior to purchasing.As a rule of thumb, if the book was published prior to 2006, don't waste your time and money. As always, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few and very far between."
2,Slots too narrow for regular wine glasses,The openings are way too narrow for regular wine glasses. It was more like a champagne glass width which is not what I ordered. I was able to return the items but was out the shipping which wasn't cheap.
1,Don't waste your time or money,The bulk of this book contains facts about the physical process of menopause that can easily be found elsewhere. The advice to men dealing with a menopausal spouse is miniscule and simplistic. If you're looking for an enlightening book for your husband this is not it.
1,Cheap junk,This adapter broke (mechanically) as soon as I plugged it into the wall. You're better off getting something else. I am very unhappy with this product.
1,Horrible Product,This unit broke as soon as I tried plugging it in. I opened it up and the piece that holds the retracting prongs in place had snapped and now whenever I go to plug it in the prongs simply push into the unit and lose contact with other pieces in side. I might try using some super glue or I might just search for a better product.Do not buy this item if you want guaranteed quality!
3,gone the way of most sequels...,"I am a recent reader of Goudge, and I thoroughly enjoyed Garden of Lies. Her characters and plot were woven into a wonderful story of family and betrayal. However, after only 2-3 chapters of Thorns of Truth, I felt that Goudge had let me down, mainly by not really offering anything ""new."" I can understand a need to fill a new reader in on the story up to this point, but she did this throughout the entire novel, which I found to be very distracting. Her original characters could have stood alone in this book had she dealt with their lives differently. I had hoped for more interaction between the sisters and the mother but it seemed as if even Goudge was afraid of the confrontation! If you have not read any Goudge novels before, you'll enoy this one. If you have read Garden of Lies, then be prepared for a bit of a letdown."
3,Disappointing,"I always grab Goudge's books and read them cover-to-cover. However, I felt this one did not measure up to her previous novels."
4,Thorns of Truth,This book answered many of the questions that you had after reading Garden of Lies. It is a must if you read the first book. I couldn't put it down. You can't be helped but to be drawn in by the characters. Great read.
3,readable,"I selected this book specifically to ""get to the end of the story"" that started with ""Garden of Lies"". It is imperative that one should read that before starting ""Thorns of Truth"". While ""T o T"" was a good read, it didn't hold my interest as much as the first book, and I thought the ending was a bit weak. Too many details were left up in the air."
2,What happened?,"I loved Garden of Secrets, it had an interesting story and pulled me in so I was excited to find out that there was a sequel. I was eager to read the continuation of the story but I am pretty disappointed now. The story doesn't really measure up to the first book. I expected for the information in the first book to be there and come up sometimes but this book just rehashed the past events repeatedly. Rachel did this slightly but Rose just kept whining about the past and didn't really do anything. The story of Iris and Drew could have been engaging but it fell flat. I couldn't really read into their romance and I felt it was more about how she was a burden on him. Sylvie, Brian and Nikos were kind of pushed to the side. The book's plot could have been better but it just boring and overly sentimental. I usually love Goudge's books but this one wasn't up to her usual standards."
1,Disappointing after the prequel,"I thoroughly enjoyed Garden of Lies but found this sequel boring. Several reviewers below expressed my feelings very well... too much rehash and reminiscing about past history... overly redundant... I kept reading (more like skimming), hoping for some progression in the story, only to find this continued throughout the book. Just when something was about to happen, the character went into memory mode. Sylvie faded into the background and her daughters are now just older whiners. Drew, Iris and Mandy were central characters but there wasn't enough background about their lives to give the reader a reason to care about them. When I'm enjoying a book, I don't want it to end; sorry to say this was not one of them."
2,HARD TO FIGURE OUT,"I read this book from start to finish. Some parts are hard to figure out because of the switching of the babies, and I didn't care for the ending. I thought that this book was dragged out in parts. Wouldn't recommend it."
3,Old Tin Roof,"Do you miss either of the bands BUFFALO TOM or FUZZY? Then you will be insanely happy to hear this records. Hilken Mancini was the only good thing about the band Fuzzy (which probably about 19 people ever heard). It's nice to hear her sing again. It's also nice to hear the voice of Buffalo Tom, Chris Colbourn, singing again. The songs mostly sound like later Buffalo Tom ballads with boy-girl vocals. Unfortunately, there really aren't more than a couple really good songs. You will definately want to get this if you are a Buffalo Tom fan because it's probably the closest you will ever get to hearing some new material."
5,Rag fans will love this!,"If you are a fan of ragtime music, you will love this CD. Mark Reichle is a masterful performer of the music of Scott Joplin."
5,Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works Volume ONe 1896-1902,I simply love this album. Am anxiously awaiting for Mark to finish his album series. He plays Joplin as he should by played. I find this album great background and it is playing on my computer almost constantly.
2,misleading,"Although I agree with the other reviewers that the performances respect Scott Joplin's intent, they unfortunately lack a great deal in phrasing, rhythm and sense of harmonic progression. Right-hand passagework often takes just a little more time to execute than the left-hand accompaniment permits, creating awkward-sounding moments, particularly at cadences. The accompaniment, while accurate and full-sounding, lacks harmonic direction to help shape phrases. The result is too often reminiscent of a strait-jacketed calliope with an erratic small gear a bit out of sync. I was also disappointed at the total absence of liner notes, hoping to learn more about Joplin and his marvelous output. I purchased this recording on the strength of the previous eight reviews -- now I'm wondering whether they were written by friends and family of Mark Reichle, or perhaps even by him!"
4,A better edition?,"This movie is beautiful, but if you care about video quality and the readability of subtitles, you might want to look instead for the 2004 ""DTS Version"" from Mei Ah Entertainment."
2,Interesting non-martial arts movie by Tsui Hark,"I rented this movie expecting a martial arts show, instead, I got a fairy tale/legend. Tsui Hark, as usual, does a great job at making the movie beautiful and unique. But the english tranlation leaves the movie to be very confusing. I did not understand most of what was going on!! To make things worse, the way the subtitles are inserted, you can't read most of it at all.There is no martial arts in this movie, other than that, it was an interesting show."
2,Not one of Tsui Hark's best,This movie had potential. Great acting and good cinematography. But it is seriously weakened by the poorly executed special effects. Tsui Hark is a special effects master. So it is quite disappointing to see him make such a sloppy movie. Maggie Cheung shines as usual.
1,Perhaps not the worst movie ever made...,"But without doubt the worst movie I've ever spent money on. The traidtional Chinese story of love and redemption is simply used as a background for third-rate wired-assisted jumps, silly props and make-ups, and juvenile come-ons and titillations. UGH!Is this what people really like to watch?I wish there's a 'No Star' rating - that's what this thing deserves!"
1,I was very disappointed with this CD and threw it in the trash.,I have never before felt strongly enough to review ANYTHING online but I was very disappointed with this CD and threw it in the trash. I expected the soundtrack with the songs I loved as a kid from the motion picture and think I got the underlying musical score. Perhaps I did not pay close enough attention but I feel this album was deceptively labelled and marketed.
3,OLIVER TWIST ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUND TRACK,iT WAS AN OLDER VERIONS THAT i THOUGHT. i WANTED A MORE RECENT ONE. CAN i RETURN IT??I DID come fast and was a good price.but not what I thought it was-i haven't opened the cd
2,Anyone else catch the Godfather references?,"The soundtrack is OK, but the latter half of the new Oliver Twist film uses a theme (Wanted: Bill Sykes and a Fierce Dog) that's extremely reminiscent (to put it mildly) of a major Godfather theme. I mean, to the point that I found it extremely distracting in the film. It's the same three note riff that's so important to some dramatic scenes in Coppola's film."
4,It's good,"African singer-songwriter Baaba Maal has created, on this cd, music with melodic lines ranging from very mellow to more fun, with vocals that are often plaintive but sometimes also very catchy. There's always a lot going on in this music. It's good."
4,Good music,"I used a song from Baaba Maal for my presentation on Senegal. I find the voice a bit shrill but with instrumentals, it's melodic and interesting."
5,Classic African music,"WOW!! This CD is awesome. I am an African and appreciate that Baaba Maal went back to his roots to produce one of the finest records today. It is rear nowadays to find records that will stir emotions and bring tears and joy to our lives. For me, this is one of those rear records that does that. you got to have this CD if you are one of those Acoustic African music fans."
5,Love it,"I love this product. The color is so rich and perfect, no other brand has it. The liner goes on with such ease, only a dab of shadow over it to set it. Does not last entire day but what liner does? Very distressed to not see it on Lancomes direct site any more, so glad to find it here. Have used it the last 20 years, trying less expensive products here and there to great dislike."
2,Too deep and confusing,"I got this book for my step-mom for Christmas thinking she would get a lot out of it. She is a deeply spiritual woman and loves the original book, The Five People You Meet In Heaven.This book isn't extremely long, so I Figured she would have it completed in only a few days. I asked her what she thought of it and said she only got a few pages into it. She says the book is extremely dry and hard to get into.Once she was a little further into the book, she said the concepts described went way over her head and she didn't really understand how it related to the original book.I guess this is more of a textbook type reading and not a novel. Not for someone who wants a quick read while learning something."
1,Proof that some people should NEVER make a movie.,"I won't even bother to discuss the plot because it would be degrading to me as a human being. I'll make this quick. Some of the outrageous characteristics of this ""movie"" (located in Las Vegas) include the following: so-called ""special effects"" that were created by a computer and a blue screen, out of place stock footage provided by ABC News, a car which is driving in a straight line and goes by the Bourbon Street Casino FIVE times(!), a horribly cheesy set that we are supposed to believe is an actual casino, voice dubbing that is so out of sync that I might as well have been watching a kung fu movie...and on and on and on.The silver lining to this cloud is that I did laugh about five or six times while watching ""Cult Of Fury"". It almost could work as a comedy...but not quite. AVOID!!"
3,Unrealized Potential,"Given the popularity of this film in Japan a few years ago, I was expecting something more. In many ways, the plot is derivative of ""In the Realm of the Senses"". While I have very mixed feelings about ""In the Realm of the Senses"", it had much more emotional (some of it negative, but nonetheless meaningful) impact than ""Lost Paradise."" ""Lost Paradise"" suffers from an abundance of mediocre love scenes (when a few genuinely moving ones would be better), a predictable ending, and a huge lack of character development. While the situation presented is a bit controversial due to the nature of Japanese marital laws, the film's failure is its inability to make the audience understand, or care about, the motives of the characters on anything more than a surface level. By the end of the movie, our protagonists are little more than cardboard cutouts going through their predestined motions."
3,Paradise Review,This movie is not for minors. I found this movie okay. I would watch it again and recommend it. The poem the movie was based on was well acted out in the movie. I was not offended by the explicit love scenes.
2,Rather disappointing,"The film is disappointing to me for two reasons. One I was looking for a film that really concentrated on the physical allure of Paris and was disappointed in that it that did not give enough views or shots of the capital. The film hardly merited its title. I think it could have done a better job of integrating the "" feel of Paris"" into the life of the characters. This might not be important to some but I think it is a major flaw. Two the stories were rather disparate and boring. Good acting nonetheless by Juliette Binoche."
3,Just Okay...,"This movie is very French; little resolution tempered with a healthy dose of depression. I purchased it because I love Paris. You do get to see quite a bit of the lovely city-so it has that going for it. Otherwise, this movie is only for die-hard French cinema fans (I enjoyed it, my husband hated it; I speak French, he doesn't)."
2,A so-so movie,"Te movie ""Paris"" has nice takes of the city. But the plot is boring and confussing at times. Too much cursing. It has the interesting point about enjoying every minute of your life. Not what I had expected. I am ready to sell this DVD."
2,A tour of paris in the company of several really nasty people.,I found the characters portrayed in this movies to be so repulsive that I left the movie half-way through the performance.
3,"I liked it, but...","A character study on some not so credible characters. The movie was a look at 4 or 5 characters in Paris that were very loosely connected. Lots of movies asks you to check your skepticism in at the door, and this was no exception. The main two characters were Juliette Binoche playing a divorced single mom who has given up on life and her brother, a former dancer in the Paris vaudeville scene, who has been diagnosed with a terminal heart condition which will require a heart transplant. Neither character was real enough to explore very deeply.Dialogue was good as was the cinematography."
1,HARDCOVER TOO SMALL!,"Buy the bigger softcover version. This is like a pocket version. Remember, you'll be reading this again when you're old and your eyes are shot."
3,for armchair Buddhists (in the Great White West),"Judging from the title, I went into this thinking: This is Hesse's take on the life of Siddhartha Gautama.... You know, the Buddha? Instead we get this thin parallel of Hesse's ""Siddhartha"" rubbed up tangentially against Gautama's life and acts.I suppose that this prejudice tainted my overall read.That said, I did not find Hesse's Siddhartha to be a particularly mature or captivating work. It was well-crafted and (at times) thought-provoking but not particularly imaginative. Between this and Demian, I found myself thinking of Hesse as a watered-down, optimistic Kafka.Oooo.... Now there's an idea. The Buddha in Metamorphosis. (Hey you! Come back here with my idea!)"
5,"Profound, inspiring, life-changing","Siddhartha is Hesse's finest work, followed closely by Narcissus and Goldmund. It's the story of the emergence of the Buddha, written by an incredibly insightful and sensitive author who's clearly walked the spiritual path. It inspired me to write my book, To Bee or Not to Bee, an allegory about the same theme--spiritual awakening. It's now in 11 languages and exploding. Thank you Hermann, you were way ahead of your time.To Bee or Not to Bee: A Book for Beeings Who Feel There's More to Life Than Just Making Honey"
5,Amazing book.,"This is the rarest of books--it's one of the very few you remember and reread and recommend and reread and recommend some more. It makes life seem unknowable and breathtaking, which I guess is about as much as any book can do. Thank god Hesse wrote Steppenwolfe soon after, since the beauty of Siddhartha is almost discouraging. And if you've read Siddhartha (or Steppenwolf), you HAVE to read Journey to the East. But first, READ SIDDHARTHA!!"
4,meh.... it was okay....,"It was okay.... i guess. I'm just not to sure. Its about these kids whos car breaks down so they enter this house and some really weird things happen... including a disenbodied hand and a glass head and a mysterious back room... and some dissappeirenses of a dog, a boy and wheres the owner of the house? Is their anyone in the house with them? Do you want to know? Read a deadly game of magic."
4,A Deadly Game of Magic review,This book was a good read. It was suspenseful and great for people of all ages. Right from the beginning it made you wonder what was going to happen and jumped right into the story. At times it would drag out and get boring but most of the time it was very good. It was well written and gave you good imagery of what was happening.
4,A Deadly Game of Magic,"I liked the book because it was spooky. It is my favorite book by Joan Lowery Nixon. My favorite character was teenashe was funny when she wasn't patient with Bo. I give the book 4 stars, It is a good mystery book."
3,Overall Good,"The book is overall good. The plot keeps you reading, and the characters are mildly realistic. The problem with the book is it lacks key details that can develop the plot and characters on a deeper level. This would make the book excellent. The plot in the beginning is a little confusing. Later in the book you get the answers you seek, but they still are not explained well. The characters have some personality, but I feel them to be lacking besides what is given. There are some questions left unanswered in the end- what happened to the magician's wife and her sister- and you have to conclude the answers yourself. The book never truly tells you. Overall, the book is a good light read. There are one or two curse words in the book which parents should be advised of. I give it 3 stars out of 5."
4,my review,The Deadly game of magic is a alright book it kinda depends on what kinda book you find interasting. If you like wired mistry books then you might like The Deadly game of magic. In this book four teens are driving home after their mime act in a terable rain storm. when Bo's car breaks down one of the others sees a house. Thay go back and all sorts of wird creepy thing start happing to the four kids.
1,This book was horrible.,"I read the book all the way to the end, and I hated it. I liked it at first; it had a good beginning, but it was very repetitive and was left unfinished. It's a good book for grade-school kids, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over the age of 12."
3,The Dark Side,I liked this book because it had a lot of interesting scenes. I gave it a 3 star rating because I thought it had too many things in it that were on the evil side and because I don't believe in magic from the dark world.
1,Sean's review of A Deadly Game of Magic,"This book is terrible! I told my teacher that we shouldn't have read it, because I don't read mystery books. I also don't like to be held in suspense. I wish there were pictures in this book. It would work better as a comic book. I'd give this book 1 star because it was boring."
2,Linda Nelson Stocks Jigsaw Puzzles,"The puzzles are fully interlocking, however, they are printed too dark. That makes it very difficult to work them and therefore aggrevating and not fun."
5,Very good,"Good pill holder holds a bunch of pills in one single compartment, and portable. I recommend these product."
5,Functions and designed well,"This pill organizer works well. We have been using it for a month or so now and it is exactly what we needed. So far, the quality of the little doors seems good. I think it will last. The daily organization for a week is very convenient. I would recommend this product since it is so much more accurate (and quicker) to prepare daily medication for the whole week all at once."
4,Functional but...,quality seems fine and nicely set up but compartments are small. if you need something that will hold a lot of pills per compartment this is not the organizer for you. otherwise it is a nice product.
2,Hard to open,"I bought this for my mother. The compartments are too hard for her to open. Perhaps they would get easier with use, but she couldn't use it long enough to find out. This would be ok for a younger person."
3,Southpaw users,"I have ordered this product from Japan as I used to use similar ones in the past while I was living in New York.I am southpaw and the pill window is not really convenient for southpaw users as you can not open the window from the right-hand side.There are high percentage of southpaw in the States, and I wonder why there is no version to open the window from the right-hand side.Also, I am not happy about the degree of transparency of the case as I cannot clearly see from outside if or not there are tablets inside.As there are no similar products in Japan, it would be a big hit if the manufacturer starts selling the product in Japan, but please forget about saouthpaws as there are much fewer per centage of southpaws in Japan compared with that in the States."
5,Outstanding,They provided outstanding service even when I misunderstood the process. They really care about their customer and their service. I would have no problem ordering from them anytime.
3,Some good info,"Princess Helena was probably the most active of the daughters of Queen Victoria, but little is written about her. This book gives a little insight into her personality and her activities, that are not mentioned in other books. The illustrations are good, but the book is too thin to really give much info."
4,Highly readable,"When I read Marlene Koenig's recommendation (""I recommend you read it"") I bought the book and have enjoyed reading it. There is lots of new material and very little padding. This is not the usual volume stuffed with unnecessary detail. It is more of a story, based on fact, of a princess who was once described as dull and not very good looking but turns out to be handsome, talented, interesting and very popular with the Victorian public. There are also one or two unsolved mysteries. The price of this volume is not exorbitant either! I also ""recommend you read it""."
2,For the Dance/Exercise Impaired,"I had to play this video twice to work up a sweat. If you are new with exercising or have never danced before, this is the video for you. I was hoping to hear great music and learn fun moves. I think this music is the same as Jane Fonda used in her first step videos back in he 80's! Very boring, very staid."
3,My least favorite of all of the DOTI's,"Dance off the Inches 15 Minute Express is 15 minutes long with warmup and cooldown. There is also a bonus 10 minute dance off that includes some of the dance steps from the 15 minute Express segment. The music was Not great...very electronic keyboard-oriented.Lydia Haskell instructs and she does a good job of cueing. I found the actual dance steps themselves to be pretty basic/boring, unfortunately. And I wasn't fond the quick step, which seemed to go on forever. The steps just didn't mesh very well and when I took it from the top, it didn't feel like a very smooth routine.This DOTI (and Calorie Blasting Party) use tempo changes from slow to fast so you can get the moves down. If you like to learn your steps slow and then speed up, I recommend Calorie Blasting with Julie Arney over this one."
5,Ease of a Workout for ANYtime!,I LOVE THIS VIDEO! I was looking for something quick and easy to fit in after my daily walks to add to my fitness/weight reduction routines and this is great. It is short and very easy to do with smooth transitions between the exercises...I can fit it in just about whenever I want or need to do a workout! I love the personality and teaching style that Lydia has...it's like she a friend almost! I love using this as a way to get ahold on my weight issues and drop those pounds...or in other words...dance off the inches!
2,not what I expected,"I was looking for a program that was different from other aerobic workouts and this one sounded fun. However, it turned out to be like most aerobic classes. I was disappointed that it was not really more dance focused. I bought the Quick Fix Cardio Hip-Hop workout video featuring Juliane Arney at the same time I bought Dance Off. The Quick Fix video is fun and is teaching this 40something woman some new moves. Outstanding!"
2,Not for everyone,"The description says it ""takes the work out of workouts"" so I imagined that the dances would be easy to learn. I'd say they aren't. And the music is more like drum machine beats, no fun songs.I bought this with my mom in mind, and it was way too complicated and fast for her. She is 58 years old and is active and excercises, but she doesn't have any dance training in her past. I think this video would be fine for anyone young and coordinated, who is quick on their feet, but it isn't appropriate for others."
2,Not what I expected either,"The instructor is TERRIBLE at instructing you on what to do. You just kinda have to guess based on her movements. Also, there are 3 different speeds you do the dance to, but they move too quickly from 1 to 2 to 3 i still didn't have the foot work correct and they were already moving on. I didn't enjoy it."
2,Music makes or breaks a Dance workout,"The whole point of a dance workout is to have motivating music with it, otherwise what's the point? Because when I see 'dance' in a workout title to me it means non-challenging. However, just to add some fun on days when I need more motivation I like to start with a dancier workout and fun music. This DVD is definitely not it. The moves are so, so and could be modified, but the music is so boring, you don't even want to. I have never done such a short workout and wished it was over half way through. A complete waste of time.Even though I consider myself advanced, I own Tamilee's Motown FitHits DVD and while it is also a non-challenging workout, the music is so much fun that I find ways to modify the moves to make them harder. I have found that there are very few instructors out there that really know how to pick motivating music and it can really make or break a workout."
2,So disappointed,"Alright- these dance moves are ridiculously out of date- I can't feel excited about a ""groovy grapevine."" I think she moved too quickly from one tempo to the other- and all in all, it wasn't very fun.Plus, there's one woman on the video who I swear was not wearing a bra, and it was extremely distracting.I worked out once, and probably won't use this video again... maybe I'll sell it in the marketplace..."
3,Book as described,"Book arrived. Book is as described. The quilt patterns are great. The unfortunate thing is this is a really old book, that does not use the new rottary cutting techniques. So you will need to make adjustments for that. If another one of these books comes up, it would be nice to have that note. Still I am happy with the book."
3,Romance Novels dont belong in DragonLance.,"Unfortunately, Nancy Varian Berberick Ruins a book series about a world that i have come to love. Between this Soap Opera Style Romance of a book, and the ""Inheritance"" book she wrote that completly contradicts the whole Original history of the world. Her writing style is good and she is a good author i just dont feel that her writing belongs in the Fantasy/Sci-fi genre especially not DragonLance. Any dedicated DragonLance reader will find many flaws in this book. Usha was a TRAINED rogue, but now she is the most harmless of women. Very dissapointed."
1,B E W A R E,The charger came not working and package was taped. But they sent 4 batteries to compensate for a non working charger that could not charge the new batteries!!!!!
3,final season,In this Family Affair DVD I am looking for Jodydressed as a Clown.Is it in Class Clown?
5,Great memories from childhood,"Sometimes shows from my childhood don't hold up under adult viewings. Not only does this show hold up, it's better than I remember. Even toward the end here, the writing, acting and direction is superb."
5,Family Affair: the last season,"Season 5, the last season has really good episodes like the one where Buffy nearly gives up Mrs. Beasley and Cissy brings home a pregnant friend. Buffy and Jody had an innocence about them; they were sweet kids. Not like kids are on tv nowadays. It was a different era.I liked that Kathy Garver takes us on a backstage tour of CBS studios where Family Affair was taped and we get to see where the set was. Although Family Affair was filmed in Hollywood, it had that New York City feel to it in the 60's."
4,Card Reader,I have CF II and a MicroSD card. This Card Reader actually has the micro card type and thats why I bought it. Its a great little reader
1,"Did not recognize xD cards, tech support did not reply","When I plug in tis device in a Windows XP Pro SP2 PC, I see new drive letters for some, but not all of the supported formats. In particular, I use both SDHC and xD cards. The Transcend reads the SDHC's fine, but does not recognize the xD card. I e-mailed Transcend tech support and they never replied. I'm returning mine for a replacement."
4,I have no idea if it works...,but I like to think it does. I have it in a small bathroom to prevent mold and spreading germs. Sounds like a quiet fan. Definitely not silent.
5,simple but effective,We love our new little plug in unit. The rooms smells fresh and the only replacement part is the bulb.
5,It actually works!,I've been using this for past 2 years and surprisingly it seems to be eliminating bad smell from room.Just ordered another one of this.
3,Seemed to help but quit working after 3 weeks,"The UV-C light seemed to help reduce our congestion! However, the fan inside this little machine quit working after 3 weeks. We're buying a different UV-C air purifier with a longer UV-C bulb this time around!"
5,great product for small rooms!,I keep this filter going year round in my bathroom and I feel it is very effective. I also keep one by my pets cage areas to make sure that they dont get sick during flu season and I have to say it is very effective for that as well. When my fiance gets sick. me and our pets never catch it and I give credit to my air purifiers for that! I have had them going for a year straight and there still lasting for me!
2,"Meh, Don't Think It's Doing Much","Makes a lot of noise for such a small product. Have it in an area to help with cat-related odors (yikes!), but all it seems to do is produce white noise and a blue night light. Smells do not go away with this unit."
5,Great Product!,"This product is great. I'm pregnant and have been suffering with nausea. All sorts of smells bother me (and my husband isn't effected). Anyway, I got this product to clean the air, and eliminate the smells in the kitchen, bathrooms, and one for the cat litter box. It works great. I feel much better, less nauseous. Smells that I never noticed before pregnancy, now bother me in the house. This product has cleaned the air and I feel so much better because of it."
2,germguardian GG 1000,I read others reviews and I bought it. I use about 3 moths but I still see small insects at my room. Some flies lived a long time. I have to use spray to kill flies. I don't think that this Sanitizer helps me.
2,"Personally, I think its a waste of money...","but thats just me. The unit is too small to do any considerable good. Even if it was biggest and flowed more air, I dont really have much faith in purifiers. The best solution is to open your windows and ventilate your homes with fresh air. There's no replacement for mother nature.I didnt buy the unit, we have it here at the office and I hear it whirring away from 100ft away. Its noisy and does not really eliminate do much of anything. Again, this is just my opinion... :-(Im giving it 2 stars since atleast it looks nice."
5,For office cubicle use.,If I avoid this year's flu season with the shot and the sanitizer -- I will definitely be recommending it to all of my office mates. We ought to be able to wipe out the flu as we know it in the wonderful world of corporate America -- where everything is a group project -- even illness.
2,ehhh,I really can't tell any difference and it is noisy. I bought it for litter box smell. I really cannot tell any difference.
3,good,"the sound of it is too noisy, wakes some people up in middle of the night.but it helps for dust/mold allergies."
5,EPA warns against ozone air purifiers,"After doing some reserch, I purchased this for my son's dorm room. Best part - it really kills odors and I hope germs and it doesn't produce ozone which the EPA is warning about in other air sanitizers. The only con is the noise. My guess is it wouldn't work without the fan so it's just the price you pay for an affordable, safe, sanitizer."
4,Effective little bugger,"I received this plug-in filter as a gift, but having had it for a little over 8 months I would happily buy another. I love the convenience of it. It feels comfortable and well made in the hand, about the width of a pop can. It's pretty tall, though not enough to be overbalanced in a properly fitted outlet; if it does get top-heavy, there's a swivel on the back of the unit that allows it to be turned to the left, right, up or down which can sometimes help stability - or just free up space in the outlet.And of course, it works. I noticed a big improvement in the air quality of my bedroom. Granted, this isn't a very big purifier: it's strong for it's size, but I wouldn't recommend using it for anything larger than your standard bedroom's size. It's also a bit noisy, but it's a steady sound that I found unobtrusive and quickly got used to - very much a white noise."
5,Technology Works,This is the same technology that our hospital and many restaurants use to keep the air clean.We have used these in our baby's room and throughout the house for over a year and we have missed less work as a result of being sick.The noise is minimal and the light is is a pleasant blue.
3,Pretty loud,Bought this for my bedroom and quickly determined this is not something that I could leave on all day and listen to. Too loud in my opinion.
3,Noisy For Its Size,"I use it to get rid of cat litter box smell. It works quite well for such a tiny size. It doesn't get rid of smell instantaneously, of course, but the smell is gone much faster with it.However, it is quite LOUD. The claim of whisper quiet is no where justified -- I can hear it 20 feet away in a separate room with doors open. Furthermore, its UV light bulb, which is 1/3 of the entire unit's price, only lasts about half year if operating continuously, so I usually unplug mine when litter odor isn't strong. Also there is no on/off switch, so only plug/unplug.Nevertheless, if it had been quieter, I would probably leave it on at all times.It only eliminates odors and probably also germs, so don't expect it to filter air all-around -- dusts, mites, and other allergens will still be in the air."
2,Very Noisy,"Unlike the Germ Guardian humidifier which I got at the same time, this thing keeps working after 9 months. I have no idea whether it does its job but it seems to work and it does reduce odor.Only problem is that the fan noise became very noticeable after a couple of months."
3,Unsure,The Germ Guardian GG-1000 UV-C Sanitizer seems to work fine but there's really no way of knowing for sure. Air is not something you can see or measure in any conventional way. This product seems to work like a little fan but omits a very loud sound that can be heard in adjoining rooms. All one can do is have faith that it does what it claims.
1,Sound and fury ...,"... signifying nothing. I can't tell if these things are doing anything. They make a lot of noise, but the room doesn't smell any different with or without them on. I've tested them many days and night in various parts of the house over the last month+ and I just can't establish definitively whether they do anything or not. I should have bought a second Rabbit Air. I think this was probably a total waste of money."
2,Not for cat smell,I have three of these things going in on room and it does no good in keeping the cat urine smell in check. Carpet was removed. I will have the room treated with enzyme after remodeling is done.
4,"Not sure, but not bad.","I can't really come up with anything bad to say about this. It's hard to say if it's actually clearing the air or not, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt; my apartment might be slightly less smelly. I would recommend buying a couple replacement bulbs at the same time. First one lasted maybe a month. Second one about 4 months, on my third one now. A lot of people seem to complain about the noise, but I really don't see much of a problem with the quiet whirring."
2,Who knows?,"This item was recommended to me by my brother-in-law who works in and around hospitals frequently, and is thus frequently sick. The problem is, there really is no objective way to tell if it works or not! I plugged it in by my bed, thinking that at least I would be breathing germ-free air while I slept. Trouble is, if it indeed does what it says it does, I should have placed it by my roommate who was already sick, in order to kill the germs he was breathing out! I ended up catching a bad cold and feeling like I wasted my money. The thing is kinda loud, too, so if you have trouble falling asleep I wouldn't recommend it. At first the ""white noise"" aspect was okay, but after a while it just got irritating. I unplugged it and now it's just collecting dust."
2,probably effective but can only fit US plugs,"It is probably effective, but the down side is I ordered it from Singapore. The product info didn't warn me about the plug - it couldn't fit our wall power points, and even after I used an adaptor, both (I ordered 3 and opened 2) blew and can't be used anymore. Totally a waste of money for me. My advice is if you aren't from the US, forget about ordering this. I should have just spent the money and bought the more expensive ones (but international brands) sold here cos once you add up shipping charges, the costs were almost comparative."
1,Not worth the money,"I have used this product inside my bedroom during the last few months but I have not felt there was any improvement in the air. During the winter months, I generally get sore throat and an occasionally fever. This year, nothing has changed since using this product. This product is as good as the electric pest repellers."
1,Fan quit working after one week,"For the one week it actually worked, it did fine. However, after one week the fan quit working making it totally useless. I returned it and will purchase some other UV-C device but definitely not a Germ Guardian."
2,$30 it's ok but more than that?,I do not know if there is any difference after i started using it. It's really loud for such small thing.
2,Short battery life,This scale eats up battery so quickly. The readout isn't very sensitive either. It's not suitable for the people who do baking.
3,"The Savriti legend, through the eyes of the 1960s","I found this book to be strongly influenced by the ideals of the 1960s, sometimes to the point of cliche: the male narrator's travels between India and his home in Berkeley, where he is an instructor, is a telling example. I would have found this book much more useful if the writer could have looked at the world more universally.I also found the end of the book to be almost indecipherable. The narrator's dream state takes over, and then suddenly returns back to earth in the final three pages, leaving me wondering what just happened."
4,Looking for help...,"From the other reviews I would love to purchase this book because I am looking for help dealing with my feelings of sadness. My oldest daughter moved out rather suddenly and although her new living situation is local and quite good, I was totally unprepared for these sad feelings. What I would like to voice is my disgust at the price of the book... $200! When I read the reviews I thought this book may finally be of some help, but I cannot afford, I'm sure like many women, this book as it is listed. Shame on those who price the book so high as to take advantage of people who could use real assistance during a most difficult time."
5,amazing,this sub ROCKS! the lows I get are amazing. I have stuff every where in the house vibrating. Now if I can figure out how to stop it from creeping across the floor....
5,Bass at it's best!,This bass unit rocks the house! You can feel the vibrations and the on screen explosions.I recommend this as a high end Bass Unit.Blessings......AnnleeEnjoy reading all my reviews!!!!
5,Crazy sub.,"This sub is really powerful. wow. Like 500 watts just in the sub. Its also very clear in its bass, not sloppy bass. Really good for dubstep."
4,power ++++++,More than enough power. No wiring and min.instructions with speaker. I tied it in with a Polk SurRound bar on my 70 in.Sony tv. Great item.I use it in a room 18/20 feet with a 17 foot ceiling. i use only about30 % power.
3,If it sounds good; enjoy it!,"I'm not technically sophisticated enough to really critique this powered subwoffer; however, I like deep and distinctive bass sounds and this one provides that. For those people like me - looking for a speaker that sounds good - I would recommend it."
5,Great subwoofer,Bought this after looking at several sites. You cant get a better bargain for a sub woofer. I believe these woofers are no longer in production they have a newer version that are a little bit pricey. So grab it while you can. I am using it in the basement and the furniture's upstairs rumble if I increase the volume on my Onkyo system.
5,Beautiful Sound,"For the price, this is where you want to be.I had a JBL studio series P38II blow out on me, this replaced it. This sub is just as good, for a much lesser price."
5,this sub is BANGIN,"good bang for your money. i am very satisfied with this purchase. i did a lot of research on sub woofers in this price range, and this particular sub has gotten very good reviews (and plenty of them.) this sub will bring your games and movies to life. i also dj small parties at my house, and low end this sub delivers is astonishing. like others have said, it is loud, and it will shake the walls, so expect to get noise complaints if you live in close quarters with neighbors."
4,Awesome bass response from a single sub,"I am a bass fanatic and love this sub. I was worried about getting one sub cause I was replacing a pair of speakers, each having fifteen inch subs. This sounds dang near as good! Very impressed!"
5,Impressive Sub... Especially for this Price!!,"My PSW505 arrived a few days ago and I couldn't be happier with it. The amount of bass this thing puts out is more than enough for 95% of the home theater setups people have. My system is considerably above average, Yahama 110W x5 receiver, Boston fronts and rears, Polk CS10 center, 2 Polk PSW10s, and now this PSW505. I have the two 10's in the front and the PSW505 in the rear behind the couch. It seriously shakes my stomach. I have the sub crossover at 60hz, the two 10's are 80hz, and the others pick up 80hz and above. I could not be more pleased. It literally shakes the ornaments off my Christmas tree!"
2,good but came broken,"I have no complains about the sound quality of the subwoofer but...I received the product today with the speaker grill cover broken, the manuals were crumpled, looks like they sent to me a returned iten, can't confirm that was but looks like.Another thing is the price, they droped the price on amazon 1 after after I bought, I should return and buy again in another place but I won't do it, I hope amazon can take care of that."
1,LEMON,I have had this Polk 505 Subwoofer less than two years. It has been returned twice because the amp. needed replaced. It has been about 6 months since the last repair and it has failed again. I never had the volume very loud or abused the sub.in any way that would have caused failure so many times. I have already spent enough on shipping to have purchased another one so I cannot recommend buying this product.
4,Good in the short run.,"Bought (2) for my 7.2 system---I feel a '5' should be earned, which, being interpreted means, if I can get 5 yrs. of service out of them, I would definitelygive them a '5'star rating.I'm on Directv and, at first, thought these to be underpowered. However, when Iplayed my son's 'Transformers' DVD on Blueray, THEY CAME ALIVE! WOW!!! Very pleased!"
4,Boom went the Sound!,"The PSW505 is everything they said it was. Great subwoofer for a great price. Amazing sound...tight, deep and full. I will be buying my second one in the next month to complete my 7.2 surround sound system. Having two subs is...amazing.Only one con here...the front grill came broke (like many others have said) I am asking for a replacement, BUT the speaker itself is the BOMB! I only need the grill to keep dust out of the speaker itself.Buy it, you'll love it!!"
4,Very good for the price,I bought the PSW505 because my old highend Velodyne sub amp started making noises and then hum. It was so old no one supported it anymore. I needed a good sub but couldn't afford anything like my highend Velodyne since I am retired so i bought the PSW505. It is not as clean or as attractive as the Velodyne (over $1500) but is a very good sub for the price.
5,Pretty sick,i was looking for the bigest sub out there and this one rattles the neighbors plates and lights...Polk makes a good product.. buy it
4,Great performance for the money!,"I put together a 5.1 PSB speaker system (minus the subwoofer) powered by Marantz and hit my budget. Two weeks later I was ready for a sub and the guy I order all my equipment through went on vacation to Mexico! So I spent the next two days researching the internet and decided to order the Polk sub. I was not disappointed. Sounds very high end. Thick, deep bass with lots of life. It produces like a sub that costs three times as much. I got mine for $200 and it was an absolute compliment to my system. I wouldn't trade my my PSB speakers for anything but the Polk hangs tough. A great buy for anyone!"
5,The Beast!,This sub is a savage beast!!! Teamed with pair of TSi500 fronts and Yamaha RX671 and this bad boy shakes the rafters man... It is bad to the bone - highly recommend.The Amazon price with free prime shipping cannot be beat. Excellent value for the money.
5,"Very, Very Nice Sub","Now this is what a Sub should sound like. Very rich and deep. I have it connected via Monster Sub cable to LFE from my Denon AVR-2309CI. Audessey calibration is simply fantastic. This sub plays music very well. It picks up all the subtle nuances. Pandora Radio sounds just great with by B&W speakers and this Sub. It complements my system perfectly. HT is where it is at for me. This thing will ROCK your house. Explosions literally shake my walls and floor. It never misses a beat. This is why you want a 12"" Sub. Polk does it again. Another fine product. By this before they are all gone as it is a discontinued item. Purchased this through Amazon via OneCall. Can not say enough good things about them. Shipment arrived on time and was double boxed. I was extremely pleased with the overall service and now enjoying this great Sub."
5,This is it!!,This sub is well built. The bass produced by this beast is simply ridiculous. This sub will rattle your windows and upset your neighbors. Just sick!!!
4,Pretty good sub,"This sub is pretty nice, it did improve my previous 2 channel system. My towers go down to 40hz, but just didn't have the oomph I desired at the low end. This sub helps fill in the low end nicely. At first it was very quiet and I was worried I had a defective unit, but I gave it a day and it started to wake up. Still, it is not as loud/powerful as I was expecting based on some of the other reviews. Don't get me wrong, it can get loud if you would like, but some reviews on here led me to have very high expectations. Overall, it is good for the price range.You may also want to check out the BIC F12 if the price of the 505 has gone up or if it is no longer available (I don't think they are actively produced anymore)."
5,Audio Review,simply put .... great value! I put this in the a room that measures 15x15 and it shakes the room. This sub has not let me down at all.Do not waste your money on anything else. this will do everything you want.
2,Didn't work when I received it. But still a good looking sub.,Sub was not working correctly when I received it. Had to turn up volume to 10 to get decent bass. Had to return to seller. Debating on getting this sub again or the DSW600 sub instead. I'm sure both of them are great subs.
5,Boombastik,"BOOM BOOM BOOM. If this is what you""re looking for, don't let this subwoofer pass you bye. The price has dropped, it is now the time to cease the price. This is a mighty beast. you will fell every thumb, with windows shaking and all in between. An execellent product.Polk Audio PSW505 12-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black)"
2,Magnetically Shielded ???,Received today. Manual state that product's not magnetically shielded. Product description clearly said it is in more than one occation. I do not expect this from a product sold by Amazon.com.
5,Great Sub! Delivers quality lows,"I am not one of those Audiophiles so I cant speak to the technical aspects of this sub. It is a powered sub so it should deliver, right? Well, this one will deliver a punch that will render your neighbors sterile!And, with neighbors like mine, I just did a favor for the rest of the world!Buy one today and help stop idiots from reproducing!"
5,A killer subwoofer,"What can I say about this Subwoofer? Great, no it is not great, it is fantastic. It does what it promises and more, it can be connected in many different ways into your system, depending on your preference and the sound is just perfect without any distortion. Thank you Polk Audio."
5,Please read,Love the Subwoofer. Got a great deal. My friend paid 3 times as much for the same sub. He told me to jump on it when he heard the price. The only negative I have is that the 2 bottom speaker post for the cover was broke. I bought it through amazon used items. I super glued the the post back on. There was no other damage with the item. I got this sub at such a steal I can not complain about the broken posts.
5,Quality bass - Tuning system will make ALL the difference,"This subwoofer handles all the music and movies I can throw at it with ease! The only issue was that the front grill was broken like most, which appears to be a packaging flaw, as the outer box was in great shape. Other than that, the sonic quality has been great, and it isn't easy to ""bottom out"" the sub. The bass is intense, kind of made me feel a little childish because unfortunately you can hear it clear as day in my front yard, like when you pull up to a stoplight and that teenager pulls up with his subs banging that you can hear from a few blocks down. Hopefully this thing doesn't get my neighbors calling the police hahaha... Movies are now insane, coming from an old yamaha sub that couldn't hold a candle to this monster. What a bargain price too!!!"
5,"don't be fooled by an ""old technology"" - yes, this unit came out in 2004!!","Although my budget was much higher for a new sub I chose this one for its reviews - it also happened to save me couple hundred. I do not own a monoblock valve vacuum amplifier or Proceed front load CD player with diamond power button. I'm not an audiophile - i just love music and I'm very enthusiastic about good and affordable sound reproduction systems. This unit, this beast is an ""old fart"" on technology market, but do not be fooled by its potential nor ability to deliver a sweet and clean sound throughout your entire living room (I do recommend setting it in large area). Just get it and if you don't like the sound Amazon will take it back no questions asked. It's definitely worth a try"
3,Not bad but a little bulky,"For the price I paid for this subwoofer, I shouldn't complain because it gets the job done. Not the best , but certainly no the worst. The biggest down fall is its bulkiness. I would certainly recommend this to anyone on a tight budget who wants a decent bass."
5,PSW505 Sub.,"I bought one of these as an open box deal about a year ago, I can't understand why anyone would give one of these a low rating. This sub is truly incredible, I don't get to turn it up often because of my family, but when there gone I crank it up and it can be ""felt"" throughout the house and heard for about 1/2 mile down the road. The bass is crisp and clear not muddy as with some of the higher priced ones. this may be in part due to the amp I'm using but regardless, this is a great sub for any price."
5,Kick Ass!,Purchased this sub with high expectations and it delivered the goods! I own a Denon AVR 2113CI Polk RTiA3 and Polk CSiA4. The sub booms like thunder and pumps out kick ass bass! If your sub settings are off you will experience a muddy bass sound so check your settings and adjust properly through your receiver etc. Sub sounds great with movies and music.
4,bang for your buck,"replaced a cheap 8 inch sony sub. and i must tell you for a 189.00 bucks im very happy. it goes very well with my center channel cs-20, and my yamaha reciever. can't wait till i get my rtia3 speakers very happy . ps amazon rocks ........... great service and on time delivery thanks again"
5,Great sub,This is a very nice sub. I'm a musican & want my music to have a nice fat solid sounding bass drum tump @ bass guitar & this sub does it right. You can feel the bass hitting you in the chest. Its GREAT. Its not a boomy bass like you hear in cars.. that sucks & sounds like crap. This is one bad ass sub. Goes great with my RTI 10 tower speakers & rti 6 surrounds. Buy it if you can find it.
5,Awesome Sub,"All I can say is this sub is awesome. More bass than the average listener will need - but it's great to have just in case. I ran speaker cable from the left and right (front) outputs of my receiver to my sub inputs, then from the sub outputs to my satellite left and right speakers for perfect mixing. Best purchase I've made in a while. For the price - this is a steal."
5,"Excellent sound, great price","This sub hits hard for the price. Polk knows what they're doing. Music sounds great, awesome for action movies. There are better subs out on the market, but you would have to pay almost 1,000 dollars. I would highly recommend you save money and purchase this. No regrets."
5,I can hear again!,"I was surprised how much sound I was missing. I hooked up the sub first to my sub output from my Denon 2310 receiver and I thought that was real good. But I decided to try it as Polk suggested in their instructions and that made a much bigger impact on the quality. I am very impressed with the quality of the sound. I tested three movies out with the sub: True Lies (bathroom gunfight scene); Transformers (battle in the streets for the cube); and Pirates of the Carribean - World's End (final battle). The explosions and hits were definitely more vibrant and rick. I also tried a wide range of music (from Wagner to the B52s) and it all sounded better. I opted for the 12"" though I intially was going to get the 10"". But the price dropped significantly on the 12"" and I decided to go with it."
5,Yep... buy it,"All I can say is that all of the positive reviews are true. Unless you just WANT to spend more money on something... I can't think of a reason to not add this to your card right now. It's not wireless and it is big, so I guess those are possible concerns. But for people with normal ears and a normal room and a normal budget, this will MORE than meet your needs... for much less than you'd expect to spend for the quality.I have mine at around 20 percent volume and it's already plenty of power... almost too much at times.I don't know what happy accident has allowed this $400-$500 quality subwoofer to sell for about half that price... but it's wonderful. I try to be a mid-range buyer... I usually try to go for best bang-for-your buck quality. This unquestionably is the best bang-for-your-buck subwoofer I have ever encountered. Seriously. I've been debating getting a decent subwoofer for years. If you're in the market, don't pass this up."
5,Great,"Love the sub, Amazon got it to me before the ETA, love the power that it has, only have it turned half way up and has all the thump that I need. HIGHLY recommend it, Have other Polk speakers, Love Polk"
5,POLK PSW 505,"The PSW505 is an attractive subwoofer with excellent fit and finish. I liked how the Polk performed on most popular music; it easily handled low E on the bass guitar, kick drum, and tom strikes. In my mid-size home theater room, the Polk belted out respectable sound pressure, and breezed through most mid-bass movie passages, only falling short on the very deepest (below 30 Hz) material. Overall though, I think the PSW505 stacks up well against its intended competition at nationwide retail chain stores."
4,Bumps,Sounds like if i was in the movies with these big buck thumps nd bumps wouldnt reccomend for a apt if you want to experience its fill potential
5,Just watched the new bluray of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the PSW505 hooked up,"The opening and closing renditions of the fanfare from Also Sprach Zarathustra were awesome, the rumbling of the spaceship engines went right to the bone. That's a near-perfect movie, and this subwoofer made it materially better.I have the PSW505 connected to my receiver via LFE, which allows for very clean separation of lower frequencies to the subwoofer. Setting the volume at about 40% is ample; this thing can probably dislodge masonry at 100%.It's the largest piece in my stereo setup, make sure you have a place to put it. The power cable popped out once and I thought the automatic power switch might have been malfunctioning, but plugging it back in solved the problem. Did it rumble out its own powerline? It's possible."
4,Great Sub!,"This sub works great. I was using a klipsch audio sub before this. The Polk sub has a much richer and lower sound. I would suggest this to anyone, especially at this great price. The filtered input is great, and works very well with my Yamaha receiver."
3,Bulky,"Its a bit to big for its sound............although it does sound great,I wish they could come up with some Bose standards for the price........."
5,Subwoofer,"This is replacing a JBL 12"" that burned out the power supply circuit board. The JBL performed good until the board burned out, but it happened before it was one and a half years old. The customer reviews on the Polk does not have this complaint, so maybe it will last. It sure sounds good."
2,A Nice but short Journey,"I bought this subwoofer and lasted 2 yeras. whatever you repair is $150 so get and extension warranty or rent it, its cheaper"
4,"loud, clean, articulate","As you can see I did not say low. I owned the polk psw10 for 2 days, that as well sounded ultra good, nice punch and loud for even 50 watts, I returned that sub to best buy and bought this! This arrived in. 2 days, and at first I wasn't impressed sounded like the psw10 I just returned, I bought the psw505 purely because its published frequency response and the fact that it was at least 6db louder, anyway if not placed right in the room you use it in it will have no low end extension, and a lot of port turbulence on any real low bass passages, I play extensive amounts of bass mekanik and the sort and the sub can go cleanly down to about 45hz, any lower it sounds like there's a wind storm in the box, so I placed it correctly and it sounded a lot better, very clean and musical with excellent transient resp, it litteraly is the little bit deeper and louder! Psw 10. For 250 I'm not sure anybody could find a better powered sub, or build one for that matter"
3,Great for the price,"Obviously the people that review this sub haven't listened to a top end sub, that being said for 250.00 you can't beat this one If you want loud deep bass go with this on but keep the idea that this sub is only for home theater not clean enough for music( gets really sloppy)"
5,"Great Sound, Great Bargain.","This unit fills my 18 x 20 room with a powerful robust sound. It is hard to believe that I could get such a fantastic speaker for only $250.00. I had considered getting the 10"" instead of 12"". The 10"" may have worked fine, but I am still glad I spent a little extra for this one. Despite the booming low end nature of the sound, it is clear and never muddy. I like the Auto setting whereby it will turn itself off when it fails to detect a signal after 15 minutes. It is being powered by a Yamaha RX-V473 amplifier from Best Buy (575 Watts). Great bargain!"
5,Best subwoofer for the price anywhere,"The Polk 505 has a tight, clean bass presence that adds richness to soundtracks and movies.As long as you don't push it too hard.So if you want to add rich bass and LFE for viewing pleasure, this is the best $189 you will ever spend.But if you are looking to shake the house with intense infrasound every time something explodes on the screen, you will be disappointed. This is an adult subwoofer.Unlike many low-price powered subs, the 505 amp is well shielded and immune to radio frequency interference from amateur radio transmitters."
2,humming,"Provides great bass, however there is also a persistent humming during low volume or quiet songs that is REALLY annoying! Unfortunately the hum wasn't very noticeable until it was too late to return or get a refund."
4,Good product,"We were looking for a subwoofer when our old one stopped working. Very pleased with the sound, and good value."
5,Good sound,"This replaced a 10"" Polk that I was happy with for movies, but not as happy with it for music. This 12"" polk really sound nice and gives a full bass profile when listening to music. I let the receiver handle what to send to which speakers and the sound is great. Solid construction and good weight.The 12"" box seems a lot larger than the 10"", so make sure you have a good place for it. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Very nice sounding sub,This is the 2nd one of these that I have ordered and the last one I have had for awhile now I just updated toa 2 sub system and kudos to the company because when i opened it the grill was broken at the top so Icontacted Polk Audio and the sent me out a new grill and I didn't have to wait too long for it. I actually read a few subparreviews on this product but I have 2 and this one especially was probably half the price of the first one which is even better.
5,La voz de una sirena,"Ana siempre ha tenido una voz excepcional, y ahora en solitario nos demuestra su natural soltura en el microfono y como compositora de canciones. Para mi que creci con su voz y las canciones de Mecano, me sigue impresionando oirla cantantando melodias sensuales y llenas de pasion. ""Puntos Cardinales"" la cancion que le da nombre a este album, es genial. Una de esas canciones que podemos cantarle al oido a nuestra pareja. Este CD es genial para una tarde de lluvia pasandosela en casa sumido en la melancolia de un amor que se fue, al escuchar ""Te he querido tanto,"" o en los brazos de una amor actual. Gracias, Ana por mantenernos enganchados a tu vuz. Gracias Rafa, por darme este CD como regalo..."
5,wonderful read!,"i just finished reading this wonderful book and decided to review it. to be honest had i seen it on a shelf somewhere i would never have picked it, it's just not my normal style. but a friend from work loaned it to me and one evening i got bored enough to give it a try. i was immediately hooked! the people were wonderful and the story was breathtaking. my only problem was that it took nick so long to find toss again. other than that it was everything my friend promised it would be. you can be sure that i'll be borrowing books from her more in the future."
5,Inexpensive and perfect card reader,"This is a great device and does exactly what it says - it's very small too, which is nice."
2,not worth my while,"This card reader worked great for a year or two, but then after not using it for a while, I went to use it and it no longer worked."
5,Well WORTH the Wait!!!,"Homicide is perhaps the most intelligent television drama that I can ever recall watching. I'm extremely happy with my new DVD set, finally able to watch the entire series in its proper order. Andre Braugher's performance in Homicide is absolutely incredible, but the other actors hold their own in each well written / well acted episode. I'm already on season 3 and speeding onto 4. I would've paid a lot more than the astonishingly cheap price that Amazon let me have this for."
5,seven seasons for less than the price of two...,"Sweet baby Jesus! 35 DVDs, 122 episodes, plenty of juicy bonus features... it's all seven seasons of Homicide for less than the price of two, all packaged in a super-cool faux filing cabinet. This is one of the most critically acclaimed TV series of all time, and for plenty of good reasons. Warning: You will never want to watch another episode of CSI again. (You can thank me later...)"
2,Disappointed,"I'll get right to the point.No CC. Makes it tough as my hearing is going, and there is a lot of mumbling going on.They didn't even take the time to put the episodes in order.Shame on you A&E; and NBC."
4,Love it,"Loved this series first time round and wondered if it would date. Some parts of it have, but mostly not. Still love it, about 2/3rd through. Highly recommend. Must give it to my son and see if he enjoys it as much as me (he's 22)."
4,GREAT!,"I watched some of this as it was being made! Very enjoyable& glad I have the entire set-& won't have to ""later search!"""
5,Homicide-Life on the Street-DVD Complete Set,Arguably the best police drama ever on TV. Head and shoulders over NYPD Blue and Hill Street. The characters were so well developed and the interaction was superb. Yaphet Koto: they don't come any better. What a boss!!
3,"Great Series, but buy the other version","This is a great landmark series, but buy theHomicide: Life on the Street - The Complete Series (repackaged)version. It has all 35 disks, including the Law and Order cross-over episodes and the movie, brand new, for only $64.99 as of mid March 2010."
5,These shows hold up so well,These shows are as good now as when first released. The writing is fantastic and the acting too. I can not beleive how well these shows stand the test of time. Please take time to enjoy a really good series.
2,PROBLEMATIC FOR ME,"Im sure I would have enjoyed this whole series. Unfortunately, for me, its not going to work. I have a bit of a problem hearing and this DVD collection is NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED. Between the background sounds of the streets and the police station, and the mumbling of some of the cast (especially Melissa Leo) it's just not working for me. I can't even imagine how in this day and age that any DVD would not have closed captioned."
5,There is Homicide in the Wire,"Having coaught the odd episode of Homicide on late night Brisih T.V. I expected a box set of high quality US Drama that would end my pain at the demise of The Wire. What I got was a tour de force of modern television. Intricate plot lines that allow the viewer to reach his or her own conclusions, award winning performances and the opportunity to watch as the production values of the series mature into what was to become The Wire. The packaging was excellent as is the quality of the discs, the extras are infomative and serve to support the series viewing. An added bonus are the track lisitings something perhaps they should have continued with the Wire. I have no desire to burden peole with my views and opinions however I suggest that if your downtime demands to be filled by quality entertainment you could do a lot worse than investing in this beautifully packaged and well stacked box set."
3,Great Series Mishandled,"The production value is better than good, but looking and sounding good is not enough for a true fan. The most important parts that could and should have been a part of this package called a ""Mega set"" were missing: The extras. No information concerning episode back stories, casting, story line decisions, or little tidbits that shaped the series into what it was. One of the best constructed regular TV COP series probably of all time. If what you want is to have the complete series on DVD and the story behind it that made it the best, best keep looking."
2,A great set ...but,"This is a great set to own if you have not already purchased the individual season sets. Like many other people I feel ripped off by A&E because they will not sell the 35th disk seperatley. When A&E re-released their ""Avengers"" mega set there was also a bonus disk but it was also sold seperatley so why was this not done with ""Homicide""? I would gladly pay for the ""bonus"" disk with the ""cross-over"" episodes and the ""Homicide"" TV movie but I will not pay $170 just to get that one disk."
1,repackaged but no subtitles,Other reviewers talk about how this is the best cop show ever.I would love to buy this DVD set (in fact I bought the set when it first came out but had to send it back); there are no captions/no subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.Even the best lipreader cannot lipread the back of someone's head.
5,ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST!,"OK,WHERE DO I START? FIRST OF ALL THE SHOW ITSELF IS FIRST RATE ACROSS THE BOARD-THE WRITING IS INCREDIBLE,THE PRODUCTION,THE DIRECTING,THE CASTING ALL ARE FIRST RATE. THE ACTING IS TOP NOTCH AND THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN EVERY CHARACTER IS INTOXICATING! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO WATCH-COMMERCIAL FREE-EPISODE AFTER EPISODE WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE DVD SET ITSELF. THE PACKAGING IS BEAUTIFUL,EACH SEASON IN ITS OWN SEPERATE CASE. REALLY THIS IS HOW EVERY SHOW SHOULD BE RELEASED-COMPLETE SERIES,TOP QUALITY PRODUCT WITH ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES! THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PURCHASES AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS,EVER! THE FUNNY THING IS THAT I REALLY HAD NEVER WATCHED HOMICIDE BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS SET! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET AND GUARANTEE YOU WILL GET HOURS AND HOURS OF ENJOYMENT! HOMICIDE-IT'S ADDICTING! PEACE..."
1,Disappointed in Amazon & AE,"My complaint regarding this product has nothing to do with the content (which is excellent) nor with the price (a very good value) but with how these DVDs have been released previously. I purchased each DVD starting with season 1/2 for full price as/before released. I own all 7 seasons and also purchased Homicide the Movie. Now, A&E releases all 7 seasons + Homicide the Movie + the Law and Order crossovers in this great packaging for an unbelievably low price. Those of us that purchased as I did cannot buy the Law & Order cross over episodes because they are not offered for sale seperately. I feel cheated. It is also sad that Amazon could not use some of it's buying power or influence..."
5,Worked as expected.,"Box was pretty dinged up, but nails have worked well (in different two guns) so far."
1,Disturbing this got published...,"I've never seen so many grammatical errors in a published book before. Kind of ironic, being that the book is about ghost-writing. It must've been self-published. Skip this one."
1,Can't imagine who...,"I can't imagine who could benefit from this. For those who learn well from print, the book offers literally no explanation to support the multi-media presentation. For those who learn well from multi-media, this CD skips so quickly (in a patronizing tone) over complex material that if you don't already know Java, you ain't gonna learn it here. I found ""Thinking in Java"" to be much, much better."
3,how do you learn?,"Different people learn different ways. Generally, there is visually, audibly and actively. Visual learners learn by seeing examples. Active learners learn by doing lots of action, even if it's walking in place while a teacher is talking.This book is geared toward people who learn by hearing more than anything else. The people on the CD talk and you listen and follow along on screen.I gave this book such a low score because I am very independant from my ears. I learn probably 85% visually, and the talking didn't help me all that much. Other than that, it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone with a good set of ears!"
2,It's Just Ok,"Well I got the CD based on all the positive reviews, but I have to say: none of the songs really stuck with me, and there's a certain unpolished sensation I get whenever I hear this CD. I can't say I have a favorite song, but I'm sure in time Mr. ""Lucky Star"" might become the country-western phenom he so wants to be.Just my .02 cents."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"After Reading and totally enjoying The Song Dog, written in 1991 and found in a thrift store, I ordered all McClure's other books in this series going back to 1971. I just read the first one to come in the mail, Caterpillar Cop, and it was just okay. Written in 1972, Caterpillar Cop is about a young boy who is intent on solving a murder. It gets confusing at times, largely due to South African colloquialisms (I'm from NY) but also due to some confusing writing. The Song Dog was GREAT, very atmospheric, and I'm hoping to like something else by McClure as much."
2,Nothing Much,"The book is, at best, an elementary treatment of a profound subject. Moreover, it is poorly and awkwarly written. Not worth the price!"
1,cotton twine??,"The item that you advertised is not what I received,it is not cotton twine,but instead it is cotton string,like kite string.I'm very disappointed.The picture shown for the item is in fact cotton twine,on a spool,what I received was a ball of kite string."
3,Nice little TV Drama,"For those who enjoyed ""The little Girl who lives down the Lane"" and ""Bad Ronald"", this is another Scott Jacoby film.Herschel Bernardi plays his grandfather, Stephanie Powers the employee from social services who threatens to take Scott Jacoby away from his grandfather. Larry Hagman has also a part in it."
4,Worth reading!,"The book has a few dead spots but Brian Moynahan does a great job of describing the life and times of Rasputin. He capably tells the history surrounding the czarina's close confidante and teases the reader with bits of ""gossip"" (read the book and you'll see!) I found the book to be very thorough and well written. Rasputin is one of the most mysterious characters in the history of the world and this book does him justice. For any person who enjoys reading about mythical figures like Rasputin should pick this book."
4,Brilliant account of that era Russia,"This book is very good because of Moynahan's account of all things happening to and around Rasputin at the time. It is a wonderful story - outrageous and compelling. Moynahan did an excellent job in his portrayal of early 20th century Russia. The vivid accounts of the Romonov family is the true reason the novel commands so much attetion from the reader. At parts it seems to become redundant, possibly because of Rasputin's tireless exploits. This book is a revealing, and fascinating look at Russia during that period. For that reason alone it is well worth the time."
2,Rasputin,"Although this book provided much insight onto the early life and background of Gregory Rasputin, I found it to be generally lacking in historial facts. I felt that Moynahan treated Nicholas and Alexandra with an unfair disdain, and lacked the appropriate documentation to make his arguments stick in this area."
4,Moynahan's time and effort in research pays off nicely,"A shocking tell-all it ain't. But if you're in search of a thorough, complete, and well-written account of Grigory Rasputin, search no further. Moynahan scours the history books, eyewitnesses, records, and sources from all over the pre-Bolshevik times of Russia and the result is an entertaining yet historically-accurate piece."
1,Kitty Kelly Lives!,The reason Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra became a modern classic was because it presented its story through the dispassionate historian's eye. The sensational tone of this book makes one think that 70 years of Soviet disinformation on the Romanovs all found a home in this volume. One would do better to stay with Massie (no lover of the Romanovs) and read books like A Gathered Radiance to get a more nuanced picture.
2,Didn't even finish this one.....,"I was not impressed with this book at all and I'm a avid reader of historical non fiction and fiction. There are waaaayyyy to many (to me and just my opinion) non essential facts and ramblings and the book just goes on and on. The book never 'takes off' to me. This is the first book in a long time that I have just give up on and put down. Read about the first 100 pages and could not get any further. Sadly, this one is going to the a donation to our local library."
4,Good Historical yet sensationalized account of the life of Rasputin,"The author does seem to go off on rather informal (and at times just bizarre) rants on the subject at hand. Though this detracts from the work, Moynahan still does a good job with the historical content. I picked this book up and read it cover to cover is under 2 days.Really the content of this book is what sets it apart from other Rasputin biographies. The author is wordy and it allows the reader to get a sense of who Rasputin was as a man, who he would of been had you met him face-to-face. It does an excellent job in highlighting the life of Russians during the 1890's-1917. A good read that I would recommended personally."
1,amateur sensationalism at its worst,Suzanne Massie hit the nail right on the head. This is cheap and shoddy attempt at historical biography. Many other current books offer a far more accurate and entertaining view of Rasputin.
5,"""Heads Of the Town Up to the Aether"" may be the best SF poem","ever written or collaged or dictated into existence even if the ""imperial city""/ ""civitas dei"" could not recognize itself in these antilyrical and mock Spicerian deformations and post-Beat revelations into the ""afterlife"" ghosts and Logos/lowghosts and proud slums of 1960. If this is not US poetry equal to the severe decreations of Wallace Stevens in ""The Rock,"" then I do not know what poesy is nor SF might be as imagined into a city of imagination, vision, and mongrel community."
5,Perfect!,I needed a good spatula to use with my cast iron skillet and this fits the bill perfectly. This is our most used utensil and I'd like to purchase another soon. The edge is thin and smooth so it's perfect for things like frying an egg. It cleans up well and looks new after months of use. I don't know why you would need anything longer for cooking on the stovetop. This would never work for grilling but is perfect for stovetop cooking.
4,Just short of album of the year,"If you ever get the chance to see this band live, then you must run NEVER walk. Katie Noonan's voice is something to let enter your head and never leave. Quite beautiful, sharp and above all listener friendly (most of the songs are quite catchy - bring on the radio) the only things that probably let Polyserena down are the sometimes wordy and pretentious lyrics and the gimmicky she sings/he sings layout of the tracks. I've heard others who've praised that. I wasn't convinced. Still very good though!"
2,Pretentious 'middle of the road' music - Fauxhemian!,"I simply do not understand why this group is regarded as being so good by some of my compatriots. I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend and I've repeatedly listened to this recording and I remain unmoved. I bet a lot of people have felt the same as me, yet are not willing to admit that this recording is merely sophisticated background music for fear of appearing unhip or unsophisticated! George is 'oh so trendy' and 'hip'!As I said in the title of this review, George make prententious MOR music - sort of Pop-Lounge stuff. It isn't half as creative musically as the artists or their recording company would have us believe and the album is actually a little tedious.If you have the Missy Higgins album, and like it, then George is the next step. If you have George's album, and enjoy it, then Ms H may be worth considering. I have to say that I find both of these albums and artists very tedious and jejune."
1,Don't be sucked in by the singles,"I had high hopes for this album based on the (excellent) singles ""Release"" and ""Special Ones"", but unfortunately the rest of the album didn't even come close to living up to expectations. I found a lot of it sounded a bit too much like Jeff Buckley, and not being a fan of his I just couldn't get into it. The album is also a lot softer than the singles might lead you to believe - most of the other tracks lack the intensity that those two singles have.However there is hope! If (like me) you like those two singles you should check out TripleJ's hottest 100 CDs - ""Release"" is on volume 10, while ""Special Ones"" is included in the ""hottest box"" compilation."
5,Glass-to-Wood Hinges/just the ticket for my conversion,"Being a 76 year old grandmother, I am not exactly a handyman, so it was a little intimidating to try to figure out what sort of hinge I needed to attach a glass door to a converted dining room piece that is now my TV cabinet. As it turned out, I chose the correct hinge and it came in a few days (after months of searching local stores, Home Depot and Lowe's included trying to find a glass-to-wood hinge.) Installing was a snap, and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase, the right piece at the right price."
3,U-BOAT Adventure,"Interesting stories, not terribly well written, often difficult to follow but worth the effort for those interested in the subject."
1,Lose this book beneath the layer,This book is suffering from massive technical and terminological problems. There are simply too many to begin to list them. It's like the Naval Institute Proceedings meets the Ladies' Home Journal...and loses. It's riddled with errors fore and aft. I reached a point of discouragement where I simply couldn't read another word. I give it one star for effort...not a good effort.
3,Superb Rendition of Urban Hell - Unrateable,"This is the blackist film noir I've ever seen - makes Trainspotting seem like Disney's Fantasia by comparison - outdoes Backstreet Jane. Acting, setting, art direction, script, depth of character, universal resonances of youth, etc., all consistently true to a hellish world of fallen angels. I couldn't possibly see it again. The skill of its creators deserves a 5, but... if the goal of art is ""elevare et delectare"" (sp?) this is art gone insane - or, sadly, horrifyingly, a naturalist view of life gone insane.I love Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia... but you couldn't drag me to Equador now. I liked hearing Julio Jaramillo, with perhaps Olimpo Cárdenas in the background, too...But, I would strongly recommend a book, ""Rio Fugitivo"", by Bolivian, Edmundo Paz Soldan. Rio Fugitivo presents some of the same, but with a gentler injection of innocence, introspection and atmosphere of Cochabamba - though not without heartbreak."
5,Taake owns all!!!!!,"This cd is remarkabaly the best to ever come out of Norway. They destroy all. Nattestid was good, but this one is soooooooooo much better HAIL TAAKE!"
1,Not worth it.,Total X-Stream Air Combo SetWe bought this for my son. He used them for about 2 days before they were worthless. One of the guns needs the foam rings to be exact in order for it to work. He needed us to help him load it. The gun with the darts sliced the darts so that you would need to buy replacements if you wanted to use it again. The last gun (the one with the balls) is very hard for him to shoot. I went out and bought him a nerf gun after the holidays. That was worth the money.
5,What is Wrong with Hollywood?,"This was one of the funniest new shows that came out of last year's lackluster season. Sharp, quick-witted one liners and the chemistry between Heaton and Grammar was undeniable. This show was destined to become a comic classic. And then it's cancelled? Are you kidding me? Who do we write to so we can see this show get back on the air? It was GREAT. I mean, it was laugh out loud funny. I don't understand Hollywood and maybe I'm not supposed to, but they let a great one get away. Good job, boneheads. All the stupid reality shows out there up to and including Paris Hilton's idiotic BFF and a show like ""Back to You"" is sent packing? What are you guys smoking out there in LA? Seriously. Bring this show back and prove you got some semblance to taste left."
5,"Fox Sucks, Another Classoc Gone",No reason this show should have been cancelled but if you know Fox then you know to never get attached to a Fox show that isn't animated b/c if it isnt an immediate #1 hit its getting cancelled. So just like Arrested Development and a laundry list of other great shows Fox never gave a chance this gem of a series was shown the door just as it was getting good.
2,Good thing it was free,"I'm a resident of the great City of Pittsburgh, and the results from my unscientific survey found that my fellow residents prefer to see more Fred Willard, more Josh Gad and less Kelsey Grammer. Interestingly, my study also found that nobody in Pittsburgh likes Kelsey Grammer, could this be true for the entire country?Anchorman was a great movie but cannot spin off into a network sitcom, nice try Fox."
1,If this is the best the fall season has to offer....,"I will not even bother to watch television this year. Dumb, campy, humor for the vast majority of the show, then at the end it attempts to tug at your heart-strings with a melancholy Kelsey Grammer lamenting how wonderful his newly found daughter is. Yawn - a big who cares from our house."
3,Enjoyable comedy series,If you were a fan of Frazier then most likely you will enjoy this series. I felt that it should have had a second season.
3,Good enough for a few laughs,The show was funny and entertaining. I didn't want to shut it off like some of the other fall previews on Unbox.I will watch a few more episodes before I make my final judgment but for now I think that it is definitely worth a download.
3,Good value because I bought it used.,"This show is fairly entertaining and was a good value because I bought it used. However, it falls well short of the quality of the writing and the characters in Frasier. If you are a fan of Frasier and are interested in this show to see if Kelsey Grammer can repeat that high quality performance in another sit-com, then prepare to be a little disappointed. The main story line revolves around a love child between two TV anchors. The circumstances that led to the child's conception were rather shallow and is degrading to responsible parents. As long as your expectations aren't too high and you can purchase the Season 1 DVD set for a reasonable price, its worth a look."
2,"No, please, you keep it","Oh, this was so bad - it's yet another in a long line of sitcoms where everyone has a snappy one-liner regardless of whether it does anything for the plot or characterisations. Nothing new, nothing suggesting originality, nothing suggesting you'll be able to tell one episode from another."
2,My expectations were so high for this one,"First, I loved Frasier. And when we saw the previews for this one, we thought 'how could it miss'? I mean, it has Mr. Fred Willard! So what makes this so sad is with all this potential, with the great actors and producers, this one misses the mark. The humor is forced. If you want to see some great comedy with these actors, go back and pick a good season of Frasier. Or Raymond. Or Cheers."
1,Boring!,"The show was boring and there was not chemistry between them and it was not funny at all, I guess no surprise it was cancelled."
1,WHY???,"I never bought this item so why is it appearing on this list, please let me know the answer ok??"
3,I have never seen an Aura,"As a student of Comparative religions and all sorts of what I call MAGICAL beliefs.. I don't know what to think about such claims. But just because I can't see them, doesn't mean they don't exist."
2,would not recommend,"I turned to the recipe for Risotto Verde, and the directions called for ""4 tbs chopped mixed herbs"". I bought this cookbook to learn about which spices/herbs/seasonings to use, not to experiment on myself. Again, Lentil & Rice Casserole calls for ""1 3/4 ounces of green beans"". what dose that mean? i don't own a cooking scale! the pictures are pretty, but it would seem to end there."
1,Dead Sunflowers,"I bought this kit entirely because I thought it would be fun to have some sunflowers to brighten up my bedroom. I wasn't originally interested in the book part, but I did read it because I had it, and it was pretty useless. I planted the sunflowers in the provided ""pot"", and followed all the directions. I watered it regularly and sat it next to the window every day. All the sunflowers died anyways, before flowering. The kit comes with exactly four seeds, and all grew into little seedlings, and then died at about the time that their second set of leaves came out. I'm not sure why, but this kit was definitely a disappointment!"
5,My kids love this!,"My children are 11 and 7 and both love this game. It's not easy to find something they can play together, but this one does the trick. My daughter wants the Disney version and every other version that's available for Christmas. I would highly recommend this game for family play. The plastic frames are a little wobbly, but that does not detract from the overall value. Great game!"
5,Great Game!,"These games are just great! We purchased the set for a Christmas Present for our daughter who has some mild speech, language and comprehension delays. It was recommended by one of her teachers as a tool to help her and its working great! We have found it fun for all age groups in our home. We did notice right off the bat that there only 5 girls in the game although our set does have mixed races. So, if your child picks a girl the game is rather short with only 5 options to choose from, little flaw there. The little flip doors have a tendenacy to come off but its easily fixed. I would recommend this game for any family and for all age groups. And as the parent of a delayed child it has also been a great teaching game."
1,...,"The idea of re-focusing the e-learning exuberance on its real benefits and strengths seems admirable enough. Yet this NINE-PAGE document (three of which are non-content, i.e. a title page, a page about Booz Allen and a page with the addresses of their world wide offices!) might have been better published in Syllabus magazine or some other journal devoted to e-learning. Instead, it offers little that those of us in the business don't know already and falls way short of a comprehensive analysis of this topic. The idea of a downloadable publication appeals to me: it's immediately accessible, printable in parts and shortens the time from authorship to publication. But if this is a model of an emerging e-pub, then count me out. It would have been nice if Amazon would have included the number of pages instead of the file size."
1,Seems more like a ad for Booz Allan,The theme is very important. I spent [money] on a trivial intro to a serious issue. This gives digital publishing a bad name. Perhaps they could publish the background research for their editorial for free somewhere else.
3,introductions to metal,"This is the one song that got me into slipknot. i owe alot to left behind for showing me one of the greatest groups ever. And by that I don't mean slipknot. These songs got me into metal, no matter how much I now despise of nu-metal and how much I listen to black metal and death metal.this is a alright track and it features ok instrumentation saved by the drummer.its less heavy than all of their other songs, expecially the vocals, where corey hardly screams at all. the vocals are ok they're just a bit different than usual.This song is also pretty commercialised because it is repetitive."
4,Not bad,"This unit gives great efects. Good for about 500 sq f dance floor. But to set the controles to the right setings is very hard and very sensitive.2.The lights don't moove with rhythm of music, it has its own preset symple rhythm, but it gets activated by noise/music."
2,Three-Piece with Little Value Combo Pack,"This seemed to be a pretty good deal but before December came, my ear piece stopped working (of course I need a replacement!) The holster's base is held to the top by velcro and everytime you pull it out to answer they separate and you have to put them back together, which can be a nuisance because the base is attached to a very STRONG gripping hook that hooks on your pants really really tightly -it would stay on but the rest of the holster would come off (weak velcro connection). Just look for a better holster design and equipment with a 1-year warranty at least."
2,you get what you pay for!,"All the content was correct, but problems arise with the use you give to the pieces. First, the leather case has plastic attached, but easily brakes. Second, the hands free worked for about 4 incoming calls...after those calls, simply stop working. You can be confident of what the pack has, but all equipment is made in China... so expect to be damaged soon. I liked the cost, but not the quality of the equipment. Saddly, it has no connection problems with the cellphone... only quality is very low. Pay low, get low quality."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Bargain price. Case is good. Charger came apart, broke on second use. Have not used ear-bud yet. I would recommend spending a bit more for a more durable charger."
1,jazzman( oh how look how they always seem to grow),"well recently, it purchased my cd entilted ""all i need"". we heard the first song on apollo and was touched. it was called ""all i need"". he decided to buy the cd for them(nu music). let me sell you song one was beepin, but the restof this terrific cd is not. if you buy this don't tell your friends/ or eminies. it is garbage. why do people want it so bad.(god is rollin in the gravez) i really hate to hear her fat mouth/ it wents good. the hiiden track is ok(delta dawn and where will i have time to break it(in)/ who is jasmyne. can i be here wifey. amen."
3,Not the best,"In this Dear America book, Land of the Buffalo Bones, Polly Rodgers and her family travel from England to Minnesota with hopes of a better life. They are very disappointed. Polly and her family have troubles, with not knowing what to do, or how to live on the land.That being said, this book isn't the best in the series, it simply lacks something, you don't really feel close to the characters, and the overall story is kind of dry. It's not a bad book, there are simply better Dear America books to be read."
3,"Very good, but incomplete.","This book gives an excellent mix of grammar and examples. It introduces just the right amount of grammar in each unit. The written exercises are too few and too simple. The pronunciation on the tapes is clear. Unfortunately the tapes only cover a part of what is in each unit, and there is too much English. I will definitely make good use of this book, but after that I will be looking for a more extensive book with more exercises and better tapes."
3,"Relatively good introduction, but more is needed","The colleague who reviewed this book before me, said that this is the book to start with. I agree, but I would definitely like to add that more is needed if you are heading for the Gaeltacht. The grammar part is not as extensive as it should be, and there are large section of grammar which are not highlighted as they should be even in a beginners book. When you have mastered this one, you should try Mícheál Ó Siadhail's ""Learning Irish"", which makes no concesions to the more or less hypothetical standard language, which is preferred by Diarmuid Ó Sé."
1,What a disappointment,"I have to agree with Camera Nana's review. This camera was purchased as a gift for an eight-year old. What a disappointment. I'm still searching for a good replacement, but this did not work for us from Day One. Kids expect instant gratification from digital cameras (mine all say ""Let me see!"" the minute I take a picture), and this camera does not offer that, does not hold many photos, is moderately complicated to upload to computer. It was a waste of money for us."
1,Not up to standards,I was not happy with the function of the camera. If the battery runs down all photos are lost. My grandson was disapointed that there was no viewing screen. I now have to buy another cameras that has the features he wants. It was a waste of my money.
2,"superman, worst of the bunch","talk about too many cooks spoiling the broth! Everybody is phoning in their parts, even #4 is better then this. No wonder Chris Reeve tried to take over for the next one, but like William Shatner, he was over his head. The DVD arrived on time in NEW or like new condition to add to the wall after one watching. The order of quality: Superman Returns, Sman #1, Sman #2, Sman #4 and, way around the block, Sman#3. Supergirl is in a league all by itself!"
2,not quite the worst,"This film didn't destroy yhte Superman mythos but its overreaching attempts at humor fairly made it a bad thing to be committed to celluloid. I am the Superman fan so it was a big deal for me and it needed to be a little more - lot more - sincere. The villains were comedians, the subplots were less than engaging, in fact the only good thing were the action sequences and Reeves' affable charm as the innocent Clark and the MoS. Pryor should not have mugged so much, the Producers should not have been so desperate to make a few bucks on the franchise that they would neglect their core constituency. I can only hope that the next attempt at Superman will remind us of the 1978 original and not anything after Superman 2..."
2,A MAJOR disappointment!,"After seeing the first two Superman movies (which were both really great), and then watching this one, you'll be surprised at how much the greatness and quality of Superman has dropped. Christopher Reeve does a good job as Superman (as always), but that's the highest point of this movie. Why did they take Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor away and replace him with a pair of mediocre so-called ""villains""? And why, oh why did they focus the movie so much on comedian Richard Pryor, who does such a bad job as a computer whiz? The script is bad (no, terrible), the special effects are bad, and the final battle between Superman and Pryor's Super Computer has ""stupid"" and ""boring"" written all over it! The film relies far too much on comedy relief. Yes, the fantastic Superman theme is there, but who cares?! This is one, put in my Movie Guide terms, big turkey! But if you're a Superman fan, like I am, then you might want to watch it, just because it's Superman and all."
2,Superman III Is a Sad Disappointment,"When I first saw ""Superman III"" as a child, I thought it was cool. I love Superman films and love Richard Pryor. But as I look at it today, I can see that it is an abysmal mess of a movie. From the very beginning, I could see that even the visuals looked bad. Everything looks as if it were shot in soft focus. The plot about a satellite controlling the weather and a computer powering itself is pretty implausible, even for a superhero movie. That kind of story should have been left in a comic book. Also, the special effects are awful. In the third act, where Supe dodges missiles, it's laughable. I don't know what the Salkinds were thinking when they made Supe III. The absence of director Richard Donner is evident. Though, Christopher Reeve is still great as Clark Kent and the Man of Steel."
3,Deluxe Edition?,"I like Superman III because of Christopher Reeve. I think this is his best Superman/Clark Kent performance. Clark going back to Smallville is great. But for a Deluxe Edition DVD the audio sucks. Why couldn't they give this movie 5.1 Surround? There's no bass, and this takes away from a movie watching experience. And with todays technology, they could have erased the flying cable... it's still visable in 3 or four scenes. The DVD extras are great. I give this movie 3 stars because of Christopher Reeve. WB please give this film 5.1 audio and color correction for the cables. It would make the film better."
3,Why?,"From the opening scene, an overbudget homage to slapstick, this one looks as bad as it turned out to be. What would happen if the Man of Steel, through no fault of his own, was thrown into a bad Richard Prior movie. Well, here is the mess that director Richard Lester (think Joel Schumaker and the ""Batman"" movies) made of the ""Superman"" franchise. We get Clark foregoing Lois for Lana Lang. We get Superman as a bum. We get Robert Vaughn skiing on a skyscraper. The only redeeming quality is in the fight between Clark and Superman. Beyond that, you should stay away from this one at all costs. I wasn't lucky enough to have been warned, I saw it on opening day."
2,Stupid Comedy-Even Prior isn't funny. Only one good scene,"The worst of the Supermans. I remember when it was released, the choice of the masses was either Return of the Jedi or Superman III. At first, it came as a tough decision, because both Superman II and Empire surpassed their predecessors. Anyway, I saw both, and when I watched Superaman III, I thought the comedy was tailored for numbskulls. I didn't laugh once. Best scene: the fight between the evil Superman and Clark Kent in the scrapyard. That's it. Improved special effects - notable longer ""Reeve on a wire"" sequences when ""Supe"" takes off and lands. THAT'S IT... I TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS TO SEE JEDI. No competition. Bon Voyage, Superman."
1,Are you people insane?,"This movie was horrific!! Have you seen it? Why would you say it's not THAT bad? It's incredibly silly, the plot is full of holes and it is not entertaining. Superman 1 & 2 were great movies, but this one was garbage....like they tried to turn the franchise into a cheesy comedy that makes no sense. It's garbage. Anyone who says different has an incredibly low standard for their movie watching, and it's people like that who lazy directors and writers create for--a.k.a 50% of the movies that are produced today."
1,Superman III was lame,"Okay how can I put this, this movie sucked big time. For starters why put a comedian (no disrespect to the late Richard Pryor) in an Action/Adventure, Comic book movie; that is like mixing ammonia with bleach with really stinks with a strong foul odor. It also sucked because there was no Lex Luthor, just blands villians like Webster and his girlfriend and sister. Lois Lane was shown only 3% of the time. I should have given this 1/2 a star."
2,Oh No!!! Superman and Clark Kent,"This movie is bad, but there is one redeeming plot line - the internal struggel of Superman with his alter-ego, Clark Kent. The personalities split in a junk yard fight that is truly fun and intriging; however, beyond that - the movie is a waist. Richard Pryor is poorly used and Robert Vaugne is too camp."
2,Really not a good movie,"The first two superman movies tied togeather, this one and the later Superman IV were made to cash in.The comic relief approach is just a little too much, there are so many inconsistancies in time that you have to wonder what the editors were thinking. Looking back on computer technology in 83 and comparing it to now, really makes this movie feel older than even the first two."
4,"Slow, but exciting!!","Superman is back and this time he faces perhaps the most diabolical villain he's ever encountered! Tycoon Ross Webster has found a way to control the weather. To ensure success, Webster uses red kryptonite to make Superman evil.After an exciting battle, Superman returns to normal, only to face a supercomputer with a mind of its own..."
4,Another great Superman flick!!!,I think Richard Pryor was a great addition to the film. I couldn't believe Gene Hackman wasn't in the production. That was a big disappointment.
2,"Metropolis is a stupid place to live, apparently.","The opening sequence of Superman III is a 10 minute bit of slapstick that will make you physically ill. It's very hard to watch. It makes you fear that Superman will finally arrive with a little Chaplin moustache and a cane. Horrid.Also, a question to the late Richard Pryor: Why did you play your role of a guy who realizes a latent talent as a computer whiz as a guy who can barely formulate a thought and speak it as a complete sentence? You were also very hard to watch.Richard Lester, shame on you. What happened to you in the twenty some years between A HARD DAYS NIGHT and this? Why do you hate us so?It goes to show, not everyone can be the Beatles, and not everyone can be Richard Donner."
1,Puh-leeeeeze.,"""I saw Superman III and I thought it was 'SUPER-hilarious!"" Give me a break, people. Instead of buying this, open the window and toss your money out...it can fly, like Superman! Much more entertaining than this dreck. Buy 1 and 2."
2,What Happened?,"After making two very good and very successful Superman movies, you have to wonder what happened with this third installment. First off, Richard Pryor, as great of a comedian he may be, had no business being cast in this movie. One has to wonder whether his actual character had any business being in the movie. And instead of Superman battling Lex Luthor or three renegade Kryptonians, he battles...a super computer?!? Granted, there is a part of this movie in which Superman actually battles himself (or his darker self anyway), that wasn't nearly as climatic as you'd think. Besides Lex Luthor being absent, Lois Lane has all but two scenes in this entire movie, and she's supposed to be the most important person in the Man of Steel's life! This movie was poorly written, very poorly edited, and very very badly directed. Only worth watching this movie? Christopher Reeve, who not only plays Superman again with greatness, but gives Clark Kent his due as well."
2,Overly campy,"Too much camp weighs down this third movie. Christopher Reeves' performance, in combination with some good special effects, helps somewhat. But there are too many moments of slapstick and silliness, not enough moments of awe. Richard Lester's directorial style seemed ill suited for the Superman movie this time out. It was also the first movie which did not feature Mario Puzo's input on the story or script, and his absence is noticable. But for 2 hours of halfway decent entertainment it isn't too bad. Just not anywhere near as good as the first two, but still superior to the next one."
1,Should have never been made - One & a half stars,"Although there was bright promise in the storyline, the inclusion of Pryor, Vaughn and the ""Super"" computer, caused this thing to bomb! They should have stayed with the synthetic kryptonite and actually split Superman into two entities - the scene of Kent battling the ""evil"" Superman whether in his head or in reality is still a mystery. Good ""Superman"" battling ""Evil"" Superman should have been premise enough to hold everyone's interest. Scrap the rest and you might have had a picture equal to the previous films."
1,Cheesy slapstick and absent Lois ruined Superman III,"After the Salkinds (the Superman film's producers) fired Richard Donner (who directed Superman: The Movie and much of Superman II), several people involved in the first two films (including Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) made the world know how angry they were at the producers for Donner's mistreatment. When Superman III came along they couldn't really fire Reeve (the star) so they wrote Kidder out of the story to punish her for mouthing off. Without the Lois Lane/Superman love story, the film had no heart in it at all. Then, director Richard Lester did with Superman III what he really wanted to do with Superman II all along, and that was make a slapstick comedy. This undermined the whole Superman theme and made a joke out of the franchise. The only element in Superman II that didn't work was the slapstick that Lester added to the mix."
3,Not as great as the first two,"Even though I am the greatest Superman fan I had to give this movie 3 stars.Now the Superman movies are slowing down.Although I like movies that make me laugh this movie was going for cheap laughs. Now the Superman movies are turning to something that people say is just for kids.Christopher Reeve and Richard Pryor star in this movie.(I like the movie,but Superman 3 had too much comedy in it.)"
4,I like it!,"I know that many people dislike Superman III. I've heard all of the complaints about this movie, but IMHO it's a GOOD TIME. Superman III and Supergirl (the Director's or International Cut ONLY) have both highly entertained me. SUPE III IS FUN!"
1,Superman as a comedy?,"What does Warner and the Producers of Superman do after two hit movies? They change the tone, make it a comedy, almost entirely get rid of Lois, and add Richard Pryor.What is the outcome? A royal mess!And, just when you think it can't get any worse, they give us Superman 4!so...we have to wait 20-some odd years until we can get the memory of this fiasco out of our minds, and the studio goes through up-teen writers, directors and producers before they finally get Bryan Singer to Produce a watchable Project.Let's hope Warner learned from past mistakes."
3,Where is John Williams when you need him?,This is a very good movie indeed. But it suffered the loss of John Williams music. If he was here this movie would have gone beyond the stars as the previous two. but a good movie indeed.
1,Superman III,"The first two were gems,this one was an atrocity, too comical and a total waste of time, charmless movie, Lester should be embarrassed. Pryor was restrained and out of place in this movie, the star is for Reeve for rolling with the punches regardless."
2,As useful as expired 1983 milk,"The reason I looked back at this was because I grew up with it. I saw it in the theater as a child in 1983. Its interesting to see alot of early 1980's culture and Christopher Reeve is a very good actor to watch regardless of the productions mess. The scene with Clark fighting the evil Superman is worth it, otherwise clear off! Very poorly made! It may have worked then in 1983, but it clearly does not hold up. There is no evidence of director Richard Donner's touches (1 and 2{Donner Cut}). The silly producers that fired and cut off Donner, cut the life off of the Superman series. Why did they think Superman is a comedy? What fools! Seeing part 3 makes you long for 1 & 2(Donner Cut)."
3,This is the review of the third Superman film.,"Sure,it's junk. But it's so downright Saturday mattinayish, it's fun for two hours. The plot is stupid, but it doesnt take itself seriously which makes it work."
2,"""Well, You Know What They Say About Sequels!""","Well, you know what they say about sequels! What I don't understand is how could such a bad sequel as ""Superman III"" follow ""Superman II,"" the best sequel ever?! Christopher Reeve is Superman--and is super as Clark Kent, too--and another good thing about this movie is Annette O'Toole, who looks really good as Clark's Smallville sweetheart Lana Lang, and makes you wonder why Superman ever wasted any time with Lois Lane. But Richard Pryor is silly and not believable as a computer whiz in this movie, and Robert Vaughan as a villain has obviously fallen far from his ""Man From U.N.C.L.E."" days.The story isn't even worth discussing, but the one other impresive feature of this movie is watching Superman fly, which looks even more believable than in the first two Superman movies. And that's all I can say that's good about this movie."
3,"""Superman III: First Attempt At Light-Heartedness""","Although this was really the first film where the Salkinds started to muck around with the legend, I regard it as a fun movie to watch just the same! Of coarse when I was a little kid, I was a bit freaked out by Superman turning into a villain! However, the scene between the bad and good Superman does make the film stand out in my opinion! Christopher Reeve pulled that scene off excellently in this film! The other actors, including Richard Pryor, although not getting the best out of the whole story, were still fun to watch! Not too bad of an attempt to be light-hearted!"
2,Maybe if it flaps its arms it could fly,"This is where Superman went bad. I am a die-hard, Chris Reeve, Superman fan, but this is where it went bad. I liked the movie because it had that LOOK that the first two movies had, and a couple of good scenes. Now I love Richard Pryor and all, but not in Superman, man. And the villian was a joke. Superman flew around the world to turn back time, defeated 3 guys as powerful as him, stopped an earthquake, and now has trouble with a COMPUTER! C'mon, man! NO WAY! The day Superman needs acid to whip a computer is the day Captain America doesn't salute the flag! Yep, this is where it all went bad."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Superman III was a letdown from the prior two Super-movies, but it wasn't a total disappointment. If you somehow ignore the sequences with Robert Vaughn (not a terribly convincing villian) and Richard Pryor (funny, but not appropriate for a Superman movie), the rest makes for a top-notch movie, i.e., Superman rescuing the chemical plant; the almost-love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent; and the ""evil"" and then ""split"" Superman. Reeve once again is top-notch; too bad the whole movie wasn't."
2,"Boring, but slightly redeemed",Everyone knows that this film is boring but it has a few good moments such as the hilarious opening but is really very poor overall. I heavily recommend Superman 2 and the original.
1,Worst Sman film,"C'mon, this film stinks! The cast is boring, and the action scenes are on the brink of getting ridiculous. Watch Superman 2 to see a really good movie, watch Superman to see a great movie, and watch superman 4 to see a good movie."
3,Reeve Shines - Pryor Misfires,"Despite its flaws, ""Superman III"" (1983) succeeds in capturing the comic-book spirit that eluded the previous big-screen adventures. Christopher Reeve delivers another winning performance as the Man of Steel, with Annette O'Toole a definite plus as Lana Lang. Unfortunately, the box-office casting of Richard Pryor was a contrived mistake - little helped by Robert Vaughn's mundane villainy. Though ""Superman III"" suffers from unevenness and overlength, director Richard Lester seems more at home with this particular installment. Certainly better than 1987's disastrous ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."""
4,"Still one of the most entertaining ""Superman"" sequels!","Well, to me, ""Superman III"" is a little bit on the comic side because of Richard Pryor being in it, but that does not make ""Superman III"" a bad movie. In fact, ""Superman III"" is among one of the most entertaining sequels in the whole series compared to the first two, but nothing can beat the first film! Yet, I regret the filmmakers not casting Gene Hackman in this one, but that's all right because Hackman probably needed a break from all of this anyway. It is also exciting to see Christopher Reeve facing off against himself in this film. It's Superman vs. Alter Ego, Clark Kent!! Of course, we did not see more of Margot Kidder in this one because of Annette O'Toole stealing the spotlight, but still, that does not make ""Superman III"" a bad film. This one still has all the action and adds much humor thanks to Richard Pryor. This is a pretty good addition to the ""Superman"" collection, renting it or owning it, it doesn't matter."
3,Super-what?! but not unredeemable.,"Superman III is a horrible movie. Bad on so many levels and especially for making Richard Pryor's character the center of the film. But, and this is a HUGE BUT... this film has one of the best sequnces of all four of the Christopher Reeve films. The exploration of Supes dark half is well worth the DVD price (Almost a movie version of Bizarro, almost). That is, if you're a fan of the original Big Blue. Then again you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't interested in buying the film."
3,Well made installment,"Okay, you hear the people give it a bad rap, that is their opinion. But to most people, this movie is great fun. Some say Pryor's slapstick humor was ill-suited, but didn't(gene)hackman do the same?The story has a nice moving plot,the evil superman part was really well done.The sfx were great, way better than Sprmn 2 witch had crud effects at times.The humor at the begining is funny, but I prefer the t.v vewrsion because it has a new begining sequence ( but they didn't cut out any scenes to do that)Say what you want , but this film is worth seeing"
3,"I miss Donner, I'm sure Reeve did too.","The movie is nothing more than a late night tbs movie you'd watch after Braves baseball with your grandfather. In other words its, not that good. If only they would have further explored the relationship between Clark and Lana, and the Superman vs. Clark Kent story (the superman vs. kent sideshow is actually my most favorite part of all the superman movies, which is prob. why i give it 3 stars. i'd give it 2 1/2 if I could.)"
1,If failure had a name it would be Superman 3,"First off what is the deal with Richard Pryor, anyway. Second it has to be the dumbest ending i've ever seen, with the EVIL COMPUTER and THE CYBORG LADY. What is with that. Finally, the special effects were bad and so was the music."
5,Best Superman movie!,"This is by far my most favorite superman movie. I've been waiting for 16 years for this ""Making of Superman 3"" to go on sale officially. I bought this dvd from amazon as soon as it got out and I don't regret it. The picture Quality of the main film seems better on this deluxe edition and the quality of picture on the documentary is superb. In additional scenes there is actually just one scene involving superman, and all the others revolve around richard pryor. Still for any Superman 3 fan this dvd is obligatory."
3,William Petersen,This movie is very choppy- may different things going on-hard to figure out the point--although William Petersen is as sexy and handsome as on CSI- only younger-- what expression's he has on his beautiful face- can't quite figure out WHY? he never made a BIG film-like Tom Cruise-he's every bit as good- & so georgeous to look at-what a face--YUM-YUM
4,ANYONE can do this plan!,"This is the first diet book that just lays it all out in a very simple to understand format...it's easy, it's inexpensive (very inexpensive) and you lose weight! It's the first plan I have followed and actually not felt compelled to reach for the snicker's bar at 3pm....Anyone can follow this plan...it is well worth the purchase if you are 5-255 pounds overweight...you can do this even if you are most busy as I am...."
2,Another Day Another Dollar,"... The title intrigued me. I figured it was a new spin on low carb diets. I've bought and tried every diet known to man. If you're looking for something new, don't bother. The price is insulting enough for a paperback less than half the size of your standard Harlequin Romance. There are no new ideas here, he touts the Zone Diet, which by the way is a great diet; and gives overall reviews on everybody else's diet. There is essentially no new news regarding ""whites"". I'll save you the money. Whites are potatoes, rice, bread, sugar, flour etc. He says don't eat them after 4pm. The secondary title of the book is ""The 3-Rule Diet."" It revolves aroung what your grandmother told you for years, with a twist; eat 3 meals a day, include protein with every meal and skip the white at night. My opinion is, if you've ever read a diet book or have some general common sense about dieting, save yourself the money. It's a HUGE waste of [money]"
3,No White At Night? What About During The Daytime?,"I'm all for getting people to stop eating white flour, white rice, white sugar and other processed, carbohydrate-laden ""white"" stuff. And Dr. Bill Gavin makes a great case for doing so. But one thing just keeps nagging me as I read through this concept of NO WHITE AT NIGHT...why just at night? What about daytime? Wouldn't it be beneficial to eat no white during the day as well? Maybe it doesn't flow off the tongue as easily saying ""no white during the daytime too"" but maybe ""no white at all"" would suffice?"
2,Stating the Obvious,"I read this book last night and thought it was poorly written and edited. I wondered if he is self-published. He repeated himself over and over again. I thought maybe I was delusional until I went back a few pages or even a few sentences to re-read what I had just read!!! Is the advice good? It is if you want to lose weight, but it isn't if you want to be healthy.... In fairness, he does say to drink tons of water which is a good thing.The purpose of the book was to help people lose weight and if you follow his suggestions, you will lose weight. Calories in and calories out....nothing new about that!!!"
2,There are better books available for new teachers.,"This book has some great ideas for teaching a class room and then it has some outdated material and ideas that should have been edited out of the book years ago. For example, ""textbook recitation is an effective technique for teaching basic information simply because students are often motivated to read and study the assignment in anticipation of being called on to recite the information."" What planet is this author from? There may be one out of a thousand students who would actually read in ""anticipation"" of being called on in class. There are better books available to new teachers like ""Understanding by Design."""
4,I miss sample sales!,"Like most fashionistas, I have a thing for shoes. I wanted a book on the aforementioned subject, and I found Shoes by Paola Buratto Caovilla. Caovilla illustrates the shoes created by great designers -- Manholo Blanik, Gucci, Prada, etc. -- while supplying insightful information on how to design shoes. This is one of the best coffee table books I have ever purchased. Now, if only I could find a sample sale..."
3,"Una Coleccion De ""Lo Mejor"" de Caifanes","Si tienes todos los discos de caifanes , este disco esta de mas, ( aun con las versiones del MTV de Miedo y Avientame ) , si eres un fan ocacional, es tu primer disco de caifanes, esta es la opcion sin dudaAun asi, mejor ahorra y compra los 4 discos ;)"
5,Lo Mejor Del Rock En Español : Caifanes,"Caifanes a.k.a Jaguares, is the best Rock band in all of spanish rock has seen. They are perhaps the best spanish rock band ever topping (in my opinion) Mana and other top Spanish rock band."
3,Promete a futuro.,"No me convence ningún tema, excepto ""afuera"".No compraría este CD, pero me dá la sensación de que este grupo podría llegar a sacar muy buenos temas algún día.Soda Stereo dejó un agujero al disolverse, y si alguien me dijera que otro grupo lo va a llenar en el futuro, éste sería uno de los candidatos."
2,Not as easy as you thought,"Not as plain as you thought, but relatively easy to undrstand compared to other controls textbook."
2,"Great Idea, Lousy execution","I bought this book for a quilt retreat. 20 well-advanced quilters attempted to make the ""Lime Surprise"" quilt. However, for all 20 the center would not lie flat. There is something inherently wrong with this pattern. The wedges of the main star did not maintain a 45 degree angle, it got increasingly smaller, the further from the center. All cuts and all seams were checked and rechecked. It is a faulty pattern. I'm not saying don't buy it but know when you make it you will have to make adjustments."
1,It wasn't solid colors at all.,"This clearly says that it's a variety pack of solid colors, but what I received were borders with leaves, pumpkins, and other designs which I will never use."
5,Very nice activities for english classes,This is a very interesting book that has a lot of activities for english students.It helps to develop vocabulary.It is a very helpful book for english teachers.Basics level.
2,Classroom Activities Book OK if Students Have Language,"The book is ok, for groups to practice with, but not for indivdual students with no English language base."
3,"Good Documentary, but disc quality leaves something to be desired","This is definitely worth buying as it's a great documentary. However I have an issue. The History channel is still behind the times in that this is not anamorphic, it's wide screen letterbox. Also, the MPEG2 video encoding leaves something to be desired as well. In an age where people have 42"" wide screen flat panels, and we're getting amazing Discovery channel/BBC documentaries like 'Planet Earth' which shoot in HD and get put out as proper 16:9 anamorphic DVDs. There can really be no excuse here."
1,Movie based on a hoax,"If this were not presented as a ""true story"", I'd rate it differently. Frank Hopkins, born in the late 1870s - early 1880s (depending on how he felt when he filled out his draft registration cards in 1918 and 1942), was a liar and a fraud. (do a little Internet research to flesh this claim out) This is a classic example of a pre-Internet ""viral rumor"" that was started by his written ""recollections"" and folks wanting to believe a fascinating story. Disney - which was warned in advance regarding this hoax - should be ashamed. Note to Jeff Shannon at Amazon.com - do the above suggested research and consider rethinking your ""based on the real-life"" characterization."
3,"not great, barely good, but not boring","A good looking but strangely blah movie starring ""that guy from Lord of the Rings."" I watched a documentary about the ""true events"" this movie is based on, which in effect proved that all of the things the movie portrays is completely false. So that sort of ruined a lot of the movie, knowing the ""true story"" wasn't one bit true at all. That said, it wasn't TOO boring. I watched it till the end, was glad I did, but then...yeah, you kinda forget about it the next day. I expected more ""wow"" and pizazz."
4,Very good movie!!,I don't typically get into westerns such as this movie. It was very long as well. To my amazement it is a very good movie and glad to have it in my blu ray collection. Picture is very clear just as it should be in blu ray format. The desert scenes are beautiful and sometimes it reminded me of Planet Earth the documentary. The main character does a good job in his role in the movie and none come off hokey which is a plus. Overall the movie has a good story based off a true story which I always seem to appreciate more. Recommended!
5,Hidalgo,"Superb film - a little long for some people (although I liked it long!), but script is great, acting is great, the horse is awesome. As for the supplier, the DVD was shipped very quickly, and arrived in perfect, brand new condition, as promised. I can't say anything better than that!"
5,Hidalgo,"A sweet cowboy story with a typical into the sunset ending, this movie is based on the life of Frank Hopkins, a real live long distance racer from American's past. I reccomend this movie for all those who like to see the underdog compete with the big boys and win one."
4,"Finally, a family film","A modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you, your grandmother or young child. The scenery was magnificent and the story, well, let's just enjoy it for the unoffensive entertainment. You rooted for the good guy, the bad guy got his ""come-uppance"" and no worries about language or nudity. Yes, of course, that is the norm today and you can see it anytime you wish and anyplace you go, so I was so pleased not to wince every five minutes. Go, get your popcorn, curl up on the couch perhaps weep a little weep. and enjoy a rarity today, (at least in my opinion,) a movies that lets you feel good when you're done."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"Viggo Mortenson plays the part of Frank Hopkins, a man who has won many long-distance horse races. In this film, he is challenged to participate in the most challenging race of all, ""The Ocean of Fire"" which is a 3000-mile race across the desert. Mortenson is attached to his horse above all else, and that is demonstrated throughout the movie. His mother is an Indian and from her he inherits his love of the mustang. The other horses in the race are thoroughbred Arabians who have been raised to compete in races such as this one, and their owners scoff at him for entering a wild horse. During the race, Hopkins battles not only the desert but also people around him who attempt to sabatoge the race so that they can win. This movie has some beautiful scenery and some interesting special effects but Mortenson's portrayal of Hopkins is too understated and this movie never really engages the heart or the mind of the viewer."
4,MmMmMmMmMm Hmmmm....,"Hidalgo is simple and entertaining. A monogamous man and horse couple who share an interest in ultra-marathons and claim the title of fastest long distance racers in the world are challenged to prove their metal in an ancient horse race taking place in the middle east. Would have liked it a little bit shorter, but wasn't ever particularly bored.Along with Sahara this is indicative of a promising trend in Hollywood of lighthearted and enjoyable adventure movies, the promising counterpoint to dreck like Troy. This is the sort of thing to rent with pizza on a day off and kill a few hours."
5,You people analyze too much.,"What ever happened to just going to the movie TO WATCH THE MOVIE? Not sit there and pick apart everything thats wrong with it. Just watch it and enjoy it make it worth your money and not so that you regret ever going to see it because it was too ""fake"", it's supposed to be, its hollywood. And yes this movie i thought was a great movie and i'm buying the DVD."
3,NOT bad ..... but not great!,"The script was ok. It could have been a great movie but fell apart after the big horse race started in my opinion. It turned from what could have been an interesting look at how they made it through the desert ordeal, to a cheesy hollywood script that included him rescueing a princess then going on to win the race with the help of his ancestors.... corny! I'd rather take out my Indiana Jones DVDs and watch them instead."
3,Good But Not Great,"Hidalgo was an entertaining movie, but didn't quite make it to great. Clumsy dialogue, and some over done performances make the film a little hard to believe.However, if you like an inspiring film about the underdog, and someone facing their personal issues and coming out on top, this may be for you.Great cinematography, and a good performance by Viggo Mortensen make this film a worthwhile rental."
2,2 stars for Mortenson -3 for all the muslims,sorry but i cant believe that there is so much racism in this movie by a race that is despised by all others!
2,Hidalgo,"Wow I am surprised to see so many great reviews! I thought it was very slow,had too much foreing language without subtitles,and was very long. I wonder if it because it was a rental that it didn't have subtitles for all the foreign language. I finally turned on the subtitle choice and then got things like ""speaking in native language...) I think the previews pretty much show the movie. I was pretty disappointed as I was really looking forward to seeing this movie."
3,Man this could have been good,"Overall Hidalgo ok is a movie but all the way threw it I thought one thing and that ones that there was something missing the movie never grabbed me, or striked me in anyway. I couldn't figer it out at all."
3,Hidalgo,An okay movie. A bit wishy washy. The spiritual aspect was a little silly. The horses were awesome.
3,Average Saturday matinee type.,"Poor Viggo, pigeon-holed already from his tremendous work in the Rings saga tries to infuse some life into this matinee action throwback set in the late 1800's. Part native American Indian he joins a cross country race in the mid-East to win some money to save the mustangs back home. He rides Hidalgo, a wonder horse of course of course. Not nearly as compelling in this role vs Aragorn, the movie never the less keeps one interested to the end. It just seems like an average `big' formulaic movie that Hollywood has been churning out forever; forgotten soon after viewing."
3,So-so action adventure,"Not much about this inspired me. It's slow to get off the ground with background about an Indian massacre, then a Wild West Show, before we get to the point of the film: a horserace in the Middle East somewhere. Granted, you don't see many movies set in Iraq in the late 1800s. But the picture seems strangely inert, the sword fights obviously not real, and the 'romance' with a veiled princess less than hot. The sand traps are cool, though."
5,very entertaining,"Great film that's got a great mix of humor, action, and drama. Not a big Viggo fan or anything (I'll leave that to the ladies)but he was damn superb in this movie."
4,True friendship in a horse!,"I was impressed with this movie, eventhough it was overly predictable. The music is absolutely gorgeous, especially if you are attuned to the Middle-Eastern style, very beautiful. The suspense was there, but not in a white-knuckle sense, kind of refreshing for a change. There was also the ""battle"" for Viggo's attention between the evil American woman and the Sheik's daughter. I really enjoyed the concept of honor that weighted heavily in this film's concept. It kind of reminded me of ""The Last Samurai"", with Tom Cruise.This film runs a bit over 120 minutes, so be prepared...but don't worry, it's worth every minute."
3,Exaggerrated Family-Friendly Epic Seeks No Deeper Meaning,"Just your run of the mill ""based on a true story"" romanticized Hollywood semi-fiction. Vigo Mortensen makes for a convincingly dedicated cowboy in this fish-out-of-water document of an endurance race across the middle east, but can't quite turn the role into anything more substantial than a simple caricature of wild western perseverance. Instead, far too much effort is wasted on the personification of his horse, the titular mustang Hidalgo, who all but opens his mouth and speaks by the time the film is through. Part exaggerated Disney epic and part family-friendly adventure, it's predictable and inoffensive - good for a few breathtaking landscapes and a thick, obvious underlying moral."
4,Indiana Jones meets SeaBiscuit,"This is movie is a combination of Indiana Jones and Seabiscuit. There's lots of action although the beginning drags compared to the later movie.I thought Viggo did a very good job playing Frank T. Hopkins,although it is not as good as his role in the Lord of the Rings. Overall this is a very good movie for people of all ages."
4,Find out about the leading character!,"As many reviews have indicated, this is a good movie but flawed by an excess of Hollywood Hype. Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the reviews tell much of the story of the Spanish Mustang. To find out about these marvelous horses, start with spanishmustang.org. As the title indicates, Hidalgo is the leading character. And the supporting cast of Mortenson and Sharif arent' bad at all. But do see it after you've learned something about the horse."
3,Its all about the horse,"Putting aside the fact that many of the facts concerning Frank Hopkins life are larger than life, Hidalgo isn't bad. But it was really a story about a horse and his rider. The horse really was wonderfully well trained, both on film and, I suspect, in real life. Viggo, especially with a slight 5'oclock shadow, is always a delight to watch, and he gave a wonderful and even believable performance. The desert cinematography was beautiful and the storyline not too dull. However, the main character of Frank struck me as ever so slightly dumb. Yes, he was indeed an honorable man, but did he honestly think that he was just there to `win the race'? Did he not realize the ramifications that accompanied his entry? Especially as things moved along. He just seemed too much of a `country bumpkin'. I enjoyed the movie, mainly because the horse was great, Viggo was nice to watch, but overall, I somehow expected a little more."
3,Watch the pirates.,"This movie was ok, but is too much of everything, not enough of one thing. Like cold mountain(which sucked) it tries to take on too many genres and be the best at all of them but succeds in providing nothing for any genre. This movie has too much unneccasry ""adventure"", all the fighting and rescues and what not take away from the focus of the movie, the race. You about 10 mins of the race and the rest is talking to sheiks and rescuing damsels. The movie would be better if all they did was have 300 hundred guys racing, fighting each other, trying to beat each other, sabatoging their stuff, things like that, have it be a race for their lives and have to survive wild animals (not the fake leopards) and nature and other racers. There is hardly any of that kinda stuff which is what the movie should have, not a bunch of badly choregraphed fights and shootings, and a sandstorm although well done lasts only a few seconds. 5 out of a 10."
4,An entertaining and well acted film,"Hidalgo is a pretty good film, entertaining and visually beautiful. Viggo Mortensen utterly owns this film. Him and that beautiful horse. Its unbelievable the rapport they have in this film. Its very sweet and completely believable. It's not just an actor on a horse. It feels like so much more. And that is what makes this film work. The script is pretty engaging and the acting from the rest of the cast is also very good. I do remember I think it was a tad on the long side, which isn't a big deal really but truthfully, I don't think it needed to be that long. However, since Viggo is in this, it really doesn't matter since his acting is so brilliant and you really can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen. There is a nice amount of action mixed with humour and some tense, almost depressing moments. It really has everything anyone could want in a film."
4,The kind of movie I never get tired of seeing,"My profile. 43 yo (and getting better). No qulaifications as a movie critic whatsoeverThis is one of those adventure movies I just cannot stop seeing... everything is perfect, the production, the choosing of the actors, the action.. and the love between man and horse united in such way that makes you actually hear the horse's thoughts.."
4,A really well done film,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed. This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint. If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it. And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him. He is a very good actor and an underated one at that. So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure. And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!)"
3,Corny,"Where to start, I am not a horse lover, nor am I captive to how handsome a man Viggo is. Therefore, I rented the movie for other reasons, namely to see a good period flick, with good actors, and a good story to tell.That being said, I was disapointed with just about everything this movie had to offer. The actors were so obviously (excepting Viggo who appeared sedated) over the top. I started laughing after the 4th or 5th time the prince would stop and look over his shoulder and gasp in amazement that the ""painted pony"" could keep up. Or, how about the cut away to the leader of the bandits overlooking the race from a cliff and played to dark music as he plotted his dastardly deeds?I am not just picking out a couple of examples, I could go on and on, from the looks on the Calvary officers when he showed up with his last second dispatch to save the mustangs, or to the horrible goodbye scene with Annie from the Wild Bill Cody western show. Just terrible!"
3,"Lots of sound and fury, but the soul was lacking","After watching this film for two hours, I was exhausted, not because it was particularly exciting or exhilarating, but because it seemed to take so much effort to watch. I don't know why. Perhaps it was because the movie was so formulaic, perhaps it was because the pacing was all wrong, I couldn't tell. Hidalgo is an old-fashioned adventure story with an old-fashioned hero and thrills and excitement galore, but somehow it didn't all mesh."
3,montana horse lover,"I probably won't be featured but I'll try, I know about the mustangs and horse racess etc. and the paint horse is beautiful, but I am afraid to watch the movie in fear of him dieing at the end. Can anybody tell me this with out ruining it for some one else?"
5,"Love it, over and over again!","I love historically based stories. This one captures the drama of the movement West in the US. Cinematography was beautiful. The acting was excellent, I lost myself in the story. Viggo Mortensen is my favorite. A true story, this film is one I return to time and time again., All animal lovers will know what I am talking about."
4,Good movie,worth the time to buy and cheaper than renting mostly. It's combo of western and racing with a romatic twist.
5,Best horse movie ever!,Not just about the horse. Human bad guys and rawest nature must be overcome. Wonderful horse. Many interesting characters. Beautiful settings. Amazing ending.
4,Hidalgo,"Very entertaining movie. One of my wife's favorites. Glad to see it became available on blu ray and at such a great price! Worked great, no problems. Came in timely manner."
1,This the biggest load of garbage ever,"This is the biggest load of garbage I have ever seen. This ""system"" is about as effective as fighting a forrest fire with gasoline. The originator and his representitives are borderline insane. They think that lousy boxing skills coupled with a poor understanding of martial arts is a good fighting system. The broken English that they speak is hard to follow and leads to headaches and a general state of confussion. I have spent 17 years deeply involved in the martial arts and this by far is the biggest fraud out there. Dont waste your money."
1,Look elsewhere for paradise,"This book is just awful. Self-published, the text is full of grammatical errors (would someone please explain to the author the correct use of ""lie"" and ""lay""), and exhibits a self-absorbsion that borders on the pathetic. Rarely about the land and people of St. Johns, the author devotes chapters to her cockroach problems in New England (why should we care about bugs in New England?) and to her ""difficult"" decision over whether she should give up two weeks of ""paradise"" in order to give her brother a life-saving kidney. I tossed this one in the trash."
1,Waste Of Money and Time,"This book was a really bad St. John experience. It's poorly written and I was often left wondering if the idea of having somone edit it ever entered the author's head. This is ""stream of conscious writing at its worst. The author is totally self-obsessed, and the reader hardly gets to meet any of the island locals, outside of the people who live within 10 feet of this woman's front door. After reading this thing, I wonder if the locals would secretly like to boot ""non-belongers"" like this back to the states. I left this book at the house we stayed at so no one else would have to plop down cash for it. It's bad."
2,Too much Boston. Not enough St John.,"This book was originally a great idea -- two continental Americans head for the sandy island beaches of paradise. It's unfortunate we have to spend the first half of the book in Boston worrying about money, septic tanks and cockroaches. What I hoped would be a Carribean version of the more jounalistic FOUR SEASONS NORTH (Billie Wright's wonderful book describing her first year living in Alaska) was more like a letter home. I hope the author tries a second book, and I hope it starts with the crunching of their shoes in Carribean sand. I also hope she learns to show us the story rather than tell it."
3,Kind of like school,"This is the kind of book you would read mainly if you have to. It has valuable information about moving to the tropics, which could help if you are planning a similar move. But it is not a book that will sweep you away. Parts of it are a bit slow, but as I said, it includes a lot of information that is very educational to those who are contemplating a similar move. A very good effort by a novice writer."

4,Why did it have to end????,"I really loved Ellen's WHOLE 5 seasons, altho my favorite episodes on th season 5, are the ones where she is dating Laurie. It's a shame the network pulled the plug on the show (and replaced with another Gay show - Will & Grace!!!) when things were starting to get ""good"" between Laurie & Ellen!I had to skip over a few of the episodes since I found them pretty lame (the talk show ones, civil war one, the research - basically all the ""non-Gay"" ones!), and especially the last two of the Hollywood ""tribute"" to Ellen - which were both pretty stupid. Sorry just my two cents!"
4,Episodes out of order!,"I really enjoy this DVD and series, but the episodes are out of order! They do not follow the order in which they were aired on television. This is obvious if you watch them in the order they are on the DVD. Check on IMDb for the correct chronological order and the season will make much more sense!"
5,Beautiful Caldecott-winning pictures,"Every year I tell my students about the Caldecott Award, an annual award given to the illustrator of the best picture book. This was the first Caldecott Award winner in 1923. Then I show them other winners and they get to see the different types of illustrations and learn about those winning illustrators. The stories in this book are from the Bible, but the black and white pictures are beautifully done by Dorothy Lathrop."
2,Great Pictures,"The pictures in this book are excellent quality for adults and some kids. It does NOT keep a child's attention with the King James Version text, and therefore has been a waste of money for me. I think in its day, it was a great book, but since the use of language has changed from King James, kids don't relate to it as well.Still, the pictures are well-done."
5,Sparks Fly,"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE ""SPARKS FLY"". THE SONGS ON THIS C.D. ROCK AND WILL BE WITH US FOR YEARS. GREAT WORK, KORY!!"
4,"Great product, great price!","I have been able to play both games, and both are enjoyable for either a quick game with friends, or long drawn out battle. This combination of games provides plenty to do with family and friends."
3,1 out 0f 3,"very strong scents! one spray is more than enough. might be nice if mixed with another more mellow scent. i like the peony one the best but wish it wasnt so overpowering. i do not like the violet scent and the lily is just OK. not as good as other thierry mugler perfumes, like ALIEN (my favorite) or the original ANGEL."
1,YUK!,When I read the reviews on this perfume I thought I would try it. What a mistake! It is over powering and gives you one heck of a headache. I even tried to give it to my best friend and she said TRASH IT! It really is that bad. I will stick with Burberry.
3,Thierry Mugler fragrances,"Whoah! Sweeeet stuff. Very cloyingly sweet. A good thing if you like very simple, one-note super sweet fragrances for pre-teen girls. Of all the fragrances--- Angel, Violet, Peony and The Lily (which is lily of the valley, not the Oriental Lily or Stargazer Lily)--- the Violet is the most bearable because it evokes Victorian fragrances, grandmother's antique recipe for violet melt-away candies and sugared violets on little tea cakes."
4,Great Reference Work,"For anyone who wants to understand how semiconductor devices work, either alone or in systems. Covers basic theory and use of diodes and transistors; bipolar, MOS, and linear integrated circuits. Written in clear, down-to-earth language. Requires no previous technical background. Ideal for self-study."
2,Ok,The bags are ok but the snaps are cheap. I was hoping for a more durable snap that I have seen with better quality bags.
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"These little pouches are very pretty and well-made. However, they have metal zippers which are not lined on the inside, rendering the pouches unsuitable for storing pearls, which was my intended use. Otherwise, they are nice."
2,MANHATTEN JUNIOR,"Jason Briggs stuttering monotonous delivery of lines gets tiresome. Christina Ricci's flirting lead lady isn't revealed as anything but a superficial portrayal of what amounts to a not very interesting person. Anything else? Yes, Stockard Channing. as the Mom with a nightclub act is a far more involved character and is wasted to a comedic relief position. When Woody Allen isn't on screen as the cynical mentor of comedy writer Briggs, the weak knees of it seem about to bust. Danny DeVito as the kid's dependent agent is also a welcome relief from the dull young cast. I can't help but expect more from Woody Allen."
3,Invest time in this one,"I agree its not Woody's best but fans would do well to invest their time in this one, and invite others to watch it with you, even if they are not familiar with the comic master's work. Highlights:-Woody is not the star, but a much different, more powerful character (who drives a Porsche and vandalises other vehicles!).- It is well structured in its narrative- young stars are fresh- quite funny- would appeal to young and old audiences"
3,Not as good,"Anything else id not as good as Allen's other. The neurotic character is more in Biggs character, than in Allen's. Biggs is like a young Allen, and it's not that great. Besides that the movie is pretty funny, not rolling on the floor funny, but funny."
3,"Not Like His ""Earlier Funnier Movies""!","Woody Allen has never failed to amuse - until now. This story seems like a rehashed Allen film with a new actor portraying the neurotic Woody. Jason Biggs just doesn't fit the part. He's awkward in the wrong way. Ricci survives slightly more, but still has trouble delivering that Woody Allen female lead brashness that is so vital in most of his films. Even the story is hackneyed and there are very few surprises. Devito puts in his usual manic performance and gives a rather funny performance in a restaurant feigning a heart attack, but that's about it. Suddenly, I am finding I don't want his ""earlier, funnier movies"". One can only be sure that his next film has to be better."
3,Worth Seeing If You're A Fan of Allen's Work,This is not one of Woody Allen's best films but he has never made a bad one as far as I am concerned. This is an entertaining film for the true fan. The only real problem with the film is Allen's casting of Jason Biggs in the lead role. He is a terrible actor and a poor youthful substitute to fill Allen's shoes. The saving grace of this film is Christina Ricci. She plays a thoroughly unlikeable character but she plays it with style and range. She also comes off the most attractive I have ever seen her in a film. Danny De Vito does a great job as well. Allen's scenes toward the end are particularly strong. The ending is one of Allen's best. Genuinely touching. I just think that the miscasting of Biggs in the pivotal lead role really hurts the film overall.
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"A parody of Woody Allen with Woody Allen, that wears thin with his first appearance in the film. Stale jokes and irrelevancies that are not worthy of him . . . it seems that he is way, way past his prime, in his acting as well as in his production of this bore. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Ogling Christina,"Woody did the right thing in yielding the romantic lead to an age-appropriate actor, even if the result was less than electric. But I had the feeling that he was seeking some compensation in treating us all to an overly generous visual exploitation of Christina Ricci's very nubile body. Allen's films have always featured sexy women but, heretofore, with subtly and style. It is not that ogling Miss Ricci by any means ruined my day, but it was not the kind of sophisticated fun that I am always hoping for from Woody. In fact, it had a desperate quality to it...the artless addition of something that ~always~ sells. Not a terrible movie, though."
1,Just what I should have seen instead: Anything Else,"Well, I'm here to help you...all of you. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, never watch this movie. Everytime you do, an angel loses her wings in grief and dismay. Plot: inexistant Acting: none Anything else? Yeah, thats what I should have seen. You're welcome.-David"
1,Worse than a middle school play,"I gave this movie an open mind through the end. The story itself is decent, but the acting is terrible. Ricci and Biggs seem uncomfortable and rigid in their interactions and delivery of their lines. Neither one seems to buy into their role or really understand their respective characters. I felt like I was watching a middle school production of West Side Story or something. Other characters, including Ricci's mom and Woody Allen, are solid but just can't make up for the lame performances of the 2 leads."
1,"ANYTHING ELSE? YES, PLEASE!","Jason Biggs plays Woody Allen and Woody Allen plays Woody Allen in ANYTHING ELSE (Universal). That's two too many right there. He directed and wrote this as well. So he must take the blame. Maybe it was all a ruse so he could watch cute Christina Ricci wander around in her underwear. There's a ton of talk in this sad misfire of a film and it finally adds up to nothing. Felt like it was 10 hours long. You have been warned.""Anything else"" is the answer to the question: ""Should I see this one?"""
5,Behavior,"This movie is a favorite of mine. It is very entertaining. It is excellent to see Christina Ricci and Jason Biggs awesomely portray an excellent and entertaining study of human behavior. This is one of my favorite Woody Allen movies, it portrays the cynicism of human behavior with insight and aplomb. Vastly entertaining."
3,Annie Hall revisited,"Remember the last scene in Annie Hall, the one where Alvie sits dejectedly watching a couple of kids run through a rehearsal of a play he wrote about his life and times with Annie? This film feels as if we are watching that play. However, it is worth seeing as last gasp of a marvelous career."
1,Meh.,If it wasn't for Jimmy Fallon this movie would have sucked majorly and I would have not gone to see it. It was SO BORING.-- Heather WWW.LUVTHEFALLON.NET ---> Your #1 Source for Jimmy on the Net!
4,ANOTHER ONE,"I've seen the whole Woody Allen production and, frankly, I'm unable to say that, since MANHATTAN in 1979, one of his movies is a failure. Everyone of them is extremely well written, intense, and I've never looked at my watch while I was watching them. It's incontestable that Woody Allen can't be compared to Steven Spielberg nor Brian De Palma with relation to the mise-en-scene of a movie but, in my opinion, he still belongs to the best American directors of the last thirty years.ANYTHING ELSE is a sweet comedy about a sweet guy who doesn't know how to say no to his relations for fear of hurting them. His psychiatrist won't be of any help at all. Only an old Jewish philosopher, with odd and radical methods, will manage to transform the young man. The dialogues are smart, the actors perfect and the action very funny. In short, ANYTHING ELSE is another little pearl of the aging master.A DVD zone quality."
5,lovely color,"I absolutely love this color. It is very fun and vibrant, but still has a sweet girly feel of the color to it. O.P.I is one of my top brands of nail polish, along with Essie nail color. But the Thrill of Brazil polish actually went on so smoothly, i applied two costs like normal, but I loved that there were no air bumps like some polishes do. Overall I am so happy with this color."
3,OK book,"In this enchanting story, an African-American girl dreams of returning to Africa. She dreams of going into a marketplace, doing African things, and finally, returning to Africa to see her long-ago granddaddy."
5,Interesting New Show,"I love the Big C. It's refreshing with a host of quirky, authentic whining man-children, grizzled neighbors, cancer sniffing dogs and a belligerent obese student. All together a swimmingly good time."
3,Sad that you haven't given up on not trying to prolong your life?,"This may be tinged by my own personal experience of watching a family member waste away from an incurrable terminal illness, but when I first saw this series I took it as a breath of fresh air that the main character wasn't resigning herself to a a slow decent towards death, but was choosing to live her final days to their ""fullest."" That makes the direction the series went towards the end of the season all the more dissapointing. I didn't want to watch Laura Linney clinging on to the last scraps of her life, but ultimately that's the way the show seems to be going so I'm not sure if I'll watch the next season...The DVD set is fine btw, nothing to get excited about there."
5,The Big C: The complete first season,"A wonderful story with great characters. The acting is award worthy. The story moves you along, it doesn't have slow moments that put you to sleep. It's a great story dealing with a difficult subject and it handles it beautifully. I want to watch it again and again."
2,senseless characters,Love Lynley but this show has unlikable characters whose actions are senseless and totally exacerbating and after 4 episodes I could not take anymore. Had high hopes but totally disappointed.
4,Great series,We really like this series. If you haven't seen it yet you need to check it out. The purchase and download went very smooth.
2,Censored & hobbled. Why bother?,"The pilot episode of Showtime's ""The Big C"" as available on Amazon Video on Demand is censored. Curse words are silenced -- at first I thought my audio was dropping out, as this program has a lot of profanity. Who knows what else has been cut from the original broadcast version?Why offer a version of the program that completely undermines its artistic integrity? I will, with 100% certainty, not be buying subsequent episodes via Amazon VOD... so glad they offered this free preview.As to the content of the show, it seemed rather ho-hum (although I love Laura Linney, who deserves a better vehicle). But who can really tell without seeing the real deal?"
2,Unreal and obnoxious,"This is so contrived it's unbelievable that anyone thinks this approaches reality. It is even obnoxious in it's glib put down and stereotyping of the support group. This is for people who have no idea what the reality of cancer and treatment is like. This could have been a great idea to depict someone who has cancer and still lives her life. The writing is the level of a bad sitcom. It surprises me how many people like this.If not for the fine star, Ms Linney, I would give it no stars. My wife and I couldn't watch past the 6th show, and those were unbearable."
4,Quirky Fun,"Come on, people, you are all taking this much too seriously. This show is pure entertainment and the inconsistencies are part of its charm. Linney is superb and the ""one-liners"" hilarious no matter who utters them. Can we not simply watch a show for pure entertainment? Does every little wink, nod, snort and comment have to be over-analyzed? I find this series great fun and eagerly await every episode!"
5,Good show,It's a roller coaster of emotions. I enjoyed watching it. My mother in law cried. And she doesn't die in the first season. So you can look forward to more seasons.
5,great delivery for a great DVD!,"The DVD worked fine and the delivery was easy to track and actually came a day early! I received a follow-up email immediately after requesting feedback and listing their website. Very pleased!I would review the series, but if you're purchasing it you must already know how AMAZING it is! The plot is smart, the dialogue is original and the characters are genuinely human...kudos to the cast!"
3,stuck!,"I really enjoy this game, but I seem to be stuck in one-player story mode and can't get out of it. I can't get past level 2, either, even with the guncon."
4,It's ok...,"The game's all right and everything. A bad thing about it is you can't save it and every time you die you have to start at the very beginning again and everything's exactly the same every time. And I don't know if it's my tv or what, but you can't shoot things at the end of the tv. If a guy pops up I have to hold the gun like an inch from the screen to shoot it."
1,This game bites the chimp ass!!!,This game is so bad that a 4 hour trip to the bathroom is much more entertaining...OUCHgame is still worse
2,mediocre,"for great fighting movies, it's important to incorporate a master/student relationship. ok storyline but it was focused so much on the drama surrounding the poor boy trying to make a living, it was just bland and unthrilling."
4,Great,This is exactaly what I thought this movie would be about. It helps that it has very attractive men fighting in a ring
1,One of the worst buys ever!!!,"I payed 15 bucks plus tax for this garbage movie. Lol! For the love of Christ these guys are good con artists. The freaking trailer looked like it would be a hell of a movie like someone else alerady said. Bad acting, Terrence Morris or whatever his name is used a terrible and gay irritating voice. The white guy can't even fight worth ish. He spends half the movie getting his tail kicked. The fights we're mediocre at best, even worst is the acting and lines. A horrific movie, please don't waste your time. The only bright spot about this movie is the hot latina chick. And I like latinas! That's why it earned a 1, otherwise I'd give it a freaking zero."
1,Horrible,Channing Tatum and Terrance Howard....enough said... two of the worst actors ever.. glad I didn't waste hard earned money on this movie... Just plain bad.
1,Booooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggg!,"Please don't waste your money on this movie! Please! I did and I'm sorry for it. It is slow and boring and NOT worth the price of admission, or DVD, or even On Demand. Just wait until it comes out on cable. You'll be glad you did!"
3,Fighting...,"This movie holds true to the title. The main stars of this movie include Channing Tatum, Terrence Howard, Brian White and Zulay Henao. The acting is great and the characters are very memorable...which means they really played their parts.Tatum plays Shawn a small town boy in the big city trying to feed himself and survive by selling books etc on the street. He gets connected to the gritty street fighting scene where big money can be made through Howard's character. Henao is Shawn's love interest. This is another underdog that comes up in the end story. If you enjoy boxing or street fighting movies...then you might want to get this one. It fits into the following genre of movies:Rocky - The Complete Saga Collection,Body and Soul,Penitentiary,Blood & Bone."
5,underated,I am suprised by all the bad reviews of this movie I thought that it probably wouldnt be very good before I saw it. But I thought it was a good movie not the greatest but good.
3,Good Movie,"This is a good movie. It starts off somewhat lame, but gets better towards the middle of the movie. I am giving the movie 3 out 5 stars. Any movie that stars Channing Tatum is worth watching just to see him."
3,"Good movie, bad BD","The movie is good, entertaining to watch on a sunday mornining.Nothing particularly special(acting, direction, edition, photography, story), but it has very good fight scenes.The quality of the image on this BluRay is very good but the SoundMix is awful.I reviewed a BD named ""Fair Game"" (Doug Liman, Sean Penn and Naomi Watts) with the very same problem:All the sound effects are too loud and the dialoge is too low; it's very hard to hear what people say in the movie."
3,Fighting,"I seriously don't know why this film is called Fighting. Its more of a love story. In all honesty. Three-fourths of the film was love and there was a big fight at the end for 100,000. And through out the movie...there was only like 3 fights. Most of the time Channing Tatum's character was thinking about some girl with a kid and he wants to fight for money to get her outta debt. Overall, as a Channing Tatum fan...its not worth the hype. =/"
3,I was let down,"When I decided to buy this movie I was so excited. I felt really let down. The story is just missing something. The fight scenes weren't all that great. I've never seen Channing Tatum as an idiot until I watched this movie. And Terrence Howard? This was so not his role. There just didn't seem to be any chemistry between these actors. It was too forced and the plot was cheesy and only half developed. If I had seen this movie prior to purchase, it would NOT have been a purchase. Rent or borrow it BEFORE you decide you want to own it."
3,kinda predictable...kinda weak,"There is no real superb acting from anyone, and there is no real over the top storyline, so that makes this a just slightly above average movie. The way the movie ends leaves it open for a sequel?...but why?Unrealistic ending, left me feeling that both Channing Tatum & Terence Howard must have had contractual obligations, or owed someone a favor, because this is most definitely not a good acting job by either one...overall I would say that it would make a good middle of the week rental, but that's it!!!"
1,Awful...nothing like the trailer...,"This movie is just plain bad...the trailer is nothing like the actual movie. Bad acting, slow plot line and more bad acting are what you can expect from this movie. Seriously, don't waste your time."
3,"pretty, but overpriced","this necklace was given to me by my family for the holidays. it is very pretty, but for the price paid, it was not a great value as the amethyst in the center was rather small, and the moonstones do not glisten as much as the picture depicts. it is quite pretty, but much more understated. at about $25 is the most i would pay for it."
2,The Futile Search for Einstein's Daughter,"This book was a fascinating read .... Other problems: The book bogged down in names and is hindered by a lack of an index. So when my head was swimming with names, I couldn't check the book's first mention of that person to be reminded who it was. Zackheim was repeatedly careless with pronouns, so a ""she"" or ""her"" in a sentence could refer to more than one woman.Zackheim speculated too much, such as who knew whom, and what motivated people. She speculated on small things, such as whether Einstein and his ex-wife resumed sexual relations. She speculated on big things - such as what happened to Lieserl.I was originally engrossed in the book. I dreamed about it one night, and the next day, I had to read the last 100 pages to find out what happened to Lieserl. Zackheim doesn't know. I felt let down."
2,Little Girl Lost--Or Not?,"Zackheim's style is certainly readable, but her conclusions leave something to be desired. She provides the reader with too much irrelevant or misleading detail and too many of her own strong opinions. I also found her explanation of Lieserl's ultimate fate to be unconvincing. To her credit, she has told a story that should be known, and provided a number of wonderful photos. In my opinion, two of the photos depict an extremely plausible candidate for an adult Lieserl."
3,Not bad,"Well-researched, well put together. Easy, pleasant reading. Nothing stunning or dramatic. On the plus side: Voyeuristic insights give reader access to the mysterious lives of Mileva and Albert. Letters and interviews bring them to life. Engaging description of the author's tracks in the mystical Voijvodina, Yugoslavia. On the minus side, two observations: (1) Regarding Lieserl, there are no new conclusions. The infant dies of scarlet fever, removing the shame and burden of an illegitimate child from Mileva, Albert, and their families. (2) Regarding Albert, the revelations about his coldness are not new. He is a man of another world, of unparalleled genius. Rating him by our human standards is impossible. Unfortunately for Mileva, she fell in love with him."
5,Excellent Novel,"Elaborate, profound and deeply felt. Here's the wit of Michele Zackheim, whose sharp eye caught details on Serbian culture, on women's feelings one hundred years ago. This book is not only about Lieserl--it's a treasury of cultural practices, women's thoughts and determination."
4,Another good one from Alice Medrich,"Alice Medrich is one of my favourite chocolate cookbook authors, and this one is another winner. Her recipes are all very carefully tested and if you follow her instructions you will be very pleased with the results. There is a range of simple to complex recipes, and all of the ones I've tried taste wonderful. The Breakfast Valentines are unassuming looking, but taste great! The Winter Solstice Cookies look and taste spectacular. I'm making them as my contribution to a Christmas cookie exchange. The Chocolate Cranberry Bread Pudding is wonderful ""comfort food"" and would be perfect for a holiday brunch. The Mocha Marjolaine looks very complicated, but is relatively simple to make, a nut meringue cake and a ganache. The ganache is divided, with part whipped for the filling and the rest used as a glaze. You will really impress company! These recipes are all in the winter section - I'm looking forward to spring, summer and fall to keep trying more of the recipes."
2,Underwhelmed and Disappointed.,"For a book that purports to be about prints, it contains few of them, and even then they're poorly presented and quite small on the page. It didn't deliver on the promise of the title or the description of the book in any shape, way, or form in my opinion. For the price, I'd expected something along the lines of CITY OF LAUGHTER or VAUXHALL: A HISTORY. Something beautiful and filled with images. That is not what this is. It's a small book with a few black and white prints, all of which I'd already seen elsewhere. For $30, I'd have kept it. For $130, I sent it back."
4,Good but not a satisfying epilogue,"The story was interesting, I liked the premises and how Caroline and Justin met while she discreetly owned the gaming establishment and then how they got to fall in love after they meet up again coincidently soon after she sells the gaming hall (though he doesnt recognize her of course). There was even a possible romance between Caroline's younger sister Phoebe and Justin's younger brother Harry. But the epilogue doesnt satisfy anything you really want to see or know about. For example, I rather have seen the h/h years later with a child or children (since it seemed important to Caroline and once you read the short story, you will know why) or at the very least to let us know if Phoebe and Harry get together rather than us assuming. Overall, good read."
4,Excellent,"This was my first introduction to Jackie Leven's solo material and what a great album to start with. Despite having a fairly decent knowledge of rock music history, I had never actually heard of Leven until I read an article about him after his death in Uncut magazine. I checked out Doll by Doll (how come these guys were overloooked?) and bought Elegy for Johnny Cash as a random selection.This is slickly produced roots rock with impeccable playing throughout the record. There is a world weariness to the lyrics but in a positive way, lots of booze, love and sex.totally recommended."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't waste your money, most of the chapters are about 2 to 3 pages long and are very generic. There are about 85 covered topics but not much time is spent on them."
3,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good program, could use a site to upgrade it every few years but makes a nice print out of best actors, actresses, NBA teams, NFL Teams ect for what ever date your wanting, also makes a ""What happened on this date"" section too, you can also add your own graphics and text so you can make your own. I've given printouts along with birthday cards for family and friends for an extra suprise in their cards."
2,The Day You Were Born,"There, is no update site which is not helpful at all.I purchased this to do for my grandchildren,and there is no data for info as of 1997-1999 For us old folks I guess it would suffice but to do elaborate work for anyone after 97 not good when you cant update.If there was update site Iwould rate it a 10 as for user bility great such as graphics and things you can do.just give me updates"
3,Day you were born UK updates,"I found this item on Ebay. Liked the format,very user friendly,but can not find ANY updates for the United Kingdom.DO THEY EXIST? If anyone could help, I would be grateful. Email me at gladi8or@msn.com"
1,Servicio esta muy deficiente,"Este libro de 2 CDs promete mucho en su promocion, pero ofrece realmente poco.Trae una explicacion de comandos como de instructivo y muy pocos ejercicios para su implementacion. ¿A quien le sirve saber lo que hace el software si no le enseña a hacerlo?Lo que me intereso inicialmente fue el taller de diseño que trae como promocion el cual NO VIENE CON EL CD, sino que hay que bajarlo del internet y a la fecha me ha sido imposible, ya que el enlace esta roto. Ha sido realmente un dolor de cabeza localizar a los vendedores del libro. Tardan mucho en responder y literalmente tiene uno que hacer ""click"" en cada uno de los correos electronicos que ponen en su sitio WEB ""a ver"" cual responde.No vale los $49.99 dolares. Esta carisimo para lo que es. No gasten su dinero en esto; mejor compren los libros virtuales (e-books) AutoCad I y AutoCad II, por menos de la mitad de precio y con mucho mas y mejor contenido."
2,Pathetic,"This was soooo stupid, first, it didnt really have to do with the tv guide at all. The only thing that swayed me from not trashing the CD was the fact i like crossword puzzles. that is why if u like crossword puzzles, this game is good for u."
4,beautiful,"Beauitful, I have this CD and I listen to it all the time.. This guy has a wonderful voice. If you like Spanish Romanic music then Cristian Castro is the man."
3,max factor tan #1,the seller is wonderful...items arrived early and in great condition.The product however leaves something to be desired. Seven out of ten were lighter than the other three. Not the sellers fault...I contacted Max Factor because I've run into this problem before. I think its quality control at factory.
3,slightly disappointed!,"I bought this for my twins thinking that I couldn't go wrong with the quality of a Selecta item. Well, I was wrong. It was easy enough to put together but the wood is pretty rough - especially in the painted areas. It isn't going to cause splinters but it isn't that nice to the touch. The roof is the one piece (well, 2 pieces) that doesn't get attached to the house and, as a result, it comes off easily during rougher play or if leaned on. It also feels pretty cramped. With access only from the front and low-ish ceilings it isn't that easy to get inside and move furniture around. It is very pretty though!"
1,Nice earring for BIG ears,"I purchased these earrings because I liked the look of the ornamental part, and for an inexpensive, everyday earring they do not dissapoint in this regard. However, the through-the-hole-leverback part is made for a GIANT. The hook is way too large and about twice as long as it should be, and this makes the entire earring unwearable. I am extremely disappointed. Take this into consideration before you make this purchase."
3,Cute earings for the price,"The earings are not too bad but they are smaller than what I thought they would be. They are suitable for casual, maybe work. Nothing to jump up about but then again they are still cute."
2,Returning this item,"Item came with uneven paint finish, and the glued on ledge was loose throughout the length of the mantel, which made me think it could come off if I pulled on it."
3,"Good, but very basic...","This was my first exposure to slide guitar instruction other than Youtube. I found it helpful, but only for getting started. Because I've been playing guitar for a while, I had hoped for something that would provide more material to play. With this dvd, you learn the basic mechanics of slide including vibrato, a few scales, and a few licks. A lot of info that most more advanced players won't need or want, including how to read notes and tab. You aren't going to get much more than the basics. If you are just want to get started, this will help. If you are hoping to start playing blues slide or something else, look elsewhere."
1,NOT FROM THE ELECTRIC COMPANY SHOW FOR KIDS,"This is not a ""best of"" cd of songs from The Electric Company show we knew as kids in the 1970's - please be advised and don't make the same mistake I did when I bought it thinking I'd hear ""Faster than a rolling O"" or ""Hey You Guys!"" and instead was in for a huge techno suprise."
3,"Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate","Another of the plethora of violent Charles Bronson flicks made back in the seventies. Charlie plays a professional killer called out of retirement in the Caribbean to track down a doctor who professes in the torture of humans. This is just like most of the others, chock-full of violence and disgusting scenes of flesh-mutilation; otherwise, the plot doesn't really contain much of anything else. This film probably will only be appreciated by die-hard Bronson fans."
3,From a bronson Fan - Good Bronson Flick!,"I just saw this movie for the first time and it was great. Bronson is hardcore in it. I espiecially enjoyed the wife-swapping/murder scene. (You just have to see it for yourself.) It is defenately a great flick for so late in his career.OK, so overall, not as good as the best- Death Wish 3, but it was defenately good. Check it out A LOT OF ACTION!!!"
5,A masterpiece,"I cannot believe the harsh reviews given here.Bronson is at the very top of his game in this film.Rest of cast good. Script good.Ok, subject matter disturbing, but torture happens folks , and at least CB makes them pay.Essential for any CB fan."
3,"ONE OF THE BETTER ""BRONSON""FILMS OF THE EIGHTIES","THIS FILM MAY BE ABSURD BY TODAY'S STANDARDS BUT ITS SURE BETTER THAN THE ""DEATH WISH"" SEQUALS. IN THIS 1984 THRILLER CHARLES BRONSON ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVERITE ACTORS PLAYS A RETIRED PROFESSINAL KILLER LIVING ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC WHEN ONE DAY HE IS SUMMONED OUT OF RETIRMENT TO AVENGE THE BRUTAL DEATH OF A FRIEND AT THE HANDS OF A SADISTIC TORTURER. WHEN BRONSON SYSTMATCALLYS KILLS EVERYONE ASSOICIATED WITH THE DOCTOR, THE DOCTOR FEARS FOR HIS LIFE AND GOES INTO HIDING. BUT BRONSON DRAWS HIM OUT BY HOLDING THE DOCTOR'S SISTER HOSTAGE WHO'S ALREADY DEAD. AND THIS LEADS TO THE DRAMATIC SCENE IN A ABANDON TEMPLE MINE WHERE BRONSON HAS HIS MISSION DONE FOR HIM WHEN THE LOCALS TRAP THE DOCTOR INSIDE HIS CAR AND START HACKING AND CHOPING AT THE DOCTOR UNTIL HE'S A BLOODY MESS. LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S A ABSURD FILM BUT I LIKE IT."
3,Unpleasant.,"This movie has a very nasty feel to it, starting off with a gruesome torture-scene. Never the less, it's the movie that made me aware of the brilliant Joseph Maher. He plays a ruthless doctor, doing the ugly work for corrupt governments. Charles Bronson is the guy on his tail. Does he get his man ?. -Let's just say, the ending is right out of Tod Browning's ""Freaks""(MGM,1932.) The whole cast is actually way too good for this kind of violent film. I think the opening scene is a bit too much, but typical of the brutal stuff Bronson appeared in during the 80's. -Not exactly a pleasure-cruise."
2,Disappointed,The only reason I purchased this Album with rush delivery ... was for the Felicity theme song. And what a bummer. It is just like TV 45 seconds of a song!! I am very disappointed. I love that song. I love the tune!
4,meep meep great!,"wicked album! this is by far one of the best soundtracks iv ever owned. i purely got it for the fact i got into the TV series and the music on the scenes seemed to really fit well.i missed a bit of the softmore year series but i watched it a few nights and then got addicted to it.anyway's! a fantastic album! really really worth buying, and if your not into waiting for things to be shipped normally from online shopping, order this, its so worth the wait.the best tracks in my opinion have to be La Cienega Just Smiled - Ryan Adam & King of Yesterday - Jude,also the theme song is so wicked, a shame its not made into a longer version its so addictive.so..FANTASTIC album, FANTASTIC TV show, lets just hope they do re-runs of it."
2,Just ok,"I purchased this CD before seeing the final episode and before this I only remembered one song. It seems all the songs on this CD are in the final episode. Coincidence or laziness?? Personally, I feel there were much better songs that should have been included on this CD so am abit disappointed with it."
5,"Grows on you, just like the first soundtrack :)","Its a great CD, it definitely grows on you. All felicity music does...this great show will be missed. The music just adds so much to it. Buy this CD, you won't regret it."
3,not what I expected!,"This CD wasn't what I expected and I mean that in a bad way. I thought it would be more up-beat, but it ended up being a great CD to sleep to. OH Well, I still loved the songs, but they made me depressed. Buy at your own risk."
5,Sheer Magic,"I bought this CD on the off-chance, having ""tuned in"" to the music of the TV series but was prepared to be disappointed.WOW was I wrong! This is a fabulous compilation and I congratulate whoever put it together. Sheer magic and my favourite is ""Casual Viewin"", a swinging, rocking, foottapper with hard-to-learn but easy-to-hear lyrics which are a little on the ""wicked"" side. WARNING!! Do not listen to this track while driving your car!! - You are likely to go ballistic!My only question is, where to now? I have the sophomore and senior year collections. Will there be a third CD? Hopefully."
4,Perfect or Beautiful?,"This is a great cross-section of the music that made the show so great - highly recommended. The Kendall Payne song is excellent but I kinda sorta wish they would have used ""Honest"" instead, from the scene where Ben told Felicity that Lauren was pregnant. Anyway, I just have one question... I bought my copy of the CD at the store and, although the cover (and every track listing I can find) lists ""Perfect"" as the Maren Ord track, the track on the CD is really her song ""Beautiful."" What gives? Have I won the lottery or is everyone's like that?"
4,I Just Smiled,"Great album. Superbly selected mix of songs from Felicity's senior year. I think the clear standout on the album is Ryan Adams' ""La Cienega Just Smiled"", but the Barenaked Ladies, Maren Ord, Sixpence None The Richer and Jude all check in with songs to complement the general mood of the album, which complements the general mood of the show and that is light and subdued.Also, I like the new theme song. I enjoyed the earlier W.G. ""Snuffy"" Walden version, but this one is catchy and fun. Overall, a worthy album."
5,Fun to read!,The Club of Queer Trades is by far the funniest story I have ever read! I assure you that it will keep you rolling on the floor from the beginning to the end of the story.
3,"Interesting, sometimes fun","The Man Who Was Thursday is one of the coolest titles I've ever heard and I liked the story, but it also let me down. It does not live up to the title, and yet, I remember it pretty vividly. The thing about Chesterton is that he may not have ever had a meaning. I think he wrote things to be bizarre and cool and elementally obsurb, kind of like a nightmare. But there is not meaning in the strange things that happen, neccessarily. The other stories I do not remember at all. I know I read them but they were not that powerful and there aren't any lines or theological threads that will awe you or shock you, so really it fizzles instead of sizzles like Dostoevsky did at times in Brothers Karamazov. The Ball and the Cross is a battle with a saint and the devil. I liked the book but there are a lot of other better reads out there. Stick to Man Who Was Thursday probably and move on with your life."
5,Tableware Storage box,Great item for storing heavy tableware. It is so much better than the softsided versions.
1,disappointed,"I recieved my package in a ""factory sealed"", or some type of plastic wrap. The first disc that tells you how to use ALL the rest of the discs.....WONT PLAY---defective.....so to say the least...yes very disappointed. wont buy again. wrote to buyer....they told me to purchase one on line and would not replace defective merchandise......hmmm."
4,belt buckle,"This buckle was good for a laugh when stockings were dumped. The words are a bit small. As my daughter put it, ""If you can read this, you're too close to my package."" But the quality is ok and my son liked it."
2,Not even close to the NREMT,"I bought this book hoping to get a good idea of what the NREMT test would be like. After studying it for quite some time, I felt that I was in great shape for the test and had a good idea of what the test would be like. That was not the case.The tests that are in this book are very straightforward and have relatively obvious answers. They also have several ""All of the above"" types of questions, none of which are found on the test. The practice test at the end of the book doesn't contain any questions that resemble the actual Registry test. There may have been a time where the test questions in the book matched the national registry, but that is not the case anymore.It was not a total waste; there were chapter questions that did offer a different point of view than what I had picked up in my EMT class, but overall it was a waste of time; I think I would have been better to have stuck with studying the Brady book."
4,Miracle Worker,"It is a very good movie, but it was actually different from the old film starring Patty Duke. Hallie did a great job to act as Helen Keller. According to the Story of Helen Keller, Hallie looks like young Helen Keller. It is great!!!!!"
1,an abomination,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The original Miracle Worker (1962) is one of my favorite movies of all time- I watch it over and over. Incredible. Simply one of the most perfect movies ever made, in my estimation. This one is GARBAGE. Everything about this movie is BAD- the only good thing about it was the original premise, the original story of Helen Keller. The little girl's acting is just unbelievably bad- you don't believe for a minute that she is deaf and blind. Save your money and buy the life-affirming, incredibly profound and powerful 1962 version!!!"
3,The Remake,"After I watched this movie, I still like the original 1962 better. Why? Because it has more emotional impact in it, and it has really funny scenes like the ""feeling emotions on faces"" the original has. The ""battle of wills"" is more tame in this (the Disney version) one than the original. I've noticed they left out some really good scenes that was from the original.This version from Disney is ok. The actress who played Anne Sullivan did good, but I like the original James (Helen's half-brother) better than this one. The little girl who played Helen in this version is not as good as Patty Duke, but she did well.If I had a choice, I'd pick the original. But this is good to watch too, if you want to see both versions, even though it is MUCH different than the 1962 movie."
2,"""The Miracle Worker"" is the story of Helen Keller.","Although this is a slightly above-average picture with some very good actors, ""The Miracle Worker"" unfortunately doesn't offer that much in the DVD department. Possibly worth a rental."
2,"Bland, bland, bland","I use clips from this production with my drama class to compare and contrast with the original version. In particular we look at the famous dining room scene which, in this version, is a tepid rendition without passion or energy. Why the plaintive cello music? Instead of highlighting the central battle of wills between Anne and Helen, it seems to be urging us to feel pity for Helen, the very thing Sullivan was combating within the Keller family.This version also adds dialogue to emphasize the subplot between Captain Keller and James - the original James was callow and abrasive, but I find this one unbearable. Overall a beautiful adaptation to look at but lacking a firm directorial vision."
5,Love it!,"I love this movie, I remember watching it when I was young in school... I recommend it to people of all ages."
3,Definitely didn't have the effect of the original,"Okay, so I am sort of a Helen Keller fanatic and I love knowing a lot about her but Hallie Kate Eisenberg wasn't really as deep and emotional as Patty Duke was in the original 1962 version. I have yet to see the 1970 version Starring Patty Duke (as Annie Sullivan this time) and Melissa Gilbert. Allison Elliot was quite good at acting out the legendary Annie Sullivan, but like Eisenberg, she did not have the affect that Anne Bancroft had in the 1962 version. ""The Miracle Worker"" starring Alison Elliott and Hallie Eisenberg was a touching story, but I cannot give much credit on the acting."
3,Cheesy,"You've gotta hand it to Disney -- they Disneyfie everything they do! Most of the time that's a good thing, but not so much in the case of this movie. The old one starring Patty Duke was much better in the respect of cast. Everyone CLASHED -- and that was a GOOD thing because it was half the conflict, which is a vital ellement in any movie. Also, Patty Duke was a Helen with a broader range of emotion. This new one is 1)Blank, or 2)Sour. And Lucas Black as James?! I like him, but he was NOT the guy for the role. I much prefer the sarcastic, withdrawn, hurting young man in the 1960's movie. He wanted to be loved and accepted for himself, but was much too proud to stoop to whining or openly pointing out his father's favoritism. Yes, these new characters are definately modulated. And, to me, downright bland. Helen's longing for knowledge was better depicted in the old movie, as well as Annie's restless yearning to impart it to her."
4,=D,"I thought that this was a great movie. I especially liked it because my one of my favorite actors, Lucas Black, is in it. He does not have a very big part, but his preformance was great with his adorable southern accent. This is a great movie for others to learn about Helen Keller. :)"
1,This movie totally sucks!,"I cannot believe all the other positive reviews I'm seeing! As usual, Disney has taken a wonderful story and distorted it with fictional information. I am from Alabama and have visited Ivy Green twice. Aside from the obvious disregard for authenticity with the set, they also missed the mark on several facts. Just one example--the Kellers did not have slaves, they had sharecroppers. Slavery had been abolished by the time Helen was born in 1880! No wonder people have such warped images of the South, thanks to irresponsible filmakers like this. The story was great enough to stand on its own without all the changes, just as it has for many years. Disney changes it because they apparently aren't confident enough in their ability to produce a good film. This movie only further proves that. Don't waste your time on this one, parents. If you want your kids to know TRUE history, go for the other films about Helen Keller's life."
4,I saw it on TV and want it for myself!,"In two words, I would say ""Loved it."" It was on ABC a while back, and wished I taped it. I caught the whole thing,and didn't expect it to be good, but really enjoyed it. Now it's finally coming out on tape, and I couldn't be happier. The Pepsi girl (she's a cutie) was very good, being Helen Keller. I read the story of Helen Keller and figured to watch the movie. I'm glad I did. :o)"
5,Very Heart Touching story,This story is soo sad about the girl who is deaf and can't see.But it's a great movie and I love it!This is such a great movie with a happy ending.!@#$%^&*()Melissa!@#$%^&*()
2,Don't Buy,"I live in Japan so take it from me, this book is not good. A lot of the vocab is painfully inaccurate. In fact, I wonder at times how this book was ever published. For example, the book claims the word, ""domo"" means, ""Thank you very much."" If you walk around in Japan saying, ""domo"" to people you don't know you will be viewed as incredibly rude. ""Domo"" is a, ""thanks"" to be used among friends only and in no context does it mean, ""thank you very much."" The book is poorly laid out and does not make a great deal of sense. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it has a few decent pointers on etiquette. Get it from a library if you can but DO NOT buy this. For those of you expecting to speak conversational Japanese in 7 days as the title suggests, it won't happen. The title is as such because the book is meant to be read over 7 days."
1,Waste of Money!,"I only wish I could give this book 0 stars...because it doesn't deserve the 1 it is getting...but here goes!All I learned in 7 days was what a waste of money this book/tape set was! This book, along with the cassette tapes, are absolutely horrible. The book does not follow what is on the tapes, and the tapes do not follow the book. There are sentences on the tapes that are not in the book, and vice-versa. Also, half of the important stuff in the book is not covered at all on the tapes, making the whole set utterly useless.If you take the money you would spend on this book and burn it in your fireplace, then take the ashes and flush them down your toilet...you still would have used your cash more wisely than purchasing this worthless piece of garbage!If you are intent on learning Japanese...try ""Learn In Your Car Japanese"" by Henry N. Raymond. It will take you longer than seven days...but you will at least learn more than how to say ""Man I was ripped off!"" in English!"
1,Japanese in 7 days - no way,The tapes were difficult to understand and hard to follow. The text books were long and boring and i still can't speak nor write Japanese!
3,Get it if you are into that kind of stuff.,"If you're into corny sci-fi from the 60's and 70's get it! If you only watch blockbusters and chick flicks, stay away! I love old yul brynner sci-fi movies and max von sydow actually did a great acting job for being a B movie sci-fi flick, so the purchase was good for me. Battle beneath the earth was OK too. The beginning is kind of catchy, ""just like ants!"". Drink plenty coffea to make it through the middle of the movie. Enjoy! P.S. if you like Yul Brynner Sci-Fi movies, make sure to get ""Future World"" & ""West World""!"
2,Battle Beneath the Earth/The Ultimate Warrior,"This is maybee one of the first movie that get a ""hint"" of the future without our normal supply of oil etc."
1,Too complicated with bad explination,"I recently purchased this product and was very disappointed by it's performance. It comes with an introductory c++, directx7, genesis3d, and an actor creator. It is very confusing to use any of these programs and found myself blowing [my money]. I strongly recommend you look elsewhere"
4,Gr8,This starter kit got me started with programming. I reccomend it to anyone who ever wished they could make their own game.
2,Not for the average anybody.,"At first glance, a thought comes to your head - ""Wouldn't it be cool to create your very own video game!"" I work for the Video Game publisher Vatical Entertainment and believe me, this is anything but easy. The one program, Genesis 3D, can be downloaded for free at genesis3d.com, and the book tells you nothing accept a few interviews with publishers. The documentation is just short c++ references to the source code in the engine which you wouldn't be able to understand without an extensive knowledge of c++ much less know how to use it to make a game. It doesn't come with a 3-d modeler, which you need, just an animator which I believe you can also get for free. So in short, even though it looks and sounds great, you would never be able to create a game using it."
3,Overall a good read,I didn't like all of the stories in the book. Some were just hard to read (ie. A Clockwork Orange) or hard to keep interest.
5,AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE.........,"At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy video but in a matter of minutes I was laughing out loud. It's hilarious! The ad libs, the audience participation, wonderful old time television. The picture quality is not A-1 but that can't be expected from the old kinescope recordings but it is still very good. There really is not much ""unknown"" stuff here but the video itself is great. Wonderful to see Sinatra, Ethel Barrymore, Liberace, Donald O'Connor and more. Also nice to see Mrs. Durante and Jimmy's adopted daughter CeCe speaking about their husband and father. My personal opinion of this DVD is five stars in spite of whatever flaws it has. Sorry that they have discontinued producing it."
2,If You LIke Leonard Maltin,"Too often on DVD's that are retrospective, contemporary people who have nothing to do with the subject of the DVD are included with their silly opinions. On this it is Leonard Maltin whose head and moving mouth comprise about 1/4 to 1/3 of the one hour. Seeing Mr. Durante's wife and daughter speak today is fine. They were there. Maltin was not and while a Maltin DVD can include his opinions and insight, he does not belong here. With the plethora of people from then, both then and now, who can be included, it befuddles and annoys me why Leonard Maltin peppers this DVD so generously that it should be called ""Maltin on Durante."""
3,SoSo,If you are looking for graphics just for fun this CD is for you. I wanted it because i like to make games with a program I have and these graphics are perfect for some of the games i have made. If you want this CD for serious stuff such as presentations and other prodjects i suggest not buying it- It is more for leisure.
4,finally-current information,"Too little, too late, too generic has been my complaint on Mopar based engine books. Even the factory manuals have ignored the small block, especially the R series. At long last we have a book that at least acknowledges their existence. This manually actually focuses on the performance heads and blocks available instead of just the 30 year old factory stuff. A must have for anyone with a small block mopar."
5,"If you can't say anything good, dont say anything","Now that stroker cranks and heads are more affordable for Small Block Mopars its more a case of why wouldn't you stroke. This book follows along the lines of How To Hot Rod Small Block Mopars by Larry Shepard and includes various engine packages in the rear - which is great and gives you an idea of what can be achieved and what parts are required to do it, it also includes heaps of websites to check which is also great. The photos are great,gives superb guidance and ideas to pursue and really is a must for anyone building a stroker. Some of the detail can be a bit light if you are the type that really wants to know everything, but I think for 90% of readers like me its excellent and you won't regret the purchase price. In the long run it will probably save you money e.g. fitting Eagle Rods instead of resizing and grinding the block for your original rods."
2,No Details,"This book is a great idea, but is very skimpy with the details. The interviews consist of two questions (the same for each person) that cover general advice, but nothing specific about what the careers involve. Some fields don't need this detail (high school education is something most of us are familiar with), but if I want to learn what a policy advisor actually does every day, I'll need to look beyond the ""policy"" career section of this book. It was full of advice for success (improve your communication skills, do what you love), but rather short on what tasks you'd actually need to succeed at to make it in a particular career."
1,klkl,"""Dear Sir,I have been using the Polo Ralph product over 7 years and this is the first time I purchase it from Amazon.I received the product at my address - everything seemed to be fine, but when I used the perfume I noticed that the contents / the product itself is definitely not ""Polo FOR MEN by Ralph Lauren"" as I've known for several years.I have always heard that Amazon is a very serious company and I don't want to believe that I Amazon send me a fake product.The product is available to be picked up at the delivery address.I would appreciate your response.Best regardsPatrick Mosseri."""
4,Loved it.,It was an important gift for my daughter's first day at work. The seller was very accomedating. The gift was a big hit.
4,Nice & Sonny,"Sonny Stitt recorded a ridiculous number of albums in his career, and while only a fraction of them have made it to CD, it can still be hard to figure out which titles to buy. This out-of-print (and currently reasonably priced) MCA disc was originally released on the Argo label in 1958. The reissue producer was not certain of the lineup but it is most likely Barry Harris on piano, William Austin on bass and Frank Gant on drums. What is certain is the solid sound and performances, especially by Stitt, who could be extremely hot or cold at any given appearance. In my opinion, the best Stitt discs are stillSonny Stitt Sits in With the Oscar Peterson Trio,New York Jazz (Dig), andPersonal Appearance(see my review of the latter), but this isn't far behind."
3,a little werid,Lottie is a little girl who loves her dog Patrick. Patrick doesn't have to eat vegetables so she decides that she won't eat them either. Lottie decides to eat only bread and cheese. Something strange starts to happen to Lottie she turns into a rat! Partick comes up with an idea that he hopes will save Lottie and make her a little girl again! Read Ooh La La Lottie to find out!
4,"a good book, for beginers","I thought this book was great, it had it pros and cons. Such as, it didn't describe the drying process in great detail, and we all know this is the most important part. all and all it was a good book."
1,Subtitles instead of English.,"The disk version offers English and yet this is provided in a language that most US Amazon Prime viewers do not speak fluently. Those who have handicaps which prevent them from reading subtitles well or at all, are up a creek."
1,Censored to the extreme,"Terrible to the point of being not worth watching, which says a lot for a free anime. If it was uncensored, maybe it would be worth it, but how could any of us tell when it's impossible to finish watching a single episode? Do yourself a favor and skip this ridiculous series."
4,good,"It's a good and entertaining anime but the picture it's kind of blurry or maybe its the way they did the animation. It's mature content which is great for me but this is the censored version(too bad). I love the Japanese version of any anime, I hate when the put on the English version it takes away what the original idea the producer its trying to bring to life. Enjoy this anime!"
4,Entertaining. The only DVDs of its kind,"It's entertaining and informative. The computer graphic does help viewers see the formations of the battles clearer. However, it's not as exciting as dramatized scenes played by human beings. History channel should have used both of these means in making these DVDs.Another problem is they don't have subtitles. As a result, there were many times I did not know how to spell the name of a person or a location mentioned by the narrator. I had to search for them on the Internet and in history books.They are still worth watching. I own them."
4,Fun to watch,"So the historical ramp up to each battle is good, but this should be a giant advertisement for Rome Total War and RTW Barbarians. They use this game to show the battles. My kids loved it because as my youngest put it ""Seeing a real battle would scare him."" Good for the classroom or while you are playing RTW."
4,"Interesting and factual, but uninspiring graphics","If you enjoy ancient history, particularly ancient military history, this is a decent series. The battles are ""fought"" using the game engine of Rome:Total War, which was probably pretty impressive when this was first released. However, the graphics now look dated, with the different armies looking pretty darn similar, just with differently colored uniforms (you have the Roman template, the barbarian template, and the middle eastern/asian template). The animations do a good job of showing the tactics involved, and the narrator and historians do a good job of explaining motivations and the events of the battles, leading to an overall solid series. Just don't expect to be impressed with the animation graphics."
2,Decisive Battles of the Ancient World,"I would have given this DVD only one star but the accuracy and completeness of these battles where very good. It is the stick figure animation that is at least 20 years outdated. Maybe 30 years out-dated, that I had to give this film 2 starts. I did not expect a super computer enhanced realistic animation. But I did not expect stick figures one step removed from Pak-Man. Yes the animation is that BAD! Save your money and do not buy this piece of junk. This is 2012 not 1980. They could easily have made the animation at least decent not stick figures."
5,A Great Teaching Tool !,"My two sons have enjoyed and learned so much from this DVD. I thought that the ""computer game"" format would hold their attention, and it DID! There is a wealth of historical information in each 30 minute-ish battle."
2,Great idea ruined by corny computer graphics,"When I purchased this DVD set I had high hopes. Unfortunately the episodes are ruined by the video/computer game graphics that are supposed to enhance understanding for the viewer. Instead, they completely annoyed me after only one episode, and I had to force myself to watch the rest since I shelled out the cash for the set. The movements of the troops are too repetitive, robotic, take up too much on-screen time, and are just plain corny. I really would have enjoyed this set had it not been for the computer game graphics (and by computer game graphics, we're not talking X-Box 360 here, maybe early playstation 2). Too bad."
5,Bulgaria's best poet,"Blaga Dimitrova is Bulgaria's greatest living poet, and perhaps, is one of the greatest poets writing in any language today. This translation aptly captures the beauty and force of her work, and a great deal of the sheer beauty of her verse. This book should be a must buy for anyone interested in Bulgarian literature and East European in general."
5,Great roll of wire,Great Roll of wire...enough said! I was able to do the job well and so far has held up well on the exterior underside of my truck.
4,Problem with build up,"Shipped quickly and safely to australia. Much cheaper than locally sourced hormone creams. A very nice moisturising cream - absorbed easily, and not waxy ors ticky like the others i have tried. Also being two in one for a small person like me made it easy to apply without running out of skin! Certainly has active hormones in it- hot flashes dissapeared straight away but being peri menopausal perhaps at the stated dosage it was a bit strong or tends to accumulate in the fat after two months so I switched to progesterone only because of breast engorgement."
1,For the First Time?,"Except for the packaging, this is EXACTLY the same dvd as Out of the Woods: Unauthorized, released two years prior. The distributer didn't even bother to change the menu on the disc. This is blatant false advertising. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! (Honestly, it was pretty mediocre the first time around, anyway.)"
1,I Hate These Unauthorised DVD Doco's,"I saw about 20 of these on ebay but none had any description... So I came on here and oh boy.. am I glad I did!It's just that awful out of the woods doco but in a different cover.My sister had bought that DVD a few years ago (despite my warnings about those stupid unauthorised DVD doco's). I only sat through about 5 minutes of it.It's just a bunch of radio dj's and ""industry experts"" talking about the cure.To be honest, save your meny and tape yourself having a conversation with your friends about the cure and you'll get something equally as exciting."
3,"Great product, awful packaging","I love this product. I put it on my bleached hair and it looks amazingly purple for a few weeks. From there, it fades to a shade of hot pink that I've also fallen in love with and have decided to stick with. My next dye-job will be with the same brand in Atomic Pink.However, when I ordered from this seller, the bottle arrived in a flimsy bubble envelope with no other padding or wrapping, and the bottle was crushed and dye was everywhere. It was unusable! Have returned for a refund... after properly wrapping and cleaning the mess they left me. Yuck."
2,Watch the expiration dates!,"This pack of mac and cheese had an expiration date of 10/31/06. Not that we're talking about the most nutritious food to start out with anyway, but I hate paying for items at/near their expiration date. I expected some reasonable amount of shelf life."
5,a masterwork,"Carax's Melville is one of the great films of the last decade and certainly on a par with Claire Denis's Beau Travail, her version of Melville's Billy Budd. Pierre is Melville's most enigmatic work and Carax illuminates the mystery by placing it in our world, the dawn of the twenty-first century, where the spectator must enter--the viewer become a reader again--unriddling this Hamlet from the inside out."
1,A Disappointing Mess,"Never have I seen such a dull jumbled mess of a movie. And I thought Carax's earlier ""Lovers on the Bridge"" was AMAZING! The story doesn't make sense and neither do the characters' motivations. Don't waste your time with this film."
3,If you could hang people for being annoying...,"...the girl who plays Isabelle would be dead by now. She has the most annoying squeaky voice and the most annoying Slavic accent. There is a scene in the woods, where she goes on and on about her miserable childhood, and after 90 seconds you are ready to wrap that dark hair around her neck and strangle her. The girl who plays Lucie is much more palatable, because she stays quiet most of the time.It's really hard to feel sorry for the characters in the movie, because none of them are really sympathetic. The only one I felt sorry for was the little gypsy girl who got killed by the passer-by."
2,Over-rated Psycho-drama,i was looking for a movie with a lot more visual and sensual appeal. sure i enjoyed seeing catherine deneuve topless but the movie itself is a disjointed final climax in insanity. there was very little sensuality also.
1,Just Awful,"Can't believe I wasted my time watching this boring drivel/downer of a movie. If this is the best the French can come up with, they're in sad shape. Complete Jabberwocky, the plot makes no sense whatsoever, the acting is leaden, depressing, joyless, and pitiful, perhaps because they didn't have anything even relating to a real movie script to work from. What the hell were the producers thinking when they allowed this thing to be filmed?"
2,A complete mess,"Pola X is beautifully filmed and well made, but that's about it. You don't feel anything for the characters, no matter how good the actors are and no matter how hard the director tries to get the viewer involved. This movie is a complete mess and even that explicit love scene can't make up for it. Pass this one by!"
5,RIP CHRIS,"First saw this wonderful musician on HBO. bought his album and fell in love with his music.i listen to hard rock and metal, but whenever one of his songs shows up in my mix, i stop and listen. he was sooo good and will be missed. now i have find the rest of his albums. my heart aches today."
4,Love & War,"Whitley's '05 release on Messenger Records was produced by Malcolm Burn, who turned the knobs on his debut, ""Living w/ the Law."" But it's not another ""Living w/ the Law,"" if that's what you were hoping for and I doubt you'll ever get it. Whitley is always pushing himself into new directions and experimenting with different sounds while always retaining his own unique vision & vibe.""Soft Dangerous Shores"" has some more topical, political & war-related titles and songs but is also very much a romantic release. That's obvious from the cd's artwork and from some of the songs, of course. Kind of an understated album. Maybe a bit of ""Perfect Day"" along with the quietness of ""Hotel Vast Horizon."" If you're a Whitley fan/collector, you'll want it. If you're not, get it anyway. You wanna grow as a person, don't ya?"
1,Copper or aluminum will defrost quickly,"Aluminum pans are a great way to defrost food, but if you have a pan with a copper bottom use it to defrost a steak much fast then this item."
2,Jack of all and master of none.,"This book summarize almost all well known mysteries. Many topics requires in-depth analysis and explanation but this book just introduces topics and mentions what other people have written about.Topics like Bermuda triangle, Inca, Egypt, Shangri-la are just discussed, of course there are books out there which gives meaningful insight.This book is very useful for person who wants to know names and brief details of world mysteries."
4,Very Interesting,"Haven't figured out whether or not I believe what Sylvia believes, but it's very interesting to think about the unknown. Aliens, fairies, Jesus living on earth after crucifiction, underworlds.......I loved the Da Vinci Code and it's the Jesus stuff that is really catching my attention."
3,Love Sylvia Browne but not this book,"I have read many of her books and I have found them all very interestingand great readings. Most i would read in a few days time but this book did fit my exceptations and struggled with reading it. It was much slower then the rest of her other books. Although i found many parts very interesting and knowledgeable, it just was not the kind of book i expected. But it's okay she can't have 100% great book out of the 20 some odd ones she already has out..."
2,I'm HUGE Sylvia Browne fan HOWEVER.....,"I usually enjoy reading Ms. Browne's books, but I must say even I (one of her biggest fans) was disappointed in this book. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because SOME of the information was interesting, however I could have found most of it online! In fact she refers to websites throughout the book. I thought the book would contain more psychic information than it did---just a few tid bits from Francine. It seems as though she compiled some data from online and wrote the book on one of her flights. I'm sure she did more research than that, but the book just reads like it was thrown together in a rush. If you are interested in this book, I highly recommend just getting it from the library."
3,"amusing, but not actually much there","This book is vaguely entertaining, as it does offer some unique perspectives on many of the ancient myths and legends of humanity. However, that perspective is often colored by the author's apparent desire to prove just how incredible she is. Often, her explanations for mysterious phenomena have no resemblence whatsoever to common sense or scientific reality. And while I am well aware that science doesn't have all the answers (I am a witch, after all), I still expect theories to be based on some sort of circumstantial evidence. many of the theories (portrayed as statements of fact by the author), come across as elaborate delusions. For people with a passing interest in supernatural phenomena, this book is a good start. But for those of us who have been studying these topics for a while, there is nothing of value here."
4,A Must Read!,"I love this book because it tells secrets about the world that scholars or historians, etc. couldn't and maybe never can. I also love it because it tells the origins of the Essenes and Gnostics (being a gnostic, not a gnostic christian like the scholars stupidly coins). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt like she wasn't giving very much psychic interpretations in the beginning of the book. Only what the scholars or whatever think about."
5,Biggest mystery of all....,"The biggest mystery Sylvia left un-addressed was the book's dedication. She dedicated the book to her second husband, Dal Brown, whom she would gladly watch roast on a spit over an open fire (her words, not mine - she says it on one of her CDs). Now, this is the man who nearly bankrupted her...and she's dedicating a book to him? Hmmmmm...."
5,Sylvia has done it again!!,"Lovely book, inspiring message for those open enough to receive it. Written in the style of her ground-breaking ""The Other Side and Back"" and ""Life On The Other Side"", both of which I always recommend to those in my ministry who have suffered loss through the passing of a loved one.I am apalled at the Publisher's Weekly ""Reviewer"" and his/her overly-biased paragraph of closed-minded trash they call a review. This ""reviewer"" obviously has had little or no experience with the Spirit Realm and has no business reviewing spiritually-centered literature. He/she is a git and an idiot."
3,Uninformative on some things,I was disappointed in the content of the subject matter. There were many sections that I skipped over due to being uninteresting.
2,Conglomoration of Mysteries,"Now, this is not an original work, but borders on plagiarism. All these phenomenon can be looked up elsewhere.I have often said, that my gender does not know how to write. They are busy as bees typing away like crazy but untalented secretaries. They are housewife-cook-book-style-authors at best! What Sylvia calls her research, I call just look it up in Fact Monster on the Internet! Her guide Francine is uttlery not believable with her commonplace statements and has to be a fiction of Sylvia's imagination. Read it yourself and find out!"
4,secrets and mysteries of the world,"It was alright,not one of her best. but itt was a interesting read."
4,Kindle Edition,"I thought this was a great book overall, but think that the Kindle version has a fault. The text on the chapter tittle pages cannot be scaled and therefore I could not read that part of the book. I do have a 20/20 eye sight but still struggled to make the words on that page.Other than that, I find this book great to get a quick knowledge of all the mysteries out there."
2,No Secrets Here,"SECRETS & MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD by Sylvia Browne is a very superficial accounting of many of the world mysteries that have been discussed in myriads of volumes.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS"
3,good book..however....,"I liked this book when I was into her... however throughout the last few years.. Ive come to realize not only is she soooo FAKE! But parts of this book are even ""borrowed"" from others' work. Alas I grew to not only distrust her and her $$$ hungry schemes... but can barely watch her on TV pushing her crap anymore... Kinda interesting read though.. lol"
3,JUST SO SO MOSTLY FLUFF,"This book is only good for someone who is just starting to get interested in the supernatural. The worst thing about this book is that it skims the top of every subject but it will be perfect for kids. Now I understand how Sylvia has written so many books, it probably took two weeks to write this one. I'll still buy more of her books but next time I'll be more selective. This is where I regret not going to a book store,if I had the chance to really look through it I wouldn't have bought it."
2,A good introduction to the mysteries,"This book was enjoyable and brought back many memories of my youth. I used to explore many of these topics with my childhood friend John back in New York. I wish I had written it!Everything is here from Atlantis to Bigfoot to the Bermuda Triangle. There are many topics that Sylvia Browne touches on. This is not a full in depth of each topic but rather a quick introduction along with the author's opinion on these matters, some I agree with, others I do not.Much of this information is easily found online in much more depth, but I think this is a decent book for beginners."
4,Very Interesting Points of View,"I have to admit that some of the conclusions that Sylvia Browne comes to in this book are really far fetched but it is so interesting to read about. For example her explanation of Bigfoot is that the creature is a Tulpa. A Tulpa is something created from the thoughts and energies from human beings that is so strong that the energies create an actual creature. So if people really believe they saw him it is all a great human illusion, we created him so we do actually see him. That explanation makes sense to me. I had a hard time with what she said about Atlantis. You'll have to read to find out but has to do with Aliens. It's funny because I find myself believing some things and then other things I flat out can't believe but it's very thought provoking."
4,This book is alot more scientific than her other books.,This book is based on scientific research. It has alot of interesting topics.
3,"Science, Fiction, or what?","I think it is a good read but you need to take it with a healthy dose of skepticism. Ms. Browne ""visits"" many mysterious sites and places that for whatever reason often provoked human's wildest imagination. But whether you agree with her or not, it is still interesting to read. Try it out and then decide for yourself. I also found the historic roots of many legends, rituals, and religious beliefs significant reasons for all of us to dig deeper. It wouldn't be the first time research has been flawed and I felt I learned something.Slyvia is gifted, of that I'm completely convinced. Overall, this book presents readers with many interesting ideas to ponder. It may be too much for some reader's plates, but they'll definitely be left full of new questions"
1,I resent buying books that:,I resent buying books that I have read before but have been repackaged and marketed as new!!! I love Nora Robert's books but lately I have been very careful about reading the publishing date before buying.I wish someone would tell her or her publisher this before I refuse to buy any of her books!!!
3,Quick read,"I breezed through this volume last weekend and was kind of bored. They are both reprints and 'The Heart's Victory' was only vaguely interesting because the main characters were involved in car racing, indirectly. I never really warmed up to the characters, which is an oddity when reading Nora Roberts. I'll stick to the new stuff."
5,Cool!,"This game is really fun. You have to look for the ""right animal"" while given clues. You can play games, and read their ""essays"". I didn't know an educational game could be so fun!"
2,Floyd Abrams,"I read this book in between ""The Nine"" by Jeffery ToobinThe Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Courtand ""The Brethren"" by Bob WoodwardThe Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court. I almost gave up reading law related books because of it. The book is to be a list of cases he has been involved in and what he did in them--but it lacks any of the draw of a real insider account. It isn't a book about free speech it is more about Floyd Abrams and what he does. The few things you couldn't know otherwise are limited to his thoughts at the time (might I lose this case again?) for the most part. As far as law related books go there are better ones that are more interesting."
4,Shocking Stuff,"Okay, I should have paid more attention in school when we studied the First Amendment but I honestly did not believe it would be information that I would affect me so much in life. This book was easy to read and shocking to learn. The examples Abrams offers in his book make my head shake with wonder. I couldn't help but continue to think about his case studies well after I read the book. He presents his information to non-lawyers so much better than any textbook could have managed. Outstanding book."
2,"Nice & sturdy, but the sound is really TINNY!!","I love the look of this item. It's a nicely built and sturdy little JEEP product.The anti-fog mirror is great, but could be a little better - I still have to wipe it off with my hand fairly often.Radio and CD player both work very well, but the sound is quite ""tinny"". I REALLY wish it had better speakers... I suppose that is hard to do since it is made to be used in a shower environment, but still...Also, digital tuning for the radio and a digital clock would be a great improvement.Overall, I like the product, but it could definitely use some changes - most of all BETTER SOUND QUALITY!!"
3,COULD BE BETTER!!!,"In general, product is good. However, the mirror deserves a best anti-frog treatment (5 out of 10). Radio, although stereo, is not digital, neither the watch. So, tuning is a bit difficult...sound quality is a bit mettalic.After one week with this product, installed inside my shower box, the device is ok.Didn't use the CD player so far.At least, they could offer it in different colors...specially white."
4,cheaper at buy.com,It's cheaper at buy.com ...http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=90134379&loc;=111&sp;=1
2,Leggings?,"Fast shipping, but was not what I was expecting. I thought that these leggings could be used for exercising, but they are more for fashion. Description should detail this."
1,Some serious errors,"At first I gave this book four stars because I found it easy to read and understand, but after reading it I did my research on setting up an S corporation in New York City, then I realized a big error in the very first chapter of the book: it says S corporations are not subject to New York State franchise tax, but this is totally untrue. S corps as well as LLCs are subject to the annual franchise tax of $325 or more. Plus, the book says nothing about after your corporation becomes a federal S corporation, you must also elect New York State S corporation status in order to get tax benefits at the state level.Anyway, the book covers a lot of topics but only very superficially and with other inaccuracies. Also very little information on county-specific issues.I do not recommend this book, for it will mislead you rather than educate you."
2,Content was ok but...,the book fell apart after 1 year :( I gave the book a good read and it sat on the book shelf for about a year. I pulled it back out to check some info and the binding had disintegrated; the pages were all falling out. I contacted the publisher and they said 'too bad... wanna buy the new edition?' Are you F'ing kidding me?!Content-wise it is a satisfactory reference book; kudos to the authors. I will avoid Sphinx publishing in the future; crappy product with NO customer service at all :(
4,"Not a biography, but quite interesting nonetheless","Be aware that if you are looking for a linear, story of the life of Napoleon III sort of book, this is NOT going to do it. If, on the other hand, you have a general interest in Napoleon III and his regime in terms of how the affected social life, literature and politics, this is a very interesting overview of a variety of social realms during the Second Empire. Sort of a tough academic read, but well-done and interesting to the fan of French history or the Napoleons."
4,Really cute and I think it helped,"I got this when we brought home a 10 week old Maltese puppy. I placed the snuggle pup in her crate and I really think it helped. I used the heartbeat and heat just the first night, I dont think it made a difference for her. (which is good since I didnt want to pay for the replacements!) she still sleeps with snuggle pup in her crate. Its really cute, I would definitely recommend it."
5,"Honest, Clean, Christian Humor","I've always been a fan of Dick Van Dyke. So when I recently discovered this book, I had to have it. To put it in one word, Awesome! Honest, clean, Christian humor. I find myself laughing out loud at the stories of childrens simple understanding of biblical principles. On the other hand, some children have a much greater understanding than many adults. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
1,Anthropology is not for any witness,"I wonder how Christians would like a book called ""Anthropology for Muslim Witness"" or ""Anthropology for Hindu Witness""? That is how all anthropologists will feel about this book. Anthropology is not for anybody's ""witness."" It is to witness the diversity of culture and religion itself. Anthropology is not designed or intended to impose one culture or religion on another. In fact, that is the very opposite and antithesis of anthropology. Anthropology is a science and a method for understanding and valuing other cultures on their own terms, not ""witnessing"" your own culture to them. And that is what one's own culture or religion is--just one more culture or religion in the pageant of human cultural and religious diversity. This book is a travesty, as are all such attempts to bastardize anthropology in the service of the most anti-anthropological causes."
2,lesser version of Electrical Storm,"First, note that the ""William Orbit Mix"" of ""Electrical Storm"", a strong song in and of itself, included here is also on 'The Best of 1990-2000' and is the basis for the video. That said, it is inferior to the ""original"" version of the song, which is much more coherent and packs more punch.As for the b-sides, the ""Nice Mix"" of ""New York"" is a version of the original with some added club noises. The ""Nasty Mix"" is a more beefed up instrumental version. Both are disposable as far as b-sides go."
1,Just for collectors,"Nothing special about this CD. I bought it for collection, but if you don't collect, save your money, extra songs are not that great."
1,Don't let the picture and title deceive you,"Very poor performances, sound quality is like AM radio in a bad reception area. Don't waste your money!"
5,My Cute Fajita Grill,My fajita grill is really cute. It's big enough to make fajitas for two people (4 fajitas each) The wood plate looks very elegant compared to the others I saw at Amazon. I gave 5 stars to my grill because the quality is great and the price is right! If you want a great fajita recipe look for Paula Dean's sizzling fajitas at the Food Network's website.
4,cast iron platters,"very happy with the set and the price is the best I could find. great product, great price."
2,Movie shows it's low budget clearly,"The sound track drowned out the interviews with ""known"" comics. No sets from other comics at open mics were shown, as far as I can tell. If you can pick up the movie for less than $5, and you are an open mic comic, it is probably worth it, but definitely not worth buying if you are not a comic."
5,THE CHILEAN TROUBADOUR IS FINALLY HERE!,"Alberto Plaza has been the greatest Chilean singer/songwriter of the last two decades. His music has reached the top of popularity in Latin America and Spain. Several singers have recorded his music. Alberto's songs are a perfect combination of poetry and music. I have followed his career since the very beginning: since ""Que Cante la Vida"" and ""De Tu Ausencia"" until ""Polvo de Estrellas"" and ""Sentencia"" (the latest songs I've been able to get from relatives in Chile) His albums are a must in every music lover's library... Alberto's songs transcend language barriers to become Poetry."
4,"Ah, just like the old days","I'm not sure why this movie wasn't released in U.S. theaters. Yes, it has bad acting (just like his other movies). Yes, it has a bad script (just like his other movies). And anyone who says ""this movie actually has a PLOT"" is kidding themselves. But what this movie has that most of the others didn't was a excellent 1-on-1 fight that turns into another 1-on-1 fight and finally becomes a supurb 2-on-1 fight. This is not some quick little fight, either. It lasts a while. Finally, an ending we can enjoy (no underwater fighting or driving through glass houses). Plus, it has all the classic stunts, action, and great ""I will use any and every object in the room to fight with"" scenes we love.I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. Why not 5? Two reasons. One: I was initally bored with the slow beginning. Two: Drunken Master 2."
3,"A flavorful mix of fun, action, and drama.....Jackie style!!","This film contains a bit of everything in terms of what we Jackie Chan fans have come to expect from the world's greatest. I enjoyed every minute of it, from the opening parachute sequence to the spectacular fight scene on the roof of the office building at the end. Jackie's the one & only!!"
4,Absolutely fantastic fight sequences!,"I really thought the action in the movie was great. The story line, however, was a bit unbelievable. If you left out the scenes where he was adopted and cared for by an African tribe, I would have overlooked the silliness of it. But, the ""clog"" scene and the ""tag team roof battle"" was actually stupendous. The roof fight scene was so good, I had to show it to my friends and family members during my birthday party. Jackie's opponents are absolutely incredible and I wish and hope he continues to showcase such exceptional talent in all of his movies. Great flick and you will have a good time viewing it!"
5,A very entertaining early effort by Jackie Chan,"This movie was thoroughly entertaining. Included a lot of madcap antics by Jackie Chan.Good action film with no graphic violence, no foul language."
4,entertaining,"This is a fine Jackie Chan movie. Not sure what the original language was, but it doesn't really matter. Great story line and awesome fighting scenes with a few interesting twists make this a fine movie."
4,US Film Industry Screws Us Again,"Well, as usual, the US Film Industry screwed us again out of what could have been a great Jackie movie. For some reason, the US Film people think that Americans are incapable of understanding or enjoying the full version of any of Jackie's movies. It has been a frustration of many Jackie fans for YEARS! Scenes cut to save time, also ruin the continuity of the movie. Important scenes are cut to squeeze a movie into that 90 minute time frame. Any of you who have ever seen the Hong Kong versions of ANY of Jackie's movies know what I'm talking about. Many times it changes the mood and meaning of the whole movie. Who Am I? was a good movie, but the HK version is 100% better than the US version. I just wish they would release it the way it was meant to be release...COMPLETE!"
2,The original has been cut so much!,I really like the original movie. But this release has been so much cut. I don't know what was the reason for it. But some really funny scenes (like a lion chasing Jackie) don't show up. Try to find uncut version.
4,great movie,"the acting really blows but who the hell cares really? the martial arts that Mr. Chan presents in this movie will boggle anyone's mind. As everyone has said, the skyscraper scene is awesome. In this scene, Jackie Chan fights two suits, one is a Kung-Fu master and the other is a Tae-Kwon-Do master. They really give Chan one hell of a time while fighting, it's a very entertaining sequence and is by far the best fight in this movie. Buy and enjoy!"
5,Great Movie,I think this movie lives up to Jackie Chan's Movies. Having seen his films since a kid. I've glad that it has arrived in the United States...Although I think that the DVD should have included more languages like Chinese and Spanish. These languages preserve Jackie Chan's true form. Martial Arts At its Best!!!
1,STAY WITH ORIGINAL,"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though."
3,Great fighting scenes,"This had some of the best fighting scenes in Jackie Chan's movies, especially when he had to fight the duo on the roof. Fantastic! The story was too complicated to follow, so that was its weakest point. Another weakness was the typical American over-stereotyped bad guy with the bad accent, hat that nobody wears, and cigar. There seems to be one of these cartoon characters in every Jackie Chan movie and I take it as a direct insult of all Americans. Get that out of there and the movie is much better. I gave it 3 of 5. Without the stupid American, it would receive 4 of 5."
2,One of Jackie's worst.,"I thought Who Am I? would be a great Jackie Chan film just like all the rest. I must say that most of Jackie's films usually do not have an appealing plot at times. But I felt that Jackie Chan slacked of in this film. He did two good scenes and that was the fight scene he has with the two goons in the roof top and when he slides down from one part of the building. As a fan of Jackie's films i felt that this is by far the worst of his craft. I feel that the ""Tuxedo"" is a better film than this. The horrible cgi graphics to the horrible fight scene with the main villian (There is one instant where you obviously see the difference of the actor and a stuntman.) if you're interested in taking a look i suggest renting it."
3,Jackie Chan shine,The story was ok but what's most rememberable about this movie is jackie chan's stunts. There's an awesome fight scene on top of a sky craper. Jackie Chan is a genre of his own
1,Chestnut Nightstand,"Asked for Chestnut and got Brown . Needed it so put it together, top drawer doesn't close all the way. Tried to readjust it but no matter what I do it won't close. Be careful when they say chestnut they mean a full dark brown. Would not order any thing else from them"
5,cool laser,i like this laser. it really looks cool with fog/haze but my recomendation is to get 2 and have the lines crossed with each other that gives more effect. but overall cool item to add to your light show.
4,Cool for kids and adults!,Love this!! Especially when teaching kids and adults to play card that may require a lot of holding!! Plus it shipped quickly!!
2,bulky and too loose,doesn't really hold the cards well at all. bulky and tips over if placed on the table. not very practical for the concept.
2,Dell Axim didn't fit,"I probably should have noticed this, but the Dell will not fit in the cradle if it has an extended life battery. Looks like I'll need to drag out the Dremel to make it work."
2,Too cheap to be true.,"I purchased this product for $9.99 and I definately got what I paid for. I ended up tossing the phone case because it was garbage, I get poor reception with the earpiece but, i have to say, the cigerette lighter charger works great. So if you want a cheap cigerette lighter charger just get this and toss everything else."
3,The Basement,"Although the book became lengthy at times, it was still very scary to read about the specific locations in and around the area. I currently live in Ypsi, next to the house of the first victim and have also been in the basement of John Collins' house which a friend was living in this past year. It's very eerie to know that he actually lived and supposedly killed in that house! I would recommend this book to anyone who knows the area at all."
5,Phenomenal Book,"Having lived 5 doors away from the killers address when I read it, I obviously was engrossed. I read it in a single night and have since re-read it at least 5 times. The book itself is very well written with incredible insights into the what the killer was thinking as well as how, at the same time, law enforcement were trying to counteract his actions. This book has everything, a very intelligent killer who would leave clues to taunt police, renegade investigators who may have cost police the chance to catch the killer red-handed and incredible suspense."
4,Eerie coincidence,"I borrowed the book from a friend who reccommended it because I am a student at the college where it took place. It was well written and I found one strange fact. After talking to soime friends I found out that one of the schools sororities is one of the sites that John Collins used. I delved into the book looking for more information. It provided alot but not what I was looking for. After alittle investigation I found out not only was it a chapterhouse for a local sorority, but MY VERY OWN SORORITY!"
5,It still gives me chills.,"I was a student at EMU just a few of years after these murders happened. It was, and still is, truly chilling to read about the murders and the investigation. When I read ""The Michigan Murders"" for the first time (in hardback) I travelled around Ypsilanti and the surrounding area visiting the various crime scenes. Very, very eerie. I have read many true crime books and Keyes' writing is among the best. As the preceding reviews indicate, this book needs to be reprinted and made available again."
3,Tough to rate,"If I had written this review when I first read this book (about 30 years ago), I would have given it 5 stars. But I was 16 then and more easily impressed. I live in the area of these murders and know all the locations very well. I also know the facts of this string of murders committed between 1967 and 1969 and while Keyes was convinced of the guilt of John Collins in all of these cases, time has proven him to be wrong in at least one case and quite possibly four of the cases. The book is well written and holds the reader's attention especially the search for ""the killer"". The last few chapters tend to bog down on the minutia of the court trial, but overall its a quick read. In summary, crime buffs should enjoy this book as long as they are willing to overlook the somewhat biased POV of the author and realize that this is not all there is to know of these crimes."
5,"Very engrossing, true-life crime story.","I'm in the middle of my 17th read of this book, having first acquired a copy about 10 years ago. I've lost the jacket cover, and the book itself is a bit dog-eared, but it is so well written, and very hard to put down. I gain more insights each time I read it. It must have been a very frightening time for the residents of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Mr. Keyes ties all of the clues and loose ends together extremely well. I have been trying to find out more about the background of John Collins (the murderer), that would cause him to hate young women so much that he would murder seven of them, but have been unable to find anything. I wonder if he is still in jail, or since released. Mr. Keyes, please write a follow-up!!"
4,listing is not clear!!,"I am not really rating the product but the listing of this product. This listing states- bratz rock angels ""BIKE"" and it is not a bike at all it is a SCOOTER! The scooter itself is nice unless you are looking for a bike! Of course had I scrolled down a little further and read the notes from the manufacturer I would have seen this but I would think that an item listed as a bike IS in fact A BIKE!"
5,Manantial,"This CD is fabulous. I don't understand much Spanish, but it doesn't matter: This music transcends language barriers. Listening to this music seems to lift my spirits and is really pleasant after hearing my kids playing obnoxious rap and contemporary U.S. rock bands."
2,Ho-hum.,"A collection of anecdotes from science and historydoes NOT make a scientfic analysis of history. I was a bit annoyed bythe manner in which the author generalised the behaviour of unconcious beings and systems as an description of the behaviour of concious individuals (humans). If the book was billed as a catalog of theories and observations (made by others) of nature and history it might be worth something for its reference section (which is gigantic), except there is not much order in the catalog. For a more rational understanding history and humanity, I would read Ayn Rand."
5,Still the Best,"I see that the Lucifer Principle stirs up quite a few people. I was swept up by it, and so I went and got the book by Becker, The Denial of Death, extolled by one of Bloom's critics. The first 20 or so pages were great, but the rest was repetitious and emotional without a clear focus. Also, the book had a dated feel to it, sort of like bell-bottom pants and tie-dyed t-shirts... I still say, haven't seen a better, more wide-reaching and bracing book on the human condition than the Lucifer Principle in at least a decade of reading and thinking..."
3,A fine bit of semi-science,"""The Lucifer Principle"" is indeed a thought-provoking read but not for the reasons the author intended. One of the hallmarks of rigorous science is the examination of alternative hypotheses and the subsequent rejection of those that fail. Bloom offers only one hypothesis (memes) and supporting evidence but fails to examine alternative views (such as Jared Diamond's proposals in ""Guns, Germs, and Steel""). As a consequence, I can't help feeling that I've only heard a small part of the story. For example, Bloom disregards the possibility of economic ideological ""conquest"" entirely.""The Lucifer Principle"" is well written and entertaining but fails to convince."
1,Typical Sociological Pseudoscience,"Typical sociological pseudoscience. Bloom mocks physicians and scientists unless it promotes his own agendas, atheism,and evolution. He stands by Alexander the Great's massacres as fact, but the resurrection and deity of Christ a figment of the imagination. Another atheist who hates God and his laws. Note there aren't books proclaiming Santa Claus as imagined, because it doesn't stir up the feelings of hatred that God does. If He truly doesn't exist why write about it, why not treat Him like the Easter Bunny. The truth is they do on some level believe, and the hatred comes pouring out."
5,A highly recommended masterpiece on what it's all about.,"This book will definately replace most ideas many people have grown up with. It shows and explains the nature of our behaviour in a way most of us would not like to see. Mr. Bloom proves his ideas by giving us, sometimes astounding, examples which should not be taken personally by anyone, numerous examples can be found in daily life. His explanations are logical, clear and hard to deny. It will make some of us feel uncomfortable. Don't blame Mr. Bloom. He's just the messenger."
5,Will make you THINK!,"Mr. Bloom presents a new way of looking at just about everything from history, science, and religion to stress and even poetry. He strings together such disparate threads as self-organizing systems, ancient history, memetics, and primate studies in order to show that the real meaning behind our actions may not be what we idealists would like to think. I've read the criticism the book has gotten from some muslims, but the muslim Sufis wrote a thousand years ago that mankind has yet to truly become human. One of the big ideas the book hit me with is that we're still largely acting on our animal wiring (but I don't see that as inescapable). The Lucifer Principle will not please everybody: Mr. Bloom is an American, and a keen-eyed one concerned with the survival of his superorganism."
3,"Worth reading, but with a discerning eye...","This book is certainly an enjoyable read, however there are some problems with Bloom's conclusions. He supports his bold theory with piece-meal evidence from historical anecdotes taken completely out of context. While his facts seem to be accurate and well researched, some of his conclusions are based wholly on conjecture and personal bias. This is not to say that I did not agree with Bloom on some points, but I think his ""scientific approach"" leaves much to be desired. Further, his conclusion that the Islamic culture is in fact a ""killer culture"" is a little disturbing to me. My only fear is that some readers, who are looking to justify their hatred of certain groups, will use parts of Bloom's theory to justify their beliefs. Having said that, I would recommend the book, but with the admonition to maintain a healthy skepticism, which is necessary when reading virtually anything."
1,A tribute to the boundless errors of inductive reasoning !,"Beware . . unwary reader, Mr. Blooms arguements, statements, and position, are smoke and mirrors. His use of language is brilliant. But his reasoning is not. He repeatedly takes a given incident and uses it to create a statistic to prove a point. Similarly, years from now, someone of his mind, might read an article about the Minendez brothers and conclude that all children in the 20th century, upon reaching maturity, brutally killed their parents. And further might even conclude it was a right of passage etc. PUL-EEASE! The book is extremely well written, but it is FICTION."
2,Wait for the paperback and then don't buy it,"What we have instead of science are antecdotes thatBloom claims exemplify a law of history. Conjecture isn'tproof, however, and even a casual reader will see thatfor every of Bloom's examples are counter examples.Moreover, some antecdotes are clearly twisted to fitBloom's theses, and this detracts from the book's credibility.In a nutshell, interesting theses supported by whollyinadequate evidence"
1,As shallow as it can get.,"The author is surprisingly shallow. Although the initial idea is good (selfish genes & memes and society as a super organism) the examples, parallels, and the whole arguments are weak and unsubstantial when he came down to the facts.It's hardly a work of a professional."
1,Best avoid,"The Lucifer principle is a particulary dishonest and odious effort to discredit entire peoples and cultures as intrinsically evil. The arguments employed are artificial and pseudo-scientific, but what can one expect from a writer who lists among achievements management of Kiss rockstar Gene Simmons. In targetting certain cultures, especially the Arab-islamic one, the author reveals his own ethnic bias. Bloom adresses himself to the average American, the best and most innocent of people of course, but therefore also gullible and easily misled, so they are warned that they must have no mercy in dealing with these evil peoples. In Abu Ghraib prison we see that this advice did not fall on deaf ears. There we have Blooms proof of the innocence of the Americans and their determination eradicate evil people. In sum, avoid this piece of hate literature."
2,Save your money!,"It's easier to go through life just existing, rather than to know that opinions like Bloom's can be so distorted and warped."
5,Doesn't Disappoint,I love just picking up this book and reading a single chapter. I learn so much and look at things a little differently from what Bloom says. Its addicting.
3,"Anecdotal Evidence does not ""Science"" make","Bloom relies on somewhat spurious anecdotes to make his case that organisms have a genetic code that drives them toward social competition, rather than simply individual competition. If he were able to argue his case, rather than attempt to persuade us through the use of well-removed anecdotes from history and biology, then he might have convinced me. In fact, I'm not at all certain whether or not he is wrong or right. He simply fails to convince.The material is interesting, but the format grows tiresome, as he makes his argument in one or two paragraphs of each chapter and then relies on some historical vignette for the other 80-90% of the text. By the time you have reached 50 repetitions of this format, it is likely you too will have grown as weary of this book as I have become. And you will be only half way through!"
5,A must read,In light of our recent terrorist attacks this may be the only book that will answer the question WHY?. This is a must read for every American with intellectual inquisitive pursuits!
2,Non-scientific collection of mildly interesting opinions,"Pretty well-writen assortment of opinons, based upon what seems to be a pretty large base of written material. However, this book is definitely NOT what it seems by reading the back of it: this is Bloom's version of reality. He cannot prove any of it, nor, it seems, does he really want to take the time to do so. This book is an interesting read for people who are entertained by opinions of fellow amateur non-academic (or even anti-academic) intellectuals."
1,A triumph of shoddy scholarship over critical thinking,"A superficial rehash of the ideas of others supported by overgeneralization from haphazardly selected studies. If you have an interest in evolutionary psychology, memes, or the relationship of the individual to the ""superorganism"" there are so many other (and much better) books that are well-researched and thought out. The extensive reference list provides the appearance of scholarship and comprehensiveness, but the reader should be aware that this is illusory at best. If you are a nascent social Darwinist looking for rhetoric with which to back up your arguments, this may be the book for you. But if you want to learn something about evolution and the modern mind, seek out the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at UC Santa Barbara, and read Richard Dawkins, David Buss, Steven Pinker, and Robert Wright."
5,An astonishing foray into the forces that shape history,"The Lucifer Principle is absolutely must reading for anyone who wants to understand racism, violence and war. Bloom has made a remarkable contribution to both cultural anthropology and politics. Military leaders, politicians, police and educators should be required to read The Lucifer Principle as a matter of survival training.This book also provides a highly salutary alternative to the ghastly public psycho/social philosophy that has been concocted by the American academic community over the past 75 years. Our modern social sciences do not adequately address either the issue of male violence or the problem that a viceless educational climate creates for young people. Bloom has sketched out the basis for a social philosophy that takes into account our genetic proclivities and limitations. Any society that does not address the genetic and memetic issues that Bloom brings up is doomed to repeat history--endlessly."
3,Folks...anecdotal evidence does not science make,"The book is interesting and I even agree with much of it. For example, pecking orders certainly exist as do superorganisms (I feel their weight every day at work!). However, why should I believe that people commit suicide out of concern for the good of the superorganism? Also, while superorganisms are certainly a factor, why should I believe it is THE dominant factor that the author claims it to be? This isn't science as the author claims it to be. Howard, at least offer up some notion as to how we go about testing your hypothesis. I give the book three stars because it is an entertaining read, but can't give it more than that since it is merely an opinion piece, and not the science the author claims."
3,Sociobiology and orginal sin.,"The world can be saved only by the puritan ethic and space exploration. Most of the book seems sensible but irritating. With research as anecdote, lots of documentation that doesn't prove anything, and not a single mathmatical formula in the whole book, it is more an exercise in rhetoric and name dropping than in science, but it does have some good ideas: that we are not as different from other animals as we like to think and that our actions are more controlled by our biology than we realize."
4,Interesting book,"Perhaps Bloom is one-sided in his analysis of ""Killer Cultures"" like Islam etc. There are numerous examples of barbarous actions by the other side of the coin too (Christianity for one), some that are much more fascinating because of their blatant hipocrisies. But an intelligent reader will not only recognize this, but will actually conjure up his own bloody examples, at the very thought of ""Killer Cultures"". The analysis of man as an instinctively aggressive being was fascinating. For myself, I instantly thought of another the American Civil War, and its ""Killer Angels"". The horror one can extract one human being on another is amazing and Bloom explores some of those roots. This book starts the thought process and encourages you to think on these levels. It's not complete, nor is it apparently all-encompassing, but it is provoking and entertaining. That's what good books are for."
1,Gratuitous Racism,"Dickinson engages in gratuitous racism to make the employees of the British Royal Family sound as though they were still in the 1920s or 1930s. Since the book was written in 1976 and takes place in that time period, there is no cause to use the N-word. I dislike the casual racism of British authors, but it is particularly bad when someone like Dickinson does it to show off. I am assuming that the fact that he grew up in Zimbabwe has nothing to do with this. I am disappointed in Felony and Mayhem, whose republishing I like, put up with this. They should know better."
3,Royal pain,"Interesting idea for a history/mystery -- a contemporary British royal family (not the current Windsor bunch) with a big secret that sets off a spiral of practical jokes, ending in murder. The story is narrated by a precocious 13-year Princess Royal, who is also the principal sleuth and mystery-solver.This novel has its moments, but mostly it sputters along without much edge to it and with a lack of real depth to the characters involved. When the murder mystery is finally solved, the perpetrator'(s) motivations are far from convincing. In fact, they are not even very interesting.""King and Joker"" is one of the ""archival"" mysteries resurrected by Felony and Mayhem Publishers which has generally brought back to the market some terrific novels by first-rate writers. This title is one of their occasional flops, in my opinion."
2,Read the Sequel,"I looked around to find King and Joker because I had so much enjoyed the sequel, Skeleton-in-Waiting. I was disappointed with it and agree with another reviewer that it is slow-moving and rather unconvincing, motivation-wise. If you can find Skeleton, I think you'll prefer it to the first mystery."
3,An eventful New Year,"During the New Year's Eve break when Imspector Morse was supposed to be on leave, a body was discovered in the bedroom of a local hotel which had held a special holiday function in the form of a fancy dress dance and dinner. Morse and Sergeant Lewis were called in to investigate the murder of a guest at the dinner, whose head had been smashed in with a heavy object, but when the names and addresses of all the attending guests were checked out, it appeared that not only had this guest but several others given false names and addresses. As the guests had not been detained before the arrival of the police, a hunt began for the occupants of the rooms who had obviously been there with ""significant others"" who were not their legal spouses. The reader needs to concentrate closely to unwind the tangled web which follows but if this is possible, it's an intriguing read with Morse being his usual arrogant, boozy self and with poor Lewis being the fall guy for his sarcastic wit."
3,Not Dexter's best effort,"A good read, but this mystery is not up to the author's standards. The dialogue was not as humorous and imaginative, especially between Morse and Lewis, as it was in previous novels. For some reason the characters come off a little flat in this book. The plot suffers a little as well - just not the usual Dexter potboiler."
3,Solid Morse,This book features a solid mystery and good characterization. This is not the best Morse book (although it is better than some of the early ones) but it isn't the worst either. Dexter has a feel for making crime compelling.
4,The True King Of Rock'n'Roll,"Forget Elvis , This is the real king of Rock'n'Roll. Knew his instrument inside out, had the the ability to write truly memorable songs and masterfully entertained crowds as demonstrated on the live tracks on this album. Truly unforgettable. Johnny B. Goode really rings My Ding-a-Ling!!!!!!"
4,Really nice studio and live CD,"The live ""Reelin'"" and ""Goode"" are hot, and the studio tracks are what you have grown to expect from Chuck. All in all, a really nice CD from the master."
4,This is a Diamond,"Classic LP.........Chuck is the founder of guitar rock and really the first true singer songwriter......for those complaining about my ding-a-ling....Chuck is a notorious naughty man....just skip it, but don't knock it....its rock and roll and it should be fun and light at times. There was a rumor that this was supposed to be a double album...SO POWERS THAT BE ARE YOU LISTENING? Just like the Howlin Wolf Deluxe edition of the london sessions.......how about it? Maybe release the full concert (clearly Chuck is ON that night) and more studio stuff! I will buy it!"
3,If you are curious about...,"the 11 minute version of ""My Ding A Ling"", why? The live version of ""Reelin' and Rockin'"" is the underrated gem on this album.""MDAL"" is an embarrasment to listen to and I hope all of the people that pushed it to #1 are forced to listen to it for their eternity.After everything Chuck did for rock'n'roll why did we have to hear ""MDAL"" ?"
3,Gentle practice but not inspiring,"This video leads the viewer through a gentle kundalini practice. It is a great beginner video. The teacher is kind and beautiful in her yoga. However, I found both the setting and the teacher to be somewhat lifeless and uninspiring. While I find myself wanting the more gentle practice that this video offers, I still will reach for Gurmukh's more aerobic video because I am more inspired by the joy and love that eminates from Gurmukh while being surrounded by the lush, vibrant setting of Hawaii."
2,$43 PRICE IS RIDICULOUS!!!,"I have this in VCR tape form and simply wanted to buy it again in DVD form, but the $43.00 price is ridiculous. Most yoga DVDs are $7.99 to $14.99. The price would have to come WAY DOWN for me to consider re-buying it!! For that reason, I am giving this a bad review. If you want people to experience a good kundalini class, you must make it accessible for the average person's ability to pay for it."
1,Not your usual yoga and too abrupt sequences,"This DVD ranked at the lowest of my list of DVDs seen so far.The Yoga asanas are the normals ones seen or followed by any format.It jumps right into reverse back bends, quick breathing and so on. Beware of the abrupt sequences. Even for an advance yoga student\teacher, I would suggest doing the stretching on their own before using this.I would put it in the category: Do not buy this to stretch and to follow Yoga as an exercise. Buy it or any Kundalini Yoga DVD to try and awaken your Kundalini. For others, find something else.Level: Advanced (As a second session)Instructions: SpokenModifications: Shown separately. Only one practitionerLocation: StudioDuration: ~45 minutes"
1,Couldn't get past the annoying voice...,"I may be shallow and judgmental, but I just could NOT get past the annoying voice of the instructor, and especially could not look at Carol Carlson as a professional, credible, literate instructor when she mispronounces ""especially"" as ""ekspecially"" (twice!) and misuses ""radiance"" for ""radius."" Something just happened to me inside when I heard those words, and I knew I never wanted to watch the video again. I'm with the people who criticized her voice as annoying and monotone, and the ""Sat nam, sat nam, sat nam"" really got on my nerves. I would not recommend this to anyone. ... I could have gotten a Kundalini instructor who knew how to speak English correctly! I guess I have just gotten very, very picky about what I spend my money on, and when I buy a professionally done instructional video, I expect to be instructed by someone who can speak properly."
1,Really annoying instructor and difficult workout,"I found the instructor incredibly annoying and kept wishing she would stop talking. I found her ""affirmations"" inane and repetitive, with not enough instruction on the techniques. She starts with a backbend pose, in the midst of which she stops and explains in detail how to do breath of fire! In all my classes we have started out with less strenuous stretching positions. I also didn't feel the workout flowed well from one position to the next."
2,"decent workout, weird energy","While this kundalini workout is somewhat challenging, the teacher gives off a weird Branch Davidian-like energy which makes following her instructions a little uncomfortable. She takes the workout SO seriously, never once cracks a smile or says anything remotely light hearted or humorous. She almost seems bitter. In short, this tape isn't nearly as much fun as the kundalini tape by Gurmukh, who emits warmth, strength and wisdom throughout."
2,Challenging but disorganized...?,"I found the actual poses to be good, difficult Kundalini practice though perhaps a bit disorganized. They (the poses)didn't seem to go in a logical order for where the body happened to be placed at a given time. The instructor was learned but devoid of any child-like good naturedness that yoga is supposed to proliferate."
4,I like this one.,"There are many different types of yoga and yoga routines. Vinyasa, which is great at building muscle, isn't for everyone. I like the cardio on this DVD, and I like the gentle ""meditations"" between sets of exercises. I feel extremely energized afterwards. It's a good practice for people who are intimidated by difficult poses. However, if you prefer a more regimented or athletic style, this one is not for you."
5,Kundalini Yoga with Grace and Strength,"This is by far one of the best yoga videos I've ever done. It is challenging enough to hold my interest, but at the same time, leaves me feeling completely serene and grounded by the end. I have yet to tire of doing it and Carol is a wonderful example of what yoga should be."
1,a yoga instructor from NY,"I am a certified Prana Yoga Instructor (based on Kripalu Yoga) and I recently discovered Gurmukh's Kundalini Yoga tape, which I think is wonderful. In my quest to learn more about Kundalini Yoga I ordered this Carol Carlson video. After no more than 10 minutes into this tape I had to turn it off. What is she thinking to do a backbend with breath of fire as her first asana, with no options for modifications for beginners or people with shoulder, wrist or back issues....and even for advanced students no warm up??? I could not go on I was so annoyed at her. I found her tone condecending and annoying. Yoga students seeking an energizing, revitalizing, life changing experience should try Gurmukh or Ravi Singh, both instructors present the practice from a place of love and healing, yet the work outs are physically challenging."
3,A Good Introduction To Kundalini Yoga,"Having never tried this type of yoga before, I found Carol Carson to be low key, yet her calmness helped me to remain calm during the sometimes taxing breath of fire. For those not familiar with yoga and especially with breathing techniques, I think this tape may be difficult to follow. I did feel wonderfully alive when I finished the practice."
4,Grace and Strength an apt title,"I am a relative beginner to yoga, and have used two tapes. Grace and Strength with Carol Carlson and Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh. Carol Carlson is serious, energetic, and unaffected. Her straightforwardness was attractive as it countered the stereotypes I had harbored about yoga practice. As a New Yorker I liked her no nonsense style very much. The workout could be said to be difficult, but this was no problem as I usually rest during the last bits of each exercise.Her thoroughly engaging seriousness and lack of affectation allowed me in and opened me up to other styles that I would have shunned. Gurmukh is such an example, who's style and voice at first seems nothing less than flaky-but who turns out to be just as serious and unaffected as Carlson. But, without the entrée' provided by Carlson, I never would've gotten past minute one of Gurmukh. Both tapes complement one another perfectly. I use them both regularly."
5,best diaper ointment,"I know some people may not agree with our method, but it works like a charm. We put A&D on our son every time we change him and he has only had 1 diaper rash in 6 months! The only reason he even had one was because he had a horrible reaction to sweet potatoes. I know it may sound expensive to use A&D every time, but realistically I've only used one of the containers every four months, so its not too bad and I've found that it is cheaper to buy to two tubes and just refill my big container whenever needed. Hope this helps someone out there!"
5,Great ointment - immediate effect,"My babies and I love it!It's a great product, very recommended.It relieves pain immediately!When ever my baby's got a rash etc. I put on some ointment and it vanishes!"
4,It's ok,"The item is very good, just that the presentation si different from the showing pic, and the texture is diferent that the tube."
4,Great for many purposes,I use A+D ointment not only for diaper rashes but also for small cuts and burns. I bought this 1 lb jar almost one year ago (when my son was born) and I may have used only about 15% of the total content. I should probably have bought a smaller jar...
5,"These Songs for You, Live!","A legend who left this world too soon. Thank goodness his live recordings are being released so that those who love real musical genius & talent can somehow feel that we are there while Donny serenades us.If you have a Donny collection, then some of the songs you already know like: Flying Easy, Someday We'll All Be Free and You've Got A Friend but treats are his covers of Superwoman & Yesterday (and an interview at the end of the disc).I'd highly recommend this disc if you are a serious fan looking to add to your collection AND if you are merely curious about Donny Hathaway, this is a good collection of his songs to begin to familiarize yourself with his music."
1,didnt arrive,the itens i purchased via amazon didnt arrive to my place to this day.who should i complaind with?
3,OK,I didn't enjoy this as much as I did the greatest hits collections. Only his very popular songs worked for me.
2,Great concept; not ideal execution,This book would have been wonderful had it been published in a larger format. This 9 by 6 size presents photographs which are too small and dark. I would have gladly paid more for larger prints in a glossy finish.
4,Great Book!,"A good and informative book. Just looking through it I learned a few things that I hadn't ever heard or noticed before, such as the way that tightlacing of corsets doesn't seem to have been too common before the late 1860s.The book is very reasonably priced. The only trouble, which probably, were it to be fixed, would make the book cost a lot more, is that I often wish the photographs were printed in better quality."
2,Skip This One.,"There is a poor organization of the material which results in great redundancy between chapters, and worst, a fast run over important material. As example, the Battle of The Bulge is covered at nauseas in several chapters, while the Marianas Turkey Shoot gets seconds of coverage. Also the narration is rushed, barely in sync with the video show, and poorly supported with maps."
2,very cheesy 1950s documentary,"bought this item hoping it would be like the shows you see on the history channel about the history of ww2, after watching the first two discs its apparent that this series is at least 30 years old. It reminds me of watching old science movies in class. the graphics they have are a picture and yard stick for goodness sakes!"
3,Incomplete documentary of the War,"Lacks adequate description of the Eastern Front. Biographies are superfluous and should have been eliminated for "" the last days of WWII"" History Channel documentary"
4,WWII DVD set,I purchased this set for one of my grandchildren and liked it so much that I bought another one for another grandchild.
5,Great!!!,"My son loves Dragon Ball Z. There were no Blemishes on the disc, which is a great plus. The game is great for kids play."
4,I love it,"I love the game. The graphics are in keeping with true DBZ form and the concept of it all and extra features make it very interesting but, if it lacks anything it would be the lack of adult design. It sounds (both the music and especially the dialogue) like something for children when more than half of the DBZ fan base have already grown to young adulthood or older. It needs a more adult feel without compromizing the purity of the game play so that older and younger can fully enjoy it."
1,F*** you,The Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 game that you sent me didnt work. It was scratched beyond belief.. your lucky that I have a great disk cleaner and after putting it through four times I finally got it to work.. I was extremly pissed.. thanks.
1,TOTAL JIP,this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at ALL!! i hate this game so MUCH!! it is literally the worst DBZ game i have ever played {and i have played them all) i advise you if ur looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!!!
5,A lot of fun!,"This is according to my 14-year-old son, who has a lot of experience with Dragonball Z games and got this one for Christmas:""I like the variety of attack skills and the awesome graphics as I fly through realistic lands! There are enough characters to last a long time, and it takes a long time to beat this game."""
5,Polkinghorne -- perhaps the best!,"So many good things to say about John Polkinghorne's writings! For Christians who are not afraid to think, this one is a winner."
1,not enough information,"I wish there was a bit more information available to me about this product, the fact that this product is only 2.99 is a mute point. I have no idea what it is or isn't capable of based on what is currently being posted."
3,more details ... please!,i'm from an educational institution and we're looking for typing softwares for grade 4 to 8. i find this typing software interesting because of its price and the comments given by some customers. Can you please secure me additional information on how to purchase this software. Can we avail a classroom package (45-50 users) and don't forget the price quotation. thanks!
1,I wouldn't Buy This if I Were You,"I haven't bought this product but if it is three dollars so I don't think it will be that great of a product. But who knows, you know what they say, ""Never judge a book by its Cover."" Thank you very much for your time and I hope you fou this helpful."
3,Too much live performance,Wished for old recordings from other albums . Whilst live is good the studiowork was better . Still worth listening to.
2,"Not very insightful, for someone with very limited dating/social skills","I bought it cause I consider myself pretty shy. I have trouble asking girls out from time to time and stuff. However this is something you can just overcome on your own, with dedication and practice. At least not with much from this book, unless, like I said you have barely any experience at all.To be honest I put the book down one quarter of the way through and haven't read it since. Too much common sense and obvious suggestions here."
1,not so inspiring so far,"i don't like the many ""success"" stories of people meeting in bars. i hate bars and i hate people who become alcoholics together."
1,VB 6.0,Items that are discontinued or not in stock are still being peddled. Items should not be featured if the customer does not have the opportunity to purchase them. This site is wasting my time by offering items that are unavailable.
3,best version of Electrical Storm,"If you have not purchased the b-sides version of 'The Best of 1990-2000', then this disk - which includes the ""original"" version of ""Electrical Storm"" is a must. The ""William Orbit Mix"" (which is the basis for the video and is the version on the cd-single part 1 and 'The Best of 1990-2000') is much more ambient and incoherent. By contrast, the original version has the punch in the chorus that the metaphorical electrical storm demands.As for the live versions of ""Bad/40/Where the Streets Have No Name"", note that these are definitely not the best versions of these songs and these versions are available on the ""Elevation Live in Boston"" DVD."
4,One of the bestest bread crumbs around,"I have been using Ian's bread crumbs, Italian style, for years and love the product. When I saw them on Amazon and for half of what I have been paying I jumped at the chance to purchase.I will stay with Ian's as long as they produce it and shop Amazon.com, neat stuff."
4,"Good, but not needed","It is a really neat book, but I haven't used it once in my Chemistry 161 class and she said that we didn't need it..."
4,ms. bear,This video was a pleasant surprise. All children ages 4 through 10 who are animal lovers will thouroughly enjoy this family film. This is very light-hearted family entertainment which teaches compassion for animals and their young. Parents of girls will especially enjoy this film since the main characters are sisters. Go girl power!
1,disaster,this film is a disaster. i feel sorry for all those involved. the only good work was done by the animal trainer.
5,Inspirational Product,"The Hillsongs Group have a wonderful gift. There voices are remarkable and I admire their intentions of worship and praise. I heard a few of the tracks before I bought the DVD but seeing the live concert was the icing on the cake. I would recommend anyone to purchase this product. I watch and listen to it on most mornings because it fills me with inspiration and a happy feeling, the feeling and belief that God is in Contol. Really nice DVD....."
5,Authentic Worship!,"I have the ""God He Reigns"" CD and the DVD and all I can say is I'm glad I bought both. The Hillsong worship camp has done it again! God He Reigns is a powerful live recording featuring Darlene Zschech, Reuben Morgan, Joel Houston, a 500 voice choir, and audience of thousands! What you'll see is a fast paced visuals of hands praising and a call to worship resonating across the projector screens as a thunderous music echoes throughout the Sydney Entertainment Center. And you wish yourself among them. I listen to it pretty much every day, and use it to worship God during my morning quiet time. You won't be disappointed with it. I promise! :-)"
3,perhaps a dfferent version,"I write only to say that the DVD I received is only 1 disc. Our drummer had ordered his from Hillsong direct and his DVD was a 2 disc set with the second containing a bit where the guitarists do an instructional showing how they play several songs and the effects and settings they use to get thier sounds.The DVD I got from Amazon doesn't contain a second disc, there isn't even a place for a second disc, So it is not as if my particular copy was somehow shorted. It seems to be a second version of the DVD package that only contains 1 disc. I did not see any distinction of a 1 disc version and a 2 disc version mentioned online, [maybe I just missed it] but IF you are expecting a 2 disc version, you may not get it. Perhaps that is the reason the DVD is cheaper here....dave"
1,Buy the CD instead!,"What a waste this was! The music on this album is great, but the editing on this dvd made me sick. It's very similar to watching MAN ON FIRE, the scenes cut continuously and you never get into the concert. I have all their dvds and they are all great, but this one is terrible. Very disappointed!!"
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I'm unable to use this product due to it being the wrong item. I misunderstood the write up & ordered this product erronously. It's not for the XBox 360 it's just for XBox so I'm unable to use it. I tried to return but the seller is unable to take it back since it was opened. The seller notified me that Amazon would only give me 50% credit & being that it cost $100, I decided to keep it & try to find someone with an XBox that will be able to use it."
3,Why include the Classics?,"Considering that a Remixes/Rarities cd by definition would appeal primarily to diehard fans, and considering that diehard De La fans already own all their studio releases, I can't understand why this cd includes prereleased album versions of any of their songs. The remixes and rarities make this worth it for de la junkies, but you'll have to weed through the stuff you know, even rip/burn a new copy without the prereleased stuff, to get to the treasure..."
5,must read if intrested in zoology or evolution,an excellent book. although alot of parts may be hard to understand it is relatively easier than the unabridged version.get this if your intrested in biology
3,Intense,"Intense heavy guitars, and the vocals are mostly yelled. Not just a single singer like hardcore; the whole bunch of them yell together. At times dark, but at other times almost jubilant sounding, but still yelling. Awesome stuff for when you're in a mood for intense, in-your-face sound."
3,Talking Heads speak,This compilation would be awesome were it not for the many skips and starts. It has all the best Talking Heads classics. 18 cuts! All danceable. Just one of the best rhythm sections ever. Love it! But my purchase was diminished by the poor quality of the disc. It had probably been played way too many times. A good and bad sign.
4,nice cd,"i dont know all the albums of talking heads,but all songs are good , i recomend the cd for a begginer of knowing the band"
3,Only for the casual TH fan - many crucial songs missing?!,"This is just another cash-in from WB on the Heads' back catalog - how can you call this ""the best of"" Talking Heads when it glaringly omits some of the BEST songs EVER, namely BORN UNDER PUNCHES and CROSSEYED AND PAINLESS from the bands' BEST album ever, REMAIN IN LIGHT? Sure these weren't pop-radio friendly hits, but they are essential to the scope/understanding of the Heads' signature sound, exploration, and growth! This is more like a singles collection - so if you need that, fine by me, but I won't be getting this. Nice cover, though."
4,"This collection is ""Heaven"".","What can you say about the ""Talking Heads""? One of the most creative and unique bands of their time, in whatever genre they're in, with a sound all their own, and love by anyone with a cool taste in music. This is a pretty sweet disc. It includes all the big hits like ""Burning Down The House"", ""Psycho Killer"", ""Once In A Lifetime"", and ""And She Was"", plus the great tracks ""Building On Fire"", ""(Nothing But) Flowers"", ""Wild Wild Life"", and ""This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)"". Also their great cover of ""Take Me To The River"" is on here. There's obviously some great songs missing, but if you need more you can get the 2-disc collection ""Popular Favorites 76-92/Sand In The Vasoline"", which of course is twice as good."
4,adequate,Most best of albums suffer from lousey mixes. The tracks on this one sound like the ones on the original albums.
5,Love it,"I'm a big fan of ""Greatest Hits"" compilation disks. There's a lot of artists out there that I like enough to buy a collection of their best stuff, but not enough to buy ALL their stuff.So, if you're just kind-of a Talking Heads fan, this is a great disk to buy. Only half-serious about that comment. It's a great disk, as far as I can tell, it has all the ""radio hits"" on it, and quite a bit more, actually, a lot more for a single disk. To me, this disk reads like something that is intended to be ""sure you like THOSE songs, but listen to THESE OTHERS, and if you like THEM, maybe you'd like to pick up the full albums?"". To me, that's a great way to set up a disk, and the Talking Heads disk does that."
4,18 songs for 5.99,"I'm not crazy about all their songs but they have a few that I love. This 'best of"" had at least six of my favorites so it was worth 5.99 for 18 songs."
3,Nostalgia,Nice to hear some pop music from the seventies. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven.
2,Review of Talking Heads C.D.,"This isn't the time to be stocking up on ""talking heads"" recordings. The recording was a disappointment. I would not encourage a friend to buy another ""heads"" recording."
1,Disappointed,"This documentary is not very in-depth and was not made very well. It seemed to be made in a hurry as there are some obvious mistakes and was not made with much detail. Only a few schools across the country are represented, so I don't see how that reflects the title, Friday Nights in AMERICA, indicating that schools across the entire country would be discussed. Overall I was very disappointed."
4,Bookworm's treasure,"Simply put, this is an excellently written book! Oh true the first page or three is a bit clunky, but after that, the book absolutely takes off! The characters are well fleshed-out, the world is vibrant and real. And the interactions between the five main characters are an absolute hoot sometimes! There are also plenty of moments where I wondered how the characters possibly survived what they went through. Everything just draws the reader in further. I had to pick up the second book just to see what happens next!This is definitely a good addition for any reader's personal library!"
5,Amazing Product,"Amazing product. I have tried pretty much every brand of shake, vitamin, creatine, thermogenic, fish oil, test booster, etc, etc, and this ranks at the top of the health list and ""feel good"" list. I know it sounds a little too good to be true, but I can feel the difference within minutes of drinking this product. It's like it's refreshing my body and giving me the nutrients I need. Btw, I do intense workouts, crossfit, mma, cardio 5 days per week and this gets me through the tough workouts. I drink it in the morning or about an hour before workout. Quit being cheap and buy the soy shake. You can't put a price on health and feeling good, because your life will be better and you should be able to work harder and longer by taking this product. It's awesome!"
1,"Alive! Soy Ultra-Shake Vanilla, 2.2 lbs Powder","I've used powders for years and this was the worst flavor and smell that I have ever tasted. It was something I will never purchase again, I sure wish I could return this product. Will never purchase anything from this company again!"
2,High on sugar and sticky,I did not like this product. The sugar content is very high. Expect to add weight and bloat up if you take this frequently. Also lumps get stuck on blender blades and side walls of blender jar. It does not mix well in fruit smoothie. I have tried different types of blender (emersion etc.) but same result. I don't even put as much as recommended serving size on the box. So end up wasting a lot of it in the process.
5,Stay alive,"Stop looking around , This is the best you can get yourself, it got it allIt's amazing .the vanilla taste weird in the beginning , just add a little it of sugar and enjoy it"
2,Too much sugar,"Too much sugar. I feel tired within 25 minutes. Might be the soy too... because soy alters the thyroid metabolism, as in slowing it down. This product got an undesireable review on Consumer Lab (independent) for having an unaccepatable amount of lead. It does have a pleasant taste but that's it."
3,"Healthy, but gross if you don't like healthy things","I don't like vegetables, so am terrible at eating them, and while I like fruit, don't eat it enough. I thought this would be a great nutritional supplement. First off the scoop size is about a quarter cup, which is a lot for 8oz of milk. Second of all, it tastes weird. I added half a scoop to 8oz of milk, then poured it over my honey nut cheerios. I figured vanilla milk would just make my cereal taste better, but it doesn't really taste very vanilla like. It definitely has a healthy taste to it, which isn't horrible, but definitely not enjoyable. If you really want to add a little health to your day, I think it's great. If you want something that tastes awesome, no."
2,It does NOT mix instantly.,"Despite what it says on the label this product will not mix without a blender. Luckily this same weekend I purchased a blender. Even so, this is not the most delicious tasting thing. It is definitely an acquired taste which doesn't motivate me to use it (as I have to buy an insane amount of veggies and fruits to blend with it--additional cost.) I am totally sure this is entirely healthy but I would much rather stick to a multi-vitamin pill over this."
1,DISGUSTING!,It may save my life from all sorts of diseases but would have killed me by shear BAD TASTE! I mixed this with everything under the sun and IT STILL HAD 'I WANT TO THROUGH UP TASTE!!!'
1,Not a soy shake,"I found the description of the product misleading from what I actually received. The product name is listed as soy ultra shake, and I assumed this was a soy shake, it is not - it is a vegetable shake with soy protein added. There is little to no vanilla flavor,, it is overpowered by the vegetable flavor. The product does not have ""soy"" in the name, rather it is a whole food energizer ultra shake vanilla flavor"" with a small box at the top that says "" soy protein"".If you are looking for a vegetable based shake with vegetable flavor (and by the way, when mixed turns into a green shake that I could not drink from a clear glass due to the color) you may be happy with this shake. If you are looking for a soy shake that is vanilla flavored, keep looking, this is not it."
2,"It maybe healthy, but it is not tastey","I bought he Apple-Cinnamon flavor of this product and the taste was so amazing, even in water that I thought I would try the vanilla as well. That was a big mistake. There is very little vanilla flavor in this and you end up tasting more all the other stuff they put into it. Though I feel this is the best multivit shake out there, I reccomend you stay away from this flavor."
5,ok,"This is the first time i have used this product, mixed it with soy milk, it was green, but did not taste too bad, have only used it a few times."
1,Poor excuse for a water bottle,I've owned this bottle for a few months and it already has severals cracks around the mid-section. The bottle still leaks even if I fill water below the cracks. Definitely not a convinient squeeze-type bottle. NOT RECOMMENTED.
1,Merda,"É uma verdadeira merda. É a música grotesca, chula, brega , apreciada pela casta inculta e pobre do povo brasileiro. É o oposto da qualidade magistral da verdadeira música popular brasileira.Fique pobre, de bolso e de espírito, e , acima de tudo de cultura. Compre este DVD..."
4,Harlem Boy's Choir,"Very inspirational, as the Harlem Choir always is. Professional production.Would recommend if you enjoy music from the heart & soul."
5,iGo power tips help avoid the clutter,With iGo power tips one can cut down on all this power adapters for all those accessories we have. Simple put iGo is GREAT! iGo Power Tip A73 for Plantronics Bluetooth Headsets
1,Incomplete description,I ordered this item for my Voyager Pro bluetooth headset. Unlike the description on Amazon this item is NOT for all Plantronics headset. It will NOT fit the Voyager Pro headset.
5,"Funny, sly, and enlightening","As usual, Lamott is funny, sly, and full of enlightening perspectives punctuated by bouts of self-deprecation. I don't think I would enjoy knowing her in person, as she seems to be one of those people for whom the normal difficulties of daily life constitute major hardships. Yet the way she tackles those hardships can be instructive for all of us. A few of the essays seem almost unfinished, or perhaps that's her way of giving us space to reflect further on the topic at hand."
4,Reminded me of L'Engle in nonfiction mode,"Author Anne LaMott has walked a different faith road than the conventional writer of ""inspirational"" books. Like Madeleine L'Engle, a favorite among novelists for me, she has no ties to the Christianity that identifies itself with conservative political and social beliefs. Her life story includes alcoholism, battles with a co-dependent mother, single motherhood entered into by choice, and a passion for causes. In this volume of essays, she draws the reader into that life. She writes with grace, beauty, immediacy, and dark humor, and she kept me turning pages longer than planned each time I picked this book up.My one negative comment is that despite agreeing with her about it, I became quite tired of hearing about the Bush administration. Otherwise, a good read by an author whose other work may well interest me!--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of ""Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle"""
3,"Grace, not exemplified","I began blogging recently with ""Grace: Eventually"" among three books lined up on my desk for summer reading. A Lamott fan since ""Bird by Bird"" I dived in to this book I gifted myself with two Christmases ago.As always, Lamott says things in a way that intrigues and challenges me. And yet, four essays in and now this far into a new presidential administration, I found her dings for George W, Donald Rumsfield, and Dick Cheney disconcerting. I don't mind so much that she and I disagree politically, but can't fathom that a book which claims to center on the notion of ""Grace"" would have so little evidence of it in the content."
3,I finally get Anne Lamont...,"She's so honest and she writes some amazing truths, but I finally get what intriges me about her. She's an unapologetic lefty nutcase, and I think that while she spews her hatred of all things Bush and thinks of them as the factual anchors of her work, its really all of the other lovely insights in her life and her writing that make her ""gag me - I hate Bush, Cheney, Global warming crap"" worth wading through. Just as I thought Anne was finally evolving, she hit me with her first anti-Bush diatribe - then the pace of anti Bush rhetoric speeds, and just when I think I can read no more...I get it, she hasn't evolved between pages 1-90, she's just giving us one more of her glorious travelogues. I'm an unapolgetic conservative, red meat eating, Christian, and still, Annie touches me more than she repels me. Thanks Girl - I can't help but respect a true believer and a lady who walks the walk everyday."
1,Rant and rant and rant,"I loved Traveling Mercies as it was autobiographical, funny and inspiring. This book is a series of essays mostly putting down conservatives, Christian or otherwise. The author admitted raging on about the benefits of abortion to a group of Catholics not knowing who her audience was. That's flunking presentation skills 101. And Christianity 101. Remember: Thy Shall Not Kill? Why did she need all those abortions anyway? Unprotected sex, while on mind altering substances with men unsuitable to parent. Not a bit of self scrutiny for her actions here. Where's the interest in that?She repeats herself several times, especially in putting down the Bush administration and goes on and on. I did not buy this book for her political perspectives, but for her spiritual ones. Read Traveling Mercies instead."
5,Grace (Eventually): Thoughts on Faith,Anne Lamott reminds us of our humanity and that we don't need to be ashamed of our warts. God continues to love us even as we struggle to love ourselves.
1,Really lackluster and boring....,"I expected witty, interesting, insightful. I expected too much because I didn't receive any of the three. This book seemed like a rant against conservatives or even against people with faith. Perhaps I didn't get it. However, maybe I just didn't want to. SO glad I didn't pay for this book. Dull!"
2,A George Bush diatribe,"Ann is creative and an ingenious writer. ""Bird by Bird"" is rich. Love her similes! This book however is a thinly veiled diatribe to show her journey of moral superiority over George Bush... I got sick of the Bush bashing some of which is woefully mis-informed pulled thru the grid system of her extreme liberal bias... The title of ""Grace..."" in my 35,000 foot view of this book was a thin veil to show that she indeed has an inner struggle of adjustment to vicissitudes of life (don't we all) but in the end she may be maladjusted, but she's vastly morally superior to George Bush, Dick Cheney & Rumsfeld... I'd start to enjoy the book then she'd have to put Bush back under her foot again... it fankly got sickening... It should be called; ""The Zen art of self disclosure and how to feel superior while bashing Bush!"""
3,A Gracious and Grievous Read,"There were parts of this book that were profound and powerful, drawing me into thinking deeply about the goodness of God and the challenges of life. The sections about Lamott's relationship with her son were particularly poignant, as was the chapter on assisted suicide. Lamott's reflections on nature and her own growth as a person (getting sober, coming to terms with her family background) were also helpful and encouraging.The book was somewhat spoiled for me by rants about right-wingers and George W. Bush and abortion and various other things. Being shrill is not the badge of authentic humanity. Lamott needs to extend some grace to those with whom she disagrees without demonizing them. In fact, if such an approach could be extended to our entire culture we would be better by far."
2,Too many lefty rants and too few thoughts on faith,"I adore ""Travelling Mercies."" Having spent some time as a Christian, I expected some mature Christian thought from Lamott. Instead, I'm kind of horrified. Jesus was awful as a teenager? Praying to Mary? Yay for abortion? What Bible is Lamott reading?I admire Lamott's raw honesty and the way she turns a phrase, but the ""I hate George Bush"" rants got really old. I may not agree with our President's decisions and I may not admire him as a person, but a certain amount of respect is due to the office of the President of the United States. It's one of the most difficult jobs in the world.After reading Lamott's last three non-fiction books, I get the idea that Lamott doesn't have anything new to say. Although she occasionally has wonderful insights, I won't be buying Lamott's books again."
2,Anne's Downfall,"I loved Anne's books, Traveling Mercies and Plan B - she spoke of faith in the most refreshing of ways and injected her own socio-political leanings and life in a healthy and relevant way. But Grace (Eventually) is a disappointment because here she presses a no-holds agenda as she uses her 'pulpit' to beat her political and religious prejudices into people.Her angst demolished any sense of the Grace she apparently attempted to address. And unless she gets back into the groove she was in before, this will mark her downfall for speaking things spiritual, Christian or otherwise. She is a great, great author - but if she can't speak handle political differences within the same faith, then she is as guilty as those she condemns."
1,Cold leftovers,"I had enjoyed Lamott's previous non-fiction books so thoroughly that I was genuinely excited to read this one. However, I was sorely disappointed in the general lack of creativity, wit and spark that so animated her other work. The chapters seemed derivative of her previous books on spirituality, and might easily have been leftovers or rejected portions of those works.I am pleased by her well-deserved success, but can't help but feel that she just phoned this one in for the advance and lecture tour."
5,Grace (eventually): Thoughts on Faith,Lamott has has written another interesting book.Reenforces belief for the faith journey.
2,Not what I expected,I read a lot of Anne Lamott in college and anticipated a good read. I would not bother with another of her books.
1,"Book is about the author, not about God's Grace","I picked the book up at a used book sale because of the title, I thought it was a book about Grace. Instead, this book is about the author's thoughts on faith, which is what the title says, so my fault for thinking otherwise. The book is full of eastern mysticism, and the author is very liberal. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,A Mellower Lamott,"I loved Anne Lamott's early work, but in the past years, her animosity and anger, coupled with her unapologetic self-absorption, had scared me off. I picked up this book with the understanding that Lamott had mellowed a bit, and I was happy to find that to be the case. There are still plenty of rants about the minutiae of her everyday life (""I'm breathing in! I'm breathing out!"") but there are also some real gems here. If nothing else, she's brutally honest -- even about her own shortcomings."
2,"Grace redux, eventually","I am a long-time Anne Lamott fan, but lately her work has been revisiting (revising?) the same-old, same-old. In her third attempt to tap the well of her developing spirituality, the well has nearly run dry. Most of the experiences she uses to illustrate her ideas are ones that were on the cutting room floor of her last two ""faith"" books. I recommend ""Traveling Mercies,"" but not this one."
5,divine laugh,"on taking a cruise and not getting the books on amazon on time ,in a bookstore in Boston Logan airport i pick up a book out of force.The thing is i hate being forced to do anything this time I'am glad i never thought i could laugh out loud(i'am from Boston).Thank you Ann."
1,Waste of Time,"I fell for the title and the cover art while browsing the $5 book table at Walgreen's. After slogging through the first part of the book, I realized the only thing this gal worships is herself. The book went into the trash."
3,height adjustment not handy,Nice product. But from CMT I expected more. More ease of use. You have to build the tool youself on a piece of wood. This is why Kreg is the leader.
4,Good CD!!,"This CD is really good if you are in the mood for something romantic. They have a new CD called Una Noche Romantica that just came out in January and it is even better. I would rate that 5++ stars. You should, however, check out this CD first to prepare you for the harmoneous voice the singer has on the most recent album. The singer has a voice that will make a girls legs tremble. HURRY UP and check it out, you will not be disappointed!"
2,Heavy Duty?,"Take the ""heavy duty"" description with a grain of salt. The picture and specifications do not indicate the reality of only a 34 lb. load limit which does plainly appear on the label of the wire clothesline as received. This product may have a similar outside diameter to a competitor's clothesline, but it is mostly plastic with only a fine wire core."
5,six pack,"It was a cute movie. It does have some language in it,but other than that it is a nice story with good acting, as good as kenny rogers can act lol. diane lane and the other kids and other characters are good.I remembered watching it as a kid."
4,Fun and enjoyable,This is one of my favorite movies but I can't understand why this DVD is OOP. I wish the studio would re-release this film because so many people love this film. It is a shame that so many are missing out on this great film. I would buy this DVD in a rocky top heartbeat if it came back out.
4,Memories...,"This is a great movie that takes me back to growing up. Acting is not that great, come on its Kenny Rogers. However you do see Diane Lane at a young age. It's a Sunday movie special, rainy day movie. It definately has a place in my heart!"
1,Trite and rather unpleasant comedy,"Kenny Rogers is a terrific, truly inspiring singer. But an actor? I don't think so! This film's unpleasentness and utter predictability make it neither funny or touching. Plus the story is really ludicrous and cliched. No wonder Kenny hasn't gotten too many starring roles."
4,The kids still love it!,"My kids who are now 23, 20 & 17 still love this movie; they watch it whenever it makes a rare television appearance. It is a movie for the whole family, and a real feel good film! Listen to the song ""Rocky Top"", you'll be singing it for years to come. This is a great little film."
3,"You're kidding, right?","Great movie! My 38 yr old son watched it and watched it and...........you get the idea.......when he was a kid. In fact, he couldn't sit still long enough to watch ANY movie or TV show......until SIX PACK came along.Now HIS son wants to watch it and has been doing so on Youtube but it's broken up into 6-minute segments (ridiculous)..BUT......now that I've said all the good and proper things about this family movie, let me have the final word......Satan will need a parka before I spend a hundred bucks on a 30 yr old movie. Someone is OUTTA THEIR MIND! The only reason I can't rate this with 5 stars is the PRICE."
4,Oldie but goodie.,While the plot is pretty predictable it is a very likable movie. Some foul language. Kenny Rogers at his best.
5,sixpack,"Was excited to find this movie. Have been looking for it for a long time. Great family movie. My children enjoyed it when they were growing up, now their children are enjoying it."
4,Great 80's movie,It was great to see the movie I remembered. The acting and story line was good. Great to see Kenny Rogers. One thing I did not like though was the language of of of the children. Suggest not to watch this with young children.
4,Six Pack,a classic 80's film featuring Kenny Rogers and 2 very young actors Michael Anthony Hall and Diane Lane.
5,funny thought....,Don't you love it when people leave negative feedback when in fact they never read the darn thing!
1,Dumbed down not as funny as P J O'Rourke,"Author has good credentials but a silly irritating style. Finds it necessary to shove a smarmy apology for about a paragraph for throwing in some history (Anti-Federalists, Whigs, etc.) which is essential to understanding Republican roots and the daytime TV level apology ends up running almost longer than the very brief historical background. Part personal memoire, part daily journalism on a USA Today level, part sophmore poli-sci term paper...and none of these parts fit or work together. Buy Republican Party Reptile by PJ instead."
3,"Dese tunes be phat, yo!","I took music cultures of the world, and let me tell you, jerry john bob joe walker is the greatest stuff I've ever listened to. Tight riffs, strong pumps, brahma bull vocals- This CD has it all! It be the Phatbomb!"
5,Digger is a groovy book,"Digger is an awsome book, I loved it. I think that people who like thhe movie Newsies should read Digger."
5,why is a great product out of the market?,Years have gone by and I am still searching for this item. I gave mine to my grandson as he loved it so much. Why is the Giovanna by Deny cordless cheese grater out of the market?Personally I could check most of my Christmas list if I could find it.
4,Convenient After Surgery,"I used these when I was stuck in bed for months following surgery. Showering was very difficult, and these were great for freshening up."
3,What? What? What?,"Serving as a ""Best Of"" collection, this album attempts to put Capone-N-Noreaga's hits onto one disc. It's a good album, but there are a few songs I would've expected to see, that weren't on there. There are 8 of Noreaga's solo cuts on the disc, out of 19 tracks. The last song is more of an outro, so really you're left with only 10 CNN songs. I think some of Nore's stuff could've been replaced with ""Y'all Don't Wanna,"" ""Bang Bang,"" or ""Bleeding From The Mouth."" The bonus disc is a nice add-on with some harder to find songs, but again features more Noreaga than anything else."
3,Colors Vary or Maybe Not,"I ordered two and got two pink cups. I don't worry about colors coordinating with gender but I think Amazon is setting themselves up for customers to abuse their return policy by not providing better customer service here with the lack of choice in the color.Not much to add here about the experience with these cups that hasn't been said already. The design of the Born Free venting system for their bottles leaks 95% of the time for me, so I don't expect any less with these since they use the same venting system."
2,This leaks through the top. Not usable.,"I should've just returned this, but I tossed the packaging. I have the Born Free bottles and love them so was expecting the same quality. However this one leaks between the rubber mouth piece and hard plastic cap. Unfortunately there is no way to tighten it to stop the leaking. So it has turned into a teething device."
1,Baby did not like it.,"Aside from having too many parts to wash, the spout is hard for my baby to suck. He hates it. But when I gave him the thinkababy sippy, he drank all his milk."
1,You can't pick the color of your cups!,I like these cups but was very disappointed that I could not specify which color I wanted. My little boy now drinks out of a pink cup :-(
4,Solid cup,"I read other reviews about not being able to suck liquid out, leaking all over the place etc., and felt I had to chime in. This cup has always been easy for my daughter to drink out of. It baffles me to think of others having issues. Yes, it leaks when you tip it upside down, but I don't consider that to be a major problem."
3,BPA free baby cup,"Good cup. Valve does leak at times, but overall an ok sippy cup. LOVE that it is BPA free!"
5,Great transition away from bottle. Not spillproof!,"When I first got this, my daughter hated it. I almost gave it away. It leaks, not a spillproof sippy. Maybe with the cap, but who the heck can keep up with that thing. A child sure isnt. They walk around with a cup and set/lay it down anywhere. I tried this again as a transition away from the bottle. Some reviewers complained it was too much like the bottle. So I used this cup to get her off the bottle. Great! My daughter also likes the handles. Much easier to hold. I use it at night and we were off the bottle quickly."
3,bpa free but not well designed,"the pros are that these cups are bpa free and the spout is soft so it's great as a trainer cup. my daughter took to it pretty quickly. the cons are that there are a lot of pieces and the spout tears easily which turns it into a leaky cup. my daughter is teething and tore two spouts in one week by biting them. we used gerber nuk cups for several months before this and those spout never tore. we're still searching for a well-designed, leak proof, bpa free cup..."
1,Very Difficult To Use,This product is too complex and has too many pieces. It also smells bad and the plastic nipple has a strange smell/taste. My baby just rejects this trainer cup while using other easily. It doesn't flow consistently and requires alot of work to use. The handle isn't fix -- it rotates all over the place making it tough for the baby to use.
2,They will leak eventually,"The reviewers that say these cups don't leak must have left their review within a few days of recieving the cups. At first they are fine, but after a few weeks they will leak and leak a lot. I would have given this review 3 stars because they are nice cups, but after talking with someone in customer service they are lucky to get 2 stars. The woman from CS said they are suppose to leak and they make no statement about them being leak proof. Only that they are leak reistant, and that is when you put the cap on. I hate misleading advertisements."
5,she likes it!,my one year old girl loves it. It doesn't leak but if you tip it over it will drop out from the opening in the spout.My girl loves this thing and she doesn't feel like she is being drowned like with bottles. I'm looking forward to the day that she can drink on her own with it without spilling a drop.Right now I have to tip it for her.
4,Great product!,"We've gotten great use out of this trainer cup until my son hit about 20 months. Then he would squirt the milk out everywhere and use it as a teether, which caused it to leak. Up to that point it was great. Even the nutritionist we saw liked it because, she said it wouldn't mess up their teeth and it flowed easily."
2,Leaks A lot,"I purchased two of these cup at a store for my Twin boys. At first They could not drink out of them. It was to hard. They were about 9 months old. Once they turned a year old they could drink out of it just fine. About Two months of being able to use them they began to leak a lot. If it ever gets put down on its side it leaves a big puddle. We spent a lot of money on these cups... I purchasedNUK Gerber Graduates Learning System Animal 2 Pack Spout Learning Cup, Blue/Orange, 10-Ouncelower prices and no leaks. They Born Free cups are going to be thrown out."
3,Soooooooo many parts,"I received this trainer cup in my Born Free gift set. My son loves them and he took to it right away when I took him off the bottle at 11 months. He was off the bottle in 3 days so I bought 5 more. The packaging says they can be used with or without the valve but I find that they are VERY leaky without the valve. If you haven't used these, it isn't a flow control valve like some sippy cups -- its the same pressure valve in the neck of their bottles. Handwashing 6 - 7 parts for 4 cups a day gets very annoying (the reason I wanted him off the bottle to begin with) so I started using the top rack of the dishwasher. Now they're leaky with and without the valve and according to the packaging they're dishwasher safe. The leaks aren't even from the drinking hole -- its coming from the neck and around the spout as well. I did notice that the cup that came with the gift set doesn't leak too much. Great cup if you don't mind handwashing so many pieces!"
2,We love the born free stage 2 but hated these trainer cups,"While I love the fact that these come in cute colors, my baby just used these as chew toys or to bang things with. He was able to use other sippy cups, though he preferred regular cups- so it may be him, but I had better luck with others. I'll try these with our next but I don't have lots of hope."
4,Great for transitioning to a cup,"This cup was great for making the transition while weaning. I already had a couple of other brands of cups but I could not get my then 12 month old to do more than sip from them. He needed to be adding several ounces of whole milk a day ... we tried this cup and the spout was a winner for him. The spout is soft and has a great shape, easy to suck from. The rounded handles make it easy for holding. He used the Born Free cup constantly for nearly two months, while getting used to other cups as well. However, the complaints about leaking and the handles spinning do occur over time. By teething on the spout it now leaks. Just one time of forgetting to put the valve in before tightening the lid down over the handle will cause pressure breaks on the neck of the handle, thus producing spinning. However I have yet to find a perfect cup and the Born Free was wonderful for us while making the transition!"
4,Great sippy and it does not leak!,"I have never rated a product on amazon.com before, although I have purchased here many times. I did not purchase the Born Free Trainer Cup through amazon.com, however, my daughter (8 months) has two of these right now and they work great! They are BPA-free - actually a company who intends to provide BPA-free products and has taken a stance on it - and they don't leak.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they had one that was even smaller - it's still hard for her to hold it up high enough to drink out of on her own, but she is getting the hang of it so I will be purchasing some more!"
2,"Not really a great ""sippy""","I have used Born Free bottles for my son since he was born and loved them. I don't love this product. It has been very difficult for my son to get much liquid out of it. I find the nipple to be pretty wide. Plus, our pediatrician has noted that this kind of nipple is not really that great, it makes a baby have to transition AGAIN to a cup that doesn't require sucking. I am definitely purchasing something else."
1,not recommend this bottle,"You have to bite the tip to get the water out. For a baby who just graduates from bottles, they suck the tip the same way as they suck the nipples- They won't bite it. So it is impossible for a baby to get water from it. My daughter is 18 months when I got this for her, and she never get any water out of it. It is a major design flaw."
1,leaks,I was very disappointed to spend so much money for this cup and then have it leak all over. The spout has a hole in it (not a slit as other soft spouts) and as soon as it is tipped to the side it steadily drips out. And babies like to shake things--this makes a big mess! I would not recommend.
2,Poor Handles / Hard For Baby,"Having come from the Avent system on kid #1, we rolled on over to Born Free this time around. While the bottles themselves were fine, these sippy cups are terrible. First, the handles are very hard to grasp. They're too small and in a weird shape. Second, its impossible to drink out of. Me, the wife, the baby, the 2 year old... we all failed to get more than the smallest drop out of it. Not to mention, after several months, you do get tired of all the parts just for a sippy cup. We switched the baby to a Playtex one, and he grabbed on right away, and took a good sip out. As an aside, we switched bottles to simplify now that he's past the colic stage and he drinks 3x faster with no throwing up."
4,"Great trainer/sippie cup, but son will need to get used to it.","I love the born free brand, however, my son only chews on the spout as opposed to drinking from it compared to the nuby brand. I think with a little more time he'll get used to it."
1,Pointless sippy cup.,"In a hunt to replace our years-old Gerber cups (with the valve that pops out at the slightest bump), we thought we'd give this one a try. Don't make the same mistake we did. One piece of advice is to try this cup first before giving it to your child (my older kids think it's hysterical to see mom & dad drinking out of a sippy cup!). I almost gave myself a hernia trying to get water out of this thing. And then, to add insult to injury, when I put it down, it leaks out of the bottom of the cap area. This would seem to indicate a backwards seal is forming.If I wasn't busy shopping for a new cup while entertaining my little ones, I'd consider creating a video review to show just how ridiculous this thing is.Based on the positive reviews I see here, I can only conclude that either the company's quality control is non-existent or... all the positive reviews have been left by company employees!"
3,A bit complicated,"Ok so sippy cups are not rocket science, but this cup has a few too many parts to put together. It's a lot to separate, clean and keep from getting lost in the cabinet. It also leaks a bit more than the others. It's not a horrible leaker, but a bit more other brands I've tried."
1,Impossible to get fluid out,This spout was extremely hard for me to sip any liquid out of so I didn't even try it with my 6 month old baby. Only way to get anything out of it is to squeeze spout very hard & suck at the same time. Returning.
2,Colors vary more than advertised,"""Colors may vary: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange."" I received a bright pink cup. Pretty color, but the cup is for my son so it's going back. Can't speak for the product itself, I have heard great things about the cups. Apparently they are hard to find, even on Amazon! :("
2,Leaks from the bottom,"This cup was great in the beginning for training. But now after many months of use and dishwasher wear, all of my Born-Free cups are leaking from the bottom. I can't seem to find the hole but milk/water spills all over the table and everywhere. I am over it and spending $$$ on these cups. My cheap Nuby's are holding up better than the Born-free. I am disappointed as I really liked them in the beginning."
4,"Good transition sippy cup, but probably not for older babies","This was a great transition cup because of the big nipple-like spout, easy flow, and handles. This cup is not leak free, will dribble out a little, even when new.The most negative thing about this product is all the parts. It has seven (7) pieces (the cup, the collar, the nipple, the silicone insert, the plastic insert, the handles, and the cap). It's a bit much if you ask me. We started my son on this when he was 9 months, but at 13 months he can use other sippies now that aren't such a production to clean and put together. That being said, the Born Free cup did serve its purpose by training him off the bottle."
3,No color choice,"When we ordered this product, we saw that there were assorted colors and we were unable to chose one that we preferred. We hoped that we would receive a gender neutral color but received a pink cup with pink lids and we have two boys. Now we have to return the product. We will not be ordering this item again as we do not want to potentially get another pink cup. We rated this product with 3 stars. We do not know specifically how this product works. We wish we would have had a color choice option."
3,"Ok, but beware of ""colors may vary""","So far so good, I have just stared transitioning my son to sippy cups so we don't really have a favorite yet. I haven't had any issues with leaks and we used the Born Free bottles so I was prepared for the multiple parts. I did however recieve a pink cup. I know I was taking my chances with the ""colors may vary"" but I thought I had a decent chance of getting a gender neutral color...guess not. If it turs out he loves this cup guess I'll just have to buy some at the store so we don't end up with a ton of pink cups!"
2,Beginner's Italian (Teach Yourself),"Teach Yourself Beginner's ItalianThe book arrived very promptly but although advertised as being in good condition, it had been written in with biro. If pencil, I could have erased it. That was a disappointment."
1,A Big Disappointment,"THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRIENDLY INTRODUCTION TO ITALIAN, BUT I FOUND IT ANYTHING BUT THAT. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE SMALL PRONUNCIATION GUIDE; IT APPEARS ONLY IN THE FRONT OF THE BOOK. IN MY OPINION, IT IS MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO HAVE A PHONETIC PRONUNCIATION BESIDE EACH WORD/PHRASE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO KEEP RETURNING TO THE FRONT OF THE BOOK. I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND BARRON'S ITALIAN AT A GLANCE; IT HAS AN EASY-TO-FOLLOW PRONUNCIATION GUIDE AS WELL AS PHONETIC TRANSCRIPTIONS FOR ALL WORDS AND PHRASES USED IN THE BOOK. TO SUMMARIZE, IF YOU HAVE NO OR VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITALIAN PRONUNCIATIONS, THIS GUIDE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
5,Great Power anywhere you need it,This is a great option for your garage when you need power to jump you car or charge a phone.
3,Will start your lawn tractor NOT A BUS!,"I bought the more expensive (bigger) one. I recommend calling repair shops in your area and asking if they have one and which one they recommend. I wanted it to start my 14 wheel dump truck and 40 foot school bus (which I drive) but could NOT handle even a full crank of the engine on my dump truck. Stratton Mountain Ski resort uses one to start their buses, so someone out there makes a heavy duty one, but, (this isn't it). Cost was HIGH ability LOW, can not recommend this for hard starting vehicles."
4,Good buy,"Very satisfied with this product. Solid, well made, dependable. It does what it's supposed to do with ease. I bought it for my daughter to keep in her car so I don't have to worry about her getting stuck somewhere if her battery should die."
2,Didn't hold the initial charge,I received the unit and immediately followed the charging directions. I then disconnected it and in no more than two weeks needed to use it. I couldn't because the charge was right back to the initial setting. I leave it charging all the time now.
1,Bad luck with this unit - do not recommend,"This unit started out well, I used it for jump starting the atv and lawn mower. It did not last long however. The fan started running all the time. This would wear down the battery. Keeping it plugged in all the time meant running the fan all the time. Eventually I unplugged it and left it for junk. I suggest you stay away from this one and this company."
1,"Failed after 105days. Guess what 90day warranty ""too bad for you""","This company is terrible. I bought this and the battery took a dump less than 2weeks after the 90 days. So the ends up being about $10 per use. The ""customer service"" response was I get to pay to send it in at my expense but if it's the battery they will send it back and now im out the purchase and the shipping. I opened it up and tested the junk ahem...sorry the battery and it is totally dead. Dont waste your money."
5,Battery Jump starter.,"This is a terrific product. After having it for approximately 6 months, we have found that it is an invaluable tool. We hunt and fish and have taken it with us for the boat battery, the 4 wheeler batteries, the camper battery, and the lawn tractors batteries. We have also used the plug in for a tire pump for all of our equipment. I would say that we have used it at least twice a week since we got it. We have not had to recharge it very often and the ability to check the internal battery is an added benefit. It also worked well for a small heater that we used in the deer stand. I don't know what we would have done without it and it is so much easier then plugging in a charger and running electrical cords everywhere."
4,Buy it!,"Bought this several months ago to jump start my 2002 BMW 330ci when the dumb owner (me) forgets to turn the interior light off after he's read the mail in the car/garage. I've owned several battery jump starters, none would do more than brighten the lights in the car. Click - click - click is all I would get.Long story short - did a lot of research - don't need a battery charger with compressor, radio, toilet seat warmer, tazer, etc. This Schumacher jumps starts my completely dead battery without a hiccup. I couldn't be happier!My only gripe is the vents on top of the unit - under those vents, clearly seen, is a circuit board of some sort. Perhaps this isn't an issue but, when it's raining outside, that board is going to get a couple drops of water.Hope this review helps.Cheers!"
5,Reall nice product,Read all the review and finally bought this buddy because it is a real pro. It works perfect but should mention that we need to buy extension to charge but it is fine not a big problem for me.
2,jUMP PACK,"WASN'T TO IMPRESSED, PLUGGED IT IN TO CHARGE IT'S 1ST 36 HOURS, THEN GO TO USE IT AN IT DOESN'T WORK. HAD TO SEND IT IN FOR REPIAR OR REPLACEMENT WE'LL SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT."
3,jump starter,Bought this for my husband for christmas who was looking for just the right unit this seems to be the one he likes the size for portability he wishes the cords were a little longer he hasn't used it yet so I'll write when he does good bad or otherwise
5,Schumacher jump starter,"We use this jump starter pack at work and it works so good, I purchased one for myself. It doesn't come with an extension cord, but you use any length one to plug it into a wall receptacle and it will keep the jump pack good constantly (keeps a trickle charge going into it.) Otherwise, you can plug it in every so often, they suggest once a month for a couple of hours to charge it back up. I had a cheaper one and it didn't hold a charge and wouldn't jump start any cars consistently, but the same model we have at work has lasted well over a year with no issues."
5,jump box,"great jump box , these boxes are 100 more anywhere else , would recommend this to anyone in the automotive business"
5,THE REAL DEAL,"I work in the automotive industry both in sales as well as service. The PSJ 2212 DSR is truly a durable professional grade jump box. I have owned mine for well over 5 years and it still performs flawlessly. If you are a do it yourself or professional technician, this is the best jump box on the market to have in your tool set. Like anything, if it is well cared for, no reason you should not get 10 years out of it. By the way, don't sweat the issue with the extension cord for charging. When my microwave died, I cut the cord off the back, went to the hardware store and bought a repair end and attached it. That is how I charge the unit. Use your imagination here folks."
5,Great product,The is a solid built product with heavy cables that are long enought to reach the battery while it stays on the ground.
4,Good Portable Power,"These units exceeded my expectations. They are dead easy to charge as you just plug an extension cord into the side of the unit (why didn't anyone else think of that). A clear digital indicator tells you the status of the charge. It even has a small cooling fan that runs during charging. We use these units for operating 12 VDC instruments in the field so we want a unit that will, at least, last all day. The jury is still out on this since few have been used yet but expectations are high."
5,Great Quality Jump Starter,"I did my homework before buying, I went to all my friends, all the stores and Parts houses, Walmart, Lowes, Home depot, Nobody had a Jump starter built to this standard, some had cables that looked like a cell phone charger, real thin diameter wire like comes on most Trickle chargers. This is Top Quality, works perfect. Hope it gives a long service life.I LOVE AMAZON.COM"
4,Does the job,"We have 2 of these Jump Starters already at work, so I was comfortable ordering this one. It works great! Ordering and shipping was efficient and quick!"
4,A cross- sampling of views,"I think the intro by Akbar Ahmed articulates best that there will always be a debate as to why certain authors works were included in this book. I personally like the sections from Huston Smith, Akbar Ahmed, Thomas Cleary and Michael Wolfe.The sections I find the most problematic were Women in Islam by Geraldine Brooks and to some degree ""Why they hate us"" by Fareed Zakaria. Ms. Brooks's essay deals with a family conflict which ends up in murder. For someone who want's know about Islam this is hardly the place to start. Similarly Mr. Zakaria is obective and presents some good information of ""why they hate us"", but there is a big problem in how eg he refers to the Quran. I will not even repeat what he says, but this is nothing but poisonous.If someone does not know too much about Islam I would say tread with caution. If you want to get a sampling and decide which books to read further then obviously this is a one way to do it."
3,Alien Science,"This is basically a Power Point lecture, which will be more palatable to some than others, but it's interesting stuff about scientific theory around the human brain and aliens, including the opening question, Have you ever wondered why we only use 10% of our massively super-charged brain? Lloyd Pye is the author of Everything You Know Is Wrong."
1,Not really a film...,"I've learned the hard way (by purchasing two of their films) at once that ""Reality Films"" is not really a film company. As with this production you are treated to garish music, cheesy special effects and what is basically a slide show done to music and voice-over. Anyone with a laptop can make what they call movies. Pass this by."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was hoping this would be more of a movie with narration, but in actuality it was a super long mundane college like lecture. I guess he had some interesting points, but he talked about subjects irrelevant to his point most of the time. Overall, I did not like this movie and could not even get more than halfway through it"
3,Bare bones information,"This is basically a no-frills lecture introducing some very radical ideas...namely that our own DNA is not entirely of earthly origin. The bare-bones approach was something I liked, because I like a good lecture, but not everyone is so lecture-oriented and they may appreciate a more flashy DVD. The information contained here was entirely interesting and worth the sacrifice of Hollywood glamour."
3,Lloyd Pye's theory explained,"Okay, forget everything you know, or think you know, about evolution and human origins--we are, instead, alien visitors from outer space. At some point in Earth's history, humans arrived--they weren't formed over millions of years from an ape-like ancestor. The actual science for this is explained in this DVD, and unless you're a forensics expert, a bit mind-numbing. Since there's a whole branch of science to understand evolution, it's not surprising there's a lot to say about an opposing theory. At over two hours of lecture, there's much to think about here, but unfortunately, even though expert Lloyd Pye is actually holding a microphone, the camera mic is apparently (you guessed it) on the camera, which makes it hard to hear."
5,Excellent,"Sound quality was good, content superb, Lloyd Pye is awesome anyway, but this was really enjoyable. I'd recommend to any looking for information in this field."
3,Great fun,"If the Three Stooges teamed up with Benny Hill and Red Skelton to make a horror movie, this might be it. The performers at this freak show have a great time, the audience in the bleachers not so much. But it's after the audience has left that the real fun begins. That's when the freaks conjure up the power of the darkness. This involves buckets of blood and an abundance of body piercing (made me look away). The story, as far as I could tell, involves a battle between two underground forces, one of which unleashes the dead, who rise up as zombies. As a movie, this thing is a mess, as great fun, it's great fun."
4,Unleash the freak circus,"If you're one of those people that is scared of clowns, this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you love Rob Zombie movies and stuff like that, then this will be right up your alley. Lots of blood, gore, and sideshow mayhem. What more could I ask for? heh heh"
1,NOT A GOOD BOOK -- STICK WITH COVEY,"Unfortunately, this book fails its reader on many, many issues. It reads a little too much like a kids work, with a small summary at the end of each chapter titled ""Moving On"" where the book provides the reader with an unenlightening preview of the next chapter of the book. On the whole. it's redundant, superficial at best, and supremely vague. Your best bet as a consumer is to find better books on the same subject, or simply peruse a copy of this book for its bibliography. All in all, not worth it. Stephen Covey's works are far superior."
3,An Accurate and Interesting Account of Life in Fitzgerald,"I grew up in Fitzgerald about 10 years later than the author, but it was uncanny how similar his boyhood experiences were to mine. We frequented many of the same places and did many of the same things. His account of farm life in the 30's, 40's and 50's was also accurate insofar as I experienced it as a town boy. He even had an anecdote about my father ""Doc"" Reeves, which was flawless as it described him and his ability to ""smell"" bream beds. Mr. Hopkins was not only a master's graduate and a farmer, but he became skilled as a naturalist, and even discovered a new species of fish, which was named after him. All in all, I found this book interesting, and believe any male who grew up in Fitzgerald would also."
4,"People & World of Fitzgerald, GA","I'm prejudiced, since (1) I grew up in Fitzgerald, the focus of the book, and (2) Hopkins tells well of my teenaged brother's death. But I think this book is a very fine account of a very interesting and unusual life, with rich human, commercial, and natural connections, in the ""one place"" of Fitzgerald, in central south Georgia. Hopkins is a life-long naturalist who has published much in ornithology; this book shows his broader life-long study of people and farming (and nature) in the land he knows so well."
4,One of 2008's best,"J-Live really kills this album, no doubt. His flow has changed a bit from ""All Of The Above,"" but it fits perfectly within the selection of beats he chose (or, as you might read in the liner notes, that chose him). The production is flawless, and though it lacks any skits and interludes, both of which I thought J-Live has done well in the past, it still has great cohesion. You will always want to listen to this album all the way through."
3,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I've had one episode in my extensive video collection for years, and when I saw the whole series (two years, 26 episodes) for $16, I couldn't resist.Packaging is super with a holographic cover that, when turns, Peter Brady's bandages disappear to reveal -- nothing.Video quality is generally excellent, and the sound is very good too -- with subtitles.The stories range in quality -- some were quite good, others I was just waiting to get through.Overall, for a good price, not bad entertainment though there are no extras."
1,OMG Bad,"This movie was a ridiculous waste of time. The cover art is encouraging - someone actually spent money to make would-be viewers believe the movie contained something meaningful. An effective ruse, given I fell for it and wasted 1.5 hours of my life in this meandering mess. Its a microbudget production, not even qualifying for low budget status. That in of itself is not a bad thing, and frankly, most of my favorite movies are low budget. But low budget does not have to mean bad acting, bad talent, poorly framed shots, etc. Worst, it does not necessarily imply a lack of a story. Movies are about visually telling a compelling story. Without a good story, the cinematographic exercise is a waste. And this one was a particular gem of a waste. The story was nonexistent, period. There's not much more I can say. Further, the acting and cinematography certainly did not even come close to distracting me from this glaring absence. What a waste."
4,Great material for beginners,"This book has all you need to know on a general basis about manufacturing, JIT, etc. It is of great value for people getting involved on ERP solutions."
4,impressed,"I am very new to excersize and bought this due to the great reviews. I have to say, they definitely are not planted reviews like you sometimes see!! Although sometimes she went a little too fast for me to get the hang of the steps before moving to the next one, I still think it was a good workout and fun!! Recommending this one to friends for sure!"
4,Awesome instructor!,"I have the extended dvd with the abs and arms portion and I just recently got this one. I adore Tracey, she's fun, knowledgeable and she kicks my butt everytime! This DVD is easier to fit in the AM before work or errands, but is no less effective!"
3,booty,Tracey Mallett this DVD was just okay to me I found that she moves quickly and the queues not easy for me to follow and a bit fast I guess I am not at that level I will give it away to a friend that is more advanced.
3,great compilation,"this is a pretty good compilation, as it branches out from the usual morcheeba or massive attack chillout and goes to bands like radiohead and cold play. but ultra chilled is alot better i think. it has 2 discs of great songs and costs alot less. the songs on this one are pretty good too; teardrop by massive attack sounds great, but the remix is even better. . but some other songs get a bit boring. i am glad that they used ""destiny"" by Zero 7, which is a great song... it introduces some unknown artists while having well known artits on it... but this is a pretty good album. but i would recommend ultra chilled 2002 over this"
4,Sexy !!!,"This is the sultriest compilation I had ever owned,this is not to chill,exactly,this is to spend a special night with your loved one,I like the fact that most of the songs have a beggining and an ending and aren't seamed one to another,that makes it easier if you like to make your own compilations,also I like the alternative versions of many very common ""chill"" songs like ""Teardrop"".The only reason I gave it only four stars is because I'm kinda tired of compilations that have ""Here with me"",""Destiny"" and ""Swollen"",don't get me wrong,I thing they are beautiful songs,but with all the music out there,one would think that they would stop including these songs in every compilation!!!.All in all,a very enjoyable CD."
2,Smelly!,It does what it says on the tin but also comes impregnated with a strong chemical odour that still hasn't entirely faded weeks later. Use it somewhere ventilated if at all possible.
5,A-is for Antartica.,"This delightful book is filled with pictures of penguins. Not only that, but it uses the pictures to help teach children the alphabet with Penguin names and words associated with the life of a Penguin. For instance, E is for Emperor and F is for Family. The last two pages of the book contain descriptions of what each word means and how it relates to a penguin's life. The pictures are vivid and full of wonder. I picked this book up because I love penguins and would recommend it to any penguin lover. However, I also highly recommend it as a good alphabet book for younger children."
3,same for a lot less at stores,Overall good quality that holds a lot of water. I am using it for a 7 foot tree and it is doing well. Only issue is the price. I found others in Walmart and even Walgreens for a lot less. I am rating it a three based on price.
5,Fantastic stand!,"This is the best tree stand I have ever used, and I've always had a fresh tree. We got a 7-8 foot tree and barely had to adjust it at all after placing it in the stand. We had an awful stand last year and had problems with it the whole time our tree was up - by Christmas we had about 10 books under one side of the stand to hold the tree up. This stand was FAR better! Like I said, we put the tree in, tightened the bolts, adjusted the tree one time, cut the netting off of the tree and it was perfectly straight. It also holds a lot of water, which is awesome. I was looking for a stand with a single spike in the middle and couldn't find one, went with this instead and I'm SO glad we did - this is way better. Definitely recommend!"
2,"too expensive, check return policy","I bought this tree stand assuming I was getting a deal, but that is NOT the case. I got a tree stand with my tree, that is EXACTLY the same, from the people selling the trees, for $15 LESS. I tried to cancel within 48 hours of ordering, but it had shipped already, so I figured I could ask them to cancel the order (since it's shipped via UPS, and sometimes UPS does that) and they would just get it back. Not so, so my overpriced stand arrived 2 days earlier than intended, in a GIANT box, and I have no choice but to keep it, because it would cost more to return it (even via regular USPS) than is worth it. I'm going to see if anyone I know needs one next December, because it's a good product, but overpriced from this seller.I'm giving the ITEM 2 stars, but the seller 0, because of the stand being more than I found it for in stores and at tree vendors, and for having a crappy return policy."
5,Perfect!,I purchased the tree stand for Christmas 12 and put up a seven foot tree with zero help...Great product easy to use!!
3,Jazz Meets Cuba,Good album from the fellows who gave us Classic Meets Cuba. I expected more diversity however this was stila well rounded and enjoyable listen. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys cuban music with a twist. well worth it!
3,"Hard to watch, hard to look away","This is a hard look inside the mind of a mentally ill person--rough to take and not much ""fun,"" but well-made and well-acted on a limited budget. For a one-room, three actor ensemble piece, it's got plenty of action, although a lot of it's like chalk on a blackboard. The screws tighten and so do the nerves. It's never quite clear what's real and what isn't, and for the most part you want to just flee, but you can't, and you can't look away...like a bad accident in slow motion. You have been warned."
4,A Good Book But...,"The directions for machine quilting are excellent. But my quilts are not 18 inches in size. It is very easy to move a tiny quilt around under the sewing machine foot. I want directions on how to quilt a bed size quilt. And so in this respect, the book lacks."
2,A bit too English,"I found this book to be a bit too English for my taste. I had difficulty with some of the idioms used and became totally lost in the British political references. I have read another book by the same author and had the same problem. I thought I'd give her a second chance. Her writing is excellent, and anyone with a deeper knowledge the workings of British politics, universities, etc. would undoubtedly enjoy them."
5,It Just works!!!!,"It's a very simple piece of tool. It helps to install wheel studs the proper way. it's very well built. Good product, I recommend it."
3,Be careful if you order this,The unit is well made and all but it is quite a bit larger than I expected so that I couldn't use it on my hub as the raised center didn't leave enough room to use it. So check your hubs before ordering and make sure you don't have a raised center!
3,Fairly decent DVD but slightly dated,"I picked up a copy of this DVD at the Postal Museum in DC and for the most part, it's informative and enjoyable. It seems to be slightly dated but the bonus material is nice. I would give it 4 stars but the cheesy soundtrack seems to have been composed on a $50 Casio keyboard by a high school student and soon becomes very annoying."
3,Did not put us to sleep,"I watched this with 2 teenagers because we are going to Washington,DC soon. It was informative and did not put us to sleep."
3,"""Ragwitch"" by Garth Nix","I absolutely loved the triology of ""Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen"", so I bought this book with great expectations. And to be honest, my impression after the first few pages was ""oh dear....."". The reader is immediately plunged into the story, without any opportunity to undertand the central characters. This is a real shame, as this would have made the story of their growth as human beings even more enchanting. However, I continued, and although not up to the standard of his later works, Nix's lively imagination is portrayed richly in an interesting and unusual storyline. To anyone interested in purchasing this book, I would highly recommend that they do. Not simply because it is a good read, but it is invaluable in showing Nix's growth as an author."
3,Not classic Nix,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good first novel, but its really not up to the standard of his later work. This is a fairly standard work of fantasy, children-get-entangled-by-evil-and-have-to-escape which, while it hints at the great imagination Nix shows in later work, doesn't really follow through. If you're looking for more of what you found in the Sabriel series, don't, because he's a better writer than that, but I'd recommend Shade's children if you're looking for a stand-alone instead of this."
3,"fun, and quick","I liked this one - not quite as good as Sabriel. Garth Nix makes me remember being a 12 year old and staying up late to finish Ray Bradbury, Ursula Le Guin, Patricia MacKillip. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what I just did."
4,Questionable,"When I first picked up the book, I wasn't sure how enthusiastic or how long it would take me to read. It seemed odd, and even after I had finished it, it still struck me as strange. It's not Nix's best work, but I can't say that it was bad. I ended up recomending it to some of my friends to see what they thought of it and they agreed that it was just not that grippping. We all enjoyed it, but thought it lacked something."
3,worth the time,"I am a great fan of Garth Nix, loving the detailed characters and an unplottable plot. Unfourtunatly, i found this book slightly boring.It lacks...umph(i cant think of another way to say it).While not as satisfying as any of the other books, it is still worth the time."
4,It was ok,"The book Ragwitch was okay, it was pretty typical. Because of the vivid descriptions of the evil creatures in the book, I gave it a 4, otherwise, it deserved a 3. Buy this book if you are just looking for a book to read. However, Garth Nix is not a bad writer. Other books by him are Shades's Children, The Seventh Tower,etc. Those are all great books. So just take a look at those books also."
3,Tropisms?,"What on Earth are tropisms? Is there a cure? But don't ask me; read the cover blurb, which provides one definition: they're ""moments and movements in time, delicate and precise intimations of what may be going on inside an individual or a family group, but all of them freed from the confines of plot, characterization, and time."" At any rate, this brief (71 pages) volume is made up of a series of twenty-four delicately wrought prose sketches, or short-short stories, if you will. As an experiment in prose, it's fairly interesting--thanks largely to Sarraute's appealingly limpid style--but really nothing to get excited about."
2,Can you say Commodore 64?,"Trust me, your friends will NOT be knocking down your door to get at these games. Spend the extra money and get something both more challenging and more worthy of the space it is taking up on your hard drive."
5,puro fuego !!!,"este es el disco mas sabroso y bailable en la carrera de jessica. los temas ""me gusta"", ""te devoro"" y ""lo tengo dominao"" te pondran a bailar sin parar. luego de este disco jessica grabo su mejor disco titulado ""jessica cristina"". este disco tambien esta muy bien recomendado, esta buenisimo!"
4,"An ""ok"" language","Visual Basic 6 is a very easy to learn language. If you have ANY knowledge of programming at all, then you will be able to pick it up in under a week. If you are a beginner, then this is the language for you. I was writing trainers for games with this language in under 10 days, and i'm only 14."
1,bait and switch,"I ordered Microsoft Visual Basic Professional 6.0 with Plus Pack,as advertized. I received VB 4.0, so be very careful when dealing on here. I am finished with this venue to purchase items that are integral to my work. Every piece of advertisement stated VB6.0...... but the seller (msblissbooklist)was dishonest. USE CARE when dealing with this seller. She has refused to answer 5 e-mails."
2,No Mac or Linux Support,"This Product works perfectly but doesnt produce executable files for Mac or Linux. If you ever need cross platform executables, save your money and time and start with Real Basic. Real Basic has a convertor for VB6 to Real Basic but it doesnt work well. I had to rewrite my program, but Real Basic can produce executables for Windows, Mac and Linux simultaneously. If you know Visual Basic, it isnt difficult to write for Real Basic. Real Basic has a very helpful user group forum which answers your questions within minutes to hours. Real Basic lets you use their product for a month without paying anything for the privilege."
5,DLL's A Snap In Visual Basic,"DLL's written in Visual Basic instead of C++ actually run faster, much faster, especially mathematically-oriented stuff! This has been backed up by tests! VB is incredible, incredible, incredible!"
4,Good for beginners,This book is excellent for beginning Spanish speakers. I was looking for something more advanced.
2,Not so relevant,"Has a lot of phrases to direct and ask questions, but it doesn't provide the ""how"" to respond to answers to directions made and questions asked. The book tells you how to ask a question without giving you the ability to understand the answer. Translates and instructs on phrases you would never use in an optical setting... ex: ""I stay up until 11"" or ""If you break it you buy it""... basically, the book is useless... wouldn't recommend... over priced for the quality and content."
3,Dissapointed,"Although the content of this text is acceptable (some chapters could have more detail), and the illustrations are superb, other areas are a bit dissapointing. The construction of this text is very poor, the ink that is used smudges at the lightest touch, the pages are not cut squarely, and the hardcover is poorly glued. The accompanying CD was a huge dissapointment. The quiz section did not work, and entire answer options were missing during the exam phase. Additionally, the drag and drop diagrams are very vague, with arrows pointing to inaccurate regions of the body. For the money, purchasing separate Anatomy and Physiology texts would be a better choice."
2,Random and Strange,"Ok, I'm missing the 'Genius' here. Being a huge KJ fan I find this double CD terribly egotistical and equally unlistenable. I agree 100% with the 1 star review below.Basically what you get is a bunch of random improvisation (the 3 instrumentalists playing 3 different songs at once). There are a few sweets spots when Jarrett decides to stop playing random disonnace but for the most part this is Jazz grandstanding at it's worst. Lack of melody, rythym or coherency. Just ego. Even worse, Jarrett's signature vocal atonal grunts, moans and squeaks are here in full force to detract from what quality Jazz there is. I'll stick with his standards."
5,Just Right .....,Product was as described and we received it quickly - a good thing when you want to cut grass. Will use them again
2,CD Copy Protection Ruins This Set,"I think the music from De-Phazz is simply amazing BUT why they let their record company put massive CD COPY PROTECTION on the enire set is absolute insanity. Has anyone heard of fair use here? I just want to listen to these songs on my iPOD for darn sake - these discs won't even PLAY on a regular PC. I'm returning these discs to Amazon for an immediate refund - shame on the record industry for coming up with goofy schemes like this that cheat a guy like me from my money. I paid $40 or so for the music guys - can't I use the music on my iPOD or simply listen on my computer? What did I ever do to you people to deserve this? Shame on De-Phazz for letting their greedy record company convince them that copy protection was a ""smart"" idea. It wasn't, and it makes me hesitant to buy anything from this group again. Disgusting greed."
5,We all know Mandy.,"As children, in a school setting, we all knew a Mandy. There seemed to be a shy kid in each class until someone befriended him or her.This story cleverly showed a means to bring Mandy out of her shell, so she could open up to trust her classmates.The author's work flows smoothly and is heartfelt. The illustrations are well done, as well as the cover design.Great job Barbara & Twynz Pub!"
3,Not much technical details,"As a professional engineer I find the book disappointing because there are too little technical details to justify why sidewinder is unique and why its development worth a book. Not that I am looking for classified information. The author has in fact reproduced some drawings from the engineers hand note and patent submission, but seems unable to explain how it works. The emphasis is on 'group dynamics', and 'management for creativity', etc. On that aspect the author clearly pointed out how a creative China Lake Lab was built. If the author is less vague about how the other lab/industry failed, or why China Lake lost its battle to bureaucrats, the picture will be more complete."
5,Early book a Winner,"I discovered Thomas H. Cook,s writtings several years ago and agree with some that He just might be one of the best writers in America. His choice of the perfect word and turn of phrase suddenly makes you aware that you reading a book by someone with a gifted mind. I purchased this book at a book fair, not seeing this previously in his list of books he,s written.This book is about a doctor who was at the death camps in Poland and escaped to South American with an aide by means of stolan diamonds.Like a fictional Dr. Mengele we learn of an apparent kind and generous person in a new life setting, tormented by his unspeakable and horrendous past. Cook takes this macabe setting and makes us all face the evil that is possible in man. It is a very worthwhile read."
5,A book that changed my life,"Among sci-fi/fantasy books, I think I can honestly say that this is the most amazing book i have ever read. In this story Marion Zimmer Bradley combines adventure, romance, political intregue, friendship, and loyalty, all under the theme of self acceptence. This is not the type of science fiction that holds itself together entirely by lightning fast action and improbable technology, the characters have depth and realistic reactions and emotions towards any circumstance. This is the story of Lew Alton and his fight to remain true to both sides of his heritage and his doomed love for Marjorie Scott, but it is also the story of Regis Hastur and his struggle to accept himself, and his friendship and love for Danilo Syrtis.This book is an amazing read, and though it has moments that made me laugh out loud, it is, principally, a tragedy. I cried twice, but then, I do cry over a lot of things...Yes, I deffinitely recomend this book."
5,This is the one of the Greatest books I've ever read!!!!,"From: Marjorie Scott The Heritage of Hastur is on of my all time favorites! It's about betrayal to the Comyn, hate,war, power, and love. The Terran Empire is trying to take over Darkover and make it a Terran Colony. But the seven Domains and the Comyn don't want that. So they send Lew Alton to Aldaran to find out what the sneaky Aldarans are up to. He finds out more than he ever wanted to know. Danilo Syrtis gets captured by some people from Aldaran because of his telepathic abilities. Danilo was captured so he could run a very powerful matrix, rarely used since the Age of Chaos. Danilo is Regis Hastur's sworn paxman and when he hears of Danilo;s mysterious disapearence he goes to seek the truth. When he finds that Lew is involved he is greatly disturbed. Now the rest is for you to read and find out if they can survive the strain of the matrix and also of the evil Aldarans!"
2,Brass Nozzle,The plastic adjustable nozzle that came with the Solo sprayer works better provides for more consistent droplet size. Use the brass nozzle only if you are satisfied with large droplets.
3,"Yes for Saul Bass Enthusiasts, No as a Kid's Book","I bought this both for the graphic design appeal and the hope that my son would like it. It is graphically interesting and unique, the paper stock, which is matte, has a great retro appeal, but as a read-aloud story it is really lacking - the text is strange, clunky to read, and the story is simply bizarre. Really only worth it as a collector's item for graphic design / Saul Bass fans."
5,Love Bing books,All my kids love Bing books - my older 2 still sit and listen or read them to our youngest. They and cute and funny.
5,"Prompt Delivery, 100% Genuine. 100% AMAZING. 100% ADDICTING",Amazing! ***** 10/5! Loved it. Loved all of it :) Recommended to all who want to get addicted to this amazing candy.
3,"Great quality, poor quanity","These are one of the best coffee candy's you can get they have a rich coffee and light sweet taste but for $6 you get a small package maybe about 30 not even enough to fill a candy dish. If money is not a concern buy at least 3 packages since these are addicting, if not look for a better deal."
2,Good coffee candy!,"This is my favorite coffee candy.The quality is good and it is small and low calorie, a little bit expensive here though!"
2,Too Expensive!,"The taste of this coffee candy is OK, but it is TOO EXPENSIVE!After I have just purchased a bag of ""Kopiko Coffee Candy"" from Amazon recently with a price of $5.49/bag, I found it (exactly the same candy, 5.29 oz bag) from a local Chinese grocery store for only $1.49/bag (5.29.oz).By the way, I like the taste of another coffee candy better: ""Kasugai Sumiyaki Japanese Roasted Coffee Candy - 3.8 Oz"". It you would like to try it, please do not buy it from Amazon, but try your local Chinese or Japanese grocery stores. I have just noticed that a bag of ""Kasugai Sumiyaki Japanese Roasted Coffee Candy - 3.8 Oz"" will cost you $7.99/bag (3.8 oz) here (on Amazon), but only $1.89/bag (3.8 oz) in a local Chinese grocery store here.I am from Columbus, Ohio, and the two Chinese grocery stores that I have mentioned are:1. CAM Asia Supermarket, 817 Bethel Road, Columbus, OH 43214, 614-442-1888;2. Sunrise Asian American Supermarket, 1841 West Henderson Road, Columbus, OH 43220, 614-326-1999."
5,Yummy!,My favorite candy since I was a kid! I cant wait to order more...this is really good when crave for coffee but you cant make some.
4,My Big Animal Book review,"I purchased this book for my 2-year old. She loves looking through the pictures as I ask her to find each one. My 3-year old also likes going through it with his sister. He especially enjoys the little quiz at the bottom of each page -- one descriptive question per page. It is great for the both of them! The picture book includes baby animals, pets, farm animals, birds, and zoo animals."
5,Favorite,"If your kids love animals like mine this is the book for you! My daughter ""reads"" this book multiple times a day and loves going over all the animals! She knows just about all of them and is only 18 months old! Great way to expand your childs vocabulary and get them interested in animals!"
5,Babies Love These,We got this for a one year old and she is fascinated by it. She can easily turn the pages and enjoys all the big bright photos. Perfect book for kids starting to learn about animals and imitating animal sounds.
5,Excellent Santa gift!,"I bought all three books as a special for my grandson who will be two in May - My Big Animal Book, Dear Zoo, and First 100 Soft to Touch Words. Perfect!!"
5,Great Book,"I bought this for my son when he was four months old. He loved it then and continues to. The book is huge, with bold colors and beautiful photographs. Each animals picture has the name of the animal beneath it. This type of book can grow with your child. He started out simply enjoying the colors while I read to him. Now he points at the pictures (in no particular order) and turns the pages for me. Older children can point out animals as you read and eventually read them to you. It's a solid board book that withstands chewing, sucking, and attempts to pry the pages apart. I'm certain this book will be one of his favorites for quite a while."
2,Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with this book as it has too many pictures on any given page. Is a nice big book, but too cluttered for a toddler. My grand daughters both absolutely love books but open this one and throw it aside."
3,Goo,I like all the animals but I would have preferred they not be so condensed. Too many animals crammed on a page but we still get to practice our animal noises with it. Still a great learning tool.
5,A nice book,My child really likes animal books so when I read all the good reviews on this one I went with it. It has very nice pictures and we have enjoyed looking at it and learning animal sounds.
5,My Big Animal Book,"My other grandchildren have enjoyed this book, and now my newest grandson is loving it! The pictures are GREAT!"
5,Great book!,My son was 5 months old when I bought this book. He loves it! He is crawling now and frequently choses to look at this book. It's very colorful and he loves animals. I think it helps with vocabulary too because the pictures are photos and not drawings.
5,My son adores this book,"My son loves picture books. We got this book for him when he was about 1 and learning to recognize and point at objects in another picture book. Now almost two, he still loves this book. He liked to identify the different animals. I like the fact that these are pics of real animals vs. cartoon or animated animals."
5,great picture book for toddler,"I am a nanny and purchased this book for a little girl for her first birthday. She loves to look at books and this book immediately became her favorite. She is learning so much from it. I would advise every mom, dad, grand or whoever to make sure their beloved toddler has this book."
5,Photos Use Real Live Animals,This is winner at our house. I like that photos of the real animals are used. Cute verses encourage your child to point out a certain animal.
5,Nice big book with big pictures for baby,Big pictures seem to be especially helpful to engage babies. My baby seems to like this book so that's all that matters.
5,My Big Animal Book (Priddy Bicknell Big Ideas For Little People,"What a great book. Colorful, interesting and educational. Children love animals and really enjoy learning about them. And parents love teaching children about them."
3,Great book but it fell apart,"We got this book about 6 months ago. Our 2 year old son (then 18 months) loved it! And he still loves it. It is one of his favorite books. But after 6 months of normal toddler use, it has completely fallen apart. It is too bad because otherwise it is a great book."
4,Good book,This book has brightly colored pictures. It appears to be very durable. My grandson loved all the pictures. I like that it just wipes off.
3,Good but could be better,"Bought this board book for my 10-mth old daughter who loves to read (and also tear up pages along the way). The pictures in the book keeps her occupied for a good 15 mins and she loves kissing the animals in the book. A good starter book for toddlers but perhaps require more interesting features like popups, textures etc to keep younger babes interested. Would recommend this book as a book for your child's first library."
5,Great First Chanukkah Gift,"We gave this to my son last year for Chanukkah, he was 6 months old. Now he's 1 1/2 and still loves this book. It is his favorite. The photos are great and he loves that it's oversized."
5,"My grandson's ""go to"" book.","I have been reading this book with my grandson since he was six months old and he is just now two. Early on, I would point to the pictures and name the animal and make the sound they make. That progressed to naming an animal and having him point it out to me. At some point, he took over and prefers to ""read"" the book himself to whoever is around. He can say most of the animals and the sounds they make It is his ""go to"" book and always the first one he chooses."
4,great book,"My daughter loved this book when I gave it to her. She loves books! It's great and sturdy for my 1 year old not to destroy! I recommend getting any little one this book, great for learning animals as well!"
5,I Love Kloot,"I Am Kloot's self-titled sophomore album confirms that this british indie-pop trio is the next big thing. The album has no weak point and every singel song could be a number one hit. My personal favorites are: From You Favourite Sky & Not a Reasonable Man.The lyrics are brilliant and exellent performed by singer John Bramwell. The sound of the record are more mature than their debut, Natural History, and makes more sense in a way. Creating a masterpiece on its second try, I Am Kloot is earmarked as one of the most interesting bands of its time. Are you ready for it?"
2,very dissapointing,"I bought this album after hearing the single 'from your favourite sky'. After having listened to the full album, i was just very dissapointed. 'I am kloot' is just a very poor effort and it is nothing special. It just keeps dragging on and doesn't grab your attention as a good record should. Apart from the single 'from your favourite sky', all the other tracks should have been left of the record! The Dutch press should be ashamed for describing this as 'the best new thing from Britain'; it certainly isn't! Don't waste your hard-earned money on it!"
5,This is not your father's compilation album...,"For those of us who tend to associate the words ""compilation album"" with gas-station-giveaways and magazine-freebies, ""Big Fish, Little Fish"" is more than just a pleasant surprise - it's a stereotype-shatterer.This album is a collection of 16 choice tunes from the best female artists on the Chicago music scene today. I only get 1000 words to write this review, and that is just not enough for me to give each artist the attention that she deserves. The simple truth is that each song on this album is excellent, with flavors ranging from jazz to folk, pop to disco, big brass band to solo guitar. Truly, something to suit every taste.I'd write more, LOTS more, but it's all to the same tune: buy this album. You'll like it. I don't know how to say it more clearly than that."
2,Not for perfume,"Lovely bottle, but the dropper does not seal, so perfume would easily evaporate. Got a second one, same problem. Needs some kind of stopper or sintered fitting."
2,Not the best book of the series by far,Not all that great. Wow did this one drag on! Lot's of story about Jesse and Jenn and whomever they are sleeping with. Lot's about Jesse's therapy. Lot's about Jesse's drinking or not drinking. Not a whole lot about the story. The story itself twists and turns with some dead ends and it seems to take forever to get to the conclusion.I didn't think much of this one.
1,This book is horrible,"To put it simply this book is horrible. It isn't the plot or story. It is the writing. The book is only 285 pages long and cost $10. That is half as long and twice as much as most books I read, and they are a lot better. His writing style leaves something to be desired. With dialogue, it is only ""said"". Can't he use other words like ""respond"", ""reply"", ""asked""? Also, nothing gets any description except for alcoholic drinks and a ""white bowl with a blue stripe."" Who cares if the bowl has a blue stripe? I received this book as a gift and I feel bad that they wasted there money on something so worthless."
2,"In this case, sex doesn't sell.","One of the things I love about Robert B. Parker novels is the witty dialogue between the characters and a strong, unique story line. That element is missing from the new Jess Stone novel and is replaced with the 'f' word (Jess uses the word, Jenn uses the word, they all are engaged in the word and basically is the entire premise of the book) and continuous sexual references. The entire book was disappointing."
3,Disappointing,"SEA CHANGE is the fifth entry in the series featuring Jesse Stone, Chief of Police of Paradise, Massachusetts. Jesse's' most recent case is investigating the body of a decomposed woman washes ashore in Paradise. Florence Horvath was wealthy with too much time on her hands for booze, wine, and men. As Jesse delves into her past family secrets are uncovered.I usually enjoy the Jesse Stone novels. I like the character a bit more than Spenser. Jesse is still dripping with Parker's prerequisite machismo, but Jesse has a bit more emotional depth. This is my least favorite in the series because at the end the whole premise of the narrative left me feeling a bit dirty. There were no redeeming characters except the recurring cast. It written in the usual easy-reading Parker style, but there are so many better stories from his vast backlist."
4,A darker side of Jessie Stone,"Jessie Stone is an example of Robert B. Parker's skill with character development. Unlike Parker's most famous character, Spenser, Jesse is flawed and often struggles with finding his path in contrast to Spenser who is always sure -- just not always sure as to why.Jessie experiences a SEE Change in this novel, but must destroy some of his deepest delusions to do so. The novel is somewhat dark but enjoyable, nevertheless."
3,Stone Cold Killer,"This was my first Jesse Stone book and I was disappointed. There is no more content to this thing than you would get in an episode of the Rockford Files. All the characters are hopelessly two dimensional and despicable. Why do we need two 50 year old drunk yacht owning South Florida playboys chasing young girls? This book has all the formulaic characters we have seen in the last 90 years of deterctive stories -- tough guy alcoholic cop threw in the towel on the big city moved to Paradise, trying again with the ex-wife, rich drunk Floridians, sex-starved, drug using blonde bimbos relying on the kindness of strangers, other shady businessmen.I listened to the CD and that might make it worse. Parker is old-school, does not write for the ear, way too much dialogue surrounded with he said/she said. They should just make new episodes of the Rockford Files from these characters (the Hilton sisters could star) and not subject the public to these books."
4,To have a good time,"Albeit this is my first RP's book and so I can't compare it with others Jesse Stone's novels, I can tell you that this book'll let you read it. Is not an excellent thriller but is very fast to read. The investigation had a lot of luck to be solved. The shrink part is just to waste pages and ink. But you'll have a good time reading it."
5,Sea Change needs no changes,We are fans of the Jesse Stone Movies so reading the books that inspired them is interesting. I recommend it.
2,NOT UP TO ROBERT B. PARKER STANDARDS,Long time fans of Mr. Parker will be let down by this depressing sex romp. If you want to read this book save your money and check it out from the library. Mr. Parker didn't seem to put a lot of effort in character or plot development in this book.
1,Amazon won't let me go <1,"Speaking as someone who owns at least one copy of every one of Robert B. Parker's novels, I am seriously sick that I wasted $20 and an evening on this poorly written and edited junk.It was so bad that there were continuity issues where Jesse came back out of the dyke girl's cafe to get whatsername (the ex-wife) and then one sentence later apologized for not coming back out to get her.Throughout the book Jesse fell into both Spenser and Hawk's grammar, mind -set and word choice and then wandered back out.The entire book read as if ir was thrown together quickly to generate cash or make a deadline, a serious disappointment :("
1,Very Disappointing...,"I own all of Parker's books and wish I had not purchased this one. The subject matter was depressing and the ""Jesse Stone and ex-wife storyline"" is boring and repetitious.The book is about pornography, incest & sexual perversion. I read about sexual abuse in my morning newspaper and hear about it on the nightly news every day. I read to escape for a few hours from all the media hype and to derive some enjoyment. ""Sea Change"" was a gloomy and bizarre reminder. I have thoroughly enjoyed the majority of Mr. Parker's books but this one was a major disappointment."
1,a fraud,"do not buy this book.i'm a long time parker fan. i own most of what he has written and have read what i don't own.but this book is a fraud. parker has taken a 30 page short story and padded it into a 100 page novella by the use of the tiresome jenn-jesse relationship. fine, if that is why you read parker. but then through double spacing and ridiculous margins he bloats this thing up to 300 pages. get real.your library will have a copy if you must read it. it will take you about 90 minutes. (...).maybe parker can be encouraged to write again if this dreck doesn't sell."
1,"A big disappointment, his worse novel ever.",I am so sorry i spent over $20 to read this book. The plot is extremely thin and borders on perverse. I am not used to such an insensitive blase mystery about incest and sex parties. Most chapters are only 1 1/2 - 4 pages long. As another reviewer said he could have written this book in his sleep and i think he did.. not worth the time or money. lisa b
3,i like his Jesse Stone books much more than his Spencer novels,i like his Jesse Stone books much more than his Spencer novelsi like his Jesse Stone books much more than his Spencer novels
3,Light summer read,Parker writes well and this is an easy summer read although the topic is bad enough - interestingly the Jesse Stone in the books are very different from the character portrayed in the films featuring Mr. Tom Selleck - still an easy nice read when stuck in airport or awaiting at the dentist
2,Formulaic Parker,"Robert Parker by now can write his novels in his sleep and this one reads like he did just that. Stone and his ex wife are slight variations on Spenser and Susan. Parker subtly alludes to Spenser during the course of the novel to neatly tie his characters together. Unfortunately, all the characters in this novel are cardboard thin and mostly caricatures that Parker can ridicule. Average at best for this author."
2,Psychobabble....,"I have been reading Parker since I discovered Spenser some 20 years ago.As I today, I can officially say that I am dead tired of the constant psychobabble that turns up in the alternating chapters of nearly every one of his books. Did he start the Jesse Stone series just because he had realized he'd worn out the welcome of Susan Silverman and her dreary ""insights"" years ago and needed to give us a new shrink?Jesse and his crew are an interesting bunch, written in Parker's classic spare prose style, but the entire divorce/recovering alcoholic subplot bores me silly. I'd much rather have every one of those alternate chapters filled with more characters, more plot and, bottom line, more interesting story development.OK. You get the point."
5,Great for a 11 year old girl!,My daughter loves this and hasn't put it down since Christmas morning. We may sign up for lessons now. Perfect size for her hands. Fun colors. High quality. And I love the great padded bag that came with it. We also bought a Daisy Rock beginning guitar book. It's got easy instructions and exciting graphics to keep her interested.
4,DOES NOT Come with a gig bag but,"Tuned up well, nice action and just the right size for a 6 year old. It's very cool! I ordered the gig bag separately and they're not expensive so no biggie. I don't think it's too girly as one reviewer stated ... I'm thinking about getting one for myself and I'm not small or girly. It's a great size to take to work where we play at lunch sometimes. Very lightweight."
5,His best stuff.,"I believe this is his first collection and I think his best. All his own writings, fact or based on fact, or fiction. The funniest adventure writer I have ever read. If you only want one John Long collection, this is the one to get."
4,Mingus's top albums,"Charles Mingus ranked this album along with its mate Changes One, as some of his best work ever. I really liked Changes One. This album does not have the same grab on me as the previous one. It is very tight as you would expect from Mingus, and a great album. I think I just had my hopes a little too high. I own almost all of Mingus's works and I would definitely recommend this if your a fan, but it would not be the first album I would tell you to buy."
1,Cheap Chicks!,"My dog loves these, so when I found these ones I assumed they were the same quality. Not! I bought two and 1 barely squeaked. The first I played with my dog for maybe 2 minutes and it ripped right in half! What a waste of money!"
1,Poor quality! Lasted 30 seconds and resulted in a very sad dog,"My dog had received a chicken like this as a gift. She loves it to death, and very near death it is. We decided to get a replacement as the old one (which has lasted about a year) has holes and pieces of stuffing coming out. This one looked very similar (same mold, same paint) to the one we received as a gift so we thought it was the same quality. I took it out of the box, gave it to my dog, and within 30 seconds the chicken was torn in half and all the stuffing was falling out. My dog is a Boston Terrier, so while energetic, it's not like this chicken was mauled by a massive beast. It was very sad when we had to hide the remains from her and put the destroyed chicken in the trash. Not just sad, but tragic in the world of a Boston Terrier. This chicken just isn't pet quality, despite being marketed as a dog toy."
2,Poor chicken,This dog toy lasted about 2 minutes. My Sheltie tore it in half! He didn't even have to try hard. Very disappointed. Oh..and it is not very big!
2,Body Glove EarGlove Pro,"I was looking forward to getting this ear bud because it was stream line and sleek. I ordered 2 of them and when I got them I opened one up and gave it a try. Needless to say I didn't like the way it made me sound to other people that I was talking to. Every one commented that I sounded like I was in a tube. The sound quality in the ear piece was fine but, because of the mic being designed into the ear piece with unidirectional pick up it makes you sound bad to every one you are talking to.Bottom line: I sent them back."
4,One of a kind.,"Rosemary Jackson's book approaches the difficult and somewhat unusual topic of mother's who are separated from their children from both a personal and philosophical perspective. The author takes the reader through a historical and cultural journey in an effort to understand why it is so difficult for women in this situation. She explains why women who leave their children invoke such extreme reactions, particularly from other mothers. The book is supplemented with vignettes, women who tell their individual stories, each quite different from the other. Even for those readers who find the much of background content somewhat esoteric, they will be moved by the stories of the women, and by the candour of the author in sharing her own story. Definitely a must have for any woman who has, by choice or design , been separated from their children. This book is also highly recommended for students with an interest in women's issues."
2,Only Good for those who have adopted internationally!,"The stories were sincere. I was looking for more transracial adoption stories on older child adoption but only found one inside this book. The black children that were adopted were adopted as infants, so it wasn't of much interest to my situation. I found that each parental story was very honest and will help those of you who have adopted internationally."
4,TIGHTLY MADE AND INTERESTING FILM,"This is a very well-made film marked by solid direction and acting. The script is linear, suspenseful and leisurely enough to permit character development. Although James McCaffrey seems rather wan as someone to be desired, performances by John Glover (excellent as usual) and Polly Draper more than make up for him. The scoring was effective and the blocking unobtrusive. Newport Beach was perfectly cast. The ending was more layered than is immediately obvious. Although this effort is underrated and largely forgotten, an opportunity to purchase it will be rewarding."
4,Not since Hitchcock..a real sleeper,"I dont no where you dug this up but it is a great movie. Obviosly the director, Mr Westervelt? studied hitchcock. For a one and only movie..unless somone knows of another by this director..it was awsome. Filmed in newport beach California"
2,Gaeahh!,"This show is documented proof that some celebrtities need to be ground up into cat food. Think about it, and then watch the show. VH1 is like the Walmart of television. Thanks VH1 for contributing to society."
5,As a former casino worker,"As a former casino worker I can attest to the veracity of this wonderful book. I also know what a difficult task it had to have been for the photographer to gain access inside the glitter. Casino workers are an increasing portion of the working class in the United States, but are nearly invisible. This book vividly portrays their work and lives, and makes clear that the job is not the totality of a working person's life and with other opportunities in a more just societies these same people might be scientists and professors, writers and film directors, senators and govenors."
3,Don't believe the hype,"Don't believe the hype about this book. The cover blurbs would have you believe that Kit Miller, a working-class hero, somehow penetrated the ruthless security of Nevada casinos to tell the stories of those down-trodden by the evil gambling empires. In reality, Kit Miller comes from a wealthy family, and she had little difficulty gaining access to the casinos. To her credit, Miller sets aside her liberal political heritage, and presents her subjects' stories in a highly readable manner, free of ideological slant. Her subjects are no more exploited than any other working persons, and their employers are no more evil than those outside the gaming industry. This is, however, a well-done book, and although Miller's main credit is as the photographer, she is a deft writer. It's just not the book you might expect from reading the ham-handed back-cover blurb."
3,Mysteries of Angels & Demons(2009),"This was not as informative as I thought it might be from the trailor; but, the service was great! Thanks!"
4,Nice Starter Deck,"I must say, this is the first deck i got. Still is the deck i used in tournament (even though i did some additions like adding a charizard and articuno to the deck.) This deck features fire and water (a deadly combo i must add) with charmander evolving into charmeleon, plus for water poliwag, going into poliwhile, and finally to the holographic and very powerful poliwrath! This is a great pokemon starter deck, and I recently bought one for my girlfriend little sister who is learning how to play the card game. This deck is less complicated than the other ones (since its pokemon lack the ability to confuse, poision, put asleep it's opponents) This deck is about full flight attack. You can't go wrong with this deck. To tell you the truth, i'd buy it just for the poliwrath. However, the deck is set up nicely and you can easily compete with even advanced decks!"
4,Very vivd color,"I like the color, but, my granddaughter liked it better. So I gave it to her. You can't go wrong with Opi, it has something for everyone."
4,"Good Masher, But...","...Needs to be improved. I was impressed by quality of this masher - length; handle is very comfy. But when it comes to the job, it's hard to push down. I found myself adding second hand for that. That's probably why handle is so long. Perforated holes are too small. My wife insisted to return it. But I fell in love with the design and decided to improve it:I took a peace of 2 x 4, cut a bit edges to fit into the masher, put masher up side down and drilled all existing halls as wide as possible. Then I polished both sides of mashing plate.Now masher does the job much better. If you want to do mashing faster, I'd recommend to start with wire masher and finish with this one for creamy texture."
4,"Spud-errific, but not Smashing","This is a solid piece of hardware and stood up to severe usage. (I'm known to break three of four ""regular"" mashers on a given Thanksgiving.) I recommend its use it concert with a wire-type pre-masher. The initial wire-masher will soften up the potatos so that this almost ricer-like face plate can render them the perfect consistency. I only gave it four stars, however, because it is just a little bit to small. The perfect design would've incorporated a mashing surface with about 125% of the area."
4,no smooth Jaz here. . .,I hesitated buying this one because when I listened to it on the 'listening station' headphones it sounded like the generic hell. I later bought it anyway. It wasn't until I played it in my car that I truly appreciated the '79 mix' of this thing. Geordie's guitar EQ sounds absolutely great through my Mazda's 9x6's. I'm actually enjoying this more than the s/t '03 release because it sounds more like their live show. I'm not usually a lo-fi fan but I've certainly grown to appreciate Hosannas.
2,All power and no substance,"First I must say that it is entirely admirable to see a band as far along in its career as Killing Joke playing with such intensity, aggression and sheer power. However, these alone do not make for a good listening experience. Somewhere along the way the trademark atonal and eerie riffs of guitarist Geordie were largely lost, to be replaced by the simplest of power chord progressions imaginable (sometimes only one note!) strung out for way too long. Gone too is any semblance of melody or hook from vocalist Jaz Coleman (yes, melody - it used to be there!), who is reduced to hoarse shouting (one too many cigars, Jeremy?). On this album there are occasional glimpses of the band's previous greatness, and two or three reasonably good songs, but the overall impression is one of lazy self-indulgence - the fruits of extended jams rather than song writing. Very disappointing..."
5,I Love This Book!!!!,"I am a new found Kevin Young fan, but I now know that I will be one for life. I discovered Jelly Roll at my college's library after I was initially seeking another one of Young's novels. I stumbled upon this and noticed the vibrant hardcover and couldn't resist looking through it and then checking it out. I read a good 90% of this book before buying my own copy. I have yet to finish it with school work piling up, but I am certain that I will finish it before Christmas and will be soon seeking another one of Young's books. There is something addictive about his style of poetry than makes you want to continue on for as long as you can until you have to pull yourself away in order to move on with the day. I also loved the theme that was present in this book, even with minimal words, you can still feel the passion behind them. I hope to meet Young one day until then I hope to get my hands on more of his work."
3,Better than that Basquiat Mess!,"... I liked JELLY ROLL, at least it's brief. Liked it way better than that Basquiat mess. Too long, too pretentious, though there were some gorgeous moments, too. But give me the art any day. After reading a few of the poems, you got the sense that the author was repeating himself just to hear himself. In JELLY ROLL, he seems to take his time, be more respectful with his art. And since when does a Harvard degree make you stepchild to the blues? Let a brother flex or something!"
3,Good but way too long,"I liked quite a few of the poems in this book. Unfortunately, it's way too long. The weak poems water down the strong ones. If the book's length had been shortened by 1/3 or 1/2, the whole would be stronger than the sum of its parts.What's with the fixation on an author's bio? Let it go."
1,Is this a parody?,"Painfully obvious blues imagery and tiresome similes wear the reader down quickly. The stereotypical ""Jook Joint"" language is practically offensive, coming from a Harvard educated writer. About as ""bluesy"" as an Eric Clapton imitator in a college sports bar. I had hoped for better."
3,Galvanized Nails are not all created equal,"When the box of nails arrived it was ripped open so badly that strips of nails could have easily fallen out. I removed the nails and repaired the box with duct tape and it appeared that they were all there. The nails, however, did not appear as shown in the sales ad. When I looked at the nails in the ad picture, they appeared to be the silver colored hot dipped galvanized type nails. The nails that were sent were golden colored with ring shanks. Upon researching I found that there are several types of galvanized nails, only one of which is compatible with treated lumber. If you are looking for nails to use in the new treated lumber, make sure they are ACQ compatible. My mistake for not paying close enough attention. Good luck."
5,This is a MUST READ!!!,"Tony Magee's book will ignite your energy to get up and make a change. Since, I've started reading his book I've overcome two of my major fears and I'm still working on a third. This book has helped me stop wasting my life away and to start focusing on what's truly important and that's finding my own purpose."
4,The perfect introduction to Italy's finest,"If you are looking for an introduction to the music of Italy's finest male pop singer of recent years then here it is. ""Eros"" collects the best of his songs up until 1997 (some of them re-recorded). Surprisingly the new version of ""Cose Della Vita"" now with added Tina Turner, is a success. My other favourites are ""Piu Bella Cosa"", ""Terra Promessa"" and ""Un Altra Te"" but most of the 16 songs are very good indeed, with a number of ballads for those of you who like that kind of thing. Also try his most recent CD ""Stile Libero"" for more of the same - upbeat pop which is professionally played and produced."
3,plain vanilla,"Don't understand the rave reviews everyone else has submitted. Eros has such great voice and style--all of which were missing in this CD, for me anyway. If you listen to him on ""Pavarotti and Friends for the Children of Libera,"" at selection #7, you'll hear something truly wonderful by him!"
5,Best Contemporary Italian CD,I have owned this CD for about 5 years now and I find myself still listening to it after all this time. It is one of the best CD's I ever purchased. There is no one like Eros....
5,Grande Eros. I'm proud of you.,From an italian to all music lovers in the world: buy this CD. Period. It's simply Eros's best work.
5,Bravissimo,"One of the greatest Italian musical accomplishments I have ever heard. The whole album is a delight to listen to, especially the songs ""Musica E` "", ""Piu Bella Cosa"", and ""Memorie"". I recommend it to every connaisseur and novice of Italian pop."
5,Eros review,This is a very good CD for listeners. I first became aware of Eros while enjoying a Bocelli CD and wondering who the other singer singing the duet was. One of my Italian friends clued me in and so I was hooked.Eros is a very fluid singer with good range and the ability to sing the throaty notes along with the melodic ones. He really knows how to sell a song and this album is a good teaser to get you to want to buy more.I would highly recommend this CD to all.
5,Bravissimo!,"The first time I experienced the listening sensation of this CD in its entirety, was at high speed in an Italian sports coupe on the Italian autostrada. Que l'esperienza! All of my Italian friends love his music. Eros, with his exhilarating music, will have you feeling like you're Italian as fast as an Italian sports coupe can get from 0km to 180km! Tina's accompaniment was extraordinare! Open yourself up to some Italian culture, and add this to your 'raccolta'."
5,My very recent discovery,"I am a New Zealand Maori woman who visited Russia in May 2005. In the middle of the Siberian Plains, Irkutsk, I heard Eros for the first time ever. I do not understand the Italian language, or Spanish or Russian for that matter but the rhythm, beat and feeling was awesome. By the end of October 2005 I should have all his cd's-I had to shop through amazon.com because there are none of his cd's in NZ. Actually, there are a couple but not many.He has been the best musical experience I've had in a long time and the duet he does with Tina Turner on her double cd is perfect-what an amazing combination.cheers."
5,Simply Eros,This CD is a must for those searching the perfect match between art and pop. A wise selection of the artist highligths that takes your mood from clear and deep thoughts to instant joy. The music leads you to evoke the beauty of Italy.
5,Eros,"A Must have. A great balance of rythem, and Italian Pop. I do not speak Italian yet this as do all of Eros Ramazzotti's music speaks loud and clear. His best to date and they are all good. Also how can you bet that duet with Tina Turner and above all else Andrea Bocelli."
4,Beautiful,"This set is beautiful and shipping without any scratches or chips to the pieces. The only problem we had was that we needed to make the holes where the screws went in larger. So if you are putting it together and the screws just don't seem to be going in, it's not you, you will need a drill."
2,Basics of Wireless Comms,"This is a good introductory text into the mobile/cellular space. Has a decent discussion about the various technologies. The title is a bit misleading, the book does not provide an indepth discussion of applications such as setting up SMS, ring-tones, wireless games etc. All the smae, its a good read for a beginer"
5,A little of everything,"Explains what lies behind most of the hype about 3G and mobile Internet, plus a lot more like MMDS that I hadn't heard of before. Don't expect it to turn you into an expert on wireless overnight, but it will bring you up to speed on the technology."
5,Interesting and Useful,"A helpful introduction to wireless and mobile systems, and the things you can do with them. It covers both the technology and the economics, and is generally well-written. It isn't really an engineering manual or a users' guide for your cell phone, but then it doesn't claim to be."
4,Nicely worded,"Though not as cute or attractive as some of the other grandmother memory books, I liked this one because of the wording used in relation to the grandfather. My parents are divorced, so I didn't want a book that celebrated their relationship, just one that reported about it. This one is good for that. It can also be modified slightly to report about a parent/step-parent couple without too much confusion."
3,Nice and to the point.,"I looked at several of these books, and liked the questions and layout of this one best. I ordered this one for my grandmother, however, I ordered the ""Grandparent's Legacy"" for my parents (soon to be grandparents). The ""Grandparent's Legacy"" is a lot nicer and looks a much higher quality. I really like the layout and it is a lot more in depth than most. But that one might be a little too lengthy or in depth for an older grandparent. ""Grandmother Remembers"" is shorter, simple, and to the point. With my 90 year old granny's failing eyesight and health, I felt it was a more appropriate book. But for someone who is still capable of filling out the journal style layout of the ""Granparent's Legacy"" book, it is definately the way to go and comprable in cost. I feel you get much more for the money."
3,Limited use,"While this is a great guide for a grandmother to share her life, it's very traditional. My in-laws are divorced and one has remarried and one has not. Therefore, this would have been an awkward book for them to try to navigate. It's not for everyone."
5,Grandmother Remembers,"I thought this was a fantastic way for my niece and nephew to have a ""keepsake"" of their Grandmother. It is a wonderful way to really get to know her and their family history."
4,A Grandmother remembers,I gave this book as a gift after using the Grandfather version for two of my grandchildren. The family history is extended to a new generation through this book given to the child when they are old enough to understand its value.It is a wonderful matrix to help the grandparent pass their memories on.
4,Grandmother Remembers,I received one as a gift and bought 3 more. I wanted a copy for each grandchild.
5,The Best Gift,"I gave these books to my mother and my husbands mother for mothers day! They are a great way to leave a part of themsleves to my little girl! My next step is to give one to my grandmother! They had such amazing lives, immagrating, witnessing tidal waves, rasing 17 children alone when your husband dies!! I never want these stories to be forgotten! This is how not to forget!"
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book for my husband's mother to give to our children. This book was not what I was expecting. I've purchased other ""grandparent journals"" in the past and this one just wasn't as good. It looks almost like a baby book or a story book. There aren't very many questions for the grandparents and the questions that there are aren't really worthy of having them spend so much time on it. I want them to enjoy filling it out as much as my kids will enjoy reading it, even when they get older. I did purchase two other books, ""A Grandparent's Legacy: Your Life Story in You Own Words"" and ""Memories for My Grandchild."" I would definitely recommend these books. Unfortunately it's going to cost me to return these books because it is not ""Amazon's error"", so I'm going to just hang on to them. I'm embarassed to give them to the grandparents, so I'm ordering more of the ""Grandparent's Legacy: Your Life Story in Your Own Words"" to give to them. I hope this helps future buyers."
4,Nice memento,I bought this to get ideas of what to ask my grandmother since I'm putting together my own family story. I got some ideas but it didn't really work for what I was trying to do. It is a neat gift if you are a grandmother or to give someone who is going to be a grandmother and then you fill out all the info and give it to your grandchild.
2,I like it very much!,"I have used these ""Grandmother Remembers"" books for eleven grandchildren and like them very much! Each grandchild has cherished them! They provide a way of having a ""history"" of my past."
4,"Many good qualities, but. . .","I like the idea of the book a lot. Many of the questions are good and allow one to say what they would like to say anyway. In some cases, however, questions are asked that are not applicable, and there are not questions to allow one to say certain things he orshe woul like to say. The writing inside the photo squares adn the prescribed shape for the picture were restrictive--many of mine did not fit the space well."
3,"Suitable for more ""traditional"" grandmother","I bought this book as a christmas present for my grandmother on my father's side. However, I ended up giving it to my grandmother on my mother's side because my father's parents are divorced. This book is something that my grandmother would have enjoyed, had it not had such a focus on her dating, engagement, marriage, ect. Questions like, ""What did he say when he purposed?"" and ""What would Grandpa want to tell the grandchild?"" could be very painful to recall and possibly unanswerable. It's a great gift for my OTHER grandmother, though. I wouldn't reccomend it for the non-traditional situation. Three stars because, I almost was unable to give it as a gift at all."
1,Sparce in Information,"This was not at all what I expected. There were very few questions about grandmother's life, but several pages on the family tree, and her child's (the grandchild's parent) life. I expected more on what grandmother remembered about her own life."
2,"Good for a month or so, then it may die","I got one of these to play with a while back... One day it just froze up. The twain software that comes with it was very slow, and would often freeze in the middle of what it was doing. And when it was working, It wasn't even worth the money just for something to mess around with. I had to send it back... Now I learned my lesson - save up your money, and get something decent!"
4,Good images for a VGA sensor.,"I have had this about a week. The quality of the images is the best I have seen for a 640x480 imager. Details show up well. Colors are sort of grey, but reasonable.Software it buggy -- disconnecting/reconnecting the USB cable with the camera on helps the twain software find the camera. I have not been able to get the PC-connected video camera feature to work, but basic image preview and transfer is fast with USB.Battery life seems good though I am not previewing to a TV on battery power."
1,WARNING! THIS CAMERA IS A LEMON!,"I bought this camera to take pictures for online auctions & ended up having to go back to getting regular film put on disks after WASTING TIME trying to get this digital camera working.What's worse is the COMPANY DOES NOT HELP!!The company wouldn't give me a toll-free number~Amazon did.No one picks up the phone at the company...You just get recording after recording while you are made to believe you are being connected to someone who will help.Emails to the company were answered with just links to their website, no personalized help.Then, when I thought I was about to get personalized help...the man never contacted me by email or phone!This camera may work on some other plane or planet...BUT THIS COMPANY SURE DOESN'T!!Unless you know everything there is to know about computers & digital cameras...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME(or money)!"
5,Good Christmas Special,"Why don't they make Christmas specials anymore? They are fun to watch. I have to disagree with one of the previous reviews a little. I think the Christmas spirit died in the entertainment industry in the 90s. That's when everything turned bitter and sarcastic. Nowadays, they'd rather make cheap, unwatchable reality shows than a good production. Oh well, we DO have dvds to enjoy, thankfully!I like Christmas programs and this one has music, dancing, and humor in it. I think people who put down this kind of show are either jealous or just don't know what good clean fun is all about. It makes you feel good.Recommended if you like watching something that has no foul language, no tasteless jokes, no bitter sarcasm, just corny humor at times. Safe for family viewing. You won't find this kind of thing on tv today. At least we can play our DVDs over and over."
1,The Donny and Marie 1978 Christmas Show,"This was not a very good Christmas Show, I was very disappointed."
2,The Donny and Marie 1978 Christmas Show,"I enjoyed the show, seeing the family together enjoying a good old fashioned Christmas was great. However, it was way to short, it seemed very chopped up and very poorly put together."
4,1978 Christmas,If you like good old fashioned entertainment with family values and a reminder of life in the 70's this is very entertaining.
3,"No stone guards in the made in Mexico set, German set yes.","I purchased two sets of these, one came with the stone guards and one did not. Later I noticed that one set was made in Germany and the other in Mexico. The German lights are better quality and came with the stone guards. What a bummer. It's a gamble. So that is why some people are saying they got the guards and the others are saying they did not in these reviews. Good luck"
5,"Great Light, Durable, Alot for the money, Happy with Hella Light","I shopped around and found this Hella 500 Light Kit on Amazon for close to Half of the cost anywhere else. I had my Mechanic install them, said it was easy for anyone who knows anything about installing parts on a vehicle. Took him about an hour, I have a land rover and bought an extra cruise control switch from Land Rover and placed it upside down on the left sid of the instrument cluster bezel, so it is a factory switch, no drilling needed to be done for the switch that is provided, it just snapped in and I was ready to use them. I would not have any hesitations about buying these lights. Keep in mind they are not spot lights, they are driving lights but they do put out alot of light. I have them mounted on the brush guard of an 02 Discovery, they look and work great."
2,"Disappointing -- too standard & stuffy, not very creative","I expected something much more creative. I also expected information more focused on second weddings kind of weddings. Not all the froo-froo stuff. There are a few interesting ideas; the bill of rights for weddings for grownups is great--it should have been the first thing she covered in the book. But while she says repeatedly to do it your own way, the information is geared to the very traditional wedding but without the checklists, etc. of other books. If you are looking for a traditional wedding, this book might be helpful. If you are looking for less stuffy, more individual--look for the Anti-bride Guide and Priceless Weddings Under $5,000 (and every couple, traditional or not, should find the book Bridal Bargains invaluable)."
1,Meh,"I must not have read enough wedding p.rn, because this book was nothing special. If you want to have a wedding, here's how to get invitations. If you want to...do...She said that dollar dances are not grown up. Wow, useful.I expected this book to be about making the wedding UNIQUE for your GROWNUP personality and selves. Instead it was more of the same old ""this is how you have a traditional American wedding."""
1,like a self-help book,"The author is a wedding planner and she basically provides a series of ancedotes that reads like a wedding self-help book. Not everyone is obsessed with having the ""perfect wedding"" and has to fend off ""snotty florists"". Snotty florists may be an issue for the New Yorkers she depicts, but certainly isn't the norm for everyone else. I guess the goal of the book is to give you confidence to do what you want, but there are much better books out there. I think getting a good wedding planning book and some bridal magazines is a much better investment."
2,"Got $30,000 to spend on your wedding?","If you don't, this book will make you feel like a cheap-skate. Opulent receptions in glamourous settings are the stars of this book. I don't recall if anyone detailed their actually ceremony, just their clothes and reception. Eeek.However, this book does have one saving grace. There's one teensy little sidebar that asks you to pick a limited number of adjectives that describe what type of wedding you want. I actually found this quite helpful, because it assists you in putting your plans into perspective. Check it out from the library, if this intrigues you.Otherwise, the rest is pretty much a pagent of black, gold and silver lame' that's very reminiscent of Oscar party photos. It's impressive, certainly, and perfectly obvious that the couple wanted what was ultimately to throw a big blow out party, but ... I guess it's a book on how to use money rather than personality to celebrate your wedding day. I don't recall one example of a couple using *both*."
5,A Great Job!!!!,"I loved that movie. This book gives you the in's and out's of the firearms used. Clothing is there, but I bought it for the weaponry. Peter did a fantastic job. Worth the price if you Love the Old West, and a really great movie."
4,A classic work on political socialization,"This is one of the earliest major research works on the study of political socialization, the process by which people come to learn about politics, develop political views, and become oriented toward the political system.The book is based on the results of interviews with New Haven children, conducted in 1958. It is a classic work in political socialization. The book explores kids' feelings about political authority, their development of political information, and the roots of party identification. The volume also considers how children's views may develop somewhat differently by socioeconomic status and sex. The book ends by looking at avenues for future research.I first read this book in graduate school in 1970. Even though it is a ""golden oldie,"" it is still a classic and worth examining to understand the roots of political socialization research."
4,Great Camera,"Got this for my girlfriend for our anniversary, she absolutely loved it. We had two friend's weddings to go to that weekend and it was perfect for it. So many cameras only have 3 zoom, it was nice to have 6 to get shots further away. The delay between shots is kinda slow but besides that its a great camera, and at a great price."
4,Happy,The camera is exactly what I ordered and it came in record time. I didn't pay for expedited shipping and still got it in less than the 5-7 days they stated.
4,The LZ-7 wallops competition.,"I purchased a Nikon L5 from Costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on Saturday after I saw the LZ-7. The LZ-7 is way better in all aspects than the Nikon L5, save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode.PROS: Takes great pictures; optical image stabilization; 6X zoom; and, great price. It is also made in Japan, not China as the Nikon L5 is.Cons: Fixed zoom while in movie mode; no on-board camera speakers."
5,GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE!,"A great point and shoot camera!I just finish shooting over 400 pictures this weekend (June 2007) and all of the pictures were great quality. Even my family was impressed with the quality of the photos. My cousin was surprised with a picture taken at night with little ambient light and using just the flash! Great battery life, easy to change scenery change mode, and ELECTRONIC ZOOM (great bonus feature).The ""con"" with the camera is that the view screen could be improved when looking at it in the sunlight, but overall A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE!!!"
3,important - no zoom in video mode!,"I ordered this camera after reading all the great reviews here and on other sites. I was even willing to accept the absence of voice playback on video mode. only after I received the camera did I understand that it is not possible to use the zoom while in video mode. to me, this is a deal breaker. the whole point of video is capturing the dynamics of a situation, where the activity is happening in general, and then zooming in on the action itself. in addition, many times the objects you are filming are moving closer or further away from you, and you want to compensate for that with the zoom. it is true- the image quality of the stills picture is very good, so if you are interested mainly in that - go for it, its a great camera. if you also plan on taking videos be sure to understand the limitations."
3,"Good Zoom, but too much noise","The camera is good, lens is strong and nice, but even at low ISO there is a lot of noise in the photograph. Video recording is also a bit flaky."
3,part of order backordered and still not received......,"good for price but hard to understand instruction booklet keeps it from being ""user friendly"" unless you want the factory presets."
1,A horrible product,Its a horrible product. When you zoom in it gets fuzzy and stays fuzzy. Pictures come out dark and its not a great product. I bought it because I've always enjoyed Panasonic products but this one stinks!!!!
4,great with one gripe,"Great camera, much better than the Canon Elph S500 been using prior. My only gripe is that it takes f o r e v e r to upload photos onto my four year-old laptop, insanely slow (presumably due to not having high-speed USB). Do not like the upload software at all, hard to follow."
3,Tradeoffs,"I decided to stick with the FX3 model- I like the much smaller size (pocket size), the real Leica lens, and the rechargeable battery. I don't use much zoom enough where the 6x vs. 3x matters to me and unless you're doing billboard posters 6meg vs. 7.2 meg is ridiculous. Most downsize resolution anyway to take less space and work easier in photo programs.All other features the same."
3,The camera is good for still photos and an occasional video,I settled for a DMC-TZ1 which offers:1) brighter picture in low light2) lens with a wider viewing area3) both optical and digital zoom during video recording4) audio may be heard on video playbackI wish the TZ1 used AA batteries and had a mode for continuous still frame shooting. The latter could be fixed if Panasonic would upgrade camera software features; probably to much of a tech burdon for the camera market.
2,Great Specs but not to the mark,"I got this camera for my family, I read the specs and was impressed, but when i took the initial snaps they were of no great quality. The resolution was preety bad as compared to 7 mp camera and lcd screen is of no great quality. Overall its not a good experience for me."
1,Total Disappointment,"At first sight, i loved its price, its look and i was gonna buy a panasonic at all so i went for it.. But the picture turned into a horror movie instead of ""Love Story"" once i have it in my hands.. Its lcd is horrible, memory is very small that in the first 10 mins of my NY trip, it got full, and the machine is not able to take ""visible"" pictures at all. And also its ""impossible to reach"" navigation menu... oh boy.. beware at all cost.. :("
5,quality camera,"I purchased this camera as a replacement for my deadCanon Powershot A520 4MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoomwhich was plagued with problems. The DMC-LZ7 functioned perfectly on the two trips I've taken it on, including a recent 3 week climb of Mount McKinley.It takes great photos, the menu system is easy to navigate and the LCD is bright enough to use outdoors. However, I do wish it had a viewfinder. Best of all it's not Made in China."
3,Good reviews - but check prices,"Having read the reviews, I am not sure why this model in black is nearly TWICE as expensive as the silver model (Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7S)???? Is this black a stealth model? ;-)Guess some vendors don't think we read the reviews?"
4,Nice Camera Nice Price,"I got this camera for my dad to replace his old Nikon digicam.This camera has great features for the price; 6x zoom and Panasonic's Mega Optical Image Stabilization. The movie mode is good, allowing wide screen recording.The not so nice features of this camera are that it tends to overexpose with the flash, and there is no zooming during movie recording."
5,Great Pictures!,"This truly is a user friendly camera. Just point and click and the camera does the rest. The clarity of the photos is great--and regardless of the light situations, the pictures come out clear and focused. However, the one thing I wish was included was an AV cord--the plug in the camera is so small, I have a feeling I am going to have trouble finding a universal one to fit. But you know what? For the quality of these pictures, and the absolute ease of use--I don't give a hoot."
4,7.2 MP Lumix Camera,"This camera is awesome that is all I've got to say, Thank you very much and I will keep buying!!!!!Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K 7.2MP Digital Camera with 6x Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)"
1,Round spots of photographs taken inside,I have returned the camera two times and Panasonic replaced the lens system both times but the camera continues to have round spots on pictures taken inside as it has from my orginial purchase. I have purchased several Panasonic products in the past but I am looking at other brands for my next purchase. I cannot believe Panasonic would market a product with its name on it and not be able to correct this problem.B. Deal
2,Picture quality not acceptable,"Nothing really wrong with the camera, but I bought it to take GOOD pictures. My old Canon camera took sharper, less washed out pictures, with more vibrant colors. Not really impressed. Buy a Canon."
3,Great Bang for the Buck!,"Simply put this somewhat compact camera offers what most don't for the price...expanded zoom, terrific pix and comfortable feel. I would recommend this product."
4,Camera,My last camera was a Kodak Easyshare (bought in 2003). This camera has a lot more features but pictures have more of a tendency to come out blurry. Haven't had any problems with it.
4,Real,"I enjoy the product, but the directions are sometime difficult to follow. You have to be kind of advance to know how to use. Not a good camera for a beginner. This camera is the best for its price due to its feature."
2,Shutter cover wont open,"Good camera, but the automatic shutter cover ceased to open after just three mnths of light use. Panasonic did stand behindtheir warranty although it needs to be sent off to Illinois for repair (I live on the east coast)."
1,Avoid this camera,"I bought this camera to take on trips, and for some general photography. I was aware of the bulk, and decided the zoom was an acceptable trade-off. What I was not prepared for, however, was the insane time between pictures, 20+ seconds. I initially thought it might be the batteries, changed those. Then I thought the flash, so tried some outdoor photos, same problem. Then I tried a different SDHC card, I had the low-end Sandisk 4GB card that is rated as too slow for this camera. I upgraded to a fast Sandisk SDHC card, it's double the requirement listed in the camera manual. The camera still experiences 20+ seconds between taking one picture and being ready for the next. Unless you plan to take pictures of buildings exclusively, plan on missing many opportunities while you wait for this camera..."
2,Very slow speed,"I returned this product after trying to use it and finding the camera speed totally unacceptable. After taking a picture, the camera displayed the image taken and then the screen went black for a few seconds before allowing another picture to be taken. I thought that it might just be my memory card so I checked one out at a local retail store and found it to be the same. I was also told by the salesperson that the delay is ""normal""."
2,"Slow, worst camera ever!","WE BOUGHT OVER A YEAR AGO AND HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED FROM DAY ONE. HORRIBLE SHUTTER SPEED, I MISS ALL THE CUTE SHOTS OF MY KIDS SMILING. THE COLOR QUAILITY IS RIDICULOUS. I HAVE READ & RE-READ THE MANUAL. HORRIBLE COLORS, VIDEO RECORDINGS ARE POOR QUALITY UNLESS THE LIGHTING IS PERFECT. SAVE YOUR MONEY. MY KODAK EASYSHARE POINT AND SHOOT DELIVERED MUCH BETTER RESULTS, TOO BAD WE RAN OVER IT WITH THE CAR!"
5,Best bang for your dollar!,Wow!!For the price you probably won't find a better choice of digitalcameras with these features and quality. The video and sound performanceis just as impressive as the still pictures!The Lumix series from Panasonic has matured to 7.2 Million Pixelsfrom it's original debut a few years back. I'm sure Panasonic willcontinue to refine an already exceptional camera in the Lumix seriesto come. It's no wonder the resale prices of this baby is near(and in some cases above) original retail.The only downside small as it may be is the included software. A littletricky to figure out but manageable to navigate through if yourthe patient type.Overall one of the best (of MANY I've tested) out there.You can get a Sony with some of the same features of equal quality andstamina but it will cost you WAY more.***** 5 Stars !
4,J.P dutta bring pakistan and india together in this one,out of all Refugee was the only film to bring together India and PAkistan Both shake hands together. and Refugee have it.The performance by every one was great from Jackie to suniel and from Abhiehsk to Kareena. all did a great job
3,Freeze your lips to the side,"Beautiful, hip, and cool in appearance. Make a really cold frozen drink (like a margarita) and find your lips stuck to the side of the metal. Use caution when drinking from them!I still use mine.... just warn your guests before they leave a layer of skin behind."
1,Structurally unsound,One of the glasses came delivered broken. The welding on the stem of the glass does not hold.
5,Stainless Steel Margarita glasses,"The stainless steel glasses are great. Not only to drink from, but they look nice hanging in my kitchen on our glass rack."
4,unique research sources,"These collections of actual interviews with former Plantation Slaves are an invaluable insight into American History. Too many times, we are caught up in the ""dramatization"" of history that is provided in film and literature. Here are the actual words of those who lived through the Civil War as slaves, and how they actually felt. I recommend them highly to any and all middle and high school history teachers to have for their students."
4,This is a great book!,This book was very intriguing. I love to learn about the lives of african americans and this was very helpful. The collection of interviews where great and I learned a lot from this book. I think that anyone who reads this book will enjoy it. That is all I have to say!
2,A little dry and confusing,"I have practiced ashtanga yoga for about 4 years and this CD, although is does a nice practice overall, I find is lacking in a few major respects. First of all, Cynthia Funk doesn't call any of the postures by their sanskrit names or English names - she only describes where you arms and legs are supposed to be which can be really confusing. It comes with an insert with all the of postures she does on the CD but it is wrong.Also, it is kind of an imcomplete practice although it is about 70 minutes long. It is a great workout but I prefer Vinyasa Yoga with Kimberly Wilson so much more than this CD."
3,Too slow!!!,"Cynthia Funk's instructions for the various positions are not clear at times. For instance, there are three poses on this CD that I can not figure out how to do, following her instructions. So, be sure not to misplace your illustrated examples of the poses! Also, her 5 breath technique is much, much slower than any Ashtanga class I have attended, making the practice more tedious than relaxing. However, this is the only CD I can find on Ashtanga yoga practice, so I use it quite often."
2,Screen hard to see,I purchase this for my bed ridden mother who loves to play solitaire. I had hoped this would provide her a chance to place solitaire in bed. Unfortunately the screen is small and difficult to read. As I looked for electronic games I found none that wee really suitable for the elderly and that is too bad.
2,Hand held toy,Need to have a back light... hard to see cards.... will often jump cards and you can not back up to pick up the missed card.
2,One minute is too short!,"This video zooms through each whole story in one minute. It's geared towards kids, but goes much too fast for them to comprehend anything."
5,These are great tabs!,"They're easy and fun to play tabs! I swear every guitar player should have this book! It's awesome! The difficulty level is easy, but the speed, well Blink's too fast! But, who cares, if it's easy and fun to play, get it!Includes:Dumpweed: some twists at the beginning, good guitar songDon't Leave Me: really fun to play, rock songAliens Exist: alot of bass in this, but good songgoing Away To College: The best song on guitar, pretty much. love the beginningWhat's My AGe AGain?: This song is hard to play. Especially the beginning, I've been playing it over a year, and still can't get it right! But the rest is easy!Dysentary Gary: alot of sliding, good songAdam's Song: every string's tuned down here, follow the book, and you'll like it!All The Small Things: easiest song in the bookThe Party Song: Not the greatest song for tabbing, but it'll doMutt: awesome song, with twists and turnsWendy Clear: nice song, not too difficult but really fastAnthem: good up beat song!Get this book!"
3,"Well, He Aint Krakauer","I read this book while stranded in an hosteria during a storm in Patagonia. How much more perfect can the situation be? I totally appreciate the passion Crouch conjures, but you can only hear the same old cliches so many times before you realize the author doesn't have anything else to offer. Yes, he loves climbing. Bravo. A lot of people love climbing, and a lot of people sacrifice a comfy job and home in order to satisfy that addiction. Crouch is trying to pave his climbing with a book that just doesn't quite measure up. He has some lovely passages, but if I were reading them from my apartment in Seattle rather than the aforementioned atmospheric perch in Chalten, Argentina, they wouldn't mean anything. That's the true measure of the book. Read it if you're an alpine junkie (or trapped by the Patagonian winds in Chalten), but otherwise, don't bother."
5,Some of the best adventure writing I have read,"Crouch does an excellent job of bringing the reader into the obsessive world of hard core mountaineers. His writing is exciting , crisp, and vivid. You feel his enthusiasm for his sport and can understand the sacrifices people like him make to climb the world's most challenging peaks. Anyone with an interest in adventure travel or outdoor sports will enjoy this book."
4,One funky 80's group!,"Skyy was one of the funkiest groups during the 80's decade. Songs like ""Let's Celebrate, and Call Me"" remind me of my roller skating days back in the early 80's. Those were classic dance grooves. However, i couldn't rate this cd collection 5 stars, simply because the tracks ""Start of a Romance, Real Love and Let's Touch"" were left off of this compilation. I understand that the group had changed record labels by that time, but come on, if you're going to do a compilation on any artist or group, especially an anthology, put all of the songs and hits on it. Don't short change the music fans. That's almost like an cardinal sin."

3,great series,"I find this program wonderful, I have it on vhs. I feel this is good series and it give fair picture of the Celts people of Europe. When I buy it back in late 1990's it cost mt over 100 buck back then."
3,Arrived OK and on time but no way to test it,"Our old backup battery for our sump pump died in the middle of the last hurricane when it was most needed. So I got this one since it is from a good company and is advertised for this purpose. It arrived on time, in good condition and already charged. There were no specs or instructions that came with it, so we just connected it into the old circuit with the old charger. it starts up the pump when we test it, but there is no way to know how long it will last when the power is down and the water keeps coming in. This is the reason I only give it 3 stars, and there are no specs."
1,Not available,"I'd rate it if I had ever received it. Rather than shipping in 5-7 days, it was 63 days before I cancelled my order. I've heard bits of it, and it's excellent - the 1 star is for customer service on this one."
