2,Maybe it's good for cruising sailboat owners...,"As a new owner of a 25 foot powerboat, I was eager to delve into this book and learn about the systems on my boat. The description here led me to believe that this book would be pertinent.I did not find it helpful. The author excludes outboard motors from discussion. Six of the ten chapters don't pertain at all to boats like mine: Engine Basics (because outboards are excluded), Freshwater Plumbing, Marine Toilets, Stoves, Sinks, and Refrigeration, Sailboat Rigging, and Getting Ready for the Big Trip.Relatively few new boat owners begin with a boat of a size that typically includes such features. If the description had more accurately described what one would find inside, I would have saved my money."
4,Well worth it,Easy to install and add lots of extra lights where you needed them. Like the looks of them and were not expensive
5,Passionate and earthy,"This is possibly the first CD that de Lucia and Camaron recorded together. Although they were both very young (19-21) at the time, they show a great deal of artistic expression and technical virtuosity. This is unadulterated, absolutely pure flamenco. Highly intense and emotional - a must have for the lover of traditional flamenco."
2,so so,I never got involved in this book. Found the characters boring/repetitious... had to force myself to finish about thee-quarters into it.
2,DISAPPOINTING GARDAM,"Loved ""Old Filth"" and ""Pineapple Bay"".Tambourine is a little disorganized for my taste. Some very vivid and insightful segmants interlaced with long pointless passages.The reader can really relate to some areas, but there are too many vague descriptive pages that, frankly, bored me.Next I will read ""Wooden Hat"" and reconnect with the ""Old Filth"" friends."
4,Pretty good,"Overall great game, the greatest thing about the game would be the mod ""Project Reality"" that itself makes up the game. But it is fun and if you like fps its something you should really try."
2,Support please?,"I decided to purchase the deluxe edition instead of 2142 because my friends still play BF2. Well, the original works fine. I don't think it's as good as Counter Strike, but it makes up for it being able to fly, drive and all that.Anyways, the problem I have is updating. It will not update to the latest version. So my options on which servers I can play on are pretty limited. I've tried reinstalling, re-downloading the patch. Nothing in the KB has worked. EA won't give any further support on their game, I'm guessing because of the 2142 release. Which, even with the spyware, I'm kinda regretting not buying that instead. I just don't see this game being worth the money and effort.I don't think I'll be purchasing many more games from EA unless I need a NFL licensed football game."
1,Program Sucks,I've never been able to get the program to run. Try to run it and the screen goes blank. Sent EA an email to cust. support and never got a reply. I will not buy anything else from EA.
3,A mixed bag,"I'm a Calvino mark. Simply said, I love the man's writing! This, however, is a mixed bag, in my opinion. A truly interesting theme (stories about the senses) the only one I really liked was the story dealing with the sense of smell (""The Man, The Nose"" I believe.) Its not that the others weren't imaginative or beautifully crafted, but I just felt as if something didn't click for me. The first two tales about the sense of taste and the sense hearing were a little too... self-indulgent, perhaps? It is somewhat difficult to articulate. All in all, this is suitable more for the true Calvino fan, rather than as an introduction or the casual reader. The one lasting impression I drew from the collection was, ""What about sight and touch?"" Maybe next time around."
5,Calvino takes you on a journey through your senses!!!!,"The ear, the smell and the taste (unluckily Calvino died before writing the other two) give place to three incredible stories. After reading this book you will discover that the human organs are more than just that. The senses are not just instruments to go around in life, if we take them to their highest consequenses life appears to be completely different, new, renewed. This book it's a must!!!!"
5,Heater,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. He loves it! Heats up his garage in no time. You do need to provide some form of ventilation though.
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"I read this book when it was first published in paperback and was mesmerized from beginning to end. The storyline is eminently feasible (even more so today!) and keeps the reader guessing which diabolical twist the story will take next. Like many others, I lent my copy to a friend who wanted to read ""something good"" and I never saw it again. It would make many avid readers, like myself, very happy if the publishers would reprint this book and many of his other titles as well. He is a marvelous author and has always provided me with hours of enjoyment when reading his novels. He is truly one of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Intense,erotic and thrilling","I have read alot of books in my life and out of them all,this was one of my all time favorites! Even though it's been at least fifteen years since I've read it,I can remember almost every detail.I can't understand why great books like that go out of print! Like every one else, I loaned it out to a friend and never got it back.I think that I'll just have to search the library!I don't think that it was ever made into a movie but I can't see how a movie could ever do the book justice!"
2,Second-time around,"I read The Fan Club in hardback when it first came out. I kept my copy of the book all these years because it remains one of my all-time favorite reads. I am now reading it again, and it intrigues me now just as it did all those years ago. As I am reading it, I keep trying to figure out which movie star Wallace might have had in mind when writing it."
2,basic chords and no practice,Unfortunately there's not a lot of instructional dvd for mariachi music. This one presents only basic chords that you might already know anyways and hardly shows how to play them in mariachi music. There's not enough practice. Save your money and don't buy this dvd if you already know the basics of the guitar playing.
5,FANTASTIC,"I am one of those people who gets eaten alive when no one else gets a single bite. I literally got over a dozen bites when I was waiting for a bus for less than 5 minutes (yes, this is in a city, doesn't make it any better). Needless to say I was skeptical, especially since citronella candles are generally pretty useless, but it worked like a miracle! I've tried it on my ankles (I get most bites on my legs) and on my wrist, and I have never got bit ONCE. It's totally amazing. I stored it in a ziplock bag and it lasted for nearly two weeks (although the package says it will last for about one week). HIGHLY recommended from a highly satisfied, very tasty (to mosquitoes) Amazon customer."
5,The best wireless handset I've owned in 10 years,"How long have I owned it? 2 years.How long have I used it? 2 years.Is this the only wireless handset I've used in the past two years? Yes.Did I have a negative perception of the Audiovox brand name prior to purchasing it? Yes.Do I have a negative perception of the Audiovox brand name today? No, definitely not.Pros:-display-durability-battery life-contacts/phone book-picture and video quality-media gallery/picture storage-voice dialing capacity-voice dialing recall accuracy-countdown timer tool-scheduler tool-auto answer customability-variety of pre-installed ringtones (ringer types)Cons:-speakerphone-voice dialing setup (must ""train"" it for each entry)"
5,Highland Bandsaw,I own an obsolete band saw and when it comes to buying blades it is difficult. Highland was the answer. installed and up and running.
5,Brith of Frankenstein,"This was the breakthrough movie for Hammer studios and caused a storm of outrage among the critics. Peter Cushing is the Baron and he so completely absorbed in his project where he thinks of nothing else. Christopher Lee has the role of the creature. Because the creature is mute, Lee was able to convey emotional turmoil through physical gestures.In Hammer's version of Frankenstein it is the Baron that is kept alive from film to film in contrast to Universal's version where the creature was kept alive through the series.This was the 1st British horror movie in color.The next film in the series is The Revenge of Frankenstein."
4,Hammer's first Frankenstein,"THe Curse of Frankenstein is quite an interesting film that borrows plots from both the novel and Universal's classic. The only thing here that is superior to Universal's Frankenstein is Peter Cushing. His performance as Dr. Frankenstein is uncanny, with the right amount of both evil and good. Sure, he's a [bad], but you still end up liking him! Christopher Lee's Creature, on the other hand, isn't as iconic as Boris Karloff's, and the look is pretty forgettable. There is no sympathy felt for this monster. At least The women are excellent."
4,A Thousand Bucks???!!!!!,"Here is where the Hammer legend was born. It all started with this delightful slice of mild horror. And, as we all know, the name Hammer stood for sumptuous, low budget horror that always had grand style, visual opulence and fine star performances. Better was to come but this is a full-blooded, full colour feast with Cushing and Lee in their heyday. My main reason for adding this soft focus review was to have a go at the despicable folk who are offering a copy of this DVD for close on $1,000.00. Oh dear, such bare-faced greed is beyond comprehension."
1,"Slow, slow ........ very slow !","I have never liked this extremely poor version of the 'Frankenstein' myth. Made by Hammer Films in 1957 this is such a watery story. The acting is great from all the cast particularly Cushing. For me though the story just fails completely. For one thing it takes a good 40 odd minutes to get going, with lots of thumb twiddling moments to endure. I know that people love a good story and well most horror movies from this era certainly have this (See Hammer's 1958 Dracula), but this lacks any sort of build up and when the Creature finally appears it is a complete let down (Looking like the result of a custard pie fight!), and for me the whole film is a really dull anti - climax. Much better and with a heck of a lot more atmosphere is Hammer's version of 'Dracula', which is spot on with suspense, story and genuine horror."
4,Good film,"This is a pretty good frankenstein movie. It probably won't scare you much compared with movies being released today, but it's still a fun film. The acting is top notch, and I love Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. It's interresting to see a Frankenstein film where the doctor himself is evil. The monster definitly takes a backseat to the doctor in this movie. So if you're looking for a film to really scare you, you might pick something else. If you just enjoy the horror genre and enjoy an interresting adaptation of the Frankenstein story, this is just right."
4,I like it better than Hammer's Dracula,"The first of Hammer's monster movies, this one is less known today thanHorror of Dracula. Both star Peter Cushing (here as Baron Frankenstein) and Christopher Lee (as the creature). Personally I like this one better than Dracula. Peter Cushing is given more opportunity to shine in this role than he got as Van Helsing, and the Jimmy Sangster's script is well written and character driven. There are many great scenes between Viktor Frankenstein and his mentor, Paul. And Christopher Lee is a good creature, very different from that of Karloff. Recommended for all horror fans."
5,The film that saved Hammer Studios,"I can recall being 10 years old and seeing Curse of Frankenstein on the big screen for the first time playing a double feature with Horror of Dracula. With all due respect to the 1931 James Whale version, this treatment of Shelly's novel (albeit freely adapted)ignited my passion in this genre still prevalent and near mania to this day. The superb acting talents of Peter Cushing (Victor Frankenstein) and Christopher Lee (the Creature),et al, beautiful photography and lavish sets (used multiple times in future creature features)left me wide eyed and thirsting for more. This DVD rekindled my affection for the classic works issued by Hammer Studios in the late 50's and early 60's. The rich colors (or should I say colours?), remastered photography, widescreen formatting, and make this DVD a must have for all horror film aficionados. I would suggest purchasing the DVDs now, lest they disappear as did the Universal Horror DVDs."
5,mind heavy mustard rules!,mind heavy mustard rules but ive never heard about buffmuffin.im sure it rocks!
5,AWESOME PERUVIAN MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PERUVIAN MOVIE. IT FOCUSES ON THE LIFE OF ""M"" WHO WANTS A DECENT LIFE BUT CAN'T GET A JOB OR AN EASIER LIFE TO LIVE IN, HE IS PRESSURED BY HIS FRIEND PACHO TO LIVE A LIFE OF CRIME BY EARNING EASY MONEY BY DELIVERING COCAINE TO MIAMI. THE ACTING ON THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD. IN MANY OF THE SCENES ESPECIALLY DURING THE STRONG ARGUMENTS WHERE I WAS LIKE ""MAN I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THESE GUYS"". ""M"" AND HIS FRIENDS MAKE THE DUMB MISTAKE BY PARTYING WHILE DRINKING ALCOHOL, EATING AND DOING DRUGS A FEW HOURS BEFORE SUPPOSED TO BEING AT THE AIRPORT GETTING ON A PLANE TO MIAMI WITH FAKE PASSPORTS. I MEAN HOW THE HELL ARE THEY GOING TO SWALLOW COCAINE RIGHT AFTER DOING ALL THOSE THINGS? THEY'L HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST 12 HOURS TO HAVE EVERYTHING DIGESTED BECAUSE THE ACIDS ON THEIR STOMACH WILL DESTROY THE SPECIAL BAGS. THEIR OWN MISTAKES LEADS THE STORY TO A VERY UNEXPECTING ENDING. WILL THEY MAKE IT TO MIAMI, WATCH THIS MOVIE TO FIND OUT!"
1,Bad Choice,I really had high hopes this product would work with my sun glasses. It simply did not. There was no way to position the mirror on the curved lense to see anything but your face. Save your $10.00 and buy something else that works.
1,Inadequate,"I used this on one ""test"" ride & could not get it in position & what view I had was inadequate. I purchased these as it is getting more & more difficult for me to turn & view to the rear when making turns."
2,must have contacts,this thing only works if you weear contacts because the go in the inside of the glass... sad to say i have prescription sunglasses and this was useless for me
1,"It works, but barely","I rarely write reviews. When I do, it is because a product is really good or REALLY BAD. I tried mounting this thing 20 different ways, and finally came to the conclusion that it works, but it works very poorly. This thing is in the trash, and I am now using a Take a look mirror. That mirror works well, but this thing is just throwing your money down the drain. Trust me on this one!"
3,Depends on the Glasses,The glasses I used wrap around too much so the point at which the mirror had to be mounted was too close to the face and my eyelashes touched the mirror. I was surprised how usable they were even though the mirror is so small.
2,Not a serious primary mirror.,"If you rely on your mirror for safety in traffic, this is not for you. I tried it for maybe six one hour rides and could not feel comfortable with it. You have to turn your head about 45 deg left then shift your eyes toward the mirror and try to adjust your view. Takes too much attention away from the road in front of you."
1,pretty cheap and not worth the price,Dont get these they dont fit just any pair of sunglasses. Doesnt stick very well either. Waste of money. I wish i could get my money back for this one.
2,Not For Users of Wrap Around Glasses.,"Unlike the edited photo put up by Cycleaware they do not come with glasses which is not make Clear. With that in mind this is not for persons who use wrap around sunglasses, with are safer, as the lens does need to be able to have a view behind you and will not. Also If you have perscrpition Glasses it is also not functional as you will not have your corrected vision for rear view mirror. Posted photos to show packaging."
5,wouldn't leave home without it,"I have used one of these for perhaps 10 years and it works extremely well for me. Having said that, it can be challenging to adjust. Case in point: I recently got new glasses and it took me perhaps a dozen attempts before I got the mirror in a good location so I could see back by slightly turning my head."
1,Useless product,Seems like good idea. Tried for an hour to adjust the mirror and still unable to see anything adequately. Would not recommend at all.
4,"Very handy mirror, give it some time.",I have been using button mirrors for years and really like them.Always there. Stable image. Doesn't get bumped out of alignment when you take your helmet off. You can pan you head and see a wide view. I use this for bike racing and can look around corners behind me for example.This one is a little better than the Mirricle. The Viewpoint is better quality and slightly larger. I use my belt sander to take a little off the thickest part of the wedge shaped base. This allows easier adjustment. I am going to try Sandkeyfred's installation advise without modification. It takes a week to get comfortable with using this mirror so don't give it up the first day.I also work on road construction projects and have one of these installed in my safety glasses so I can see behind while walking with traffic.
2,did not work for me,"I don't know if it was the type of glasses or my older eyes, but this just didn't work for me. I went with the mirrycle shifter mount road mirror instead."
5,If Mckeown truly is a guru that makes me a follower,"Understanding the e-customer: sounds familiar BUT going through the book gives us the feeling we've just been in the parallel universe of the Matrix surrounded by the bright colours and sounds of MTV. It has a life of its own, truly has captured the soul of the e-customer. After the journey (reading) we are left with star trek expectations and what's wrong with that? Once someone said `ideas do change the world', well here it is a book full of those. If Mckeown truly is a guru that makes me a follower."
2,Review,"Author tends to jump from one topic to the other and tends to introduce too many characters at a time which is very hard for the reader to keep track of. Title says something about ""Defending the Crown"" but the book devotes a mere chapter to it.I gave it 2 stars as the topic is very interesting but book falls short on presentation."
5,great book!,"Even after finishing this book, I pick it up once a week and read a few chapters. Great advice that really works."
4,Parent's Tao Te Ching,"Lovely book that I had sent to my daughter, a busy Mom who works in Manhattan, gets home at 7 to care for her 8 year old daughter!"
1,another example of not the tao te ching,"The 2,500 year old tao te ching is a mysterious book to read and then put down and make it your own truth. If you care to apply the original to one thing or another, that is fine. But should it be fit to a pop culture ""modern parenting""? I do not think so."
5,Parent's Tao Te Ching,Much wisdom for all parents. I revisit this book periodically as a parent of adult children and a grandparent.
5,Helps To Stay Centered as a Parent,"These verses have been an invaluable help in staying calm and focused through the ups and downs of parenting a teen. Turning to this book in times of stress has helped me avert more than one argument or harsh word, and keep things in perspective. I have read it again and again. It reminds me of the reality that I can not control every aspect of life for my teen or protect her from all pain, but I can keep myself right-minded and be a good model for living.The book may be best for those who already have an understanding of Taoism."
4,mixed bunch,"There is no real surprise that this is a mixed bag of pieces. There are some really good ones, some really, really good ones, but there are also a lot of dull or pointless pieces. A lot of it comes across as dry, but hey, it is still worth the price. And it is a debut collection, and these always get better as time goes and the editor and others become more experienced."
3,3 times ***** is a bit much...,"I was in the process of listening to my old vinyl copy of this very album (yes, Kristen, it has a bonus two-track 7"" single) and while contemplating to sell it, I did a bit of research on the Web, only to find these three five star reviews of the set.Well, I am not as enthusiastic.I don't see any Rolling Stones, Cream (but I never cared much about Cream, past 'Sunshine Of Your Love') or RHCP in this album. Musically, one clear reference spot is early Love or, at a push, early Doors. But only rawer and without any organ. And without any Arthur Lee or Jim Morrison.It is a pleasant enough album and I dare say opener 'Don't Say Goodbye' awaits for the fourth installment in Rhino Records' ""Nuggets"" series. But I would hardly call it ""a criminally neglected album"" or ""a rare gem"". A ""neglected gem"", perhaps?"
1,Possible fake,"I have been using L'Anza Healing Strength shampoo for a while and it does wonders for my fine hair - especially in the winter. I normally buy it directly from my stylist but as I was running low between appointments I decided to buy it from Amazon instead. This particular shampoo seems quite different from the product that I normally use so I'm wondering if it's a fake. This is surprising given that it's supposedly sold from L'Anza.This shampoo that I bought from Amazon is much runnier and the smell is a little different. It seems almost as if it's been watered down. Also, and more importantly, my hair doesn't feel as conditioned with this particular product. I recommend people buy direct from a stylist or a more reliable source. I certainly won't be buying this on-line again."
2,"Not much ""wrestling""","This should not be called backyard wrestling. Instead it should be called backyard weapon fights. Hardly any of these matches use actual wrestling just striking with weapons. There are some, well actually only about 3 or 4 of the ""matches"" that showcase actual wrestling. Im talking about anything with the guys Kaos and M Dogg 20 in it."
5,a treasure for dance CD collectors,"Between the hard to find remixes and a substantial selection of hot Bollywoood vocal tracks you may not have heard otherwise, the first compilation of Dance Mix Let's Twist is a treasure for dance CD collectors."
4,*LET YOUR IMAGINATION TAKE WING with childlike delight*,"It would be too bad if author Miriam Chaikin and illustrator Hiroe Nakato are not acquainted and on their way to a true friendship. Their work is combined in this truly happy book, ""Don't Step on the Sky."" It is ""a handful of Haiku"" for children, small in size and illustrated in spritely, colorful watercolors.Haiku is sometimes quirky in a way that nudges the imagination - - its 'rules' are not rigid and thus unleash a child'd language like kites:""After the rain a puddle.Careful.Don't step on the sky.""According to illustrator Hiroe Nakato, ""THE IDEAL LIFE IS TO HAVE HAIKU EYES AND SENSES"" and that is lovely, serious goal for a healthy, contented hife. Read & Enjoy; Read Aloud to Children, then savor their JOY!commentary-with-a-small-""c"" by mcHaiku"
1,Mattel has made Barbie Unattractive again.....,"Again, the newer Barbie dolls have oversized heads and eyes that look like decals. There are overdone painted lashes, and no upper ridge to make the eye look three dimensional. Also, there is too much pink and purple paint around eyes and cheeks. Please go to EBAY, and type in a year from 1967 to 1979 with the word Barbie in order to look up the dolls from those years, and you will see more normal sized heads and less obnoxious face paint. These newer dolls have not recovered from the outlandish and foolish looks of the mid 1980's. Please ask Mattel to consider changing the face and head back to the 1977 doll with a more realistic face."
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful Bride Barbie is a the most pretty barbie ever!!! I am re-getting her for Christmas and the Handsome Groom Ken doll with Tooth Time Kelly,Beach Time Kelly,and Tinkle Time Kelly along with the nursery set and using the baby as their baby and the Kellys are their children too! I also the the Barbie Bed and Fashion Playset and using the nightgown as the babies' bedding and putting bunny slippers in the window of my pink and blue dollhouse with a lilac door and white floors and is called a ""Barbie Cathedral."" I am spray'painting the nursery's bedding chair and dollhouse pink and I also am getting the Barbie Decor bedroom, bathroom living room and kitchen!"
4,The Temple Scrolls,"I picked up this book expecting just another mediocre book... Boy was I surprised! The story had just the right amount of humor, along with intrigue and even a good look at a Christians life in action! Great reading."
5,This is a great story!,"Since I live in South Carolina, I've always been interested in books set in the South. I loved reading Sea Chase. Once I started it, I found it hard to put down. As I read each word it was easy to envision every detail of this historical romance. The chemistry between the hero and heroine was intriguing and I felt as if I'd been swept back in time. I would highly recommend Sea Chase to anyone, and look forward to reading more books by this author."
3,not great,most of the stories told here I had seen before. nothing special for me here. I should give it a 2 star rating.
2,Not what I expected.,Too much of the dude who found the Titanic looking for sunk WW2 ships... some which they didn't find yet spent a lot of time covering. I was wanting a more historical approach.
1,"""regifting""; ""used""; ""scratches on DVDs"" -$3.00 Special Return?","If people are going to return DVD purchases to get the $3.00 credit*, then Amazon has an absolute moral responsibility to indicate on the web page that the product is used/returned.*I think this is incredibly stupid. You should give it to your public library or other do good entity in your community.I bought the Criterion edition of ""Seven Samurai"" (kind of expensive for me) but there is no way in hell am I going to return it for a $3.00 coupon!Seven Samurai: The Criterion Collection (Three-Disc Edition). There is a segment where one of the true samurai knocks off 3 or 4 bandits lickity split and the young wannabe samurai goes to him and in Japanese with english sub-titles, blurts out ""you were magnificant!"". So, we don't have to ponder how American producers came up with the name, ""The Magnificant Seven"" for their Mexican based movie.Amazon people: When are you going to put a spell checker in the review section?"
4,brutal deathmetal that will eat you alive!,"The production on this was not the best in the world! But it was there first demo release, There 2 cd chorazonic chaos gods as a much better production. But anyway buy this one you won't be sorry!"
2,A bit misleading,"I am not a supporter of the ""Jehovah's Witness"" religion (or any religion for that matter). But the one thing that I will say here is that the group(s) associated with the Watch Tower Society over the years made a huge metamorphous shortly after 1916 and the death of Pastor Russell (it is ABSOLUTELY not the same group), and from then on have been in a continual state of change (Proverbs 4:19). So trying to draw a continuous line of change, as relating to ONE particular group (the ""Jehovah's Witnesses"") is misleading, and a trap that many ex-JW's and others fall into. That appears to be the case with this book. It is not as simple as demonstrating ""contradictions"" that have taken place over a hundred and some years."
1,quotes are wrong,"Well, I have not read this particular book, but I looked up the supposed quotes, and they are not reputable. Just a small example was listed by someone stating that the book ""Insight on the Scriptures"" says that the men of sodom will not be resurrected. None of those words appear on that page to even come close to that thought. If you are looking for errors, try the 1611 King James bible with its 22,000 errors. At one time people thought the world was flat, but time and human growth found that to be an erroneous thought. We all make mistakes and with time we correct them. In God's own due time, he will force everyone on earth to know exactly who he is. Those who are obedient to HIM will find themselves under his protection. Those who disobey will not see life. Stop looking for things to argue over, that just makes a person a hypocrite. 2 Timothy 2:24 says that ""a slave of the lord does not need to fight."""
1,A book that fails,"I try and keep an open mind, but the authors of this book clearly already had their mind made up long before they wrote this book. I guess the thing that strikes me most about this book is that the authors could not find one positive thing to say about these Jehovah's Witnesses in their entire publication.While some may have different beliefs, a more balanced viewpoint is definitely needed. These authors were not balanced, they were out to discredit the witnesses at all costs.Don't buy this book if you want to hear both sides, but feel free to buy it if you are interested in a one-sided view."
4,Great if you're looking for original Watch Tower quotes,"This book is made up entirely of JW quotes from authoritative works, especially the Watchtower magazines. If you are doing research and want to look some things up, this work is very handy. It would not be a good book just to pick up and read, but it does offer a variety of quotes on everything from the predictions of Christ's return to blood, birthdays, and salvation. I like having the quotes...yet I only wish there was a way to see these quotes in their context (photocopies?). Also, some quotes were not in quotation marks, making me wonder if some of them were paraphrases rather than word-for-word quotes. But otherwise, a good resource to keep on hand."
4,Today is a Friday.A fool borns every minute in the World,"In late XIX Century, a then famous american called P. T. Basrnum told:""A fool borns every minute, in the World"".The watchtower is a despicable american cult, who gets money from fools.This book is about the enormous mistakes maden by watchtower, between 1879 and 1989.About this subject, this book is excellent.Why I won't give 5 stars for this book?Because this book covers until 1989 year.We are in 2007 and since 1989, watchtower made terribles failures again.Even so, about watchtower's errors, no other book I know is so good as this book.I hate all cults and watchtower is among the worst of them."
5,Web of Fear -- based on a true story,"I enjoyed reading ""Web of Fear"" and especially appreciated the character of Marcia. I found her to be spirited, energetic and to have generally effected many admirable qualities. When Lazarz (her true love) finally contacted Marcia for the first time after she had not heard from him in weeks; I started to cry ""happy"" tears; that was not the only time I found myself crying. I have never had a reaction to a book like this before. It was wonderful. I especially loved the ending. Kudos to the author!"
4,Caught by Web of Fear,"Knowing this story was based on actual events drew me to this book, but the skill with which the story unfolded kept me turning pages. The heroine has no one to trust in modern Poland where she seeks the man she has loved and lost. At the same time, it soon becomes clear, someone is seeking her. Is it friend or foe, or both? Her search takes us from the height of holy shrines to the depths of the fabulous Polish salt mines where danger lurks behind every shadow. The ending is a surprise worthy of the suspense."
4,Good basic book to review concepts,This book starts with some basic prewritting skills and coloring. Lots of coloring in the book. The second section moves to writing and counting objects (along with more coloring- builds the fine motor skills). My child loves to do a page or two each day. Overall a good purchase for to practice. I would say this is a good Preschool/PRE-K (My daughter is 4) book but I would want a more advanced book for my daughter prior to Kindergarden.
4,D20 modern future,The product is very good and very helpful in future campaigns in d20 modern.The resources and the various tech levels are very precise and do not lack any imagination.I really enjoyed reading the book and it filled me with a whole new ideas for my modern campaign.I think it really deserves the four stars.
4,Epic,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for futuristic settings...A lot of the rules in this are rather incomplete in my opinion. However I generally house rule nearly everything anyway and just use books like this as inspiration; so incomplete rules don't bother me. I wouldn't consider this book a rulebook because of that and more of an idea or reference book. But again, I work well with that.If you don't particularly like books that have parts that do nothing or you want a rulebook that integrates perfectly right out of the box, don't get this."
1,Wild!!!,Not a happy customer. Looks much better in the picture. This looks like something I will let my 4yr old daughter play with. Normally I go for the real thing and pay the expensive price and be happy. The first and last time I will ever decide to take the cheap way out. The braclet looks like some plastic sliver balls thats on a plastic string with the clap waiting to break and any given moment..What I paid for just the shipping should have been the price for the braclet. Never again!!!

3,Earl Bostic - Saxophone Master,"I am a saxophonist myself, and originally checked out Bostic along with King Curtis & Big Jay McNeeley when I was trying to get that 'rock'n'roll', r'n'b sound. After listening, though, it became clear that Bostic was in another league entirely, and I now consider him to be one of the most under-rated musicians of the modern era. As a saxophonist, his name should be in the hall of fame, and remember he was also in high demand as an arranger (e.g. Cab Calloway, Louis Prima).His sound is big, bold and happy, full of sax 'special effects'. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I love it. His musical knowledge is evident in hearing him 'play the changes' as well as the most celebrated jazzers.If you are considering buying this album, stop dithering and just buy it!"

4,Worth it for the Pad Thai recipe,"This is a great cookbook -- I love eating Thai food in restaurants, but it's hard to feel comfortable as a vegetarian, since I know there's often still fish sauce in foods marked 'vegetarian'. Everything I've tried from this cookbook tastes wonderful and authentic. As others have said, it's not for quick meals, especially since many recipes require home-made curry paste.In response to the reviewer who wondered if this cookbook was on the short side because of its vegetarianism -- removing fish paste/fish sauce from Thai food is non-trivial, since it's in almost everything. In some dishes, it mainly adds salt, and soy sauce can (and is) a usual substitute. Others, I'd imagine, just don't taste right without it. That said, I'd love it if this cookbook were longer, since what it includes is wonderful.If you're not vegetarian, the same author has a non-veggie thai cookbook as well. (According to the specs, it's a few pages shorter, but I haven't looked at it.)"
5,real thai indeed!,This is a GREAT cookbook. I've just recently turned vegetarian and was worried that in doing so I wouldn't be able to enjoy thai food anymore but his cookbook makes it easy! The recipes are VERY authentic and oh so tasty! I made the satay with grilled vegetables (marinated) with a sweet/sour cucumber salad last night and let me just say YUM! I'm very pleased and glad I have this cookbook in my collection
5,How much more reassurance do you need? This is exceptional!,"To date, all of the reviews here grant four or five stars to this book - and I am no exception. This little red book contains the most delicious selection of vegetarian Thai recipes that I have encountered in my 15 years of cooking vegetarian meals. Not only are the recipes quite easy in preparation, but they also are based on easily available ingredients and are very quick to make. The outcome is almost always exceptional - both in taste and presentation. I can wholeheartedly recommend this book as a valuable addition to anyone's collection of cookbooks. As you can see from the other reviews, I am not alone. So, what are you waiting for? It's rare to find such a unanimously positive opinion about anything."
5,Each recipe is more tantalizing than the other! Do get it!,"I have tried about seventy percent of the recipes in this book - sometimes even substituting ingredients - and yet had success each and every single time. Friends and family think I took classes in Thai cooking - thanks to the authoress, for a truly wonderful book! Also I did not realise how much better the food tastes - I suspect most restaurants do use a 'tad-bit' of fish-sauce or oyster-sauce - because without these, I find my dishes turn out with richer flavours and taste.I do wish there were pictures in colour though, because after all, isn't half the fun in cookbooks about lusting at the beautifully laden dishes, having your mouth water and then rushing in a frenzy to cook 'em up and dig your hungry paws (um, I mean chopsticks) in 'em :)?"
3,"A great idea, but somewhat limited and dissapointing.","I bought this book and was truly excited about it. The author has what seems to be real knowledge about Thai cuisine, having been a Peace Corps volunteer in Thailand. However, in the end, there's just not much here in the way of recipes. Perhaps it's a good start if one has never cooked Thai. However, other Thai cookbooks I have seen are so much broader with so many more recipes, and I was hoping to find all of those exciting recipes in vegetarian versions. I may be being unfair if, as the author says, most Thai food has meat or at least fish in it. The author has taken a wonderful first step in finding innovative ways to omit ALL animal products. So really, I suppose, we just need more books like this and we have an area that needs much more vegetarian exploration."
5,Great cookbook,"This cookbook was a present to a vegetarian and she loves it! It is oftentimes semi difficult to find certain ingredients for a few of the recipes (Meaning you most likely will have to find an ethnic grocery store), but that was to be expected. Would recommend to any vegetarian looking to try out some new tastes."
1,pointless purchase,Take any thai cookbook. Remove all meat dishes. Then you have this book. It makes no effort to develop vegetarian Thai meals. A complete waste of time if you own even a single thai cookbook
2,Another one match card from XPW,"Being quite a big fan of XPW I was hopeing this would be a good DVD to own, I was wrong.Firstly the lighting is terrible, especially in the main event. Its like someone has turned the brightness down on the video camera, and whats worse is that you only have that camera angle or a birds eye view camera angle which is terrible to watch. The undercard for this event was pretty bad, with at least 5 missed spots(pre-planned moves) in every match! I recommend Baptized in Blood 2, or Go funk yourself or even redemption over this XPW event.The DVD comes with a few extras, a Major Gunns video clip, which is basically her at a photo shoot with a dance beat in the background and an extra match from redemption, Webb vs. Kaos.Good points*A few good falls in the main event*At least there are extras on this DVD!Bad points*Cameras*Sound*Some really awful matches*Alot more bad points I dont have time to writeDVD playing time: approx 2 hours (excluding extras)"
3,Light-weight and old-fashioned,"This ia a trite and light-weight novel, and it did not inspire me to download any of Ms Dunn's other books! At least it was a quick and easy read.."
3,Life Begins For Daisy,"This is the first book in the Daisy series. It is a good introduction to Daisy, whose character becomes more fully delineated as the book series continues. The Daisy murder mysteries are sweet, enjoyable reads where the real story is her relationship with Chief Inspector Fletcher, and her writing career with a murder or two thrown in to move the story along. I enjoy the look in the 1920's in England which the author does quite well."
4,"Good story, good history","This book, the second in the Daisy Dalrymple life, is a good second, no let down in characters, nor in setting. I enjoy Carola Dunn's work very much, and recommend her to any Christie fan."
3,It's aiight,"I use essential oils for washing my hair because I do the ""no shampoo"" thing which involves washing your hair with apple cider vinegar and baking soda. Washing my hair with essential oils ensures my hair smells nicer. I used peppermint oil before this and I liked the smell a lot better. I used the lemon as a air freshener as well (put it in spray bottle with witchhazel and water) and it just smelled okay. So many people commented that they love the lemon smell because it smells ""clean"" but it just makes me think of cleaning products rather ""nature."""
5,Lemony Smell!,We bought this to use in our air cleaner that uses water. The smell is lemony fresh and very natural. It's super nice and smells like fresh lemons. You won't regret it.
3,no dropper or anything,"I was surprised there was no dropper (any type for that matter) when I opened this. I have a diffuser and I tipped the bottle of this to slowly get it in there and it dribbled down the side and landed on my counter top instead of in the diffuser. I just had to adjust the position of the bottle in the air so it would dribble into the diffuser and not on the counter. It's a little disappointing, since I buy other Now Foods oils which have some sort of dropper. I just wish this one did. It would make things easier. Otherwise, great lemon smell and product!"
4,Great smell -- no dropper,"I had read other reviews about the fact that this oil doesn't come with a dropper -- but I forgot when I got it and I wasted quite a bit accidentally unfortunately, being used to essential oil bottles with a dropper top...but the oil smells great."
5,So many uses and very uplifting!,"Lemon oil has got to be my very favorite essential oil. I use it in my laundry, in the bath tub, in my diffuser, in cleaning solutions, the list goes on and on and on. I have a very limited budget so I must say that if I can only have one essential oil in my home this would definitely be it.This oil is good quality. It isn't the strongest I have smelled but it is, by far, the very best value. You do need a dropper with this bottle but you can fix that problem easily. They are carried here on Amazon and the plastic ones come in packs of several and they do just fine.I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I highly recommend it to all consumers."
1,You get what you pay for,Bought this due to the value pricing and size. Was so disappointed to find it smells rancid. Will not buy again.
5,Wonderful smell!,"I just got the product and used it in my burner. It smells so fresh and clean.I was a little concerned about how well it would work with my oil burner, but I didn't need to worry.I'm buying 2 more bottles."
5,Love lemon oil,There are so many uses for lemon oil. It gives soothing pain relief and has an uplifting fragrance. I put a drop or two on my microfiber dusting clothes. It will also remove most stains from clothing. Just put a drop or two on the stain and a little dish soap and gently rub the fabric together. Leave it a few hours and then wash as usual. Most stains come out.
2,Read if you plan on using this for reed diffusers!,"Firstly, this product is very good if you don't plan on using this for reed diffusers. It smells amazing as you would expect lemon oil to smell. It works very well if you plan on putting in a oil heater to fill your room for aromatherapy.However, this won't work with reed diffusers. I have used this oil with two different sets of reed sticks and with and without a reed oil base. All four combinations didn't work well. The oil just couldn't climb up the reed sticks so the smell doesn't get diffused into the room."
2,This is the best deal I found and it a very reputable brand.,"I don't know if it works well as a diffuse, the smell goes away quickly and it didn't seem to offer the cleansing properties that the nutritionists said it would."
2,"""The Secret"" All Over Again","Bull and fluff. This book was a huge disappointment considering it has been #1 on the New York Times Bestseller's list for a few weeks now.It really is about making wishes and dreams come true by telling the magical universe what you want. Sound familiar? That's right. It's a rehash of ""The Secret""."
2,Preschool art: Drawing not what I expected,I was hoping for something new but book is full of projects that can be easily found in other publications and on-line. Wish I hadn't purchased this book.
3,"Not a ""Translator""","Once and for all may the publishers stop calling Barks a translator. He is in his own right a fine poet but he has not translated Rumi from Persian or any other language.The latest book from Ibrahim Gamard, ""The Quatrains of Rumi"" gives a fine example of excellent translation and scholarship. Buy both Barks and Gamard and make your own decisions on this important matter."
3,A little hard for me,"I have tried to read this book few times but each time i put it down because i don't understand most of his poems. I am sure Rumi's work is awesome and as said by the other readers, it is one of the best translations available of his poetry but if someone can recommend me something that is easier than this one, i will appreciate that."
5,It's the Heart of the translation that counts,"This is by far my favorite Rumi book, and Barks is my favorite translator.Rumi is pointing at, living, something beyond words, something that resides deep in our hearts. For me, many of the poems in the book take me there. It is a huge blessing."
5,Rumi speaks with a powerful whisper...,"Written with exquisite simplicity this book speaks to a reality we only vaguely suspect and then goes deeper to excavate our deepest spiritual roots. Rumi speaks with a quiet roar. If you dare to listen, you will not remain unchanged."
3,"Translation, yes. Context, no.","This is a great, simple translation of Rumi's work to English. However reading it in English is like watching black & white television. I wish the author would take some time to explain a little context around each of these beautiful writings."
2,Not Very Comfortable...,"I ordered this chair based on price and the reviews. I have to say it is not very comfortable. First of all it is too tall. When I sit in it, my feet can't reach the floor. It is hard to get in and out of due to its height. Third, the swivel is loose, so that when you try to glide , it's swiveling too. Fourth, to call this a ""reclining"" chair, is really misleading. It does not recline very far back at all. Had I been able to try it out first, I would not have purchased this chair!"
3,FM Buyer,"Hello,this was a gift to a family member a teen was in mind.So when I got the shipment of this item was great very protected and packing was great ! It came with no damage and that is a plus. Ups delivery was great!The chair was much larger than we thought it would be ,however it is a was a very comfortable chair for all. The teen did not end up with this chair in there room due to size ,it works well in a living space .It was pretty easy to put together.The fabric is nice, The rocker is now squeaking a little nothing big,but the seat of it is already warn down from one person in the home sitting in it daily ,not all day but often.It just has very little bottom cushion so it will wear down fast if regular seating is what you want this for. The seat has lost its cushion in only a months time ,that is my only negative! how much does the one person weight who sat in it daily 140lbs .I still say this is a good chair -buy a cushion for it and bam back to best chair !"
1,THIS CAR SQUEEKS,I GOT THIS CAR FOR MY DAD AFTER LOOKING THRU MANY WEBSITES TO FIND A REPLACE CAR FOR HIM. A ROCKER RECLINER. HE BOUGHT ONE A YEAR AGO FROM BIG LOTS A LOCAL RETAIL STORE IN MY CITY BUT THE CHAIR WAS EITHER SOLD OUT IN THE BONE COLOR OR ON BACK STOCK. OF COURSE I TOLD HIM TO JUST ORDER OFF AMAZON AND HAVE ONE DELIVERED TO HIS ADDRESS. THE CAR CAME IN A BIG BOX AND THE BOTTOM PART WAS ALREADY ASSEMBELED JUST CLICK TOP PART INTO SLOTS AND COMPLETE. YES THIS WAS EASY ENOUGH BUT AFTER ROCKING IN THE CHAIR THE BOTTOM MEATL PARTS THAT HOLD THE CHAIR TOGETHER SQUEEKED WITH EVERY MOTION. HE HAS TRIED TO USE A BARRIER IN BETWEEN THE METALS PARTS BUT THAT DON'T WORK. HE GREASED IT AND STILL NOISEY. HE IS STILL USING IT BUT HE LIVES ALONE SO WHO'SE HE GONNA BOTHER. SO MY REVIEW IS IF YOUR LOOKING TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY IN YOUR HOME JUST BUY A CAR LIKE THIS ONE I'M SURE YOU'LL RUN THEM OFF. LOL SORRY FOR THE MIS SPELLED WORDS.
2,Not really...,"I do like Diedrich Bader and Chris Parnell, but not enough to ever sit through this film twice.Jokes aren't necessarily funny when they're repeated ad nauseam. Tyler Labine, a giant on Kabijje (ha ha, yes, sounds like 'cabbage') doesn't realise he's shrunk to normal human size when transported to earth, and spends a large chunk of screen time stomping around and threatening to crush people. Amusing? Yes. Amusing after five minutes? No.You really need to be in an uncritical frame of mind to appreciate this film - it won't hurt to be intoxicated, as well. Probably on Smirnoff Ice.This film would've made a good SNL skit."
2,Humor is an Alien Concept,"This movie was recommended to me as one of the funniest movies I will ever see in my life. Horrible acting & even worse script. After watching it the first time, I thought I should have watched it drunk. Would be much funnier. Wine colored Onesies. Tyler yelling all the time. A Tori Spelling look-a-like. Watching it drunk made it worse. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the Onesies. Maybe you need to be high to laugh at this. There's having a dry sense of humor & then none. Deidrich & Chris are funny guys when they have quality stuff to work with. Just wish they would have."
2,You can do better.,"Think of the worst SNL skit that you ever saw, stretch it to 90 minutes and you've got my opinion. Buy ""Monarch of the Moon"" for a LOT more laughs!"
1,ALASKA RIVER FISHING WITH FLY ROD,I found this very poor indead. Most of the video had no flyfishing in it and is very amatuerish. I wouldn't recommend it to my dog.
2,I'd give 2.5 if I could.,"LOL! this was the first guitar video I ever bought back in 1995, when I was trying to teach myself guitar. I take ""real"" lessons now and after playing this video recently, I'd have to say Joe Carr's teaching is somewhat unclear. You can't even see everything he's playing. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner whose just starting. I think I lost interest in guitar because of these lessons."
5,Works Great!,"I've spent the last couple years living in Mississippi and Louisiana, respectively, where cockroaches abound. I've had great results using this product indoors to control the number of bugs that enter my house, and it's a lot cheaper than hiring an exterminator. Still, if I spray it without a mask I get a cough that lasts for a few minutes afterwards, even though there are no visible particles of it in the air (I don't believe it tells you to use a mask, unless they changed the label since the last time I bought it). I'm not saying you shouldn't buy it, and I understand that I AM reviewing poison, but you might want to weigh the severity of your bug problem against your willingness to expose yourself to cheap nerve toxin. Or you could just wear a mask. Anyway, It seems to work well. Go ahead and order it."
1,If only...,"It might have been an interesting video, I don't know because my player said: ""this video can't be seen here"". So it was an ""1"" marked video. Like it was on amazon.co.uk.....Guy Mock"
1,Didn't Like It,"In this book the main characters were Sam, Davy, and Jackie. It was basically about that Jackie bacame a Brooklyn Dodger and became one of the world's greatest baseball player. Then this boy really became a fan of his. Jackie became really ill and sick ,and hit a home run for his best friend Sam. Jackie said ""baseball will never be over"". I will never ever recommend this book to a adult. If I ever did I would recommend this book to a child or a sportman. I think this book was the most boriest book I ever read. This book was held at Brooklyn Stadium and other places around Brooklyn."
2,The downcline of ICP!!,"Before you go getting in my face with my review, I have been a juggalo since I first heard their album ""The Great Milenko."" I no longer call myself a Juggalo however because most of the ""new age"" Juggalos have no clue what a real Juggalo is and give us a bad name. Now as for my review of this CD. I know ICP's true sound, and this sure is not their true sound. They have started their unfortunate downcline here, as if they're trying to get softer on us. I do like a few songs, but I can't say I love ICP anymore, I simply like their older stuff. I don't love any songs off of here but I do enjoy a few if I hear them. Sorry Juggs and ICP, but this record isn't doing anything for me!!"
3,"It's weak to a degree, however, it's a nice end","Well, this is where Bizzar/Bizaar left off on the non-carnival sounds, more of the hardcore/electronic rap that became what ICP wanted to be: mainstream. They were still violent, but this starts with more soft sounds, more violence, and finally just implodes. However it's got some good tracks."
2,........,"when this cd first leaked, i downloaded and listened to it non stop, i still bought it after it came out but after awhile it just got old. i dont like the change between joker cards, ""The Amazing Jeckl Brothers"" was great, ""The Great Milenko"" is phat as hell, but ""The Wraith: Shangri-la"" isnt as good as it should of been"
1,My jaw dropped...,"ICP found God in between Jeckle brothers and the Wraith, so they decided that they only way they could put out the last joker's card without sinning would be to make the God album. They lost Mike Clark, twisted the meanings of their previous songs, and tried to pretend that they were the same people that they used to be.This album is not worth listening to. A real ICP fan might want to cry. I was so dissapointed that I gave the CD away.What a cop out. How can ICP create such a huge following, encouraging them to become juggalos and get tattoos, and then betray them by turning their backs on everything that they ever stood for.Unless you want to hear ICP try to convince you that all the old music was just a big trick and they real message is holyness (and set to very, very ...heavenly music), avoid this like the plague..."
1,No Mike E. Clark = No Good,"Easily their worst album to date. It was no secret before this record that Mike E. Clark was the real talent of ICP, and it is just proven with this cd, which Clark didn't produce.Music was lame, the lyrics were not funny and uninspired and not 'wicked' at all. I find it hard to even listen to all my previous ICP cds now, The Wraith just killed it for me. What a bunch of phonies."
1,it stinks!,"this album was a major disappointment, its pretty bad, only a comple of songs are even listenable, i dont know what happend here, but this album is a total abortion, maybe too much time off between albums or something, just seems like they were not even trying.just makes me all the more the eminem fan, he never disappoints his fans, unlike these has-beens"
2,What a horrible dissapointment.,"I know that many of you juggalo's might be a bit upset with me after reading this, but this album was nothing more than a top-notch disappointment. After listening to this CD, countless number of times, I realized, it sounds NOTHING like any of the previous joker's cards. I've been down with the clown for close to 7 years, and this album was supposed to be Shangri-La, the summation of everything else. Instead I'm sitting here, in front of my computer, shaking my head, wondering, what in the world went wrong here. If you're a juggalo and a fan of any of the previous joker's cards your in for a huge disappointment with The Wraith."
1,Its not the same,"The old Icp like Riddle Box, Great Milenko, and Ring master Would be the best ICP you could get This CD isnt the same as the old ones are i dont even find this cd funny like their other ones they dont have those old great beats and they dont sound like they used to so just simply DONT GET THIS IT SUCKS"
5,ICP for life REal Juggalos will love this sh**,"okay this JOKER's card rocks it doesn't get better than this i love murderrap, aint yo bizz,cottoncandy, hell i love the WHOLE cd. but as far as the unveiling goes, people think jay and shaggy are tellin you to be religious and join a church but all i think they are sayin is that there is a god and no matter what you believe in like jeuse or budda or what ever, that he's up there, it's up to you to decide what to call him and how to belive in him"
1,What the hell?....,"Why...what? wasnt this suppost to be a joker card?... where is the dark carnival stuff? where are ICP...? all was smooth and perfect so far... now... dead... and what are these other rappers poppin up?! these are no wicked clowns(...)... what a sad end... i can only hope, and REALLY HOPE that this was just one bad album, and they recover from it... so far ill still do my riddlebox tattoo none the less... damn, this album screws the collection :/Comercial... not ICP... singing pop... VJs voice SUCKSSSssDont fear fans, they may make up for it!(fingers crossed and the wraith CD tossed)Paul Falzon"
1,Falling Off,"I have been a fan of ICP since Great Milenko...and i also bought riddle Box after hearing Milenko, and I have come up with the conclusion that ICP is falling off. Thay have slowly gotten worse and worse after milenko. Their new cd ""the Wraith"" is repetitive in concepts and also not funny (which is why i liked ICP to begin with). The songs are very slow and very poorly rapped. People that want to hear ""the real ICP"" should purchase Milenko, jeckyl brothers, or riddle box...these are ICP at their prime."
3,Hrm...,"This cd is up for debate. I've been into ICP since The Carnival Of Carnage and even though I'm only giving it 3 stars, I think it's the best. When I heard the first track, I expected the majority of the album to be the same - it's not. Some people have stated that it's mainly violent and immature, but that's how they write, if you don't like it, don't listen to it. The highlights on the album are definitely To The Light, Homies, Crossing The Bridge, and The Unveiling. I'd say buy it if you're a fan, but if you're just getting into ICP, listen to a friend's copy before rushing out and buying it."
5,16 year old ninja,"this cd is the shiznit, as are all of the other albums j and shaggy have put out. buy all of their stuff and see why they have lasted so long and why their fans are so defendable of them. they have built a carnival of psycho soldiers known as juggalos, and juggalettes. i am looking forward to j's wizard of the hood coming out tomorrow july 22nd. one more thing, props to jamie and paul to making the green book fresh as heck, excuse my non profanitive speaking. well peace ninjas hope this review helps, MMFCL."
3,"Good cd, but outcome not predictable","I think that after this cd, i came to the realization that the dark carnival is fake. After the unveiling, i was shocked and very disaapointed. TO all the juggalos out there, it's okay to not like this album very much. I was let down by it, mostly because it's not that good and is just stupid why they didn't spend more time on the 6th and final joker's card. An embarrasement to the dark carnival and everything before this cd is a masterpiece compared to this piece of junk."
4,Not Dissapointing,"Well, it may not be the jokers card with the best beats, to me at least, but i still loved it. I espiecially like the way it ended ""were not sorry if we tricked you, we dont care what happens now.""well when i said i was down with the clowns for life, thats exactly what i meant. and i dont have no burnt version either, i bought the real thing on nov 5.Overall, id say this cd is worth buying if you already have the first 5 J.C.s, why not. im not sure if its true, but i think a second the wraith cd is spposed to come out, 'hells pit' or something or other.well, thats my review, peace juggalos.klown4lyfemmfcl"
2,bring back mike e. clark,"this cd is good and it looks like they're going in a new direction, but in my opinion it's nowhere near as good as the mike e. clark produced albums."
5,"The End Of One Era, And The Beginning Of Another","The Six Joker Cards Are About Shangri-La And The Crumbling Of Time, And The Dark Carnival Represents Heaven. So If The Joker Cards were Heaven (or Shangri-la) As Told On The Unveiling. A New Era Must Begin as We Know From The Line On ""Welcome To The Show"": ""But If You Really Want To hear The Devils Exhibit The Sh*t Is Called Hell's Pit Run Out And Get It"" And If You Read The Lyrics On Hell's Forcast You Know That The Next Era Is ""Hells Pit"" Which Is Supposedly Going to be there darkest album to date. This is pure Genious On I.C.P.'s Part. If You Listen Close To Some of The Songs And Block out the Juggalos, Faygo, And Clowns (But why would you want to) Its All The secrets are there."
2,Clowns change gears,"The ICP web site says two free DVDs are available, designated by different stickers. I don't know which is being included here. My locally purchased CD came with the concert DVD. Footage suffers from being out of focus, poor lighting, camera shake, tripod shake, bad two track audio. Is obvious why they had to give it away. No features or menus usually available on DVDs. While the audio is poor it is sufficient to expose the very poor live musical quality of the concert.If you own all other ICP discs, sure buy this one too. Otherwise this should be your last choice. Amazing Jeckle Brothers, Great Milenko, and Tunnel of Love are much better values than this CD. I like other ICP music, but this CD was a huge let down."
5,WoaH,"HOLY ...[SMOKES]! great cd, It could possibly be one of the best cd's i have heard in my young life. ICP has once again amazed me with a huge turn around and keepin the wicked beatz goin. This cd will truely show you who the REAL Juggalos are. This is different than the rest of the icp ...[stuff] out there. They go with the wicked ...[stuff] AND they throw in some new ways of flowin their message (and even reveal it)..I've been down since i heard the first cd..This cd makes me have even MORE MCL.. Icp tells it how it is..if you like the old cd's but hate these new tracks GET OFF THE ""RIDE"" For the rest of you out there who were totally moved by the wickedness of this CD I Give You Mad Clown Luv...Untill I See You In Shangri-La,Kroptonik"

3,"""Truth is we follow God/we've always been behind him....""","That is a line taken straight from the last song on the Wraith titled THY UNVELLING, some juggalos might of found it a huge suprise, but others, like me, saw it already. How could u not? Inside every one of the six joker cards is a thank you section, and at the top of every thank you section is a thank you to the lord above.

3,Educational large map,"The map arrived in a timely manner, was fairly large and printed clearly, pretty much as the picture shown on the website. It's a good reference map for cities and countries."
4,AN ANIME ST AT ITS BEST,"AS AN OWNER OF MANY SOUNDTRACKS, I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ST. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE SONGS ""DOGFIGHT"" AND ""BLAZIN BEAT"" AREN'T LONGER."
4,Excellent non-standard performance helper!,"As an combo Oracle DBA, database designer and PL/SQL developer I have found this book to be especially valuable over many others in the area of performance tuning. It's clear and not cluttered up like official Oracle documentation, yet mines out some real jewels from a deeper than usual understanding of the Oracle engine. It's not comprehensive or systematic; the author tends to jump around covering the areas of his own expertise. This actually makes the book MORE useful. Excellent treatment of partitioning.This is not another book that simply regurgitates Oracle documentation!"
4,"Good, detailed book","I'm a data architect at a small tech company, now working mostly with data warehouses, and was looking to refresh my data modeling skills. After reading Amazon reviews about different modeling books I chose this one and have not been disappointed. Rather than reading it from front to back, I read the first couple hundred pages and am now skipping around and reading sections that interest me.The book is logically put together, and has a very detailed contents index, which makes finding relevant information easy. The sections I have read not only explain the theory but also give good examples putting the theory into practice. However, they sometimes seem to place too much emphasis on a theoretical approach that would never be used in the real world.Overall I find this book very useful and have marked it up with sticky notes for sections I'll revisit for my next database modeling design."
3,blueprint overall coverage and scattered ideas,"Found this among the hundred of books on database modeling in the stacks of a large university library, this one caught my eye for being a recently pubblished book. For comparison with the other books, looked for a couple of specific problems I recently experienced while designing databases. While not the best book in terms of illustrations, probably due to space considerations, this book does give an overall coverage to many different topics. It kind of provides a blue print and smashboard collection of ideas, but it is the up to the reader to actually individually research and try out the concepts and fine tune into developing a specific implementation. So I give credit to this attempt in laying out ideas, but less credit for actually providing real-life implementations. Can't do everything, I guess."
2,Poorly written,"While this book contains useful concepts, the author keeps getting ahead of himself. Every few pages an advanced concept is introduced with the phrase ""chapter 6 will cover this in detail, but for now"". What follows is a sketchy summary of an advanced concept requiring a full chapter. This is a hopelessly confusing way of organizing material. I either have to jump ahead to chapter 6 to figure out what in the heck the author is talking about and hope I could understand that chapter without reading previous ones (I couldn't), or simply skip it for now and hope it wasn't important (it was). I tried both, and neither method worked.I keep asking myself why other reviewers praise this work. Why does every computer book written in the past couple years have at least 4 1/2 stars? Publishers hire professional reviewers to write glowing reviews. Don't fall for them, or for this book!"
1,Cannot tolerate MSG!,"I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer."
5,The best AP Calc prep you can get!,"Princeton's famous for great AP Prep (in most cases, anyways), and they certainly executed the AP Calc book well! The review is concise but thorough, and every subject is basically covered. Very impressed by the examples and tests provided in this book. Certainly the best choice!"
4,It is an average book,"The actual free responses on AP exam were very hard. This book has very easy multiple choice section and free response section. Try not to depend too much on this book for practice tests. However, it does sharpen your knowledge about all the concepts, which are very important to know for the exam. I did manage to get a 4 in 2002. The free response section was the killer."
5,Music Fan - Sexy and funky jazz w/ beautiful piano,"This CD & the other albums from Soul Ballet are a unique mix of sexy and rythmic jazz, pop, & in a few songs there is a beautiful mixture of piano making the music very soothing and relaxing. The music from Soul Ballet is filled with unique and rythmic tunes and are truly classified as jazz masterpieces. I wish Ballet had more to choose from. This music is a must have. When are they ganna produce a new album? I hope very soon."
5,Hip and Smooth!!,"This cd's got tunes that's hip to the groove. RK's first effort is a successful one, giving us a taste of what the next generation of smooth jazz is. I love the tracks ""Love, Juliet"" and ""Walking through the Rain"", but the tune ""When She Moves"" is his signature track. Get ready to shake your behind off."
1,Causes Probelms for Your Camera,"Oh sweet, batteries that are way cheaper than the real thing. WRONG. They aren't the real thing or equivalent as stated. The real battery is 3.7V and this is 3.6V. I didn't think it would make a difference but I continually have problems with my camera when using the Power2000 battery. It shuts off at random, turns off without pulling the lens back in, sometimes won't turn on at all until the battery is removed and then put right back in, and displays chaotic battery power levels such as being low and then all of the sudden full. When the actual Pentax battery is used there are absolutely no problems. Hopefully it hasn't damaged the camera itself."
4,Kegal Exercise,This is somewhat uncomfortable to walking around with. Maybe would work best if in bed all day long but not for the very active person. A little on the costly side as well but may work.
5,FONKAY !!!,"In my opinion, the most underrated Funk album in history. The grooves are tight and funky! It was released at a time when the industry was sample crazy and gangster rap ruled. It was released way before its time. Tunes are so funky you can't help but to nod your head and make the ugly face!"
1,Deep disappointment,"I am a fan of the National Geographic series, but the poor quality of this relatively new issue was a deep disappointment. Rather than tracing the flaws in design, production, or emergency procedures through the evolution of the submarine (as I had expected), the documentary spent a huge amount of footage on filler, including a lengthy bit of fluff about the fun-loving antics of a current submarine crew. The facts that led to the demise or near-demise of each submarine were glossed over, while the camera dwelt at great length on the anguish of a few of the survivors. The incidents were presented nearly free of scientific content or historic context."
1,Didn't work,"Received the item fast. Unfortunately it didn't work. We went to the Mfg website and looked at all the help files, followed all of their recommended procedures, and test procedures and nothing helped, it's just dead. My husband has a background in electrical, so he knows what he's doing. Returning it and ordering a different brand of controller. Hope that one works!SunGuard SG-4 4.5 amp 12 volt Solar Charge Controller Regulator by MorningstarReturned the defective controller 2 months ago and am STILL waiting for my refund! Won't buy from this seller ever again. Just filed a claim with Amazon, maybe they can get me my money back."
1,Does not work!,"The item arrived quickly and packaged well. Unfortunately, the controller did not work. I applied the output of 2 X 15 watt solar panels (30 watts). Input voltage was well within range as was amps. However, there was no output from the controller. I read in other reviews that there had to be a load to see that the controller was working, so I connected the output to my battery that was slightly discharged. After 2 very sunny days of solar output with proper voltage measured to the input of the controller, there was no change to the charge on the battery. I'm sending it back and looking for something else."
2,You have got to be kidding?,"I read this book on the ""advice"" from a friend. I thought this was supposed to be Finding Henry? It is more like missing Chris, hating Jon, missing/hating Mark and finding Henry. I think Rebecca is a bit over zealous when it comes to finding love. And, on a side note, none of these relationships worked because every time she was dating one, she was fawning over another! This book shows a writer that is both immature in life and expirience. A traveler does not a grown up make. Over all, this book did have a couple of interesting thing, the bones and...well ok, one. A general waste of a poor tree."
3,Beautiful Photograpy,"While I felt that the pictures in this book were amazing, I felt it was lacking in many other areas. I agree that this was a ""coming of age"" story and it was supposed to show the changes that she made in herself, but I didn't see any. When she asks herself if she has become that shallow or if she is being a b**** , that should have been a moment of growth. It didn't seem so. It was however mildly entertaining to follow her story and, as I said the pictures are very nice....I think she missed her calling."
3,shoot the photographer,"The technique in this video is clear and sound. However, the photographer seems to think that the video is really about his/her own creative approach. As a result, the viewer is often denied the basic requirement of seeing the dancer's body in motion, and instead gets to see only one elbow, or a hand and the wall. It's maddening. How did they let this happen?"
3,Old Basics,"As a dancer, I found this video to be extremely basic. I am glad to own it, since it is a useful addition to my primarty movement styles of ballet and modern dance. Since it was filmed in the early 1980's, it is an interesting look at the more recent history of Jazz dance, but it is definately dated material! Other reviewers are correct when they say it was filmed artistically, and I believe that seeing only shadows and isolated body parts would make it difficult for a beginner to continue following the movements. However, the movements are usually repetitions of the same phrase, so that consideration should not be a great hinderance once you have viewed the video a few times, or are more familiar with the movement style."
2,Not an exercise video per se,"I thought that this would be an aerobic exercise video using jazz dance elements. It really is a class and is very slow and emphasizes form, which is great if you want to be a jazz dancer. My goal was to add variety to my in-home workout and this does not meet that goal."
1,It went in the trash.,"Poorly written and if you go to the site and listen to these recording, you'll hear garbled sounds. Weird, yes, but her daughter? I doubt it.I was looking for books on electronic voice phenomenon and found Sarah Estep's material much more helpful.This is an honest opinion, and people should know that the information given in Copeland's book is simply a repeat of other, better authors with actual recordings of evp you can hear.Most of the reviewers who gave 5 stars are biased as they are friends of Copeland."
2,Love these folks But Too Much Discord,"I love Native American music - especially woodwinds. Nakai is one of my favorites. However, ""People of Peace"" does not measure up to my favorite cloud riding and early morning appreciation of wildlife and sunrises - far too much discord. This is not relaxing. This makes me want to go on the warpath instead of loving my fellow man.I tried to write them after I bought it, but couldn't find an address or e-mail. If someone could relay this: ""Carlos, please, give us what you do best - wind and rain - not hard jazz.""Dr Dram Buie"
5,Customer evaluation,"Response from the supplier was excellent, service was excellent. Great place to do business with. Deserves the highest of rating.Disc 1. Introduction to the Elliott Wave Principle"
2,Fast shipping but only 3 screw hole line up.,"The package shipped in like a third of the time they said it would.the reason i gave them 2 stars is because i like the look of this, but like i say only 3 screw hole line up. I hope that it holds in place. I just wish that all 4 holes line up. If it would have had all star if the screw holes would have lined up."
1,Wrong item,"I purchased the replacement buld by the makers description. It was the wrong item and now I'm waiting 2 or 3 weeks to return it cause I have to have a return label. And they said I couldn't return it if it is opened. Well, how do I know if it fit without opening it??? I still have not received the return label. Very unhappy!"
2,Narrower than advertised,"The internal width of the cover is 5 and 3/8 inches. This is about an inch narrower than most modern thermostats. At the same time, the depth is 2 and 3/4 inch. This is probably an inch deeper than required or desired. The internal height is a little more than 4 and 1/2 inches. It does have ventilation slots all the way around, so it should work well for those thermostats it fits."
4,Mommy Dearest & Jason is your Dad...WOW.,"THE AFFLICTED, A Mother's Love Has It's LimitsStarring : Leslie Easterbrook and Kane Hodder.Pretty amazing film about a dysfunctional family to an extreme of violent proportions.The mother,Leslie Easterbrook, Is cruelly perfect in this role : Shades of `Mommy Dearest & Jason's mom from Friday The 13th'.Kane Hodder has a wild role as the HELPLESS ? father/husband who is catalyst to plot.This film has such intense scary moments, It could be Brain Damage biggest release to date.This critic felt that the child characters could have changed their demise and yet When the brother did what he did,Oh We get it now...."
3,Scary that this is based on a true story.,"The acting was great. I ended up despising the characters I was supposed to. It was a ROUGH movie to watch. Very very disturbing. If this were not based on a true story, I think I might have liked it but it was too much to handle for me."
2,Disgusting,"I have watched many movies based on true life events, but NOTHING would ever make me watch this again. I just don't understand how HOW these older teenage kids let this occur. And yes I have firsthand knowledge of how scary living with a mentally ill person can be, and with that said it just angers me beyond belief how help did not get there in time and the opportunities were numerous. Heart goes out to the children."
1,movie sucked,movie sucked very bad. my brother was one of the actors cody allen. was not impressed with it at all.
1,C Grade horror movie!,"C Grade horror movie! In hindsight would not have watched it, there is a reason I couldn't find a review on rotten tomatoes."
1,Just awful,Poorly made and poorly acted movie with a terrible script. I could go on and on but will not. This movie was made available for an inexpensive price but was still a rip-off. If it was free it would have merely been a waste of time but Amazon charged real money for a faux movie.I cannot and will not recommend this movie to anyone. Just open your windows and listen to your neighbors argue. Cheaper and at least as entertaining....and free.
2,Disappointing,This could have been a good movie but just focused on the beating. No real connecting of characters with the audience.
4,Good movie,"This movie was eerie and disturbing, especially knowing that it is based on a true story. I am shocked that there really are deranged people like that!"
3,It's OK,This is very very loosely based on a true story of a mother's abuse of her four children. The abuse scenes are graphic. The mother forcing her daughters into prostitution made me want to vomit and I wouldn't recommend for anyone under 17. There are some added characters for dramatic affect and having read the true account I'm not sure how anyone can afflict this much abuse and not get caught until after two of her four are dead.
4,You'd have to know the details of the Knorr case...,"... to understand why I'd give this four stars. A lot of the events that happen in this film really did happen. I don't want to give spoilers, so do a search on 'Theresa Knorr', read up a little and then watch this film to get the most enjoyment. Some of the things that happen are blown up in the film for the sake of theatrics, but enough of it actually happened to make one cringe."
4,The Afflicted,"Leslie Easterbrook the actress, who plays the Mother does a great job and is so convensing as an alcoholic schizophrenic. This movie is dark, violent and disturbing. The plot is very simple. I also thought the actresses, who played her daughters also did an outstanding job. This movie is not for everyone but for some, worth a look."
3,Sick and Twisted,It took me awhile to remember but I saw a documentary about this years ago. it was either on Cold Case Files or American Justice on A & E. This is actually a pretty good movie. The only sad part about it is that it's true. These events did happen.
5,Beautiful and Classic,PROS:- Beautiful and classic designCONS:- Slightly thin... I definitely would not think to abuse these glasses with conditions in the freezer or the dishwasher the way that I would a regular set of Libbey margarita glassesCONCLUSION:Definitely the perfect set of margarita glasses for formal parties.
5,T power of power,"What more can you say? T power is the pioneer, the standard setter, the man, T power is the man. Waveform is a WAY psycho trip into the world of organic jungle and blotter nonsense."
5,"The cdrom Video of ""I Believe"" is beautiful !! Great !!","I also fell in love with Boyzone, especially Stephen Gately viewing the Lloyd Webber Celebration performance on T.V. Since then, I have managed to collect quite a few of the earlier and current products, both CDs and VHS taped performances ! This Irish group stands up to any we have in America of the boy bands, and in my opinion, surpass them! I only wish that this group, and especially cute, talented little Stephen Gately would go Big Time over here. This single is sooo good, especially that included video !! So neat to see him up close and singing in his beautiful tenor voice !!! I am just trying to collect any of his singles with those delightful videos on the singles! I am a grown woman, but lost in great singing voices and good presentation ! A ""must have"" for good music fans !!"
4,it's exclusive for me cause.....,"this single means alot to me cause a person from UK got it just for me! so i hav it ""imported"" cause it's hard, i'm saying, very hard to get it in Malaysia! well, one thing, ""i believe"" was not really my fav but after watching the MTV, it's great to see steo perform with a full energy! 2 extra tracks, ""waiting for this feeling"" and ""where did you go"", were just nice to have them in the single, especially the one which was recorded at the Boyzone live concert! well, i just have to say that this is better than the ""new beginning"" single, as for me! i would have rated it 5 stars if this one is my fav of his album, but for steo fans, just get it! the cover is very nice! hav fun!"
2,Where is the story?,"I am another that doesn't understand all the praise for this book. I would agree that Robert Stone has writing ability. My problem is with the story. Telling about a bunch of stuff that happened is different than telling a story. One of the reviews referred to ""rebellion and redemption"". What redemption??? It would have been much better if there had been any redemption included in the novel. I will summarize this book so you don't have to waste your time. -- A bunch of disillusioned people get involved in a rebellion. Some die, some don't."
1,"Good event, terrible version.","If this was the whole event it would be 4 stars but this is just a hacked up 1 hour video with only 4 matches, and 1 of those matches doesn't even have a finish, it just cuts to the next match. Basically your missing out on 6 death matches and a few more undercard matches. The videos ""king of the deathmatch"" yet they only show 1 out of 7 death matches. Whats worse is that this hacked up piece of garbage costs the same as other 3 hour XPW events. The only good Baptized in Blood video is the second one. This one is obviously too short and the first one is just garbage. Try to pick up the full 3 hour version of this tape and you'll love it, if your in to death match style wrestling. But stay away from this version, and any other edited 1 hour XPW videos!"
2,Very Disappointing,"This book provides almost no information about designing VFCs despite its title. Rather it is a collection of manufacturers data sheets and application notes about how to use a limited range of prepackaged VFC/FVC chips.Even Chapter 6 which was billed as describing ""a number of discrete-component VFC and FVC circuit approaches"" is only a rehash of circuits from the National Semiconductor linear handbook based round their IC implementations.I could not recommend this book to anybody. If you have had little or no exposure to use VFC/FVCs circuits then I would recommend reading the Analog Devices etc. data sheets and design guides rather than wasting money on this book."
4,Buddy rich,this is one of the better dvds of buddy rich. It has the music plus a lot of background information
3,Creature colouring.,"This is an adult or at least an older child's colouring book. It is advertised for 6 years and up, but I seriously doubt if a 6 years old or any child under 10 would not get frustrated with this. Some of the designs have to be looked at carefully to get the correct colouring spaces done for the spiders, grasshoppers, etc.There are 23 pictures, 24 if you include the smaller one on the title page, which is less than half the size of the others. Twelve are the same, they are repeated twice. They are one sided and the pages are thick enough that most markers will not bleed throughThis is a nice exercise for those who enjoy more of a challenge in colouring, but certainly not for the very young. You do have to look at the price and see if it is worth the cost for the number of pictures."
3,Two amazing songs! Worth buying just for that.,"In the early days of mp3|com, I heard a couple songs that I thought were amazing, but never did find out the names of the songs or the artist. Ever since then, I've been hunting for the obvious names of the songs, but could never find them. Then, in 2012 I tried yet another Gooogle search and got lucky somehow, finding both ""Grey Matter"" and ""When You're Screaming"" on the same album on some site. I figured that ""Angel of the Odd"" must be the right artist, so I searched for them on Amazon and found the CD! Now I finally have a higher quality version of those songs!After listening to the whole album, I just couldn't get into it, but those two songs make it worth it."
1,Which Angel of The Odd?,"This is the third group to use the name ""Angel Of The Odd"". One is from Los Angeles, one is from Florida, this group is from East/North. The Los Angeles group formed in the early 80's. Psychedelic, post punk group. Performed with Speciman, Jane's Addiction, some others. The second group was early 90's and it was more of folksy/Rock. This group is late 90's and more Odd-Pop than anything. I recommend you buy this record if you know that they are the group you want to listen to. Otherwise, Angel of The Odd lies only on vinyl...."
3,"Good 7"" tablet bag","I bought this for travel with my 7"" tablet. The dimension s are given as 12x6x5 which would have accommodated my keyboard also. Unfortunately the actual dimension is 9.5x6x3. Still works with my mini keyboard but disappointing that it won't hold the larger one."
5,Great bag for travelling...,"I purchased this bag for my travels. It's the perfect size for a passport, wallet, airline tickets, a small book, and a few other odds and ends. It's an attractive bag, it's good quality, and is attractive. The item shipped quickly and I would purchase from this seller again."
4,Nnice man bag,a little too long but otherwise a very useful item for someone like me with health issues. allows me to put everything I need close at hand without bulking out my pants and jackets
4,"Good Concept, Good Characters, Good Book","What an interesting concept. Magic is created by demons, control the demons and you can perform powerful magic. If you get really good at it, you might even be able to take over the world.The demons in this book don't seem to necessarily be good or evil, but they do tend to demand a lot from their handlers. You have to learn how to use them and then you have to treat them right. No wonder most people don't bother with them. But if you were up against them in a battle you'd be at a definite diadvantage.The characters are just as interesting as the concept. Haft and Spinner are well defined and stay true to themselves as they develope. Once you get to know them you enjoy their different takes on the situation. The other characters they collect through their journey to safety are also well defined and fun.I'm looking forward to how they will all interact in the next book."
4,Good book,"I like the interaction between Spinner, Haft, Fletcher and Silent. The actions of the Golden Girl however are rather annoying, though somewhat understandable. Though I would find it hilarious if in coming books, someone takes her down a peg or two. Interesting names. Also a very interesting concept to write about."
1,What's the point???,This novel is totally off base. It's like reading two-thirds of the novel with the last third missing. I know that David Sherman is developing the series but he's trying too hard to develop the world concepts and history in one book. It's almost like a pre-book in which it prepares the reader for the rest of the series. He's trying to grasp the magical elements and mixing to the military tradition but he's not doing a very good job. He should stick to the Starfist novels and concepts.
1,Adobe software and cultural imperoialism,"I have been asked to review this product. Unfortunately this is imposible because export of this item to other countries is prohibited. While this is perfectly legitimate, it is not acceptable that these products are at the same time protected by international copyright preventing rediscovery of the contents by our own researchers. The way copyright is being used in this instance is not to further legitimate American prosperity, but rather to keep other countires down - an example of oppression by intellectual imperialism which is not tolerable. Please remember the rights of other nations."
3,HUGE TEXT,"This book is ideal for anyone suffering from severe poor eyesight. I returned this because the text is just too large for anyone with average eyesight. Every prayer is separated across 2, 3 and 4 pages because the text is so large. I wish the font was closer to 9 or 10 pt instead of 12 or 14."
5,One of the best prayer books,"I love this prayer book, it teaches you from basic prayers to more specialized ones and it also gives you a section on the process of Mass and all that good stuff. I've been looking for a book like this and the price isn't bad."
4,"excellent material, but slightly redundant","Having resently discovered that my birth mother's family was Catholic, I was interested in learning more about the faith of my forefathers. This book has excellent material although the format is slightly redundent in that each chapter repeats itself from the summary section to the detailed sections. Even with this quirky format, the information is very good and written in a style that is easy to read and understand. The more I read the more I am drawn closer to the faith of my forefathers."
5,Catholic Book of Prayers,This is an excellent work. It refreshes my memory to the prayers that I saidduring my formative years. The section about the Catholic faith is a primerfor anyone converting to the faith and a renewal for those who have takentheir faith for granted. I recommend this book for personal devotion or as agift to someone close you care about. RB
3,It rocks but don't take it seriously,I must have bought this album about six or seven years ago. If I remember correctly the tape I bought cost a dollar or two. The tape I have only has the first seven tracks on it. Every song is hard and the songs have a kind camp quality that some horror movies have. All the songs rock and the album all and all is fun to listen to. I recommend it for fans of 80's heavy metal.
5,This album rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the many metal albums of the 80's to fall into obscurity due to lack of notoriety. Nevertheless, it is totally hard, at times super fast and all around HEAVY. If you've never heard of Piledriver, rest assured you won't be disappointed. I bought this on vinyl in one of many trips through the import section of my local music shop, (which is where almost all true 80's metal was to be found) and I was blown away. Or should I say I was the victim of a Metal Inquisition. Get this one, now!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time on this garbage, I didn't remotely learn anything from this DVD. There's some clips of the ambassador's to Japan, Pakistan & Guatemala, and it says that people go to the embassy to get a VISA to get into the US. Basic, basic information. No one should waste thier time with this garbage. It wasn't worth a second of my time, yet alone an hour of my time. Save yourself, and don't see this."
5,National Geographic always the best!!,"Everything that comes from NG always be an excelent work!! It's good to have any of those DVD`s , where you always learn something.Thanks."
3,4 BORING FILMS THE KIDS MIGHT LIKE,"If you like made for TV science fiction, heavy on the fiction, type movies, then here is your 4 pack. I found the movies rather boring and I knew I would find them boring too, but the temptation of a discount 4 pack was too much for me. So I said, ""What the heck?"" It was only $5.00, so what could I lose other than $5.00 and 6 hours of my life?The movies aren't complete busts, and are only mildly entertaining. They are a step above Asylum movies, but not a large step.Now if I was about 10 years old and couldn't get enough sci-fi, such a gift, especially on blue-ray and for less than a dollar (plus shipping) might be worth while. I don't recall much in the way of adult action and words.If you liked the horrendous ""Ice Age 2012"" because you thought it was a good flick,you will love this 4 pack."
1,Complete waste of time,"Cutsey private investigator introduces a myriad of characters that never relate to the chase towards a solution to the mystery--and what's the main mystery?--""Where's my mother?"", which never gets solved in the whole dull reading. The author attempts to ompress you with details of the streets of Paris, which, also, muddles the tale. This was my first test of Cara Black --also my last. No thanks."
2,My Third And Last of the series,"Having enjoyed Cara Black's debut novel, I proceeded to read the next two. Having read the third one, I can say with certainty that it will also be the last. What starts off as charming and interesting very quickly turns formulaic. It's as though the author has a specific plot outline that she follows for each book, and while her detailed depiction of Paris remains interesting/unique, everything else is the same old, same old. Each book begins with an unexpected event unrelated to the protagonist's real line of business, and against her best judgment, she takes on the challenge. This leads to twists and turns, with the 'regular' recurring characters hovering in the background, and then ends with a heavy-handed and unrealistic action scene where the protagonist emerges, injured but alive. Key protagonist Aimee's character remains undeveloped, as well as those around her. Too bad, it was off to a good start."
4,Romance On The Blue Nile,"This book read more like a grade school culture capsule than a 500 mile wild river adventure that had never been accomplished before. However it did provide some insight into the Ethiopian culture and some good words to try out on my Ethiopian friends. Virginia Morell came across to me as a bit of a middle aged Drama Queen who was just absolutely overflowing with prattle and contrivance. It seemed to me that Morell rather fancied Captain Speaks and was frustrated that he was a real professional boatman and summarily ignored her attempted manipulations. There was no ""Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" on this trip for Virginia. The book tells an even better story about the Author than the Blue Nile."
4,Good Stuff!,"In the age of huge, impersonal corporations, it's great to see that businesses can actually thrive by giving something back to the communities they serve. I can't think of a better way to build a brand, and loyalty for that brand, than through Cause Related Marketing.This is must reading for anyone who runs a business!"
5,Awesome prayer tool on behalf of Israel!!,If you have a heart for Israel and her people you will certainly want this in your prayer tools. James Goll gives the scriptural foundation for prayers he suggests as models we can use to effectivly pray for Israel. Highly recommend it!
4,Excellent prayer guide for Christians,I believe that all Christians are called to pray for Israel and the Jewish people--God's chosen. This is an excellent guide to help us pray scripturally--not only for Jewish people but for all of Abraham's descendents. Another book I would highly recommend isWhy Care about Israel?: How the Jewish Nation Is Key to Unleashing God's Blessings in the 21st Century
1,fake product,"I bought this product because it was a great buy. Upon opening the bottle, I quickly noticed the cream was a different color and texture from the bottle I bought at Macys. When applying I again noticed the feel was completely different, I do not believe this cream is authentic.I contacted the seller with my complaint. To my surprise, the response I received back was a form letter. Almost like they have recieved several complaints about fake products. No refund or replacement was offered.I will never buy from this seller again, as I am convinced the very expensive Shiseido cream was replaced with something else. I have been using this product for 3 years and absolutely could tell the difference.BUYER BEWARE-DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER-IF THE PRICE IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE-IN MY OPINION IT IS(FROM THIS SELLER)"
4,"Great ""idea"" book","Not a must have book, but certainly a great supplement to your bartending library. Great photos and layout, it is the type of recipe book that is easily flipped through until a photo or title catches your eye. Nice book to take along on beach vacations."
3,Okay,We own the series and this one is okay. My daughter is 5 and picks this one occasionally. The story is somewhat strange for these times.
2,Fell apart,"This scale worked just fine but after about a month, the little digital display box detached from the underside of the glass and I could never get it reattached properly. Quite annoying."
3,Lack of color prints,"While the book is well written and very informative, it is sorely lacking in color plates. Color plates are essential in a book dealing with uniforms. Black and white pictures just don't cut it for uniform descriptions. There are only about 5 or six color plates in the entire thing.Amin"
3,Good Pakistan 101 Overview,"While I only rated this with 3 stars, it is not because this book lacks merit. Unfortunately, I was looking for something that was a graduate-level text vice a 101 text. This is a very easy read, and provides the reader with a good introduction to the sections of Pakistan and their associated issues. In addition, the author does a good job of introducing the major characters of Pakistani history during the last 40 years - Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, General Zia, Nawaz Sharif, Benazir Bhutto, and Gen Musharraf. This book should be read by those attempting to gain greater context to current events in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This book is similarly written and as valuable as Sarah Chayes's Punishment of Virture."
2,Very Disappointing Read,The reason I gave this book two stars is because I recently read Steve Coll's Ghost Wars. I found many of the same references when reading Weaver's book that Coll had so brilliantly researched in Ghost Wars. I almost felt like Weaver may have borrowed some lines and phrases from Coll's book. I would save my money and buy Coll's book for a better researched book on the topic of Pakistan. Weaver needs to go back to Journalism 101 and look at ethics.
4,Great Work and lots of fun reading it,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Actually, its a record, I finished it in a day :-). Very insightful and fun.As Marry Anne Weaver attests to the complexity of Pakistan, I think it is disingenuous to blindly proclaim Pakistan as the cause of radicalism and terrorism in that region--as some reviewers have suggested. National liberation and provincialism has always found religious recruits in many conflicts around the world throughout history.The Tamil Tiger independence movement in Sri Lanka is a case in point: it created the depravity and ugliness of suicide murderers, it was fueled in part by foreign powers, India being one of them. Over 60 thousand people died.Before blaming a country, religion or people for all evils, its time we assess each situation individually and understand the complexity."
2,bad quality,"Came on time but was almost destroyed in quality, book was obviously a library discharge. very disappointed and if i didn't love the book,' would've Sent it back"
3,Lexar 128MB JumpDrive use for PS2,Bought this JumpDrive because it supposedly could be plugged into the slimline version of the PS2. Doesn't work for that function. Does work as normal flashdrive though.
3,It's OK,I probably wouldn't buy it again if I need another guitar stand. I bought it because I didn't want a locking stand. Since its job is just to sit there and hold a guitar it does it pretty well. But the rubber cushion where the legs intersect slides off every time I pick up the guitar and that's pretty annoying.
5,Works great,This works for both a full-size electric and a junior-size electric one as well. Seems to be well constructed and is padded so there is no concern that guitars will be scratched. Guitars rest pretty upright so you can put this fairly close to the wall. Folds together but seems to be a little big to fit into a gig bag but our gig bags are pretty inexpensive and the pockets are on the smaller side.
4,Very good if..,"you have a heavy package indifferentiel geometrycomplex analysistopological algebrariemann geometry.If not, forget it."
4,"Well-organized, but doesn't really reveal anything new","Lillian has written several books on Feng Shui and if you're like me, and have read some of the other ones, you'll not really find too much new information in this one.It's a bit like a handbook, quite useful if you're new to FS, but are familiar with the very basics - but don't expect anything that'll make you go WOW."
4,Great reference book!,Great book to have on the shelf to assist with feng shui consultations. I find Lillian Too easy to understand and great value for money. She is a very shrewd business woman which has turn the more esoteric consultants away from her but I have always found her refreshingly to the point with memorable antedotes.
4,Acid Breaks from the Master,From the moment the first track starts you begin to realize that Terry Mullan does not fake the funk.A few seconds later you hear the intro to one of everyones favorite cartoons.The entire cd is like an exaggerated reverb as deep as want.The cd is layed out as one track so his mixing skillz are really represented here.The only reason I did not give this record five stars is because I know his next presentation will be better yet.Buy this one and set the standard for music everyone wants to own.peace
5,Rock and Roll Lover,"Wow Little Feat all acoustic on two CD's. I do like the electricstuff better, but this CD does not have a bad song on it.Shaun Murphy shines on the CD, Her singing on ""On Your Way Down""gave me goose bumps. I didn't think ""Easy To Slip"" could be sungby anyone but Lowell George. I was proved wrong, Easy To Slipand I Know You Rider was the High Light for me.Rams Head will be in my CD player for a long time."
3,good musicanship but....,"can't agree with other reviewers ,these songs just don't work as well with anybody other than Lowell singing them ,the band is just as good as ever but there's something missing .Even the Craig Fuller era feat were close but only as he sounded so much like Lowell.Not a patch on ""Waiting for Columbus"" their fantastic live album from 1978 .Also have to criticize the sound quality ,rather thin and lacking real prescence,seems everybody these days likes to put a pickup on their accoustic guitars which does not give you the natural accoustic sound.Every group has to call it a day eventually"
5,EXcellent... just what I needed!!!,"this is so fabulous. I know the basics of technique and just need to learn beats, it is SO clear and fun. A MUST HAVE."
2,started to crack less than a month,i purchased this chopping block and used it for less than a month and already started cracking (picture enclosed). we had purchased two other Boos but they have been great for over three years.
1,no,These are way over priced. I have two sizes for 30 to 50 dollars less. Please stop trying to rip people off. not cool.
4,Awesome little coffee table book,"Beth Fox gave a fabulous and serious review above, and I'll add to it just to say that almost all of the photos in this book were taken from one photographer, so it's really just one person's limited view of the fashion from that era.But it's very, very entertaining nonetheless."
3,"Okay film, Felt a Touch Long---- Spoiler Free Review","****SPOILER FREE REVIEW***Was in the mood for a drama, something not so hollywood so I grabbed this film. Pesci will always give you a good performance, overall, I liked all the acting, well done guys. The characters felt real. The plot wasn't as laid out as i'd like though. It sorta meanders a touch. Hmmm..... meanders is the wrong word. I guess you really don't quite know what to expect and the movie just develops around the characters' actions. Sorta like real life I suppose.Second half of the movie is definitely when things pick up.Overall, I liked the film, would recommend if you are in the mood for an atypical drama with a few interesting elements."
2,Waste of time,"Alas, there is not one character in this movie that this viewer cared about, and it is difficult to like a movie with this flaw. There are a man and wife who own a Nevadan brothel, various working girls, a cretinous boxer, etc. The plot requires one to accept premises that are hard to swallow--for example, the ""affair"" between Ms. Mirren and the Argentinian boxer. The writer got things into such a state of affairs that the only way to end this was an event akin to a deus ex machina. To provide a modicum of realism, the dialogue is full of profanity--about every other word.In short, as the reader may have guessed, I am not a fan of this sort of work."
3,WANNA SEE HELEN MIRREN HALF NUDE?,Well this is your chance. Joe Pesci is hilarious as always. A cast of real classics out in the dessert strut their stuff for the knife wielding maniacs. You could live without seeing this movie but why risk a date with madness?
4,"Well, I liked it","Other reviews have described the movie's content perfectly. I've nothing to add to any of them. But to me, this was a very funny, well-acted, beautifully photographed movie. Hellen Mirren was just excellent and so was Joe. If type casting were banned, many actors would no longer work. Pesci does his character as really only he can, and it fit here as well as it ever has elsewhere. The image of a small, inelegant, cheesy, gaudy pleasure palace destination isolated in a vast, at times frozen, desert worked great for me.I'd seen the Biography version of the story and thought this was well done fun."
1,VACUOUS,"In 2006 I had the great good fortune to be shown round Cardinal Newman's rooms in the Oratory in Birmingham, England.The elderly priest (now dead) who showed me round happened to mention Gallonio's `Life of Saint Philip Neri'. ""There's nothing in it,"" said the elderly priest, ""I don't know why the bothered to republish it."" Having just read the book, I had come to just the same conclusion.Look elsewhere for a good biography of Saint Philip."
2,Supposedly good for cleft babies,"My fourth son was born with a cleft lip and palate. Since he couldn't breastfeed but seemed to have a high suck need, I decided to try a pacifier with him. Regular ones gagged him or fell out. But everyone suggested this one. Basically, it's a Soothie sewn to a stuffed animal, and the idea is the animal's weight helps hold it for baby or baby can hold the animal and hold the pacifier. Good idea, but it didn't work for him. The weight pulled it out of his mouth, and he did not like holding it. It's worth a try, but it's sure not the solution all the ""experts"" suggested it would be."
5,"Love, Love, Love it!","I love this thing! My 9wk old son rolls to his side to sleep, and the wubbanub stays tucked in his arms - he can get the paci back in his mouth by himself, saving me many trips into his room:)"
3,"Great Idea, Fuction needs work","I needed a pacifier to stay in my sons mouth while sleeping. This was the perfectidea. I had alreayd made 1 myself at homoe, but it was stupid looking. Mine turned out better becuase it was a little bigger and heavier so it spread out across the infants chest to keep the pacifier in place and he held onto it. This one was MUCH better lookig but it was so light it fell out all the time. the legs really needed ot be BEAN BAG FILLED. I have a frog with bean beg legs and made my own. It's a great idea and probably works for most, it just didn't for me."
5,Wubbanuberiffic,"We have twin girls that are almost 2 months. Wubbanums have been a life saver. When one or both starts screaming, they are instantly soothed by the pacifier and because of the extra weight the stay in as opposed to other pacifiers that fall out followed by even great cries.Of all the things we have gotten so far wubbanubs has been the best!"
1,broken nipple,"This pacifier came to me with a ripped nipple. I was going to have to jump through hoops to get a new one, which I did not have time to do. So basically a waste of 10.00 plus s/h because it became a possible choking hazard."
4,Keiko Matsui Dream walk,Beautiful and relaxing with a combination of her heritage and western style music. I simply love listening to her music.
2,light weight,"Firstly, the sound quality is of demonstration quality. On a revealing system this disc sounds terrific. As to the musical performance, totally pro. As to musical content, superficial pop-oriented tunes pretending to be New Age.For fans of Kenny G only, or perhaps people who take exceedingly long rides in elevators."
5,"An Effective Combination, But Still Risky","These two powerful drugs act in the brain. Phentermine is extremely safe alone as a weight loss tool and can be taken for, for the most part, indefinitely. As is Prozac. But when you combine these two no matter what, there is going to be some side effects. As a doctor myself I believe in Anchor's idea of treatment of obesity like any other medical condition.In my opinion, stick w/ phentermine or Prozac, but don't combine them."
2,XPW History,"This DVD is a brief early history of XPW before theirmajor shows at the Grand Olympic Auditorium and beforethey fully developed their talent.-There is a match between Damien Steele VS Chris Candidoand the end is good, its a (2 star match).-The great Debut of Shane Douglas in XPW-Lizzy Borden History-White Trash Johnny Webb History (funny interview)-Messiah History-Messiah VS White Trash Johnny Webb (clips)-Supreme History-Supreme VS Axl Rotten (who has a psycho mullet) (clips)-King of Deathmatch (clips)-Kristy Mist History-Chris Candido VS Homeless Jimmy (clips)-White Trash Johnny Webb (2 star match)Pros-History-Decent Production-T & ACons-Incomplete Matches-Some Bad Audio-Repeated Video Clips-Not Very Long For A DVD"
4,"Good, but just it","A good book, but just it.It's like a normal book. It's not bad but not excellent..."
1,Tired of finding an alternative,"This book is a pain to follow. The authors have assumed readers would have a certain level of background knowledge. With this book being the preferred material in most univs wouldn't they bother to make it more understandable, include a few basic chapters for the users' benefit? It doesn't take the reader from a low level and walk him up, instead it starts somwhere at the top and stays there making it very difficult for users to follow the material. The frustrating part is I have not been able to find alternatives to this book for understanding the basics.One review suggested that a person should never go near this book unless his/her IQ is 130 or above. I have an IQ of over 130 and I'm groping in the dark. Would not recommend it to anyone but would love to see posts suggesting alternatives."
2,A Butchered Classic,"I've heard that the first edition of this book is a classic. Reading the second edition, I can kind of see that -- occasionally there will be a stretch of 5 pages or so that is wonderfully clear, concise, and informative.But overall, this edition is a disappointment. The explanations tend to be mechanical and unhelpful, and are sometimes confused or just incorrect. New sections on mathematical foundations and applications have been added, but there isn't really adequate space devoted to covering either topic, and the results are so rushed and lacking in context that I can't see those sections being useful to anyone who would need them in the first place. Finally, this edition needs to be proofread for correctness! It contains numerous mistakes, some of them in the presentations of key proofs."
2,Could be better,"As a student using this book, I simply found it a little too difficult at times to grasp what the concepts were. The examples, at times were just too complicated, and could have been done better with easy to understand examples. Not so sure about this one. However, if you are already tamed in automata theory concepts, I'm sure you'll love it."
1,"first edition is a classic, the second one unremarkable","The first edition is one of the best book in its field. A classic. A reference for many advanced courses in computer theory.Sadly, the second edition misses a great deal of the first edition. Many chapters were removed. Important lemmas and theorems are missing.I would gladly exchange my second edition for the first one, if it wasn't out of print.J."
3,"Not bad, not great","They actually look very nice for just a cheap pair of blue boxers. The back has that weird ballon seat thing on your butt, but its not uncomfortable so its fine in my opinion. The only problem is the waist band, even if the boxers feel loose the elastic and fabric seem to leave irritated skin marks around my waist... Other than that they're great, but weird marks around my waist that look like i've been shrink wrapped is not sexy so that lost 2 stars."
1,Disappointed to the Fullest!!,"I ordered this book on August 13, 2010 and today is September 14 (which means a month has passed), and my book has yet to be shipped. I'm very upset about the fact that I cannot cancel this order and get the book elsewhere because I don't want to be charged twice. This is pitiful and I REGRET ordering the darn thing now. I mean if you have the book why on earth would it take more than a month to send the freaking thing out??!!! :-("
4,KUDOS,"Finally, a good sequel. This book was a good read. If you read and liked Blinded, then you should really pick this one up. REAL TALK. It didn't dwell on Blinded's story. It was a whole new story with even some new characters. Like, Sweetie, the thievin bohemian. It also has more to the stories of the characters from the last book. Yall remember what Mona caught Kenny doing in Blinded. Not to mention her hot friend Nee. Ah yea, this book has some BUTTA to it. Go head Kashamba keep doing your thang. I'll support you."
1,Grimey,I just bought Blinded and I haven't read it yet. I didn't read this title yet either. I just want to say it's ok to review a book but please DON'T give away too much detail or the ending. Just a word of advice for people giving a review. It just takes away from someone who hasn't read it yet. I don't want to start a book knowing what's going to happen to a character before hand. You can review it and not tell it.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME...,This writer needs and Editor quickly. Who reviewed this book before being published. It skips around way too much. And way to unbelievable. Who in their right mind would believe that someone gets away with 1.5 million dollars and then opens up a group home....this is suppose to be real street drama this is sooo fake.TRIPLE CROWN HAS SOME GREAT WRITERS BUT NOW THEY NEED TO INVEST SOME OF THEIR MONEY INTO EDITING.
2,Editing was terrible.....,"I know I am about to be hated on for this review. But I have to be honest. This book was all over the place.Blinded was excellent. I don't know what this was, maybe the author was trying to get another phenomenal message across but the story was to scattered. I am sure some people will still enjoy this story but a sequel this was not,so you don't have to read Blinded first or read this after you read Blinded because it won't make any difference. I don't want this to take away from my feelings on Blinded because that still was a great book. But don't waste your money on this book. Borrow it!!!!!!"
3,As the Evil World Turns,"Kashamba Williams comes back with the sequel to her hit book, Blinded, in the form of Grimey. This novel picks up right where the previous book leaves off as Mona Foster is put to rest by her grieving family. El'san and Sweetie become star crossed lovers this go around and Cam is still out on the grind in the streets. While a drug war over the right to sell drugs within the various Boroughs of New York City threatens to ensue; Mona's brother, Yatta, is determined to make Cam pay for his involvement in his sister's untimely death.William's sophomore novel is a good read for those interested in a play by play account of street life. The book also shines a bright light on the adage, ""what goes around comes around."" The only thing missing from the book is Mona Foster. Her vivacious and eclectic personality really made the previous book come alive for me as a reader. I would recommend this book to anyone caught up in ""street life.""AnnaR.E.A.L. Reviewer"
5,Have not been disappointed yet,"I HAVE TO SCREAM BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN SAY THEY DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK..I LOVED IT! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I WAS SO OPEN THAT ON MY WAY HOME I HAD TO STOP THE CAR AND READ. I WILL NOT SPOIL IT FOR ANYONE, BUT IF YOU LIKE TO READ YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK.. TRIPLE CROWN HAS DONE IT AGAIN.. I WILL KEEP READING UNTIL I'M BROKE!"
3,Not sequal material,"I thought this was supposed to be about Mona and getting revenge? Instead we have a whole new group of characters that tell a different story and focus on something totally different. Of course Camron was still out cold and he got his in the end, but this was not a sequal. This book held it's own and you don't necessarily need to read blinded to get this book. It wasn't as good as blinded and most of the dialogue was unnesessary."
4,Perfect size and height for patio coffee table.,"This table is about twice the table you would expect at the price. Its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench. Kompur wood is so like teak; we're staining our teak furniture to match the Kompur wood. It looks marvelous with the 30"" round folding table. Fit and finish are A Plus. Can't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars."
5,Excellent value.,This coffee table is great for the money. Well packed for shipping and easy to put together.
3,"Not teak, but wears well","I thought this would be more like teak than it really is. Not the fault of the design (it's sturdy and a good value), but don't expect the nice grain, even gray weathering and solid oak feel of teak."

5,Alright - tested -- it works,"Well I just threw an old cell phone in the pouch, folded the opening, and velcroed the pouch. After submerging the phone it appeared dry."
4,Robert Burns has still got it!,"What a great idea, a pocket version of my favorite poet's works. It conveniently sits by my bed table for reading at any time of the day or night. As small as it is, approximately 9X7"", surprisingly the print is large enough to comfortably read.My grandfather McAulay... would quote ""Bobby Burns"" to me as a child at his knee ever since I can remember. A poet from his own country was very special to him and now Mr. Burns has become very special to me."
4,Nice travel book,This is a hard back book and small enough to go just about anywhere. This does not seem to be a collection of all his works but there is a lot there and certainly all the works I was familiar with. The poems are printed in the center of the page so they to not look cluttered with the possibility of copious notes if you would like. There is a small forward in the front of the book about Robert burns and a small scots dictionary at the back. Over all nice. The down side is that I have found a couple of spelling errors in the book and the dictionary is nowhere near what is required to get a full understanding of what was written but many good online resources exist.Over all I like the book and the discovery contained in the pages.
4,Help Take the Fear out of Filing for Bankruptcy,"This book is great whether you are thinking about filing for bankruptcy or not. It lays out the bankruptcy story pretty well and it is scary. The part I like the most was the end of the book where they tell you how to clean up your credit and credit reports, stay out of financial trouble, plan around bankruptcy, avoid getting taken and all of that. Four Stars ****"
4,GREAT SOUND BUT SOME DESIGN GLITCHES,The sound quality is exceptional and the sleek design attractive EXCEPT the LED read-out can't be seen from more than a few feet away and forget about putting the oversized remote in it's holder -- it'll be the first thing you'll knock over evey time you reach for anything near it. I would have preferred the updated model but couldn't find it for sale in the U.S. Eton seems to have some sort of distribution rights for Grunding products and they won't bring it into the states. Guess you could buy one in the U.K if you happen to be there.
2,An entertaining fall from grace,"This is the best bad book I couldn't put down.Like most first novels, S.P. reads like the author assigned every detail of his own life to his protagonist. And this down to the most agonizing piece of minutia. We need to believe in the power of Lettieri's imagination, not whether he accurately remembered the color of his fax machine and what it sounded like at 4pm. The writing tends to be melodramatic and awkward in spots, giving away too much of the author's emotional history. Subtlety, sir, mystery, suspense, brave soldier! Hold back, and that which seeps through will be all the more powerful.This said, the book was compelling enough to read in a couple sittings. There was just something about it, an unexplicable charm. And some of the sentences are quite good."
3,Mommy Breastfeeds our Baby,"I was disappointed when I got the book. It is more like abooklet that you would get at the Dr.'s office ...........But the story is not bad except if you have a boy. Which I do, the last page is not exceptable for a boy only girls. So when we read it to our son, we will just skip that. It is okay. If you really don't know how to approach the subject with your child then this will help."
4,One Kiss,"Crossover - Latin sound. Married to famous Chuck Loeb. Her voice is light, sad and romantic. She means what she says, You feel her emotions."
5,Inner Strength in Drumming (and Music),"This book helped me evolve into a much better drummer and musician.It explains how you can harness the Mind, Body and Spirit to reach a higher potential. I now know how being clear and focused can increase my level of communicating my music and drums in particular to my audience. I see more people dancing to the music I play now, because I am giving off a more positive and enjoyable vibe (groove), and thats what its all about. Technically the exercises are totally effective, and have given me the freedom to be confident and relaxed. This will absolutly make you a better drummer and also more aware of your musical surroundings, as well as helping you reach your positive potential as a person."
1,A punk mockery of weezer,"I am a huge Weezer fan and I love punk so I was really excited when I found this CD. I was very disappointed. ""Holiday"" is the only song I could actually listen to on the whole CD. The cover of the Sweater Song is without a doubt THE WORST song I have ever heard. DON'T BUY THIS CD!! Save your 15 bucks and just listen to the original Weezer recordings! =w= rocks."
2,"I expected a compilation, not re-recordings","Seven of the ten songs on this CD are ""new stereo recordings."" Even when done by the original artists, they're not as good as the original recordings. Among the three ""original"" songs is ""Splish Splash"" by Sha Na Na (?!) instead of Bobby Darin. All in all, a disappointment."
1,Not Originals,"If you are looking for the original recordings that were playedon pop radio, this is not the CD for you. While not deceptive,(K-Tel does say on liner notes that some recordings are new, stereo recordings)some are billed as originals when they are not. Some recordings are longer than the original 45RPM recordings. Companies should be more forthright in their advertising bystating that ""This is not the original 45RPM recording"". Ifyou are after the originals---BEWARE! You are wasting your money."
1,Dumb Ditties,"About 70% of the songs on here are re-recordings by the original artists. Cool that they're the original artists, not cool that they're re-recorded. For example, Lil Red Riding Hood is kept close to the original... but it just doesn't sound right in hi fidelity and modern mixing equipment."
3,Definitely not an Easy Watch!,"Not surprisingly from a Royal Shakespeare Company production, the emphasis in this rendering of King Lear is placed on acting. Potential viewers should therefore not expect a filmed theatrical performance with the energy it entails from the interaction with the public nor a truly cinematographic piece with sophisticated sets, sound and lighting à la Kenneth Branagh.There are no subtitles to make the text easier to follow and given the movie's very considerable length, close to three hours, a significant effort is required from the watcher, despite the actors' undeniable talent.Accordingly, this work is recommended to Shakespeare cognoscenti who are already familiar with the play and willing to explore acting subtleties."
5,This Lear is impressive!,McKellan heads a good cast and helps any audience appreciate and learn from the history of the time and Shakespeare's message.
2,It Doesn't Work as a Film,"The over-wrought acting, which works on the stage, is a problem in this film. My students broke into laughter as Glouster ""falls"" from the cliff and in numerous other spots. They were also troubled by the hanging of the fool. I shall not show it the next time I teach Lear."
1,Question on Aspect Ratio,"Why is it that the British BBC version of this DVD (Region 2) is 1.78:1 while this American PBS version is 1.33:1? In this era of wide-screen TV, this is outrageous that we cannot get a widesccreen DVD of this in the US."
5,A recipe for serenity...,"I've owned the Waking Hour CD for three months (a gift from a dear friend) and only recently did this musical poetry truly resonate within me...Here's my advice: On a bright summer day, take a towel, bottle of water, CD Walkman and THIS album and head to the beach. As the sun beats down and THE WIND PICKS UP, let this angel's voice fill you from head to toe. I promise, it will be a transcendental experience: ""did you know you're so beautiful on the edge of summer that years from now I'll cry to remember how very close you were..."" You will simply be swept away by all the magic this CD has to offer!"
4,Honest and Melodic,Seldom am I haunted by music as pleasantly as I am by Vienna's ageless and angelic voice. She has a very clean and poetic style that is honest and peaceful. The piano works well with her voice too.
5,I love Vienna Teng,"Never in my life would I imagine such a talented singer would come my way. Listening to her songs feels like she is singing out your emotion. I wish there's a lot I could comment on each song, but there just isn't because all her songs are just pure wonderful. If you haven't listened to Vienna, you're missing out on one of the most talents singers EVER."
4,Beautiful Voice,"When I first heard one of her song clips, I was instantly attracte to her beautiful voice. That was enough to hook me in. My favourites are ""Gravity"" and ""Between""."
3,Vienna Teng...Walkng Hour.,"It's a good cd. Worth owning. Her best is Warm Strangers, I highly recommend that one."
3,"songs pleasant, but vocals weak","I gave this a listen since others had compared Vienna Teng to Tori. The songs were pleasant, but I found Vienna's the lyrics to be fairly trite, the songs mostly similar in quality and tone, and her vocal ability wavering. The piano playing is adequate. Honestly, I felt like I was listening to a female Jim Brickman and really, do we need one of those? There was just nothing interesting for me. But, if you're into an album that will help you fall asleep at night, this may be a good choice. Vienna needs to experiment a little more with edgier styles and maybe then she'll get my attention."
5,"Beautiful, poignant","Vienna approaches each of her songs like a person, and it shows in the unique sense of aliveness and meaning that buoys each of them. Her rich voice and lovely piano accompaniment produce sounds that are a pleasure to hear. She's like a drug--addictive and oh-so-wonderful. There's talent and beauty enough here to delight anyone who truly appreciates lovely music."
4,"Great eigties pop album, but not Meredith at her best.","Let's face it: The 1980's music scene was filled with many identical albums by different people. Meredith Brooks fit right in with this album. Unfortunately, it was released after Blurring the Edges, so it didn't get the appreciation it deserved during the eighties. Meredith fans should definitely buy this album. It is great for parties. If you are looking for Meredith Brooks on a five star level then you need to buy ""Blurring the Edges."" Meredith Brooks is one of the greatest singers and guitarists working today, and this album allows for fans to see her transition into the ""Bitch"" she is today."
1,This simply is the worse album I have ever heard.,"Yeah exactly, I was ashamed to be an 80s music lover after hearing this one!"
1,Look elsewhere for recipes,"If you want to actually cook paella, look elsewhere for your recipes. The book is attractive, and with so many recipes I was looking forward to years of trying them out. However, my copy is now full of my notes on what is wrong with the recipes and how to improve things for the next attempt. I can only conclude that the author's passion for paella never extended to actually using her recipes."
3,Don't buy the Kindle Version,"This review is for the Kindle version.Bought the Kindle version for the iPad. I've downloaded many other books to read but never a cookbook. I know PAELLA! and have helped make a variety of paellas from it and some were very good. Needing some ideas for a hastily planned paella dinner for 8 I downloaded the book. Unfortunately the Kindle version does't have photos which I think are important if you want to know how to present the dish. For example, squid ink paella, yeah we all know it's black, but would a newbie know to to place the red peppers on top? Yes the recipes are good so get the hard copy and know what they'll look like when you're done."
3,Needs Photos,"The recipes are clear and easy, but not very many for actual Paella. Color photos would have been nice for a better idea of what each dish might look like."
4,Wonderful Paella Cookbook,"An excellent book that goes beyond just listing recipes.Author describes places she's eaten, personalities in the kitchen and something of the dietary culture of Spain.I would definitely recommend this book to the Paella and tapas enthusiast."
5,Paella in Depth,I prepare Paella at least once a week now instead occasionally during the year. This book of accessable recipes is informative and very enjoyable . It makes Paella what is should be...an easy part of your weekly menu. Don't miss Ms. Casas's book on Tapas.
3,"A+ for ingredients, D- for method","After trying a couple of paellas from this book, I have to agree with the person who criticized the recommended cooking method. Baking the seafood for 20 minutes ruins it, rendering the shrimp tough and other seafood dry and tasteless. I had much better success with stovetop cooking, adding the seafood during the last five minutes or so. Perhaps baking the paella would work better if the seafood was added later rather than earlier. Ingredient lists and proportions are right on the mark, with the resulting flavors garnering highest marks."
2,Nice try.,"Ms. Casas seems to have the mistaken idea that all long-grain rice is ""converted"". It's not.Also, I don't believe that a recipe that cooks for 10 minutes in a gas oven would take 20 in an electric, ""even when (the electric is) properly calibrated"". Heat is heat, unless the oven is a convection model. Maybe she ought'a calibrate her GAS oven.THE HERITAGE OF SPANISH COOKING, by Alicia Rios and Lourdes March, tells you how to cook a paella on top of the stove, and by extension, the grill, like they do in Spain and New Orleans."
2,Big Mistake.,"I ordered this book overnight delivery because I was psyched to read it after being told how good it was. As soon as I opened it I didn't like the feel of the paper used. Not like Bobby Flay's cookbooks or Tyler's Ultimate. There were no pictures of the finished meals, which I love to look at. I guess I need books with lots of pictures. LOL.I spent plenty of money on a paellera and paella burner and was hoping to get recipes to use with that type of gear. I will not be putting my paella in the oven any time soon. How will you get that delicious socarrat? Might as well watch YouTube and get ideas from there.I will give it two stars because the recipes Ms. Casas gives us are still useful. At least it gives you a list of ingredients and you can go from there. Just don't put it in the oven.I would have purchased Paella Paella instead, but I'll wait for someone like my sister to buy it for me because it's not cheap. I will probably get her Tapas book though.I'm bummed."
2,Too heavy to bring out the curl,The product I used to use under this name would bring out the curl in my hair and hold it. This is more like a frizz control and weighs doen the curl.
2,Not worth for the quality,"Lot's of static and very poor sound quality. Intereference with any other device within the range. I had Jabra earlier, no match to it."
2,"Good try, but missed the basics","The sound quality is average for a BT stereo BT headset. I really like the idea of combing the standard mono cell phone headset with the stereo capabilities, but it basically misses on both fronts because the ear pieces do not stay in place and are painful. I am an earbud fan, and these are the worst I have ever seen. I have had this for several months and neither I or my wife ever really use it because it is too uncomfortable and the earbuds do not stay in place. It does not stay in place on the train. I would never even consider it for working out, even with no motion and they do not stay in place. Unfortunately, I have not seen another attempt at this, because I love the concept. I will take it on international business trips where I can use the one piece with my WM smartphone to skype. This is the only useful application I have found. Buy the Motorola Rocker S9 and a decent hands free."
2,Buttons make this unusable.,"Only use this a couple of days before returning it. The call button is so stiff, it's next to impossible to press while the headset is in your ear. Even when I held the unit in one hand and pressed the button with the other, you were never sure if the press registered. The volume buttons were not this stiff though.The one PRO I can give this headset is that I was surprised at how high the volume was. I never had problems hearing what I was listening to, whether it was a call or music from the phone."
3,Dont walk away,dont plan on walking very far from your phone.it has a range of maybe 10 feet. The button you push to connect is hard to push. It feel like you are jamming it into your ear just to turn in on.
3,Plantronics Discovery 650E,Nice bluetooth. Small. Sounds good. Easy to connect to your cell. Can charge via power adapter or triple a battery. Multiple ear piece configurations. Can wear with your sunglasses.Not so good: Keeps falling out of your ear.
4,Worth the money...,"I bought this device because of the price and the the fact that it can simultaneously pair with two devices. The features are as you'd expect and it doesn't waste your money with items like a readable screen ( I owned one that had this feature, could never read it when it was in my ear!) The battery life hasn't been challenged. It comes with a handy battery charger/carry case so you can recharge it while you park and run a quick errand. The modular charger neatly integrates with a home charger.The reason it doesn't get a five-star rating is that I think it does not stop charging and drains the battery - however, I must admit that I haven't confirmed this."
4,worth it,I am very satisfied with this headset; it is even priced just right. Good product features and design. The button to answer calls seems at first hard to press but it really isn't. You just need to get a feel for it. I would recommend it.
4,Works great - a few observations,"The headset is a little heavy and tends to fall out when walking - the included ear clip helps but makes things bulky and hard to get into the charger. As other reviewers noted - without the pen charger your stuck. Functionally very good, pairs quickly works well. The answer button is difficult to press when on ear. Still gave the item 4 stars, high construction quality, and works well."
4,I love Plantronic,"i've had over 4 different headsety but nothing compares. Ordering a Plantronic headset product... you can never go wrong! This headset is great if your alway on the go, and the mobile charger!"
2,Painful Static-Returning it!,"I was not happy with this product. There is just way too much static. The only thing I liked was the ear bud, which fits my ear just fine because I have small ears. The pairing was difficult, sometimes it will pair on it's own, most of the time I have to pair it manually because I use it for both my computer on Skype and on my cell when I go out. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Great value,"Overall i'm very satisfied. The feature set is good, the ease of use and sound quality and connectedness to my handset exceeds my expectations. The battery takes 2-3 hours to charge (which is a bit longer than to recharge my handset) but overall, a great value and good unit."
2,"PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE 655, 665, OR 925","This headset did not work well at all. Although the unit was loud enough, the people that I tried to talk to on the phone had trouble understanding me and I also had trouble understanding them. The noise cancellation feature of Plantronics more expensive models mostly cures this problem. Also, the headset's bluetooth connection to my RAZR V3 dropped almost every time that I was close to another cell phone or a computer system, sometimes for thirty seconds or more. This was very annoying. I returned this headset and replaced it with a Plantronics Discovery 655 from DBROTH through Amazon.com which I am was very happy with until I got it soaking wet and ruined it.Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Ultimate Bluetooth Headset with DSP for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones-RetailPlantronics Discovery 665A Bluetooth Headset (Black/Silver)Plantronics Discovery 925 - Headset ( in-ear ear-bud ) - wireless - Bluetooth 2.0 EDR"
3,Headset,"Was a great headset, with one major flaw.I could not put the ear clip over my ear, using only one hand, which i usually do before i drive.Also buttons were a bit tough to press with one hand while wearing, and it didn't call the last dialed number when pressed."
3,should have noise cancellation feature,"price is right when this is on sale, but all bluetooth headset should have noise cancellation feature"
1,Spend extra money and don't buy this piece of junk,"Mine only last two months and the eye piece is very uncomfortable. I had a small and medium and neither one felt good in my year and the headset would slide down while i was talking and I'd have to readjust which meant pushing more in my ear and bottom like is, it just doesn't wear good at all. After two months a light came on and wouldn't go off. Tried going through tech support and because it wasn't under warranty, they couldn't help me :(. I don't like things in my ear and seems like most headsets are like that now except one I found by Motorola H710. Lays flat against your ear and quality is great. Price is good too."
2,worked for approx 3 months and then died,"Bought this via amazon through cellularfreaks august of 2009.October unit died, but was able to charge it without any issues, although unit was already fully charged that day with little usage.Now in november until died, now will not charge, the red light will just flicker.I like being able to use this on two cells, but it just died too soon"
2,Poor quality product,"I bought this because it is supposed to work with two phones. So far, I have been so unhappy with this bluetooth headset that I have not taken time to explore its options. The charge barely lasts 8 hours. In addition, the charging device is cumbersome. The ear piece sometimes falls off. All in all, I feel like I wasted my money. This is unusual for a plantronics bluetooth headset. I have owned several. All but this one were reliable."
2,Not as good as expected,I bought this because I thought it was a good price and was able to pair with more than one phone which would be perfect. It works ok but doesn't work with the advertised distance from the handset and the reception/transmission quality is not very good. Most people on the other end of my connection complain about my words being cut off and also static.
2,You get what you pay for...,"Short & sweet. I bought this because it was a good deal and the reviews were decent. The headsets I owned before this were... The Jawbone (Original) which had great audio and battery, but was uncomfortable and unpocketable. Then, the blueant Z9 serviceable comfort, bad sound and lost, due to the unstable built in clip. Moving on to the next victim.In it's defense, this headset is the most comfortable I've ever owned. Bad news? The battery life is unforgivably short. The audio is mediocre. If you're in a quiet place, it's fine. Add ambient noise and the party is over. Also, should you lose the cleverly designed charging case, there is no longer a way to charge it. Had I known this before, it would have been a pass.Spend a few extra bucks.This one's a pass."
4,love it!,"bought this for my iphone, works great. just turn it on, hold near the iphone, and plug in the access code. sounds great in the car, and walking around the house, although did notice some static with distance from iphone. very light, looks cool, barely notice it in your ear, works with or without the ""ear"" wrap attachment. would suggest for iphone users."
1,Mediocre performance for 4 months and then mike stopped working,"I wouldn't get a plantronics after this one again. Performance when working was barely acceptable (short range, lots of static) and then the microphone stopped working. Stay away from this one."
3,Not good enough,"My expectations about this item were higher. Sound quality is bad and I have to speak with the cellphone in my hand to avoid lost of signal. People don't hear me on the other side when I'm in a crowded place. This is my first bluetooth headset and I'm not very happy with it, this might be a reason for its low price. One of the few positive things is its small size."
5,"This is working for me, nothing else has","It is such a relief to have found this book. I am an active person who eats healthy food and I have always struggled with weight. Now, this book has helped me tune in to my body and I really am melting into my natural shape."
5,Best advice yet,"I've always eaten for the ordinary reasons: it was time, I was stressed and sometimes even when I was hungry.This book is teaching me to eat ONLY when I am hungry and to stop when I am comfortable. I am only on the third week of the six week challenge but so far it has been extraordinary. I can eat WHATEVER I WANT and enjoy it. I just have to pay attention to what I am eating and eat only when I am hungry. You'd think that wouldn't be hard but it has been challenging (what? eat without reading?). The payoff? A final end to a lifelong weight problem ... and a body I'd forgotten I had."
5,This works,I lost 75 pounds by using this book. I have also kept off the weight for 15 years by absorbing the mindset that is encouraged by this book. This is not a diet but a new way of thinking about eating.
3,Not nearly as good as Immediate Family,"I bought both ""Still Time"" and ""Immediate Family"" sight unseen after seeing her new book ""What Remains"". ""Still Time"" is a compilation of works from various periods. It is easy to see her promise, and there are some nice photographs. Her progress is interesting. But she really hits her stride when she photographs her children in ""Immediate Family"". Some of the early shots in ""Still Time"" seem sort of concocted and overdone-until the photos from ""Immediate Family"" which are breathtaking. Save your money and buy ""Immediate Family""."
1,Immensley Dissapointing,"I gave my 6 year old niece a camera for her birthday. It's just a simple point and shoot. Then I purchased ""Still Time"" I couldn't believe the resemblence. Although, I would recommend any of my nieces photo's over any in the collection by Sally Mann. Not because it's from a 6 year old and not because she's my niece but because they are better.I have 3 other collections by Sally Mann and I continue to be facinated with her talent. I couldn't be more disspointed in wasting my money on a collection such as this.I wonder: Did Sally Mann really take these photo's or does she have a 6 year old niece with a camera?Don't waste your money. Buy any of her other collections."
5,For the SG-1 fans,"Having every episode on DVD may seem a little extreme, but I find it very gratifying to watch one of my favorite shows whenever, in order and commercial-free. I say, AWESOME."
4,"The Boy Friend - Corny Music, but better than the OBC!","I'm fortunate to have gotten the role of Polly Browne in my high school production of THE BOY FRIEND this year (and only a sophomore . . .). I ordered this recording as soon as I got the part. This is fun to learn the basics of the music (before we have music rehearsals).Sure, the music is kinda corny, but then again, so were all the musicals in the 20s, which this is a spoof of. It has a cute storyline, and I am so grateful to play a role a Broadway legend (Julie Andrews) created.!4/5 stars!"
2,John Quincy Adams,"While I appreciated the overview of JQA's life and accomplishments, I'm afraid this book can be boiled down to this: He was a lousy President, lousy father, and a lousy son, and it was all the fault of his lousy parents--especially his lousy mother!"
5,JQA,"Great, concise biography. You will want to read another in-depth bio after this one. You can't read enough about these great ones."
4,"Remini for the defense, your honor....","One can't help but view this biography as if Remini were defending the honor of an individual he clearly found wanting. John Quincy is so much the prideful product of his famous forebears (must read McCullough's John Adams first), that he can't help but fall short in his own right. Particularly insightful is Quincy's stubborn wrong-headedness in his managing of his cabinet appointments, which contributed greatly to a sour legacy. Remini does serve JQ well in praising his foreign policy successes as ambassador and Sec. of State, and provides enlightened review of his post-presidency legislative terms.....but clearly the tone is condemning of a most ascetic and belligerent man reaching beyond his natural skills as a diplomat to underachieve as an executive."
3,an error about an error,"Referring to Marshall Newman's review. The Macaulay that JQA read and Remini mentions was Catherine Macaulay (1731-1791), an historian and a distant relative of T.B. Macaulay (1800-1859)."
4,Sleep much better now.,"Product is great. Just as described - but smaller than a regular pillow. Only problem for me was the shipping. Company sent it out, but it took at least 2 weeks to get it. Wasn't happy about that. Otherwise, I like the pillow."
1,WARNING! Doesn't work in my printer!,I received this sticker packet as a small birthday gift from someone and was all excited to print some stickers! The insert with the directions states that I can use this paper in my Canon i850 inkject printer... BUT I CAN NOT! I even contacted Canon and they told me that I could not and that I should recheck the insert that came with my sticker paper. I did that and it does in fact state that I can use it with my i850! I guess I'll just hang on to this until I upgrade my printer and get a new one. THIS SUCKS!
4,"Can't beat it for the price, but not as fast as advertised.","The pump is nice, but the sprayers are too restrictive. It probably only pushes about half the GPM advertised. I'm going to modify it by adding sprayers and making it cover a wider area.The tank, frame, and wheels are nice though. The lid is vented. The sprayer wand works way better than I'd expect, spraying probably 15-20' constantly or in spurts. You can actually cover a lot more ground using the wand than the rear sprayers.Free shipping was nice. It came in a pretty beat-up box, but nothing was missing or damaged.The cheapest part is the super-thin angle holding the sprayer nozzles (furthest right part of the image). That'll get replaced with the new sprayer setup I'm working on this winter."
3,Kia Sephia 1994 thru 2001 & Spectra 2000 thru 2004 (Hayne's Automotive Repair Manual),It's ok but could be better.
2,"Worth maybe $3 or $4, at most.","I wish I would have paid better attention to the reviews, hopefully you will. This book is at most useful in one or two spots. It has no explanations of grammar or usage, and mostly just lists words and phrases with little organization. There is no way to find a phrase on the spot, you just have to browse the whole book to find what you need. It also provides information that is useless. It actually has a list of words not to say to people. The author includes multiple ads throughout the book promoting his other books, which I seriously doubt are any good if this one is any indication. Its obvious to me that this book was made to advertise the authors other worthless writings. I paid ten dollars, but its not worth more than three or four at most. I won't even be taking it with me when I go.-Sean"
3,"not what I expected, but decent","I bought this book, because I am about to go on a vacation in Costa Rica and wanted to learn some spanish. Although it is a neat little book with a lot of words and phrases, the book is NOT suitable for learning the language. It is really only an addition of words/phrases used in Costa Rica. So I guess if you know spanish, and just want to know the little differences between countries, it is a good help, but as I said it is not suitable for learning spanish."
3,s'ok,"we just got back from costa rica. we dont speak much spanish at all, however, we didn't use this book much at all either. i think we would've done better with a straightforward spanish/english dictionary. we need words for things like 'path' and 'hike' and couldnt find them- this book seems more geared towards those heading to resorts, hotels and bars. We picked up more of the language and got around better by using what was remembered from high school spanish and learning new words from the locals as we went along."
4,My Spanish teacher wanted a copy,I am taking Spanish as a second language in Costa Rica and have brought my copy to class. All the students liked the handy phrases and our teacher wanted her own copy. However the social situation section is too explicit and some of the phrases do not belong a a general guide book.
4,very helpful,"This book may not be best for a first book on speaking Latin American Spanish, however, it has been extremely helpful in helping me with pronunciation and local usage of words."
3,Some of the magic slips away,"This, the second book in Jody Lynn Nye's MYTHOLOGY series, isn't up to par with the original. Much of the book is a travelogue, and while I don't mind those in general, they don't fit well with this series. Also, the main character Keith Doyle is cursed (no spoiler, this; it gets mentioned on the back cover). It's not a terribly destructive curse, but it still is, in fact a curse; but much of the rest of the cast, including Keith's girlfriend, don't seem to be in much of a hurry to break it. This is a shame, as she otherwise is one of my favorite characters, and initially her fierce determenation to rescue Keith is a standout. The humor, thankfully, is still present from the first book, though not quite as funny."
1,Not good. Picture faded. Information is brief and skin-deep.,"I owned more than 10 DVD collections of this genre such as Planet Earth, Walking with dinosaurs. Secret of Life on Earth is ranked at the bottom because of the reasons listed below.- The picture looks washed out. Planet Earth looks sharp, vividly colorful.- The information is very brief and skin deep. It's more suited for grade 6-7 students than for adults.I'm glad I rented it not buying it."
2,Evolution all thru the movie,I loved the cinematography and the food chain explanation and its delicate balance but could have done without all the evolution stuff. These incredible systems could have been designed that way. We will be watching the video without sound. Would recommend IMAX Deep Sea as a better movie.
3,another present for MIL,Mother-in-law doesn't care for this as much as Bailey movies but says it is ok. Keep trying to find dog movies
2,"Cute story, so so execution","I was looking forward to watching this movie after reading the raving reviews. The story is cute and so is the dog. The acting, however, is horrible. It's a very low budget movie and it shows. Very disappointing."
1,This DVD is a poor man's Girls Gone Wild...,"Totally disappointing...you can tell that the producers of this ""presentation"" desparately wanted to ride the coat tails of Girls Gone Wild videos but they fail miserably. In an effort to be tactful, there were way too many ""hefty"" females featured in this presentation. At the end of the day, you will swear you are watching Weight Watchers Girls Gone Wild. To top it off, I was unable to fast forward or rewind this DVD. So if you happen to see a good looking coed amongst the Jenny Craig drop outs, you will be unable to rewind to view this rare treasure. I returned it, assuming I received a defective DVD and received a second DVD. However, I was unable to rewind /ff on the second DVD. Do yourself a favor go buy a Girls Gone Wild Video and avoid this big girl extravaganza."
1,JOURNAL OF GEMS & GEMMOLOGY,HOW COULD AMAZON NOT KNOW THAT THIS MAGAZINE IS WRITTEN IN CHINESE. I PURCHASED THIS MAGAZINE THINKING I COULD GAIN INFORMATION ON GEMSTONES.I AM UNABLE TO READ THIS MAGAZINE AT ALL AND I AM GOING TO ASK AMAZON FOR A REFUND!!
3,CCR SACD,I don't have anything to compare this to as it is my first SACD purchase. I guess I had higher expectations than this could deliver on. It doesn't seem the sound quality is greatly different than other discs.
5,Excellent,"Perfect fit for my Dodge Ram 2500 3/4 Ton truck. The radio looks good, the fit is secure and the kit did not require a lot of cutting of tabs to make it fit. Would recommend."
3,"worked, but barely","bought for my sebring. i ordered the correct part, got the correct part... but didnt quite work. yes i followed the instructions, been in car audio over 11 years... i'm guessing maybe a defect?? either way, most people would of been out of luck, i was able to rig it up. beats paying $30 retail right? you make the decision..."
2,Please read this for a better description.,"Here is a better description of the product. The grain on the wood does not look like oak and the color is very dark, almost cherry. Also, it is made of numerous pieces of wood which are visibly finger jointed together. The metal is black iron with antique bronze drawer handles. If that is the kind of rack you want, you are in luck. If not, look for a nicer rack else where."
4,Superb music by tremendous talent.,I saw the show in London and was intrigued by the storyline and mesmerized by the music. I hope the CD is half as enjoyable.
3,Great music but poor dialogue,"Let me go on record to say, The soundtrack, ten times better than the first one. Great job on that. Loved, It's on my personal favorite, can't back down, walking in my shoes, tear it down, different summers, fire, brand new day,etc. Sadly has the story itself not as good, demi lovato was great. Much more bolder, stronger & confident than the first. But the dialogue was not strong enough. but as soon a song comes on it gets you off your seat. Like I said, music 5 stars. Acting 3."
1,this movie = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i seriously hate this movie its lame and boring and totally unorginial the story is lame the charecters are lame the actors and actresses are lame boring stupid unintelligent and seriously annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,I like it..,"This is a pretty good Disney flick with some catchy toons. I especially like the song ""Introducing Me."" I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first one and enjoys a good musical."
3,ROCK JAM,CAMP ROCK IS A FUN MOVIE WITH SINGING AND DANCING OR HOW TO FIGHT TO SAVE YOUR CAMP TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED NO MATTER IF FANCY OR NOT. WHO EVER IS INTO MUSICALS AND DANCE THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG CROWD.
1,Bad Idea,"I got the filter for the humidifier I also just bought. Upon placing the filter in and turning the unit on, a strong odor filled the room. I had to open the windows to air the room out because I didn't think inhaling the smell was a good idea. Being that it was for my bird's room, I feel sure that it would result in him getting sick or worse. I believe the problem lies in the Protec antimicrobial treatment. I would never have bought it had I known about this."
3,Not sure if it was the right product,"I wished there was a description of what the product was made from, for example this product is plastic. What came with the orginal humidifer was made out of paper."
4,Honeywell replacement filter HC-835,It performs and holds better compare to the one came with the humidifier. Price is great and it is good to buy extra to reduce the shipment cost. I wanted to know if it works with my Humidifier that information was not there but I took a change and it works great.
5,My Favorite,"Dervish Live in Palma is a fantastic set of cds. The sound reminds me a lot of the Bothy Band, only with accordian instead of uilleann pipes. Personally I like this cd more than anything the Bothies ever released. The fiddle is not overdone, so you can actually hear the mandolin, accordion, flutes and whistles . . . all of which are played masterfully. Cathy Jordan's singing, English and Gaelic, sounds even more beautiful than on the studio recordings. I think that ""World's End"" reels and ""Happy Birthday Felip"" are the only numbers not available on Dervish's 3 studio cd's. However even if you already own everything Dervish has released, I recommend getting your hands on this one. I listen to it more than any other cd I own, and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by it."
1,what a shame,"This rather expensive 2 cd-set could have been easily compressed into one if they'd left out all the chit chat uttered by Mrs. Dervish c.s. between the songs. If they really wanted to include this information they could have printed it on the inlay instead of bothering, or should I say disturbing, us during the performance. Honestly, after listening to three tracks I had enough of it and only wondered when Mrs. Dervish would shut her cake hole."
3,Irish Eccentrics,"Things begin slowly but warms-up around 18th and 19th centuries when rich rakes and tossers abounded usually of the absentee landlord variety. This minority Anglo Irish Protestant class ruled the roost at the expense of the dispossessed and coerced Catholic Irish majority of whom little is heard: obviously too busy dying of starvation, or, being hanged or transported. If you want a real laugh in this milieu try finding ""The Irish at Law."" I can't remember the name of the author, unfortunately, who is a member of an Irish legal dynasty."
5,Love his Voice,This is an excellent audio CD of Leonardo's two interviews referrring to Basketball Diaries and Romeo and Juliet. He also mentions Titanic and other movies he has done. Interesting insite to the man that Leonardo was before Titanic mania. Very enjoyable to listen to. Love it!
2,Not a great cover,I found that this shade did not really provide shade in the places I needed it. It obstructed my son's view out and it was really difficult to get him into his rear facing car seat with this installed. There are not a lot of alternatives. We installed a rear window shade that really helped and have not found a great solution for the side window.
4,very informitive,"A very informative book, just a bit overpriced when you can get the same info online for free."
4,It is almost spillproof,"When positioned properly, this urianal works perfectly. It also has a more comfortable rim. It is definitely better than the ones that are issued in the hospitals."
3,Great design BUT,i THOUGHT THIS WOULD SOLVE MY PROBLEMS BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH. THE ONE LITER CAPACITY WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THE PATIENT. HE OVER-FILLED THE URINAL THEREBY NEGATING THE NON-SPILL FEATURE. ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WILL BE APPRECIATED.
5,Thrilling,Great story. Read cover to cover in one sitting! Could not stop until I finished it.Well written and suspenseful.
5,good book to read very interesting information,i started reading this book at bedtime.could not stop till i was finished with it.great read.
3,A useable text,"Morris covers some interesting material. However, I don't believe he did as good a job as he did on The 12th of August. Much of the material in this book is just a reprinting of some of his previous book. I compared the two books as I read this one though and sometimes the wording of conversations had some variation. This book is not well written for someone with the journalistic background of Morris. Yet there are some interesting theories in regard to Buford Pusser's possible involvement in taking out some of those who he believed were involved in murdering his wife. I think the book is an overall worthwhile read but there are places in the text where Morris used vulgarity for no other apparent reason than to be vulgar. It did not help drive home the point any better."
5,The Stateline Mob,"Great true crime story, highlignting not only the career of the late Sheriff Buford Pusser of McNairy County, TN. But also the modern day outlaws that made him famous. Shows two sides of Buford, in his quest for ""Towhead"" White, and other personalities of the Miss/Tenn stateline"
3,Better than the movie,"Well, Mr.Morris is not Shakespere,however he did a lot of reserch and came up with information that was left out of the movie. I found the book to be a good and interesting read. It filled in a lot of holes in the story and I have been looking for information about Mr.Pusser for a while."
1,poor production.,very low on entertainment value. dry and stale. boring interviews with anthropologists. don't show you students they will die from boredom! waste of money!
4,No saints,"Protagonists are presented warts and all and there are no good guys and bad guys. The swedish policewoman's personality seemed a little contrived and the plot wandered quite a ways from reality. However, it was a good show. The presence, and position, of women in all of the scandinavian shows is prominent and they are depicted as responsible, decision making professionals.The cinematography of this series was really first class. The scenes of the bridge and the water were fantastic. The street scenes in both countries were likewise beautiful. We would recommend this to others without hesitation."
4,Narative Textbook,"Although ""Roark seems to emphasize some events that seem less important to U. S. History"" as Mr. Jack A. White stated, this book is written in the narrative stand point. Therefore, it should be read more like a story and not a textbook. If you're using this book in high school, it will be good practice since more college books are narrative."
2,Buy the hardcover,I have read Making of . . . .1960 and 1964. This time I got the soft cover version and the print is too small for comfortable reading for my old eyes. White adds many footnotes and they are in tiny font size. Besides the print is faded and the paper yellowed which adds to the difficulty.White says little or nothing about the personal side of the candidates. I guess that's how he got access to them. He does a good job describing the dynamics of each of the elections which helped me see how strongly the process of candidate selection is influenced by the personal will of factions within the parties.
2,Burnt Chips,"I bought a case of these chips and found three bags had small holes in them at the bottom seams (just big enough for air and/or a bug to get in). So,I had to throw them out. And, many of the chips were broken up and many seemed burnt or way overcooked. I think I'll stick to the supermarket bags next time."
4,Crunchy chips!,"I purchased this item (24 bags). This was my mistake. I normally don't eat chips except when I am close to my period phase. When this order arrived, I ate one bag each day until I came down to 5 bags. I realized what I have done.However, it was yummy and no trans fat. More healthy than most brands.Now I know, I can only order a bag, not 24 bags next time. :)"
2,"Great chips, but I prefer the bag with the blue chips included",Take them to your grocer and exchange these for the bag that also has the blue chips with the other chips.
1,Terra Kettles sea salt krinkle cut potato chips,"I was disappointed, the chips were very oily and tasted and smelled rancid....Since they are supposedly high end snacks they do not live up to their billing."
3,A Bit Too Oily,"Considering that many of the Terra chips are healthier versions of snack foods, it was surprising that these chips were so oily. They have more oil listed on the package than what Amazon actually stated when I bought them. I was disappointed in the overall crunch of these chips. They are a bit too thick to be a true kettle chip and though crunchy, it isn't quite what I expected. They aren't bad, just not really as advertised. Those who like a thick, nearly unsalted chip will enjoy these."
4,"Finally, an intelligent discussion",A thorough and academic treatment of the subject. Gave me a new appreciation for THIS planet though it got a little dense by the end.
1,NEGATIVE FIVE *****s,Could I have read what may be the world's worst book?I practiced Praying Mantis Kung Fu and thought this would give me a few insights... scatalogical would be a compliment... was the author writing in metaphore or just in Klingon?I can't say much about this book because I didn't understand a single page!
1,"Royal Book of Horsemanship ,Jousting and Knightly Combat",I was looking for a more scholarly read . This is more of a children's book than a 15th century translation of jousting.
4,Works great,"I just bought this dryer a couple weeks ago, I really like it. It dries my hair quickly and it does not leave my hair frizzy.The only thing I would change is the on/off button. I hit that often causing it to shut off."
1,possible fire!,"I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one."
3,Andis,"It's okay, design of switches and location cause my wife and I both to shut the unit down while in use when moving it around and changing hands."
4,Just as I hoped!,"I used a similar product at a hotel in Boston. That night, I went online to purchase. Overall, I am very happy with its performance."
2,Poorly designed,"I used an Andis hairdryer at a hotel and loved it. Unfortunately, the model I used is no longer available, so I ordered this one. The design is poor. The switches for power/speed and air temp are directly on the handle (not recessed), so that I'm constantly inadvertently switching the unit off, or changing the air temp. Annoying!"
2,"Good blow dryer, but .....","the heat stopped working after a few months from buying it. I have long and thick hair, and the blow dryer dried my hair in 20 minutes ... smooth with no frizz. I loved it. I didn't even need to use the straightener. Before the Andis 1875, I was using a cheap blow dryer, and it lasted a lot longer than the Andis, and I washed my hair every other day. After I bought the Andis, I was washing my hair every 3rd day, and it crapped out on me after a few months. I would not recommend buying this blow dryer. :-("
4,Happy with my purchase,"I have very thick, very curly hair that is below my shoulders and this dryer works great. I diffuse my hair and my only complaint is that the nozzle on the dryer is a little big and is a tight fit for the largest connector to my Helen of Troy diffuser. It is a little heavy, but I don't hold the dryer above my head when I dry my hair...if I did, they weight of the dryer would probably be a little bothersome. The hot setting on the dryer gets really hot - which I like, and the cool shot button gets the dryer as cool as possible reasonably fast.After trying and returning other dryers, I'm happy with this one. It's not too expensive and it works great for me. I've only had it about a week, and some other reviews said it stopped working after a few months, so we'll see."
1,hand grip gets too hot,The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes. Not like toasty warm - HOT!It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.Don't bother.
4,Good hairdryer,This hair dryer works great. I did have a problem with the shipping though. It got lost in the mail and then arrived damaged. The new one is quiet and dries my hair quicker than my old one. My hair stylist says that this brand of hair dryers tend to take a while to warm up but I have not noticed this so far.
5,Great hair dryer,"I got this dryer for Christmas 2006. Last week, it stopped heating up and I needed to purchase a new one. I investigated dryers at Ulta and found that most decent ones were $100 or more. I figured I would check the price on this dryer on Amazon before I made a purchase. I was surprised to find that it was less than $40, because I assumed that it was a very expensive hair dryer.So that said, I am repurchasing the dryer. I think it lasted a long time given the cost, and it straightened my hair better than any other dryer I have ever used.If you blow dry your hair straight, this is a great model because it has the straightening attachment, is very hot at 1875 watts, has ceramic ions, and the price is right."
3,Powerful but hard to use,"This hair dryer has a very sleek design and has a lot of power. I love the nozzle attachments included with it and its long cord. However, I find this very hard to use because of the location of the power and heat switches. Since the dryer is somewhat heavy, a full grasp is required to use it. This placement and the required handling means I am constantly turning it off or switching heat settings mid use. It can be quite frustrating."
1,Didnt have luck with this one,"its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet"
2,"Works great for 4 months, and then dies!","I gave this hair dryer to my wife in mid-April for her birthday. She loved it. It got VERY hot and dried her hair in about 10 minutes, which was a whole 10 minutes less than any other dryer she had used. Everything was peachy until about a month ago (September) when all of a sudden it started making a terrible squeeling noise which required a bang on the counter to get working properly. The constant banging lasted for about a month and now it squeels and doesn't get hot anymore. All said and done, this is a great dryer if you only want it for 4 months, but for this kind of money I would have expected it to last a lot longer!"
3,Lasted 1.5 Years,"Hair dryer stopped working after about a year & a half of use. Worked great until one day, it stopped working altogther. Kind of expected to be able to use this for a longer period of time. Perhaps my expectations are too high?!"
1,very bad,"very cheap product, typical made in china product with a very bad quality. the color start to wears out after a few days"
5,best dryer ever,"This dryer is the best. I guess i've been stupid over many years, and not really was picky about dryers. This one is awesome. It dries fast and beautifully. My hair has never looked better."
5,I am happy with my blow dryer,"I have had this blow dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. I have A LOT of LONG very THICK hair, and it takes me about 6 minutes to completely blow dry my hair. Usually I blow dry my hair in about 3 different time fragments though. I get out of the shower; blow dry for 2-3 minutes, start applying my makeup, blow dry again for another 2-3 minutes until it is done.I never used the attachments; i ended up throwing them away a few days ago. I feel like it has good power. I like that you can have it on hot or warm air. You can also hold and press a cold button and it will blow cold air. The cold air button is easy to push (unlike most of my old blow dryers, your thumb would go numb after a few minutes). It looks classy, still after 6 months of use every day it looks new.I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to anyone. I paid $35.83 for it and would spend it again if needed."
2,The blower dryer get extremely hot.,The blower dryer gets extremely hot and damages your hair if used blow wet hair dry. My hair has broken off. My co-worker sets to blow her hair out. She accidently dropped the hot blow dryer between her legs. She has 3rd degree burns. She said her skin melted from the heat of the dryer. Imagine if the blow dryer touched her face and melted the skin off! I would not recommend this dryer.
2,"Loved it, but it died!","I got this dryer for Christmas last year, and I absolutley loved it! I didn't find it too heavy. It was quiet, and my hair felt great after drying it. Only thing I didn't care for was how hot the attachments got after using. Other than that I loved this hair dryer.But dang it, in October I took it with me to Tahoe for a wedding, and the dang thing just quit working. I was soooo dissappointed. I had to use those cheapo hair dryers that the hotels put in. I'm sorry but 9 months (maybe 3 days a week)of use and it dies!!!! What's up with that? If it had not died in such a critical moment, I would have given 5 stars."
4,Great for African American hair,I also have trouble finding tools and products for my hair. I have thick hair that is kinky in the back and wavy in the front. This blow dryer helps to elminate the use of my pressing comb. I just blow dry then flat iron now! I still get a nice soft pressed look!
4,can't beat it for the price,"I bought this hairdryer because the one I had died. It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years. I believe mine died because of a short in the cable, so I am choosing NOT to hang this one by the opening at the end of the base, even though it looks like it should be hung that way. This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast. I can dry my thick, curly (though short) hair in 5-10 minutes, and it does not get frizzy. I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting. It also is a standard size, so can take a diffuser without a problem-- I use it this way every day. I couldn't live without this dryer-- it dries my hair so fast without any damage. Also, I do not find it too heavy."
4,Andis 1875 Dryer,I really like the way this dryer smoothes the hair and it drys fast. The only downfall I've noticed is that the comb of the dryer is very fragile when it comes to some black hair textures.
2,They break and the manugacturer doens't help,This is the second Andis hair dryer I have had. The first was a gift and I loved it! So when it broke after 8 months of 3xs a week use I didn't mind buying myself a new one. Then this one lasted less than 4 months! Just up and stopped working mid drying one day - thank goodness I had a back-up! I tried calling and emailing the customer service for Andis repeatedly and have been completely ignored! I used to recommend this brand to everyone because the drying capabilities are amazing and the product feels sturdy - but now I would STEER CLEAR. My last conair was only $35 too and lasted for 8 years! I would rather go with something reliable than Andis!
2,Stopped working after 6 months,This blowdryer completley stopped functioning within 6 months of purchase. I have tried everything. I did love the blowdryer when it function. Not happy customer.
1,Andis 82005 1875 watts,"I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, & I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome & heavy & too large & the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.I am not a happy customer..."
4,i really enjoyed it!!!!,I really enjoyed this product. I have thick hair and overall it dried it quicker than any other blow dryer i ever had. i received it on time and just as shown in the picture thats how i got my product.
2,I would have said it was GREAT....except...,"This WAS a great hair dryer for a couple of months. I received the dryer in May and used it regularly for several months. In August I noticed that it just didn't feel hot any more. I pushed all the switches and button up and down, in and out several times to see if something was stuck but no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.I immediately contacted Andis via email and asked what I should do about the malfunctioning dryer but as of now, 3 weeks later, no response from Andis. Bummer!"
3,Dryer,"The dryer, which has a lot of power, does not seem to ever get hot. I prefer my blow dryers to be able to blow very hot air rather than just luke warm."
3,Not as quiet as I wanted,"This was a fine dryer, but I returned it. It simply wasn't as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers. The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings. That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it's much quieter than other dryers I tried."
1,heating element stopped working,"in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works. Only blow cold air. What a rip off, i have another ""professional"" dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong. DO not buy this one."
1,What junk,"I'm amazed that people described this product as ""heavy"". I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all."
2,Dud?,"When my inexpensive, but reliable blow dryer died after 4 years I purchased this one based on the number of positive reviews. But, as with any appliance, there's bound to be a dud here and there and I guess I got it.After only a couple of uses, it would make a muffled rattling noise and shut off. Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy. Not sure if I'll chance this particular one again though."
4,Works well - switches in inconvenient spot,"This hair dryer works fine. It has several settings that are good as well. The only problem that I see with the hairdryer is that the switches are located on the handle and as your hand wraps around to hold the dryer, you inadvertently shut it off. It's annoying but I feel as though it's just something I will get used to in time. Everything else about it is --- so far, so good."
4,Great while it lasted,"I was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer but it worked great. I have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight, with minimal frizz BUT it did die out exactly a year later. So I guess you get what you pay for....but it was good while it lasted."
2,Andis 82005 hair dryer,The dryer work really well...the only problem is when turn on it very loud...i mean very loud..if you have a thick hair and used it in a long period. it's can hurt your ear.
3,Clarity of display,"Atlas of Skeletal muscles is a basic book on anatomy which clearly illustrates each of the skeletal muscles in line drawing form. Bones to which the muscles attach are highlighted so you can clearly see point of origin and insertion. Small text section beneath or beside each illustration demonstrates Origin, Insertion, Action and connecting nerve.It's spiral binding allows the book to lay flat when needed for ease of study. A basic, beginner book for students of anatomy, and one which I would reccomend. It was a textbook of mine in Massage Therapy school."
4,very good,The item I bought was what I expected. The describtion I could read on amazon.com was complete in accordance with the reality.
4,A classis from VHS to DVD Going Home Jackson Browne,"Years ago I was maybe 15 years old and listened to Jackson like millions. His music combines a sweet coffee house beat with a righteous flare. Always has. I've ""burned this reoord"" in my memory. Praying that one of his final tours blesses millions for years to come.Good one.Melody"
4,Jackson Browne Going Home,"For all you die hard Jackson Browne fans out there, this DVD is a must have. It gives a good insight into his career and shows how well respected he is by others in music industry. I love his quirky friendship with David Lindley.The sound quality could be better!"
2,Going Home review,"I was very disapointed in this dvd. I wasn't aware it was a documentary,guess I should have looked at it closer than I did.There was way too much talking, not enough singing. Some of my favorite songs were just cut off in the middle of the song for more talking and interviews.Is there any way I can return it for a different dvd or am I just stuck with it?"
1,deceptive,This was sold in an American market and can only be played on European equipment. The seller would not take it back and Amazon could do nothing to intervene. Lesson learned about buyer be ware
3,Jackson Browne: Still Waiting,"Having been a fan of Jackson's since day one, I was anxious to receive my copy of this DVD. The melding of old performance to new performance was flawless. The sound quality was also superb. The song selection is everything that it should be. However,...... it was most disappointing that this is actually a documentary of the career of Jackson Browne.Maybe I should have read the details a little closer. Three quarters of the songs are interrupted by dialog, and never finished.If you want to see Jackson Browne in pure concert form, this DVD is not for you. Wait for, or demand a real concert video from the people who produce them.As a die hard J.B. fan, I'm still glad I own it, but I'll be waiting for something on the order of The Eagles' ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD."
2,hardely any live footage,"The best song is last,and before its 1/4 into the song they start rolling the credits and it just goes silent and black.expected more,got alot less for the money"
1,jackson browne going home region 2,"I was unaware what ""region 2 "" meant, and that I would not be able to view this dvd on my dvd player. So, I have purchased a product that is useless to me."
1,This Video Isn't Even Worth ONE Star...,"Because it isn't a concert video, but a retrspective of his career with little or no live concert coverage.Give me a break! Who gives a (bleep!) about his social or political positions! Just play the (bleeping) music!Pitiful. Really pitiful.If I could do it over again, I wouldn't."
2,Causes too much static.,I had an old scalpmaster that I loved but it was an older model they don't make any more. I bought this brush to replace it with but this brush causes a lot of static build up. I don't use this brush at all anymore and would not recommend this brush to my friends.
3,BOAR'S HEAD HAIRBRUSH,It's a great hairbrush for someone with medium length thin hair.. My hair is WAY too short (pixie cut) for this brush. The bristles are too close together and too soft and short to get UNDER the hair to brush and dry.It's nicely constructed. I am very disappointed that I can't use it.
1,Not Good For Short Hair,"The bristles on this brush are too close together and too soft to penetrate my hair. The scalpmaster brush I currently use is no longer made, unfortunately."
1,Exposure,"I thought I was getting a DVD of a movie called ""Exposure,"" about a photographer as portrayed by Peter Coyote. I thought the Coyote movie was excellent and really enjoyable, with great acting in some of the secondary roles. This DVD of a more recent movie named ""Exposure"" stars Ron Silver as a photographer. I thought this version was terrible and would not recommend it to anyone. The actors did a decent job, but plot was dull and predictable. A One Star rating is too high in my opinion."
5,Excellent resource book!!,This is one of the best breast cancer guides ever written. We give these to our newly diagnosed patients and they love them!!! Very well written and easy to understand w/o too much overwhelming detail!
4,Good overview,This is the book my sister's surgeon loaned her after the breast cancer diagnosis was made. It is presents information about the disease and treatment options in an easy-to-understand format.
2,color ?,"The color is strange... has a weird greenish fake patina look. Should be black or bronze, like it appears on line."
5,A riveting thriller in the true sense of the word!,"Thom Racina has written the most exciting thriller I have ever read. Maybe it is his soap opera background that made his writing of this book so compelling. I lived through this book like no other I read before or since. I thought in the beginning that if I knew ""whodunit"" up front, where would be the mystery, the intrigue? No need to worry about that! Racina made it easy for me to slip into Julia's role and feel what she felt. This really gave mixed feelings to her relationship with Matt, knowing what I knew but she didn't. The ending was a heart stopper - and perfect. His handling of Maggie's heroism showed his sensitivity to animals. I wish he would write more like Snow Angel."
2,stiff and painful,"The shoes are very beautiful, inthe moment you put them on your feet the start to hurt. The material is chap and stiff. I usually like CL choes, but these are not in my ""I like"" shoes"
1,Skip the movie,"The book was interesting and more complex. The movie was flat and lacked panache.If you have not read the book in print and have some time, get an AUDIO version of the book. Your mind will love Patchett's writing and will form its own vibrant pictures."
4,The Hobbit,Using this in a homeschool setting. It has appropriate lessons and ideas. The quizzes are good and really helps with knowing if the child is comprehending what he is reading.
5,Wonderful Addition to Book,This lit. unit is a fantastic teaching and learning tool. The quizzes help with discussion and reading comprehension while the activity suggestions make the learning process fun and more enjoyable. The vocabulary lists are an added bonus. Wonderful book!
1,Lyson Prem Luster is discontinued,"This paper product is a discontinued, and somewhat unstable material. This information is not readily available from the retailer. Expect fading and yellowing in fairly short order."
4,Certainly Missed the Quirky Ruby!,"This is certainly a different book in this series. For one thing there is no Ruby Wilcox, and I for one really missed her, as well as other eccentric citizens of Pecan Springs. It was interesting to look back at China's early life, and the mysitical theme was actually quite well done. This wasn't a mystery though in the true sense of the word. It's more a search for the past in China's mother's family. I still enjoyed the book, but I do want to get back to the main storyline in the next book in the series. We also see China getting softer and more feminine in each book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope she doesn't get too soft since her toughness is part of the appeal of this series."
4,Maybe the Best Thus Far?,"This is a departure for the series as China Bayles leaves Pecan Springs to go to her ancestral home, Jordan's Crossing in Mississippi, to help her mother with a problematic great-aunt. Most episodes have occurred in & around Pecan Springs. Great Aunt Tullie, about 85 years old, has Huntington's disease, a degenerative & inherited disease, that causes loss of control of muscles, speech, and emotions. There are other problems that have arisen in the years that China has been away - including a claim against the land, a man disappearing, and a mysterious old woman who seems to know more than anyone else about the family's history. I really enjoyed this entry into the series. It showed more depth into the development of characters and it was interesting to see the interaction between China and her semi-estranged mother, Leatha. Definitely worth reading and definitely worth looking forward to the next book."
3,Bloodroot,"It was fun to learn about China's ""roots'. Albert's character Ruby would have added to the story had she been present---lot's of supernatural stuff to explore."
3,Thread of Paranormal,"Interesting, informative and entertaining. A thriller mystery that brings the knowledge of a herbalist through it. Her knowledge of herbs for medicinal as well as homicidal uses while she searches for her heredity gives it a fascinating twist.A fast moving mystery taking place in a typical deep south small town with its deception and bigotry. A thread of the paranormal is ever present and adds to the intrigue to the many facets of the story."
2,Difficult to Read,"I have yet to miss a book in this series but I wished I did this one. The family history was confusing especially when the author kept referring to them differently -- one sentence a character might be referred to as Great-Great grandfather and the next it would be Leatha's grandfather. Also, I was confused as to a character that had a different name than what was on the family tree so I had no clue what was going on -- I did go back and re-read portions after I had read an except of a diary entry and the light went on but reading 120 pages for a light to blink... well, 'nuff said.Once I figured out who the characters all were, the plot was so obvious it hurt and to have to read China being braindead with her questions to figure out the truth was less than thrilling.Had I not had the prior history of this series, I would have never made it through this book.Let's hope the next one get's back to the roots of China (and McQuaid)."
1,PAINFUL to listen to,The reviewer that thought this album rocked must have had a massive coronary when he listened to Kix' other albums. Outside of 9-1-1 this album is garbage. It bears almost no resemblance to the terrific albums that came before it. If you're looking for an awesome rock band (I've always thought they would be a great opening act for AC/DC) you've found one but not on this record. Buy anything else from Kix and you'll be happy.
4,Just a pretty damn good rock record,"That is what it is. With one good ballad that features a cello solo. This is an interesting record because Kix knew going in that it may be thier last, and until now it is. They also knew it probably wasn't going to sell or see any airplay, and it didn't. All of this somehow turns out to be for the better. If track #3 (fireballs) every saw the light of day we'd all know that it is just AC/DC's Highway to Hell with different lyrics. Still a great song, but a rip-off. Other stand out tracks are Book of Hypnotize (best song on the disc) If you Run Around (the ballad), Baby Time Bomb, and She Loves Me Not. I don't like too much basic rock and roll, but these guys still bring it too the table here."
3,Solid enough,"While not a classic Kix album, this serves as a pretty decent swan song for the band's career. Some of the stuff ranks among their best, including the highly energetic ""Baby Time Bomb"" the fun midtempo ""Book to Hypnotice"" and the slow and sultry ""She Loves Me Not."" On the other hand, this album also includes some incredibly mediocre tunes such as the opener ""Ball Baby"" and the even more AC-DC ripoff than usual ""Fire Balls."" If you like Kix, you likely will like this album, but don't expect the consistency of ""Blow My Fuse"" or ""Hot Wire."""
4,Baby Time Bomb,"If You Run Around is a great ballad. Put My Money, 911, Baby Time Bomb, Hypnotize, and I'm Bombed all rock. A graet live band so purchase the Kix Live cd also"
2,The end of the line from this 80's hard rock band.,"I grew up with this band as one of my all-time favorites, and I was lucky enough to see them in person several times for some of the best on-stage performances I've ever seen. Each Kix album is distinctly different in sound, but even this die-hard fan has to admit their final effort misses the mark. 9-1-1 is probably the best song on the CD, and captures the sound of their previous efforts. The majority of the album is almost a dismal, tired attempt at something between blues and rock. Several tracks I can't stand to listen to. Yet you can still find a few things to like after repeated playing. I'd count Hotwire as the ultimate culmination of their efforts, and pass on this one unless you find it in the bargain bin :("
3,a snooze,"Although the book was highly recommended, I found it basic and patronizing. And I am personally averse to keeping logs and lists. This was not for me, alas."
2,Same info is on the web,"This books is so over-rated. I read all the reviews on this site and ran out to get the book only to find that this so-called six-week plan is just 6 chapters of stuff you can find on the web. The author introduces very few new insights into the discussion. Some of his weaker suggestions are to simply think positively or not overreact to sleeping poorly. He has a chapter about cognitive therapy that is an abbreviated explanation of a topic covered expertly in ""Feeling Good"". He claims that all sleep medications are bad and then does admit that drugs such as ambien are much better than older drugs. Don't buy this book. I got more info from [...]."
2,How to be redundant in 200 pages,"Read the reviews carefully on this and other books on this topic.Just because a book covers the needed material, does not automatically mean the book is well written.I am not one who has the patience to wade through 200 pages of material that could easily be laid out in 10 pages.I'd be more prone to call the author a marketing specialist, than a sleep specialist.With the product advertised.......hearing himself say the same thing 2000 times.The basic information for managing insomnia may very well be contained within this book.However the ""find the needle in the haystack"" process, was just too frustrating for me."
5,The best book on insomnia I've come across,"This book was recommended to me by a woman who specializes in all the aspects of sleep disorders. Just buying the book actually helped me to sleep better! Jacobs' common sense, holistic approach made a lot of sense to me, and I have basically been sleeping soundly since I got it, after 3+ years of insomnia. The suggestion of morning exposure to natural light and morning exercise has been revolutionary to me. Maybe that is obvious folk wisdom, but it took a Harvard Med School doctor to write a book about it! I have never written an Amazon review before, and hyperbole doesn't come naturally, but this book changed my life."
4,Sleep Program Works,"This book is very repetitive; I assume because it has been edited and released several times since it was first written. It does take some ""plowing"" to get through all the redundant material, but the overall concept does work. My sleep apnea doctor suggested this book, saying that the author's work demonstrated the best overall understanding of sleep issues and that he had developed the best program for the treatment of insomnia. I know that I am sleeping much better since I started using the techniques he suggests in the book. While I didn't fill out all his charts, I still had success using the plan he suggests. If you buy this book, just be prepared for a less than dynamic writer. He may put you to sleep! But that is the goal."
5,Self Help at it's best,"I'm a physician and I have recommended this book and given it as a gift. It helped my own daughter. As a nation we are sleep deprived and for the subset of people who find it hard to fall asleep a natural method to deal with this problem is preferable to a drug solution with all it's side effects. If insomnia is your problem, this is the first stop to improved sleep."
2,not to good,My mom wanted this book so I got it she told me the only thing good about it if you read it it might bore you to sleep
4,counselling for insomnia,"Although a self-help book, I find it an excellent resource to use in my counselling/psychotherapy practice. It is based on a wide range of research and the author's extensive experience in using the techniques givenGeorge Seber,Emeritus Prof of Statistics, Auckland University, NZPhD, FRSNZ, Dip Counsel, NZCCA"
4,This is going to save your life,I never thought a self help book could really make a difference but this book did to my life. To everybody suffering from insomnia: there is help and the answer lies in this book. There could be more emphasis on meditation perhaps with a step by step guide to help keep you practicing. But overall this book is really going to help you.
4,A good book for overcoming sleep problems,"The author provides a step by step plan for overcoming insomnia, provides worksheets to log sleep time and sleep quality, and the information he provides helps to quell the anxiety that starts to surround the sleep process when insomnia occurs. This book helped me to get through the struggles of quitting sleep medications and learn what my healthy amount of sleep is so I stopped stressing out if I didn't get the full 8 hours that so many people think we need."
2,"30% self promotion, 30% folksy talk, 30% okay","I took this book back. A book that spends as much time as this one telling you how good it (and the author) is turns me off. It presents research findings as though they are rumors, with no mention of the source. There's not even an index to look up topics. There are very much better books on this topic. The factually best is by William Dement -- the founder of the field of sleep medicine (""The Promise of Sleep""). A more accessible one is by Hairi & Linde, ""No More Sleepless Nights."""
5,A life saver,"I bought this book out of desperation. It seems that one day I suddenly lost ability to fall asleep. After several weeks spent virtually without sleep, I went to a doctor and got sleep medication, which worked well. However, I was unable to sleep without it and my husband and I wanted to have a second baby. Thus, I knew I would have to get off the medication; but when I tried to sleep without the pill, I couldn't fall asleep.Thank you to all the readers who have recommended this book and helped me choose the right one! As a result of following Dr. Jacobs' advice, I no longer need any medications and have no sleep-related problems. This was a great investment!This book can be helpful to anyone who would like to improve quality (or quantity) of his or her sleep."
4,When you have exhausted all other insomnia cures...,"I struggled with insomnia for more than 10 years. I rarely got more than 3-4 hours sleep per night. I had tried all the suggested remedies -- yoga, sleeping pills (Ambien), mild anti-depressants, etc... Nothing helped. Then I decided that enough was enough. I made sure there were no physical causes for my insomnia (such as sleep apnea) and then I got to work. I found Dr. Jacobs' book at my local library. The idea of a drug-free program appealed to me. Yes, some of his ideas may sound simple but simple has worked for me. I'm not saying I sleep eight hours a night every night but my sleep has definitely improved. I feel human again! If you are ready for help and are willing to follow the book's advice, you will see improvement. If you are like most people who want a magic pill for insomnia -- you won't find it here. Once you are ready to put in some effort, give the book a try. Attitude is everything!"
2,Not as good,"I felt this book was condescending. I didn't find the logs helpful in this format. The tone was very pompous and self congratulatory. I had better results using the book ""No More Sleepless Night."""
5,This really helps!!,"I've tried everything I could think of to escape my insomnia for over 2 years now including pills, alcohol, herbs, etc... I thought I'd never be able to overcome this! However, I saw this book (along with 4 others) at the library, and I was willing to try almost anything. This book was the most helpful to me! I've been working with the techniques in this book for three weeks now, and my sleep has definitely improved. It may not cure you immediately, but it really helps!! Anyway, this is certainly better than spending a lot of money (and aggrivation) on pills and sleep centers!"
2,Some helpful info,"This book does have some helpful information about the human body's sleep cycle as well as the effects of medication and other treatments for insomnia. However, the book is written in a simplistic manner pandering to the uneducated and the uninformed. I guess I understand the doctor's approach in ""dumbing down"" the topic: if the writing had been too technical or ""difficult,"" he would have lost a large number of potential buyers. Nevertheless, depsite the annoyingly simplistic style of the book, I carefully followed the six-week program, and unfortunately ended up sleeping worse than when I started!"
5,John Ciardi's children's poems are delicious,"I have owned this book since I was a child, and I love it now as much as I did then. These warm, charming, funny poems are wonderful to read with a child on your lap -- or to say to your favorite little ones at moments throughout the day. Children's poetry was never this good before or since."
5,A great selection of Beach & Boogie songs,"Anyone who enjoys Beach & Boogie Music has to add this selection to their library. I've been going to Myrtle Beach for about 20 Years and this music brings me back there ""in mind"" week after week. A great quality CD. Just wish I could find individual cd's from the various artists on this one.Thanks for the MemoriesBill Pesavento, Mountaintop Pa"
2,Amazon policy misleading,"This phone will not reliably connect to any Wi-Fi hotspots, and the ActiveSynch program renders my computer unusable. Beware of the Amazon ""return"" policy. It is return only, and if you get a family plan, it is return both phones only, you cannot exchange, and their customer service is very poor."
1,Nightmarish,six hours trying to set up active sync. $35.00 to microsoft tmobile no help have been a tmobile pocket pc user for five years would not recommend this unit until either tmobile of microsoft work better together.
1,Horrible phone,"I LOVE motorola phones & was skeptical trying one from T-mobile (with good reason, I found out the hard way). The keyboard keys are not prominent enough & not spaced out enough to make for easy use. I hated having to use the stylus for most programs. I basically wanted a phone w/ a keyboard. I suppose it may be great if you're using it as a pda, but it still sucks. I sent it back."
1,Horrible Phone : Lack many features that should be standard,"I got this cool looking phone last week. I suppose ""cool looks"" is all this phone is all about. Its so NOT user friendly. Just to be able to add a contact it becomes a pain. When I am dialing 1800 numbers the subsequent (press-1 , press-2) type thing is so incovenient.DONT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!"
2,This is incredible,"I love this phone. I use it to text-message my friends, to play countless video games, to keep track of my appointments, to download all the hottest ringtones, videos and music, I use the calculator function to accurately price each ""transaction""... I fond that the seventy five thousand functions of this phone are a perfect substitute for...... (wait for it)A SIMPLE POS THAT YOU PUT NEXT TO YOUR HEAD A TALK TO SOMEONE WITH!!Fifty years ago, andy griffith could pick up the reciever adn say ""mable,... get me aunt Bee..."".... and with all the technology we have today, the reception just gets worse each year as companies turn phones into everything but a phone.."
2,Stay away from this device,"Its cool, but right now a lot of the software out there will not work and will send your unit into an endless reset loop.take a year and buy this. not now though. i would recommend it. the firmware is terrible."
3,Not bad for a smartphone....,"Not the best out there, but better than most. Negative reviewers, what were you expecting? It's a good phone. My only complaint is the weak signal, but the WiFi connectivity more than makes up for it. For those who are having trouble synching, you should put Windows XP Service Pack 2 on your PC first. Then you should have no problem."
2,Not a very good product,"I just sold my MDA a week ago after using it for 2 months. The product is very underpowered. At 195 mhz, this machine is a dog and you are constantly waiting for it to respond. It is like trying to run Windows XP on a 486. That really is my only complaint. It has many nice features, but they just cannot be fully apreciated since the processor is so slow! The camera isnt all that much to write home about either..."
1,"Great PDA, Bad Phone","To make this short and to the point. I owned two MDA's over the two week trial period. I loved the phone and thought the internet and applications were easy to use. I killed the battery very quickly but that was probably because I spent too much time on the internet.Bottom line is the sound quality is awful. Most people I spoke with told me I sounded like I was talking through a tin can or I sounded very distant. I hoped that maybe I just received a bad phone, so I returned it for another. Same story.......the worst sounding phone I've owned in 10 years. I was sad to have to return it, but if you want a good phone for talking this is not it..........."
4,(:D),"I like my phone i got it the first day it came out and when i got it i mean it takes some getting use to but I like the features, the camera, the phone is ok not wow, love the keyboard, and i really like my windows media player on it and all the things you can do. I don't know what most people were expecting but i think my expection of the phone is what i expected....Until someone finds the perfect phone that has no problems, have everything you ever wanted, absolutely no issue with it and it does every possible thing, then you let me know but for now this phone is ok/good"
3,Very bad battery,"Battery life is VERY poor, with regular usage I need to charge it in the middle of the day or it runs out completely. If used as a phone only, it could last a little more.Besides the quality of battery and overall this MDA is just okay."
3,Why do you need to buy the Internet Package?,"It makes no sense to purchase the internet package if you're going to be in a wifi area, does it? It seems to be a waste of $30 a month if you already have wireless where you work..."
2,It would be great if it worked consistently,"When I got the phone, I set up all the email prefs, added my phone numbers and tried wireless internet surfing. At first I loved the phone - I had such flexibility to send/receive email and was never out of touch. Very handy!!Then a few weeks later things started happening to it. Without any changes, the email settings were just lost. I was without email access for several days until I had time to take a look at it and discovered that the incoming and outgoing mail servers were wrong. My password was wrong as well.Now I'm getting screen freezes as well. It's not a dependable device - I can set everything up properly (over and over again) and then a few days later it's like I never set it up at all.I don't recommend this product, in fact I'm going to try to return it and replace it with something on which I can depend."
3,Warning,"I bought the MDA to replace my aging and worn Sidekick II about 2 months ago.- On the upside, the device is quite feature-rich. The camera works (albeit not amazingly well), the wifi is fast, the battery life is reasonable, the display is nice, and the processor is adequate.However,- Instant messaging is unreliable, with the network eating IMs for up to several hours at a time, often in the middle of a conversation.- IMs are not considered internet service, but rather text messages... At $.10 each (sending and receiving), this adds up VERY quickly- I wasn't aware of this ""feature"" when I started using the device and wound up with $90 in additional fees within a month of getting the device. I got this refunded, but only by signing up for unlimited text messages.The device is nice, relatively robust, and fun, but it is by no means the convergence device I'd hoped for... But it'll do for the next couple of years. >.<"
1,Watch out - Hidden monthly fees,Watch out potential buyers. Amazon automatically signs you up for an additional $29.99/month internet fee with a contract!It is bad service by Amazon to not reveal this charge until check out. I bet alot of people miss it and then have a surprise charge they can't get out.
2,"Very Poor Phone, Good PDA",I returned this phone because it has very poor phone capabilities.Dialing the number on screen is very difficult. Cannot use in car.WIFI and bluetooth features are good. MS word and MS Excel excel applications are good.
5,Fabulous smartphone,"I've had my MDA for over a year and couldn't be happier with it. Keeps all my work appointments, synchronizes with my work computer for files, contacts, etc. I have GPRS or wireless internet wherever I go. It's a little too heavy, but otherwise a great product. Long battery life too."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!,"I bought my first MDA about a year and a half ago. I was excited to have it at first just because it was my first smartphone. Then, I quickly realized that this phone was not all I thought it was cracked up to be. The design is poor and not very well thought out. The phone is awkward. It is a huge clunky hot mess. I had all of the same problems with the touch screen, stylus, battery, and reception that all of the oher reviewers had. I finally got fed up with this phone a few weeks ago when it wouldn't hold a charge for a whole day, even on standby. I bought 2 new batteries and none of them would hold a charge. Apparently, the MDA was sucking the life out of them. Rather than using the insurance for the 3rd time to get another MDA, I ended up getting a Blackberry Pearl. It is so much better than the MDA. Since T-Mobile customers cannot get the iPhone, the Blackberry Pearl is the next best thing. Check it out instead and avoid this phone like the plague."
2,Get rid of that Styllus pen,"Great interface, but the pen is faulty. I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use. The pen for the mda doesn't work sometimes and it's operation isn't smooth. The screen isn't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs, that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it, for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all."
3,Touch Screen develops dead spots...,"I bought my MDA 8 months ago and immediately used protector sheets on the screen, bought the nice holder for it...in short took care of it. It recently started acting up and developing a dead spot right in the middle of the touch screen (you can see, but you can't select things in the dead spot). The biggest thing is not being able to change the times for appointments, since you can only do it in its small window that sits under the same blind spot. Luckily, I'm using the one year warranty and returning it to T-mobile in exchange for another one.Another headache that I'm having is that the small USB port on the bottom works on and off now, so I purchased a Bluetooth adaptor for the computer to do the sync...well, I had it configured, but you have to spend hours of research trying to do it...then it stopped syncing and now I have to spend hours again, that's not the MDa's fault...it's Activesync's and Bill gates though!"
1,Worst equipment ever.,"Unless you want to have a pocket PC you can use this one. However the phone itself may be considered as a mediocre phone. Even the cheepest phone you can get for free from your provider may work better.Pros:- Windows 5.0 (the latest version)Cons:- Constantly loses connection comparing to other phones at the same conditions (RAZR, Blackberry)- Dialing using a touch screen is a nightmare. Try to listen what's going on and use a stylus at the same time :)If you want a pocket PC you may want to buy just a pocket PC with no phone attached."
1,"So far, it bites!","I've had this device for about a day or so, and it really bites the big one! I switched from the sidekick II, and it is so much easier and convenient than this thing! It's slow, it freezes up, and it doesn't even come with email. You have to set up your own account. Of course, t-mobile will tell you how this is so much better than the sidekick or blackberry, it is not! I will fiddle with it for a couple more days, but I think I will send it back. Looks pretty slick, but it is definitely all glitter and no gold."
2,disaster if you have a mac,"they never mention that this is not Mac compatible, they refer you to a 3rd party provider that sells a patch for $40 that does not yet support the mda's operating system. the screen touch pad is not responsive, wrong responses come up all the time and you dial the wrong person's #. the manual is not clear. the alarms do not go off on time but all at once, hours later at the end of the day. not intuitive at ALL. I had a palm treo 600, notoriously lousy but better in many respects than this. Steer clear!"
5,WOW,Just a wonderful DVD. A very grand movie that kept me fascinated. I've watched it 3 times in a week and am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Have you ever been astonished for three hours?,"This film is literally so great that absolutely no film in its fantasy genre deserves to stand up for comparison. George Lucas might as well retire right now -- his Star Wars work (as good as it sometimes has been) would not be qualified to stand as a footnote to this staggering production! The depiction of Middle Earth is so convincing that we feel completely immersed in the illusion. The effects are so consistently seamless that I usually had no idea where the digitalization began and ended! And the details of the various depictions draw the viewer inexorably into the scenes. The screenwriting is so finely tuned that we quickly find ourselves caring simultaneously about a great number of characters. Ian McKellan, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette, and various others are magnificent. This is the most creative production I have ever seen! Little wonder it has so far been the big winner of 2001 -- it is clearly Best Picture."
5,awsome movie!!,"this movie was an awesome experience, in fact i liked it so muchi saw it three times and am going to see it again with my sis.,melissa Goodman, she is 8. I have read the book and think that they did a fantastic job in making the characters come to life.the movie made me want to read the book... so I did,even my little sis. is done w/it."
5,"Not ideal, but about as good as it's possible to make","This movie could never be ideal, no matter how great it might be, because there is the book to compare it with. You cannot beat Tolkien at his own game.However, I believe that this is about as close as it's possible to get. It's clear that the actor's have been chosen carefully (there is not one I feel doesn't fit his role). The SPIRIT is there; Tolkien wrote about noble and brave people (and other beings), which is exactly what we see in the film. What seemed to me a special treat was the episode in Moria (which was one of my favourite bits in the book as well) when after one of the hobbits drops the stone there is a silence and then the sound of drums. Of course, it's nowhere as good as in the book, but overall well dealt-with.This movie is excellent. It doesn't do justice to the book, naturally, but... what movie could?"
5,Fantasy at its best!,"Before I saw this movie, I thought that it was for a certain type of people. You know, the one's that were in some medieval club in high school and in college. Surprise! I'm a girl who is completely loyal to the whole Jane Austen genre, and I absolutely loved the film. The cinematography is stunning and will leave you with the desire to drop everything and move to New Zealand. Just like Star Wars, it's got the good and the bad side, and all the interesting different creatures, a gorgeous girl, some great looking guys, sure Legolas is a little feminine, and great music too! It follows the book very carefully, and in someways, it improves the story. It's entertaining, frightening, cheesy, romantic, and just about every other adjective you could think of.If this movie doesn't seem like your ""cup of tea"", then all the more reason you should try it and broaden your horizons . . . like me, you just might be surprised!"
4,"Good, Very good.","*This review is for the theatrical version*I am a big Lord of The Rings fan. And I think the movie was great. The acting was good, the costumes and props were well made with great attention to detail, and unlike other movies, the hordes of badguys are not all CG. Although, there are a few things I hoped would be in the movie from the book that are not. Examples: Tom Bombadil is missing, some dialogue between Gandalf and Saruman was changed, and there are other small things changed or taken out in the transformation from book to movie. Although if the movie were exactly like the book, it would be long enough to warrant an intermission. Still, it was a very good movie overall. I suppose 4.5 stars would be a more accurate reflection of my opinion, but I apparently can't do that. From what I hear, the DVD is going to have more footage, so I might not be disappointed after all. Good movie."
5,"!!!Warning!!! Problems for some PC's, too!","Although Interactual is not stating specifically why it's happening, they acknowledge compatibility problems with this release and certain DVD-ROM's. Why would these same players have no trouble with other DVD's??? Why, that's a riddle for Gollum or Bilbo, but apparently not Interactual's tech support!!! Currently, they're laying the blame on hardware/technology that is less than one year old!...Quite frustrating for those whose computer serves as DVD!!! playback!"
4,A movie about a totally different world,"This movie is one of the best movies ever. The graphics are good, the story plot is good, the acting was also good. Unfortunelty the ending was a little disappointing. I cant wait for the 2nd part to come out on dvd. I definetly recommend this dvd for those who like movies about magic and wizards."
5,I feel ripped off,"I pre-ordered the Fellowship DVD. I love it. But I will not pre-order the next one. If they are going to let early adopters get an inferior version of the DVD, then I will not be an early adopter. Two Towers? I want it, but I won't order it until I know that the extended version is available. Perhaps not until the boxed set that has the complete extended collection has been released. Or the extended extended version...."
1,Widescreen please!,"The movie is a five star, no doubt about that. But why is the first release of the VHS in full screen only? I don't want to wait until November for a two tape extended version which will be widescreen. If the DVD can be widescreen, why can't the VHS. It is very disappointing to me. Widescreen is the best way to view any movie."
1,"1 star if you own the extended version, 5 stars if you just want the movies","I, like a lot of others was kind of annoyed when I saw another issue out. I own the extended and theatrical releases already. BUT, I had to buy them to see the ""Never before behind the scenes documentary"". To be honest, I wasn't impressed. A few funny things, but all in all...I could have lived without it. It's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason. The Extended version extra material is so far superior. That's my opinion.But like me, you may just have to have it! Shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us!If you don't own the movies and are generally not into the extras, this is definitely a good way to go, You get both versions and in a very smart package."
1,got 2 of the same disk,"I bought this some time ago, but decided to watch it before the hobbit came out. Well, I got both of the interview disks, but two of the last half of the movie disks, so totally useless. Don't buy, unless you want to take a chance on getting half of the movie."
5,Excellent Adaptation of a Timeless Masterpiece,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was amazed at how well the screenplay flowed. There is no dead space in the entire movie. The only negative was the dramatization of Liv Tyler and her character, but I guess they would not release it without having some ""chic"" in the movie. True, the movie leaves out a lot of events from the book, but I beleive that no one would or could ever make a movie long enough to tell the whole story. Everone should see this movie and own this DVD."
5,LOTR Rox My Sox,"I have only one thing to say about this movie - it's the best one I've seen in my life. Yeah, the DVD's not out yet, but it can only be better than the theatrical version, and that was undoubtedly the best [money] I've ever spent. BUY IT!..."
5,The GREATEST MOVIE EVER,This is the best movie I have ever seen and will probably ever see. It is incredible - better then I expected and worth the three tortous years of waiting and listening to rumours. I plan on seeing is again and again and again. It was beyond description wonderful. Jackson was so loyal to the book there were scenes almost word for word from the book. And the acting was wonderful. Gandalf was soooo great. The Hobbits were so great! Everyone was great!I CANT WAIT UNTIL PART 2!!!
1,Product Did Not Match Description,"Ordered Blu-Ray with DVD combo pack. Got Blu-Ray only. Seller did not respond when contacted. I opened a case with Amazon who refunded my purchase. Would not recommend this particular seller. However, Amazon made good on the problem. Will continue to buy from Amazon."
5,amazing,"It is obviously not as good as the book, but, (when not compared to the book) it is one of the greatest films ever made.Trust me: Arwen's part is not as big as it is made out to be. Probably the smallest part in the movie."
5,THIS MOVIE IS A TRUE LEGEND FOR MY GENERATION!,"Incredible image, sound (great job DTS). I watch this movie every weekend waiting for january 2, the premier of The Two Towers en my city. AMAZING, THE BEST PICTURE OF 2001, 2002 AND 2003."
3,Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring,"I watched this movie when it was first released on DVD or VHS. Can't remember which. It was quite long and a bit boring. Just when things were getting good - it ended. It was mostly just the setting for the next two movies of the series. I have both of the other two and bought this one to complete the series. Also, it's been so long since I saw this one that I have to re-watch it so I won't be lost watching the other two, which got great reviews.Even though this one was not great, I knew from what I saw that I wanted to see how it would end."
5,excellent!,"I own the theatrical version but can't help but buying this one too! the sound is amazing, for the same amount of volume set compared to other movie... the sound in this movie actually shake my whole living room. and the picture is really really beautiful. Plus additional footages and all the extras, this set will keep you busy for a long while. a must have!"
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","What a crime. This is probably the worst transfer of a movie to DVD in that last two years. And for a movie of this magnitude it is a crime!.I realize that the 'real deal' is going to come out in November...This one is terrible! The colors are bad, the encoding is blurry and full of artifacts and the sound is imbalanced, uneven and just plain bad. I was really looking foward to this dvd and had high expectations. What a disappointment. I'm not sure whether this LOTR is better than no LOTR."
1,RELEASE THE EXTENDED CUTS PLEASE......,I am so tired of seeing mediocre releases of movies. Why can't the Company release the Extended (and much better) versions of these films on Blu Ray?? What is the hold up? I will not buy another version of these films. Period.Stop wasting my time and release the ones that the rest of the public want.
5,Lord Of The Rings kicks Harry Potter's butt!!!!!!!,This film was fantastic it was always exciting and there was always something happening all the time. The effects were fabulous and the creatures in the movie were well created. Even though the film was 3 hours long it diddn't bore me- because i thought at first i was going to get bored sitting for 3 hours watching this film but it did not bore me at all because there was always something new happening and i thouroughly enjoyed the film.This film is loads better than Harry Potter because Harry Potter is mainly a kids film as this one is for kids and adults. I can't wait for the next one to come which is 'The Two Towers' in christmas 2002 so untill the next one comes out i am going to buy the second book called 'The Two Towers' and read it to find out what happens because the suspence is killing me!
2,I can't relate to fantasty creatures. Well done but boring.,"I don?t like fantasy. However, I?m a big movie buff. This trilogy has been a big box office success. And people whose opinion I trust have recommended that I see it.Well, the day finally came. And as I put this 3-hour epic into my DVD I was prepared to have an open mind.Yes, there were good special effects. And yes, the actors seemed adequate. But I hated the story. And, if it was supposed to be symbolic, it got lost on me.I just can?t relate to fantasy creatures. I don?t care about their problems. All I could do was look at the clock. Well, I lasted for 113 minutes. And I hated every one of those minutes.This is not a film for me. And I can?t recommend it."
1,Disappointed With What They Didn't Tell you,"Because I love Tolkien's LOTR and the initial FOTR release, I eagerly placed the disk in the DVD drive of my 11-month old Compaq Presario. It whirred three times and ejected the disk. After checking out websites and Compaq tech support, I learned that this DVD is so ''advanced'' that many DVDs' firmware can't read it. Don't buy this disk unless you check on the Interactual website for conflicts...."
2,The Lord of the Rings - Extended Version Platinum Edition,I have been waiting anxiously for the extended version release. When I saw it at the theater I thought it was the movie of the decade. The movie held true to my imagination and the scenery in the film was astonishing.When viewing the newly released extended version I was truely disappointed. The widescreen extended version released in both CD and VHS format aspect ratio is done at 2:35:1; the smallest widescreen compression currently made. The viewable portion lost is about one half. To watch such a beautiful scenic movie even on our 50 inch big screen televsion was terrible. I cound only imagine what it would look like on a regular televison set.
3,Over-hyped,"A bunch of shortarses walk a bit, fight a bit, hide a bit, do a bit of magic, fight a bit more, then walk down a hill...the end. I'm sorry but it just doesn't hack it as a standalone film. Pap, albeit well made pap"
1,"incredibly long, incredibly boring","""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was one of the longest and most tedious movies I've ever seen. I sat for three hours in a theater chair watching the most weird-looking creatures battling a bunch of other guys over and over. The Orcs, or whatever you call them, are really disgusting. There were too many names that got confusing. There was Aragorn, Sauron, Saurumon, Gondor, and half a million other names and places that got confusing. What a waste of three hours."
1,The Movie is still Split accross 2 Blu-Rays :(,Damn they did it again they stil split the movie onto 2 discs this is really annoying to have to get up and change the disc in my Blu-Ray player. They freaking used BD50GB discs again instead of using BDXL100's All this really is a re-release of the same extended Blu-Ray again but with Ultra Violet Digital Copy instead of iTunes Digital Copy. I'll wait for the combined Hobbit Trilogy and LotR Trilogy Blu-Ray boxed set that will hopefully use BDXL100 discs that I wont have to put in a scecond disc half way through the movie.
2,Lord of The Rings - Extended Version,ASIN B000067DNFI have been waiting anxiously for the extended version release. When I saw it at the theater I thought it was the movie of the decade. The movie held true to my imagination and the scenery in the film was astonishing.When viewing the newly released extended version I was truely disappointed. The widescreen extended version released in both CD and VHS format aspect ratio is done at 2:35:1; the smallest widescreen compression currently made. The viewable portion lost is about one half.

5,Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"There is not much I can add to everything that has already been said about this DVD. We purchased the extended version which includes 30 extra minutes which were deleted from the cinematic version. We watched the movie, then viewed all the extra commentaries and the extra 2 discs which covered every aspect of making the movie including the computer graphics, the locations in New Zealand, and the music and sounds just to name a few. The thing that has impressed me most is Peter Jackson's vision and the incredible job he did in bringing in all the right people to make this the masterpeice that it is. If you are a huge fan of ""The Lord of the Rings"", the extended DVD is the only way to go."
5,Best movie ever!,"The Lord of the Rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting, fantastical scenery, and thrilling plot twists. Peter Jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single Oscar they got. The movies are a wonderful tribute to the books. Fortunately, they've been made so well that they can be enjoyed by all, from the Tolkien aficionado to kids who haven't yet read the books.Fellowship of the Rings has always been my favorite of the movies. I love how it dwells in the history of Middle Earth. The color filters used to set the moods are techniques still underutilized by cinema."
5,Good Stuff,"I orderd this as a replacement for one that my friend ""borrowed"" and never returned to me before I moved. I am happy with the transaction, the only difference that I noticed between my previous copy and the one that I ordered was with the exterior case/box. The design is slightly different, it makes the case look like a well loved/read leather bound book a little tattered, but this had no effect on the DVD's playback."
3,"Once again, huh? What's the point in this?","No new material? Just release a new box every now and then. That's basically what this ""new"" set seems like to me. I can't picture any serious collector not having the extended editions already on DVD, and/or waiting for the HD version."
5,FANTASTIC!,"definitely recommend this to any fan of the trilogy. The movies are perfect and it's convenient to have everything on one disc, including both the theatrical and extended versions. The special features is sure to not disappoint, there's plenty of inside action and cute points in which the actors get up close and personal about working in the set. It's definitely worth it, I recommend it to anyone!Overall: A++++++"
1,OH MY GOD !...,"Ok first of all the lead character isn't a great actor, and the movie made him worse. his two friends are the ones always causing the problems, the wizard was the best actor and he died. TERRIBLE MOVIE sorry just my opinion."
2,kind of dumb,"I had heard the rave reviews for this movie and I must say I was quite disappointed. The movie was way too long and was fairly boring. The ending was really stupid and just kind of stopped in the middle of nowhere, which was basically an introdution to the second in series. What a bunch of weird, unbelievable characters in this movie as well. No chance I'll be watching the next two in the series. Would not want to waste my time."
1,"Overrated, boring, and inferior to the book","Just a lot of violence, ridiculous and excessive CGI, and frantic pacing in order to pack in plot details from the book. I left before the movie ended as did many others in the theatre. I will not be looking forward to the next installment of this series. I plan on reading the trilogy again sometime soon in order to erase the poor effect this movie had on me. If you like the book for what it really was, you won't enjoy this sub-par action flick."
1,u must think im crazy,im not into this fairytale frodo fairy stuff so i dont like it. maybe it'd be easier to watch if it was shorter. it seemed to drag on and on especially in the 2nd film
4,"Long, Drawn-Out and did I mention that it's LONG!!!!!!!!!","I was eagerly awaiting this movie and when I finally got an advanced copy of it and saw that it was 3 discs I knew I was in for a long movie. Don't get me wrong the movie itself is good but it could have been shorter (like let's try 2 hours exactly!). The movie is just like the book, but let me just say that the movie itself just gets to the point and doesn't give us the over-long intro the book has. I own the 1978 animated movie which with a running-time of 134 minutes contains both ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"", WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE DONE THAT! Oh well, the movie is good, but make sure you pee before you watch it."
1,Childish claptrap for the Star Wars crowd,"I can't believe I wasted three hours on an orgy of childish, quasi-mystical good-vs-evil claptrap, only to have this poor excuse for a movie end with a cynical cliff-hanger designed to lure everyone back into the theater for the sequel. An embarrasment for otherwise fine actors like Holm and McKellen."
1,waste of time,"Lord of the Rings was a TERRIBLE movie. It was waaay too long, and a complete waste of money...and time! Some long movies are ok because they have a fast pace, which was clearly not the case with this one. There is no way I'm seeing it again or any of the other two. :("
2,"Liked the elves, hated the rest. Stupid.","Bored. Bored by the books, too, but the movie got such great reviews I thought the visuals would be worth it. I like fantasy and adventure epics generally so I can only speculate as to why I'm in the severe minority on this one.Briefly, it may be a guy thing. The redundant battle scenes particularly. How many times am I expected to see Frodo almost killed and Our Heroes fight off a zillion attackers in one movie? Particularly, the death scene at the end was like watching some kind of bad soldier porn.As a female I appreciate Hollywood's attempt to put some attractive males in here. At least my attention is not expected to be held by ugly, short, kind of slow, nasty hobbits like in the novels in which they seem to do nothing but eat elf crackers at regular intervals for 1500 pgs.Classic. Masterpiece. With so many long positive review there has to be a point. All I can say is :Whatever."
3,Feelasleep of the Ring,There was no bigger fan of the books back in the 70's than me. My wife bought the DVD against my recommendation. I had seen some of the scenes at HT demo's and knew it to be pretty violent in spots. To her credit she sat through the whole thing and demanded that we either buy or rent the Two Towers ASAP! Well I know I fell asleep at least once during this multi-hour epic bore. Thankfully it wasn't during the only action sequence in the entire movie. This movie could have been edited down to an hour and been much more enjoyable. It is a commentary on our times when folks think this is great movie making. The Two Towers is no better. Snore!
4,"Great film, but...","I was extremely pleased with this treatment of the classic text. However, if you're enough of a fan of the film to go out and buy it, why not wait until November to get the special release with 30 extra minutes?"
5,Its the Star Wars of the new Melnium,"Lord of the Rings is the second best Triolgy next to Star Wars. I am not disrespecting Lord of the Rings by any means, I just grew up on Star Wars. On to the movie Christopher Lee did a great job as Sarmon the White wizard Elijah Wood also did a great job as Froto. Ian Magluin was great as Gandolf sorry if I spelt his name wrong. The Fellowship has the perfect formula same with the Two Towers and Return of the King. I am definity going to be in the theater god willing for the next 2 movies in the Lord of the Rings Series"
3,seriously overrated,"I read the books when I was a kid and loved them, so I saw the movies everyone seems to be so crazy about. They were okay, but they put me in mind of Tolkien's world as imagined by people who play lots of Dungeons and Dragons. Decent action movie, but doesn't feel like the world of tolkien's books.Ivan Rorick"
2,it was alright,finally watched this Film recently to see what all the hype was all about&while I enjoyed the direction&Shots through out the film I felt like I was watching something along the lines of Harry Potter&this film like that Film just wasn't my cup of tea but it was interesting for being a time period piece if nothing else.
2,Spanish Subtitles?,"The movie was fine, but I want my DVD's with spanish subtitles. What gives? How much work can it be to include them in the DVD?"
2,One movie to stop them all and in the darkness end them!,"This is tooooo boring watch harry potter. Hey don't look at me like that, this movie didn't have quidditch in it,just stupid fantasy and boring effects. LOTR should not go to your head people it is nothing but a stupid fantacy. Any person who goes to church would not watch it because of its title, LORD of the rings! yeah right....never gunna happen! I know HP is fantasy tooooo but oh well..at least it was interesting with a cute guy in it! LORD of the rings...palease...I feel sorry for all of you people!"
2,Too Long!!,"This is good family entertainment complete with a good story line and great anamation. The problem is that it is too long and then it dumps you like Justin did Britney, right on your behind! Wazzzupwitdat?The movie comes to some resolution when the first part of the journey is complete and this would have made a good stopping point. However the journey continues and somewhere in it the movie ends abruptly.It is said that this is how the book ends. If that is so I would rather wait until the series is complete so I don't have to be kept hanging."
3,Not as good as expected,"I had great hopes for this movie, although I only vaguely remembered the books (I read them back in the 60s I think). However, I was quite disappointed. It dragged on and on, with an endless parade of monsters which, though showing off the film makers' incredible technical special effects skill, did not move the plot along. It all became tedious and unrelenting, taking itself far too seriously (with almost no hint of humor to break up the 'suspense'). I was tempted to fast forward through some sections merely to ""get on with it.""Also, since there was not even the barest attempt at character development, I found myself wondering why anyone would care who got the ... ring!Granted, it was an immense challenge to please both the ""Ring"" fans who know the story inside out, and those of us who have only a slight recollection of the story line and characters.Obviously, I'm in the minority here!<G> But I'd have to give this one a thumbs down."
5,Get this for the DTS track and the extra 30 minutes,The only thing I can really add besides the kewl extra 30 mins is the included DTS ES 6.1 track.
2,Horrible .....unless its extented.,"I would have given it 1 star but i liked the extented. See unexdentended its just pointless violence with no storyline. But extended is a very in depth, moralizing story. so skip regular and see extended."
3,SHOW ME THE ENYA!,"i liked this movie it was pretty goodsteven tylers (of AEROSMITH) daughter who was in armagettin weas good in the moviei just wish i didnt have to wait until the end to hear enya's theme song ""by the way"" ... she should of been in the movie more""nobody tosses an elf!"" lol omg that was funny tho hehehe"
3,The Hobbits destroyed a great film.,"Nearly everything in the film is perfect, Gandalf - Brilliant, Aragorn - Perfect. Computer effects, everything top-notch.The Hobbits are a disaster. Elijah Wood - you are no Frodo (Ralph Baskhi had him down to a tee)Sam isn't too bad. But Merry and Pippin! these two singlehandedly destroyed this film for me! I CAN""T STAND THEM!!!! especially the one with the scottish accent.They simply aren't funny - And why did Peter Jackson think the film needed some light relief? If you're going to do it that way - do it properly, like you did with vast majority of this film.Bilbo is fine, but even the other Hobbits in the Shire...... ARGHHH is it just that Jackson has a stupid sense of humour - everything is dumbed down in the Shire - that guy trying to flick away the ear-wax, and the fella being scolded by the wife for laughing at Gandalf's litlle firework display for the young Hobbits - and lines about carrots with a sexual innuendo.......WHY?????"
5,Lord of the Rings,Very well done. Sticks very close to the book. December is too long to wait for the next chapter of this trilogy!
5,lord of the rings review,I think lord of the rings is the best movie I've ever seen.I liked the action and the characters and I can't wait till the next 2 come out. I don't understand the people who said harry potter was better than LOTR. I was looking foward to harry potter but I found it a major disappointment.Also I very much agree with Casey from morree's review. Lagolas is SO hot.A bad point though is that the movie didn't tell much about the characters. Lagolas and Grimle were suppose to end up friends but it didn't really show that in the movie
1,Lord of the Stinks,"This DVD is a waste of money and has no real enjoyable value, only special features, and even those provide no enjoyment. Liv Tyler does bad, Cate is bad, Elijah is bad ,and everyone else does not do a great job. Do not buy it!"
2,The Lord of the Rings,I was very diappointed in this movie. It lacked substance. If you like nonstop fighting then this movie is for you. Other than that it was WAY TOO LONG. About an hour could have been removed.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Unless you are a big Lord Of The Rings fan, as well as big on fairy tale sci fi flicks you are going to fall asleep with this one. After an hour I had to shut it off, aside from the fact that I had no idea what was going on in fairy tale land, the 3 hour long movie just moves at a snail pace! This is a love it or hate it flick, there's really no room in between!"
2,What were they thinking??,"Ok I love this movie & I really liked the new added scenes. So why did I only do 2 stars? Because I think it's ridiculous that they split the movie up over 2 DVD's. Most of the time the ""special features"" are on the second DVD. This time they put ""special features"" on the first two, & then split up the movie between the first two as well. I do not want to have to change DVD's half way through everytime I watch this. It breaks up the continuity of the movie. I don't know what they were thinking, but this was a really dumb idea."
2,A Fantasy World Gone Bad,"The Lord of the Rings, to begin,disapointed me very much. Now this could be because i saw it on video and not in theaters, because the theater makes it more enjoyable. For some reason, you cannot get into the action of the movie. It moves WAY to slowly and just dragssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss on & on & on................. You know what I mean (It gets old)The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the bonus disc. That is probably better than the movie itself. Without the bonus disc (on VHS), this movie would get 1/8 th of a star from me. The Two Towers looks much more active and just downright ""cool"", but I thought the same thing before I saw the first. The only reason I would recommend seing this is to compare it to the book. Its interesting to see what was left out and what changed and so on and so forth. But besides that, spend half the money and get the book. I will continue to to see the next 2 movies, hoping each one will get better."
1,Why has society been brainwashed??,"Why in the world this film is SOOOOO revered is well beyond my capacity. Too Long. Too much bad CG. Too much running from annoying non-plot driving ""threats"". Villians that ain't scary and a slow motion death scene the like of which havent been seen since B rated schlock. You people can have have your sad devotion to a trilogy of films that have more flaws than 10 Star Wars prequels. It is a sad day for cinema...I am only staying anonymous to avoid a hundred thousand virgins emailing hate towards me."
5,Can movies get any better?!?!?!,"If you have not seen the movie then your life is not complete. Lord of the rings is the best movie you can find.I did not read the book, but after i saw the movie i could not help but to go out and buy it right away!(Along with the return of the king and the two towers of course.)Take my advise, The lord of the rings is the best movie in the history of film making..Mr.Jackson is definitly going to be one of the best movie producers,especially if he sticks with this cast!!Hey, I've seen the movie three times and I still can't wait to buy my next movie ticket!!!"
5,MAGICAL MYSTICAL DAYS OF YORE!,"Humans, Hobbits, Dwarfs, Elves, Fairies, trees of the forest and other ""middle- earth"" creatures unite to fight the horrendous hideous warriors unleashed by the dark sinister negative power bent on retrieving the RING, and ruling the world. Alternately beautiful and terrifying, this is an exciting adventure saga. Every scene overflows with action as the little hobbits summon up their courage, keep going to ""save"" the world amid the clash of Wizards. After you see this, you will be eager for the follow-up ""Towers"" and ""Return of the Kings"" which complete this triology. It is an imaginative masterpiece."
5,Exceeded expectations in portrayal of middle-earth,"This is the film that many said could never be done. well, it's done and done well. No Tom notwithstanding, this film achieves the impossible by making middle earth come to life on the screen and seem possible. The casting is perfect and I believe this is Elijah's oscar-winning performance. I really feel that he was snubbed that year. Everything was simply delicious for a fan of middle-earth. Hobbiton, Bree, Rivendell, Weathertop, Caradhras, Moria, Lothlorien, The river Anduin etc...This is a very new and fresh look at Tolkien's masterpiece of literature. It is highly recommended as an introduction to the books as well."
5,An incredible story,"This movie is probably one of the best I have ever seen. The story is very good; the acting is superb; and the soundtrack is marvelous, a great new edition to the music of the fantasy genre. The main theme for the Ring in the beginning of the film is very memorable, as are the themes for the Nazgul and the Shire. The visual effects were stunning. It is hard to tell that this was made three years ago, everything that makes this a great movie still hold up today, and it is still one of the best fantasy stories/movies that I, and many others have ever seen. If you haven't seen this, you should!"
5,"adictive, dust","wow! I was blown away by this movie. Of all of the movies this being released this year i think that this is big compitition. Harry potter was big just like lord of the rings. And many people have read the books. But this will leave Harry Potter in the Dust!When my family saw this movie we all loved it. it was a spectactular show with great actors, action, and excitement. And the cammera shots were great with special effects that it made it just like you were on the adventure with the hobbits and all of their friends.i just hope that i will be able to waite for the next one to come out.This movie was so great i saw it twice in 2 days. It is adictive. And as soon as i can i am going back to see it again"
4,"Worth buying, but see original version as well.","I bought this DVD at a store and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. However, this extended version of the film differs greatly from the theatrical version. It's still the same movie, but added scenes and even changes in line delivery make it seem completely different. If anyone here has not seen the film yet, I advise you see the theatrical version first before checking this one out. It will help you to apprecriate the movie even more."
2,The Load of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"Maybe I just didn't know what to expect. I've never read any of Tolkien's work. I expected action and adventure. There was action and there was adventure, but in addition, there was an excruciatingly long and boring saga about little creatures with big hairy feet. I never developed any feeling for the characters nor did I feel any sympathy for their plight. I can't even remember their names. I was underwhelmed by the ending if you can call it that and saddened there is to be an obvious sequel. [...].Should have gone to see Snow Dogs."
2,Just way too long,"One of the documentaries on the DVD pretty much says it all. They spent over a year in pre-production blowing glass, carving trinkets, and weathering the hobbit village. After all that work, Jackson HAD to get it up on the screen. The result is a movie that makes Attack of the Clones seem taut. There are way too many scenes that are extended just so you can see all the craft work.And this is little more than a movie about midgets being chased by special effects for two hours."
5,The Best,"This movie is the best I've ever seen. ALMOST as good as the books and that is saying a lot.The characterization for the main characters is almost like I origianally imagined them, the effects are amazing, and the score is indescribably good!I love this movie!!!"
4,As good as I hoped,"I've read The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and the Simarillion. I've been amazed at the level of detail that Tolkien weaves into his stories, and I'm drawn back to them again and again.While I love the books and would thoroughly enjoy a full visual version of them, I realize that this is impossible. Even Tolkien leaves a good deal of information out of the Lord of the Rings (partially provided in Tolkien's other works). Given the medium that's being worked with and the time alotted, I think that this movie did a great job of presenting the storyline, portraying the intensity of the quest, and, in general, sucking you into the adventure.Being a fan of the books, I'm puzzled by some of the omissions and some of the changes in the flow of the story, but I think that the movie, as a separate work is still very good.My suggestion would be to read the books and see the movies. You'll most likely enjoy them both."
5,Could it get any better?,"I'll be brief. I loved the theatrical version of TFOTR. Now that I've seen the extended version, I hate the theatrical one. Can't ever watch it again. The extended version adds so much to the story. Makes it almost like watching a completely different movie. Don't waste your money on the lesser version. Buy this one and you won't be disapointed. 'Nuff said."
5,Extended is better,"I had seen the original movie in the theater and loved it, then a friend bought the extended version and showed it to all his friends and family a week before The Two Towers was released. We were all in awe with the little parts added that made the already great movie even greater. The added scenes make sense and are suttle enough to where you don't feel like any of them were unnecessary, in fact, you wonder why they weren't just part of the original movie released in the theater."
4,"Great movie, okay DVD","I only bought this DVD because I didn't see it in a movie theater and I didn't want to wait on the extended version. I say if you want to own a version of the movie save your money and get the extended vesion. The movie is amazing, but the DVD extras are just commercials and trailers that most people probably saw a million times and aren't worth it."
1,More Shafting of Loyal Fans,"Let the movie companies know you are sick of this scam of continually releasing multiple editions. The best way is to hit them where it hurts... bottom line, dollar sign. Do not buy from these companies who continually re-release. Support and purchase from companies like Critereon, who always issue, as far as I know, definitive versions of a flick on DVD. This is shameless baloney, and greedy corporate crap."
1,Wait for the EXTENDED VERSION,"I have to admit, I was pretty thrilled to open my newly purchased Fellowship of the Ring DVD. But my joy turned to horror when the first thing that I saw in the DVD case was not the DVD itself, but a coupon for a $5 mail in rebate on the Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition coming out in November. I felt like a sucker who just lost to the street gambler at the shell game.For this, I would like to personally thank George Lucas and Lucasfilm's marketing division for making it popular to rerelease a movie 5 different times, all with different versions (original, THX, special edition, special edition widescreen, and the version that has all the previews of Episode 1.......you know what I'm talking about).Anyone that likes to get the most bang for the buck should wait for the different version out in November and not waste their money on the ""butchered"" or ""sub-par"" movie release edition."
5,Fantastic!,"Excellent movie, excellent story. I'm sick and tired of the usual Hollywood fare of doctors, cops, lawyers, and serial killers. We need more fantasy and science fiction in our lives because these are the stories that make us think and use our imaginations. We need exposure to ideas that challenge our perspectives and beliefs, and to help us build tolerances for people and ideas that are different from the norm. Having said that, I think it's important to encourage our entertainment industry to take on more such projects. I'm surprised by the previous review, obviously a fellow fantasy fan, who didn't approve of the movie. This is a hard genre to film, and The Lord of the Rings was not only a successful attempt, it's my favorite film ever. But as a fantasy fan, I would be supportive even if it fell short of my expectations. After all, what are my other options? More doctor, cop and lawyer movies."
4,Excellent movie - Lame DVD extras,"I've been a J.R.R. Tolkien fan since I was 10 years old, and I can't give this rendition of LoTR more praise. It's true to the story (though missing a few not-so-essential chapters) and lets us experience it in a way the books never could. The extras... well, hope you weren't planning on knowing ""how they did it,"" because you won't get it here. Be prepared for disjointed previews of the movie you already own and continuous commercials for all of the other LoTR merchandise available. There's an awesome preview of ""The Two Towers"" that has me anxiously waiting for more, though, as well as a preview of the Extended Edition due out in November 2002."
5,Totally satisfied!,"There is nothing to add to all the positive critics you can read below. The movie itself is great, and the extras on the second CDs are a real treat! :)The only thing bad about all this is how cruelly they taunt us with the extended version to be released in November!"
5,Perfection,"I was blown away the first time I saw Fellowship of the Ring last December 19th. Everything, in my mind, was perfect. From the acting, to the scenery, to the monsters and the music. It is far, far and away the best fantasy movie I have ever seen. One of the best movies I've seen, period.The only thing I was unsure of going into it was the expanded role of Arwen, and the fact that it was Liv Tyler playing her. Her performance, however left me enchanted, as did all the other actors. Peter Jackson chose his cast well; every actor suited the part perfectly.There are some deviations from the book's storyline, but those I can forgive. A lot of them were because of time restrictions, and everything flowed evenly. There are times when I wish that there were fewer scenes with Saruman and the Uruk-Hai, but it lends more explanation for the events that come after.The only thing I don't like?That we all have to wait until December 18th to see the next part."
5,Perfection,"Nothing more to say. Never been anything like it. Ever. Not even the Original Star Wars comes close.Technically a marvel that can never be matched. A mastery of not only CGI, but aside from that: Also building whole new chapters on old school lense and in camera effects... never before imagined in the history of cinema let alone realized... and all with Technology that's been with us all along!Steeped with adventure, carefully portrayed characters & deep meaning.God Bless Tolkien & Peter Jackson for giving us these gems."
4,Can any movie do justice to the book?,"The answer is ""no"", of course, but this film gives it a great try and perhaps it comes as close as one can get to the spirit of the book. This is the tale of a long journey, immersed in much history and folklore, and, of necessity, sometimes it feels a bit rushed. Plus, some of my favorite parts of the book are left out of the movie, like the visit to the house of Tom Bombadil and the story of Sam's horse. These things would ""humanize"" (and that term is used loosely when discussings Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs, and Wizards) the characters more, but much ""humanization"" is cast aside to leave more time for swordplay and action, which is what brings people to the theaters in this day and age. What amazed me is that the look of the movie is much the way I visualized things while reading the story. And a great story it is. Despite not quite living up to the book, as impossible as that is, I'm looking forward to the next installment."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"This movie wasn't that great! It was way too long... I almost fell asleep at parts. The acting wasn't the greatest but wasn't bad! The Special Effects were pretty good, but that's not what makes a movie! I give a star for some fine performances, strong plot, and nice settings. But lose stars for mumbling at points, and overlength movie. 3 movies 3 hours long, for each, that is fregon long! I had a hard time sitting through one, imagine 3, good god! Too long for me! Maybe if you got nothing better to do for 3 hours at night, you could watch this. But if you don't, which most people don't, don't watch this! Plus, if you don't like fantasy, it's nothing special, save your money! Rent it, sure, but don't buy it! It's not bad but way over rated! Maybe when I was 10, I would have liked this, but I'm not! So, do yourself a favour and save 3 hours! It should be possible that one person wouldn't care too much about this movie!"
4,A Worthy Portrayal of the Book,"This movie eclipses all previous attemtps at filming the what I consider to be the best novel I've ever read. The technology has finally arrived to portray the great armies of orcs, cavernous domains of the dwarves, and the hidden woodland realms of the elves. The actors filled their roles admirably, and the direction was exquisite. My only objection is that the movie at times deviated signifigantly from the book itself, but not to the point where it irrevocably changed the story; hence my award of 4 instead of 5 stars. Altogether a movie well worth seeing."
4,Waiting for the sequal.,"The movie was great and the best fantasy movie out with great special effects. I can't compare it to star wars. The movie draged on and on as you could feel the movie unfolding slowly. I was real upset about the ending becuase the movie was about two hours plus. Left you hanging for the sequal. Nobody at movie theater claped at the end, only when the guy took the orc's head off.I hope for more testosterone in the sequal.So now I have to wait..."
1,DVD Problems,"Excellent movie, but this DVD did not work on my Philips DVD player correctly. The movie freezes up about half way through... This does not happen on all DVD players though."
2,Too Much Hype,"I went to this movie expecting ""the best movie of the year"" but I unfortunately got ""The most hyped movie of the year"". Sure there were some dead guys chasing the Hobbit trying to steal a ring (sounds real exciting doesnt it), but I think I laughed at parts not intended for laughing... The movie is 3 hours long on top of that, at the end of the film I proclaimed that I would very much want to be thrown into that volcano with that stupid ring than sit through the other 2 sequels. So save yourself the cash and the rear sore from sitting so long, and buy yourself the book instead. Unless that isnt worth reading, I wouldnt know because I never read it, I wasted enough of my time watching the movie. That is why this movie gets 2 stars, for my 2 chuckles I had during the movie."
1,Mac DVD watchers beware,"This is not a critique of the film, but of the discs themselves. Disc 2 of the feature does not and will not play on a Macintosh in DVD Player, so if that's how you were hoping to watch it, don't bother. It stops roughly halfway through disc 2 and nothing after that will play. I have tried on 2 copies now and the same happened to a friend whose discs were from a different source."
3,"Only 3 stars? You bet, but's it's not the movie's fault...","I won't go into a long detailed analysis or description of the movie. If you're interested in the movie, you've probably read the books, if you've read the books you'll like the movie despite some characters and text eliminated. It's a great movie. The movie isn't the problem, it's the DVD of the movie. Two discs with lots of extra stuff, one of the main extras? One of the things they go out of their way to promote? The 10-minute preview of the super-duper four disc DVD edition of the movie you've just purchased... Is it me? Am I the only one that finds this insulting? So, basically what they're saying is: ""Gee, thanks for your money! Be sure to buy the GOOD version when it comes out in November!"" Save your money, rent this movie, enjoy the extras and wait for the ""REAL"" DVD in November."
3,"The Movie is Great, the Extras are Lame","Fans may want to wait until the Extended Version comes out before buying this. Don't get me wrong the film is great and if that's all you want, this disc is fantastic. However, if you are itching for extras, Disc 2 is an utter disappointment. Most of the features come across as adverts for other Rings merchandise (they even advertise the Extended DVD which you will wish you had bought). Much of the same material is re-edited into the 3 documentaries -- you'll grow quickly bored with hearing Cate Blanchett say she's always wanted pointy ears -- and they offer no real insight into the specifics of creating the film beyond your basic ""this guy made the costumes"" and ""this guy drew concept drawings."""
5,DIFFERENT EXTRAS--Not the same as original edition,"For those of you only planning to buy one version of Lord of the Rings, you should know this: The extras included with the original, ""Theatrical"" version (the 2-disk set) are NOT in the extended, collector's edition set. Each has its own amazing set of extras. For a die-hard LOTR nut (like me), it's well worth it to by BOTH."
4,How much Katie Hughes LOVE'S The Lord Of The Rings,"Hi! My name is Katie Hughes. I just want to say that all of the people that are working on these movies of The Lord Of The Rings are so cool. Lord of the Rings is my all time favorite movie it is also my all time favorite book. I love all of the books than have been made by J.R.R. Tolkien. He is such a good writer. I want you guys to do me a big,big,big favor. Can you guys all thank the Guy who had the idea and tell Elijah Wood that he is so good at acting and is very,very,very,very cute?PlzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzLove,Katie Hughes"
2,so what?,"I should admit, first, that I have not read the books, and so I am probably not the audience the film is aimed at, although I do read primarily science fiction and fantasy and have for years. I really wanted to like the movie - went into the theater trying to like it - but I didn't have any emotional ties with the characters at all, and after a while, I frankly stopped caring what happened to them. I don't know why I didn't like it. By all appearances I really should have, but I felt, at the end, that I had seen a movie where nothing happened. No resolution was reached by the characters, there weren't many shifts in the characters' relationships - there weren't any secrets, no real twists - everything was just out there on the table. No suspense at all; they seemed to just be walking around Middle Earth for three hours. I guess you have to have read the books, but I'm really wondering what all the fuss is about"
2,If you loved the books don't waste your time with the movie,"Once agin the old addage ""The book is always better than the movie."" is proved here. Very little was as it should be. I could not watch this movie a second time. Peter should be ashamed at what he did to Mr Tolkien's wonderful story. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I saw this movie. Jackson seemed more interested in highlighting his special effects abillities than telling the story as it should be told. I will live in Middle Earth in my imagination thanks to Mr Tolkien not jackson."
3,"""Lord of the Rings"" Widescreen review","The storyline is great, but I have two complaints: [1] The Widescreen version is not done well; it cuts off too much of the heads of the characters, [2] the sound-track is so loud, you cannot hear the dialogue."
5,Lord of the Rings wonderful but long!,"I went to see this when it was at our Drive In in carlsbad, NM. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Really my only complaint about this movie is the fact that at the end the movie just like stops! And you want it to just continue finish the story. It really leaves you hanging. So after the movie I went home and turned to the last page of the book ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" and it ended exactly the same way. I think that what they should have done was just release all three into one extremely long movie (i mean we're already sitting here so long just make it longer). ..."
4,An awesome movie.,"The Fellowsip of the Ring was an action-packed movie. The action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a movie. I've never read the books, so I can't compare, but Fellowship is a must see. Great acting, great storyline, and great character developement. These are something the sequal lacked, unfortunately. I hope the Return of the King will be more like this movie than the Two Towers.I liked this movie so much that I bought it right after it's release, which was a big mistake. Weeks later, advertisements came out for this ""platinum extended version."" and I felt like I was [cheated.] If New Line wanted to release a platinum-edition Fellowship, they should have released it that way. I want all these features, but I refuse to BUY another Fellowship just for extra features. Oh well."
3,great special effects but...,"people make a big deal over this movie, i thought it was ok . dont watch this if your not into elves and hobbits and wizards and all that stuff. im not really into that but i thought the movie was good overall. good story , special effects and actors. it wasnt that interesting though, all about (a ring).i dont know i guess the film was pretty good. buy it if ur a fan of tolken."
2,Review is for the download speed,Maybe I am the last person to understand Kindle download speeds. On the day of a transatlantic flight we decided to download this. It started but showed a rate that would have taken 2-3 hours. We had to downgrade to standard definition and it came though in about an hour.
5,Bought for my wife,My wife likes this video along with the others bought it for her personally i am not fond of the lord of the rings but it all comes down to personal opinion everyone has there likes and dislikes so if they enjoy the others they will like this one too so enjoy not bad for 2 DVD for 3.99 tho
2,Theatrical Release ONLY,"Please note that this release (2010) contains only the theatrical version of the movie. The Amazon editorials for the 2010 release of the Two Towers and Return of the King clearly state that the film is on a two-sided bluray which contains both the theatrical and extended editions. The Amazon review for the Fellowship of the Ring is a little less clear: ""Extremely useful are the chapter menus that indicate which scenes are new or extended."" This would seem to indicate that the extended edition is included, but that is not the case. All of the LOTR movies are excellent, but the editorials need to be updated."
5,Watch it!,This film is incredibly good. I've been a fan of the genre and loved this movie when it was new. I rewatched them recently and they were just as good.
5,the best i've ever seen,"Even thoughI'm only 13 I have still seen many movies. This is the best me,my faimly,and friends have ever seen.the world of the elves and hobbits are the most magical&peaceful; you cant help but wonder how the dark lord & the ring come to them and there peaceful ways. this is the best movie ever if you havent seen it and are thinking of going I urge you to go and see it.I hoped this has helped. bye.-Danielle"
1,Awful. Horrible. Disgusting. Worst three hours of my life.,Disgusting. Dont really know why so many people like this movie. The orcs are cheesy and I fell asleep a few minutes in. Rather throw twenty dollars into the garbage then buy this DVD.
5,Awesome!,So glad I finally decided to buy this movie!! I've had the regular versions. But they do no justice of the extended editions.
3,Review of:Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring,"First of all, unless the spectator knew the story behind the ""Ring"" and Bilbo Baggins and Gollum, he could be confused as to misunderstand the whole premise of the trilogy.Secondly, there was far too much violence in the movie and not enough to show the intelligence of the Fellowship (members) of the Ring. It would have been nice if the band with Frodo showed some intelligent planning to achieve their objective. The sentence uttered by Aragorn and company ""Let's go hunt some orcs"" was not at all smart! After all, the orcs greatly outnumbered them."
2,hmmmmmm..,"special effects: outstandingacting: goodconclusion: terriblethis movie was good, ill say that. But the ending...jesus christ...it just, stopped.The movie started out srtong in the opening scenes, but started to slowly decline after that. It picked itself up about half or 2/3 of the movie through... and just as the charicters started to develop, it ended. I was hoping for some sort of conclusion to the movie but it was (as I expected) a cut short cliche, to make you come back next year.People are blowing this movie way out of porportion...its good...but its not the best. Its not the second coming people, get a grip...its a movie. If your not into LONG, boring, 3 hour, fantasy movies don't go see this, because thats all it is... your not missing much."
4,Much better than I would have guessed!,I bought this movie with reserves as to how goo di thought it would be but it really proved me wrong. There hasn't been a good fantasy series or movie for that matter in quite sometime and the LOTR has filled a much needed void. With Harry Potter also out we have lots to cheer about with good movies. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because I felt some of the casting was a bit weak particularly with Strider. He doesn't do a bad job but he just isn't as convincing of a leathal fighter.
3,Love the book? You'll love this movie!,"This is a magnificent rendition of the classic book. Watching it though, in all of its beautifully acted glory (at last) I feel quite jaded to its best parts (the ring, the power that corrupts, tiny people with hairy feet, tall black trees, living magic, etc.), and keep droning and dozing off to the actual plot: our heroes rally. Spooky music plays. Bad guys are barely vanquished. Repeat. And repeat again. And again. And again again.Maybe it's just me.But I, me, can no longer believe that I used to love a book that was much like this movie. And the best special effects I've ever seen don't help in any way. To be fair, I must admit that I failed to fall completely asleep at any time while watching this repetitive, pointless, 71-hour-long nonsense. Or for several hours afterward, actually. It does zip along, in the most lasting way."
4,very good,"Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It is definatly worth looking at the extra discs, as they have tons of stuff on the making of the movie. Great to own or rent!"
5,Best Movie Of This Year,"The recent Lord of The Rings left me breathless. I can't wait til' next year when The Two Towers is released, let alone when The Fellowship comes out on video. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, and hey, if you've already seen it, go see it again. I've seen it about 8 times now and I'm always surprised. Yes, a few characters were left out, but it doesn't take away from the movie. ENJOY."
1,Latest blu-ray is a Theatrical Version (178 Min). Save your money for the impending Special Deluxe Extended Edition (208 MIn),"The skinny is this should be subtitled as ""Theatrical Edition"" (178 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (208 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would there be a release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!"
3,"Great story, great audio, horrible video quality","It really is a crying shame the treatment that this great movie received for hi def home video. At times I felt as if I was watching an upconverted DVD. It really is that much of a difference from the other two films in the series. Audio is excellent just like the other two, but my one quibble would be when the fire demon (or whatever he's called) appears. Why on earth was there no bottom end to the growl or roar he did? Other than that, I'd have to end the same way I title the review. Great story, great audio, horrible video quality."
4,Now I'm thinking about buying the extended versions. lol,"What can I say that hasn't been said? These are all great movies, based on a great book. I put off buying these for a few years, waiting for a deal, but finally broke down and bought the more bare bones releases. Now, I'm thinking about breaking down and getting the extended versions. lol"
5,A Must-See Movie and WELL worth your $$,"One of the big bonuses about this dvd set is that all of it, the special features, interviews, etc. is close-captioned for the hearing-impaired (deaf) viewers. A great majority of other dvds, probably about 95%, do not caption their special features! KUDOS to the company who made this dvd set!"
5,absolute magic,"I love movies, and this is my absolute favorite of all time. I've read the trilogy many times, and was honestly expecting not to like the movie as much. But this film blew me away...the characters were impeccably cast, the special effects gripping, the attention to detail throughout is dazzling, and though the story doesn't follow the book to the letter, it perfectly maintains the spirit of Tolkien's trilogy. This film is so utterly engrossing you hate to see it end; I have seen it many times already, and it just keeps getting better. It not only makes you believe in heroes, it makes you want to be one..."
4,A must have in any collection!!!!,"The extended version is a definite must have for true fans of this movie,for the people who read the book, must understand the movie is a shift in dimension and the director is limited by his/her own imagination, nobody can really capture mordor or the shire perfectly!!! but i think that this version was a very good iterpretation of Tolkiens masterpiece Lords Of The Ring, there are many misses in this movie but i understand, so i won't be too critical of that, we have forever to read the book the director have to compact all that into a few hours, if you are lazy like most of us watch the dam!!! movie and you will love it!!! but if you are not satisfied read the book and you will be most definitely be blown away! by your own imagination.This book isn't for everyone just like some people may not like the movie, you must be a passionate dreamer to grasp all the elements that makes this story a true classic laterzzz folks....."
5,The Fellowship of the Ring: Extended Edition,"This first, wonderfully executed installment of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was superb alone by itself. Now, the special edition is what I consider purely excellent, and is almost perfect in every way. This movie is a must have for any Tolkein fan, and will fill you in on the details that were cut out of the theatrical version of this film, not to mention the approx. 8 hours of extras on how the timeless classic was brought to life on film."
5,This is a great movie!,"I saw this movie twice because it was so good! Eventhough I have never read the book, I still think that the movie should get some credit, whether it is faithful or not to the book. It has a nice feel to it and the effects are not too overdone. Being a girl, I appriciate the movie having as little blood as possible. The movie is a little long, but it is worth it. I would advise people to go see the movie but to leave their children under ten at home."
5,Engenius and Wonderful,"Peter Jackson brought Middle Earth to life for it's fans in an engenius and wonderful way that few will forget and many will remember in the coming years. He truly showed Tolkien fans what they yearned to see for so long and those who had not yet discovered the splendor of his magnificent works were shocked and brought into the magic in a way that would change their lives. The cast was wonderful and acted wonderfully, bring the characters to life with shocking realism that has you leaving the theater looking for the Dark Lord and the hobbits (and very sad when you don't see them). It truly is a wonderful movies, and I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD."
2,Surprised to see so many other high reviews,"I was shocked to see so many high reviews about this film. For a film it's good, but for a screen adaptation of a book, it fell utterly short. If I had never read the books, I would have thought it just another Dungeons and Dragons film.My only advice to people is this: if you've read the books, don't see the movie. If you've only seen the movie, don't read the books. Peter Jackson missed the point of the books. Why else would he have made so many changes to the plots. He changed the character's personalities, motives, actions, etc.... I dare not list all my complaints here, save I may offend some people who enjoyed or may enjoy the film."
3,The Fellowship Falls Short,"The making of this film is terrific. Since I had read the Triology many, many years ago I was looking forward for some time for this DVD issue. All through the viewing I loved it's attention to detail. The sound was grand, but often the musical score overshadowed the dialoge. In many cases it was so loud the speech could not be heard at all! And then finally 'the End'!! What a disappointment; we're left hanging to await another release (which I now learn is not until November 2002). If I had known this I would not have bought this release! Just a ploy to get more money out of the customer and into the producers pockets!"
4,"Tremendous movie, sub standard dvd","First off, the movie itself is fantastic. I do believe tolkein would have been proud. but i won't bore you with details of the actual movie, but i would like to warn you of the dvd. The first few times i put the disc in, everything went smoothly. However, i recently noticed that the audio fades in and out at some points. I removed the disc to check for a scratch, however i found none. I re-inserted the disc and ran it through the same scene where the audio failed, and it ran fine this time. I hadn't changed any of the audio settings, yet none the less i still hear the audio fade in at random points of the dvd. I doubt this problem is present in all dvds, but be warned, you may experience some audio difficulties, but i still suggest you buy the dvd anyways."
5,Magnificent,"This movie is a masterpiece. Combining intense action shots, rolling landscapes, and well-developed characters, this movie is the archetypal adventure. But the wonder of this movie is that it is not limited merely to the surface level of action and adventure; it conveys deeper themes about life. In allegorical form, it shows the epic distinction between good and evil, the utter corruption of sin, and the sovereign care of God. It shows the joys of simple living, and the beauty of culture in middle-earth. All of this lifts you upward to the climax of emotion and gratefulness for the life God gave both the hobbits and us humans.Though I missed seeing the Lord of the Rings in the theatre, this DVD made up for that tragic blunder. All the same, you may wish to wait for the extended edition, containing an extra 30 minutes of footage over 4 DVDs, to come out in November. It sounds very good."
5,The Fellowship of the Rings,This movie is one of the best DVD's that you can buy. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who liked the Lord of the Rings books.
5,Lord of the Rings,"Ok, I realize that this is blasphemous, but I loved this movie much more than the book. There, I said it. I was really worried that they would ruin the story with a bad movie, but it was even better than the book. I was amazed at how faithful it was to what Tolkien wrote. The acting was absolutely perfect. Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalph were great, but my favorite was probably Sam. Sean Astin really captured his devotion and love for Frodo. And how about that Legolas? Whew. This is definitely among my top 5 movies of all time. I was so [mad] when it didn't get Oscars for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor. And Elijah Wood should have been at least nominated for Best Actor. The scene where he confronts Boromir was Oscar-worthy in itself. Don't listen to any of these whiny little fools who say it was too long. I would have sat through it if it had been ten hours long."
2,new zealand is a pretty place!,"this movie is strong on special effects and scenery - makes me want to jump on a plane and go to nz - but it's weak on story and characterization. i cringed every time someone opened their mouths to speak. the film drags for the first hour and a half, and it's not until the fellowship is formed and they start off on their little journey that the story starts to be interesting. but even then, it's only really riveting in the battle scenes which were well done. there was enough here to make me curious how the story continues. but it's not good enough to make me shell out the [$$$] to see it at the cine, much less the [$$$] to buy it. i'll borrow it from my local library - for free. that way, i won't feel like i didn't get my money's worth."
5,Much Better Than The Theatrical Release,"I have to admit that when I first saw the movie I thought it was just good. After seeing the extended edition, I would have to saythis is one of the best movies I've seen.The extended version brings some of the characters more to life. One of my favorite addition was the dwarf's words to the elf queen, very deep considering the animosity between the elves and dwarves. This is the ultimate story of good and evil and how good must always keep on guard for the weaknesses they have. There are so many things to learn from this movie. This is not just an action flick, but a life lesson.I am currently reading the book and yes the movie takes certain liberties with the story but he never loses what's at the heart of book.The movie runs about three and a half hours and this may be a bit long for some but since the movie spans two discs you you can watch it over two nights."
5,An excellent rendering of a literary masterpiece,"I, who have seen many of the great, classic movies, felt that this one may well be the greatest film ever made. If it bores some, fine; this is merely a demonstration of their lack of taste and poor attention span. ""The Lord of the Rings"" turned out better than I expected. In spite of the discontent of some of the exceptionally devoted, who fussed over the minor instances of artistic and poetic license, I feel that it offers a wonderful rendition of the story. I advise all to purchase it; it is a newborn film classic."
5,I Love the Movie,"I think that the movie is the best ever. It has a relly good story line, and the best part out of the whole movies would be when Orlando Bloom comes into the story. All the actors are really good and the special effects are excellent, mainly when at the start there's the war, with the volcano. The special effects were also good whe they were going down the river with the hudge statues.I thought that the movie was really good and i can't wait untill the next one comes out sooner this year..."
5,Best set of DVDs I ever got,"I've never seen so many features on a DVD set, so this collection is great. Provided many insights to the making of FoTR. A must-buy if you're a fan of the movie."
4,A good display,"The movie was rather accurate to the books. There were things that were unexplained, but other things that were foreshadowed prior to thier initial time, giving those of us that have read the books a bit of a suprise.The effects were good and the casting was done very well, and the story is portrayed with out major flaws. One of the best book to movie films I have seen."
3,Not enough...,"Yes, the movie was great... lots of good effects and all that; But the whole tale felt very rushed... (though, you might too if chased by myriad nazgul.) NEVERTHELESS, More waiting should have occured prior to the making of this film... it simply doesn't quite meet the standards set by the books. I'll buy this movie and all its sequels... but I may always be holding out for a remake... say, in about 2043 when they'll project the films right into your head for first-person perspectives... and all that."
4,Beautifully crafted film - loyal to the spirit of the text,"Wow! The special effects were remarkably and seemlessly integrated into the best adaptation (by-far) of The Lord of the Rings. The top three scenes: the cave troll, Gandalf and the Balrog, and Lady Galadriel of Lothlorien. Powerful performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Unfortunately, even after splitting the story into three full-length movies there still isn't enough room to do justice to the actual books. There is more character development in the books, more identification with the main characters. For example, when the sorrowful scenes played out in the movie, I remained unmoved. Maybe it's only me, but there wasn't enough time with the characters to feel any emotion for/with them. That's my only criticism, however, on the whole I loved the film (I saw it twice). ""I am a servant of the secret flame!"""
5,It stands by itself,"Even if you aren't a huge Tolkein fan, you may enjoy this movie yet. It is very true to the book though, a rarity amongst blockbusters. The cinematography and scenery is breathtaking. It was well-shot, well-directed and well-casted. It gets a bit overwhelming at times because there are a lot of characters and places to keep track of. It's a bit lenghty, but you really couldn't tell the story any other way. Overall a very good film."
1,Not extended release!,Why can't the Company release the Extended (and much better) versions of these films on Blu Ray?? What is the hold up? I will not buy another version of these films. Period.Stop wasting my time and release the ones that the rest of the public want.
5,Lord of the Rings is so cool,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has special affects and great picture. My favorite charcter was Legolas he is so cute. I like the hobbits hairy feet. Gimli is cool and funny. I like the giant squid and the fire monster that almost killed Gandalf
2,Lord of the Bores,This movie stunk! I even fell asleep during it. All they do is walk fight walk fight walk pre-pare to fight enemy runs away ends in a stupid way. What a boring day.
5,"Prophet JRR Tolkien would be pleased, and so will you","After seeing the film today I will share this with you all, from the view point of someone personally involved:While a few special emotional moments were missed in favor of pacing, (especially a scene between Sam and Frodo when Frodo finds out Sam has told Merry and Pippin about Frodo's quest, and Aragorn's sword not being broken) over all this was a delightful experience and I totally enjoyed how much of the original story did survive.True, if Universal or MGM had had the vision to make the movie, there are undoubtably little ""movie things"" that would have been better, (ie: Disney's Pearl Harbor was made by guys would never heard a gun really fired)but they did not, and all of us who love these stories must take our hats off to Mr. Jackson & Company, (Thorin & Company, if you will) and in my case, that's quite a hat.I would gladly recommend this film to anyone.....and I expect to buy all the DVD's, if the good Lord allows me to live that long."
4,Faltan Subtitulos,"Una de las Mejores peliculas de la decada, el diseño y la presentacion del producto es de primera, pero es una lastima que no incluya subtitulos en español como la segunda y tercera parte."
1,Bored of the Rings,"Three hours! Zero character development and even less development of the relationships between the characters. Extremely elaborate setup for something (I guess this is the mystery), 2 1/2 hours of which (at least) was dedicated to the seemingly same dark battles with underexplained evildoers..."
2,IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU,Most boring movie I've ever laid eyes on. I can't imagine what the extended version is like.
2,LotR - DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"Hey, I loved the movie - but this DVD is just a marketing ploy. The real DVD set doesn't come out until November, wait for it! The extras on this DVD add absolutely nothing but advertising."
2,"Good visuals, but misses the mark","Peter Jackson has directed a visually stunning, but empty movie. The scenery and costumes are worthy of the book, but the script is lame and the characters have no depth. Choppy editing takes viewers on a roller coaster ride, hurrying from action scene to action scene, depriving audiences of the opportunity to gradually immerse themselves into what should have been a rich fantasy.The actors are competent but seem shallow, disposable, not unlike what has happened in recent Star Wars films. The lone exception being Sir Ian McKellen, who imbues the Gandalf character with lived-in warmth and wit.All in all, this film is a must-see for Tolkien fans, since the story is brought to life here with lavish attention to detail. However, it is a triumph of form over substance. Let's hope that the sequels offer better character development, stronger scripts, and less frantic editing."
5,"amazing movie, great dvd","""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an awesome movie with terrific acting and special effects. Now it's been made even better with the Extended Edition. This dvd has the extra scenes put right into the movie, so it's a different version than was seen in theaters. The extras are great too. ""The Fellowship of the Cast"" is a good documentery where the cast members are interviewed. In it you'll hear funny stories while shooting and other tid bits of info you can't get anywhere else. With the added scenes and over 6 hours of extras, any Tolkien fan (assuming that you liked the movie) can't go wrong with this 4 DISC set. 4 DISCS- 5 stars."
1,Incredibly boring,"Although the DVD hold the interst somewhat better than the book, The Lord of the Rings remains incredibly boring."
1,Jerks,"I recently purchased a shiny new copy of the Extended edition and it will not play on my computer. The computer doesn;t even recognize the disc (runs XP). My 98 machine saw the disc but couldn;t play it. the DVD decoders didn't even recognize the disc. Needless to say I'm disappointed and angry. I loved the movie, though much less than the books, but it is a shame that greedy companies like New Line have to introduce their unlawful and unadvertised copyright schemes into the disc."
2,BORING!!,"When I saw comercials it locked good. So I took my friends to see it and all of the liked it but I thought it was stupid. The movie just keeps draging. Yeah it is loyal to the book but it is just so slow moving. I had never really slept through a movie in my life but this I did for at least 30min. But I will admit the visual effects are wonderful and sometimes creepy, the music was also neat and somethings were kind of dark and gave a nice scary touch to the film. Still, nothing will beat Jurassic Park 3 and Harry Potter."
2,One of the most slow movie films ever.,After all the hype how could I not see this movie. The special effects were great and the story was very unique. Did this film need that much detail. It draged draged draged on and on and on. I was so bored while watching this. I thought it would never end. This is boring plain and simple. During the best action sequence in the film with the cool looking very realistic trol. The camera moved so much I could barly see what was going on. Overall if you like to see charactors hike though cool scenery for hours this is for you.
5,GREAT SERIES OF MOVES!,"Loved it all! Someone stole borrowed my copy and never returned it. so, I had to replace it because I could watch the series over and over again! Get it NOW!!"
1,..............,"I just don't get it. Why is LOTR getting all these awards and promotions when it's not even that good? It's not the worst, but still, it's pretty bad.The responses to my last negative LOTR review is crazy, like 2/51. I just want to say thank you to those two people!Like I said though, and I still stand by it, You either love LOTR or hate it. At least thats the hint I got from my friends and family. It's either ""OMG Lord of the Rings is the best thing that ever happened to me"" (Okay, slight exaggeration) or ""Lord of the Rings is a peice of ($...)I want to burn every single copy of the (d..n) thing!"" (No exaggeration)Well, let's face it, a single opinion isn't going to matter in this world, but I just want to put in my input. Thanks for reading!"
1,Lord of the What?,"Naw you got be a big fan to like this movie,i dont know why the Book is always better then the movie. Another movie the media has made a big deal of and the people follow."
1,Bad Movie,This movie sucks. The animation is bad. Its to long for what the point of the movie is. If i were you i wouldnt buy this movie it sucks big time
1,The Longest Movie EVER.,"If you didn't like this movie, it's okay. You're not alone. Most people like it and don't understand how anyone could not be delighted with it. But... I wanted to love this movie, I truly did. But I didn't. It was awful.Within the first several scenes Frodo was a dozen different sizes when shown beside Gandorf or whatever his name was, so I spent the rest of the movie watching him change sizes. Sometimes Frodo came up to G's waist. Sometimes he was taller than his shoulders. Sometimes he was a wee tiny thing. Sometimes he was the height of a normal person. You never knew how big Frodo was going to be.And the fight scenes were SO redundant. I didn't leave before it was over, but only because the people I was with were enjoying it so much.So, if you loved the books, by all means, see the movie. You'll probably love it. If you thought they were long and boring, the movie will be the same...."
1,Having trouble sleeping?,"Trouble sleeping at night? Well let this movie bore you to sleep, if not to death. The fight for Middle Earth... blah,blah,blah. Ok, ok end the movie already, GEESH!"
1,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. The writers took a long-winded book, and turned it into a fast-paced, gripping film. My problem isn't with the movie, it's with the DVD.Why do we buy DVD's instead of Videos? Okay, the picture is better, but the main reason I buy a DVD is for the extras! This DVD had crappy extras. No extra scenes, no revealing anything. The extras are little more than the trailers that we all already saw in the movie theatre for months leading up to the big sceen launch.Okay, but the movie's still great, isn't that enough reason to buy the DVD? Not in this case. Apparently they are releasing another version of this DVD in November with new extras! So I guess this release was just aimed at the impatient suckers like me!"
1,For fanboys only,"I'm sorry, but did I miss something here? Could this movie be just a little bit more BORING? It's nothing but a series of repeating images and self-important dialog. This movie is nothing but close-ups of someone's hand that reveals the ring, shots of a persons face with their eyes bugging out and their mouths hanging open as if they can't believe what they are hearing, dialog meant to be grand but is just laughably pretentious, ham-handed action scenes with WAY too much slow motion, and wild camera shots that are either dizzying CG work that you can't even comprehend, or SLOW sweeping shots of the landscape as characters either walk, boat, or otherwise trudge their way through the countryside. There is absolutely NO sense of adventure or wonder in this movie. There is not one character to care about. The acting is stilted and horrible. The so-called dilemmas are either way too predictable or lamely resolved. The ending just downright sucks. As a matter of fact, so does this movie."
1,WATCH THIS IS YOU CANT SLEEP!,"SORRY TO SAY, BUT THIS MOVIE, COMPARED TO HARRY POTTER WAS BORING-UNLIKE HARRY POTTER, THERE WERE MANY BORING SCENES, AND I JUST COULDNT GET INTO THE MOVIE... THE ACTORS WERE PRETTY GOOD- SAME WITH THE EFFECTS, BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS BORING- IN OTHER WORDS, WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING!"
1,Walt Disney would be proud,"If its a sword movie you want to see, don't waste your timeNot a drop of blood is spilled in this entire film.It's way too slow, the special effects look like they were bought a Kmart, there are no memorables lines/quotes.If you like Walt Disney films this movie is for you.If you want to see great battles with swords you will be very disappointed."
1,"long, boring, like reading a 3 and a half hour comic book!!!","This isn't like a classic novel come to life. It's more like a comic book become a cartoon!!! SOOOO, much animation!! JUST ACT, DANGIT. It was like the actors just stood there in a dessert somewhere going ""AHHHHH!!!"" Then, 3-d animation did the rest. SOME WHOLE CAHRECTERS WERE JUST CARTOONS WITH A DUDE IN A BLUE SUIT AND VOCALS. The special features make it look like they actually had to ACT. Not only that, but I never cared for the books myself...."
1,The worst movie ever!!!!!!,I hate it its the worst movie ever. Everyone likes it but I hate it its the stupidest movie ever. Please realize how horrible this movie really is.
3,Pretty Good!,I honestly have no idea as to why everybody hails this movie as a masterpiece. I think its a good movie but not as good as all the hype makes it up to be. Anyway I like the action sequences and other stuff but one downside is it's WAY too long! It does have its good points to it. It's very emotional like when Sean Beans character dies I cried and I was sad when I thought Sam was dead. But anyway its pretty good but in my opinion not great.
1,I don't get it,"I tried to watch this acclaimed film from Director JRR Tolkein, but it was too visually static and flat. Perhaps Tolkein was too close to the project, having written the books and all - turning the films over to someone with a more discerning eye might have been a better move. Whatever it was, the film would still have not succeeded without a larger budget. I will definitely be missing the next two. Stick with the books, Mr. Tolkien."
1,These reviewers are not for blu ray why are they here.?,"I wish amazon would not put these reviews up here for the Blu ray as they are for the reguklar editions and give no credence to this release on blu ray,we all know about the other issues of this film,what we need here and what apparently Amazon does not is that the reviews here need to be only for the blu ray issue not the regular one.lets get thing going right here Amazon and start only putting reviews up that are relevant to the release that is on the screen here,which in this case is blu ray.And we know the listing is incorrect here to as there are not 9 discs in the blu ray set only 3"
5,Perfect for any Lord of the Rings fan!,"I bought these right when they came out the year after the theater release and it was so exciting for me. To see those extra scenes and learn more about the characters was a lot of fun. Great idea for them to do this because there are so many followers of the books and movies. Expecially with The Hobbit coming out soon, those extra scenes do fill you in on some points that you wouldn't know unless you read the books. Great set!"
4,"Great Movie, (Great gift)","Bought this as a gift, they loved it. Nice extras included on Disc 2 like :Featurettes, exploring the Locales and Cultures of Middle-earth, and Enya's ""May it be"" music video.. priced good. fast shipping.Thanks Amazon, I was able to buy a nice gift, at a great price"
1,It won't play on my XBOX,I can't play this DVD using my XBOX playback. Microsoft has just added it to a secret list of DVD's that won't play on their XBOX DVD playback system along with Snowwhite & Star Wars Episode One. Now I guess I have to but a DVD player just to see the deleted stuff.
3,Why not 1 DVD for the feature?,"My only complaint about both extended versions (standard and collector's) is this: Why did the feature have to be on two DVD's?! Because its half an hour longer? Yes, that's true, but I don't think that's why. I think the reason the movie had to be split to two DVD's is because there are seven settings for the sound! Seven! Three for the type of surround sound and four for the audio commentaries. Why not produce one DVD with commentaries and one without so as to keep the viewer from having to stop his/her movie experience so they can switch discs. That is the great thing about DVD's over laser discs. DVDs are smaller and you didn't have to switch between discs (I remember Aliens taking three laser discs).It's too bad the makers of the movie didn't follow one simple rule: One disc to rule them all..."
1,Yawn-fest,"This review is really a warning to anyone who isn't specifically interested in that fairies, wizards and magic kind of fiction. If you don't like that sort of stuff, DO NOT attempt to watch this. I tried twice and I just could not get through it. There were just too many little things that bothered me and that I had to roll my eyes at. The worst part of this ordeal is that the movie moves SO slowly and it's SO long!"
3,overrated,"I read the books when I was a kid and loved them, so I saw the movies everyone seems to be so crazy about. They were okay, but they put me in mind of Tolkien's world as imagined by people who play lots of Dungeons and Dragons.Ivan Rorick"
3,hoping,"I havent finished reading the book yet (half way through) but from what I have read so far, its the best book ever made. Then when I learned they were going to make a movie, I was gald that they were going to make a movie that didnt have drawn people as the main characters.Then I started thinking. Can they make a live movie that can live up to the book? How can they show a balrog, who is suppose to be just evil and almost shapless? How can they show the extreme beauty of Lorothien? And what about Saroun? And how can they make us belive that Moria is such a evil place?And the Land of Mordor? I will see the movie, but my hopes aren't that high."
5,love this movie!,"This is such a beautiful film in all ways. It's an instant classic, and I absolutely love it. The acting is top-notch, the direction is fantastic, and everything is wildly believable."
4,Seamless streaming,"Had no trouble with the download and streaming, it was seamless, quick and uninterrupted. Not entirely sure I was getting HD quality, and the sound level was a little on the low side. But no complaints beyond that."
2,The Load of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"Maybe I just didn't know what to expect. The critics have just raved about this movie. I've never read any of Tolkien's work. I expected action and adventure. There were action and adventure to be sure, but in addition, there was an excruciatingly long and boring saga about little creatures with big hairy feet. I never developed any feeling for the characters nor did I feel any sympathy for their plight. I can't even remember their names. I was underwhelmed by the ending if you can call it that and saddened there is to be an obvious sequel. Only the fact that I paid $9 for the ticket kept me in my seat. Should have gone to see Snow Dogs."
2,"new technology, new disappointments","Is more less? It is with DVD.I bought LOTR Extended Edition expecting that I would be able to watch a full screen version from the wide-screen file on disc. I also thought I could watch the original cut from the extended cut by making a simple choice on a menu.But no. Although the two items I want are subsets of the data on disc, they are not available to me. So I have to watch the 2.35:1 movie in letterbox format, which leaves about 30-40% of my TV screen black.I also can't enjoy the original, more prudent cut. The theatrical version is a more impactful cinematic experience than the meandering extended version. The extended version is a curiosity, not something that will entertain repeatedly.Be aware of these limitations when buying the LOTR EE DVD, and also any DVD product today. It's easy for the hype surrounding DVD to hide basic shortcomings that will only be discovered after you have spent money."
2,o.k,It was o.k the only good thing about the movie was that Orlando Bloom was totally HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,IT DOESNT HAVE SPANISH SUBTITLES,"The Movie is awesome, everybody knows it.But who in the studio decides to release it without spanish subtitles? There are a lot of people like me who needs that."
4,Details...,"I know its hard to fit so much into such a relatively short space of time, but it would have been nicer to see a few more details added. Such as the film completely missed out the fact that Legolas & Gimli had become good friends. Generally excellent, but i think a few more added details would have added to the effect."
4,Good,"First of all, as amazing as this was, it was not even CLOSE to the Star Wars trilogy...some who say it was just like Lucas...""playing with his toys"" are wrong because the Star Wars trilogy appeals to people of all ages...from grandchildren to grandparents. The LOTR trilogy is not for all audiences."
5,The Fellowship of the Rings...,"was AMAZING! From the first frame to the credits, the movie was absolutely breathtaking. The cast played their roles perfectly, while the music played with the movie. Peter Jackson gives great direction, and the story itself was epic. Everyone should go see this movie."
5,Simply Amazing,"I had not read the Lord of the Ring's trilogy until the summer before this movie was released in the theatres. I went through the books quickly and found myself at the theatre four times to watch this film. I have never spent so much time in a movie theatre for one film in my life! Plus I've watched the DVD 3 times at home.I love this film. Each time I watch it I truly escape to another world. Although Tolkiens books do have more wonderful detail, the movies do them excellent justice. You get emotionally attached to the characters and follow it as if you were in the movie yourself. Even my fiancée loves this film and has sat through it at home a couple times herself.The cinematography, the special effects and the amazing actions and battle scenes. Unlike anything else ever seen. The DVD is worth every penny and these books should be a standard for every 8-9 year old to get them hooked don reading.Amazing film, looking forward to the next."
3,Too biased towards action,I love TOlkien & think he is one of the GREAT 20th century writers. that said this movie is an uneven tribute to his genius and too much to put towards the action equation & not enough towards the adventure. Still probably the best out there.Legolas
5,Got to be good,"The book was good. The original movie was better, but, come on, if those were good this has got to be good. The movie is must buy. If you bought the original I would not buy it but if you haven't go get this one. If you haven't see the movie rent it. But this Platinum Series Extended Edition has got to be good."
2,Save your money for the upcoming Blu Ray Director's Cut... This is NOT it!,"This is the Theatrical Version (178 Min). Wait for the impending Special Deluxe Extended Edition ""Director's Cut"" (208 MIn) containing the additional 30 minutes of footage. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,original version?,"Right now I'm kicking myself for buying this dvd. If you are considering buying this dvd, don't. Wait until the Special Extended Edition comes out. If you want to see the movie, then rent it. But, if you want to see the scenes that were deleted, DON'T buy this dvd. It doesn't contain a single one. If I were you, I'd buy the Special Extended Edition, which will contain an additional 30 minutes of the film not seen in the theatrical version."
2,It Bombed,"I remember when Peter Jackson was known for his originality as a director and Christopher Lee's films were not full of cliche. Instead, this is one sword and sorcery cliche of another. It was going to be rated G but they made it PG13 as a joke that most people wouldn't be able to see it. I'm not going to tell you what the joke was. You can get this 3 movies 3 days 3 dollars at the movie store or free at the library. To its merit, the cliches are accurate."
3,"Film is Great, Bookends are Pathetic!","If I were rating the film only, I'd give 5 stars, hands down. The bookends I got, however, are pathetic. My Isildur has some sort of a growth on his chin, and wobbles on a flat surface. These are not heavy enough to hold books. They can hold the DVD's perhaps, but not books. Also, the paint job is nowhere near what it should be. The bookends in the photo seem to be nicely highlighted. Mine are highlighted on the top only, and I am sorely tempted to redo the paint job myself, and re-base them so they can be used as the bookends they are advertised to be."
5,Best DVD in the world,"If you take the time required to view all the content contained in this mother of all special edition DVDs then you have my pitty. I know, I've done it (whew). If you're reading this because you don't already own this set (and you even slighly enjoyed the movie) then you should be ashamed. What, you can't afford it? Go sell some of those lame DVDs you already own and buy this one!"
5,Cinematically stunning and faithful to story,"This is easily the best movie I've seen in years. The scenery is a visual delight and the characters are well-acted too. Ian McKellen is best-suppoering-actor nominated as Gandalf. While he is certainly good, I think it's the dimunitive Hobbits that steal the show. I read the book years ago. In all the details I can remember, this movie is an accurate retelling. It should make Tolkien fans out of some who haven't been before, though I wouldn't call it a substitute for the books themselves. But it is a must see for those who are fans already, and it can be considered a wonderful supplement to the original. Often I find movies based on books I've read to be visually disappointing, but this made Middle Earth even more visually stunning than I had previously imagined. I'm sure many of us will be eagerly awaiting the sequels."
3,Movie Magic but Poorly Mastered DVD!,"I managed to get my copy of the Region 1 widescreen DVD early but I have noticed that the movie has been mastered with an incorrect aspect ratio. Or rather, the film is in its correct theatrical ratio of 2.35:1 but the actual DVD transfer is more like2.40:1, with the image squashed slightly. Just compare it to footage of movie in the supplemental material on Disc 2 or footage from The Two Towers also on Disc 2.This is a great shame as everything else about the DVD quality is exemplary. I sincerely hope this will be rectifed,if not for future pressings of this DVD edition, then certainly for the forthcoming Special Extended DVD Edition."
4,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"i have read the books. i have seen the first film. for what tolkien created and what they had to work with, it was a fabulous film. ten years ago, this film couldn't have been created. with today's technology, we are now up to par with tolkien's imagination. it is a fantastic film and i can't wait for the second."
5,The best movie of the decade!,"This is by far the best film I have seen in the past ten years of my life! I cannot remember a 3-hour film that I have seen in the theatre 3 times being any better! The scenery, characters and customes bring the audience deep inside the mind of Tolkien's world and you are never able to leave!Wonderful performances from Sir Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean raise this film to the top of my ""all-time best movies"" list.This is a definate thrill ride and a wonderfully fantastic film that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. See this film in the theatre for the 13 Academy Nominations they well deserved including Best Picture, Cinematography, Custome Design, Sound, Director and much much more!This is the one film I have seen that deserves to win all 13 Oscars! Absolutely Fabulous!"
5,Wonderful set!,"I got this set last year. I wasn't sure what to expect at the time that I placed it into my DVD player, but I was a huge fan of the theatrical version and I knew it could only get better! It was better than I expected. The additional footage adds so much depth and so much more characterization that I can't understand why it wasn't apart of the original release. Simply amazing! Also the bonus material is nothing short of awesome! If you liked the movie in the theater BUY THIS NOW! If you are not sure, get this and THE TWO TOWERS: EXPANDED EDITION, and get ready for the third film, because they will get you hooked!(GIFT SET INFO: This set comes with the movie, plus a set of bookends, and an addition disc with a documentary on the books. The set is beautiful, and the bookends are just wonderful. Spend the extra money and get the gift set!)"
5,Hopefully the start of a new trend.,"I remember reading on a home theatre website that LOTR was going to be released in a theatrical version first followed by a director's cut later on.Upon reading that, I was furious. I'm here to say now that if you can serve up my words on a platter, I will eat them.It still kind of bugs me that I almost bought two versions of this film, but the extended version does add so much excellent backstory and detail to the main film that I admit it was well worth the wait.Not one person that I've shown this film to has not liked it. This is truly epic filmmaking and should be (not necessarily budget or special effects wise, but in vision, directing and acting) the baseline of what constitutes a ""good film.""I cannot recommend this film any higher."
5,LEGOLAS IS SOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!,"I totally LOVED this movie! Legolas is so cute! It was sad at some parts, and there is A LOT of fighting. It is really hard to explain, and I don't want to give anything away. If you don't mind some blood, and love adventure, you should see this, along with the other movie...He is the cutest, and is sooo my FAVORITE character!!!..."
3,Great Movie! Poor DVD Extras.,"This movie is one of the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy films around. The characters are well developed along with the story. Although the movie is slightly different than the book (omissions of some characters) it still remains a solid adventure story. Please note that the 3 star rating is for the DVD, not the movie.The disappointing DVD released in August is a let down. It only includes theatrical trailers and some made for television specials as extras. The most aggravating of which was a promo for a better DVD version coming out in November. The extras seemed to be one big commercial for future products, not giving any real insight to the planning, producing, or character development.My advice, borrow the DVD from a friend who got snookered into buying the August version. Wait and buy the November edition which will include more sneaks of the up-coming film along with better commentary."
2,I COULD NOT GET INTO IT,I ONLY READ HALF THE BOOK SO I CANT REALLY COMPARE it to that but i think this movie was just okay. i felt it was one of thos movies were every ten seconds something chasing them or there in some danger after a while the constant danger gets boring.
5,Movie lives up to book 100%,"Most of the time, movies are spawned from great books and novels. Many a time though, the movies don't live up to the book. Sure, some of them turn out to be great movie despite the fact that it doesn't live up to the book. Then, there are those that not only not live up to the book, but just down right bombs. (The Shining with Jack Nicholsan for example.) However, with Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, the movie lives up to the book. Even though it excluded some of the off side adventures of the story in the book, the movie remains loyal to the book's main story line. (It can't be expected that the movie could include everything, it already is three hours long, I'm sure if they had the money they would.) For all those who haven't seen the movie in fear that it will not be loyal and true to the book, rest assured. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship is a wonderful movie and can't be any truer to the book."
2,2 Discs / Branching?,"OK, here's the problem. Great concept, bad execution. Two disc set alledgedly holding both the theatrical and the extended films. One would assume this 2 disc set was one disc holding each version of the film. Well, one would be WRONG!! This ""branching"" is basically like using a laserdisc where it will cause an intermission where you must get your lazy but up and switch the discs. In some DVD players, when you change the discs, it even makes you reset the audio for bloody sake! less than 1/2 the theatrical version is on the first disc along with less than 1/2 the extended version. The second disc is the remainder of both films! haven't we come far enough with technology to be able to put one entire theatrical film on one disc and one entire extended film on another disc?? On a good note, the conceptual art for these covers looks amazing. I may end up being trapped in Peter Jackson's ""shelob's web"" anyway! : )"
1,Do not buy the 2 disc version.,"I have been noticing that this 2 disc version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS has been close to the top of the sales rank and i dont know why because there is a SPECIAL EXTENDED DIRECTORS R-RATED EDITION coming on November 12th.This version has 30 minutes of new footage and commentary by 30 yes 30 members of the cast and crew,it could just be the greatest dvd ever made.It will also have abou 20-25 feauteretes a ton of making of documentaries and a dvd-rom.Also their is a gift set coming out on the same date which almost has the same things but costs more.So i encourage you if you are thinking about buying this 2 disc version forget it and wait to November."
1,Tolkien would roll over in his grave,"My overriding impression was: Evil beasts that were gross beyond the need to be gross, too much violence, not enough story. Long seconds spent in close-ups on Elijah Woods eyes does not a movie make. Frodo ceases to be a character as soon as the quest begins and becomes a ""face"". The same lack of dimension is true for each character in the movie. When Frodo says that he wishes the ring had never come to him, I wanted to jump up and shout ""Same here!"". There is little substance to any of the characters and little character development. The third hour of this film dragged on interminably. The only reason I stayed was in the hope that some of the personality exhibited in the Shire would be evident again. It wasn't. The abruptness of the ending was so unnatural that my thought was that in the editing room someone said ""I'm tired. It's late. Let's just stop here."" A total disappointment!"
5,Amazing.,"I loved this movie so much, I went and saw it 12 times. Many people think I am obsessed, but I find it to be a movie that is good for anytime. I would like to say some constructive criticism.First, Liv Tyler is entirely amatuer in this film. I didn't like how Peter Jackson replaced Glorfindel with her. It is changing the original work of art.Second, I know that Jackson did his best, and I loved it. As did many people across the world, but I think he cut out a lot of important parts in the story. For instance, the gift giving in Lorien. If they showed it, it would have made more sense to why Frodo was holding up a vial and the silver leaves on their cloaks. Anyone who read the book would know why most of them had these things, but a person who did not read it might(not trying to be rude) not understand it as much.But to end on a happier note, The movie was incredible, and let's say when I get outta college I think I'm moving to New Zealand"
5,"Great Movie, Great way to know as much as Possible about it",This Dvd is great for those of us who need to know everything about something we love!!
4,Great Version of LOTR but...,"This is possibly my favoritest movie but there are a few setbacks to it. For one, if you ahve a certain version of a dell computer, you cant play the movie on your computer. The extra 30 minutes of movie time makes the movie great! Oh yeah, on my version, the film is very bright. It is hard to see some of the mountain scenes and the sketches on the appendices. Otherwise it us a great movie for only around 10 more than the regular version!"
5,The real LORD of the Rings....,"This movie is such a masterpiece,you cannot explain how great it is in words....Peter Jackson has made a classic book,into movie magic.Great casting,excellent special effects,and just a magnific' job!Peter Jackson(PJ) brought the story to life!This is a movie everybody should own!It has some violence that parents of younger children should look out for.But,if you are mature enough,you should bring this masterpiece into your household!SO buy Lord of the Rings(LOTR)today!"
4,Excellent except for 1 flaw,"Excellent, but there are a heck of a lot of scenes of Frodo crying, Frodo looking worried, Frodo complaining about the burden of it. Thats the only flaw in the movie, it turned Frodo into a girl."
4,Very good,"I have never read the Lord of the Rings books (except for The Hobbit), so I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the movie. It turned out that the movie was very good, but I had trouble understanding what the characters names were. I got the main ideas in what people were saying, but I had a bit of trouble. The acting was great though! I thought the hobbits were especialy good. My favorite part was prob'ly when Aragon(??) had found the hobbits, and the hobbits wanted to stop for 'second breakfast'. All in all, this was a very good movie, and I would recomend it !"
2,Where's the Director's Commentary on the DVD?,"Really tired of Hollywood pulling this marketing stunt. They did it with Shakespeare in Love, Almost Famous, Traffic, and countless others. I'm boycotting this DVD until the real one comes out in Nov. so I don't have to buy it twice."
2,The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring,"the lack of a DTS sound track on The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring puts it into the ""rental"" category. wait for the DTS version due out next year before you buy."
2,The Worse Piece of Festering Dung Unleashed to Audiences,"It is clear that this film is very boring and it was done on a big budget amateurish basis, for what director would sacrifice plot in the name of 2 hours of eye gouging Orc killing? Did he have something against the Orcs, who stink of urine and rat nests, or did he just want to give us more moments of boredom? I find there to be no redeeming values in this tasteless film which wants to simply reek in great amounts of money, win undeserving oscars and proclaim itself under the pretense of a great film, to be the best movie making experience. A complete waste of time....."
1,Breathtaking,"I went to see the movie yesterday. The cinema was crappy & old. The seats were terrible, the sound wasn't calibrated right, etc. But you know what? I didn't care! The story just overwhelmed me. The movie embraced me and I simply forgot everything around me. This is the best fantasy/sf film I have ever seen!! THE BEST. I think I am addicted already. I want to see it again. And again and again. I have not read the books yet, but I plan to. Some people say the books are better than the movie. Is that truly possible?? If you have not seen this movie yet, you missed the best adventure ever. Go see it!"
1,Talk about STINKER!!!,"Watching this film at a theatre was three of the worst hours of my life. This film is completely empty! All I remember is a lot of effects, battles and Elijah Wood's big-eyed, scared and stupid face. He looked the same for THREE #*@#ING HOURS! I HATE Elijah Wood, I HATE Peter Jackson and I HATE Lord of the Rings!!!!"
1,might cause nightmares,i took my young brother and sister(jack and sue) out to see this movie when it was time to go home jack and sue came out of the cinema crying and frightend the nextday sue told me that she had a nightmare and her heart wasbeating very fast so i am not shure ifkids who are a bit sensitive can watch it
1,I'm disapointed to say the least,"This film is perfect and magical in every way,but if the dvd specifications are correct,WHERE is the DTS ES 6.1 transfer?There is no other way to see this film,you need that extra surround back channel to fully appreciate this masterpiece(2 speakers behind the listener).They got everything else right with this dvd,but they dropped the ball big time with the sound transfer.I'll wait to see if a 6.1 DTS transfer wil be offered.As a result some audio information from the master print will have to be deleted in order to accomodate the DD 5.1 track.There are sounds found in the original that will not be on the DVD."
4,Hold Out A Little Longer,I have seen this movie many times at the movie theater and the only way to watch it is in wide screen. This is a great dvd with good special features. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because there is suppose to be another special edition coming out the first of November. It will be a three or four disk collection and contain somewhere around thirty minutes of extra scenes that are actually added into the film. It will probably be a better buy in the long run.
5,Landmark accomplishment in cinema,"J. R. R. Tolkien's epic work has been painstakingly and expertly realized in film, as only a gifted afficianado could. Tolkien's work was more than just a fantasy novel; it was based on linguistic research and entailed mythic and archetypal themes. Because of that it speaks to all who still allow their heart to speak to them. The film project required a sustained effort of proportions as fantastic as the subject matter; Peter Jackson is to be applauded for his vision and dedication. The three films should be seen as one work, which triptych will stand for all time as a monument to the ability of art to inform us of the wonders in the created Cosmos."
2,ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ,"I feel like I should love this movie due to all the praise, but I just don't. What's wrong with me?"
5,The best film ever!,"Even though it was one of the most anticipated movies for years, Peter Jackson didn't fail to impress the veiwers by sticking to the plot, and making it one the best fantasy films of all time. The acters were perfectly cast, Elijah Wood being the perfect Frodo Baggins. I was very happy with the film, it even led me to read the book! Im not even a book fan. Well done!"
3,3 hours for just 3 minutes of intense honesty at 2:39 thru 2:42,"At 2 hours and 39 minutes into this film, Clownface He/She-Orc gets his/her/its big scene with Sean Bean. It is absolutely truthful and precise about how great worth and bravery is WASTED on the battlefield to stem the Orc onslaught. If not for those three minutes, I would have completely written off this first film. I really find it exhausting and tedious EXCEPT for 2:39 through 2:42."
4,Great condition & timely arrival.,"Product did not arrive as originally advertized, but upon notification, seller sent the rest of the product. Everything came quickly and in a very good condition. Would purchase from seller again."
1,Terrible Resolution,The film is what it is. Flawed and overly long but kinda awesome none the less. I purchased the streaming version and it was basically unwatchable. The resolution was terrible. Very disappointing.
2,boring,"Though it had alot of action scenes, the character development was bad and they talked so fast in the beggining you couldn't tell what they were saying. Since you couldn't get into the characters, the overload of action scenes was hard to get into."
2,"Exceedingly silly, bombastic nonsense.","The whole time I was watching this, I expected the Monty Python crew from ""Holy Grail"" to pop out and say ""We are the knights who say nee!"" or ""Merely a flesh wound!"" I mean, this movie is just ridiculous, melodramatic nonsense. Granted, the set design is cool, but basic cinematic necessities - a coherent narrative, for example - are missing.... How these actors recited their preposterous lines without cracking up is beyond me. ...Two stars is being generous. Enjoy ""Two Towers,"" folks. I'll be in the next theater seeing something worth my time and money."
5,Well...there will never be a movie that will shadow this one,"OMIGOD!!!! This is the greatest movie of ALL TIME seriously, I absolutely adored it, and wowsa Elijah and Orlando are soooooooo gorgeous!!!! Oh baby the part where Frodo gets stabbed by a ringwraith had me sniffling to say the least! The orcs were really gross and Sauron really gave me the heebies! I thought Liv Tyler was great in her role, she really made the charactor 3 dimensional. Just please take my advice... Buy-the-movie."
1,Not Compatible With Windows XP,I know I may be in the minority but I watch DVD's on my computer.And I was highly disappointed when I discovered that this will not work on Windows XP even though the specs for this product saythat it should. I have done some research and have found out that I am not the only person with this problem. I know the movie is fantastic but I can not recommend this for XP users.
2,Too Long and Too Boring,"I read all the rave reviews and decided to see what all the hype was about. Sure it has some cool graphics and special effects, but I have to admit after the first 2 hours and 20 minutes I dosed off in the theatre. I woke up to see that the movie had no ending. You must see the sequels to find out what happens. Frankly, I don't think I could sit through 6 more hours of boredom to find out if some boy throws a ring into a volcano or not."
2,"""Fuzzier"" than the non-Blu-ray version.","Five stars for the film, but not for this Blu-ray release. I'm very disappointed with this Blu-ray release of Fellowship of the Ring. I thought with Blu-ray the picture would be sharper, but there is no improvement at all in definition or sharpness over the non-Blu-ray DVD format. If anything, the picture on my high definition 42 inch Blu-ray capable HDTV is worse. The battle scene at the very beginning, for instance, instead of approaching the crystal clarity of the theater version, was if anything inferior in resolution to the non-Blu-ray DVD of the same title."
3,Every few Years,"What a marketing scam! You can be sure that New Line will be issuing ""special"" ""limited"" ""once in a life time"" or whatever to pawn off the same old stuff. In five years you can expect the ""Special Limited Collector's 10 year anniversary edition: featuring six seconds of additional footage. You know they have a lot of footage just waiting for the new releases to come out. In one hundred years you can buy the special ten hour version of each film. You might say you heard it here first."
1,Not extended release! Again!,This is a second THEATRICAL bluray release on separate discs. Please compare the run time: theatrical is 178 minutes and extended is 208.
3,Well crafted but not for me,"Well crafted, acted and spectacularly filmed. I'm not much into fantasy and got bored but would highly recommend this movie for those who like the genre. This is my opinion on all three of the Lord of the Rings movies."
1,OVER rated,"This movie seemed promising for maybe the first half. Then it was boring... boring... boring... boring.... and finally ended with little or no resolution. I understand there are two other movies, but seriously after this one... no way! Also Helpful dating hint**** NOT A CHICK FLICK*****"
5,Awesome!,"This was undoubtedly the greatest movie that I have ever seen! Every thing about it was absolutely amazing. Some of the actors have, for the most part, have never been heard of, yet they delivered extremely good performances. Peter Jackson did a great job on the movie and only used special effects on what would enhance the movie, not detract from it. He also did not just enjoy playing around with the special effects, unlike a certain George Lucas. Another thing is the cinematography was excellent, and the scenery could not be paralleled. Yes, though Jackson could have includued more from the book, I am partially grateful he didn't, due to time reasons. If you have not yet seen the movie find a friend that has it or buy the movie! It is not a waste of money or time, despite what others say. This movie is simply amazing!"
5,The first in what will be the greatest movie trilogy ever.,This movie was a masterpiece. The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be the greatest movie trilogy ever.
4,nice set,"this is the better version to have.the extra scenes make the movie flow a little better and enhance the story. the extras are ok, but i really didnt care all that much about the progression from book to film, but for those who did, they'll like it. i never read the boks. with this as successful as it was im sure they'll bedoing this for the next 2 movies too.which means Im gonna have 12 discs for just 3 movies when all is said and done. Yikes"
4,the fellowship,"?I saw it in theaters. In theaters It was PG-13 now on vhs it's ""R"". Why? Yes the movie is violent in some ways but not enough to have an ""R"" rating. in the Mines it is very intense. Very scarry for little kids. the Real life Look of all the actors and the action is also scarry . But it is clear that Good is aginst Evil and that is a good thing. So is the movie changing ??? The rating system is not something I can count on. this was a good movie for a kid my age to see with my parents. If it was ""R"" I never would have got to see it. It is Intense. I have seen it 6 times now. it is one of my favorite movies. Now my Dad is concerned about what changes have been made. These are great books and great movies. Good Vs Bad. The Movie is like what it looks like in my imigination when my dad reads to me Just not as gory.... I would have never imagined the Green Ork blood.. GROSS."
5,Excellent Adaptation.,"The first time I saw Lord of the Rings, I must admit, it didn't do much for me at all. I found it to be a very long movie that wasn't extremely exciting. However upon viewing it the second time, I noticed how much better the film was when i watched it again. I overlooked the fact that it was a 3 hour long movie, and noticed how excellent the story was. The story being very simplistic leaves room for more exciting scenes as well as more exciting twists of the story. Although the movie doesn't fallow the book exactly, it is truly an excellent adaptation of it."
3,Worth the price,Movie was not in the best of shapes but it was worth the money I spent. The products case is primarily the bad part. Discs are ok.
5,"Finally, a Masterwork DVD","This is what the power of the DVD medium is all about. Peter Jackson and co. have utilized this format better than any other filmakers in the short history of DVD. This is a set for true fans of moviemaking. By the time you finish the endless hours of extras, you will be not only a fan of the film, but a fan of the filmakers as well, who pored so much heart and soul into the production of this instant classic. Highest possible recommendation."
5,Best Movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In my eyes, this movie is brillant. Wonderfully edited, with an amazing soundtrack(acutally Im listening to the soundtrack right now. Track #2 is pure bliss.). It is a movie I would recommend to all those wanting to get and meaningful movie, but im warning you all out comedy fans, It might be a miss in your opinion. There are several points of comedy but not enough to balance the whole movie. I took a comedy fan to see it and she hated it. Brillant acting by Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo Baggins, and he is not only cute, but has wonderful acting skills. I almost cried when he tried to save a certain member of the Fellowship (I wont name names for those who havent seen it.). He was overlooked by the Academy, but hey, there are two more movies. Oh and for all you people living under a rock, This is a trilogy, so dont get upset by the ending. I loved this action/adventure movie and im sure you will too."
5,The Fellowship of the Ring Rules Supreme,"Obviously, the books and one's imagination are the best ways to experience Tolkien's grand story. However, this movie is an excellent movie in and of itself, even if it contains some slight deviations from the book (*Cough* Tom Bombadil *Cough*). But, since it is so well done, even taking most of its lines straight from the book, and is based on the great story of Tolkien, I consider it one of the best movies of all time. The visual effects are some of the best ever. The acting is uncannily good for a ragtag bunch of fairly obscure actors (except two). In addition, it simply captures one's imagination, emotions, and excitement. See it many times. Buy the DVD."
4,"Overkill, but all part of the magical world","This was given to me as a Christmas present, and while initially glad to have it, I think it is mroe than most folks will ever want to sit down and watch. Yes, you get the movie, and it is, or course,fantastic, but the accompanying DVDs on the making of the movie would likely be watched only once or twice before you would stop seeing them. After all, it IS the movie that you want, and I doubt most folks would want to watch the movie and the 4 other discs each time they wanted to see the movie.Perhaps the nicest extra in the set is the bookends, since they are pretty nice if you are a fan of the movies, but this set more than anything will give you more than you ever wanted to know.On one more note- the free ticket to see the Two Towers expired as of New Year's 2003, so don't expect to be able to use it if you haven't already."
5,A must-have for any LotR fan!,"This has got to be one of the best DVD sets there are. To begin, the movie is just amazing. It follows very true to the book and the actors are all superb. I won't go into details about the movie because if you're wanting to buy this DVD set you've probably already seen the movie.This version includes the deleted scenes in the movie, making an even better story than what you saw in the theaters. But the best reason to buy this DVD set is because of the wonderful behind the scenes, extra 2 DVDs worth of commentary. This brings to life the making of the movie, which in itself is truly fascinating. You can see all the time and effort and creativity that went into creating the beautiful epic they've given all of us. It's definitely a labor of love."
3,Clearly one of the most overrated movies of our generation,"Great respect for Jackson for undertaking this but lets face it, this movie lacks an editor and is prone to long, agonizingly boring spurts. Same goes for the rest in the trilogy as well."
5,"A ""Precious"" Film!","I saw this movie at 12:01 AM the day it came out! At that time, I hadn't read the books, but now I'm an official member of the Lord of the Rings Cult. I've seen it three times, and it gets better each time. The first time I saw it, I cried through the whole thing. It's romantic and touching, yet thought-provoking and horrific at the same time. There's something for everybody in this movie, whether you like love or battles. It's the perfect balance between a chick-flick, a literary film, and a manly movie. The actors were AMAZING, and they fit the characters perfectly. Fans of the books, you won't be disappointed! The movie is a bit different from the novels, but overall it's very true to the characters, plots, and settings created by JRR Tolkien. If you want to witness something that will change your life forever, please check out The Fellowship of the Ring."
5,"""Rings"" Lords Over Special Effects Flix","""Lord of the Rings"" is painstakingly detailed, craftily filmed and expertly cast. This film is superior to any other special effects extravaganzas (eg. Star Wars) because of the love that went into the script rather than to its toy-tie-ins. The film demonstrates the importance of close relationships. It teaches us that pursuing goals despite the odds is the righteous path and so much more rewarding than backing down.Buy the DVD Extended version in WIDESCREEN format. There is much to keep discovering in this film classic!"
5,Movie Magic.,"What going to the movies, is all about.A mouth agape film.The kind of spectical that cinema was invented for.I'ts just not only a secial effects extraviganzer, and action flick.The scrpit is top notch and the suspence and wonder, build up , from the very first frame.This DVD is a must , for consumers young and old.Three hour's of sheer pleasure that goes all to quickly.I can't wait for the 4 disc version with an extra half hour ofscenes cut from the film.I'll still be purchasing this early edition too.Brill."
2,this review actually refers to the VHS...,"ok. i bought Lord of the Rings on VHS because the movie was magnificent and i did not at the time have a DVD player. Big mistake. The film to tape transfer is terrible and the special effects that in the film were vivid and realistic now look cheap and poorly done. The Riders in the scene with the water horses look like paper cut outs and even the opening sign that says ""Lord of the Rings"" looks like dull plastic. If you enjoyed to film for the special effects, do not buy this VHS tape. Maybe if you never saw it in the theater or on DVD you wouldn't notice, but overall it is not worth it. It's like they made the VHS crappy on purpose so people would buy the DVD. Now I have a DVD player, and Lord of the Rings on DVD, and am very pleased. But the VHS is a dulled down version that shames the intricacies of the creative process behind the film."
3,Annoying problems!,"Thus far I've only looked at the two disks containing the movie, not the two with additional material. But Disk 2 of the movie had two bad spots on it (in Chapters 10 and 14) that caused my DVD player to freeze. In each case I had to jump to the beginning of the next chapter, then spend a lot of time ""tinkering"" to see how much of the previous chapter I could view. (... If I'd bought it in a store I'd exchange it--but I can't imagine myself looking at the whole movie again any time soon, to check whether a replacement DVD was good! Purchasers shouldn't have to be concerned with such things.)I also have a complaint about the film itself: the end titles are too small to be read on a TV screen."
5,Excellent,"I finally saw this movie, a week after the second installment was released. I haven't read the books, so I was a bit reluctant to see the film without doing so first. I have to say I was stunned; I couldn't believe the epic scale of the film. The special effects and action sequences are amazing. However, many of the characters are very well-developed, particularly that of Frodo Baggins, played by Elijah Wood. Frodo's inner turmoil and the burden the title of ring-bearer places on him becomes more and more apparent as the film progresses. I personally became very attatched to the character of Frodo...I'm almost scared to see what becomes of him at the end of the final installment! But overall, highly reccomended!"
3,Movie fine...but,"The Movie is good, but I am a bit disappointed about the copy I received.Apparantly it can only be seen in countries with the area code 1 (like US), where I'm belong to the area code 2! So it give some issues, when wanting to see the movie."
5,a great extension for the lotr fan!!!,"I think that The Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite movie of all time, so I was very anxious to get my hands on the extended cut so I could delve a little more into Middle Earth. And it did not disappoint; these extended cuts showed a little more and of hardships of the hobbits and some more info about the fellowship. I think that people look at lotr and just see elves and orcs but lotr is so much more than that. Lotr is a beautiful story of how against all odds good ultimately conquores over darkness and that is why I love lotr so much."
1,Overrated...VERY Overrated.,"I read The Hobbit a few months ago, and I liked it. Then I got to The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring, and it totally bored me. Tolkein makes no sense at all in that book! So why is the movie so popular??? It's nothing more than a PG-13 version of Harry Potter! This has to be THE most overrated movie I have ever, ever seen in my life. I'm so tired of people saying, ""The Lord of the Rings is so awesome"" and ""I can't wait for the sequel!"" and other things like that. Please, people, realize that this movie [is bad]."
3,Too long and no ending,"Overall the movie was pretty good, although as another reviewer noted it gets a bit boring at times. It is just too long to not have an ending. I half expected ""To Be Continued..."" to scroll up the screen as the movie ended."
1,ONE STAR FOR NEW LINE..!!,"I'm rating one star for NEW LINE marketing strategy, not for the content of this movie, that is marvellous.The fact is that I live in Latin America, and NEW LINE will not release this special edition around here, due to fear tha sales will not make worth the costs.... What a shame.You must think: ""Why don't you import it?"" Well, the exhange-rate of the currency of my country, more the import taxs, in relation to dollar make it virtually impossible for me...Enjoy it, you that can do it...."
1,No way,Just wanted to add my 2 cents to this discussion....I can wait till 2015 if I have too.****2011 it was worth the wait 5 stars to the extended edition blu ray!
1,HOW BORING!!!!!!!!!,"This movie had to be one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. I did not care to see it in theaters and wasn't going to rent it but one of my friends said it was a good movie. So i rented it and I had to turn it off in the middle of the movie, it was so boring, the scenes werent moving I would have much rather watched Harry Potter which is way better than this geek movie. Save your money and buy/rent another movie!!!!"
2,Boring and highly overrated,"I thought that The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was incredibly boring and highly overrated. It seemed to drag on, and finally at the end, when the excitement comes, you learn that in order to find out what happens...you have to watch 6 more hours of the movie. The least Peter Jackson could've done would've been to give it a little more of an ending. Otherwise, it's like an open-ended waste of time. I recommend not wasting your time on this one."
2,Bland!,"This movie really lacked spice.A lot of pompous talking, interrupted by action scenes looking as if they were lifted from a computer game.An extremely lame and simple action scenes it were. F.ex. the scene where the elven girl races towards the river with Frodo. How does she succeed ? She just whispers a few spells to the horse and it outruns the pursuers. This may work in a novel, but in a movie you need a lot more twist and turns. Compare this horse race with the speeder chase in Return Of The Jedi. See what I mean ?What a shame, that such a classic work should suffer this fate.(2 stars for scenery though)"
1,*cough*,"I had great expectations for this movie, but then I saw it and found out it was not that great of a movie. The only scene I liked in this movie was the begining fight. The rest of the movie went too slow and boring. Frodo (Elijah Woods) had a constipated look through the whole film and was just bothering me. The dark riders had an annoying screech and the fight sequence between Gandalf and the evil wizard was cheap and disappointing. I hope/wish the next two will be better than this very disappointing start to the world of the lord of the rings."
3,Nice film but NOTHING like the book,"its a real nice film, but if you love the books don't wast your time here. theres nothing from the magic inside this film. its just the usual Hollywood slashing and SFX no more"
3,Why????,"No,no,no,no,no!! I was so psyched to get this dvd,then I put it in and there it was...Shot in that stupidwide screen format that to this very day I cannot understand!You end up with about 10 inches(high)of picture in the middleof the screen.Why?Why do they do this.I have a 27 inch t.v...darn..it,I want the whole thing full,I don't want a strip of black nothingness at the top and bottom of the screen!! That sucks,thanks alot you jerk(film makers)for ruining a greatmovie."
5,Possibly one of the best movies ever made!,"Truly a magnificent dedication to the work of Tolkien. Though he may have been just a little annoyed at the fact that his beloved elvish and hobbit poetry was dropped, I think he would be well pleased at how closely Peter Jackson has followed his story.The effects were so incredible that you didn;t even notice them and THAT's the hallmark of a great movie. Attack of the Clones would pale beside this!"
1,Don't buy this DVD if your playing it on a DVD-ROM,I purchased this movie with my hard earned money to find out that is does not work with 3 of the most used DVD-ROM's made. Now I have to wait for a patch just to watch this DVD. I've found several others who also have the same problem. Check Dell Computer Support Communities to find out if your DVD-ROM is one of the three. New Line Cinema should of thought of this before releasing the DVD. Unsatisfied customers are hard to please after problems. I really would like to watch the movie to rate it. I will never purchase a New Line Cinema DVD again.
1,great movie,Too bad the streaming was AWFUL! We were very disappointed. Amazon really should figure it out. Stream it from Netflix or get a DVD.
3,Video fine - is just not the Extended Edition,Received this rental free in purchasing the Blu Ray. The nice part of getting the free rental is that I could watch it while the Blu Ray was being shipped. Video streaming picture quality was fine but I cant verify if it was HD or not. Just be aware that this video is NOT the extended version of the film. My main gripe is with the description of the blu ray (which suggests it IS the extended version)- will address this when I review the blu ray purchase.
5,black friday,purchased this on black friday; definitely worth the money. waiting on sale for the other two. Great movie. Love every minute of it.
2,Wrong Item,"They sent me the wrong order. I recieve Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, but I bought Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring. I can't believe that they sent me the wrong movie:/"
1,This is a NEEDLESS release...,"This is an absolutely needless release, a release that only has one reason for being and one alone, to make you spend your money on it before the vastly superior extended versions are released separately. I kind of understood why they were separate when it came to the DVD versions, as neither the data capacity or features of Blu-ray were available at the time, making seamless branching impossible. That's NOT the case here. They could simply release both versions and have the extended bits added seamlessly depending on which version you pick (or if that's not feasible, just release it on a second disk). Instead, you'll end up paying for both yet again. Don't fall prey to it (your DVD version will suffice until a proper BD is released), unless of course you're the kind of person who thinks George Lucas is a generous guy for allowing you to buy 8 different versions of the same trilogy..."
5,excellent,"The fellowship of the ring is a fantastic cinematic event that outdoes that other fantasy filled movie running alongside it by far. Jacksons direction is perfect, the make-up and CG effects are stunning and above all, fantastic characters are lifted by some fabulous performances. I think that mainly Elijah wood and Ian Mckellen stand out a lot, but the breakthrough role will undoubtedly be Orlando Bloom as the Elvin archer Legolas.I give this film a five because it is undoubtedly one of the most epic and sweeping movies ever made, matched only by Braveheart for stunning battle sequences and all that we have come to expect from these sorts of movies.Well done Peter Jackson, i can feel George Lucas trembling from here."
3,nice 1/2 movie,"Great book, average movie only because in reading a book the pace is up to you...For a three hour movie relatively nothing happens during the first 90 min.! Fine that it follows the book, but a great book doesn't always make for a great movie. Although the movie was made fantastically, there is very little character development and, more importantly for me, very few of my emotions were titilated except for a little fear and anticipation by the 2 hour mark.Sorry, but Harry Potter translates (or is made) better into a movie than this one- the HP 3 hour roller coaster was by far more exhillerating than this 3 hour 'argonaut' version."
3,Tolkien reader,"I had the opportunity to see the movie last night. At first I was happy to see that the included enough about the Hobbit to let those who had never read the book understand the origin of the one ring. But the changes began early and for me they took away from the story those things which the author had intended to be points of change. Frodoe should have crossed the river alone, and it was the magic of Elron the brought the water against the Black riders. The Relationship between Strider and the Lady Aeowyn does not come until much later, and I don't see how it's addition does much for the movie other than putting an actor to work. People who read these books, read them more than once, and by doing so come to understand the story and focus on the pivotol points at which the story turns. This screenplay does not do justice to the origional book, but to the bank book of it's producers..."
1,VIOLENT!,"They took a good story line, and made the war scenes so intensely violent that young children in the audience were getting distressed by it, as was I and the group of adults I was with. Really over the top."
2,The Lord of the Rings,"This movie is highly overrated, too long, and boring.Sometimes you could hardly hear the actors because the music was too loud. I fail to see what's all the fuss it about.The special features DVD was better than the movie."
3,Hard to follow.,"I rented this for my 6 year-old boy. The story is a little hard to follow for his age. I've seen it before. I really didn't feel like watching it over his shoulder on the computer, so we let the rental expire."
2,Ok......Great Visual Effects but where's the movie??!??!,"Sure....I was spellbound by all the scenery and explosion. But, when you see a movie, don't you usually want a story with a plot and all those other literature terms??? With LOTR, I saw no story. Just some creatures tryin to get a ring to a mountain to destroy it. *cue sarcasm* Woo-freakin-hoo...with that plot, it's gotta be a masterpiece!!! *ends sarcasm* Oh well, atleast I got some nap time out of it."
1,"Buy the ""Extended Version""","I bought this DVD when it first came out in 2002 and then towards the holiday season of 2002 an ""Extended Version"" was released with around 30 minutes more added to the movie. Sure, the ""Extended Version"" costs more, but if you want to see more of the story then there's only one choice here, unfortunately. It would have been nice of the packaging commitee to include both the original theatrical version and the ""Extended Version"" in a single set (like E.T.) but then they would have lost making 2 sales to every fan. But now that the ""Extended Version"" and the ""Shortened Version"" are out, well, who wants the ""Shortened Version""? Buyer beware: there are 2 versions of this film available, this one is the short straw."
2,Not very original.,"Since there is so much interest in Tolkien and his Rings books, I thought this would have some important content. Wrong. The story seems to be largely derivative, taking themes and ideas from a variety of classic literature: Homer's Odessy, the Arthurian legends, the Biblical book of Ezekiel, etc. There wasn't even a clear reason for ending the first movie of the series where it did. Perhaps if the movie does not closely follow Tolkien the books might be better.As a movie, the action scenes are repetitive and dull, despite the excessively graphic carnage. The female characters are few and shallowly characterized, and the significance of the different groups of beings and their characteristics unclear, despite some explicit statements.Was it worth the price of admission? Yes, but it wasn't the exciting cinema I was expecting."
3,Bummed its not extended,We got this as a lightening deal. It was worth the savings but we will be giving it as a gift because the extended version offers so much more.
1,Extended edition In Spanish Not available in DVD,"This is a shame, again!!! I only buy DVDs and they dont have the decency to release this wonderful extended version for the three main languages in the USA and Canada : English, Spanish and French. Simply I don't understand movie business! It's an open discrimination to 25% of non-english speakers in both countries!"
3,Terribly over-rated,"Is this movie good?? Yes! Amazing...no.All this movie really has to offer is the scenery and good special effects. I'm sorry, but that doesn't make the movie. The acting was nothing special, some characters over-acted,it dragged on way to long, at some points it could be painfully boring.What I think happened is that all the uber-Tolkien fans were so excited and just couldn't wait for the release of this film, that when they saw it, they were in denial of how good it wasn't.This film beat out the Godfather in the top 250 list at imdb.com in the first weeks it came out...how?? This deserves at most 30th place."
1,2001?,"99% of these reviews are not for this product, some are from 2001! How is that possible?I'm not buying until the extended version comes out on Bluray."
5,Great Value/Outstanding DVD,"What a terrific value..5 discs, 2 statues, 3 unique cards and a free pass to the next LOTR's film. The additions were significant and worth watching, especially the Lothlorien segments. This is THE classic worth having in its Platinum Edition form."
4,"I have saw the preview. Good, But not great.","I saw the movie today, i went to a special preview event hold worldwide this day; and the movie was shown to all the sponsors.The movie i can say is good, it worth going to cinema for it.But it is too long, almost 3 hours long!!!!!The photograhy is incredible! the costumes, the effects, the sound. The theme is good, but sometimes is very slow and a little boring.I general, it is a good movie, not fantastic, but it is a good movie."
2,I just didn't like it...,"Granted, I'm not a big Sci-fi/Fantasy fan and have never read any of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, but I felt LOTR: FOTR was one big bore. The film moved slowly, perhaps setting it up for part II, but it was excruciating. I took a twenty minute bathroom break before allowing myself back into the theater, then I kept drifiting off to sleep. I realize I'm in the minority, but it I just did not like this film, AT ALL!!! One star for the cast and another for the visuals."
3,the books were better,"After seeing an early screening of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I can say I'm glad the films are being made, and I'm glad that I saw it. But it lacks the depth of the book, and messes around too much with the characters and storyline. Howard Shore's score is dreadful, another ripoff of Carl Orff. (What would these guys do without ""Carmina Burana""?) This time the chanting is in Elvish, but it's still a direct steal. So go see it, but be aware that it's not as faithful to Tolkien as it might -- and should -- have been."
3,Very long,"Lots of swords and arrows sticking into things, Christopher Lee looking like Rob Zombie, and some monsters with really awful dental work, but I can't seem to remember much else."
5,SPECTACULAR Film!!!,"""The Lord of the Rings"" is nothing short of a benchmark in modern cinema. Everything about the film oozes quality, talent and intelligence. Unlike the typical Hollywood ""Big Blockbuster of the Week,"" it isn't dumbed-down, cliched or sterile. Indeed, LotR seems to get almost everything right: action that is really exciting, breathtaking visuals, impressive acting across the board, genuine wit, engaging drama and even a smidgen of romance. Ignore the sniveling of the pathological Tolkien fans; Peter Jackson and company did a brilliant job of paring down the immense Lord of the Rings trilogy into a film of manageable length while keeping the essential spirit of the story intact. This is a film not just for fans of the books, or fantasy in general, but for anyone who can appreciate quality film-making. It was also great fun.The audience stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. Enough said."
5,Movielover,"This is the greatest movie ever made, with great actors and a terrific messagem it is a classic. Every household should own this movie, you will watch it over and over and each time see something greater in it than the last time."
5,what can i say...,"This was a wonderful film. It was everything I expected and more. To anyone who disliked this film, all I can say is get a life! The acting, direction and cinematography were great. I did have a few problems with the film such as:1.I'm sure Hugo Weaving is a fine actor, but his Elrond was dull.2.Did anyone notice that Legolas did not have many lines, he just stood around or fought, but I guess everyone was too busy drooling to notice (I'll admit Orlando Bloom is hot!)3.Cate Blanchett took Galandriel a little too extreme (but she was good anyway.)I enjoyed the rest of the film, and have to give props to Ian McKellan who was born to play Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen who IS Aragorn, and Sean Bean who not only gave an excellent potrayl of Boromir, but made him more likeable in the movie than in the book and I felt his performance was underrated by critcs and fans alike!"
5,own this wonderful dvd,"This is a wonderful addition to your dvd library if you love ""The Lord of The Rings"" - you've read the books and yes the movie doesn't follow it _exactly_ it's still the best adaptation so far and most likely will ever be. There are some great features this has and the special effects are impressive. It's absolutely fascinating to see how Elijah Woods plays his part so well. And Liv Tyler is great. It seems this cast is perfectly suited for this movie.Frodo lives."
5,Blow away movie!!!,"This movie was fantastic.It's my all time favorite movie.If you like Elijah Wood, this is a must see movie, or for anybody else who loves more adult fantasy. What i mean is that it is more violent and mature than Harry Potter the 1# movie.I can't complain of anything. It was perfect. Peter Jackson was very true to the book.Well don't take my word for it SEE it! I can't wait For the second movie to come out on December 25, 2002!"
4,"""Brian Hoven"" Gives it 3.5 thumbs up","Brian Hoven the God of all quest movies, has taken on what one might call an obsession with this movie. His love for wizards and hobits is endless. Being an expert that he is, as most already know, he states they(upcoming movies)can only get better.Brian Hoven is the King of the Shire."
5,This movie is awesome!!,This was definetely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life! BUY IT!!!!!! I can't wait for the next two to come out!
5,One of the best DVDs,"I viewed this last night on my big screen TV. I have a copy of the wide-screen version. This is simply an amazing DVD with great special effects, sounds and extra features.The cover says that there is an extra 30 minutes of scenes, which were difficult for me to find.Overall if you are a LOTR fan, then you should definitely get this DVD."
5,can't wait to see more,"I finally saw this movie when it came out to the local theatre. I've been a fan of the hobbit and lord of the rings since I was itty bitty when I first watched the animated movies. Now, being that I was more familar with the hobbit and the return of the king, I looked to this movie with interest as I had never known about the first two parts of the story. Even though I knew that certain characters would survive and what would happen to them, I was very worried about Frodo and his fellow men as they began their journey. The effects of this movie are amazing. I would have rather sat through an nine hour movie rather than ending abruptly but even I was getting restless. The movie doesn't include every aspect of the book but then it really would be too long. I must say, Peter Jackson has done a marvelous job and I can't wait to see the following two movies."
5,Best Movie,"That has absolutely got to be the best movie I've seen in my life. I've seen it twice in the theaters (not nearly enough times) and plan to see it AT LEAST once more before it leaves the theater, because it just won't be the same on video. Please, if you have not seen this movie- see it!"
5,My 3rd favorite movie!,"This movie is great! The acting, story, characters, special effects, everything! I highly recommend this movie to anyone! Watch it! I know you will love it!"
4,Subtitles,I would like to know why this DVD Special Edition don't have subtitles in any other language than english?
4,A Must-see!!!,"O.K...I'd give this movie a 4.5, but there's only a 4 and a 5, so...:) It only gets a 4 because it didn't follow the book. Otherwise, it was great. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It wasn't overly gory, and had a couple of funny scenes in it. I think it was a very well-done movie considering the complicted book."
5,eljah at his best,"this has to be one of elijahs best films ever! he is perfect for the part. the film is the best of the year, if not century!it really does bring the book to life. and its great, just great!!! and i think elijah wood is the sexiest man in the world!"
5,"Stunning, Brilliant, Outstanding - need I say more.","As my title says, best film ever, despite being 3 hours in length, left me wanting to see more. Bring on the next episode."
3,"Very good, but some problems....","The comforter is very warm, soft, but there is only one thing that I don't care for, some of feathers poke out and poke me when I sleep. Just something to get used to I guess."
2,"Keep Moving, Nothing to see here","I'm not going to lie - I bit on the price. But the old maxim ""You get what you pay for"" rings true here. This comforter is the opposite of soft; you can't feel the down. You can definitely feel the FEATHERS. So in short, if you like the feel of feathers (especially the feel of real QUILLS) this blanket is a winner! If you like the feel of soft, heavenly down, then avoid this like it's the bubonic plague."
2,Pretty Schwag,"The comforter was much thinner than I expected. Really, it is not that good of a down comforter."
1,misled,"I should have known, you get what you pay for. The comforter""s ""down "" quills are so course that they poke at the inside of the comforter's cover creating a hard lumpy surface to the touch and make the comforter very uncomfortable to lay on or under. I will never use it."
2,Expect more feathers than down!,Always remember that deals sounding to good to be true will often let you down. Expect more feathers than down with this blanket.
2,Cheap but poor quality,A white comforter with BIG brown feathers showing and sticking out is not so COMFORTABLE.
2,False advertising,"According to the tag, there is absolutely no down in these. You will get stuck by the feather quills. If you were looking for a luxurious down comforter, look elsewhere. If you were looking for a reasonably warm, clean, top blanket, and won't be too annoyed by the feathers this is worth paying a Jackson, but not much more."
2,Way too thin!!!!,"I bought this comforter in the King size. I originally wanted it because it was on sale for $20. When it arrived I couldn't believe how thin it was (maybe quarter of an inch thick)! This will be ok if you're looking for a thin comforter for ""off peak"" seasons but will definitely not do for winter (unless you live in Arizona or something). Was definitely disappointed."
5,Wiffle bats and Balls,This was EXACTLY what I wanted as a gift to my little leaguers. Product was delivered on time in perfect condition. Great seller.
5,Bachelor Party Mayhem,"What do fourteen 25-30 year olds want to do at a weekend bachelor party hosted at a rental cabin. Enjoy a few beverages and play some Wiffle ball of course! This is the classic design with the ""skinny"" bat and curvable Wiffle ball. Literally hours of fun, like going back to childhood. Make sure you get some extra balls and bases!"
2,no me parece adecuado para los pequenos,"el producto me parece que es muy largo para ninos pequenos, y no vale la pena comprarlo y enviarlo a vzla ya que sale muy costoso el envio a dicho pais"
2,good for flu bad for bowel movement,"I suffer from IBS and multiple food allergies (fructose, lactose, gluten, peanuts, beans and many others) I have a very strict diet only vegetables and light meat and a few non-glutenic cereals... I took these probiotics especially since it has a small amount of FOS ( less sugar) and I concluded that it has some good parts and bad parts- form me the bad parts are more prone than the good ones...I took it five times a day when I was with a flu and in less than 24 hours I was standing up as I was never feeling sick.... but in terms of colon movement I noticed no improvements....on the contrary ... I got to go out once a week ... although I normally diarrheic....for the gas and cramping, skin rash, etc... I can`t even tell..."
5,Life is a Cabaret!,"This is the next best thing to seeing Cabaret in studio 54! Pictures of the Roundabout theater production light up this book and tells the story of the revived new musical. This book does not tell the story of the Liza Minelli version, or any of the other Cabaret versions, but of that of the revival. I have seen the new production in person, and can only say that this is the next best thing...and the book even has the whole libretto in it!"
5,Great Book for a Great Musical,"""Cabaret"" is the best musical of all time, the revival the best version of the musical yet. The overall effect of this book is quite astonishing. Great pictures, text, and illustrations. Perfect execution. This is an incredible momento for everyone who loves the musical as much as I do. Bravo."
3,"good for you, but taste bad","the stuff tastes feel bad, but I'm sure its very healthy. i put it in my cereal and salads. yesterday i tried just swallowing it with water so to get the heath benefits but not having to taste it, i think I'll continue this way"
4,Excellent reference book for all Skew problems,It provides the practicing circuit designer with a clearly detailed tutorial and an insightful summary of the most recent literature on critical clock skew problems.
2,"Okay, not great--- or even good.","This book was just okay.It's a book of essays ""written by"" the characters of Meg Cabot's ever popular Princess Diaries series. I liked the ""Random Act of Princess"" parts. This is advice that can be followed, and I really appreciated it.The light gray writing is irritating. I know that it's supposed to be the light pink, like in the print edition, but I don't have a copy in print. I have the Kindle edition. I don't want to strain my eyes reading light gray type."
2,Unexpected,"I expected this book to be about Mia Thermopolis and her princessness but it's just a non-fiction book about royalty role-models. It's good if you like that sort of stuff, but I don't so that's why I gave it 2 stars."
2,A Review for Sandison's Che Guevara,"Mr. Sandison's book about Ernesto Che Guevara gave much to the reader as far as wonderful photographs are concerned, one even hangs on my wall. Why, then, would he publish a book that contains many grammatical errors and even some factual ones as well? At least I have a nice picture to look at while I ponder this question."
5,CHE GUEVARA - REVOLUTIONARY AND ICON,"I AM 13 YEARS OLD AND HAVE READ THREE BOOKS ON CHE GUEVARA AND HE REMAINS THE LEGEND THAT WAS CREATED QUICKLY IN HIS SHORT LIFE TIME . I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE , ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHO HE IS , AND TO THOSE THAT DO . KEEP THE SPIRIT ALIVE - KEEP THE SPARK BURNING ."
2,Not very interesting,I bought this for my 7 and 9 yrs old daughters. They usually love mystery and detective theme books and games. They didn't like this because the mysteries are either too basic or require knowledges they do not know. One rated it 1 star and the other rated it 3 star.
3,I'm disappointed.,"I didn't think the cards were very interesting. They toss in a bit of Mexican trivia now and then, which adds slight educational value. Many of the mysteries are either extremely basic or require knowledge the typical child would not have.I'm not sure why this is in a card format. It's actually a continuous storyline that would make way more sense as a book.This is one of those times I wish I had looked before buying."
3,Bella is bi-lingual...,...my child is not. I got this as a gift so my 10 year old daughter (not a reading fan) could have a reading/thinking game to play instead of her 20 minutes of required after school reading a couple of times a week. I didn't realize Bella was bi-lingual. This isn't a problem if my 2 older girls or her dad and I are playing with her but my 10 yr old isn't reading at grade level. She wasn't quite ready for the hispanic names and such. This tends to fluster her and she'll miss the entire point of the story. It's still good reasoning practice for her when she understands the senerios. It's just not a good game for kids that are not already good at reasoning and reading. It's an okay game for everyone to play together. She really likes it. I just really wanted something to get her interested in reading to help her catch up and this was not it since she can't play it alone.
3,Ok,I thought my Nancy Drew lover would be excited about this game. She liked it but did not love it as I hoped that she would. The mystery is always in matching the right gifts to the right child.
4,"Short, fun, and portable","My 9 year old daughter got this for Christmas and enjoyed reading each card. They are short, so you can do one mystery in just a few minutes."
2,Very slow and Poor heat,"Love the idea of this, but I agree with other negative reviews that say the grill takes forever to cook anything, even a pre-cooked sausage due to it not getting very hot (even on the highest setting). I will be donating this to the local goodwill and going with a grillpan for the stove instead."
1,Bad Experience,"Based on all the good reviews, I ordered the product and was very disappointed at the results, which were just the opposite of all the good reviews. The water in the botton tray tends to boil rather create a grilled food. Further, it is hard to clean. I returned the product at a loss because of the shipping cost incurred. I purchased a skillet with ridges and an easy clean surface. Now I have the excellent results written about in the good reviews. I suggest you do the same and you will not only be happy but save money too!"
4,new grill,The grill does exactly as stated....makes a really good steak and grilled onions. Washes up easily. I am happy with the use and purchase price. Thanks Juanita
5,Purchase of West Bend grill.,Purchased the grill through Amazon at good price and was complety satisfied with The Grill and purchased. The grill works perfect and cleans up in dishwasher.
2,Not worth keeping,"I was excited to receive the grill so I could change my cooking methods and try to eat a healthier diet. The meat I cooked came out well, but the cleaning was worse than anticipated. It was too much of a hassle to clean in all those spaces. I expected it to be much easier to clean. I sent it back."
5,loved it a must buy ***** :) i give it FIVE STARS,"loved it a must buy ***** :) i give it FIVE STARS works great, heats fast, strong,i replace my stove because grilling is better and its eazy to clean."
4,Nice product,"Easy to use and clean up, but kind of big to leave out on the counter if you have limited space."
5,The best so far,This is my third electric grill and the best so far. I use it atleast once a week and the food always comes out right. I like the fact that it has a drip tray that accumulates all the fat and that it comes with a lid.
5,Awesome grill for the money,"I've only used my new grill one time for grilling center-cut pork chops and grilled veggies on the flat side of the grill. They were the best pork chops we've ever grilled, including those grilled on our BBQ. They were very moist, they did not stick, and the veggies were done at the same time the meat was. The grill was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews. The heating element is built into the bottom of the grill itself, therefore, it gets very hot. The water reservoir made for easy clean-up and the grill itself was simple to clean. The grill is large, but I found a place for it even in the RV in which we live and travel full-time. I will no longer be forced to carry an outside grill and propane bottle. We plan to use this new grill instead. I highly recommend this grill, and I assure you it will not disappoint you. It provides great value for the money, and I usually purchase high-end products."
5,Great Indoor Grill,"I have used this grill for a couple of weeks and love it. Add water to the drip pan and it will keep your meat and veggies moist and tender. I have cooked chicken, pork chops and burgers. The chicken and burgers came out really tender and moist. Pork chops (boneless) were not as tender. No smoke at all. Clean up is rather easy. Great product."
4,Comes in handy.....,I live in an apartment complex and not able to grill on the balcony. The taste is not the same as outdoor grilling but great to have on hand for healthy preparations of food.Cleaning the grill is the only downside it's hard to get in between the grates and I haven't found a soft bristle brush which would be extremely helpful.Overall very happy with my purchase and would recommend.
5,6111 Heart Smart Indoor Grill,I have really enjoyed this product. I use it quite often and it's easy to use and gives a great source of low fat cooking. Clean up is easy and plenty of space on the grill. Great price for a indoor grill.
1,"off and on button switching constantly, not possible to grill properly","On and off button switching constantly, cooling off meat and grilling process is prolonged.. Meat doesn't not taste as grilled , more like cooked..Don't like it.."
2,Can't Clean It,"I love the grill. Love how it cooks and the size. But you can't clean it. It quickly loses its non-stick properties, too, so I had to replace it soon after I got it."
4,Summer in the Winter,This will make you have a picnic indoors even if it is 30 degrees outside. It is easy to use and easy to clean.
1,No luck for me,"Based on previous buyers, I ordered it;Well, damaged one was arrived; returned it & got the replacement;Guess what? the replacement was also damaged;This time, I asked for a refund.Looks like the company did not do the inspection.A good thing is that [...] customer service was good;"
2,Not what I thought it was...,I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least; it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product. It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets.
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"doesnt get hot enoughdoesnt cook the food completelythe food does not taste like grilled !!!my oven , or my small toaster oven does a better job !!!probably wont use it again , and it will dust in my kitchen !!!! waste :-("
3,Good machine,This is a good grill because of the lid. Most indoor grills do not have lids.The only thing I do not like is that it is hard to clean by hand because of the small holes in the gill plate.It has to be put in the dish washer.
4,Compared to G.Foreman grill,"Dropped my G.Foreman with removeable grill plates and adjustable temps/timer....was looking for best price for replacement when I found reviews for the Westbend. Only disappointments with G.F. was that I couldn't grill thick or bone-in cuts and that one side cooked faster than other so I still had to turn things over.The Westbend seemed like the perfect answer to that and I do believe it does a good job with grill marks, no smoking, thicker or bone-in cuts. My only disappointment would be that the temp. only goes up to 375 so things do take longer as another reviewer said and I have to grill nearly everything on High.No issues with cleaning as a few have mentioned...maybe they don't immerse one end in hot, soapy water? That dislodges occasional, overcooked, stuck-on stuff underneath and a nylon scrubber or old toothbrush finishes the job."
3,OK alternative to the normal grill,"I, like others did a ton on research before purchasing this model. I live in a condo where an outdoor grill is not really an option and I also have a glass cooktop so I cannot use a grill pan. The no smoke thing was key for me because my smoke detector is right outside my kitchen and always goes off. So let me break it down.What I like:Gives you those dark grill lines that you are looking for.Non stick coating stops sticking.Easy to useNo smokingWhat I don't like:As others side, I wish it got a bit hotter a bit quicker.Large and therefore difficult to store with all the pieces.The grill is hard to clean between the grates.Lid could be taller, it sits on top and touches some meats, not very sanitary.Overall 3 stars for serving my purpose, but really not used too often. Probably the best you can expect from an electric grill."
5,As Good As Any,"I bought the Sanyo 200 in knowing it had no top. When I realized I needed one I snapped this puppy up at a short-lived $45. Who needs an indoor grill that splatters? I may as well use the grill plate that covers 2 burners (now relegated to an outdoor 2-burner gas stove and a 2-burner electric plate used on the patio). Cooking for one most of the time the smaller grilling space wasn't an issue. But keeping the food covered with a see-thru top is, tho this one isn't a tight fit and must be carefully placed. But buying a heat-keeping aluminum baking pan to cover the Sanyo would've been cost-prohibitive. Plus the flat edge is handy for non-meat foods. No smoke, little odor, easy enough to clean- so what's not to like? Yeah, well it takes up space & I can't park stuff on it when not in use like the Sanyo, but so what? The Sanyo I'll give away."
4,Glad I decided to buy this one!,"Perfect for those rainy nights when grilling outside isn't an option! Easyclean up, too!"
3,Could be hotter,"Cooks veggies and other foods that dont require very high heat great! However, when cooking burgers and steaks I think it doesnt quite get hot enough for a good searing job."
4,Great for kid's rooms,"It was received promptly and packed well, however a few scratches on some of the metal bars but as these are hidden it was no big deal. Instructions were quite easy to follow although there were lots of screws!!! It fits great in my kid's room as it is not quite a double but ample for one sleeper (even adult). I would not recommend sleeping on it long-term as the mattress is quite thin. Colour is great and true to the picture. My only gripe would be that there are not enough ties to tie it to the metal frame so when you sit down, it slides quite easy. The fabric is removable which is a plus for messy kids!!!! All in all, am happy with it for the purpose I intended- somewhere to sit and read at night and an occasional sleep-over."
4,Music Good... Sing-along bad...,"Dasboard has got to be one of my favorite bands ever. This CD is awesome, merely because it came with the Bonus DVD of the entire MTV Unplugged Television show. Other than that... It's incredibly annoying how the entire studio sings along... really badly might I add. It's different when you're at the concert you HAVE TO sing along... but I mean come on... I'm not paying to hear some no-name concert goer to sing. Overall... only fans should buy this... you might as well buy The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most and Swiss Army Romance... Same songs... and just Chris's sweet and wonderful voice..."
3,screaming fans,"this was the first dashboard confessional cd i bought. i should have bought the actual cd first though, because i don't really know the songs, so the screaming fans i hear didn't help me learn the lyrics or even the tune. i've only listened to the cd once. ya they are really good, but sometimes the fans totally take over-so if you are looking to buy this cd to sing with-don't. but if you like all the noise in the song go ahead."
5,everyone here doesn't know what they're talking about,all the bad reviews are from people who aren't fans of dashboard...or dont understand what dashboard is about...chris's concerts have always been participatory with the crowd....that's exactly how he wanted it...all his live songs are better and have more feeling than the studio magic recordings do.....chris is an amazing amazing songwriter....his lyrics are so deep and meaningful....i can see how his music can make people cry...he really pours out his heart on stage...now without further adue BUY THE EFFIN CD!
2,"Good songs, poor recording","I love Dashboard as much as the next person, but the unplugged album is the exception. Sure it has a great song list and it's great that it comes with a DVD. But Chris doesn't sing for nearly half of the show, he simply lets the audience sing for him. If I wanted to hear a bunch of kids singing Dashboard songs, I would get a group of my friends together for a sing along. This album is very heartfelt. You can almost feel his pain as he sings. But I would not waste the money unless you don't mind the tracks being clouded up with a bunch of kids in the background, sometimes singing half the song."
1,readings from a junior high diary,"Dashboard Confessional is easily one of the most vomit enducing ""artists"" out now. This is music for 12 year olds who have never heard of Elliott Smith with relationship problems. Buy this if you want to hear the audience sing all of the parts he can't sing."
2,Don't buy this unless you enjoy audience background vocals,"This album might be good if it weren't for the ten teenagers singing in the background very loudly almost the entire time. I don't know a whole lot about Dashboard Confessional, but I liked a couple of their songs and wanted to check them out. The store was sold out of their studio album, so I bought this instead. Sometimes an unplugged album is a gem, but definitley not this one. I would only recommend this to a die hard fan who is willing to suffer the pain of the background vocals in order to hear the short patches of the actual band without teenage vocal support."
3,the 'background' vocals begin to grate.,"this is not a bad live performance. it is mixed well for the most part, decent (but not perfect) vocals, and there is tight instrumentation. some of the piano parts should have been brought up in the mix, but other than that, it sounds good.the only problem, and it is a terribly annoying one, is the crowd vocals. yes, i've read an interview or two with chris where he says something to the effect that the audience is as much a part of the band as he is. the audience seems to sing all of the words to one song and then none of the next (interestingly enough, the songs that have very little or no bgv's are the ones from his first and less comerically popular release 'the swiss army romance').if you can stand the crowd vocals, then this is for you. and at this price, it's a good buy for the cd/dvd combo."
4,Great - if you don't mind audience singalong...,"Okay, I'll start this off by saying I'm not the biggest fan - All I've got is Places... and the track Hands Down (pure beauty...), but I have seen them live at Reading, and I was eagerly looking forward to this release (although Dashboard Confessional unplugged seems a little... pointless. Aren't they always unplugged).I was rewarded - it's filled with brilliant versions of some of my favourite DC songs, plus it also has some ones I've never heard before. The sounds is great, the band is on fine form (I've never heard the drummer play as fast as he does in Hands Down!), and Chris is emotional and excellent.However, the audience are not all professional singers, and they can be drowning out Chris at some points, which, while providing ambience, can detract from the songs a little.On the whole though, cracking, and with the DVD - definitely worth it."
4,Insanely good as expected,"First off- Dashboard Confessional is one of my favorite bands along with some harder rock bands. This CD/DVD is probobly my second favorite concert DVD. The reason why it is in second? Because i certainly did not enjoy the people background singing. That is the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, the Singing is loud at times and in my opinion partially wrecks the song. Not totally wrecked or anything, but it would be a lot better with the lead singer/guitarist only singing and not the audience.overall very good"
2,Psuedo Emo Teen Singalong,"If I wanted to hear a bunch of heartbroken teens singing Dashboard Confessional I would go to an ""emo"" Karaoke night.I could not even get through the whole CD, and this purchase will be sold at my local second hand store without even removing the DVD extra.I like Dashboard Confessional, and I think this Unpugged would be great, if I could actually hear Chris Carrabba sing. I don't want to hear the extras from TRL whine along like they are in high school glee club.If you want TRL meets ""EMO"" buy this unplugged. If not purchase another Dashboard Confessional CD."
2,haha it's a cult!!,"Yeah so we already know the music is quite terrible, but how about the actual live performance. People just stare at this guy like he is god and none of them are over 15 and it's really quite funny and frightening at the same time. He has his own teenage army. I mean I don't think any of them blinked throughout the show. Basically it was a bunch of zombies watching and singing along to every word. I guess it deserves 2 stars simply for the fact that it has the live show which is really entertaining to watch as long as you turn the sound down real low. Give it enough sound so you can still hear the kids chanting along in the background. It makes it all worth it."
5,Stop bitching - it is a LIVE DC ALBUM!,"I have read plenty of reviews preceeding mine, whining about the level of background singing on this CD/DVD. At first i thought this might put me off, but upon listening to it, i found it quite refreshing to hear the participation of the fans. This is a live recording, and as such, crowd participation is meant to be encouraged. The MTV crowd is so enthusiastic that it is addictive. I am glad that they don't just clap and cheer at the end of each song; that would make it sound like every other live cd going around. The studio albums are there for crystal clear versions, this is not just some DC album with alternate versions of their own songs. It does not sound perfect, but that is exactly what i like about it! It is the truth, and isn't that why we all like DC in the first place?"
2,I don't understand...,"I wanted to hear Dashboard and instead I get a bunch of idiots singing instead? It doesn't seem much, but I wasted [...] on this cd. I should have bought new strings for my guitar. At least then I wouldn't have to listen to these idiots screaming the songs. I hate this and the DVD is even worse because then you have to see all these rich idiot kids playing extra sad for the cameras??? WTF Dashboard? MTV Sucks!"
3,Not what you expected but not bad either,"I preordered this cd as soon as I learned of its release. Excellent sound quality as can be expected from MTV unplugged. Incredible setlist and some really great renditions: remember to breath, living in your letters, so impossible. Almost a perfect album but I have to agree with other reviews that the throng of teeny boppers really bring this show down. Watching the bonus dvd and all the chubby adolescent girls singing with the ignorance that they're contributing something special made me sick. Don't get me wrong I like this album but its only because I'm a big dashboard fan. Final verdict: a great cd stained by teeny boppers."
2,LET THE MAN SING,"LET THE MAN SING! Icredit though, it did turn me on to DC but can't the crowd just shut the F$%& up!"
1,MTV did a job here,"I mean how lame can MTV make Dashboard look? Well they did a good job here. Which was better, the meat-head football player in the background actually sobbing during ""The Best Deceptions"" or his best friend belting out ""YOUR HAIR IS EVERYWHERE"" with his right fist in the air? The only redeeming quality...Mike Marsh on drums is a genius."
1,DON'T BUY IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SINGING ALONG!!!,"I am a big DC fan, but when I listened to this cd I could only listen to about a couple of songs. The cd is good but the whole time people are singing as loud as they can and it is very irritating. I will say that it is a good price for a cd and dvd, and the dvd is pretty good. I saw DC live not to long ago and it was amazing. People did sing at the show I was at, but this cd seems like the audiences singing covers Chris'. I meet Chris and the band, and Rhett Miller at the hotel they were staying at and they were the coolest guys. But a message to the fans of DC: ""Quite singing along so loud, I didn't come to hear you sing!!""."
5,Fantastic,"One of the bests things to do when youre alone or with someone u like........ its also good to see with friends....... excelent songs........ excellent show, excelent crowd even...... 5 stars of course......"
5,Say What Karaoke?!,"OH no, it's just MTV Unplugged...my mistake. Well anyways, this CD is pretty good except for the crowd singing a long, however I guess the singing helps you be in with the crowd and stuff. I would definitely recommend this to a Dashboard Confessional fan or someone that just wants to sing a long."
5,Dashboard Unpulgged,"This is one of the best albums that I have heard in a while. From the first second I put it on, I feel in love with it. In every song, you can feel the emotion behind it, and you just want to sing along with it. Which the crowd do, and it is fantastic to hear them. And with the live band, its even more special.A fantastic album, form a fantastic group"
1,Audience Unplugged,"I love Dashboard Confessional, but I hated this album. Most every song consists of the audience singing. If I wanted some untalented people singing, I would have recorded these songs myself. As far as I am concerned, this album should be called ""Audience Unplugged"""
4,"Not perfect, but good for the fans","No, this isn't what you'd call the greatest live album ever, but for diehard fans of d/c, you can't go wrong. features songs from places you've come to fear the most and swiss army romance, plus the song hands down from the newer album a mark a mission a brand a scar. Overall, its a good effort, and the live DvD is an added bonus as well. Just don't pay more than 20 bucks for it and you'll be fine..."
2,Real Great,This particular dashboard offering is real great if you're looking to here a hundred or so fools that you've never met sing a bunch of Carrabba's songs while he plays the guitar lines. If you want to here a good live recording of some of your favorite dashboard confessional songs then it's real [bad].
5,Absolutley Love,This is a good book for beginner readers. My 4yr old love this book so much he is literally reading from muscle memory. Great short read for bedtime when asked for that one more book plea.
3,Yaeh right,"Which one should lay the rythm - drummer or a guitarist. There are clear difficulties from Yngwies part to follow the drummer. Very bad. Singers voice is terrible. Ok he can reach all the high notes but thats it. The songs are otherwice well structured and the solos are kept ""short"" which is not so common for Yngwie. Not so good as Malmsteens 3 first recordings or Magnum Opus but still a good guitar album."
4,great album,"Album ini antara album terbaik di hasilkan oleh yngwie, dengan susunan lagu, sound rec,lagu yang heavy & raw.lagu-lagu heavy malmsteen di era 90'lebih bermelody berbanding dengan sekarang.Walaupun banyak lagu heavy, tapi kurang variasi!"
1,Thin but not durable.,"Cover ripped after a month of gentle use. The two straps are very thin where the phone flips closed. No issues with the seller, but won't buy product again."
2,Not focused,"Big Sizzla fan so it hurts me to say that I was very disappointed with this Sizzla collection. I enjoy Sizzla and his deep rasta thoughts. I can usually throw a Sizzla cd on and run for many miles in the california sun, but not this time. Usually Sizzla inspires, but not this time. The sound quality is poor on the recording and the jams are a weak. Two strong jams out of 14 is not good. I m keeping the cd only because I really liked ""Were the ones"" / ""Destroy the Wicked"". The good thing with Sizzla is that we know a new CD is just around the corner so Ill be waiting and so should you."
1,"Re-Release of ""Victim of Love""","A word to the wise: I purchased this for my wife's Pierce Brosnan collection only to discover that it is a re-titled re-release of ""Victim of Love"", which we already owned on DVD. Buyer beware: two versions of the same DVD are being listed for sale simultaneously under different titles and packaging without any disclosure of the duplicate content."
4,"Steamy, Hot Movie","I was not expecting a good movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend this movie. Pierce Bronson is sexy and so is Jo Beth Williams. A real thriller-under-rated."
2,TOO MANY TWISTS CAN SPOIL THE PRETZEL,"Is dashing Pierce Brosnan a wife murderer?Is he a manipulative cad? Is he telling the truth or is Virginia Madsen? And why is an average looking Jobeth Williams such a desired commodity for Brosnan?These and many other questions are left unanswered in this made for TV dud. The script tries to be Hitchcockian in its many twists, but Hitch knew how to make those twists convincing, whereas the writers of RAW HEAT merely hoped for any similarities. Williams as a shrink does a real no-no in revealing something a client told her in confidence; she also vacillates back and forth in trying to assess Brosnan's duplicity, and the end is so uh-oh, what have I done, it makes no sense. And who really killed Brosnan's wife?Brosnan is an automaton, capitalizing on his suave looks, and Madsen shows some of the talent that would eventually lead to her Oscar nominated performance in SIDEWAYS. But RAW HEAT is DEAD COLD in my book."
1,victim of plagiarism,"This wanna-be Hitchcockian thriller shamelessly rips off scenes from Vertigo, Psycho, and North by Northwest, with the music of Richard Stone imitation Bernard Herrmann via Pino Donaggio. Psychologist Jobeth Williams is dating Pierce Brosnan, the same man who it turns out is also dating her patient, Virginia Madsen. Or is he? The time it takes Jobeth to realise such a faux pas makes her seem rather dim, though she appears to be preoccupied in showing how she thinks she can do sexy. It is unfortunate that her (many!) love scenes with Pierce play so awkwardly, though having Pierce recite Edgar Allan Poe badly doesn't help. Madsen probably comes off best. She manages to invest emotion and truth in what is a cliche role of the woman scorned. Jobeth has some tiny moments, particularly with her friend played by the baritone-voiced Georgia Brown. Director Jerry London gives us a juggling clown to represent Jobeth's confusion, and rain to accompany Billie Holiday singing Stormy Weather."
3,Twisted,I thought it had great apeal. Very twisted turn of events that keep you hanging and guessing.
2,Some objectivity needed,"There's a good book to be written about the 1998 U.S. women's hockey team -- too bad Turco wasn't the one to write it. This is the most ""fawning"" text I think I've ever read. Everyone is strong, heroic, intelligent, beautiful, etc. A realistic telling of the story would have been quite enough; the embellishments only call into question the author's credibility. This would be good for teens who need a bit of an ego boost; otherwise, this was disappointing."
4,Better written but.....,"This book was better written than the first of the series. The scenes seemed to flow smoother than in the first one. However, certain characters keep getting on my nerves (Spinner and Alyline most of all). Yet, that's a sign of excellent characterization on the author's part.So overall, the author did a wonderful job with book 2!"
4,Very nice...easy to use:),"I think the Microsoft Zune is a cool MP3 player. The only reason why I only give it four stars is beacuse it is not touch screen...All in all, it is a good buy."
1,NO ITEM - ORDER CANCELLED BY VENDOR,"I cannot give a product review for the Microsoft Zune because about 4 days after I ordered the product, the vendor cancelled the order. I called the number listed in the email and they offered to send it to me for $199.00 instead of the $99.00 original posted price. I declined."
4,30 GB ZUNE,"Ithe Zune in late 2007 as a replacement for a 1 gb and aside from the thickness and weight, I'v been very happy with it. The software is easy to use, unlike some readers, I'm very happy with the headphones, and I especially like the built in FM tuner. Its harder to find accessories for the Zune products , but the Belkin clear acrylic case is really protective, the Altec Lansing IM 414 is a nice radio unit, but if you can find a M604 Altec Lansing speaker system, buy it. It has 65 watts per channel and comes with a remote. Overall, I am really glad I purchased the Zune over the Ipod."
4,Microsoft Zune,"WARNING: DON'T PURCHASE ZUNE IF YOU ARE RUNNING WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER 2003!I made this horrible mistake and soon realized that Microsoft has zero compatibility of the Zune to this OS and you need the software for it to work. Other than that, it's been working fine, a little bulky and cumbesome but I knew that going into it. It sounds great and the battery life is pretty good too."
4,Mixed feelings,"1. The initial setup is tooooo slow, but after is up and running it works really good.2. The synchronization is AWESOME, different than Ipod where all things need to be sync every single time Zune updates the device info and is very quick.3. Cannot be used as a portable hard drive. :(4. I purchased music in my office as a guest and I haven't found a way to get to my home where I have Zune set up permanently, therefore I have to separated music libraries (I also tried importing then trough a USB like I do with my Ipod and could not be done).5. No videos in marketplace.6. I am in Puerto Rico and the marketplace will not accept ANY credit card that doesn't have a US address, therefore you need to buy Zune pass prepaid cards in order to buy music and it's a hassle to go to the store every time you run out of points.Overall I like Zune more than the Ipod because it is more user friendly."
3,Zune : Need lots of updates to beat is counter parts,"When you are think of Zune or iPod go for iPodZune has good large screen, FM and much better battery life than ipod 30gbipod is way head in the usibility and the shock proctection is much better I have dropped my ipod many time its still goes on and on.Features lacked compared IpodZune cannot be used to copy data from your PCZune doesnt have screen lock protectionCalender is missingAnd offcourse the touch menu is amazing in ipod.I would rate this product 3 but no where near Ipod.Recent update: July 17th 2007I hardly used not more than 8 time in 9 months but fully charged Zune goes down in 30 min while playing vedio but my ipod lasts much better despite its almost 1.4 years"
1,"DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT","I bought the Zune about a 1 1/2 ago. I have had non-stop issues with this thing. I had it repaired already twice. The support sucks, or even if you want to say support. There music selection to buy in their marketplace is a joke. I literally have had non-stop problems with this thing. I got it cause i did not want to sell-out to the Apple take-over of every product on the plant. But it seems I'm going to have to get an i-pod cause this thing is better used as a paperweight.Do yourself a favor and do not buy any Zune product. You will save yourself a lot of headache and money!!!!!"
2,ERROR CODES!!!,"hello,let me start by saying this is not a diss on ZUNE or the person who sold it to me. Now that all the formal stuff is out the way let's get to the point.1) i cant stand the error codes i keep getting when i try to load an album or song from my collection. bogus big time and then that crappy (!) that you click on and all it say's is get more credit or, file is a different format and needs to change.all im asking for is a simple devise non Ipod and some ease when using it, i shouldn't have to struggle with error codes or reformatting my music to include connection errors, outside not being able to load the albums i want the most, i would say it's a good piece of gear!"
5,30G Zune,"I had one previously, but it died, and the new one is even better than the original model/ Price was great and ease of use was a cinch."
4,Excellent sound and picture quality,Excellent picture and sound quality. So worth the money. Easy to use.The sound is better than any MP plauer i have heard. The picture is clear and I would say it is as clear as a TV.
5,Zune 35gb,Excellent product and better than Ipod for podcasts because it has a better fast forward function. (I don't use it for music but it should be great). I had a 35gb Ipod and gave it to my grandchildren to get rid of it.
1,Unhappy,"Not only did I find this wouldn't install on one of my PCs, since installing it on the second I've had problems with the device not being recognised. I'm not an iPod owner so I've no idea if it's better or worse than one of those but so far the experience with my Zune has been poor.What sold it for me actually was the idea that I could share my songs, even if only to be played three times but I'm finding that that it's only specific songs I can share and there's no immediate way of telling which ones they are.I don't mind the look of it so much and the interface seems nice enough but for me it has to be easy to use and my experience so far is that it isn't. I'll probably return it."
3,Kinda bummy.....,"This was my first mp3 and I really liked it at first until it started freezing on me. One time I charged it all morning and unplugged it several hours later. I tried to turn it on but it wouldn't work. It has done this a lot! The battery life isn't too bad but sometimes right after you charge it, it goes dead. Kinda wierd...But besides that, it's very simple to use. It's really bulky and heavy. I got it instead of the ipod because of the price. I wish I had just spent the extra money and gotten one. If you're not sure on what to buy, I would suggest an ipod. They're more reliable plus there are more accessories for an ipod."
4,Zune,"the product delivers what i expected it to. very nice, i dont mind the color it took awhile though. it was the cheapest (and i am a cheap person). so i cant complain. amazon thanks"
4,Zune 30GB pros and cons,"I like the fact that the Zune has a 30GB capacity, large enough that I'm not going to max it out immediately, and the many things you can do with it--listen to music, radio, podcasts; watch podcasts, videos, photo displays. I'm not interested in the ""social"" functions. Generally, I give the Zune high marks and think the marketplace offerings are reasonably good for such a new product. The software is intuitive and easy to use. The main downside for me is that the unit is a bit bullky and doesn't fit as snuggly into a ""sleeve"" so it's in the way when I'm working out. Also, there can be a little bit of distortion when I'm moving around, probably because those pesky disk heads aren't quite as stable as they should be. Still, for the price, it's a very good deal."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought the Zune 5 months ago. It worked very nicely. It has not been dropped, yet the screen stopped working. Customer Support tells me it was from pressure applied to the screen and there is no warranty for the screen. They said it can happen without my being aware of it. This is a very fragile piece of equipment.Perhaps Microsoft will see fit to fix this problem in the future. I was told to keep checking the website. It is true that Micorsoft admitted there was a problem and extended the warranty on the XBox only when enough people began to return their dead XBoxes,My next large storage mp3 player will be an Ipod. I have had an Ipod Nano for over a year with no problems."
2,"Flawed product, worse support","Like other reviewers I wanted to like this product, but I just can't. After weeks of not being able to log in, it was recommended that I do a clean reinstallation of windows. That worked, but at what cost of time? Then I noticed that if the zune was plugged in while restarting, the computer would not restart. Supports response? ""Well, then don't plug it in while restarting,"" indifferent to the 6 hours of troubleshooting that had gotten me to that point. Anyway, except for the radio feature, there is nothing here to recommend this product over the iPod (don't be fooled by the communication feature - you'll never find anyone with whom to share). The iPod, albeit not perfect, is more stable, better tested, and offers more competant support."
2,Most disapointing devise purchased,"I wanted to get FM tuner, large screen for videos and MP3. The Zune appeared to be the best fit but as I tried to install the software on my Microsoft Media Center computer it would not run on either Media Center 2002 or 2004 but did run on the 5 year old Windows XP version, unfortunately all our media was on the new system. The kids received the iPod the same time I received the Zune, they were were up and in service within 1 hour the Zune took several days and one delay after another. Battery life is a significant weakness, a full charge will not run 1.5 hours over 3 days for use during my workouts. The web site is a challenge to navigate and manage the media. The picture was clear and controls reasonalble to navigate. TiVo to go software would not interface with the system so none of my recorded movie could be used. Overall I was disapointed enough to return the product within 30 days."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I was so sick of all the iPod followers, I figured this would be the perfect music player for me. Boy, was I wrong. Without getting too wordy, poor quality, poor design, poor implementation. Long story short, I ended up becoming an iPod believer myself. Go with the original, not a poor imitator."
1,Butt Ugly,"It really looks cheap. Made from what looks like plastic. Strange corners. A big boxy feel. Feels empty, not a solid, dense feel. It surely looks better in the pictures; but don't be fooled, in real life it is ugly.The screen is bigger but the resolution is just 320x240, like your iPod. So why all the advertisement about the bigger screen? Is it becuase they couldn't build something sleek and sexy?The click wheel isn't a wheel at all - it is four buttons: up, down, left, right. You want to scroll down? Push and hold the down butten. Looks like an iPod thumb twirler but actually just buttons.Parents. Don't surpise your kids with one of these, they will only be embarrassed.Disclaimer: I own a new iPod Shuffe 2G. I checked the Zune out is an electronics store; my 13 y.o. son laughed when he first realized the click wheel was four buttons."
5,****Here's a review from a REAL Zune buyer...not some iFanboy****,"I'm no tech-genious and I'm not a MS fanboy either, but the Zune has been a good buy so far for me. Sure it's a little bigger than a fraking ipod, but it's not that noticeable. Another good thing is the screen. It's bright and crisp(from what I've seen so far). The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup. I can't compare it with iTunes, because I've never really worked with it. Overall it's a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good player."
3,What do you know?,"Could you please only write a review if you have first hand experiance, you people gave it one star based on critiques from other firms, people check the amazon feedback to get reviews based on first hand account, they can look up cnn's review on their own. I know that you guys are probably self proclaimed consumer advocates, but come on."
1,Don't Buy...Don't Buy...,"(1) Poor picture quality. Horizontal lines on vids due to low quality resolution. Blown away by the amazing quality of iPod...but Zune is truely disappointing.(2) 50% thicker the comparable 30GB iPod. In fact, even the 60GB-80GB iPod is slimmer.(3) Wheel mouse is difficult to use and not cool.(4) Cheap design. Plastic snap-on to the surface looks like its going to break off.Zune is hand down NOT even nearly comparable to iPod's superior design, function and quality. Forget Zune for Christmas. Its absolutely horrible.By the way, the brown looks like the color of feces. Overall player just grosses me out."
4,pretty phat,"The round dial makes you think you are getting an IPOD. Its a clicky directional pad like the old nintendos had. Its ok. The screen and graphics move well, not quite in the same league as apple but the unit lets you subscribe to ZUNE. Its flat out cool and makes all other services obcelete. A device like this will wipe out all other services, this means you itunes. Havent we heard enough Icrap...?? I This.If you want the first subscription player that works, this is a good one for you. This is the first one, in three years this thing will be even better. My computer was stolen a few weeks ago and all my itunes with it, apple wont replace music I paid for, so they lost my business.. this new zune is pretty rad, you will like it."
1,DefectiveByDesign,"Zune is a case study in Groupthink. Share a song with someone IF they are within 30 feet (despite wifi can't share with friends across town our around the globe), for 3 days or three plays which ever comes first, after navigating though a time-consuming menu of permissions? Half the songs from the Marketplace are blocked for sharing. Zune's Wi-Fi is crippled so that it doesn't connect to your PC or to the Internet. Zune is bigger and heavier and more difficult to use. Why anyone would buy this is a mystery to me."
4,"Good player with software ""problem""","Hello, I have Zune 30GB over a month and so far I am very happy about it. Solid case, good sound....nevertheless I was very surprised when I started organized my music files - simply there is probably some bad routine in software, because it does not organize my files in the order I want. I spoke to my friends and they reported similar problem. If anybody knows how to fix it....."
4,"Bulky, but reliable and durable","This seems to be more heavy duty than the iPod. I've dropped it many times with no noticeable damage. The translucent cover that it comes with probably helps to protect it this way, but it makes the item a bit thick (two cm or so). You won't need to get a case for this. The Zune software for syncing media is a bit more circuitous and less intuitive than iTunes, but I prefer how it begins with nothing in sync."
1,"Okay box, execrable software","Someday, if I decide to mess around long enough with this, the clunky, counter-intuitive, user-hostile Zune software will transfer what I want into my Zune. Or someone will develop software that will.The software is inflexible to install, froze countless times during the installation, and runs at a snail's pace when it runs at all.The player itself is okay, and if I figure out how to put video into it (not one word on ""video"" in Zune's software ""help"" ...) it might even do something my old Creative Zen Xtra didn't do. Oh yeah ... it does have a radio tuner. Oh yeah ... avoiding radio was why I wanted an MP3 player.What a disappointing purchase."
2,Attractive Product that Back-Stabs the Consumer in 2 Ways,"Zune is clearly an attractive package in terms of interface and sound quality but Microsoft has, with this product, betrayed the consumer in two ways: First, Microsoft didn't fulfill its promise to allow customers to trade all their iPod songs, for free, for their Zune. Clearly, when the reality of this ""trade"" hit Microsoft, they back-tracked. Second, a percentage of all sales goes to Universal based on the presumption that Zune owners are going to steal music. This is a horrible precedent, to charge customers based on the theory that they use MP3 players to steal. Now will other companies have a hidden ""steal"" charge? Such a flagrant disrespect and betrayal of the customer should repel everyone from the Zune. If the Zune fails, the public wins."
4,AHH SOFTWARE KILLS!!,"I received the Zune 30 GB Digital Media player for christmas. I can honestly say, I was thrilled. The appearance of the Zune surpassed the iPod by far. I rushed to install the software in my computer and it was not compatable because we had an older version of the windows media center. After two days of trying to update our computer we finally gave in and used it on my dads. The software is a little buggy, and the syncronizing part of it is annoying but all in all Im happy with my gift."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"I am sorry to write this review, but I want to warn people for buying a Zune Player. First of all, as I am from the Netherlands and purchased this product in America, when I came home from holiday this zune player wasn't compitable with Microsoft Vista. So a new mp3 player isn't compitable with a new operating system. So for me as gadget-freak I felt dissappointed already from start. Fortunately it was compitable with my old XP computer.. Installing Zune software isn't too hard but Zune Marketplace can't compete with e.g. Itunes or Rhapsody. Also I find it strange that Rhapsody has far more tracks available than Zune MP.Now after four months my battery has failed. So my new mp3 player which cannot be installed on a dutch version of Vista is out of order.. I deeply deeply regret this product. I strongly recommend people to buy e.g. the new Ipod Itouch or Iriver... You will be much be happy with either of those.."
1,Terrible Product,"I tried this last night and it's horrible! The scroll wheel doesn't work as well as the iPod's. It's a cheap immitation. It's basically just 4-directional arrows underneath a wheel! The iPod blows this away. Also...the sharing feature is useless! Nobody else has one. Every time I turn it on there is nobody to share with. The social isn't so social afterall.Now the major gripe...This thing is ""chunky."" It's ginormous! The iPod is so much more elegant.In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod. I highly suggest if you are looking for an mp3 player that you sing another Zune and get the iPod as well. There just isn't a better player!"
2,Not a good buy,"The device itself works fine, and was happy with that. The Zune software, however, is not so good. It will go through and re-classify all your mp3 files without your permission. There is a way to disable this, however it forced me to upgrade my zune software, then went out and changed all my files again. I called Microsoft Zune support, and got routed to someone that barley spoke English, and dropped my call. Ended up returning the device, will look at getting an iPod. Is fine if you don't have many mp3's already, but if you do, be careful because will change how you have them saved on your PC."
3,microsoft zune is good,microsoft zune 30GB is good value for money. But for aesthetics Ipod takes lead. Wifi is waste in zune player.
4,Zune-Good,"The zune is a very good unit. I'll start with the pros:*The zune can hold much more than the Ipod*Has built in radio tuner*holds pictures*big screenand basically anything that's already on hereCONS:*The program is sort of mediocre*The accessories are costly (But note the fact that the Zune is barely 1 year old)*The wi-fi capability has that three song restraint*Could have better button design (i.e. scrolling)The battery life of the Zune could be better, but varies on the settings.Overall, off to a good start. For all the Ipod fans though:you have to remember, this is the FIRST GENERATION Zune. Until Microsoft gets more input from the public, it's not going to be perfect.But, I think they did a very good job for a first generation MP3 to be competing with the current Ipods.[...]"
4,Steal a Deal!!!,"Goodies: Awesome for the price , Shipping was quick, Easy to use, Big screen.Badies: Doesn't let you store regular files."
5,my zune,very nice mp3 player and videoplayer forZune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)new generations.
2,Player Good...Zune software BAD!,"I think my review will mirror most out there: from a hardware perspective the Zune is a great player...even better than the iPod in my opinion as it has a radio and better video.However, the applause ends there..the Zune software is horrible. It makes duplicate copies of songs on the player, sync's stuff you tell it not to, and adds incorrect album art, artist and album info to roughly 30% of the songs on player.The software alone is reason to look elsewhere.These are remedial issues that Microsoft should've fixed before bringing the product to market."
5,sorry pod people,I got the brown Zune right before Christmas as a gift to my self.. I must say its the best gift I have ever gotten. Set up was easy. I have had only one problem with downloading and that was easy enough to solve.. My Brother who is Mister IPOD MAC guy..took one look at my Zune and said.. well crap its better than my nano.. Oh yeah i got mine for 99 bucks on here .. I love it!!!! Oh yeah download stuff from Amazon because it works on both formats.!!
3,Great when it works,Item freezes up occasionally - have to bang it against a hard object to get it to work again. Doesn't find correct album art very often. Ugly color.
4,Good Product,"I wanted a replacement for the iPod 30gig which I had broken. This was the only logical choice seeing as Apple no longer makes the 30gig iPod. The Zen players I never really liked aesthetically. Great player, does everything you need from a HDD music player. Only thing different from the iPod is the poorly designed Zune software. The software makes editing ID3 tags a pain, but thankfully I still have Itunes for this reason. Only thing I could have asked for was a clock. No installation problems, as of now wireless syncing does not work, haven't found anyone with a Zune to share music with either. These fixes I assume will be fixed in later versions of the firmware updates, I am not worried, I am waiting for the possibilities of the wireless function to open up. Not an iPod killer, good alternative though, and holds up better to scratches and wear and tear."
2,Truly Terrible Software Design,"My expectations were fairly low, I just want an MP3 jukebox to use in my car and with my stereo receiver. So... the sofware crashed a few times on installation. It did sync my files, but many albums/folders won't play correctly, edit correctly, and it's not because of copyright protections. I suspect I have to re-organize and dummy things down for the Zune to get to play folders properly. Otherwise it's OK, but if you use a computer based mp3 player like WinAmp, working with Zune is like playing ping pong with the village idiot. The interface does not run smoothly on your desktop, it repeatedly hangs-ups and I'm talking about running it on XP, SR2. I have to say it's very disappointing to see a company like MSFT put out a product that seems 3-4 years behind the curve software-wise. Yikes!"
4,Zoone 30 GB Digital Media Player,Exceeded my expectiations. It is easy to operate. Recommend that others consider the Zune if they are looking for an excellent digital media player.
4,great purchase!,"Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)I received it as a Christmas gift and was very excited to get it. The software downloaded easily. When we first tried downloading music onto it, we had a little bit of trouble, but then it worked when we re-started our computer."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Zune 30 gb digital media player for my husband for Christmas as an upgrade from his iPod. Unfortunately, no where in the information did it say we would have to update our Windows Media (even though our computer is only 2 years old). This is going to cost us an additional $[...] on top of the price of the Zune. Needless to say, it's now mid January and we still haven't updated our Windows Media, so he still can't use the Zune. I wish Amazon had explained that before I purchased it or I would not have purchased it."
1,Buyer be ware!!!,"The Zune is a very nice unit. Only had it about a month but left it overnite to charge. By morning it developed an internal cracked screen. Apparently from a overheated internal battery. I found this out by checking forums on the net since I thought it could have been dropped. Zune support will not tell you it overheated, only that its not covered for repair. Microsoft/Zune will not replace or repair the unit. Next time you watch TV, try imaging watching it with cracks running thru it, its not pleasant.Carmen Baldwinsville"
5,Buying a new one!,"This is my favorite, although it is outdated. It has wonderful sound quality! I brought it back in 07 for 199. The price has yet to decrease so I am going to but a refurbished one"
3,turrn_n_burn509,it is a good item but i have found that on some of my music it has spaces or just wont play when it works on the pogram and on my mp3. i have taken and cleared my zune and tried reloading it but that does not seem to have worked out that well to fix the problem. but other then that it really is a good product. i think this just might be an opperator error.
3,LUV IT SO MUCH CANT HATE IT.........,Ok i fell in love with it when i got it i mean SOO MUCH better than ipod vid.. this is THE BEST Mp3 and trust me i did tonz of research only one problem...i got an Mp4 video(which shood wrk with it) and it wont wrk i got it frm limewire though so...i dunno all the vids dint wrk and the one thing the all have in common is that they all under properties say that they are unprotected.......WTH does that mean plz sum smrt dude help me out by posting a review here i will be cheking
3,Love the Zune but the software stinks....,"I bought the Zune for my husband. He has been asking for an MP3 player for years and I finally bought him a 30GB so it could all his music. He loves the screen, the color, the ease of use, but the software is not that great. When he first installed it the software was messing up and it looked like something was wrong with it, it wouldn't show up clearly and it was hard to use. He had to go on different websites and chat rooms to get help and he eventually had to reinstall it from the Zune website. Now, it works but it is not really user friendly-he liked itunes much more. If itunes were compatible with Zune, he would be using itunes instead. Overall he loves the Zune and I saved about $100 buying the Zune instead of the Ipod off amazon.com!"
3,Doesn't support east asian characters,"I got my Zune with the upgraded software today, the new Wi-Fi feature (Zune to pc) and enhanced interface were nice and all but just a reminder to some of the buyers: at the current stage zune firmware 2.2 does not support east asian characters and also there is no hacking software available to fix this glitch. so if you listen to a lot of songs with foreign language titles then you might wanna consider something else."
3,Great player...lack of support,"Let's face it, we live in an ipod world. Technically the Zune is superior to the 30GB ipod in every way. Unfortunatly the Zune software and marketplace leave alot to be desired. The firmware upgrades for the device are not comming fast enough. Good luck trying to find accessories readily available.I use my Zune every day and love it's performance, but come on Microsoft, unlock this beast's potential already.Until there is adaequate support, I would recommend to anyone looking for an MP3 player to buy a Zen."
4,Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player,Works great and I got it QUICK! 30 GB stores a lot of music. Video has to be .wmv to convert but the video is pretty good. Radio works but seems to be all presets.
2,Zune is a fair product,"The Zune is a fair music player, not the best and not the worst.If it wasn't for the fact that it is so locked down and Windows only it would be a great deal.You have to use the Zune software to sync with your computer for transferring music files.The software is an over glorified Windows Media Player, and makes importing your song library not the easiest thing to do. So unless you are doing a fresh copy from your CD to the Zune it will not be an easy task."
2,Zune - defective battery,"On another note, it seems that I got a defective Zune (why would this be the case since it's the first batch of devices?). Anyway, the battery status is very inconsistent and moving up and down. I only played the Zune for 15 minutes and the battery is now half and falling below that margin after a fully charged.Being very nice to the device, I also turn off the Wireless feature, just to conserve on battery (what a joke that was). And yes! It was fully charged before I started using it.Contacted Amazon for a refund on this thing."
1,Microsoft strikes again,"It took me 2 hours to get the Zune to sync with my computer, and an additional hour to load songs onto it. I'm still dumbfounded that someone who's been making software for so long could produce something this bad. After getting past software issues, the Zune player itself isn't all that great either. It's user interface: Junk. It's immitation click wheel (which is actually just a 4 way directional pad): Junk. It's design: to bulky, to heavy. It feels like I'm carrying a brick in my pocket.Overall: Microsofts first attempt at breaking into the MP3 player market and taking back some of the market share which is primary owned by Apple, is a complete failure. The only hint of innovation that the Zune shows, it's Wi-Fi connection to other Zune's, isn't enough to detire someone from buying the iPod instead. Save your money, save some agrivation, and buy the iPod, it's a far superior product."
4,Great MP3 Player for reasonable price,"Great product, software is easier than iTunes, Larger Fonts makes it easy to read, and its navigation is great too."
4,Love It !,"This is just outta this world..After you get to understand how to use this..You'll love it..It's just ashame you can't drag and drop everything you want to from your computer.. And you will be spending some more money to download some good stuff from an on-line web site..Amazon did have the best price, for sure."
2,too much of a hassle,"This player is a major pain in the neck. It is very hard to download songs, transfer songs that I already have (sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt)If I dont want to have all the songs on my hard drive...well there is just no way I could figure out without the stupid software deleting in my player also.The software stinks!"
4,Awesome,great except for click is pretty noisy and you cant share music longer but thats not the zune's fault its microsoft
4,Good for the money,"I love my zune. A little bulkier, but the interface is better than an Ipod. I have never really gotten used to the scroll wheel and the directional pad is great. Probably not an exercise device, but totally pocket-able.The screen is huge and bright and I have watched several movies on plane trips without any problems, and the battery life is probably good enough for two+ movies on a single charge.If you can find one of these for less than $100 I'd grab it. 30GB will be enough to store all of your music and the video playing is about as good as it gets for the price."
1,Screen cracked and not covered by warranty?,"Hi! I bought one last May, and it worked fine for the first 2 weeks. Then, it started freezing when playing songs, no reason at all, it just hanged.. So I tried different things, and seems to work for a while..But one day after I had used it, put it in my nightstand (not charging) , when I went to use it the screen was cracked. There was a crack in the middle of the screen, but the screen cover was intact. There was a blob of black right in the middle of the screen. Of course, I couldn't see anything. So I called Microsoft, and they say it's not covered by warranty.. I was astounded, it's not like I dropped it or anything, I am very meticulous. After going a round with the customer service rep, I did some research on the internet. Seems I was not the only one with the problem and it is apparently common...I guess Microsoft just sent me back to Apple, never had a problem with the ipods.."
1,Didn't work Zune,"This is the second Zune we bought. The first one had a cracked screen and the second one does not work. In fact, we are about to send it back and request a refund for the purchase."
2,"Looks great, feels great, didn't work!","Before you freak out over two stars, just know that I never actually got to use the Zune!Bought it new and followed directions for first start exactly. Let charge first but the device would not keep a charge! After a while it did get a full charge but the device shut off after 15 seconds and refused to turn back on. Customer support made me feel smart, but did not solve my issue whatsoever. If you get a Zune that works, awesome, but be wary. Manufacturer does not care if the new products they sell work or not."
4,Zune 30 Gb,I am happy with my decision to buy the Zune. The price was a bit high for an older piece of technology but I can't stand Ipods so...
5,Great product!!!!,"I LOVE, LOVE this zune. I have the option to customize the setting and I have so much space. Great prodcut and I would reccommend the zune to others."
4,"Zune is mostly good, still deficient","The Zune is a wonderful media player, and is very easy to manipulate. The design is dynamic in its simplicity and easy to navigate. If there is a downside, it is scarcely to be found in the player itself. The Zune software, sadly, is decidedly sub-par. While frequent updates have improved the user-friendliness over the past year, it is still cumbersome and awkward. I, like many, am forced to do any editing or grouping on an alternate program and then load it into Zune. As far as the device is concerned, my only complaint is that playlists cannot be created on the go, only at the computer. The 'currently playing' list is a poor option because it is far too easy to push one button incorrectly, say pressing 'play song' instead of 'add to now playing', and the list you just compiled for your car ride home is erased."
1,no returns,i purhased this zune and the on off button broke. they would not let me return it. i'm not buying from them again.
4,Zune better than Ipod,"I purchased the new 30mb Zune for my wife at christmas. I did a lot of research before buying and compared the Microsoft Zune, Creative Zen Video:M, and Ipod Video. In my opinion, both the Zen and Zune had much more to offer than the Ipod. The Zune has a brilliant screen and an scratch resistent finish. I didn't want to be forced to use Apple's music and video file types, which was the main reason for choosing the Zune. It accepts standard MP3 and AVI formats and uses Windows Media Player 11 to organize the files. It has limited wireless capability which is basically worthless unless you have someone else with a Zune to talk to. Micorsoft should have had the wifi communicate with wireless networks with an internet browser like the Sony PSP. It does have FM radio as well. I just wish it had an integral FM transmitter so you could play it through your car stereo without dropping another 80 bucks on a car kit."
1,Not good at all.. Do yourself a favor and buy something else,"Heavy, slow, Ugly with the worst music management software I have ever use. I returned it and bought an iPod.."
1,doesnt work and not user friendly,this product is user unfriendly as there is no detailed manual available with it. Also the product keeps turning off intermittently even when the battery is fully charged.
1,Very frustrating!,"I wanted to like the Zune. I spent several days trying to get this thing to work with my new Dell laptop, and I'm sorry to say after much frustration, I will be retuning my Zune. The final blow came when I discover that by installing the Zune software on my computer it caused me to loose my entire Napster music library. Before you ask, I'm not new to computers. In fact I'm a network administrator so I know a thing or two about computers.I bought the Zune because a good friend seemed so happy with is Zune. That has since changed; He bought the Zune because he liked the wifi feature. After several failed attempts to share a song he became frustrated with the Zune. The one successful attempt took forever and drained his fully charged battery. At least he didn't lose his music library. This product is not ready for prime time."
4,Hit and Miss(that's right),"Great product, I love the Zune...It's a great mp3 player, however i ordered early shipping which did not work out, in fact i took longer than 7 days to receive my zune which was supposed to be in 3-5 day delivery. Amazon did offer to repay for the shipping charges, but i was still disapointed.But if you're reading this review to decide if you want to buy the Zune...Go for it. I definately like it better than the IPOD and its compatible with much more file types(WMA MPEG AVI, ECT"
1,underwhelming,"profoundly average.i should have listened to my kids. another poorly conceived, indifferently executed product from the folks who brought us Vista. i've had it, it's my last Microsoft anything. nearly 20 years a loyal consumer, what a DUNCE. save your money, you know it, ..... get an iPod."
1,Zune vs. other mp3/ipods,"This is the worst possible music player I have ever used. I bought one for my niece for Christmas last year. It has been sent back to the company 5 times for repairs. It either locks up and will not shut down or you can't reformat it. If you are lucky enough to get it reformatted, after listening for about 30 minutes it does the same thing. This last time it quit working, it locked up; the screen went completely black and it would not work at all. I didn't even bother calling the company again. I will never buy one again."
1,disappointed,"I never received it. After charging my account and confirming a delivery date, 6 days later it was cancelled because they were out of stock. No acceptable accomidations were made. I then issued a complaint to Amazon and never received a response. I am very disappointed."
1,No tune with Zune,"I purchased a pink Zune for my daughter. She was very excited the day it arrived and immediately unpackaged it and started to install the software. Three days and two support calls later, the Zune software was loaded. I had to disconnect my computer from the internet to successfully load the software. The Zune 1.3 Firmware was never able to load. Very challenging. We eventually got the Zune working and loaded about 1300 tunes from her library. That was easy. The device worked for about a day after, when the display went black and would not restart. Another call to Zune support and after 15 minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong, I came to the conclusion that there were too many issues with the product and decide to return it for a refund. I would not recommend this product."
1,Think Again!,Mine is in the mail. It's going to be fixed again. Most of the reviews here are full of it! They all sound like commercials!If you really want to know what owning a zune is like before you buy it simply sort this list from worst to best by rating and read 10 or so of the more honest reviews.I'd be surprised if this device does not generate a lawsuit or two before it fades into obscurity.
1,Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (White),I was unable to load the software on my Window XP pro device. I spent an entire day with their tech suport people trying to resolve the issue and they were unable to get it to install. Save your self the frustration buy something else.
5,Love It!,"I was in the market for a media player with video and more and saw the Zune. It was such a deal ($99) that I could not resist. It is fantastic. I now have all my music, pictures, videos, TV from my Tivo, Podcasts, and videos from YouTube in one place. I bought the car adapter as well, so I can play my favorite tunes everywhere I drive. With TV shows from my Tivo, I can keep the kids entertained while traveling as well. The device interface is intuitive and quick to learn, and the software interface is very easy as well."
4,"Zune, good for the price","Great product for the price, $100, when compared to the other products on the maket of the same specifications. The software needs a ton of work however. I have tested other mp3 interfaces and this one is clunky to say the least. Video is great but the conversion is slow as heck (all night to add movies). If Microsoft dumbs the software down to a drag and drop level and removes all of the restrictive features so that you can use it to transport data, they will have a definite winner. The FM tuner is a great touch and the controls are very easy to use on the player. Good video quality and battery life is comparable to industry standard. This a great player for individuals who's music to video split is 80/20."
5,Zune Review,"I really like this product! This is the first MP3 player I've had and I'm 54 years old! The music is clear, I have 200 CD's loaded and it's not even half full. The screen is large and also very clear. I have been able to download pictures of my grandkids and have them with me all the time.This is a great product....I can't compare it as I'm not familiar with the others, but I have been so happy with my Zune that I bought one for my husband too and he really likes his."
4,Daughter very happy,"This was on a clearance on Amazon, got it for my daughter for Christmas and got a lot of bang for the buck. She is VERY happy with it, was more than she expected. The only downside is the color (yuck) and screen quality is good but not great. Very good sound quality, very very good ease of use. Great capacity if you're mainly a music (i.e. not a video maniac) person."
5,Microsoft Zune 30 GB,I was very pleased with the service we had and how quick the product was sent. I strongly recommend this product and the business that sold it. Thank you.
1,Display model misled consumers,"The display unit at Walmart misled consumers. It does not even look close to the actual product which is so much thicker than the actual product.Ligitation lawyers should make noteof this. It could be potentially a false advertising law suit.Why is Microsoft spending time and millions of dollar to produce Zune, a ME-TOO product which is generations behind other MP-3 products not to mention any names?"
1,wanted to like this but was disappointed,I received this zune the other day. I think it is the same with all zunes. Right out of the box i was disappointed. I hooked it up as instructed. I installed the software as instructed. When it came time to actually get the music from my pc to the zune it was very awkward. I tried the usual copy from pc to mp3 player as in the past. The zune would not allow me to copy music to it the windows explorer way. It made me copy through the zune interface way. I found it very awkward to copy from pc to zune. I have had much cheaper mp3 players that were more intuitive in copying music. I am also a geek. I know my computer stuff. I don't recommend that you purchase zune in any flavor or capicity.
1,TERRIBLE ITEM,"Please save your self a terrible and horrendous headache and if you are even interested in buying this item then DONT and buy an iPod instead. Microsoft has always been strict in their compatibility issues, but the system requirements for this thing are insane. Half of the time it wont even be detected by the computer and if it does work then a few seconds after being detected it crashes the computer."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"Well said by Tvshooter, ""I think Microsoft just wanted to get the Zune on the market before Christmas"". I have been in the software/hardware business for thirty years and this item has missed its mark! After playing with the zune.inf file and registering .dlls to get it to work, I finally called it quits and returned the product for an IPod! My gut instinct told me not to purchase a product that is version 1.0; however, since it was Microsoft - I thought - ummm - what the hell - let's give it a try! Well, dissapointing! I felt like I had returned to the dark ages when PCs first came on the scene. This was no way to spend a Christmas morning! I will wait for version 3.0."
1,Cheap and expensive,My recommendation is to wait for the next generation or even two for the Zune. I experienced the Zune and iPod for the first time during the last couple of weeks. The Zune felt cheap and clunky compared to the iPod. I thought the iPod had better screen resolution and seemed like better quality. The Zune is still working out bugs finally working with Vista but the wireless seems quarky. No one has the Zune yet so no one to share with. The FM doesn't seem to work very well on the Zune having a lot of static with the stations it connects with. It would seem Microsoft would put better quality FM with the Zune since it is one of the features iPod doesn't have.The iPod seemed better polished and the interfaces worked better. I would wait if I were you for a year or so before getting a Zune. Don't throw your money away at a first generation product that still has to many bugs to work out.
4,Zune family,"Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music, pictures and videos with me always. I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks. I have about 1900 songs,40 videos, and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go.Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband, son, and sister.We are now a 6 Zune family and growing. We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!,"I am a big fan of Microsoft and what it stands for but I dont know what were they thinking with this idea!!!!!!! I was gonna buy a MP3 player about six months ago but when I heard Microsoft is coming out with its own, I decided to wait..so yesterday I got this ""Zune"" and tried to put it in to my laptop..I have many friends who have ipods and i have closely seen and experimented on ipods of different generations at the stores myself...and also heard how easy is to use iTunes...so when I installed Zune Marketplace...I was surprised how complicated things were...you have to sign up for this...this...and that..I was so mad..I was like all I want is to pay 99cents and download a song!!!!! after 2 hrs of playing with it I've decided to return it and buy an Apple ipod...very disapointed in Microsoft..This product looks like it was hurried to put in to the market..to compete with an Apple..."
2,Buyers Beware!,"The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price. The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library. You can find the fix on the forum, but it is a lot of work to fix. Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening. There is no fix yet for this. There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one. I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD. If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD. Sorry Zune, I wanted to like you."
4,Can't beat it for the price.,"Pros:Huge, vivid screen.Truly excellent sound, even at low volumes.Robust design.Excellent updated software/firmware.Wireless connectivity.Best packaging ever.Cons:Huge, bulky chassis. (versus the competition)Backlighting can be uneven.Battery life not quite as advertised."
2,better than some - but not an ipod,"microsoft is trying, but they still have a long way to go. the zune is noticeably thicker than the ipod and the 4 way control pad is a real step backwards from the ipod's touch wheel. i like the bigger screen, but not enough to suffer through the pain of a 1.0 software release. no thank you.after criticizing apple for making a closed ecosystem, microsoft abandons it's own ""plays for sure"" partners and ditches the whole ""choice"" argument in hopes of making an end-to-end solution that doesn't suck.keep trying, guys. i'll check back at version 2.0"
1,won't play drm'd videos,"So, what this means is you can buy this microsoft product from amazon, yet the amazon unbox videos are protected with the microsoft drm scheme and the zune will not play drm protected content.makes no logical sense whatsoever.the 1 star is for microsoft and amazon. get it together guys."
3,User friendly but not as good as advertised,"it's introduced made in Japan, but finally i got it stil found 'made in china'. the presention a bit cheap. not as good as my expectation.the software so many bugs, it drags my system memory a lot, while i am using it i have to close my all other applications....but it's a love gift for me. i still love it. :)"
2,Very Disappointed,"Got this as a Christmas gift. Wasted 6 hours trying to install software on my PC, finally got it to sort of work after reading several MS online articles, then had mp3s freeze during playback on the Zune. Other problems included errors syncing, softwware not recognizing Zune, playing audio or video was slow or unresponsive. Returning it ASAP. Looking into the Zen Vision W instead."
2,"Decent Player, Horrid Store","The player is nice, if a little large. The store is terrible. You have to buy a package of points. If you don't spend all your points Microsoft still gets the money and keeps it until you do. Say you want two songs. You have to buy $5 worth of points from Microsoft. Each song costs $0.99, so Microsoft keeps your $3.02 in it's back account until you spend it. Now say you buy 5 songs at once. At .99 a song that comes to $4.95. Microsoft keeps your nickel.So in reality the price of the songs are more than iTunes, but they don't tell you that. If you buy just one song, it's $5. If you buy 2, it's $2.50 a song. If you buy 5, it's a dollar each. Microsoft does not tell you about the hidden pricing. It's this kind of if not downright deceptive then misleading practice that makes me shy away from the player."
1,Not good,"Not a good device to invest money. Like Windows this product hangs in between and when you put more songs into it, it happens more."
3,Mixed reviews,"I just bought my 30 Gb Zune this week. It's an elegant little device...attractive, easy to use, fantastic graphics and a great radio tuner (my favorite local station displays the artist and song titles). Plus, it has let me rip a few protected discs that have been invisible to iTunes. However, the software itself is ridiculously buggy...it crashed the system (an HP Pavilion), disabled Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and Windows, and rendered my USB drives inoperable. I had to uninstall and reinstall XP and Internet Explorer. Plus, I had to download Windows Installation Cleanup Utility to nuke it out of the system because it refused to uninstall. Silly me, I then loaded it on the Dell laptop. So far I've only had one Blue Screen of Death and it has ""experienced an error"" and shut down several times, but otherwise hasn't affected the system. I still think it was worth the $129 (Office Depot), but I wouldn't buy it at full price. Definitely keep up with the patches and updates!"
4,Nice Media Player for the Money,"Just received my brown Zune 30 two days ago. Installed the software and connected the Zune to my PC. It upgraded to a new firmware and then loaded all my music from my itune to the Zune library and then sync to my Zune player. It took about 6 hours to sync all 2.5k of songs, 4k of photos into it. It is good to do it before you go to bed and then it will be done the next morning.I like the player. From the package design to the finish of the player, you can tell MS has put quite some effort into it. I think for $89 that I bought last month from amazon.com was a steal! It sounded wonderful and the large LCD screen is really eye catching.The only things I don't like is it. Even though the player is made in China, it doesn't support Chinese characters or maybe some other foreign languages. Even my $25 Sandisk MP3 player can display my Chinese songs without a problem. That's why I gave it a 4 stars."
2,it'd probably be great if i could get it started,"I was looking for an mp3 video player with around 30 GB , good resolution. Something that would hold up if i dropped it and stuff. I read all of the Zune reviews about how people had trouble getting the software loaded, and didnt think anything of it. i have the windows media program that is listed on the website as something that the zune would work with.well it doesnt. if i want my zune to work id either have to get a whole new computer or completely whipe my hard drive and start over. i dont have the time or the patience.BUT. i do like how it's organized. it charged fairly wuickly and as far as i can tell from the pre loaded stuff it'd be a pretty dcent thing if i could put my own music and videos on there.all in all, im sending my brand new zune back and getting something else---and praying that it will be more compatible with my computer."
1,Why bother?,"What's the big deal? I looked at it in the store, took it for a test drive. No big deal.So you can wifi a song to a friend. Big deal, whoopee. They can only listen to the darn song 3 lousy times for 3 days. Gee, don't let me get too excited.The 1-star is for the 3"" display screen, which is nice. And the 30GB is OK.But we don't get anything new here and are still tied down in many ways to music subscriptions. It's baloney. AND the price is no deal.Do yourself a favor and buy the Creative Zen Vision:W or Creative Zen Vision:M. I've used both, and an iPod. Creative Zen or iRiver offer the most flexibility and the most features without strapping into a million rules.What all these MP3 & photo players could use is better calendaring, more like Palm calendaring AND wifi for anything."
1,I hope it gets better!!!,"I think Microsoft just wanted to get the Zune on the market before Christmas. The main reason I bought the Zune was for the video capabilities, the larger screen and I already own the Orignal IPOD. You cannot sync up your Windows Media Center recordings to your Zune at this time. Why do I need a Zune then? Really dispointing!!! There are no podcasts or videos on the Zune marketplace. I am going to be patient and see if Microsoft releases some kind of firmware improvement in the next three months. If I see no improvments Apple IPOD here I come."
1,Buyer Beware,"After the reading the reviews, both positive and negative, I went ahead and purchased the Zune 30. Big mistake! My initial load of music and pics went smoothly but it all went downhill from there. The device kept freezing or timing out each time I tried to add new music or pictures. I re-installed software, did both hard and soft resets and neither worked. After repeated attempts I am now only able to use 5Gb of the 30 Gb I paid for. I am unable to add anything. Support has been totally useless. They keep repeating the same instructions never mind the fact that you have repeatedly tried these same suggestions. Before purchasing, I suggest you check out the forums out there to get a feel of other owners' experiences. Believe me, there is a reason that, for all its great features and good pricing, Microsoft has not been able to gain a larger share of the market. This device was a big disappointment!!"
1,Zune,"In regards to this review I have one word, ""Don't buy it!!!"" Ok, maybe a few added but it's a strong sentiment that I have regarding the Zune vs. iPod dilemma. I had to be different and now paying the consequence. The Zune Marketplace is sub-par. There are no full length films to purchase. Several positives include being able to listen to radio, a larger screen, and songs are cheaper to download. Still not worth it in the long run."
1,Problem with Zune,"I have purchased Zune last year and now its dead, can not be charged. I tried everything but nothing is working. I have wasted $230.00 for peice of junk."
5,See Ya Ipod!!!,"I have owned two iPods before, but after using my new Zune for a few days I'm liking it so much, is it perfect? no, were my iPods perfect? no.Plus I really like the interface, much nicer than the iPod's white screen.Also the spanish music selection is way larger than the iTunes has and I have acces to all of them with my subscription."
2,Zune 30 GB took me a week to install software,"The software for this Zune took me literally a week to install, after several calls to both the Dune technical support and Dell technical support. On the positive side, the Dune technical support was helpful and I wasn't placed on hold for 20 minutes. I still have to figure how to put videos on it.S.S."
1,CP435,"The product itself is excellent. However, the software used to transfer music is miserable. It took me an hour to install and update the zune. The device has good potential but, not really worth the money now"
3,"Nice, but clunky","Bought this product as a replacement for my Creative Zen Vision:M and I was a bit disappointed. Obviously any of these devices can play mp3's just fine, but the MS Zune is unable to play just about any video. There is one video file type that it will natively play and anything else will require you to go through a cryptic conversion process. The size of this old version is a large pill to swallow as well. The size of the screen is awesome, no doubt about it. Unfortunately its inability to play most videos forced me to revert to my Zen Vision:M. I'm giving it 3 stars because the very few videos that i did get to work looked great, but it took so much work to get them recognized that i was literally angry when I watched them."
3,Zune,I purcahsed 2 of the Brown 30gb. One worked fine the other one did not. I sent it back in one of Microsoft supplied boxes. They lost it and told me it was never received yet I had a signed copy of the person who signed for it. I finally got one back. Not the one I sent in to have fixed. Not real happy with Micosoft and their support or lack therre of. No problems with Amazon they have been great.
1,I wonder how far I can throw this...,"I'm having a difficult time finding words for my disappointment. Let me start off by saying that the hardware is more than decent. The Zune sounds great and feels solid, with that said; the software is worse than I ever could have imagined. If you buy this, make sure your music is tagged to perfection and even then, the Zune's software misinterprets tags and randomly fills in blanks with information it pulls seemingly out of nowhere. I truly cannot believe that the people behind the software interface still have jobs."
3,Zune is ok,"Microsoft puts out its fighter again the popular Apple iPod. No contest. Unfortunally for Zune, the iPod wins. The only real thing the Zune has to keep it alive is a bigger screen, song sharing, and different colors besides black and white. None of these are really going to make a difference. And I agree when people say Microsoft made things irritating by using the points system to buy songs instead of 99 or 79 cent songs. Zune is nice if you are a hardcore fan of Microsoft and hate Apple. I bought a Zune because I wanted to be different than the whole iPod crowd but now I see why there is an iPod crowd. It is better. Sorry Microsoft, its a no go for this one."
4,The best MP3 player,"Without a doubt this is the best MP3 + Video + Picture + FM player available in the market. The software is easy to use, it will download album art so it looks great while you are listening to music. Support MP3 and WMA. Videos must be converted to WMV, but you can load any video format into the Microsoft Windows Movie Maker (comes with XP and Vista) and convert it to wmv.The only weakness and that is the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the battery. Three hours to fully charge it and lasts 3 to 4 hours listening to music. Tests says that can last to 14 hours, but that it is not true If you move forward, or backwards in your playlist and select things, and watch a video etc, the battery will run down very quickly. I hope Microsoft place a new battery with better performance for future versions.Anyway is a great product, but get a travel charger so you can have the battery charge in condition."
5,zune is the best,I love the Zune !!! although i did have problems installing the cd to my computer and had to try many times. Other than that the screen is nice and big for display and movies. also u can change the background to make it more personal. the sound is great and the program updates and puts music you just added to your library without you having to do it. very simple to use there is also a radio . the downsides no clock or games.
3,Its nice but it has software issues,"im not talking about the software being glitchy it just isnt very good, my software does not recognize the fact that i do want that music on my zune just not on my computer, because of this it is incredibly frustrating because it deletes the music off of your zune, so you have to go dig through your cd's to find the cd and rip it again just so you can put it on your zune, it has good music and video quality, and other than the pain it can be to get the software updated, it works well and i like it"
3,"Great player, terrible battery","I haven't explored all the functions yet, but so far the Zune has worked out nicely as an alternative to the iPod. The one downfall that I have definitely noticed is the lack of battery life. I don't use it all day, but it seems as though the battery doesn't last that long.Overall, it's a nice player. Still need to check out all the other cool features. (video player, wireless connection, Zune-to-Zune sharing, etc.)"
