4,Targus Presenter is great once you get it to work!,"I bought this style of presenter because it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles and was affordable. Unfortunately, it was not easy to install/ connect to my system. Fortunately, Targus' technical support was very helpful and between them and our IT administrator, I was able to install the presenter. Now, I think it's a great product, but it gave me fits to install."
5,great product,"Some people have said the laser pointer isn't very good... but as long as you remember to turn it off when you're not using it, the laser works really well... this is a very good inexpensive tool that really enhances any presentation."
4,Good pointer and works right out of the box,This pointer presenter works great the only drawback is that the laser pointer does not show up well on LCD monitors. (I'm not sure any will) easy enough for my wife to use with her laptop and small enough ot carry in the laptop bag.
1,Did not work,Did not work right out of the box. Followed the directions to reset and it still did not work. Button on side is too small. I returned it to Amazon.
5,Everything I expected,"OK - haven't had a chance to use it during an actual presentation... but everything I've done with it so far lives up to my exact expectations. The buttons do exactly what they're supposed to. It's super-intuitive, easy to click buttons and runs like a charm. Highly recommend it."
4,Targus remote,"love the size and being able to store the USB transmitter in the the remote. I travel and do presentations, so this works great, does not take up too much room and it works great. I also like that it has an off button to save the battery when traveling"
2,Range is horrible!,I used this for a presentation at a church. The range on this was horrible. I had to stand halfway up the pews just to get it to respond to the click to advance a slide. Don't waste your money. Luckily it was cheap. Definitely gonna buy a much better one in the future.
5,Presenter,This product is a high quality remote control for a laptop projector that works as advertised. It has a great range for the presenter and controls the slideshow as expected.
1,Question,"Does this presenter have silent buttons?? I am videotaping presentations, and the video picks up the clicking sound of the buttons on the presenter I have. Anyone know if this - or another - presenter has silent buttons??"
1,Targus wireless presenter,"This is a piece of junk. I gave it one star because there was no choice of no stars. It is not like its description or the picture in the ad. The USB receiver is about the size of your thumb nail and if you drop it in a poorly lit room, forget it, you'll never find it. The plastic backing (which has to be opened every time you use the receiver) is difficult to move and I guess it would be broken within a week of use. The devise itself is very small and therefore it may be difficult to find the correct button without looking down at it. I showed it to several of my colleagues (college professors who use wireless presenter) and they thought it was a toy! I returned it and bought a better one which cost a bit more but I love it (Logitec). Trust me...DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.College Professor"
2,Fragile,"This pointer does work, as long as it is intact. It has a small on/off switch on the left side, storage for the USB receiver inside, and is a nice small fit for the hand. The buttons are nice and ""crunchy"". However, it cannot take even one impact with the typical classroom tile floor. It flies apart, and the toggle for the switch has to be refitted just right into the top and bottom of the case, or it will not click back into place so that it is functional. This happened with the first one I purchased, and I exchanged it for another. The same thing happened to the second one. In both cases, I had dropped the thing only one time. I would not buy it again."
2,on off switch broke,I only had the opportunity to use my remote for about 30 classes. The on/off switch started sticking and finally broke off. Now it is stuck off with no switch. I might try sodering it on.
2,Broke after 6 months,"This is a prime example of you get what you pay for. I had this for about a year and used it maybe a dozen times. Plugged it into the laptop one day and put a fresh battery in the handheld and nothing, changed batteries, still nothing. The unit it totally dead. If you don't mind throwing away $30 every few months then go for it."
1,It works but you can't see it!,"It is great to have only ONE thing to hold while doing a presentation. It is really responsive as a remote (to change your slides). Somehow it even works when you are standing in front of the USB or it is behind you. Miraculous. HOWEVER it only gets 1 star since it might as well not have a laser pointer. The red dot is SO SMALL you can barely see it and it is really weak that it only appears on really dark backgrounds under low lighting conditions. TOO BAD! Even though it is cheap and works, I have to buy a new one it is so bad. Save yourself the $<30 and get a nicer one. Targus customer service can be hard to deal with as well."
5,Powerpoint Slide Helper,This device I use often. I can stand away from a computer while teaching a class that I have projected onto a wall and still be able to move up or down a PowerPoint presentation. A Battery seems to last a long time in this device too.
4,Targus Presenter,"The Targus presenter is a very valuable and extemely efficent tool. As a teacher, the presenter lends itself to multiple uses and the ease at which to use it makes it even more helpful. The tool was a great price since I had been looking at various stores in the area.I highly recommend this product and ordering from Amazon was quick,easy and very cost effective."
4,Good for the price!,"For the price, it's a very good presenter. It does the basic things you expect from a wireless presenter: laser pointer (not so great but works!), and powerpoint presenting. I didn't try it on long range, but it certainly works no matter where you're pointing the device. I read in other reviews that it uses a lot of batteries, so I'm following their advice and turning it off ( a small switch on the side) when I'm done, and I always keep a spare battery in the case it comes with. Overall experience is very good, and great for the price than other fancier presnters that range from 50-100$."
5,A complete support for today's teachers,"This item satisfies basic necessities of expositors: A laser pointer, commands to change between slides, other to change windows and a site to hold the USB connector when is not used (since this little receptor is usually lost). And is affordable!!"
2,The laser beam is too weak,"As a remote controller, it worked well and reach was not an issue for me. However, I found the laser beam to be extremely weak (hard to see and hard to find from a distance) and regretted not buying a different, higher end, product."
5,Does just what it says it will do,I'm a Community College instructor and have found this to be an invaluable tool. The newer projection system we use doesn't allow remote advancement of slides. This inexpensive tool does just what it says and works perectly and without fail. It was as easy to install as a flash drive. I'm now able to interact with my classes instead of being held hostage behind the lecturn in order to advance slides. I also really like the darken feature and use it anytime I think a class is copying power points instead of interacting with each other on the subject. Rate 5 stars because I can't give it 6.
2,If only it would always turn on,"Once I got this device to turn on, it worked really well. Range was great, the laser is bright enough. It's easy to get to the batteries. The control buttons are intuitive enough that I never have to look at the presenter to know what I'm doing. Although if you try to do two things at once with your presentation hand, you can easily hit a wrong button.The main problem is getting the device to turn on. I struggled twice for over 10 minutes not knowing if it would ever activate. When it did activate, I couldn't determine what got it to work all of a sudden."
3,Never lose the USB receiver!,The wireless presenter worked just fine for me. I have two and I use them for powerpoint presentations all the time. I recently lost the USB receiver and contacted Targus to ask if a replacement was available. If you lose the tiny USB receiver somehow you are out of luck. Throw the presenter away and purchase a new one because there is no replacing it. I wouldn't buy this again.
3,a little cheap,The battery cover broke the first time I used it! It does the job otherwise and was worth the price!
5,"Easy to use, does what it's supposed to.",I like how you can store the USB plugin next to the battery. I like how small the device is. It works like a charm with both Prezi and PowerPoint. It sets up in seconds. I highly recommend it.
1,broken so soon! bad services from the seller,"I am very disappointed at the product and service from Adorama customer service. Firstly, the seller sent me the presenter different from the type i ordered at Amazon. Since i am urgently use the presenter so i didn't return it. Then the presenter's ON/OFF switch fell off after just a couple of weeks, without any misuse.Adorama rejected to replace new one for me and the only reason is that the order has been past 14 days. The seller simply asked me to directly contact targus for the quality issue.At the end, Amazon received my claim and gave me full refund. I really appreciate Amazon's services while I will never buy products from Adorama.The presenter is easy to use but i am not sure if i am the only unlucky person to get a bad product."
2,Buy a better one,"The slide advancement features worked fine, but the laser was weak (to say the least). I had to use a laser pen in addition because the laser couldn't be seen even at close range.Save up a few more dollars and get a better one with a green laser, unless all you need to do is advance the slides.Mine has been replaced."
2,Targus PowerPoint Remote,"Item was not how it appeared in the photo on amazon. The small chip that you insert into the USB to power the remote is difficult to remove, and it's easy to lose. This model is extremely cumbersome and I am disappointed that it's not the model that appeared on the Amazon image. If I had known what it looked like and was aware of its features and buttons, I would never have purchased this model. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase."
1,Not built to last!!!,"I have purchased two Laser Presentation Remotes from Targus and they have both stopped working after a time and without warning. The product is great as long as it works. When you are doing presentations, you need dependability and this is not it."
4,Great basic presenter,"I've used this presenter for two years now (same one), and have found it an invaluable aid to giving PowerPoint slides in lectures. I don't find it burns through batteries.I have 2 gripes, however; the on/off switch is darn hard to use, and there's no convenient way to determine if it's on--or off--except by using it. My other issue is that I find the laser pointer pretty weak, so that it's barely useful.When it first came out, I (and my colleagues) were enchanted. Now I'm in the market for one with a brighter laser pointer.I do recommend it for an inexpensive work-horse; you won't know how you lived without it. But--you may find that you'll want to step up to a one with a more powerful pointer eventually, like I am..."
1,Would be great if it worked...,This product has failed us on two presentations. Performance is intermittent. The buttons have a cheap feel and the plastic flimsy. Would definitely return if I could find the packaging.
1,Targus wireless presenter,"The old cliché you get what you pay for is true in this case. I ordered one, didn't work (laser pointer), returned to Amazon, got another one and it wouldn't work either (advance nor backup) the slides. Returned it and ordered the Logitech presenter."
2,Unit kept switching to blank screen by itself with Vista System,"Very frustrating. I don't know if it was due to my Vista operating system or????Kept switching to a blank screen by itself, even when I put it down! I did not have this problem with other remote wireless presenters; very distracting and irritating!"
5,Great for the Novice,"I've been using this device now off & on 6 months and I couldn't be happier with anything simpler. For PowerPoint presentations this was the first and easiest device for me to use in a large room.I'm still a little shaky with the Laser Pointer but I've found that I don't use it that often anyway.Since I don't use it everyday (and I remember to turn the device off)the batteries are still the original. I love the little carrying bag included with it! If not for that, I'd loose track of the USB connector."
4,the Bride wanted it,"When I get a chance to use it, I may give higher marks. It is what she wanted and a happy bride means a happy home."
4,Good Pointer & Remote,It's an excellent functioning remote and pointer. The distance at which it works is remarkable. My only complaint is that it is a bit on the pricey side.
4,"Works well in Macs, if only on PowerPoint","Pros: It is inexpensive, works on my Powerbook 12"".Cons: It works almost only in PowerPoint, laser beam is weak."
2,"Good literature review, very dated absorption technology","The review of the Clean Air Act is well done. Absorption tower examples are very dated - saddles are stated to be the preferred tower packing, so the tower designed is grossly oversized with enormous pressure drop compared to what is possible with a modern packing. If you need a reference work with practical examples to pollution control towers keep looking."
2,Air Pollution Control Technology Handbook,"If you need a reference work that summarizes the Clean Air Act then this is a good source. It is also has technically sound theoretical explanations of air pollution control. However it is a poor source if you seek suggestions for any type of current air pollution control project. The examples in the text are extremely dated and hence grossly oversized. The authors recommend that saddles be used to pack towers and then design the tower to have over 40 ft of packing. As a result their towers are much to big, much too tall and have enormously high pressure drop. Unfortunately the authors ignore (or are simply unaware of) several generations of mass transfer packing development that allow for much more practical and far less costly designs than per their examples."
5,very nice product,"I wasn't sure about buying this because a lot of people seemed to have problems with it, but decided to take the chance anyway, and i am so glad. it works as a regular phone, you can take both your landline and internet calls with it. instalation is as simple as it can be. to use with skype, i saved all the numbers i regularly call (not that many) and then i just push the skype button on the phone and can see who's online, then all my saved constacts. makes it easy. otherwise push and hold 0 for the + then add area code and phone number, or 011 country code area code and phone number, then push the skype button. i also got skype in which allows people from my home country to make a local call from their phone and reach me. worth looking into if you have friends and relatives in other states or overseas.UPDATE/2009 - Philips stopped offering software updates for this product to keep up with skype's updates. The product still works fine but I am disappointed with that."
2,phone not registered with base and it's not compatible with vista only xp,OK I BOUGHT THE PHONE FOR A REASON TO USE IT AS A HOUSE PHONE WITH SKYPE I HAVE AND XP AND A VISTA FIRST I CONNECT IT WITH VISTA AND IT DID NOT WORK FOR SHRIMP NOT EVEN AFTER I DOWNLOADED THE LATEST DRIVER FOR VISTA OK SO THEN I WENT WITH MY XP AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY WITH NO PROBLEMS UNTIL 2 AND HALF WEEKS LATER THE PHONE STARTED SAYING PHONE NOT REGISTERED SO I TRY TO CONNECT IT AND IT SAYS SEARCHING FOR BASE FAIL AND IM STILL WITH NO PHONESO I RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE AND IF YOU BUY ONE THEN GOOD LUCK WITH IT. BUT FOR ME I'M DONE PHILLIPS NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED...:(HOPE THIS HELPS
5,I HAVE A QUESTION?,"I do not have a land line. I am looking to hook up to skype and I am interested in this phone. In the description it says it you connect it to your pc, land line and wall plug. Can I just plug it into my computer ans I am good to go, or do I have to have a land line to pluge it into as well? any insight would be appriciated.Thanks!"
1,Do NOT buy this phone.,"Until they have fixed the ""unable to dial SkypeOut numbers from the handset"" problem, and resolved the ""disables my laptop speakers unless I uninstall the phone"" problem.Like another reviewer said -- the phone is very elegant, feels great, and is of superior quality in many respects. However, it is not possible to dial a number directly on the handset. You have to dial a number from the PC, then save that number in your Skype contacts, and only THEN are you able to dial through SkypeOut. It is a real pain in the neck."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!,"All I want to do is a simple SkypeOut call by dialing the number myself - i.e. WITHOUT going through my Skype contacts. I've spent HOURS trying to get it to do this. The review above says you need to prefix the number with the + sign by holding down 0. I've tried this several times - e.g. +1 222 333 4444 - but it still inists on trying to dial a call via landline.Also, I'm getting intermittent problems with my broadband connection since installing the driver for the phone. It just cuts out without warning and the only way to get it back online is to disable and then re-enable the connection in the Network Connections window. I NEVER used to get this problem before installing the driver for this phone.I'm on the way back to the store to ask for my money back."
1,not possible to dial through skype a number directly on the handset!,"As said before, this has little value if you can NOT dial a number via skype not in your skype contacts. You have to dial a number from the PC, then save that number in your Skype contacts, and only THEN are you able to dial through SkypeOut. It is more than a real pain in the neck, it makes this product unusable."
3,Has potential,"This is a nice looking phone with some great features. One thing that I love is the dual line. If I were to have a landline, this would make a big difference on local calls with the benefit of switching to Skype for inexpensive long distance. Another cool feature is the kid mode, where (when set) any key will forward to a number of my choosing, which is useful if, say, the kids are with a babysitter & need to reach us.The phone does have some spotty reception at times, and battery life is definitely unclear. I charged it for 2 days straight (24 hours was recommended), but it still registered one bar on the meter. Just today, my wife reported a strange staticky sound and then the phone shut off, and this was after a full night of charging.This phone has a lot of potential, but the jury's still out on if it's a definite solution for my Skype needs."
2,Returned Because it is NOT a Stand-Alone Skype Phone.,"I returned this phone without even opening the box because it was not the stand alone Skype phone it appeared to be from the product description.I later suggested to amazon.com that they improve the product description, not sure if they did but I admire them for giving customers the chance to bring something to their attention like that!"
1,Can't get this to work with Vista,"This product is supposed to be Vista compatible, but I could not get it to work, and couldn't find a solution with Philips or Microsoft. This seems to be a commonly reported problem. So I don't recommend this for Vista users."
2,Good Product but ....,"The phone works well but it has its limitations and there is missing data in the advertise information. For example it says you longer dont need a computer, but to make it work it have to be conected to the USB port and skype running in the computer, so it's not independent from the computer at all. At the same time it is not compatible with MAC OS, and it does say it.If you want to have your computer on and work with windows its a good phone for the price. Ist simple, no luxury at all but can talk nice."
2,Ugh...no Macs and Network connect,"Okay, I really wanted to like this product, but it showed up and only had a USB connection (no ethernet). That's okay if you constantly have your computer running and never have crashes, but if you do like to turn your computer off or have an unstable operating system (this thing only runs on Windows after all; no Macs and no Linux) then you run the risk of losing calls. Other than that the phone looks great and has very simple features. Probably why it's cheaper than all the others. Also, it has no ethernet connection. If it at least had that, you could run it straight to a router and forget about the computer. Probably something to think about before you buy this!"
1,from good to bad,At first this product worked well. Purchased one for my father too. Then my handset would no longer connect (after about 6 months). I tried a hard reset and everything the manual said. So I quit using this and just went back to the old headset and computer. My father's unit did the same thing after about a year or so. Coincidence?
2,"Poor service, too much disturbance","I did not get the product for a long time and when called no one to answer the phone.I was able to use it may be a few time online, too much disturbance if you use it for lan line use.Now the skype software doesnt work either, it doesnt detect it and i tried reloading the software but it doesnt workSo not worth the price"
2,This phone drives me crazy!,"I've had this phone for over a year now and am ready to throw it out the window! It goes through spells where it will work fine, other times it will drop calls or not pull up my contact list. Sometimes the problem will be fixed if I restart the computer, other times nothing will work but just giving it time. Also, my additional handset has stopped working completely and says that it's always searching for the base. Save yourself some money, time and frustation and don't buy this product!"
3,SOLID AND ELEGANT PHONE WITH SOME FUNCTIONS TO BE IMPROVED,In our firm we use quite extensively the skype phones for international calls.We have tried the netgear wi-fi phones but we have had some troubles with installation on the network.Then we moved to these philips voip 321.Unortunately we confirm that we cannot dial a skype number if it is not already on the contacts ( possibly unless you do some complicated procedures ). Moreover the phone is quite pricey.However since the construction and the sound are of good quality and we had no troubles during the installation we decided to use these phones.Our opinion is tha the hardware is very good but the software should be improved.
2,Not For Advanced Workouts,I didn't like this video very much because I found the moves were done too quickly to give good results. It was also very difficult if you didn't have a chair of the perfect height around. On the bright side the instructors were cheerfull and positive.
4,If U Don't Know...U Don't Know!,I consider myself pretty knowledgable when it comes to soul & R&B music/artists but i had never heard of Ruby Andrews. And that is ashame. Had A friend send me a Youtube link and the search was on. I hit Amazon.com first and found this album. Another gem! A Great introdution to a great artist!
5,Comprehensive,I would recommend this to anyone who wants to better themselves in the region of art history knowledge and the ability to evaluate art's content as well. It was well worth buying and compliments any classes orientated towards the subject...maybe would even overshadow the required text.
5,Gardner's College Text,"Great price on this book, it was in really good shape and I was really impressed with how fast I received the book. I will now buy all availble textbooks from Amazon because of my great experience!"
3,Not the One I Ordered,"Book is good; however, the seller claimed it was never used, but the one I received has some cover bents."
1,Horrible,I am extremely disappointed in amazon and this book. You guys delivered it over a month late.I'm not paying for amazon prime so I can receive much needed books over a month late. I had to go to my College bookstore and pay $120. You wanna know the worst part? They don't accept devolutions. So I'm extremely disappointed.
4,good transaction,"Smooth transaction, book in great condition,very pleased and would do business with again."
2,BEWARE,The GLX_CELL_15_W_SALT TURBO is warranted for only 1 year. Mine lasted only 18 months and has to be replaced. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Spend the extra $100 and get the one with a three year warranty.
1,Echo the beware!,"This is not a funny fraud. The web site absolutely said it had a three year warranty and when the box arrived it had a big ""One Year Warranty"" sticker on the side. For $150 more you can buy the three year warranty version from your local pool store. Don't fall for this Amazon error."
2,Mediocrity,"In short a decent biographical sketch of Bower's development and leadership experiences, however the whole point of the book has been underminde by ""The Firm's"" recent involvement in various scandals. It focuses too heavily on 'integrity', which can no longer be harped on in the same sentence with McKinsey due to SwissAir, Enron, etc.All in all, a heavily biased book that provides minimal objective value add. There are MUCH better leadership books out there...Good to Great, etc."
3,Great Individual - mediocre book,"This book tells the story - atleast it tries to - of one of the most influential persons in business management, and hence its something worth reading. But on the otherhand, its not a great book from the style of writing - it doesn't really tell a good story and the over-riding focus on integrity - given the more than few recent episodes - I am tempted to say, its not a very balanced piece of work.But I certainly recommend this book - despite giving it just 3 stars - gives us an insight into this influential person and his life. It provides some great ideas - valid even today on developing and living a concept - in this case - Management Consulting. And well, also shows the importance of being at the right place at the right time and having the presence of mind to realise the same!!I will still wait for a better written book on the life of Marvin and McKinsey sometime in the future!"
4,A really fun game that occasionally has one major flaw...,"As a fan of old school NES games like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy, I jumped at the chance to play a game that sounded similar. The game play is quite similar to Final Fantasy in that you wander from town to town, find items, fight battles with a team of five men, and dungeon crawl. I made it about two thirds of the way through the game and absolutely adored it before I discovered its fatal flaw - occasionally, it is impossible to beat the game. There is an item that your party needs called ""Dead Wood"" that, due to a glitch, occasionally does not appear, thus making it imposible to get to the next area. After looking up some information online and finding out that this is only an occasional glitch, I decided to play it through again and had no troubles.All in all, I loved it, and I would highly recommend it! (Just be aware of the possibility of the glitch!)"
3,"Looks good, but get a better one in the store.","My wife & I love baking, so we thought this product looked great online. When we got, I was shocked to see that it was so small. It looks like it was taken out of a child's baking set. The only nice thing about it is that I can use it in our relatively small toaster oven & I am going to throw it out since we are moving & not feel guilty about it! You can get a better one in most stores such as Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, or higher-end stores such as Williams Sonoma."
4,Drunken rapping Iowans with access to kind bud,"It's about time somebody blew a big hit of smoke up the...stale world of hip hop. I think a lot of ""legit"" MCs should sit down with this album and take some notes. It's not that these guys are great rappers, although at points their flow is amazing, but their lyrics and beats are far more inventive than anything I've heard come out of the rap industry in almost a decade. Hip hop has turned into hair metal in almost every aspect. It's primarily male dominated, it's usually violent, and most...but not all... of the musicians making it are really stupid. The SUCKA MCs however are actually clever and witty.If you're like me and love hip hop, but can't stand what it's become you HAVE to hear this album. You wont be let down."
3,Potential in question?,"""What happened to Afu/Tires flattened at the drive-thru/On lunch/Hit the sophmore slump/""Thud""/Life Force Radio's a ""dud""/A letdown/Like a ""Browns"" fan/Mustangs and wedding rings/Like ""Grant Hill"" being injured again/It could have been beautiful/Has potential/But he fell through like mergers/Not enough evidence to convict him of murder/So It's borderline"" - Dimpals a.k.a ""Johnny Dangerously"""
4,Life Force Radio,"When I first heard his first cd i was amazed. His second is just as good. Underground Hip-Hop at its best. He dosent even need to curss that much because he has such mike skills. Almost all tracks produced by premier and guest appearences by RZA, guru og gangstarr, MOP and more. Amust have hip hop instant classic."
3,Hmm not bad but could be better,"His first album is much better in mine opinion.i think his new album dosnt have much creative like the last onethe beats aint so dope like the first album, of course AFU-RA is still a hot mc!nice tracks in mine opinion on his newest album are2. Scat Man5. Crossfire6. Open7. Lyrical Monster12. 1, 2, 313. Think Before You...17. Blvd."
4,Nowhere near Body of the Life Force...but keeps underground,"This album lacks the creativity, and the beats that made Body of the Life Force so good. One thing this album does continue with is Afu-Ra's skills on the mic, and his lyrics. That's why this album gets 4 stars. This ain't no commercial crap relying on pop beats to make people like it. The beats arent as good here, but the lyrics u could listen to for days and never get sick of the album. This is not anywhere near as good as Body Of The Life Force, but it's still a solid album. The best song here has got to be Perverted Monks. Afu-Ra rips it up on that track, and it probably has the best beat on the album. The other best tracks are Hip-Hop, Scat Man, Lyrical Monster, and Crossfire. If you copped Body Of The Life Force, don't expect another underground classic like that. This ain't a bad album at all, in fact it's a solid album, just the bar was set extremely high after his debut, and this did not reach it."
4,DASHEIKS 2 CENTS: Why does this dude sound like Rebel I.N.S?,"Yo, GhostFace. Remember when you said you'd approach a n***a for soundin' like you or anyone from your clan? Well this dude Afu-Ra needs some approachin'. I was lookin' for Inspector Deck on the guest star credits when i heard this dude spittin'. I can't believe this guy actually went through with the flow that he so obviously swiped from my man Rollie Fingers.All in all, I gave this album 4 stars because it actually sounds better than Deck's new album. It's sad but true.Please people, let's stop bitin' in Hip Hop. I mean, thats sacred rule no.1. Do not bite because it's impolite.Peace On Earth."
2,Afura loses his focus.,"This album is a flop. His last Album ""Body of the Life Force"" is a straight up classic joint. This album feels like it was put together a little to quickly... the songs dont have solid concepts, and the ryhmes arent as well thought out. I should have figured that this album wouldnt have the same deep, meaningful, head bopping music as his last album, just from the name, Life Froce RADIO... It only has a couple good joints, but none of them come close to the genius of his last album."
3,Not great,"You do get what you pay for. The shipping was fast and seller terrific, but it doesn't really do much with my central vac. Only good for my hard wood floors, but not for carpet."
3,Do not be fooled by the picture... the pets shown will NOT fit.,"This is a TINY carrier. My cat is too cramped to turn around, and my 10 lb Shih-tzu does not fit in it either. My neighbor's Dachshund is too long. I think a Pomeranian or a Chihuahua might fit into this carrier. To put my cat or 10 lb dog in it seems like cruel and unusual punishment. It's a nice enough carrier, but you had better have a teensy dog."
1,Junk,Was so happy at first I got 2 more for a total of three. After about 3 months 2 of them quit working and nothing I tried would fix it. Gilmore should be ashamed. The older model is more reliable and cheaper.
2,Unhappy with warblig voices,"I was unfamiliar with this type of southern interpretation of hymns, and wanted to sample it. I learned that such singers cannot stay with a simple tune, but must wring the notes out in nasal tone shifts which disguise the tunesmith's intentions. A Northern Baptist would be chased out of church for this distortion of a plain old 'Hymn Sing.' Please, this kind of farce is suited to hill billy lyrics like, ""Mah mutha in lawr don' luv me no morrr,"" or some other nonsense, but not for church music."
1,studio ghibli works by carl orrje,"This cd is all instrumental. I personally, prefer to have words with my music, japanese or whatever. So if you like intstrumental music...this cd is for you. I honestly didn't think it was worth the price. If you are a studio ghibli (hayao miyazaki) fan, you should buy ""studio ghibli songs plus""; it is with words and straight from the movies."
4,Easily identify constellations during different seasons.,"Although this book is clearly meant for children 8 and older, my four-year-old has been studying it for a full year. It's glow-in-the-dark constellations captivate her, and finding the constellations in the night sky re-inforces what she has learned. It's layout is simple for us to follow along with her, and it has sparked what could be a life-long interest for her."
4,"Great book for amateurs, terrific for a camping trip!","We've used this book when away from city lights. It's pitched for kids and adults, and is very easy to use (with instructions with each illustration to orient you by month and time). Great illustrations, but very little text. But you can't read in the dark anyway, and you'll be too busy learning the constellations!"
5,Rio Grande From the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico,"The Rio Grande River (Great River) is the third longest river in the United States that divides Mexico and the US. Peter Lourie travels the entire river from it's headwaters in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico. This is a wonderful account of his travels on this grand river. The history, rich land and people of the Rio Grande are captured in the detailed and colorful photographs. Each region that the Rio Grande travels through is unique and beautiful. I admire Peter Lourie because he is very respectful of the people and the delicate land of the Rio Grande. He did a wonderful job in illustrating the beauty and importance of this remarkable river. I absolutely enjoyed this book because the Rio Grande is very close to home!"
4,Best source on the baronetage,"This quasi-titled order of non-peers was instituted in 1611 purely for monetary gain, to persuade English social climbers with money to aid in the Protestant colonization of Ireland, and later of Nova Scotia. Since it is more broadly based in society than the peerage, the baronetage is of interest in its own right, but numerous baronets later were advanced in rank or married up the ladder. Each original volume was chronological by date of creation, and each had its own index, and so they appear in the reprint volume. The six volumes in the original edition were reprinted in 1983 at a page-size reduction of 80%, to produce a single oversized but manageable volume."
5,Roomates are better than ever,The roomates sound great on this new cd......tracks like Joanne(A Trade Martin orginal) and Anna My Love are as good as anything Dion/Belmonts ever did......Buy this cd immediatly
5,I REMEMBER CATHY JEAN & THE ROOMATES!,"I remember Cathy Jean & The Roomates and what a lovely song that they had ......""Please Love meForever"". I especially like the Roomates version of There's a Moon Out Tonite and Oh! Rosemarie.I think they are to be greatly admired for being together so many years. Surely, they must be nice guys.irene brodskyauthor of Poetry Unplugged[...]."
5,A one-of-a-kind literary tour-de-force.,"My all time favorite writer is William Faulkner. Very simply he had a way with words. Currently, only William Styron comes close. Sophie's Choice embeds itself on your psyche the same way The Sound and the Fury throws your emotions spinning down a steep hill. William Styron tells us that Edward Bunker, an ex-con, is the only one who can really make us understand what an ex-con experiences. Bunker does more than that. His ""way with words"" is remarkable. In five or ten years grad students will be attempting to explain the subtleties of Dog Eat Dog. For now, its a great read and a great story. Like any great fiction, be ready for the roller coaster ride"
4,"Harrowing, top flight novel stay with you...","This book was so gripping, I read it (blush) in a single sitting at a bookstore. Never bought it. The ending could have been a bit more plausible, but I woke up the next two mornings having dreamt about it. Whew!"
1,How bad could a reading of Metamorphoses be?,"I've read two translations of Ovid's Metamorphoses and enjoyed them so much I wanted to hear them read out loud. The first shock was just how abridged this reading was, it fits on only one cassette. But the second shock is how beyond painful it was to listen to the narration which was less about Ovid's (or Boer's) words, and more about the overacting of the reader. It's the worst thing I've ever listened to, and if this stops even one person from buying the tape, I'll rest easier. Waste of money. Waste of beautiful poetry."
4,Good buy for the money,"I've been using my Belkin unit for about a year now, and the Bulldog software that comes with it is the best I've found for any UPS system. I went and purchased plastic electric socket caps to use on those sockets that I am not using in order to keep dirt, dust, hair (we have dogs), etc., from floating into an unused socket and causing a problem, especially since this unit's sockets face upward. I strongly suggest that others cap any unused sockets so that you don't get dust shorting out the unit.After about a year, the unit needed to be replaced. I shipped it back to Belkin and haven't gotten it back yet. The problem with Belkin in this situation is that there is absolutely no way to check the status of your RMA online. You can only get an RMA online but you can not check the status of your RMA online! They've had the unit for about 3 weeks now, and I have no idea if and when a return unit will arrive here."
1,Zero Stars if it were possible!,"When I pluged this unit into the wall it started crackling and poping inside. About 3 seconds later smoke started pouring out from within. I unpluged it, took it outside and watched it smoke for another 5 minutes or so. Thank god I didn't have anything pluged into it."
2,A very confusing book! One of the series worst!,"This two parter book was too confusing and too long! Next time tell one story and make a cliffhanger! also do only doctor , not more than one! Explain more about the new companion Compassion! This book was one the worst books I've read in the series in a long time!"
2,Yet another self-indulgent New Adventure,"This, along with the first book, just ended up being another hodgepodge of New Age writing, as I've come to expect in the New Adventures: incoherent, self-indulgent, not amounting to much. There's no question that it's written with great confidence and that I read through numerous of the bits with interest, but at the end I don't seem to see what the point of it all was. Maybe it's just me, but this wasn't my cup of tea, and confirms my skepticism of the whole line of books."
2,muddy and confusing,"well maybe not confusing. but it was certainly too long, and you just kinda waited and waited to get to the good parts. but hey, this guy is more of an arc-itect than a writer."
3,Where's the Doctor?,"I haven't read too many Eighth Doctor books, and I'm wondering -- most of them seem to have marginalized the character of the Doctor. In this one, the emphasis is on the characters Sam and Sarah Jane. The Doctor is imprisoned -- it's never made clear where -- and his fate is left dangling in the second volume, which I'm loath to pick up. He simply sits in prison with his cell mate, nodding like Solomon and chastising himself. I would like to learn more about the character of the Doctor -- please start including him in his own books!"
1,One-sided cold war book from a Right-Wing author.,"A clear example of how NOT to write history! A clear example alsoof how to do politics in the old-fashioned cold war manner. Mentioning casual cruelties and warlike incidents by the side of greek communists and not touching the essence of the Civil War period in Greece, certainly does not bring any new light! On the other hand, the book is totally outdated, as in the last decade many archival sources about that period opened to research and numerous high-level studies for the period 1944-1949 have been published. I really wonder why amazon.com deals with books like that and ignores the most recent, well researched and balanced."
5,help for the computer shy - windows 7,"A Help for the Computer Shy instructional program in a bright blue box!This computer help DVD (which can be watched on a stand alone DVD player) has been designed for absolute computer beginners and does not waste the viewers time with things they don't need to know.HD screen recordings, colorful graphics and some live video are used to describe and demonstrate the *basics* of using a Windows 7 computer.The step-by-step instructions are in plain english with no technical jargon."
3,Common Culture,Book delivered quickly and in time for school. Not 5 stars because I was not aware they were sending the instructors version of the book.
5,William White escapes from Harrington Institution,"William White,Elizabeth's Ex-boyfriend,a whacko who's obsessed with her escapes from Harrington Institution[a mental Hospital] He gets revenge against Elizabeth's friends Winston becomes Boppo,A clown cheerleader+ Mascot who comes out of a Sedan,a 4 door sedan singing Make Them Laugh. Denise Is With him. Make Them Laugh is from one of my favorite musicals,Singing In The Rain. He locks Jessica up in Marsden Garage,but someone gets her out. Todd saves everybody from William White. William White Dies,or so they think."
4,Good stuff!,"I'm not a huge Avengers fan but I love Bendis so I gave this a go. It was really good. Plenty of action! David Finch's artwork is excellent. The sequence with She-Hulk ""hulking out"" was fantastic! it's as if he just kept getting better with each panel.Bendis' story was great. Not as good as he can get (see Powers -- he's so on his game in that series that it's sick!) but it was a great story all around. Tight superhero team and the end of an era.As I said, I'm not a big Avengers fan but I felt for these people. Their lives have been utterly ripped apart.Enter the New Avengers..."
1,pretty poor...,"i read the house of m and thought it was pretty bad, so while bored i decided to try avengers disassembled. unfortunately it was not very good either. i just didn't like anything about this book at all."
1,"yet another ""re-imagining""!","the avengers are just another in a series of victims of so called""genius"" writer/creators. if marvel serves up any more of this drivel it won't have any of its fan base left. its simple:heroes= goodguys, they win and live. villains= bad guys, they lose and die. got it marvel?! avoid this crap!"
4,A good solid read,"This was my first look at high-profile writer Bendis. He's the genuine article. Respect for the characters, for the continuity and for long-time/first-time readers is readily apparent. The story begins with a shock, then builds gracefully to an emotionally charged ending. The art is also superior, though I concentrate on the writing because that is usually the weaker component in comics stories. Not this time."
3,Pretty decent,"i'll have to agree with some of the earlier reviews. the story is a bizarre mix of idiocy and random deaths. the ""She Hulk segment"" is the core of the book. the pain the avengers feel is pretty strong throughout the book and the artwork is powerful.the first 15 pages are strong, but the rest of the book is a chore to read and the ending...ugh. buy it if only for the art and beginning fight sequence."
2,At least it's better than Austen's run,"I agree with other reviewers who say that this story is poorly done. There are a lot of continuity errors and unnecessary deaths. However, after having read the two stories written by Chuck Austen which immediately preceeded this one, this book looks like a masterpiece by comparison."
4,Why Hawkeye,I liked this comic a lot besides the fact that the killed Hawkeye and others. The story was well written and drawn but the fact that they did so much damage just to launch some new comics disappoints me
4,"Unique, Well-Animated Christmas Carol","The 3D rendering and animation in this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" are excellent. The snow seems so real you can almost feel it! The characters and objects in the scenes are obviously computer-generated ""3D"" graphics, but they look so good and move so well that no undue attention is drawn to them.The characters are animated animals, and the script has been redone uniquely, but the names and the general story line are followed closely enough to make it seem as if this were a retelling of the classic story, yet a new movie which could stand on its own merits.Here are a few examples of animals substituted for the classic characters: Scrooge and his nephew are skunks; Cratchit and family are rabbits; Jacob Marley is a grasshopper, and The Ghost of Christmas Past is a stork, I think.The jewel case cover is a snowglobe, too!"
5,Great movie,"I think this version looks great, since I got the jungle book: rikki tikki, alice in wonderland, prince and the pauper, and the three musketeers, and robin hood. So this is the last one to collect."
1,Cuts well but engine doesn't last,"I bought the Poulan Pro 2 Summer's ago, and it ran for most of the season then it started surging and burning oil. I brought it to the local lawnmower repair shop, and he repaired the carburetor, replaced the spark plug and filter. It ran well for the second season. Now it's starting to surge and sputter after one month into the third season. I always run the engine until the fuel runs out before I store it at the end of the season. Would recommend you avoid this model."
5,Works great!,"This product was a gift for my son who lives in another state. It arrived in perfect condition but he had to put it together. My son is not mechanically inclined at all!! I thought this may be a challenge for him. No! He said it was easy to put together and runs great! He said he no longer has to rake, he just cuts the lawn and the leaves go into the bag with the mulching. He loves it! Selected this particular lawn mower because of the reviews I read prior to purchasing. I recommend this product!"
1,Grass EVERYWHERE,"Gap at the top of the rear door blows grass directly onto the mower deck, stopping up the air filter very quickly. Buy a honda!"
5,DELIVERED TO THE DOOR AND CUTTING GRASS IN 20 MINUTES!!,"Delivered to the door, out of the box and cutting grass in twenty minutes - works for me! Starts everytime on the first pull and no stalling on the heavy turf on a .66 acre spread. Being that this model is not self propelled, gives this old gal's arms and shoulders a great and badly needed workout. Grass catcher is a tad small, but works great in the mulch mode. Strong, solid and sturdy at a great price."
4,Oops..not self propelled,"So yeah... I accidently overlooked the fact that this lawn mower is no self propelled. I sat that handle and assumed that it was self propeled.. oops..I was also so overwhelmed that Amazon would overnight this for $3.99 that I rushed it...But I did fire it up today.. .just add oil and gas... workes good.. lawn is looking better already. Pushing it wasn't so bad.. it rolls nice in my lumpy yard, etc.. so it's not a complete loss w/o the self propelling feature.It fired up on 2nd pull...got more mosquito bites pouring gas/oil than I did mowing..lol"
3,good but not great for the value,It is a fairly good lawnmower. It stalled a couple of times with wet grass. Starting it requires a very hard pull. The cut is nice and even. Pushing it uphill is a good workout.
4,Good CD,I really enjoy this CD. Disc one is all music from Rita Hayworth's films. They also give credit to the women who were used to dub over Rita's real voice. Disc two is all music by other stars who sang in movies and is fun to listen to.
3,EXPENSIVE!!!!,I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend so I never actually listened to it. I will however say it was EXPENSIVE as heck...my friend enjoyed it however I will never spend this much on a cd again....I don't care how hard it is to find.
5,Beatiful!,"I have the version with the French titles, but the images are the same as in this edition. As one reviewer noted, the art is reminiscent of the visually stunning Soprafino decks, but the 1JJ seems to have a certain warmth and friendliness that makes it a joy to use. This is probably my all time favorite deck, and I have been using Tarot cards since 1969. Don't be put off by the non-scenic pip cards. There are several easy systems for interpreting them. (For example, the Tarot Authentique web site offers some good suggestions.) Eventually you may want to devise your own system."
4,IJJ Tarot pack,"After a considerable amount of academic research into the history of the pack I've come - much to my own surprise - to the conclusion that the minor arcana of the IJJ (at least) is a most faithful reproduction of the very earliest traditions in the west, truer even than the Visconti-Sforza's minor arcana. The IJJ Major Arcana may have been equally authentic, but the nineteenth-century card-makers who modernised it let their heads go and there isn't enough left of the original form to be quite sure. (Luckily they didn't spend so much effort on the minor arcana)."
3,Pretty good but not great,"Charlotte and Nell are sister that now separated from each other. But not even the Atlantic Ocean can keep these sisters from keeping up each other. The emails are going between the sisters. Charlotte in London dealing with her three kids and a house that is falling down around her. Nell is in Canada,waitng to have another baby and dealing with the perfect neighbor, who is just like one of the Stepford wives.""And God Created the Au Pair"" by sisters Benedicte Newland and Pascale Smets was not what I really expected. I was really expected it to by the Au Pair point of view but this book is really just email between the sisters and there daily lives. While it was pretty good it was not a laugh out loud book"
2,Book's title is misleading.,"The title of this book is seriously misleading. I thought it was all about employing an au pair or an au pair's discussion of life and work in another persons home.It is written in the form of a series of e-mails between two married sisters who live a continent apart. It is filled with daily domestic details, mostly complaints, about their kids, husbands, neighbors, doctors appointments, fertility problems, haircuts, etc.If you are leading this life, and have time to read, you would surely prefer some escapist literature. If you envy this life, well, okay, read it."
1,Not funny at all,I watched the three stooges as a child and they were absolutely hilarious then. This movie totally missed the mark. Thought it would have been funny being the stooges but not sure what they were thinking. Had to turn it off about 30 minutes into the movie. Total waste of money but still happy I didn't actually go to the movies to watch it.
2,"MaybeI should watch this again, but","I don't get all the positive reviews. I understand they did a nice effort at trying to be faithful to the original shorts and movies...that said....I watched this movie and realized how much I liked the real Stooges MUCH MORE.The orphanage scene was Fun...it was Hard to accept all of them except Moe. The original Larry and Curly are Far Superior. I LOVED the original Three Stooges. Their movie shorts were Fun and you never really took them Seriously.I tried not to take this movie seriously, or expect too much. I just couldn't get into it. I think the Stooges are Best Left to the orignal movies.You are better off watching them then this movie which tries hard, but isn't good."
4,"Excellent job, very funny","It would be impossible to recreate the Stooges, they were just too good and too unique. Yet this was pretty close, and fairly good slapstick. It wasn't perfect, but very enjoyable and worth seeing. The ""her face rings a bell"" bit was the best in the movie."
1,a total waste of time,They tried way too hard to make the movie funny and it just didn't work for me. I think I laughed a few times. It was also too dark and not appropriate for children. Should have been rated pg-13.
1,movie sucked,"hted this movie , should have been on a different film stock too . Looked like a home video ."
3,It was ok!,It was ok. I really think the original was much better. I will buy the original if in a boxed set.
3,"OK, if you like the Stooges","The actors did a good job of imitating the original Stooges. My husband and 11-year-old thought the movie was very funny; I thought it was OK, but nothing spectacular."
2,silly,"Improbable, some funny lines. A lot of physical humor like the original; interesting remake of the classic 3 stooges movies."
3,Campy,"Their attempt to remake the original tv show was marginal, at best full of boring cliches and unfunny pranks. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Spot on. Surprisingly well done!,"I must say that as a fan of the original three stooges I was very skeptical when I heard that a movie was being made. Well, this was spot on. The cast was perfect, and most importantly it was funny! If you enjoy the three stooges at all, you should love this. I think the original stooges would be pleased."
4,Funny,"Very funny. If you like the stooges, you will like this movie. Very funny film. Four stars.Watch it and laugh."
5,Ture to the Spirit of the Original,"If you loved the original Three Stooges features, you should love this as well. The plot is updated to include current celebrities, but the gags are still the same classic slapstick. We liked to see the characters from ""the Jersey Shore"" get hammered by Moe."
3,Nothing like the originals,It was ok. I wished it were the originals. But a last they are no more. Good acting though. I wonder if any of their children or grand children thought of portraying them.
2,Terrible movie,"I was tempted to shut this off. My sons and I watched this movie, hoping it would be like the show a little bit. It wasn't.. there were a few laughs.. but overall -- don't waste your time."
2,Politically Correct Stooges???,"While the film has some good bits and was well cast the story was flawed when the stooges best known as shysters, vagrants are now pure of heart and it ruined it for me. I like many had high expectations and this left me thinking the Mel Gibson Stooges film wasn't so bad after all. And toilet humor, the stooges never needed to resort to that."
2,It is not as funny as it was when I was a kid,The movie did a very good job recreating the antics of the stooges. The problem is that at my current age it is not as funny as when I was 10 years old.
3,ehh,"I love slapstick comedy, but this was a tad ridiculous. The creators tried too hard to reproduce the original. It became unbearable to sit through the whole movie.... tip? A little bit at a time"
2,boring,Not funny or original. This was nothing compared to the old three stooges. The sound effects were fake too. I wouldn't recomend watching this only if your a die hard fan.
2,Don't Mess With an Original,"The Farrelly Brothers' affectionate tribute to Howard, Fine and Howard features inspired casting but few laughs. As the nyuks unreel, ""The Three Stooges"" (2012) becomes a rather pointless exercise - an unnecessary imitation of the inimitable slapstick trio. Judging by the movie's box-office thud, viewers needn't hold their breath for a Farrelly comedy titled ""The Marx Brothers."""
2,NOT TOO FUNNY- casting crew needs to catch the blame.,2 stars because it was not that good- can't believe thiis comment has to be so many words----dang it man
4,love the stooges,For anyone who remembers the stooges. They kept the theme througout and did not change the characters. This was our New Year's eve movie. Don't mind watching it over abd over.
5,About Time the Classics Return,My 11 year old grandson was staying the night and wanted to watch this movie- he thought it was great and my husband and I were delighted to watch as well. Great family entertainment!!
5,Why I oughta!,"Love this movie, and I've been a huge fan of The Three Stooges for over 50 years now, and this movie comes up to scratch by doing justice to the original Three Stooges who have made me laugh with joy and sing praise to, for so long a time. Congratulations to the production crew and all of the actors associated with this movie. A job well done! A must movie for any stooge fan to own."
5,great movie,great movie fast shipping i will be buying a hole more movies good price on there movies they have a lot to pick from
5,A very nice tribute the stooges!,"I am a die hard fan of the stooges. I heard that this was a good movie from another fan. He was right, I loved it! They did it up well. Not over the top. A very nice and loving tribute to the orginals.. a high five to all involved in the making of this film. The only thing I did not like were the cast of the Jersey shore. I can not stand those guys.Enough of them already!! But they did have a small part. And I would like to poke them in the eyes too, like Moe did. So I got a laugh at it when he did. The move was very good. A feel good movie."
1,only 1 curly,"The actors who portrayed Moe and Larry were good, but Curly can't be imitated, even by Will Sasso. If the movie wasn't bad enough, they had Moe working on Jersey Shore and had all the cast in the movie. Now that's seriously dumbing down."
1,I Can't Rate This,"No stars one through five are valid for me. I can't rate a movie I haven't seen. The movie never worked on my computer. When I went to the movie it said ""Resume."" I'd never started it and it would not ""Resume"" so I never saw the movie."
5,"Great movie, up there with the Stooge classic shorts","I've seen this movie the day of its theatrical release and I wasn't really expecting much and to my surprise I was laughing at every scene of the movie and thought the 3 guys portraying the Stooges did a great job with their roles, I could have sworn these three guys were really Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard cause of how great the new guys did with their roles, the supporting cast also did a great job with their roles and seemed to be having a great time in their roles, I think this movie should be up there with the classic Stooge shorts featuring Curly and Shemp."
1,Waste of 4.99,This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I did not find it funny. I always give a movie a chance I wanted to turn it off but I left it on for background noise while I read my book.
1,Very weak,Did not enjoy this movie felt it did not do justice to the original three stooges very disappointed glad I only spent 1.22 at red box by the way how did it do at the box office the other big flop was sandlers last flick whose name was changed from I hate you dad to some silly name I think it was a huge flop it was filmed on cape cod and got us all worked up but a huge flop
2,You can't go back again,"It's a pretty fair remake of the classic comedy team, brought (somewhat) up to date. The slapstick humor hasn't changed a bit, and the modern actors channel the originals with decent fidelity. It's almost as if the stooges were frozen in time, while the world moved on around them.The childhood years I watched the stooges were lots closer to the stooges' early movies (ca 1930) than to the present day. So, two things have aged in the handful of decades since: my own view of the stooges, and the stooge humor itself. Their inane slapstick no longer has the fascination for me it had when I was eight, and eighty years of movie-making largely left them behind. Although this homage appears to serve the purpose it meant to, bringing the three back to life, I'm not sure that most people (me included) really needed that.-- wiredweird"
2,Teach your kids to poke and gouge people's eyes out,"This is a good movie for those that want to teach their children to be violent and poke and gouge eyeballs and knock other kids on the head. What kind of parent would do that to their children? This almost teaches child abuse. I did love the part where they sang ""Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine!""I personally know of several kids who went on a Stooges inspired eye gouging, face slapping rampage after being exposed to the Three Stooges. If you take a poll in any prison, almost 100% of the violent offenders will admit to having watched the Stooges as a kid. Many of them would say their favorite Stooge was Mo. So mothers, protect your precious young impressionable babies!!!!Anybody who thinks this movie would be good for children is bogus, man, for I am sly as a fox, for real. See ya later alligator......"
4,"Bwoob, bwoob, bwoob!","Much better than I expected. Casting was right on the money.Laugh out loud funny, but you must like the Stooges to begin with to enjoy this movie."
3,Not the same,"I was hoping it would be just as good or better than the original Three Stooges but it fell short,just ok."
3,Fun and loyal to the originals,"I enjoyed this more than I expected. It was very well done. It was not a parody, or campy, but enjoyable because it was so much like the original Three."
3,The Three Stooges in retrospect.,"I found it nice that modern film makers would make a tribute to the zany, slapstick comedy of the Three Stooges. The film is well done, and very well performed by the actors. Some of the visual anecdotes are predictable, but who cares, really?I reckon that this movie is mostly recommended to Three Stooges fans, but whoever is interested in film history should have a look at it, without prejudice for the displayed violence."
3,"Expected more but OK, C grade instead of B grade","Expected more but OK, C grade instead of B grade. Larry character not very good. Moe good, Curly better than larry but still not nearly as good as Curly Howard."
4,not quite the stooges,"similar in many ways to Moe, Larry and Curly, these guys just need more practice. it was true stooge humor but lacked the vaudville touch the real stooges were able to hammer out short after short!!!!!"
3,My son loves it,My 8 year old son loves this movie. I found it to be rather corny. its just ok in my opinion
4,Fun movie,"If you liked the original Three Stooges, you'd like this movie. The same basic stunts. The same basic plot line. Nothing very original here. Something like ""The Three Stooges goes to Mars"" would be interesting, but would never happen."
3,No where like the orignal,"I found the movie to be funny at times, but, no where like the old stooges. Its not a must see but for free it was pretty good."
3,Better than expected,"Well, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be an awful remake of guys going to try too hard to be the originals. It really wasn't like that. Will Sasso does it to an extent with his Curly, but with the others, it doesn't feel like you are watching guys try to make money off of somebody else's work. It is actually worth a watch and has some new clever bits. Definitely worth renting."
5,hugh stooges fan,This film was really fun to watch...my husband is a Hugh stooges fan. We watch all the time in reruns. We both LOAO at this movie. So glad I bought it.
2,Slow and Boring,"Movie was slow and boring. There were a few funny parts with Larry David, but other than that not worth the time to watch it."
3,Cute Family Film,The movie was very funny in some parts and it is something that the whole family can enjoy. I do not remember any foul language or overly sexual situations.
4,I liked it!,"I enjoyed this movie. I've always like the Stooges and have watched them since I was a kid. Larry David is hilarious in this movie. I hope they make another movie with a less violent underlying theme such as the Stooges at college, etc."
3,Good if you liked the Stooges,"What can I say about a Three Stooges movie? My wife and I watched it together and it pretty much followed the same type of madcap escapades that the original shows on TV did. If you like slapstick and if you liked the three stooges on TV, you'll like this. I liked it. My wife hated it! I thought the cast was really good. These three guys acted and sounded just like the Three Stooges. If you're looking for a movie with a great plot though, forget this one. It's a pretty simplistic plot. But like I said, if you just liked the Stooges and want a few laughs and a lighthearted movie, you'll probably like this one."
3,The Three Stooges,"For what it is -- mindless, slapstick comedy -- ""The Three Stooges"" does the job. Larry David is great as the orphanage nun tormented by the Stooges, and the Stooges' hijinks and insults kept my kids laughing throughout the movie. Heck, I even laughed a couple times."
4,An Ode to the Original!,"I never really watched the Three Stooges show when I was younger, but I did watch the cartoon, so I could kinda relate to what I was watching.There's no real spoilers that I can think of that are essential to this review so I can do without my usual warning about spoilers.It's got a basic cookie cutter plot where there's an orphanage about to close and these guys have to raise the money to save it and they do wacky things in order to try to raise the money. Moe of course ends up on the Jersey Shore, (but we all knew that from the previews), and does crazy things with those guys. Frankly I was hoping he'd take a sledgehammer to most of their heads but that didn't happen.In the end it was just a great re-living of the good ol' days of slap-stick comedy and corny jokes. Check it out!"
2,This was lame,The dumb funny movies of the late 80's and early 90's are gone. So sad. This is not worth your time.
1,Sad,Did not do justice to the Stooges. It was hokey and cheap.I do not recommend this movie at all!!!
3,The THree Stooges The Movie,The movie was just OK. Could have been better done but there still were a lot of laughs for me
3,Corny,"The film is true to the characterization of the Three Stooges. The actors catch the characterization of the original actors. That being said, the movie is corny. Don't expect to come away from the movie with any deep meaning."
2,Not my thing,"I really did not like it(never did the original either), with that said my 11 year old granddaughter loved it. Too much slap stick and ""dumb"" antics"
3,Okay for harmless fun,"We had heard good things about this movie. So when we were trying to find something entertaining, we thought of this. It's okay for just fun, and it has lots of similarity with the classic Stooges movies. Some of the dialogue was really funny and the sight gags were good, too. It's light and mindless fun."
2,Painful,"The 3 stooge actors did a great job portraying the original stooges, but I have to say, watching all the crazy antics and eye pokes, etc. just got annoying after a while. If you're not a really big 3 stooges fan, I'd say not to bother watching this one."
3,Ok for kids,"This is more a family movie, especially those with young kids, Not really a well made or interesting adult movie. If you are looking for a three stooges movie, get an original"
3,still a feel good movie,"While it is a funny film and true to the Stooges, I just expected more out of it than there was."
5,Three Stooges,New actors held true to form in depicting the original crew. My group and myself had several occasions where we had to hold our sides laughing so hard. Some scenes a little intense. My wife had to leave the room at the chain saw skit. The explanation at the end of how they did the slapstick scenes was redeeming and informative.
2,The Three Stooges,"The disk was no good.I got scamed. It would not play in my CD player,and it would not play on my computer, The disk was no good."
5,jim review,"this movie is really funny. me and my wife enjoyed it, can,t wait for part 2. i would buy it again"
4,"Stupid, But Funny","The Three Stooges: The Movie is a juvenile and pretty stupid movie, but it's also pretty funny and clean fun for the whole family. There are cameos and familiar faces galore, including Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Stephen Collins, Sofia Vergara, and the cast of Jersey Shore. My favorite part was when the stooges are dressed as doctors and nurses at the hospital. Curly is dressed as a nurse and despite making a very ugly woman, gets hit on and asked out on a date. So, The Three Stooges might be one of the dumbest movies of the year, but it's also probably one of the funniest!"
1,Don't be the 4th Stooge by watching this rubbish!,"What an absolutely dreadful movie!Having grown up visiting the local cinema on Saturday mornings, where The Three Stooges were part of the staple diet, I had reasonably high hopes. Added to that, I heard a very favorable interview / review with the one of the directors on NPR, and it sounded like it might be interesting.Having suffered through the movie last night, the bottom line is that rather than being hilariously funny, it is excruciatingly awful for the most part, with only a couple of laugh out loud slapstick moments (they'e all in the trailer... just watch that).What a disappointment!"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,I bought this so I could share some of my memories and 3 Stooges experiences with my young son. A terrible movie and a waste of money.
1,Don't be a stooge,"This is a classic example of the trailer showing the only funny part of the move. I watched the old B&W show as a kid, evidently the people involved with the final product of this movie missed the point somehow. My wife & I got as far as the ""bell"" scene before we turned it off. Too bad you can't get a refund on sucky movie rentals."
2,NO GO,NOT AS FUNNY AS IT WAS ADVERTISED TO BE! IT HAD ITS FUNNY PARTS BUT THEY WERE SPARSE TO SAY THE LEAST!
1,Very Bad,This movie was a bad re-make of the 3 stooges it was stupid and my kids fell asleep. Waste of time
2,No Throwing Pie Scene?,"I don't have too much to say about the movie. The plot was very simplistic. There were a bunch of funny moments, but most of the slapstick made me cringe with embarrassment as to why I was watching this. The actors did an amazing job of capturing the spirit of the 3 Stooges; however, the forced jokes, bland dialogue, and Jersey Shore antics ruin the experience. They would have been better off making 3 mini movies with different plots instead of one."
3,Mildly entertaining; not much to it,"The movie was mildly entertaining. It had a couple really hilarious moments, but they were pretty much all featured in the trailer...if you've seen that, you're not going to get a lot more out of this. Acting was very good however, just wish there was more to the movie.."
4,Entertaining Stooges Tribute,"As opposed to a number of recent spoofs (see Dukes of Hazzard or Starsky & Hutch), I would consider this a fairly entertaining tribute to the original Stooges. There are definitely plenty of funny slapstick spots, with great impersonations and situations. Sometimes the film gets a little silly and the slapstick somewhat violent, but that can be a complaint about the originals as well. Worth a rental at least for fans of Moe, Larry, & Curly or for those amused with quick, silly action."
2,I want my hour an half back,"I wish I could go back in time and slap myself for ordering this movie. He had a few funny moments, but the rest was a snooze fest. Curly was the only character that was good."
2,"Dumb, dumber, and dumbest!",:-( So stupid... waste of money! My 15 year old son thought it was Meh... but laughed a lot. G
4,Funny for the kids,"We enjoyed this film with our 8 yr old boy. He really liked it. I recommend it to all ages, good family fun"
5,"Funny, funny, funny",I was worried before watching this that I would be disappointed. But no. This was the funniest movie I've seen in 30 years. Everyone was laughing through the movie. I only wish there would be another movie. I give it 5 polk in the eyes.
3,Rented for dad,We rented this for my 88 year old father . He laughed and laughed. It seem to bring back a lot of rememories
1,I don't know why a bought it,"I never like them but I gave the movie a chance I was wrong, you know every one make mistake so I did but I bought it I am proud the money spend in America"
1,Must miss,"The Farelly Brothers were fighting bad writing, bad acting, lousy editing and Larry David.The high points were Will Sasso and Sean Hayes; they were dead-on hits as Curly and Larry.The rest of the cast made a just so-so movie about these Three Legends truly awful.At times, it was like trying to watch a Stooges short that featured Joe DeRita instead of The Legend himself, Curly.A real shame, too."
1,shameful,I felt guilty giving it one star. Hollywood screws up a good thing again. Reminds me of the Popeye movie where they had Popeye hate spinach. Oh how brilliant they are in being superior to the original genius. I couldn't get past 20 minutes of this garbage. I am only glad Moe isn't alive to see it. Even the Joe movies were better than this. Awful.
1,WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD,"The worst movie in the history of the world must have the worst scene in the history of the world, and that would be the scene in the hospital with the pee fight wherein newborn infants are used as the weapons. Just awful!"
3,No Kate Upton Bikin Scene!,"Rent don't buy! As much as I enjoyed the 3 stooges for the film itself, I would never pay to buy a Blu-Ray Disc. The thought of some good natured teasing of the Catholic Church (Kate Upton's Nun Bikini scene) was enough to change my mind. The scene was harmless and funny but sadly the Studio caved to pressure and cut it. On the Blu-ray extras there is a distant shot of Kate acting as a pool life guard but not the close-up emerging from the pool the trailer promised. If you love Kate Upton like me, you'll be disappointed."
1,Rating: No nyuks,"As a long-time Stooges fan, I wasn't sure about this. The advance hype was strong, but would updating the story work? There have been other films about the Stooges before, including a TV movie bio that got tepid reviews. Well that movie was gold compared to this. Five minutes after the movie started, we knew we'd made a huge mistake. While the actors' characterizations were OK, the script was dreadful. The Stooges involved in a murder plot? Dueling babies urinating? Tell me it isn't so. Unfortunately, it was. Do yourself a big big favor. Buy the box set with the complete works of the original Stooges on DVDThe Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collectionand avoid this. The Stooges deserved much better than this and shame on their licensing company for allowing this to happen."
1,Blasphemy -- !,"Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp would NOT be very happy about this.... If you're new to the Stooges, buy the real Three Stooges DVD set and find out what real Stooge comedy was all about...not this unfunny trash! If you already are a serious Stooges fan -- well, I don't have to tell you anything you don't already know about this insult."
4,Liked It A Lot,What can I say? It was funny and they did a great job of reviving those classic characters. I hope they make another one. :)
4,4 thumbs up,"if you're a baby boomer, chances are you grew up watching officer Joe Bolton introducing the Three Stooges on your old black and white tv.i enjoyed seeing the antics played again. story line was ok, but would appeal to the young ones!BTW, the casting was awesome!!!"
3,very funny,I grew up with the 3 stooges so I was waiting to see this and the 3 comedians did a great job
3,A fair tribute,I think that the actors did a pretty good job of capturing the three stooges characters however the story plot was kind of goofy and boring. In addition I could not get this dvd disc to play in two different players and was only able to watch it using my pc.
3,funny but not as funny as the original,"My review may be biased as when I was younger I got to watch the original Three Stooges, and they always cracked me up. As to this new version, well it had a few moments, but overall it was really corny and not as funny as the originals."
3,Movie,"If you like the Stooges, you'll like this. It is a modernized version of the classic story. Only get if you are a true Stooges fan."
2,The Three Stooges The Movie,"My suggestion if there is even a thought of a sequel is please don't do it. Let the Larry, Moe and Curly legacy ""rest in peace"". This particular effort wasn't close to how the original Stooges performed their slapstick comedy."
3,poor substitue,This was a poor substitue for the original 3 stooges. Curly was the only character to come close. I do realize it is difficult to take the original of the old classic comedy and remake them. Little rascals is another example. People that grew up with these will find it difficult to adapt to the new ones.
4,F. Scott and Zelda by Scottie,"For those interested in fuller background on the F. Scott and Zelda sage, this book is well worth reading. Scottie's own journey one of complexity and pain."
5,Rossini/Suppe - a great combo,"Any aficionado of classical music will instantly recognize all of the selections on this album. The quality of the production is fantastic, and I would recommend this version to any fan of the works of the two composers. Without sounding too lowbrow about it, this is an album that can be enjoyed by any music lover. There are various familiar themes that have become a part of our musical culture (example - William Tell Overture)and those themes will be familiar even to those who are not given to an appreciation of classical music. Excellent Album!"
1,Simply horible,"I tried to watch, promise... but acting is so bad that I had to stop after 35 minutes. In one episode you can actually see a typist moving fingers in mid air for the lack of a typewriter. That is how all movie is - it is like a cheap school theater."
5,Great film!!!,"I was very pleased with this film's storyline. Macolm McDowell protraying the Devil was awesome, but of course being a Christian; I was on the side of the young law student Luke O'Brien. The supporting cast were also very good in their performances."
5,the best movie,A movie you must see tells you that the devil does not love does not care for you all the devil wants is your soul which you should not give it to him. You give it to Jesus Christ who died on the cross for you so you may live with out sin Jesus loves you
1,Save your money,"This movie appeals to the hardcore born-again Christian right and nobody else. It speaks to them in a way that normal movies don't because it's basically telling them what they already believe.The acting for the most part is poor and the only shining light is from Malcolm McDowell himself. He plays a great devil but even he isn't capable of carrying the entire movie by himself. The rest of the cast is pretty forgetable but this wasn't made for entertainment purposes, this was made to spread the gospel.So really, if you're looking for a Christian movie and don't care about the acting, the lead, the directing or anything other than the Christian message then this movie is for you. If you want something engaging or at the very least watchable, check out something else."
1,Christian reviewer thinks this movie REALLY bad.,"Wow, this is a total stinker. I really like Malcolm McDowell and have been a long running fan of Sizemore, but there is no star power that could have saved this movie from such bad writing and directing. If you are looking for a Christian movie that isn't completely painful to watch check out Courageous. Do not listen to the other reviews ranting about how great it is. This movie has no substance, it merely panders to a belief system. This is really a poor movie."
3,Suing the Devil,"(Actually, I'm the husband!) I think the premise was great and the movie fair. I'm one for more 'parlor tricks' and such, which there are some, but I was hoping for something more akin to Oh God!/2/3 with George Burns. Remember those? Sweet little story but it's just cool when George 'proves' he's God.I agree w/others about the campiness of some actors but the tone of the script was as such. This wasn't written to be anywhere near or between an Omen or even Devil's Advocate so for a break and to hear some good lines that will give you something to think about, give it a try.Movie buffs will probably watch because of Malcome but if you're only a casual viewer, especially online, you can skip."
2,"The message is good, but....","Premise: Satan doesn't want people to believe in him, believers in Jesus have power over him. Biblical and true. Problem with this movie is that it just falls short of being humorous enough to get the message across through satire and just serious enough (like ""Courageous"" and ""Fireproof"") to be considered a quality Christian film. It does have some ""moments"" like the news show segments with Corbin Bernson, but overall, not really a quality film. Too bad. I would love to recommend it and as an evangelical Christian, would love to support the creator of it. Unfortunately, it supports the premise of those who think that all ""Christian"" films are second rate. Good message... bad acting. Even Malcom McDowell couldn't help this film out. Biblically: 5 stars, Critical artistic review: 1 star, so I'll give it a 2. I really wanted to like it but..."
1,Made for A Religious Audience,"This movie is cloaked evangelism. I rented it because of Malcolm McDowell expecting not quite ""The Devil's Advocate"" but at least something on the level of ""The Devil and Daniel Webster."" I was disappointed. With the exception of McDowell, the acting was terrible. The dialogue is at best hokey, and filled with gems like ""the bible has been the most reliable source of history than any other ever produced"" all while Christian rock's greatest hits play on the soundtrack. I would have rather donated $3.99 to my local church and seen it put to a better use than this movie."
3,good try...,"If only they had better protagonists, it would've been a great movie... I'll wait until its on prime before buying"
2,Just Okay,"The movie was just okay. The previews sparked my interest, but it appeared to be a low budget film. After about half the movie I became disinterested."
1,"Terrible, poorly acted movie","I am a Christian. I love Christian films. I work in a Christian bookstore. This movie is terrible. I would never recommend it to a customer. I bought it because the trailer was so good, but the movie was poorly acted and could have been much better than it was. The writing was terrible and at times comical because of how stupid it was. I would not watch it again and really wish I had spent my time watching a different Christian movie such as ""The Perfect Stranger""."
5,Inspirational Film - A Must See For All!,"Suing The Devil is the perfect blend of entertainment and inspiration, with Malcolm McDowell delivering a stellar performance as Satan. Director Tim Chey uses the courtroom to explore the battle between good and evil, artfully combining both comedic and dramatic moments throughout the film. In this day and age, it is especially valuable to choose uplifting films such as this one with real heart. Suing The Devil is family friendly, and a must see for all!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out based on its description, but it was terrible! Poor acting and directing - very ""B"" movie quality. If you want an outstanding evangelistic movie, check out ""The Encounter"", best movie since Facing the Giants."
2,???????,"I wanted to like this one, I really did. I even watched it twice. It couldn't seem to make up it's mind if it wanted to be a comedy or just grossly over the top. I really enjoyed this director's other movie, ""The Genius Club"" and have watched it multiple times. I think this one misses the mark. It just isn't that good."
1,Wow...crappy flick at its worst...,"This movie was pure crap. The acting was horrid with the exception of McDowell who played Satan. As some reviewers were saying, none of these arguments would win over anyone because none of them made sense. It was as if they were saying Jesus exists because the Bible told me so. Or that everything in the Bible is correct just because it says so. Simplistic to the core. Hard-headed and very gullible christians I'm sure will love this, but for the average person, it's just plain old ridiculous. I watched it late at night while I was cleaning and I tried to make a concerted effort to really pay attention to it. I actually watched to the end but I really wish I had picked another movie out.It's a movie that Bible-thumpers can watch to feel better about themselves, but it won't save anyone."
1,This one is beyond bad...and not campy. Religious Propaganda,"I usually enjoy things featuring Malcolm McDowell.Clearly, he has fallen on desperate hard times...I can imagine no other reason to lend hi s name or talent to this witless, awful piece of propaganda.This is why people veer away from movies marked ""family friendly"".No where did it mention the hard push for Jesus, a personal relationship with Christ, or anything else that was included...in the FIRST five minutes. I have a lot of non-christian friends who would be offended to be roped into this proselytizing nightmare.I complained, and got a refund...but unless you are a hard core Christian, this is not for you."
5,"The ""Devil"" is in the details!","This is one strangely unique and different movie. We do live in a sue-happy culture, but this just takes litigation to a WHOLE new level.Apparently the hapless hero of this tale rashly and angrily decides to make Satan the scapegoat for his, and all the world's problems, and no doubt means it to be a symbolic gesture, but there is just one problem. The Devil won't let him off the hook that easily, and personally answers the summons.What follows after is a madcap courtroom battle between these two adversaries, with the outcome anyone's guess until the final moments.Dramatic, suspenseful, thrilling, and droll in certain segments, this is a movie that will definitely make you think about the spiritual realm."
2,disappointed,"Waste of money. I didn't even watch it all. I guess I thought it was going to be a little more like a thriller or something or at least a little more real. But, instead it was cheesy and not even ""good"" cheesey.... more like store brand cheesey."
1,Horrible Movie!,"This movie was the worst Religious themed movie I have ever seen. Completely stupid in every way. Poor acting and a very poorly made movie. It had the potential to be a good movie but the way it was done made it seen just stupid. A complete waste of money and I didn't even bother to finish watching it. Save your money on this one nd wait for it to be in the 5.00 bin because trust me, it will be."
2,could have been more,"This movie had some of the worst acting imaginable. It was painful. I expect more especially from McDowell. Also, the comedic aspect was very ambiguous. Not funny enough to be a comedy, but not serious enough to be a drama."
1,Suing The Devil Review,"This movie did not live up to my expectations. The acting was stiff and amature (even with professional actors). It did deal with Spiritual issues but not in a manner you would expect Satan to deal with them. The main Christian character never prayed, seldom opened a Bible, but did quote a lot of Scripture toward the end.I waited over a month to receive this movie. It was not worth the wait. I would not purchase this movie again."
1,Suing The Devil,"What a God awful movie, (that's an hour of my life ill never get back). As always Malcolm McDowell, Rebecca St. James were good but the movie was poorly written, even for a christian film, it was awful. Stay away from this one.Suing The Devil"
5,5 Stars!!,"""Suing The Devil"" is a very moving, and powerful drama about one man's struggle to come to terms with himself.There is a saying that ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation"", and that is illustrated quite accurately in this film, although there is also the light at the end of the tunnel, despite all the challenges our hero faces.Indeed, the Devil is very central to this plot, and the way he tries to make our intrepid Luke O'Brien very miserable indeed must be seen to be believed!"
5,Tasty,"Use it in casseroles, stews, soups and rubs for your meat. Use it everywhere except your coffee. So glad I bought it. It's fantastic."
3,"Good, but EXPENSIVE!","This is a good-quality smoked paprika and will work well in just about any dish you need it for. BUT, the container is quite small and contains only 2.6 oz. For less than a dollar more ($.64, to be exact), you can get McCormick's version, which tastes virtually the same, and you get 8.5 oz. - which is three times as much. In addition, like the Chiquilin, the McCormick paprika is made from Spanish red peppers that are smoked over wood planks. Finally, it is available with Prime shipping, just as the Chiquilin is."
5,Will buy this again.,Excellent flavor. Love the tin. A bit expensive. Need to compare other Spanish paprika before I know for sure what I think.
5,This smoked paprika is supurb!,"If you want a super smoked paprika, this is the one! Far better than regular ""paprika"" you find in the grocery store or even the ""Spanish paprika"" you find in some of the better stores, but if you like a smooth, smoky, mild flavor, this is it, folks! Excellent in all recipes we have tried, and really yummy on deviled eggs. I recommend it highly!--Bob"
4,Suffers only in comparison,"This is a fine reading of the play but not the one of choice only because the Harper Audio version is a far more poetic reading with Anthony Quayle's magnificently doomed reading of Macbeth. Also I am not too sure the use of Scottish accents helps in any way. You might argue it more ""authentic""; but how authentic is it to speak in iambic pentameter? I own both versions and will switch between them. But my desert island choice would be the one with Quayle."
3,"Lengthy, but good for managers who want to enable change","Well, it's for managers who want to enable change *and* have a lot of free time. This book is fairly long for the amount of information in it, and drags on, even if you're a speed reader. Still, there are some great ideas early on about change agents, how they work, and the environment they require to succeed. It's worth reading at least that part of the book, if you're a manager. However, as a technical leader or 'change agent' yourself, there's not much in this book for you."
4,Not really the worst book ever,"Though I wouldn't call Disappearing Moon Cafe the BEST book ever, I would hardly go as far as to call it the worst. Comparing it to works such as Six Records of a Floating Life is, furthermore, problematic; the distinctions between Chinese literature and Chinese-Canadian literature are far too vast to place in the same category.I would recommend this book to anyone, though it is definitely a very slanted view of the Chinese-Canadian experience. It does draw out certain important points, however: the divisions between the Chinese immigrant and other races, the effects of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the role of identity, and both family and interracial relationships. It is DEFINITELY a very intriguing read."
5,Great book,"I really did love this book and how it depicted Vancouver's Chinatown in the past. It was a story, not a true tale of someones life. I'd read it over and over again."
3,Smaller than expected,"I ordered this for my larger birds- a mealy Amazon and a blue-front Amazon, and having received it, I have to report that it is no way big enough for medium-to-large Amazons or similarly sized birds. They would destroy it in 10 minutes!Luckily, I also have two smaller birds (a Pionus and a spectacled Amazon), for whom it is perfect.It is a nice toy-just not as big as I thought it was going to be."
1,"Very unhappy, product overpriced, want to return product.","My husband purchased this product with the idea of learning about how to use excel, it does not work. He was so frustrated and unimpressed that he is very, very unhappy. How can he return the product and why was the product so expensive and it did not deliver the results as it specified in the ad. Very unhappy."
3,nice and simple,it was good I did like it just not as well as the sims 2 but still good and it was fun
3,Awesome deal,"If you ever considered getting the Sims. This is the set to buy. Back when my sisters and I started playing it was around $40 dollars for the original game and then $20-$30 for each expansion (and we got them all up to Unleashed). The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because with the Sims 2 coming out it will quickly be obsolete but if your computer can't handle the Sims 2, I would still recommend this."
5,Simply fun,"The Sims Mega Deluxe is a good deal. To buy the Sims and these expansions seperately would cost quite a bit more. If you haven't tried this game yet, buy it today. Don't think about it. Just buy it. And if you get sick of the same furniture, skins, etc, there's plenty you can DL for free off fan sites."
4,great quality,"although it was not genuine leather, the quality of this product inside out was excellent and I can see it lasting a VERY long time. Got it for my boss and he seemed to love it. Im sure the strength of the faux leather will put up with all the beatings that this job entails. Will definitely recommend!"
3,Didn't last very long...,"The lens on one got broken (may have been neighborhood childrens' pranks), and I couldn't get a replacement lens locally, anywhere.Seems they've been discontinued, and thus, lenses would cost too much in trouble and money, to replace.As a result, the bulbs went into other fixtures, as they are still kickin'..."
2,Loose tip,"The glasses are great, convenient and ready to use in my shirt pocket. The pen is another story. The tip containing the pen kept falling off until I installed a tiny pin to hold it in place. The pen itself does not write very well."
2,just plain disappointment will make you just shake your head....,"bought because of the collection of great games but i forgot to do my research .so basically all the games are wrong. sinistar is broken you cant turn just jolt in different angles ,robotron you cant strafe, and defender just doesn't seem, right joust never cared for so i didn't even trystay away even at $5 i feel like i got robbed"
3,"A fun book, but dated and not discriminating enough.","My wife and I love to go out for breakfast and Seattle has some terrific restaurants and cafes that are open early. So when some friends gave us this book and we didn't recognize a lot of the establishments in it, we thought we'd landed on a gold mine! Unfortunately many of them weren't familiar to us because they no longer exist. Another disappointment is that the authors aren't very critical in their reviews. When every review has only good things to say, they run the risk of becoming meaningless. So why do I give it 3 stars if I only have bad things to say about it? Because even if you only find 2 or 3 new breakfast places in this book, it will have been worth the $9.95 you spent! Now if the authors would just update it for us... :-)"
5,Another Great One by Chuck,"Chuck's released another winner! I have several others of Chuck's, and I especially loved Listen and In a Heartbeat. This one is just as good as those. Full of quality guitar playing, great compositions, and great playing by the other instrumentalists. I of course love Chuck's guitar playing and style throughout but I also really dig Kirk Whalum's sax on True or False, and Andy Snitzer's sax on Fundamentally Sound. Carmen's vocal on Love is All There is doesn't do much for me, but it's not annoying either.If you're new to Chuck Loeb pick up this, or Listen or In A Heartbeat. If you already love Chuck Loeb, you'll enjoy this too."
2,Developed a crack,"I've been a previous owner of a faucet mount PUR filter that lasted for over 4 years before it finally broke. I purchased this particular model thinking that it would also last, but I was disappointed. A couple of months later, it deveolped a hairline crack just below the filter indicator. I thought I just might have accidentally hit the housing, so I purchased the same model again. Well, this same crack appeared, and now I have contacted P&G. I am seriously thinking of purchasing a different brand."
3,"Great water, but poor construction","I've been using this product for almost two years and it's been kind of a rough ride. The water tastes great and the cartridges usually last at least two months for my family, and we drink a lot of water.The problem lies in the construction of the unit itself. I have to replace the little rubber o-ring inside the hinge of the filter unit every two months or so as it begins to tear and allows the faucet to leak considerably. Also, a leak has formed at the edge of the life indicator window, threatening to shoot the user in the abdomen every time the filter is used.The water is great. The cardridges last an acceptable amount of time but are expensive (as are they all.) The construction is somewhat shoddy and you'll want to replace yours within a year or two."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!,"This is the 3rd or 4th Pur water filter that I've had. The first few times I tried the models without the ""filter-life indicator"" window. All of them eventually leaked and had to be discarded. With the model that I now own, I have had exactly the same problem as described by others here - half-way through the very first filter, it started leaking from the indicator window - at first it was a slow leak but after a few weeks turned into a spray that gets all over you. In general, these Pur filters do not last very long, and this model with the clear window definitely has a design defect - I would warn anybody to avoid purchasing this item or similar Pur faucet filters. I'm going to try a Brita filter."
1,No water pressure!,"Water tastes better, but at the expense of any water pressure! Within weeks of installing a new filter, there is barely a trickle coming out & the washer is leaking water all over the place. I've tightened the washer & replaced the filter countless times at this point, trying to fix these problems. Very annoying & totally impractical!"
1,Cracked in 4months,It developed a crack at the indicator after 4 months. Poor design. Never buy again.
2,"Not worth the money - look for another one, a better one!","I've had 2 of these exact filter systems and both had the same issues.By mistake I bought a 6 pack filter re-fill with the first system that I got, but the system went bad after about 4 months - It developed cracks and plastics started to fall apart. But I still had 5 re-fills left that I didn't want to throw away after paying quite a bit of money for them. So I bought another system, so I could use up all the filters and well enough about 1 year after it has the same problems. Luckily I am going through my last filter right now and I am definitely buying another brand this time.While the idea of this system was great it definitely needs a lot of quality improvements, so it can actually last for few years at least.I gave it 2 stars, because I do think they did a great job on the design part of this system, but the quality of it would not pass a one star rating."
3,"Great When They Work, But They Don't Last","I've been using faucet mount filters for 15+ years. Pur, Brita, Culligan. Sixty dollar+ higher end models or the twenty dollar ones. None of it matters. They all suffer from the same problem. They just don't last. But I guess if they did, the companies wouldn't make much of a profit.Usually problems are that the body cracks or the connect at the faucet will fail to hold. It can only be re-tightened so many times before it just will not anymore. How long after the purchase a failure happens seems to be the luck of the draw. For me, it has happened within weeks. One lasted just over 2 years. The average for me seems about a year. Sometimes the failure can be patched or just suffered through for a time, but sooner or later it will have to be replaced. The one I'm about to replace is just over a year old.I stick to the twenty dollar ones these days."
2,Lasted Two Months...,"This unit worked fine for a couple months, then the chrome shell on the bottom of the filter unit fell off as well as the shell on the faucet connection. Also, the unit leaks from the filter status viewing window. Filling anything larger than a drinking glass is problematic if anything else is in the sink because the unit sticks down so far. I am now considering an under the sink reverse osmosis unit."
2,"needs better sealing, cracks and leaks everywhere!","positive:+ Usage meter seemed to work well (clear when filter is new, gradually filling an orange bar when time to replace)+ Cheaper than bottled water (but taste not nearly as good)negative:- Filters slowly- Sprouted hairline cracks and leaks in less than a month- Not much difference in taste vs plain unfiltered tap water- Hot water is like kryptonite to the filter, i.e. completely ruins itbottom line:Relatively low cost option for (supposedly) clean(er) water, but the cracks and leaks make me want to look at other options."
1,Doesn't Last Long,"I've bought two of these water filters and they last less than a year. For the first few months it works great, but after that it leaks out of the back and currently sprays out."
1,It cracks out within a month!!,"The purifier has been a pain. When we bought it first, it cracked out in a month's time and water splashed out of it the moment the water tap is turned on with the purifier. We exchanged the piece for a new one and the problem repeated within the same time frame. The only difference this time was that there were several cracks and water was all around on using the purifier. I would not suggest ANYONE to buy this one. It is a complete waste of money."
4,Awesome water,"The filter fits real nicely on the faucet and it's very simple to install.I especially like the fact that it's not fixed in one position like the old models,and you can rotate it to move out of your way while doing dishes.The quality of the water coming out hopefully is as good as it tastes, which is great.I'm very pleased with this purchase, I just wish I could have gotten a black one.sigh."
2,"""New"" & ""Used"" R Not The Same","I have purchased this 4rm somewhere else b4 but since I needed a new one & was shopping here, I decided to get it. Problem is, it flowed slowly, so very slowly; I just threw it away. This problem (slow flow) usually occurs only after months of usage. New ones do not have this problem meaning I was sent a used one.When I bought a ""new"" textbook a few months ago, it came with some pages already highlighted. Tell me, how does a new book have highlighted pages?"
1,Cheap as can be,"It's amazing to me how cheap and poorly designed this filter is. The faucet adapter is cheap soft plastic that only has a few threads on it. Obviously not enough to hold the weight of the filer, especially when it is full of water! It has come off several times, and now it is stripped. It a metal adapter too much to ask? I will call P&G tomorrow and see what happens. The thing is only about 6 weeks old. Never again."
1,Doesn't work for us,"I'm not sure if it's the fault of the filter or our water pressure, but the filtered water comes out at a trickle (the unfiltered comes out fine). Very frustrating. I bought this for our office in lieu of using a water cooler, but it looks like we will have to go back that route. Too bad."
2,DO NOT BUY,"I have used PUR filters since they first came out - a LONG time. At that time, they were the best bang for the buck, easy to use, good filtration, and cheap. Various leaks and issues would develop over time (some lasted longer than others), but the company *always* stood behind the product and would replace via the mail (then they started issuing vouchers only, which I typically lose before using).But with this new one - filters do not last as long as the old model; the on/off lever is TOO easy to turn - you are not supposed to run hot water through the thing (company says the filter should be replaced if so) - but it is impossible to prevent - we are constantly flipping the lever by accident - it is a real pain.And most importantly - I contacted the company several times - NO RESPONSE. I will not buy another.This is not the same product or company - they no longer ""deliver."""
1,YUCK,"The adapters that come with the filter don't fit right and they leak water. I called and had new filters shipped immediately, but they didn't work right either. I don't think that there is a female thread in the inside of my faucet, just a ridge. I don't think any adapter would work, when the inside of a faucet is not originally made to hold a filter like this."
1,You will get sprayed with water! Poor design!,I have a typical kitchen faucet and after 3 months the seals on this gave out. I spent too much money and now have two filters that I cant use. Do not buy this product!
1,One click falls off the faucet!,I bought not one but 2 thinking maybe it is me! After installing the PLASTIC faucet connection the one click connection fell off the faucet both times. The plastic part that screws onto the faucet popped off. Both of these I screwed on hand tight I did not use any wrenches especially since the piece is made of plastic. I bought a PUR because the first one lasted so long. If I can find a PUR that has metal threads for the faucet I will try that but I don't know if the quality is what it used to be.
4,Very pleased with product,"I was somewhat nervous about buying this because of the mixed reviews, but so far I have been very pleased with my unit. I have had it for 1 month and have had no problems with it until today when it did come unscrewed from the faucet, but nothing was broken, cracked or damaged in any way and it snapped right back on without incident. For that I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I love the taste of the water and have increased my intake significantly and so has the rest of my household."
1,Crack below the clear site window,"I have to agree with all of the other people whom left a 1 star review. I too have had mine for about a year and it started leaking below the site window. It started soon after my third filter replacement. I did not keep my receipt, so shame on me, but that will not happen again."
5,It Just Works,"Have had other PUR faucet filter types before, but this one is the best design so far. The vertical configuration keeps it out of the way for the most part. I also like the finish on the gray, or matte silver, colored model because it doesn't show the water spots like the chrome or the dirt like on the white ones.Bottom line is that it just works!"
1,"flimsy, developed cracks",just another review like the others. started out nice but became unusable before it was even 1 year old. Now I'm just filling space b/c Amazon insists on having a 20 word minimum. Why should I waste 20 words on another crappy filter?
2,Leak,"Don't waste your money. when I placed it on the faucet it clearly didn't fit right, and leaked from around the point of contact. I dont wanna call Amazon n tell,em about the problem then sent the one i have then wait for the new one, Pur developed this system so bad im dessapointed"
4,Apartment Dweller's clean water,"I purchased this Vertical filter as a replacement for a horizontal one that had died after 2 years. It was difficult to remove the cap without tools(each time scratching the surface) and eventually this lead to excessive leaking where it mounted on the faucet.The multi-unit filtration systems are most likely a better option for home owners, but for an apartment dweller this little gem (even the old one) pay for themselves in good clean tasting water right from the tap. The new vertical unit is much easier to change the filter on, the new mounting system a ""snap"" and leak free. The instructions are vague, so electrical connector up on the cartridges, and they work fine. No idea how, but they work great.Over all: Nice improvements and good work by the people at PUR."
2,It cracks many times,"I have been loyal to Pur for a long time, but after the 2nd or 3rd filter, it cracks. I always replace the filter the moment it flashes red signal. The previous version works better."
2,Proctor and Gamble - Kinda cracked for putting out such a bad product.,"I'm on my third and I'm finally throwing in the towel. Each one cracked just as others mentioned. The reason I've stayed with this product is that it's much cheaper overall when you factor in filter life. In the past, I've used the Brita faucet mount water purifier. The Brita filters seem to only last a week or so. With the Pur product, I've found the filters last much longer, 'bout a month.I'm really surprised that P&G; seems completely in the dark about this massive product defect. I searched high and low to find a consumer feedback phone number for P&G;, none seems to exist. I wonder if they think that it's a feature of the product to turn your kitchen faucet area into a child's sprinkler."
2,QUALITY GONE?,"I am having problems with the ""PUR 3 Stage Vertical Faucet Mount""(chrome). After ordering two, one cracked during installation at the attachment point and leaked, the other leaks from the filter change indicator. I Have never had problems with these type filters until recently. Change of materials or quality of manufacturing?"
1,I wouldn't buy another one,"I see other good reviews, so I may just be one of the unlucky buyers. It was great until the indicator said I was about 1/2 way through the filter life. Never had any problems with taste or anything, but it started shooting water out of the clear window where you view the indicator.At this price, it's too cheap, I tossed it and bought another cheap brand until I can afford a much better quality filter, which will probably be when the new one needs a filter change.I really didn't want to fuss with the warranty process (if it's even still under warranty). It was also very difficult to get the old filter out."
1,"""Amazingly, it leaves behind healthful fluoride"" ?","On box it says ""Amazingly, it leaves behind healthful fluoride, along with a clean, fresh taste!""Now I don't know about you but I have learned that fluoride is highly toxic (a by-product of aluminum manufacturing) it is also one of the main ingredients in some RAT POISON. I want a water filter to REMOVE fluoride not promote it!!! Do some research, fluoride is toxic and we have been programed to believe it helps reduce tooth decay! GET THIS: The ADA recently came out and said that too much of it actually creates tooth decay! Insanity..........."
1,Faucet attachment breaks frequently,"The plastic attachment to the faucet breaks easily. At the moment, we are on our third replacement and the plastic ring tends to break after 4 - 5 months. There does not seem to be a replacement, so one has to buy a completely new system."
1,Poor Quality Killing the Pur Brand,"Shoddy quality in the last few years has caused leaks, small cracks & spraying of my last 3 Pur Faucet Mounted Systems.The filters are great, the housing that attaches to the faucet which holds the filter have become junk. They last for six months or so and then start leaking, cracking and spraying everywhere.Have had to ask P&G; to replace twice in the last 12 months alone and am ready to look for an alternative. Too bad, I've been a Pur customer since before it was acquired by P&G.; Quality has gone down hill steadily since, but the price hasn't. Their customer service response says they are surprised to hear of the quality issues. Obviously, from the other posters I see here, it really isn't a surprise to anyone. If I were P&G;, I would be feverishly looking to fix the quality issues pronto before the Pur brand loses all its loyal customers."
3,3 Times for Pur and Does Work!,"Ok...the plastic housing is cheap and cracks. I have bought 5 of this very model. Big Deal. They last about a year before the cracks start forming...but I have had the water tested, and they DO WHAT THEY CLAIM...excellent filtration. If $30 a year is the cost for chemically clean water, ok...where do I sign? On the up side, if PUR would build a higher class model, that could live through chlorine (that is what is cracking the plastic)...then I would spend the $55 to buy that model, instead...as it is...ante up for the $30 and don't complain...imagine how much the bottled stuff at the store is. OR...you could always buy a refrigerator tank, to tie up space, leak in the floor, spill on the counter...well, you get the idea."
2,Horrible build quality,"This is a review for the faucet system, not the filter. The filters are excellent but this particular faucet system has horrible build quality. I have been using this for 3+ years and finally gave up on them. Since you twist the WHOLE filter and not just a knob like in other systems, it is bound to produce leaks and cracks. My last 5 filters have all been P&G; replacements, and they are quick to send a replacement coupon.The only good reason i can think of with these are that there is a nice red bar for filter life indicator which is really a Gallon counter and has nothing to do with actually measuring the life of the filter. If you open the filter system and take out the filter and put it back in halfway through the filter life, it will reset the status bar (you should have a good reason to do so! )"
1,I would give this a zero if I could....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I would give this a zero if I could. I have not had it a month, and I noticed water dripping from the back of the nozzle attachment on the faucet, so I tried to take it off and adjust it. Now the screw on attachment won't even turn, so I can't even put it back on the facucet. There is no way I could use pliers or a wrench to force it loose, as it is plastic and would surely break. I have had it all of three weeks, so I am going to try to return it to the store and look for another type of water filter; possibly another pitcher type."
2,Product Mount Failure Resposible for the Low Rating,I purchased 2 of these filters because the actual filter is very good but unfortunetly the mount failed after 2 weeks of installation. The screw on portion is thin plastic and does not hold up under normal faucet useage of hot and cold water passing through the non-filered area. Eventually the the threads will no longer keep the unit mounted on the faucet and it blows off. I'm currently trying a different brand (4th brand) and will report on it in the future.
1,Broke after only 6-Months,"I had been using the other model that lasted years but they changed the design and material(to cheap plastic).The design also not right. Every time when we use it it pushes it up a little because the water forces it upward.This is the 2nd, since they changed the design that lasted only 6-months.One had the threads worn out and it popped up every time we used it.The 2nd one is literally broke from the thread.I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN AFTER ALL REFILLS GET USEED UP."
2,Volume too small after couple months not a good one for daily usage,At the beginning the water volume coming out is OK. Then slowly it changed from stream to dripping. It will take half an hour to get maybe one gallon.The light on the faucet is still green so the filter itself is still in working condition.
2,Keep looking,"It worked fine for about four months, then it started leaking. The filters are also really expensive and do not last long."
1,PUR Junk,"Item is very flimsy on your faucet. It is difficult to get it to not leak when putting in the filter. Worst of all it brakes by the first or second filter change. Now i have a box of filters and a busted unit!i have had this one for a year already and changed the filter a few times ""Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter"" - This is a much better unit then the PUR Junk!http://www.amazon.com/Culligan-FM-15A-Level-Faucet-Filter/dp/B00006WNMI/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1324945039&sr;=1-2"
1,Nevery buy this...,"I bought this two weeks ago..It says that it has american standard size..however, it doesn't match with my faucet size and also I called customer service but.there's no response at all..I wanna return this item"
3,Just Okay,"I have had this filter for about two months now. I think it is probably pulling the impurities out of the water but it has not been as good as I would have liked at removing the bad taste. Or, if it is removing the taste in the city water, it is replacing it with a slight after taste. I can't quite put my finger on that. However, I do know that the city recently received a lot of complaints about the quality of water in my part of town, and has changed the source for the water in this area. Magically, the water coming out of this filter improved considerably. I don't know yet if that is causation or correlation."
4,"Affordable, long lasting, and tasty.","I have had this filter for at least 3 years and still love it. For a while I had the ""flavor options"" horizontal model that recently developed a crack in the body that made it completely unusable and brought this one back out of the cupboard and it still works fine (at least a solid 2 years of actual use).It's reliable, affordable to keep filters for, and fits perfectly on the faucet. I haven't tried a lot of other brands, but this has yet to let me down."
4,So much better,"Had 2 of the ones that rotate, and they only lasted a year each, before they broke. This design [FM3700B] is far superior, and hope to get a much better service life, over it's poorly designed {FM3700] forerunner."
2,Dissatisfied,"I received my filter on October 4th. I really liked the product. A little over a month later, the filter started falling off my faucet. My family was sitting in the living room (right near the kitchen) and we heard a noise... the filter just fell off... The adapter & all. I put it back on and tried to use it, same result. It kept falling off my faucet. My faucet had the threads on the inside... not sure if that has anything to do with it BUT am not happy with the product."
1,Works for a month before water loses pressure,"They should rename this a disposable water hose filter because it only runs good for a month before the water barely leaks out of the drinking opening. Even when I changed the internal filter, water would still drip rathern then flow. The problem is the faulty engineering, its NOT durable enough to maintain the constant water pressure the sink pipe puts out so its internal canals gradually degrade and will not give you a big volume of water flow through the drinking opening. The same goes for the Brita unit which also works good about 2-3 weeks until the water barely drips out. These faucet units are very sensative to water pressure and any pressure deviation will screw it up permanantley. Stay away from them and get a proven counter top or undersink reverse osmosis unit. BTW i'd give 0 stars if i could. Its completely worthless and should be taken off the shelves. Surprised consumer affairs hasnt filed suit against the makers of these faucet attachments"
2,Great until it leaks,"I have the ""improved"" version with the snap on faucet mount. Installation was easy and only took 3 minutes from unscrewing the faucet aerator to inserting the filter and snapping on the mount.I've used this regularly for 3 months, but it started to leak after just 1 month. Trust me, the installation is correct, but this new ""improved"" design still leaves much to be desired. The water tastes great, but so much water is wasted through leaking. No matter how many times I try to tighten it, the leaking is ever present. I'll stick to my filtered pitcher for now."
4,Much improved product!,"Just received the new and improved PUR 3-stage faucet mount filter and so far so good (has only been a week). The new snap-on installation is a vast improvement over the past as no more trying to tighten it with pliers and cracking the unit! It was so easy to install that I was sure it wouldn't work properly when I turned on the H2O, but surprise, it works beautifully! Now the big test will be whether it will begin to leak within a few months like past filters. Stay tuned......"
2,Wear a raincoat!,"If you don't mind taking a shower while filtering water, this product is great. The water actually tastes great. The problem is that it sprays water out of the filter indicator. It worked fine for a few months, then kaboom! I'd stick with pitcher for now. The filters a great. The problem is the faucet mount."
2,Appeal to P'R/Proctor & Gamble to fix your product,"I am on my fourth vertical P'R faucet, and my story is similar to the litany posted before me... unparalleled filter performance, but shoddy hardware. Our first one purchased years ago was white and nearly indestructible (until we wrecked it with a heavy saucepan). Every successive unit purchased, whether white or ""chrome,"" has been a study in accelerated failure.P'R/Proctor & Gamble:Why not fix the problem? The filter's proven to be better than anyone else's -- so please fix the hardware, and customers will come flocking to your door!!!"
1,Pitiful,"Bought one and it cracked open and started spraying all over the kitchen. Since I invested in several replacment filters I bought another one. It did the same thing. Obviously this thing is junk. When it worked it did a good job of purifying the water. Unless I can get another one for free, I will not buy another."
4,Much improved from the past,This is much improved from the previous older Pur faucet filters. This is much easier to attach with no leaks as the other did.
2,done with these,"Although this filter seems to do the filtering job well, I am through with this filter. I have been using them for about 4 years now and am tired of replacing the entire unit every year to year and a half or so as they begin leaking and no amount of redo-ing or teflon taping or voodoo fixes it. I feel I am throwing away far too much stuff with the continuous chucking of spent filters and the main units. Not very ecologically friendly. I am done with products that don't last."
3,Cheap = you get what you pay for and maybe a little more,"The price on this is stellar. It's a great way to get filtered water if your water tastes bad or has a high level of contaminants. However, I was surprised to find out that this is ""chrome finish"" rather than chrome. I recommend that if you are looking for a faucet mounted filter, to buy the best you can afford and check the warranty.So far, this one hasn't leaked for me like other reviewers have reported, but with plastic threaded mounts and a plastic filter housing, I am not surprised. The filtration is very good though and the water tastes fantastic."
3,"Model update = good, filtering = meh.","This water filter greatly improves the taste of our hard water that has gone through the softener. Unfortunately, it is not powerful enough to remove the salty taste of the water. It still tastes pretty bad in my opinion.I do like the update to the design which features a plastic lever to move between faucet mode and filter mode. On the old versions of this system, you had to tilt the filter body itself up and down and that was awkward."
2,needs improvement,"Though not very old, my first PUR filter began leaking from the top of the capsule shape. I called PUR and was happy when they said they would send a new one. The new one now has some problem with the battery (unrepleaceable) that shows whether the filter is working or running out. I called them again and they did offer to send another if I sent in the old one, but do I want yet another one that may die off quickly? Also much leaking from where it is attached to the faucet, even with a variety of attachment rings.Will likely change brands at this point."
3,Works fine - nothing special,"I've never tested my water so I can't be for sure, but I think this product works just fine. It's nothing special though, just another water filter. I do find it a bit annoying that you're supposed to run the water through the filter for 5 seconds before filling your glass. I also find that I'm having to change the filter quite often on this, but that may be because I switched to this filter from a amway one that I only had to change a few times a year."
4,Rich Water,"Product quality is excellent, exceeded my expectations. The easy installation system is perfect.I will keep buying these products. thank you very much"
1,R Nair,"The filter look beautiful. But it will not serve the purpose. In the beginning it was giving thin stream of water, then day-by-day the flow reduced and after two weeks it only drips now. I send an email to the company and the reply was it is because the water in the line must be contaminated. I live in Brooklyn, NY and the New York city water supply is considered as one of the purest."
3,Pur-Faucet water purifier,"I have used device previously and couldn't find the one I wanted locally. It works very well and makes a big difference in taste of water. I like the red line feature that tells you when to change the filter.Negative: Previous one cracked before red line indicated a new filter was needed. But positives out-weigh the negatives, so I ordered two to have a spare on hand."
5,Works perfect for me,"now when i saw this product here on amazon i was self doubted on buying it for the horrible reviews but i took the chance anyways and im glad i did, it works perfectly for my sink and love how its looks, in my opinion this is a defiantly buy, but take your chance like i did"
1,Has anyone had supposedly purified water tested?,"I really don't think this thing even filters the water. The first one I ordered had a defective indicator light, it didn't go on, but I called and was assured that it was a separate issue and the water was fine. I had my little water tester from the Zero filter I used to have and it showed the PUR water exactly the same as the tap. I now it is not a state-of-the-art tester but my Briter pitcher water tested @ 80 , my hot tap water @ 170 and the water from the cold @ around 127, the same as the water coming out of the PUR filter! Anyway they sent me a new one. The indicator light works on the new filter but the water tests exactly the same as the tap. It does nothing! I just don't have the energy to fight for a refund. It sucks though because I am not exactly flush with cash. I wish there was a minus star rating."
2,It made out of cheap plastic--does not last!!,"I have been a fan Pur products for 7 years. My old model is made of metal and plastic and it is still going strong. I brought a new one 2 weeks ago. I was disappointed with the quality of plastic and the turn handle is flimy. It was not easy to put on either. The water was leaking all over the place, After frustration of trying to stop the leak, I put my old one back on and no leaks. I followed the directions in the package. I am very disappointed with the cheap plastic new ones. I wish Pur Comapny give back the design of the metal and plastic kind."
1,terrible,"the water tastes bad, maybe I got a defective one. thats what i get for trying to get a bargain :("
1,don't they get it?????,"Purchased the Pur 3-stage water filter system. Then when I had time to throughly read the packaging, I discovered that they do indeed filter out some toxic materials, but then they proceed to filter the chemical FLOURIDE INTO the drinking water and into your glass. In essence they are just exchanging one toxic chemical for another. From my research, flouride is as toxic as the chemicals they are removing. Do your own research on the negative effects of flouride.Don't they get it??? We purchase water filters to PURIFY the water. Hello, is there any living, thinking intelligence on planet PUR??? Isn't it time to wake up and let these companies know how we feel?As for me ---I am returning the one I bought and will continute to look for a filter that gives me purified water WITHOUT additives from chemical companies --- that is, after all, my goal --- to stay healthy in a world that is being bombarded by man-made chemicals."
1,Don't buy this item,"I bought this item for my home.I don't recommend anyone to buy this product, it doesn't worth with your money, you could find a better product. Even if the manufacture said that changes the filter every 100 gallon water, I have to change the filter every week, it costs a lot. I decided not using this item and bought another one, countertop one. I rated this item the worest."
1,Already broken,"I used a previous model of Pur that lasted 2 years until it developed a crack. Thought the ""new"" version might last even longer. No way. Less than a month and it's already broken. I have the same problem as stirer - it comes flying off the faucet when turning on the water - but not before it sprays water everywhere. Really disappointed in this one. Will not buy Pur again."
1,Waste of Money - Faucet Mount Adapter Not Sturdy Enough to Support Unit,"I bought this product about 3 or 4 months ago and have changed the filter exactly once. It no longer stays on the faucet as the mounting adapter threads have stripped. Any amount of water pressure and the whole unit just flies off. This is probably the last PUR faucet filter system I will buy. I've had about 3 or 4 of the older models and after 2 or three filter changes, the plastic casing cracked sending water spewing water all over the place. Still, we got more use out of the older model than this newer model. The faucet mounting adapter is just not sturdy enough to support the weight of the unit in addition to the pressure of the water. I would say don't buy unless P&G redesigns the adapter."
4,much better than the old model,"I have owned three of the older type, they always leaked after awhile, but the new snap on one is much better."
2,Are they serious ?,You have got to be kidding me that their engineers think this thing could last more than a few days.....which is exactly what happened to mine. Installation was not a problem at all as I have done plumbing before.. chose the right adapter..put in the filter....snapped the unit on the faucet...* voilla * ....ran for 5 min as directed. Water had a nice taste to it...THEN ... on the second day as I was filling up my percolator it came flying off.. water flying everywhere...just what I needed at 6 am... took off the adapter and re-screwed it back on...put on Pur unit...water leaking everywheres....this happened twice more before I had enough....BACK IT GOES !!!!! .. I knew it wouldnt last..was so wobbly and lose that there is no way this thing could last. Oh well...guess I'll check out an under sink model...this is nonsense.
5,Good filter,"This filter attaches easily to the faucet and produces a good clean tasting drink of water. Now that I am using it, I hope that it produces the number of gallons of water it claims, before you have to replace the filter. Attractive too. And I like the bypass switch so that you do not waste good water on doing dishes."
3,"Does the job, but are there better options","Have used this Pur faucet mounted filter for a few weeks. I've got hard water in my area so drinking water in my family is either via bottled water or filters. We typically go bottled water first then filtered water if we are out of bottled water...probably because the harder the water, the shorter the filter life seems to be.I found this Pur has worked for me to provide good drinking water. To be honest though, I am not a fan of faucet mounted because it is just too bulky and gets in the way of sink activities and water flow is a bit on the weak side. My preference is filtered pitchers or actual filter system in the basement. But, in a pinch this works for me. Has been durable so far but can't say how it will hold up over time...if anything notable happens I will update this post."
1,"Leaked, cracked","I had used this brand years ago and it was great, apparently they have reduced their standards for durability.Mine developed a leak where it attached to the faucet, no amount of tightening or loosening or o-ring replacement would fix it. This was 1 week after installing. I figured oh well, and kept using it. It then developed two little tiny cracks on the indicator window, out of which squirts the water - across the room.I thought maybe it was just me, I must have done something inadvertantly and just couldn't figure out what it was - then I came and saw the reviews when thinking about reordering. Glad I read the reviews first - seems like many people have had this issue with this product. Badly designed, cheaply manufactured - try another brand."
1,Cracked in less than a year,"I bought my pur Filter some 3 or so years ago at a local retailer.Within a year a crack developed at the filter indicator window.Once it started leaking I epoxied it after sanding the area toget the glue to stick better. That worked okay for about anothersix months when the cracks became longer.I'd rate it a 4 for filter effectiveness as that works.However it is obvious PUR is still selling this defectivegarbage to unsuspecting public. FOr that, it deserves a 1 at best.Culligan looks good. Yeah, it isn't 'at faucet' however the cartridgesare sure a lot less expensive and I'm going to gamble it wont' just crack dueto piss poor product design and production quality."
1,New Model Falls off Faucet after a Few Weeks,"The model shown ofn the picture has been discontinued. The new model is poorly designed and lasts only a few weeks before it collapses.I owned at least five of these filters over the years; they usually lasted at least one year, although they always tended to soon start leaking around the ring that screws to the faucet. The new system seemed improved at first,(it was easier to install) but after a few weeks the plastic ring that holds it could not sustain the normal flow of the water coming down, and became stripped, causing the whole unit to fall down. Customer service has been helpful, repeatedly sending me replacement rings, but they all last only a few weeks. Too bad, because the filter insert did a decent job of removing the chlorine taste from the water."
1,Cheezy cheatin' crap,"Had previously owned a PUR faucet mount water filter that lasted almost five years. Bought this one to replace it & had it less than 4 months when the aerator for the unfiltered water stream completely fell off & was NOT replaceable as any regular aerator would be. It appears to have been glued in & is completely made of plastic. VERY DISAPPOINTED with PUR & am sad to say it. Not to mention, now my confidence level in the actual filtration itself has gone down due to doubt of quality. Needless to say, I will be examining warranty AND country of origin for my next purchase. ABSOLUTELY FED UP WITH CHEEZY CRAP!!!"
2,"Horrible quality, but great tasting water","I first purchased this filter probably 10 years ago and used it for atleast 5-6 years with no leaks or any other issues. When it finally died, I bought another thinking it would be the same. Right away, I didn't like the spray as much as the stream of water of the original but I could live with it. What I couldn't live with is that within just a few months it started leaking at the filter swivel so that water would still pour out of the filter even when turned side-ways, and also water would come out of the faucet even with the filter turned on. It got so bad that more water would come out of the faucet than out of the filter. I replaced it within a year, and the same thing happened again. I just replaced it with the Pur fm-3600 horizontal-mount filter despite the bad reviews."
1,This system is Rubbish,I bought this filter system and installed it. 3 months later the housing developed a crack and water leaked everywhere.I see complaints about this product all over the net. Why doesn't PUR recall this product?I will not buy this product again and will do my best to discourage anyone I know from buying this product.
3,Nice filter / poor quality housing,I've been through two of these filters and both have the same problem.. the bottom seal of the unit leaks and sprays water. I'd rate it lower because of this but it otherwise does a nice job. When it break I just buy a new one and return the old one in the same packaging.
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Once, a long time ago, I used Pur filters in a second house we had and it was perfect. Fast forward to today....without thinking I purchased a PUR 3 state filter......horrible. Why? Probably Proctor and Gamble. I guess this is the way of things in America today....if it works well either do something to change that or sub it out to the Chinese, those paragons of great craftsmanship. The strange thing is they were making top dollar compared to the other water filters on the market but hey...this is a different time and place.....do I feel sorry I bought this? Naw......I do feel sorry for the younger people that have to walk a labyrinth of products to find one that works. Support Made In America"
1,Keeps falling off!,"I can not wait to replace this with one that works! I should say when it stays attached to my faucet it works wonderfully,BUT it constantly falls off, and i am so tired of getting sprayed in the face when it does!! If it stood on the faucet I would give it a 4 stars!"
1,The worst; been burned twice now,"i hate to trash a company but the quality on PUR faucet mount filters has gone to pot. i have been thru two of them in less than a year; after the first one started leaking, i read that perhaps my water pressure was too high. called a plumber, he checked, said my water pressure was actually very low at my kitchen faucet.so, purchased another one, figured i got a lemon. worked fine for 2 weeks, then started spewing (yes, projectile water shot out) the top side. another crack somewhere.so here i sit with a box full of replacement cartridges purchased at Costco...so, I purchased a Brita faucet mount. fingers crossed, this one is a peach (so far).my advice, don't buy ANY filters in bulk at Sam's or Costco."
1,"Cheaply made, poorly designed, leaks, un-usable","I bought this as a replacement for my older model PUR faucet mount which only started leaking after many many years of use. Compared to the previous design, this thing is enormous and occupies a huge amount of space above the sink.The adapter that screws onto the faucet and quick-connects to the device itself doesn't have enough threads to stay secured to the faucet. The faucet-adapter connection leaks the same amount regardless of whether or not the o-ring is installed. Once the filter is attached to the adapter via the quick connect, the resulting additional pressure causes the faucet-adapter connection to become a fountain that soaks anything within a 5 foot radius.After several attempts, the gigantic apparatus simply began ripping the adapter right off the faucet and falling into the sink.This product is simply not-usable, it is made of cheap plastic and ends up damaging itself under it's own weight."
1,Not thrilled - buyer be aware,"This is not metal, though it looks like it in the picture and the word ""chrome"" is used, it's plastic or mostly so, so just be aware. It is ok to set up, but the stream of purified water is very thin. You could be waiting awhile to fill up a pitcher. The head is so big that you had better have a large sink so you can work around it to wash pots/pans and so on, even though it swivels away it's still sort of in the way. It's BIG. You have to remember to switch it back to regular unfiltered water when you are running hot, or you'll blow the filter and filters are not cheap. We went back to the pitcher in the fridge. Not my favorite method, but this as a solution was not what I thought it would be."
1,junk,i would not have anyone get this the unit does not seat tightly around the arm where it clipes on so when you turn the water on it sprays all over the place
1,"Useless, Waste of Money, Over Priced","Pros :It's filters water for a few months ( it breaks, it forms a crack on the side eventually)Cons :Filters are over pricedEventually so little water pours outAfter a few months it cracks or breaksVery fragileWARNING: LOOK FOR ANOTHER FILTER BRAND, SAVE YOURSELF THE $$"
1,Developed leaks after only a month or two of use!,I have used Pur Faucet filter systems for some time and previously enjoyed using it. I had to replace my older one that I had for several years. After purchasing this one it developed several leaks around it in less than 2 months of use. I plan on purchasing another hoping it was just a fluke or an individual flaw. I hope the new one works. I didn't save the box nor paperwork because I never dreamed it wouldn't last the the older model did.
1,This thing cracks like an egg,"After using the unit thru 2 filters, hairline cracks started appearing. So when you would flip the unit vertical for filtered water, water would spray out of the cracks at high velocity. Scared the stew out of me when it happened. So now the unit sits unused, waiting for me to decide what to do. I still have filters left to use, so do I buy the same unit and hope it lasts. Well stupid is as stupid does. This is my third unit. First one cracked, emailed P&G to complain and got a coupon for a replacement. Second one was the stainless steel looking one. It cracked where it joins with the faucet. So here I am with the third one. Somebody shoot me. P&G who owns PUR must know this because it is a chronic issue. They are either stupid or just dont care. Time to shop around."
2,"Great water, terrible construction","The water tasted great, but like other reviewers we had problems with construction. We got cracks in the unit itself, followed by leaks around the faucet seal. This was OK until the entire filter unit snapped off and I had to use a pair of pliers to remove the rest of it from the faucet. It lasted a year, so if you can justify the cost then go for it."
1,All you need is luck,"There is always something wrong with this product.Either a crack, a leak,the cartridges.Just out of the box and it started to fall apart.Yo are lucky if you get 4 months out of this thing."
1,They CRACK and leak everywhere!!,"Ive had 3 of these, first 2 were replaced under warranty but they dont do that anymore. Im moving on to another product. It WILL crack after about a year and start shooting water out in ALL directions. Funny at first then just sucks."
1,Faulty Device. No good.,"I bought one of these and it developed a crack around the indicator. I returned it (I bought it wal-mart) and amazingly enough inside the box was another busted unit. I had to go back to the isle and get another. Wouldn't you know, this one has cracked, too. I noticed it tonight which prompted me to come here and write a review. I'm very disappointed in these."
2,excellent at filtering if it manages to stay on the faucet,"I got this filter when I moved into an apartment in Boston and I knew water filtration was a must. For the first few months, it worked great. Great tasting water with the benefit of not having to wait for the regular Brita to completely filter. But then one day when filtering, the whole thing popped off with a spray of water and a loud crash onto the dishes in the sink. I tried remounting it but to no avail- it will not stay on. I've scoured the internet and have found that other people have had the same issue. Here's another warning- only buy this if you want to deal with cheap plastic threading that cannot handle the weight of the filter and if you want broken dishes in your sink."
1,Weight caused need for $500 Faucet Replacement,"We really liked the idea of getting away from the Pur water pitcher that we had been using for a number of years. We installed the original faucet version of the Pur water filter to our kitchen faucet.We didn't notice, over time our faucet was being compromised by the weight of the filter, until one day our faucet became disconnected from its housing. We ended up having to replace the faucet all together...between the labor and the cost of a new faucet it ran $500+.The silver lining...while we were paying for the plumber to come, we decided to invest in an under the counter GE Water Filter, which is certified by the State to remove a series of VOCs and other ickies....it cost $230, but at least now we know we have a filter system that is solid, with a dedicated faucet, and filtered water on demand.Our advice, go cheap and use the Pur Pitcher, or go all the way...and install an under the counter solution...May your water be plentiful and icky free!"
1,Useless - Will NOT stay mounted on sink,"I bought this water filter and was thrilled with it at first - it was easy to mount to my kitchen faucet and it filtered the water well - great taste and everything.HOWEVER, within 2 weeks it started popping off the faucet every time the water was turned on. I used their mounting hardware that they included and it just doesn't work for long - the filter will not stay attached to the piece that screws into the faucet.So, I got 2 weeks use out of this and that's it. While this is an inexpensive filter compared to some others, only getting two weeks of use out of it makes it a VERY EXPENSIVE and frustrating filter.The whole thing is very poorly designed, as you can see from the other reviews.Save yourself some heartache and buy a different filter."
1,Plastic fraility taken to the extreme,"PUR 3-Stage Vertical Faucet Mount Chrome FM-3700BIf there were anything lower than one star this would deserve it. I installed this replacement for a identical unit on the evening of the 20th and on the morning of the 29th it fell into the sink. The plastic coupler that joins the filter assembly to the faucet is the weakest link and apparently PUR doesn't care because the quality of the pastic is getting worse, not better. I bought this unit because I still have some extra cartridges. For anyone thinking as I did be aware you're probably setting yourself up to spend more money to try and save a little. I would only recommend this as a practical joke gift for someone you don't particularly care for."
2,Makes Water Taste Better,"It definetly makes tap water taste better. But if you think this is a Reverse Osmosis filter you are mistaken.My house has hard water and a PPM of 465 on average. I installed this filter and to my suprise, the PPM's were the same if not, they had gone up.Where as Reverse Osmosis (RO) water is usually around 14 PPM.Taste good, perfromance nill."
1,as bad as everyone says it is,"My wife bought this in a drug store, not on amazon, so she did not see the reviews before she bought it otherwise we would not have gotten it. here's what happened:it worked fine on day 1, though the picture on the box makes it seem like there's a strong flow of water, its a VERY slow run. then as each day passed, the machine would work slower and slower to the point that it was a drip. so we pulled it out and put it in the garbage after 4 days. don't buy this. its a waste of money. the filter gets blocked too easily and too quickly.since then, we got the thin brita jug and it works perfect."
2,restricts waterflow by 75%,"If I had known how much this restricts waterflow, I'd have passed it up. It reduces a full faucet flow to a trickle."
2,Faucet adapter is poorly designed,"We have had this for a few months after replacing our previous generation model. As others have reported, it has started popping off the faucet frequently. The cheap plastic adapter will not stay attached to the faucet.I suspect it can't handle the temperature changes, as plastic tends to expand and contract quite a bit from heat and cold. It would be nice if there was a metal version available, or at least a plastic version with a metal sleeve for the threads.Its really a shame, because it works great otherwise. I really like the general design over the previous generation."
3,It keeps falling from the faucet,The fixture provided with the unit is really poor in quality. It is a plastic and the threads become weak and then the filter just keeps falling...
2,Filters don't Last,"I haven't had much luck with the faucet filters. They just don't last. Also, I have had Pur filters dead right out of the box. Pitcher filters are best. Double filter your water. One out, one in the fridge. Spent too much $ on Pur. Brita is betta!"
4,GREAT BUY,"I really like this product. I was skeptical about it at first but now that I have it, I like it. I live in really old apartments and the lead in my water was always an issue for me. We have bought countless bottled water because I did not want my daughter drinking the water. She is 15 months old and hates the taste of water, but now that I bought this filter, she drinks the water. Great buy!!"
2,Getting ready to pitch my third one,"After our first one leaked, we thought it was faulty and bought another. After a few months, that one started leaking too. We wrote to PUR, and they sent us a free coupon for a replacement. It's been about 4 months now and this one is leaking like crazy too, so now we're looking into other options."
1,"Good water, terrible quality","The water coming out of this filter has always tasted great, but after less than a year, the outside plastic (chrome-colored part) began falling off. A short time later, the whole thing started springing leaks. I'm a stickler for using things ""as directed,"" so this is definitely a quality issue with the product. I'm replacing it with another brand."
2,Cracks and leaking,"The Pur water filter system is very easy to install, and the filters themselves do a fine job. The filtered water definitely tastes better than straight from the tap. In December 2007 I installed one system in my family house and one in a small apartment I keep close to my job. By June 2008 the one in my family house began to leak and spray water at the faucet connection, and could not be repaired. By August 2008 the one in my apartment (which was used far, far less than the other one) had developed three cracks in the housing, causing water to spray in three directions. Judging by the other reviews, this is not unusual.Every product has some built-in obsolescence, I guess, but this is just shoddy. Pur make great water filters. It would just be nice if they would make a quality filter system that won't fall apart after six months."
2,Easy to install but breaks quickly,"This product is easy to install, but considering the price of filters, you'd think they could make it a little more durable. We've used Britta faucet mounts before and left them at previous apartments. We have never had a problem with them, even after years of use. This PUR filter started falling apart after only a couple of months. We've rigged it until we finish up our stock of filters and then we will be buying a different brand. Do not waste your money on this product until they improve the design."
1,Don't Buy. This product develops a crack and sprays everywhere,"About a year into use, my Pur water filter (the type that attaches to the kitchen faucet) developed a crack and sprays water everywhere. I would not recommend this product. I am very disappointed. Save yourself the money and buy another water filter."
1,Falls apart so quickly they should be ashamed to sell it,A complete piece of crap. If I had the original box or receipt I'd be hollering for my money back. Buy a Culligan like we did and you'll be happy.
1,"Shame On You, Procter & Gamble!","As an Ohio native, I always thought P&G; was a good company with good products. Then I bought this piece of crap.I've had the filter on my faucet for less than 3 months and it will not stay - like many others, I've had the threads stripped on the adapter and the filter is now unworkable. It will not stay on the faucet. No replacement adapter is available. I now have an expensive doorstop.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!I wish I'd read the reviews before *I* did!"
1,Piece of Junk,"What a rip off. I purchased defective pur faucet mount filter two times.#1) After 3 months the threads on the plastic screw-in attachment became stripped and now I am no longer able to attach it to my faucet. This small plastic piece should be made of metal and woudl only cost the manufacturers a few extra pennies.#2) After 3 months, several long thin cracks appeared. Water comes squirting out of all the cracks."
2,Leaking again after 4 months of use.,"This is my second PUR Advanced Faucet Water Filter FM-3700B. Actually, the first filter lasted longer than this one. They always seem to start leaking around the seam at the bottom of the cylindrical part of the filter. I have seen many reviews that note the same problem, but I took a chance on it anyway. I do like the quality of the filtered water, but when it starts leaking, it kind of defeats the purpose. I'll be researching other brands."
4,works well,This filter works great and was easy to install. The replacement filters are a bit expensive. I would recommend this product.
2,Not sturdy,"When it was working it's good. It's easy to accidentally flip the switch. It won't last long, it started leaking from the top in 10 months."
5,chrome PUR 3 stage FM37008,Chrome Mount looks great with chrome faucet...it is much easier to use thanthe old type. Just a click and it is on...and another click and the streamchanges to the purified water with just a flick of your finger.Amazon's price was the best I've seen.
4,Best tasting water,"I originally wrote a 1 star review for this filter because the chrome paint was peeling off and looking bad and the unit was leaking a lot.I then ordered a Culligan filter because it was highly rated on Amazon. Imagine our shock when we tasted that water - it was undrinkable. I'm not exactly sure what it filtered out, but it was horrible water.So we reattached the Pur filter, and that solved the leaking problem. Apparently it needed a better fit. And the water tastes wonderful. Yes, the chrome paint is peeling off, and we plan to buy a white filter next time. Most importantly, it's a very effective filter that produces great tasting water.I'm also impressed to see that Pur replied to my post and was willing to make it right. I like that in a company very much."
1,"Leaky, Faulty Filter","I bought this unit ONE MONTH ago, and it already is USELESS.The faucet adaptor they use is a cheap, shallow, plastic one, and it is already stripped from minimal use. The vertical filter is obviously too heavy for the adaptor-- it sits to the side of the faucet, creating pressure on the adaptor. The adaptor withstood very little--no abuse, just water pressure and minimal movement.Within a few weeks, small leaks would develop around the faucet, and it would randomly POP OFF, spraying water everywhere.Unless they fix the faucet adaptor, DO NOT waste your money on this unit, unless you feel like buying another one in a month or two."
2,Works great until it leaks,"We really like the way a series of Pur faucet-mount filters have made our tap water taste. But we've needed five of them over the past six or seven years because sooner or later every one has leaked badly--the average lifespan is maybe 18 months. I've repaired a couple of leaks with epoxy (leaks from the clear filter status window are easy to fix) but some leaks I've been unable to stop. We called Pur on one occasion and they sent us a new unit at no charge, but it would be nice if the quality of their product was a little better.We've also never had 2-3 months use from a cartridge. With two people in the house we get maybe half that (and we flush the cartridges for five minutes when first installed as instructed).When we run out of cartridges we'll look at alternative products, maybe an under-the-counter unit. If Pur put a little more quality into their product we'd stay with it, but having to buy a new filter unit so often is unreasonable."
2,broke within a year!!!,"I bought this pur filter last November for my kitchen and today the part where the water come out just shoot out while I was washing dishes. I first thought it was loose but after a closer look the plasting that hold them together broke. Althought this is cheap but I expect it to be construct to last longer, DO NOT RECOMMAND this product."
1,all plastic product of 2010 Pur 3-Stage water filter,new designe with all plastic parts that does not hold filter tight. when water turn on whole filter just come off since it just snap in installation. old one use to come with all matel parts and last longer too.
1,Add my voice to negative reviews,"Just want to add that the quality of this filter has gone downhill. The original one we owned lasted for several years, but the last two models barely 6 months. And what breaks down is exactly what you see in the pictures, which plainly signals a manufacturing defect across the line: the chome cover on the faucet mount will come unglued and then the plastic window showing filter life will spring a leak and spray all over you.Look elsewhere. Save yourself the hassle.The only reason we keep buying them is a huge stockpile of the filters we purchased back when we got the original faucet mount. who would have thought..."
4,Great so far!,"Been using this for a couple months now and so far it is holding up well. Many reviews say it leaks after time, but I have yet to experience a problem. Installation was easy. Water tastes fine (though mine did not taste too bad before the filter). Change the filter regularly for best results. A solid product so far!"
3,"Improved Design, but not built to last","I have used both Brita and PUR filters and find PUR to produce superior results. This improved mount is easier to install than previous models. It looks pretty nice and does the job. Over time, these filters to experience some buildup from hard water and often wind of cracking after about a year.While this product is good to have in the home, I prefer the PUR pitcher. While it is also made of plastic, seems to last longer without the buildup and cracks."
1,"CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK, AGAIN....","DON'T BUY, MOVE ON TO ANOTHER PRODUCT...The adapter that connects the filter unit to the faucet spout is a CHEAP, CHINTZY PIECE OF PLASTIC that stripped a few month after i'd started using the filter, and now it won't stay on the faucet. WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BOTHER!"
2,Leaks.,"On my 2nd one. The first one leaked at the faucet attachment after 6 months. I thought - okay, so it has a half-life. But I still have filters so I'll just buy another. Well, 2nd day of #2, it leaked same place. Not just leaked but SPRAYED ME 1st thing in the am. Pretty frustrating. Next time I'm trying a different brand. I tighten it, doesn't help - still leaks and sprays all over - if not immediately, then eventually as the first one did (within 6 months). I fiddled and fiddled, with washers and everything and what worked was - I found that if I swore at it just so and loud enough - it would suddenly stop leaking (probably out of fear), but even then only for a few hours. Then - guess what. Yep. You got it. (rolling eyes)"
2,Cracks within a year,"I've been using these filters for about four or five years, and just discarded my third unit after it developed small cracks near the indicator (as others have experienced), resulting in a fine spray of water on to me whenever using the filter. This was not fixable, despite repeated attempts with epoxy and silicone. I finally switched to a Brita unit, the design of which I like much more: it takes up less space, has fewer moving parts, and appears less likely to malfunction.UPDATE:After several more months, I've had no problems with the Brita, and still prefer it to the Pur.SECOND UPDATE:The Brita didn't work out for me; it stopped working after a short time. I'm now using the Culligan, and liking it."
1,"sleek design, poorly constructed","We recently bought the newly designed PUR system for our kitchen sink.It looks really nice and fit easily to our sink but we have replaced it twice within three months because it randomly fell off and couldn't fit back into place.The entire weight of the filter is resting on a tiny piece of plastic that doesn't hold up well.I was hoping the second one would work so it was just a ""fluke"" but we're done with Pur for now!"
3,"Other than the leaking, it works!","It leaks, but it still does the work. It started leaking after the first filter change. But I bought a five pack, so I'll have to be dealing with the warranty company to see what they can do.BTW, here's the number for the PUR water filter if it starts leaking. They will send you a coupon that you can use to get a new one.1-800-787-5463 (1-800-PUR-LINE)I didn't get it right away, so I had to call in to have them resend it."
2,An expensive way to get a cheap product,"I'd seen this unit advertised on television and purchased it about a year ago. It started falling apart almost immediately. The decorative cover on the bottom of the filter unit and the sleeve above the aerator came loose in the first two months. So it went from ""chrome"" finish to just plain ugly. At almost a year, the valve to divert the water can't close so water always flow from both the filter and the unfiltered tap. The three stage filters last a little less than a month before the water stops flowing through them altogether. I've just purchased a countertop unit which will be much cheaper to use.If you do get this unit, be aware than the best price for filters can be had through Amazon if you get a six pack (a little less than $10 dollars per filter). If you purchase them through a local store, you might end up spending $12, $13, or more."
3,Great for the first cartridge,"I've had this filter for about 2 years now and just replaced the cartridge. It worked fine with the first cartridge. The water tasted great. However, once the cartridge was replaced, the indicator area began leaking upon every use. Slowing the flow to a trickle seemed to stop the leaking, but then, what would be the point?"
1,"tried 3, all breaks after 2nd change","Very poorly constructed, each of them broke and started leaking water and bypassing filter after 2-3 filter changes. I bought a 10 pack filter, so had no choice but to keep buying the actual outside cell and they keep breaking.Do not recommmand this at all."
2,stuck with leftover filters,"I have bought Pur filters repeatedly over the years. The filters have always clogged long before the indicator turns red. Previously, I returned them, as refills were $20 each and had to be replaced weekly. This one had cheaper refills, and they last for three or four weeks before they clog. BY clog, I mean no water comes through at all. I could deal with that and I could deal with the fact that pieces of the outside were falling off, revealing black underneath. I bought this one in February, and now, eight months later it leaks as much unfiltered water as filtered when I filter water, and it drips water when washing dishes. Where do I send it back, along with the unused replacement filters?"
4,KP,Filter provides good tasting water and was easy to install. Much better than other facet mounted filters I have used in the past.
2,Leaky but better than a Brita.,"The good thing about this product is it's convenient in the sense that you don't have to fill up a pitcher and the water quality is good. The annoying part is a) the filters are expensive and you go through them QUICKLY (i.e. about two weeks for my, my wife, and our 3-month old); and b) the damn thing leaks so I am constantly tightening, taking it off and putting it back on, etc. etc. This is super-annoying because it squirts and spurts right on you as you're trying to do the dishes. Major design flaw. We'll live with it because we like the water, but this is not really a very good product at all. Unfortunately it seems like the best thing without going to another class and spending major $$."
4,Pure Water,These are nice filters and easy to install. I have been seeing that the filters are needing frequent replacements. I have not been able to measure how many gallons of water I get from each filter but atleast the quality of water is good.The side piece covering where the filter gets attached to the tap came out however it doesn't affect the filter functioning so I did not bother about it.
2,These Do Not Last Long,"My filter worked great for several months. But shortly after, the connective silver cover that is on the connector part, fell off, and would not reattach. Then, at just about the one year mark, a crack appeared around the indicator and water now sprays out of the crack whenever I turn it on. I will be looking for a new brand of filter to replace this one."
2,"Filters well, but low quality control in recent years","Like a previous reviewer, I had a PUR filter on my sink for 5-6 years without issue. When I accidentally broke it during a move, I simply bought a replacement of the most similar model. Within a year, the ubiquitous hairline cracks appeared, either dripping or spraying water whenever the filter is being used. I don't hold out much hope that my luck will change, so I'm planning to contact P&G to find out when/if this problem will be resolved. I hope to be able to post a 5-star review soon, which is what I would have given the original filter I owned (no longer sold)."
1,I absolutely hate it.,For the entire year that I've owned this thing I've tried to limp it along. After a month it developed a lateral leak from the aerator. After replacing o-rings and buying a new aerator I enjoyed it for some time. However it recently developed a crack in the filter-usage indicator window and now sprays down the kitchen.
1,"Not a 1, but a big fat ZERO",Unfortunately I went and bought the same model after the first one leaked and the chrome (Plastic) piece fell off after only 3 months of use. The second one I bought was even worse and leaks all over the place. It has two pieces of the chrome ( Plastic) housing that have fallen off the unit. Other than that it does great with filtering the water if you don't mind the constant leaking. I have to agree with one of the other comments posted here that turning the unit maybe causing it to fail so early. Just recentIy I bought the upgraded one (just turn the valve not the whole unit) for someone and hope it will last longer than mine did.
1,Leaky Mess,"Sure the box raves about how it filters different types of sediment, but it doesn't tell you how leaky it is. We bought two (one after another) and it leaked from underneath the faucet connector both times. Tightened and retightened, but no improvement. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Didn't even get to taste the water"
1,Just look at the reviews,"Sometimes people just have different experiences with products. They'll get a faulty TV when most other people have no problems. But at the time I write this review this product has a 2 1/2 star rating after 152 reviews. That should tell you enough. You MIGHT get a decent one, but the odds are this product will quickly develop a leak that seems to come from every seam in the product. I was one of the ones who thought it was just the odd one I got, so I tried it again and it developed a leak even quicker (within a couple of months). I'll be looking elsewhere for a faucet water purifier."
1,Filter cracks after a month of use,"Bought this product after using an older version of Pur assuming this would also work fine. I was very happy when it attached to my faucet without any additional hardware. However, after one month of use my wife noticed a small crack behind the filtration unit. We continued to use it running water under low pressure while looking for a better model. Now the crack has widened significantly and we have a mini water fountain flowing in to our living room when unsuspected guests try to get a sip of water. Planning to get a pitcher dispenser to avoid this nonsense."
2,Leaks like a sieve,"I purchased this product a few hours ago and installed following the enclosed instructions.The installation was very easy and took less than 10 minutes. The problem started when I turned on the faucet and a stream of filtered water shot across the counter originating from the filter cover. I tried everything and found that the only way to reduce the spray volume was to replace the filter cover with exactly one revolution (instead of flush and tight). My guess is the manufacturer fails to listen to customer feedback or they just don't care.This would make a great gag gift for a friend. Make sure to come to his house when he installs it, and when he turns on the water have a laugh or two. You may even want to grab a camera to capture the fun."
1,This Filter is Garbage,"The cheap ""Made (designed) in China"" plastic fitting to mount the filter to the faucet doesn't hold the filter correctly. It has broken off the faucet twice since buying it a month ago.If you buy this filter you're wasting $30 of your money because you'll be throwing it away after a few weeks.Maybe the Pur company thinks it's ok for their customers to pay $30 for their garbage. I'll remember well to not buy any of their products in the future."
2,Poor quality,I used the older version of this filter for several years. Of note the faucet fittings were made brass. There was a minor leak but it was tolerable. This new version attaches with plastic fittings. Unfortunately the thread tolerances must be be utterly spurious. The device and the fitting promptly rocketed off my faucet as soon as it was pressurized. I returned it and tried another. Same story. Great taste from this filter but needs work. Switched to the Clear2O system. Caveat emptor.
1,Newly redesigned system broke after 2 months,"This is a review of the newly redesigned system. We bought it a couple of months ago, and the plastic part that attaches the filter to the faucet has threads that have already been stripped by our normal daily use. Now, when we attach the filter to the faucet, it falls off within a few minutes into the sink, because the water pressure (not while filtering but while turned off) exerts too much downward pressure for it to hold. What a terrible waste of money. Why would they make such a vital part out of flimsy plastic? It may be cheaper but it won't last. Buy a system from another company... this one will break. We won't be buying anything made by PUR again."
4,Does what it says.....And I have lab results to prove!,"My Hubby works for the water district here where we live so he took a water sample from our PUR to the lab to see if it really is filtering out all the yuck, and indeed it is. I give it 4 stars because it breaks pretty much every year but the good this is they replace with in a year and it seems that right at 11 months the thing tanks with a crack mostly. I hate that they give plastic fittings instead of metal beacuse they alway wear out with in a couple months and then I have to ask PUR to mail out a new one. we are drinking ""clean"" water and that is all the counts. If PUR put just put a little bit more thought and quality into their product it could be great and they wouldn't be getting so many complaints and/or returns."
1,This thing is a POS,"I have used this filter for a full year now. The filtering capabilities of it is quite good. The water tastes great. The problem is that this is short lived. Each filter is supposed to last 100 gallons, I barely get 30 gallons out of each filter.This particular unit started to spring a leak at the back of it where there is a small hole for air pressure, this started almost exactly as the 1 year warranty expired. Then there was a crack along the plastic between the arm piece and the part that actually holds the filter. This got worse as each day passed. No I am getting water spraying from the filter from that crack and from the top where you screw the filters in place. This pile of junk fell apart in only a years time. I have now had it for 1 year and 3 weeks, it is beyond warranty. Pur refuses to replace the product and I have an extra filter from a 6-pack I bought that is not going to be used. Stay away from this model at all costs. In fact, stay away from Pur if possible."
1,Leaky Water Filter,"I purchased the PUR Advanced Faucet Water Filter in November when I gave up on Brita. For the first few weeks, it worked great. Then it starting leaking when you used it in either the filter or non-filter position. I looked and found that there is a small hole that it leaks from. I assumed the hole is there for a reason, so I contaced PUR to ask if there is a way to repair it. The response I received was that this is an unusual problem and I could return the filter, at my cost, and they would send a new one. I have no intention of wasting money or time on sending this item back, I am sure it will happen again as long as there is a hole in the bottom of the unit. Take my advise and save your money. As soon as this filter is dead, I am trying Culligan."
1,Much more efficient to use water pitcher in fridge.,"I bought this because I had two other roommates and wanted to maximize room in the refrigerator. Filters never lasted longer than one month. They work great for 2-3 weeks of average use and after that you have to replace them because the water flow is so slow, even though we had high pressure city water. I ended up filling water gallons in my free time and putting them in the fridge because it took so long for the water to go through. It would take 15-20 minutes to fill a one gallon jug. In a year we used at least 8 filters and all of them had a 3 week maximum performance, the rest of the time was filling gallons because I didn't want to spend another $20 for a filter after 2 weeks of use.Save yourself the time and buy a regular filter for the fridge, so you do not have to wait for the water flow to your cup. If the pitcher filter style is slow, it doesn't matter because you don't have to wait to fill your cup."
2,Planned obsolescence,The pur click on water filter is made to fail. The washers inside wear outand mine is spraying water all over the place. Very disappointed by themanufacturer. Called the corporate office and they are sending a replacement.The only reason I pursued this is because I have filters that I have not used andthey were expensive.
1,Faulty Mount,"I got this to replace the pitcher filter we've been using, based on recommendations from others. It worked great for about a month, then it started leaking. The easy click on system requires you to screw on a metal/plastic adapter to your faucet. Why it needs to be easy to remove, I don't know. But due to daily repetitive use, the metal sleeve has started to separate from the plastic and water now sprays out the top making it impossible to use without drenching the kitchen. Don't waste your money."
2,Had to remove it after a couple of days,"Despite promises of this being easy-peasy-to install... hmm, notsomuch. None of the adapters really fit my faucet perfectly, though one was really close. Unfortunately, although the water came out of the faucet/filter as it was supposed to--but the filtered water was such a light trickle that it would have driven me insane anyway--having this installed caused backups and leaks. It just wasn't worth the headaches, and other reviews seem to suggest that attempting to get this rectified through customer service would have been a waste of time."
2,good filter...bad everything else,Received this as a gift less than three months ago. The filter part is great. Tne issue is in construction. The snapon mount does not hold the product well and it continually fell off. Do not buy the snapon mounted version.
5,Nice replacement faucet,"I had a different PUR filter faucet for years and I broke it. I replaced it with this one which cost the same and looks pretty similar, however it is a major improvement to the one I have. I love the blinking indicator to tell you how your filter is doing. No more guess work or trying to remember when I put it in. I am sure I put several in too soon, or not soon enough before. This will help save money for sure."
1,I wish I would have listened to the other reviews,Mine only lasted a few monthes-dont buy it I am left with 6 filters -so I guess I have to waste more money-IT DOES SPRING A LEAK! everyone was right!!!
1,Pur faucet mount water purifier,"PUR FM-9400B 3-Stage Horizontal Faucet Mount ChromeI have not been pleased with the Pur vertical mount chrome faucet. However, I am not pleased with the short time that the filter replacement lasts (about 6 weeks), despite the fact that I don't use it very often. I've had a Brita faucet mount in the past and the filter replacement lasted at least 3 months or more. Filters are so expensive that I'll prbably go back to a Brita faucet mount water purifier so I don't have to buy filters as often as I do with the Pur water purifier."
5,Does what it says,I got this to replace my last pur filter. It did not make it though my recent move. The attachments fit and actually fixed my problem with the previous mount. I wish they only sold the attachments. I will use my old one until it breaks and then switch to this unit. I really like the color and it was a good price. I can tell a difference in the water and it beats buying bottled water. I would recommend this product.
1,Broke in less than a month.,"The threads that connect it to the facet stripped in less than month. The plastic seems to be too weak to hold the Pur water filter on. I have had 2 Pur water filters before this. They were older versions and lasted for years. This new version, while looking nicer, didn't hold up."
3,Water tastes clean when you finally fill your cup,"This filter looks good and makes the water taste good. The only problem is that after you use a new filter for a couple of days, the water is processed way to slow."
4,"So far,so good","After reading some of the reviews about this faucet mount, I was concerned with the problem some people were having with leaking. After comparing it to other faucet mounted systems, I was finally convinced to give the PUR FM 3700 3 stage vertical mount a try. I liked the the high marks for filtering and the the number of chemicals that this system filters. When I installed the mount I used teflon tape on the threads on the faucet connection and on the bottom of the mount where the filter goes in. So far, we haven't seen any signs of leaking. We have relatively low water pressure at our house, so that may factor in as well. We've had the mount a few months, and so far we are very satisfied. It seems to do an excellent job filtering water. Our water comes out tasting great and very clear."
3,Pur 3-stage clogs up NYC,"I owned this filter in Seattle and now in Queens. They clog up quickly, expect one month of reasonable flow through and then go on to another cartridge. It beats buying bottled water. Disappointing that PUR cannot design a prefilter for sediment - hey are you guys paying attention yet?"
4,Just what I wanted.,My product came in a few days after purchase and was exactly what was described.
3,Cheap and not in a good way,"Developed a leak in the clear plastic of the meter after only a few months.Its built in such a way that its impossible to fixshort of slathering silicon all over the meter.Otherwise, it does what is advertised, it dispenses great tasting water."
2,Probably Our Last Attempt With These Pur Filters,"This is about our 5th unit (various models, over the last 6 years). It works as far as filtering water, but leaks like every Pur product we've ever had. One month in, the leaks are tolerable, but history tells me it will get worse until the product can't be used. When the valve is turned to un-filtered water, a steady small stream leaks from the filter area. Not intolerable, but annoying. The second leak point occurs where the unit fixes onto the faucet. I have to constantly detach and reattached the unit (which is easy to do, fortunately) to get it to stop. It just seems like a cheap gasket. The positives: looks decent, water tastes great. The negatives: the leaks, short life span."
1,Horrible design,"I owned a previous Britta on-faucet filter that lasted longer than they made the filters for it! Was very happy with it. This one was similar, so I tried it. Really, really wish I had saved the 27 bucks. Cheap plastic adapter was the main problem. After about two weeks I started having leaks. Leaks from the threads, leaks from the collar where the unit attaches to the adapter. Why make an adapter out of plastic? It WILL fail, not if but when. When the filter itself is full of water the weight torques on the adapter causing failure. I guess I'll be going the way of many others and buying (a Britta!) carafe.My advice: don't bother with these lower end on-faucet units. They are built to fail and will not last. Buy a high end unit that is made to last. OR just buy a carafe and make do..."
1,Do not buy this filter,"I had an older model PUR water filter which was excellent but I lost it when I moved so I bought this one. Big mistake. As an engineer I was a little suspicious when they said ""one click easy on easy off"". First of all, the old one was already easy on easy off since it screwed on so there was no need to change it. Secondly, if it clicks on there would be no way to tighten it if it leaked, which it probably would. But I loved my old PUR so like a fool I went ahead and bought the new one. Of course it leaked. I tried putting additional washers on it, but the way it is designed there is really no way to stop the leaks. And man, it leaks all over the place, not just at the faucet mount. In addition, the bypass valve is really cheap. I figured it wouldn't last long, but it actually was already defective, with water coming out both holes, in addition to the leaks, no matter how it was set. This thing is a total disaster. I'm sorry, PUR used to be a good company."
1,TRASH TRASH TRASH,$ave your hard erned money. I've had three of these(stupid me); the mount keapt breaking.Read the reviews on this item.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M4HILW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?ie=UTF8&smid;=A3OZZA3JQB8M8Z
1,would not buy this product again!!!!,"after a year of use, the filter holder cracked and exploded apart. water was only set at half pressure and exploded shooting water everywhere. i bought a culligan water filter now for a cheaper price. i would give it a no star rating but i don't have that option"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this model and the taste of the water was a big improvement. However, upon the filter wearing to the end of its lifespan, the filter housing developed a leak in the filter read window on the unit. The unit began squirting water out the side of the window while filling the glass from below the housing unit. I wouldn't buy another like it due to its short lifespan. I didn't even get to use a second filter with it before the leak developed."
2,doesn't last,"Great idea, just not very well made. The first one cracked at the cap, the second one leaked around the faucet where it can't be repaired. Both happened in less than a year. Just doesn't hold up well."
1,Total waste of money,This product is a total waste of money. We bought it on amazon and it worked fine for 2 weeks. Then it started leaking and how! My kitchen was all flooded whenever I used it. I am not going to buy another Pur product for sure.
2,Pur--ly Crackable,"Though a perfect solution for Seniors with arthritic conditions, P&G; should be ashamed for distributing this product. Apparently sending it to Mexico for sub-par plastic mold manufacturing makes it okay to then sell it in the U.S.By the way, they actually make more money on the filters--but you can soak them in Vinegar to clear out the lime build-up and get extended life from it. However, I haven't found a solution that works for resealing the plastic molding.If you don't want this kind of trouble from a product--don't buy it."
1,Hairline crack,"I have the same problem as stated above. After a couple of months of operation, a hairline crack developed at the replacement indicator window. Sadly the construction is not what it should be as my wife and I use the unit very lightly.I've contacted P&G; and hopefully they will cross ship a replacement. If not, I would say avoid this product and others made by this company. I will try to post back when I have heard from P&G; so that others know how this was resolved.Hope this helps!"
2,Cracks and short life span for cartridge,"I've had this faucet mount for close to a year. While the water does taste good, the short cartridge life and the eventual cracks that the housing develops after a while makes this a useless product. The cartridges almost always clogged up so badly to a trickle even before the indicator went to 3/4 full. This mean more frequent costly replacements. Now that the housing has developed cracks and water spits out from 3 different places, we can't even turn it on anymore. Considering the many reviews with the same problems, it's obvious it's inherent in the product and there's no reason to buy another. Now on to another solution!"
1,Sucks,"Continually falls off faucet due to turning the water on, treads on adapter stripped after 12 hours. After reading reviews and finding out that this is a problem every one has it is going back to the store."
1,Ash,"We owned a PUR before this that screwed on to the faucet. It lasted about a year before it broke which was fine because we got our moneys worth of water. However, this new ""one click installation"" is ridiculous. The filter stayed on for a week then it flew off the faucet one day and the threads that kept it on were destroyed. I am extremely disappointed because the mineral filter water was actually really good. This product is cheaply made of thin plastic. I believe all the PURs are now made with ""one click installation"" so we don't plan to buy another faucet filter. As far as the water it tasted great and I'd give the filter 5 stars for that, but the filter alone is 1 star."
1,Avoid this,This product leaked from the minute I installed it. There's a reason it gets so many bad reviews. Avoid this product. Check out the Target reviews - 19 of 35 reviewers gave it one star. I don't understand why Pur is making this product.
1,The plastic adaptor is trouble maker !,"This is the third PUR I bought. The new one-click design is cool. But it only works well for two months and is keep falling off. The trouble is from the plastic adaptor. After one more moth, it can not hold the whole device any more. I won't recommend this product to you."
1,"""up to""","Up to 2-3 months or 100 gal. It cloged at the one month mark, and I fill only 8 gallons. Unfortunate one month is all they guarantee the filter for. Wow."
1,Terrible product,"This product worked relatively fine for a week, then it never stayed on again. I've tried hundreds of times over the last year I've had it to reattach it to the faucet and it either falls off as soon as I try to filter water or it sprays everywhere. Arguably one of the worst water filters on the market. Like I have read elsewhere it's like just taking $40 and throw it out the window."
4,Day 1 - updates to follow,"Just received the filter, and kind of like it so far. Was easy to mount on my faucet (and, as the description promises, you can pivot it on the faucet so that the filter is not in the way. You can also easily take it off the faucet with just one push of a button. It is plastic, of course... which is why I didn't want to buy it - but there are no alternatives made of anything durable...I have to say that the filter made an amazing difference to the taste of my water. I just moved from a place with some great-tasting tap water to a community where water tastes and smells like... a lake from where it originates. Kind of like algae? not what I like! -- Today, when I finally used the filter, it made all the difference in the taste and smell of water - it is tasty, refreshing... now I look forward to drinking it. And, of course, tea brewed with this ""new"" water is massively more tasty, as well!However, I do trust all the negative reviews ahead of mine. I will be posting updates."
2,Disappointed,"I have been using PUR faucet mount filters for many years, but that is coming to an end. There is a design flaw in the newest version of this thing and it is very disappointing because the filtered water is great. The last three units I used cracked near the top of the cartridge holder. When that happens, there is an explosion of water that sprays everywhere, and your filter is ruined. My most recent unit ruptured before I had even finished my second filter cartridge. In the old days, these units lasted for years and numerous filter cartridges.So I am going to try an under-the-sink system. Anybody need an extra PUR filter cartridge?"
3,is it only me? hmm....,excited about getting iti got it in a couple of daysimmediately installed itdid the instructionsleft it on for 5mins on filter before using itthen tragedy struckthe adapter helpedbut the problem is the water is spilling & spraying out from the bottom of the adapter upwards like its not meant to hold so much pressure? then i tried only a small amount of pressure and it still spills alittle from the sidesif i turn on my faucet to the fullest pressure the device falls off i tried seeing if the other adapters would work but none fit since mine is an outward onthen i tried pushing the device tighter/closer to the faucet and that did reduce the spilling and spraying but since i cant push it anymore in it still spillings alittle and i read i can return unopen productsso now im stuck with this device
2,"unit leaky, breaky, and water still tastes funky","I've bought two of these 3 stage PUR filter faucet units in the past three years; they either cracked or started to leak in under a year with normal light use from only one person. I had the last one replaced under warranty from PUR. They sent the latest design with the quick connect feature which works well to snap on and off the faucet easily and I must say it's really nice to be able to remove the unit so quickly. The problem is that the water still tastes ""funky""; I do have hard water and maybe that is part of the problem. I still use this filter for cooking but not for producing drinking water.Still looking for a reliable, relatively inexpensive (less than 80 cents a gallon) way to produce clean fresh tasting water at home; please leave a comment or suggestion if you've had success with this."
2,Good but pay attention to the filter!!!!,"The product is good, I don't really know if there is any different between the water filtered and not, BUT YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION AT THE FILTER, IT SUPPOSE TO WORK FOR 100 GALLON, BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SELL MORE FILTERS POSSIBLE, THE GREEN LIGHT CHANGE FOR RED AFTER 1 MONTH AND HALF EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T USE!!!!!!THATS ABSURD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Poor, Cheap Design - Pur Faucet Filter - 3400B","This is the worst design I've ever seen for a faucet water filter. My previous Pur filter got a crack in the side after just a few months of use. Since I still have unused Pur filters, I bought this one hoping it would be better. Looks like it's going to have the same problem - instead of channeling the water from the faucet into the filter, the water fills up the cheap plastic housing that holds the filter and it makes its way into the filter through pressure. I'm returning it and probably switching to another brand even though I've got the extra Pur filters.I almost forgot - the ""one click"" feature also doesn't work very well eitherl. It's a flimsy plastic button/grip onto a rubberish piece that screws onto your faucet. Too much water pressure and it ""one-clicks"" right off! I just got my new Brita filter - MUCH better."
3,Nice Looking unit,"Though I have always used a Pur Water Filtering System for 8 years, no matter how many faucet connections are given with this unit, some don't work. It is not an easy replacement for the generation prior to it."
2,SHORT TIME,This filter says it lasts up to 100 Gallons (2-3 months). It lasts only 2 1/2 weeks. The water just drips out. I don't think I drank a 100 gallons of water in that time period.
2,Wrong Model Pictured,"The photo for this item is wrong (May 2010). It shows the old swiveling model, which is far sturdier than the current ""space saving"" model. The new model, as you can see from the other reviews, is not rated very highly. Thinking I would get the old solid one pictured, I ordered. Unfortunately, I received the flimsy new one. I should have checked the part numbers--Amazon gives the correct part number for the new model, but pictures the old model. Confusing. I considered returning it, but too much hassle, plus I'd have to pay postage. So I went ahead and installed the new model. Hopefully it will last until I've used up my stock of Pur filters, but I'm not optimistic. This new one wiggles on the faucet, and tends to drip out of the filter side. The plastic lever which switches it from unfiltered flow to filtered flow does not feel as if it will hold up for long. Time will tell."
3,PUR 3-Stage Water Mount Filters,"Unfortunately, the filters DO NOT last as long as PUR states. It is suppose to last approximately 3 months or about 100 gallons. I am the only person using this product and only use it for drinking water and making a pot of coffee. The unit does not last as long as the manufacturer states. They need to re-think their advertising."
2,"Great Tasting Water, But Needs to be Replaced Every 6mo","I'm not really adding much to the conversation here: they break. They start leaking at about 6 months and the only thing you can do is buy a new one. BUT! I think I just tracked down their phone number (which is not listed on their website). Maybe if people keep calling and complaining they'll do something about it. The office is closed as I type this, but I intend to try tomorrow during business hours. 800-787-5463"
2,Poor Construction,"I've been through 2 since July. The first one started developing hairline cracks after a few months, and the one I have now is starting to crack as well. The cracks are smaller this time, and I managed to patch them up with crazy glue. We'll see how long it lasts. Once this one goes I'll never buy a Pur filter again."
2,"Good for a while, then starts leaking","I've owned a few different PUR filter enclosures now, and just like all the others this one lasted through about 4 cartridges before it started leaking, this time from around the window/meter area.What's the point in having filtered water if it's mixing with unfiltered water as it's coming out? I'm tired of throwing PUR enclosures in the trash. I'll buy one more to get through my remaining filters and then I'm changing to another brand."
1,Save yourself from getting drenched,"I've used these types of PUR filters for a long time, until now. Having invested in a multi-pak of filter inserts, I've opted to replace the housing several times. Within the last 18 months, we've gone through four. Here's how it unfolds: the chrome-plated versions - the bottom chrome piece falls off in a month or so, then the upper portion squirts water from the side of the replacement indicator. The white unit develops a crack in the upper housing just above the PUR insignia. In both cases, you and your surroundings will get wet. PUR (Procter & Gamble) will not respond to complaints for warranty or otherwise. The filtered water will taste good, but you'll need to wear a raincoat."
2,Disappointed,"Within weeks of getting the filter, the plastic adapter threads began to wear out and it kept falling of the faucet as mentioned in many of the other review. Very disappointed considering our older unit never did this and I wouldn't have had to buy this one if the glue holding it together hadn't come apart. What's the point of a faucet filtration system if it can't stay on the faucet. I called P&G to complain a few days ago and I'm supposed to receive new adapters, but they will probably be plastic as well and won't solve the issue."
1,Piece of CRAP!,"This thing is such a hunk of junk! Within 3 weeks of installing, it kept falling off everytime I'd try to get filtered water and water would squirt all over my kitchen. I called the PUR hotline and they told me I needed new adaptors with the threading and that it would take up to 3 weeks to receive them. I called at 2 weeks to check on it and I was told it was on it's way and to give it the full 3 weeks. I called again at 3 weeks and was told, ""oops, we never sent it to you"". Honestly, the design is so crappy that I doubt the new part will even make a difference. Obviously, their customer service is less than stellar and miscommunication at their company is rampant. I WILL NEVER BUY A PUR PRODUCT AGAIN. They have lost a customer for life and from the looks of these reviews, I'm not the only customer they've lost. P&G should be ashamed of themselves for selling this junk!"
4,Improves water quality,"First of all, I typically drink bottled filtered water and even buy it for our coffee/tea, etc. I despise foul tasting drinking water that smells/tastes more like it was dipped out of a swimming pool than for drinking.This dramatically improves the water quality and makes it acceptable for drinking and coffee. I can't say aye or nay on the life of the filter--we haven't used it long enough."
1,Very disappointed,"The good news is that the device fit my faucet perfectly. The bad news centers on the quantity of water provided by each filter. My first filter lasted about half as long as I expected considering my average water usage per month and the company's claim of 100 gallons per filter. I decided to measure the water provided by my second filter. I got 57 gallons of filtered water. I realize that the company's claim is an ""estimate,"" but to miss the mark by that much is more than a simple mistake on their part. I don't recommend this product."
2,Hard to install compared to old PUR filter designs,"I purchased a PUR FM-3700B faucet filter to replace my old PUR filter that snapped in two. Unlike the old PUR, which was easily attached to my faucet, the new One-Click would not install. Four adapters are provided, 2 each for outside and inside threaded faucets. The ""A"" adapter almost fits, but not quite. The ""B"" one isn't even close. ""C"" and ""D"" are for an entirely different type of faucet.The instructions say to call customer support if the adapters do not work. That deposits one into phone tree purgatory and a voice mail system that is incompatible with my Android phone. Maybe it was the tone they use between data ""fields""? I do not have a land line to try customer support again.So the filter doesn't fit. The adapters don't adapt. The customer support system doesn't support.I shall try to cobble together something using parts from a hardware store.I am unimpressed by this version of ""progress""."
2,One click -- after you manage to get your aerator off,"I was excited to get this in the mail -- but it's still sitting on the counter, after I've spent an hour trying to get the aerator off my (very new) kitchen faucet. I've tried using rubber mats for leverage, pliers, elbow grease -- it won't budge. I'm sure the filter is an easy one-click installation, IF you happen not to have an aerator or you have a singularly easy one to remove. I'm afraid I'm going to end up having to return this PUR mount and filter, as it's not worth hiring a plumber for something like this."
1,Worst people to deal with!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,"These people will take your money, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! NO customer service, sent me a broken product, would not refund it or respond! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!"
2,Does not fit on all faucets,"This doesn't fit on my faucet, regardless of the extra parts it comes with. I had to give up after the 3rd trip to the hardware store to get something to make it work right. I gave the setup/filter to a family member since I already opened it, but am going with an RO water system instead."
1,We are very disappointed.,"Bought it, installed it, we get very little water out of it. The trickle would take two or three minutes to fill a glass of water. Basically, useless."
5,Double Dribble,"Another Konami classic. The graphics/effects are very basic but that's part of what is so great about this game! Anyone can play, and it keeps the playing field fair bc there is very little learning curve for more or less experienced players."
3,Good TV but has it's problems.,"I've had this TV for 2.5 years and it has held up well.It does have a problem with the EPROM getting corrupt. This will happen probably after year 2. You will get 2""-4"" red, blue or green spots on the TV that shows up with certain lighting. The spots are static in that it stays at the same area.Hats off to Panasonic. They did own up to the problem and repaired it out of warranty. The fix was fairly quick....15 minute process to upgrade (reprogram) the EPROM."
5,BIG Great TV for the good price,"bright & crisp picture quality, greate design, good quality sound, good contrast ratio, 3lcd technology gives true colors, easy to select inputs, 4 comonent, 4 composite, 1 hdmi gives more flexibility to have more devices. sd photo card reader is excellent, pc input gives more flexibility to connet your computer. hdtv inbuild tuner, cablecard ready what not, it has everythin you need with great price, this product canbe compared with the most expensive tv's, this tv can sit any place in your home, you can watch the tv in any lighting conditions. i am really liking this tv since last one week, i recommend this tv. only thing i did not like is Stand, it is simply $599."
1,Not a smart buy,"Problems with this television from the beginning. The lamp was not the issue. The picture created yellow, green, red, and blue spots within one to two years. Within three years the lamp finally went out and by four years the television was gone. Don't buy this tv."
5,A must for beginners and intermediate CF users alike,"Before I bought this book I had never heard of Cold Fusion (Except the Nuclear stuff in school). After using this book I had a database driven web site up in a week. If you are new to CF and do not have version 4.0, BUY IT! lots of great examples."
5,Still use this as a constant reference,"I have had this book for about a year and a half and I still find myself returning to it again and again (Probably because my memory isn't what it used to be). Introduces web designers to database creation for dynamic web page generation. Great examples that show how easy it is to create web to database integration. Shows uses of javascript with Cold Fusion. If you can't wait for Cold Fusion 4.0 to come out, get this one!"
4,Great Book for Beginners,"This is an amazing book for beginners who want to better understand how Cold Fusion works. However it appears to be a complete reference of Cold Fusion, which it isn't. After finshing this book I was left with a lot of great new ideas yet my questions went unanswered.The indexing definately needs to be handled better, I spent most of my time searching chapters to reference a specific example"
2,Not Available,I attempted to purchase this item. I received the message below from the vendor.I am so sorry but we had to remove this item fromAmazon as we can't sell it there at this time asit is a Hazardous Material Item...We uploaded a large number of items at once & thisone got by us by accident. It wasn't suppose to havebeen uploaded at this time...
4,"Smart, wonderfully acted, wistful, fun homage to the great detective films","I really like this sweet semi-comic homage to the great detectivefilms. Art Carney is simply wonderful as a gumshoe now in his 60s,gaining weight and losing foot-speed, but with wits as sharp as ever,and wisdom gained by time. This is what one of Bogie's great detectivecharacters probably would be like 30 years later.He's drawn into an absurdly complex crime situation, when a slightlywacko aging hippie wanna-be actress (played by Lily Tomlin) hires himto help find her lost cat. 'Some of the humor is a bit broad for the more serious themesunderneath, and as much as I always love Tomlin, there were times sheseemed to be flirting with caricature.But the almost-romantic chemistry between this supremely miss-matchedpair is terrific and fun to watch. It doesn't add up to anything huge,but it's intelligent, fun well-executed entertainment for grown ups -something that's far too rare in the current cinema."
2,A failed film noir,"I purchased this film because of the rave reviews, on Amazon and elsewhere, and because of the two highly talented stars. What a jolt to discover that the film is a flop, a failed attempt to remake a film noir featuring someone like Humphrey Bogart or Peter Falk as the tough detective. Toss in an airhead junkie as the sidekick and you have magic, right? Wrong. The script is the primary problem. It's unintelligible and without an ounce of wit. There is the grisly murder and the car chase for the teenagers. And the sloppy ending, so that everyone will go home satisfied. But it all adds up to nothing. I'd rather watch re-runs of ""Law and Order."""
4,A forgotten gem,"I can't believe no one else has reviewed this fine movie. Art Carney has never been better, even in Harry and Tonto, and Bill Macy does a fine turn as a small-time con man. Lily has some classic lines, like her description of Macy's trash Cadillac; ``This car is a toilet and you're the attendant''.Partly a send up of private detective movies and partly a charming buddy movie (Art and Lily), this belongs in anyone's collection. And if you've never seen it . . . well, you're in for a treat indeed."
1,True Point and Shoot - LCD useless,"I am an avid snorkler and over the years I have used a variety of 35 mm point and shoot underwater cameras -- Canon and Minolta's Weathermatics. So I was excited to see what digital could do for underwater shots. Good news and BAD news.The quality of the shots is excellent; look at the shot, looks horrible, put it in photoshop, Auto-Levels and BANG! Great color.However, the big problem is the A-80's LCD . The housing covers the viewfinder, and there is no ""sport-finder"" (external finder). The LCD is totally unviewable in bright sun, which is necessary for decent underwater shots. A true Point and Pray. Really disappointing. Shooting moving targets is hard enough without even being able to put them in a viewfinder."
4,Great product for underwater photography,"We took our new waterproof case on a trip to Mexico, where it got great use when we snorkled or just relaxed on the beach. Very easy to use, and put our minds at ease regarding getting sand in our Powershot."
4,Fun story for kids and adults alike.,"This book is a fun, Victorian sort of superhero tale. It's not a long book at all, but that seems like it would be perfect for young readers. I like that some parts of the dialogue are done in comic form, and that there are little funny illustrations on a lot of the pages. I thought that was a great idea, and well-executed. The story is simple, three orphans trying to escape from their dodgy wardens and get on a ship to America. I like that you never find out very much about Spring-Heeled Jack, even at the end of the book, which means that the character still has a lot of mystery to him. I feel like this character could easily become part of a series, and I hope that Pullman will consider writing more adventures for Spring-Heeled Jack."
5,A blend of graphic novel elements with paragraphs of text,Spring-Heeled Jack is a British superhero who was legendary long before today's popular comics: here his adventures and mishaps come alive with stories by Pullman and comic-strip illustrations by David Mostyn. The blend of graphic novel elements with paragraphs of text will encourage elementary-level readers in grades 4-6.
2,"eh, it was ok","The book was interesting only because of the interesting way that Pullman combines cartoon strips and story plot into one work. The plot wasnt all that great. The story is about three orphans who escape from an orphanage, and get kidnapped by an evildoer in london. Spring heeled jack is the hero, except he is also grotesque according to pullman's description of him as a ""devil"" and ppl fear him. It does have a typical happy ending though. I recommend pullman's other novels if you are looking for a good plot and interesting characters! :)"
3,Metaphor in American Sign Language,"Metaphor in American Sign Language, by Phyllis Perrin Wilcox, while extrememly informative, is a very difficult read. I sometimes had to re-read a sentence, paragraph, or entire page several times to understand what it was actually talking about. It seems there would be much simpler ways in conveying the concepts addressed in this book. Otherwise, it is full of information, and is reccommended to anyone looking for a challenging read in the field of American Sign Language and Deaf Studies."
3,"Good introductory book, but not comprehensive as indicated","I live in a tropical country and wanted to know about growing orchids commercially. I bought the book expecting to get a thorough understanding of the ""basics"" of orchid cultivation. The book was NOT expected to make me a knowledgeable grower.Considering my prior knowledge was low (I had an extremely basic knowledge of Dendrobiums), I learned a few things about growing orchids. In general, the book gives a very basic knowledge of orchids and their cultivation. I felt depth of coverage was far too weak for someone interested in commercial cultivation, or the orchid enthusiast. If that was the purpose of the book, then I would rate it a single star. On the other hand, if you were just growing a few orchids in your house and wanted to learn a bit more about the species, this book would serve your purpose admirably. For that purpose, it should be rated 4-5 stars. Therefore, I gave it 3 stars."
3,Good info but not a pleasant read,"This book contains lots of valuable information, but it's long and not very well written. To be honest it's rather boring but I still ploughed through the whole thing to get all the information. The worst for me were the long lists of numbers given within paragraphs, and the fact that information is often repeated several times."
4,Fun from Tragedy,"A doco of British twins making music, sex and near ""normal living"" is much easy to watch for its more entertaining thanTwin Falls Idahofrom the start tragic scences fueled with buzz, lust and sex.However funny, the story final is anyway dramatic, questioning very reasons for giving birth to medically-inseparable conjasted fetuses."
5,Best Film of 2006,A clever work of rock and roll art that really defies description. Takes the movie-within-a-movie motif to places its never gone before.
4,Good taste of Latin American lit,"This book is really helpful for getting a review of prominent Latin American writers. The only thing that would make this book better, would be more extensive biographies of the writers."
2,Lost in the translation,"This book is an eclectic collection of surrealistic short stories. Many of the stories have an odd, nightmare-like quality to them. The language does not flow like in most short stories, and this may be a problem intrinsic in reading a story that has been translated. It takes considerable effort to get through these stories."
5,Love it!!,"I wanted a workout and also wanted to learn how to belly dance. Azar is definitely the answer! Easy to follow, not too repetitious, but enough to learn the move and move on without getting bored. I would recommend this to anyone who has never tried bellydancing and wants to learn the basic moves easily. The music is great and there are links to suppliers! I'm checking out Azar to see what else she has to offer!"
1,Performance continued to degrade,"The difference between Dec 2006 when I signed up and now is striking. I used to get very fast performance, but over the past year it has steadily decreased. Seems verizon has done little to nothing to maintain, expand their infrastructure, at least IMHO."
2,Pretty Sad,"One would think Black & Decker could put out a quality light for twenty bucks, but these handcrank things are still sadly behind the times. Will you get 15 minutes of light for one minute of cranking? Yes, but the light will be so dim after five minutes it won't be good for much except for looking directly into the light. You'd be just as well off buying a Chinese no-name, which is what this is with the B&D name."
1,Quality would be shoddy even for a Chinese no-name,"I agree with the poster who described this product as a Chinese no-name - and I can't understand why a company would put their name on something so flimsy. A lot of cranking for not much light that in seconds fades to nothing. I've only cranked it a couple of times, but I'm pretty sure the flashlight would be broken at around 6 uses. Total waste."
2,Black & Decker Handcrank Flashlight,"We were not very impressed with these. You have to crank forever to get some light, and the light was not very bright."
2,"Introducing a new idea, but not new action","Join Billy and Jimmy in a similtaneous brawling on the streets game. This is the same game as ever, just with less graphics. They tried to incorporate a new idea to this game by having Billy and Jimmy on a quest around the world to find Billy's girlfriend Maria. The game gets very old quickly because of how long it is and the lack of enemy variety."
1,Worst game ever...,A friend gave me money to order this for him. I personally didn't like this game. It's the worst in the Double Dragon series.
4,cool martial arts,graphics could be better but you get to be different characters after you beat the 2 bosses out of the 5 different levels and then you can be them and the boss comes included with his own weapon that u can use for limited time .... u get to be a ninja and a kung fu guy and if you're playig with a friend on two player you can decide which one of u which get which well after billy and the other dude with red hair are dead ...as far as the fighting goes i see some reviews that say the fighting from the other two is better but its hard to say this game has its own unique style of fighting double dragon 2 has better graphics this game is just more damn fun to play if you are playing it by urself unlike double dragon 1 and 2
4,Nice Kids Movie,This movie really got the attention of our 5 and 6 year old grasndkids. Our 11 year old son was ok with this. Worth the money we spent on it.
1,The Flight Before Christmas,"The story line it terrible for children! Santa's reindeer having one night stands??? How is this appropriate?Then, when the son makes it to meet his father, none of the reindeer recognise the mom's name. Once the boy proves he can fly then the dad comes forward.So, Santa's reindeer are a bunch of ""dawgs"" who only will bother to aknowledge their own kids as long as they have extraordinary abilities.The mother didn't bother to get the reindeers name before she made a baby with him, what is she a groupie?This movie is more reminiscent of Knocked Up than anything else.The wolves were very scarry for my 4 and 6 year old.NOT a Christmas feel good movie at all."
1,don't waste your money,"I purchased this for my young grandchildren and am I glad that I watched it first before letting them see it.I feel this is totally wrong for young childern ( and isn't that who christmas cartoons are geared towards?) It starts out with a mother explaining basically a one night stand with one of santas reindeer when asked about her sons father and the wolves are way too frightening for young children. However, the animation is good and they did have some catchy songs. I was going to give the dvd away but now will just throw it in the trash. Don't want to scare any other childeren!"
2,Could have been a great animated film!,"We actually own this DVD. I would give it 5-stars if it didn't have such a poor moral message. Although caribou may not mate for life in real life, for a children's film, to discuss how this little reindeers father came into town one night, never to be seen again and this little reindeer was born in the spring was so blatantly obvious a message of a one night stand that didn't need to be. They could have written it so differently. I really liked the film except for this pathetic part. So for that reason, I would say - Don't buy it! Adults only!"
1,Incredibly inappropriate,"Like has otherwise been said by other reviewers; the primary plotline in this production is a young reindeer tracking down his deadbeat dad who knocked up his mother. The father when found tries to remain incognito about his fatherhood, then begrudgingly admits it but takes at pass at the idea of getting back together with the mother/being a father to his biological son."
4,New Family Christmas Story,"This is a animated Christmas movie featuring a cute baby reindeer named Niko (Andrew McMahon).He has several animal friends that help him search for his roots (his father is Prancer, one of Santa's Sleigh Crew). It is also a story of belief in yourself and trying new things. It was produced in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.S.Niko, has been told that his father could fly. He goes out in search of his father, along with Julius the Flying Squirrel (Norm MacDonald) and Wilma, a cute small white rodent-like animal (Emma Roberts). Niko suffers from severe dizziness and is also young and vulnerable as the story unfolds. He has many challenges in finding his father including a pack of bad wolfs who want to eat Santa, all his reindeer and the boys and girls presents are delivered to.The story is original and fun to watch as Niko finds his father, and his true friends through it all.The animation and voices are terrific and fun to watch a new story on the Christmas Season."
1,"Dreadful premise, plot, characters, actors.","This was awful. One night stands, missing fathers, wolves after the reindeer, the best of the ""Flight Force"" scared to stand up to normal life, all of the adults blaming the kid.Awful.The plot, if there was one, was hard to follow.Norm MacDonald as the star? That is a perfect match with this abysmal production.I was sorry to see it on TV. I would never recommend anyone buying or renting this drivel."
4,Great!,The kids love it as much as I do. Great animation and cute story.This one will be watched many times!
4,Very good movie,"This movie was very good. Good animation. Lots of fun & adventure. And a slightly different approach to a holiday movie. Some reviewers are complaining this movie is too scary for little ones. I don't think it is. It's on par (intensity wise) with a ""Finding Nemo"". I'm not comparing the movie's quality to Nemo. I'm just saying if you found Nemo to be acceptable for your children, then you'd have no problem with this movie (imo). My 2 1/2 year old girl loves ""The Flight Before Christmas"". She asks for it almost every day. I won't get into story lines or plot elements. I simply say the movie is a lot of fun. Much more action filled than a typical Christmas movie. And something different than your typical ""Santa and his flying reindeer"" type of movie. Our whole family enjoyed it."
1,Junk,"The book is a very bad copy written on poor quality paper and the pages are falling out. My suggestion is, if it is not from sunset books do not buy it."
5,So cute,"We love this book- we bought it for my 1 yr old and she really enjoys feeling all of the tactile parts on the pages. Plus, the adorable Pooh friends are brightly colored and fun."
3,Description,"She never got over her crush on GrantLiz had become a successful author, Grant a famous surgeon, in the years since she had worshipped him and he had called her ""the horror.""Now, his career ruined by an accident, deserted by his fiancee, Liz's handsome former neighbor was returning home.Passion grew as Liz helped Grant recover his zest for life. And when he proposed, even though he told her she'd never have his love, Liz accepted...."
1,Thirty One Chapters too many!,"After experiencing the first 18 chapters first hand, I feel compelled to warn other potential readers about this book. I also found this book to be wordy, cryptic and boring. The fact that the preface is nine pages long should give you a clue of what your in for. Apparently the authors felt compelled to share and prove their knowledge with the rest of us. The unfortunate thing is, they did ! There are many classic Thermo. books that are well written with good supporting examples and this book is not one of them. Out of print is where it should be."
5,made well,i bought this shirt for my husband and i was thought it would be a cheap made shirt i was very surprized to see how well made it was i have also washed it like 6 times and it hasn't sunk or faded i am really happy with this product and would recommend it to any one
1,Handybar fairly useless,"Handybar cannot be kept in place, so it is not very convenient to use. Haven't figured out a place to keep it in the car where it can be easily reached, so do not use it. A waste of moeny"
3,Better DVDs are available on this topic,"I found the narrator of these ""trips"" to be a bit long-winded and somewhat full of himself. He tends to ramble and mumble as he ""travels"" to each place. He is also British so some of the humor did not ""translate"" well to my students. I teach elementary gifted students and we are studying World Wonders as our topic. I bought this DVD along with other resources. The Reader's Digest ""Great Wonders fo the World"" was better because it was more on topic and more understandable and consise for historical facts."
3,"Scenic but,","The travel was very scenic and interesting, but if I was on a trip with this guy he and I would of gotten in several fights along the trip. The host probably will eventually rub most the wrong way. If I were on vacation with him I would of dumped him in China and went off on my own."
2,Is it just me?,I don't know if anyone else experiences this but I get really dizzy playing this game. There's something about the visual effects/ coloring/ textures/ rendering/ etc. that makes me feel dizzy. Don't know what's wrong as I still have 20/20 vision. This game is not playable for me eventhough it may be promising. Shellshock is simpler and more playable (no squad commands though).
5,Very Fun Multiplayer Game,"This is the most fun military game i have played. Alot of people are saying that this game sucks because of graphics. Well the graphics are just fine. the only problem with them is when zoomed in with the sniper the guys are sometimes not right. But who cares this game is fun. It include real battles like the Tet offensive whic i thought to be on of the most fun levels. I also like the fact that they did not make it to realistic like full spectrum warrior. It is real enough and fun. On easy the game is very simple and you can beat it within 4 hours but as you move through the difficulties it gets much harder. the best part of this game is that you earn points for doing well and at the end of each mision you can increase your players skill levels on things like machin gun, pistol, sniper, grenades and other things. All in all this will be the best 40 bucks yo will spend."
3,Slow & Sluggish,"Controls are a mess!You have to do about 5 different things just to fire a weapon!Too many things to remember,I want to have fun playing a game,not spend 2 years in college to learn the controls!tip for game developers:simplify my brother!"
4,A whole heap of fun!,"I eagerly awaited the release of Conflict: Vietnam after spending way too long playing both Desert Storm games and, even better in my opinion, The Great Escape, all made by Gotham Games. C:V did not dissapoint.Whilst I don't think it's a great deal different from C:DS2, there are still some neat new touches. At last we can pick up other weapons, fight an (semi) intelligent enemy and, best of all, issue commands.The 14 different levels were a distinct mixed bag; Charlies Point was almost pathetically simple whereas Tunnel Rats took me weeks to get past. My only other slight complaints would be the odd glitch, such as when one of your guys gets stuck somewhere for no reason and the unecessary swearing that is cliched and gets old after a while. Otherwise, well done Gotham Games!!"
1,what a pain!,could not get out of ghost town ! nothing worked.at least with desert storm you dont HAVE to play it! but you can because its fun and it works.
5,why the price?,"Do not be fooled by the low price into thinking that this recording is of low quality. The recording is actually rather well done and the digital clarity is superb. The reason for the low price is that there is an error on the back side of the CD case - the sonatas have been displayed out of order. If you're not picky about that, definitely purchase this bargain and take advantage of the blunder."
4,Fun,Having Collected Pez for over 5 or so years I saw this on Amazon an needed it right away. When it got here it worked perfectly and just as they said it would. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,didnt work,I also tried this on three different computers and two of the three didnt recognize that I had a disk in the drive. I returned it after hours of fooling around to get it to work. dont buy it!
1,It doesnt work. AT ALL,"I tried to install this on 3 different computers and none of them could read the CD. I bought this product twice. Thinking the first one was defective,But the second one did the same thing. Dont buy this."
3,This is one of my wife's favorite games ever.,The game is entertaining a couple of times through. On the harder levels the questions are pretty tough.It's tough to play an 8-bit NES game today with no nostalgia associated with it (2012 was the first time I played this game).
1,again sent wrong product,"again herban gardens sent the wrong product, sent black cohost lose in a plastic bag, not the capsules I ordered, was I to buy gelatin capsules and fill then myself"
4,Very good,Now this is another good cd from MAXIPLAY i have here.It is allnot bad but it is worth hearing.Also there are many short works here.4 STARS OF COURSE.
1,Titles are all wrong,"A number of the tracks are incorrectly titled. For instance. The Track titled Hey Mom Look at Me plays I Can Run to Georgia. The Track named Hey You...How You Feel plays Airborne, the track titled Airborne plays I Feel Alright Now. And so on. Very disappointing. Even does it on the previews."
1,Doesn't look this good,"There's probably a reason these wings are hard to find on the web -- they suck and probably were discontinued.From the image, you'd think they are well-sculpted and thick -- but in reality, they're just a piece of thick rubber that looks like it was cut out with a box knife. The ""wiring"" they talk about to hold it up is only along the top. It would have made more sense to put the wire along the bone-structure of the wings, as this would make them more adjustable.The biggest beef is that they have no thickness to them -- the areas that look like they're thicker (the spines and bone-structure) are actually just painted. It's about the same thickness all the way through. Mine were not painted very well and didn't really look the part.I would suspect this would be an acceptable costume prop for MAYBE $20 -- but definitely no higher.This is a very disappointing product."
5,The best Vietnam game ever,"Conflict: Vietnam is a really good game. It is better than Conflict: Desert Storm 1 and 2. It is hard but it is still posible to beat it. I did because I got the stategy guide which helps a lot. The grafics are really good and the controls are the same. Now in Conflict: Vietnam you can tell you squad members to heal people, Shield people or pick up something. The AI is a lot better. Sometimes the enemy will play dead or plan a ambush. Theres even boobytraps like tripwires, pungi sticks and pits with spikes in it. The best part is the vehicles. You can ride in jeeps, tanks, river boats, helicopters and a armored thing with a lot of guns on it. You cant steer the riverboat or helicopter but you can shoot the guns on them. It has some real battles that you can fight in like Hue and Tet Offensive. Conflict: Vietnam is in 3rd person and you can look down the guns sight if you want to aim carefully. If you liked Conlict: Desert Storm you should definatly get this."
1,Conflict Vietnam,This will not play and I am stuck with this game. My son has not yet got to play the game.
2,See the Stage Play,"It's a moving stage play but a disappointing movie. Jack Lemmon gives a one-note performance, playing the same aggrevated character he did in ""The Out-of-Towners."" Anne Bancroft, however, is flawless as his wife. The script is dark comedy, but Lemmon left out most of the comedy and left us with just his angst. Sloppy, hurried direction would be my guess."
2,A movie that hasn't worn well,"Forty years ago, the notion of being unemployed was considered legitimate material for a comedy (and not a black comedy, either), and since Neil Simon was America's leading comedic playwright, he wrote this story of a Manhattan executive down on his luck and high on his phobias.To be honest, these days the subject matter doesn't seem very funny at all, but this movie has some good performances, especially by Anne Bancroft as the long-suffering wife. In some ways, the movie is a like a long commercial for gun control--if you were married to this guy, you'd want to shoot him...or yourself.Sylvester Stallone has a bit part, as does F. Murray Abraham, in his pre-Salieri days."
2,maybe i'm jaded,"one cannot miss the lemmon/bancroft energy, but this movie just left mefeeling nervous and dissatisfied...probably a great stage production, lots ofentrances and exits and knee-jerk laughs... not something i would want to seeagain unless i was feeling like 'i already feel bad and maybe, just maybe i missed someelement that would redeem the time'outdated and ill-used humor with stewardesses and gays..."
3,A Little Known Neil Simon Gem!,"It's really too bad that more people haven't seen or heard of this Neil Simon comedy, because their missing out on one of Simon's best films. This film in ways is like a sequel to Simon's ""The Out-Of-Towners"". What would of happened to the two lead characters in that film. Played wonderfully by Denise and Lemmon had they stood in New York? I think this is the answer. After Lemmon's ""big lawsuite"" lol, he probably would have went crazy from the big apple. Wonderful comedy teaming by Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft, I really can't think of anyone else in these roles! Simon, as always delivers a heartfelt, and extremely funny script that will please many. Several funny gags make this a must for Simon gags, and fans of good comedy. A little extra note: Try and spot Syslvester Stallone and F.Murray Abraham in two brief roles. Top notch Simon!"
3,Shrill Neil Simon Effort,"Neil Simon's work to me runs hot and cold. This seventies recession era farce was just plain annoying. Like in the worst Simon efforts the characters either scream at each other or tell jokes. Sorry, Neil, you're skating on a thin line on someone's nervous breakdown and you didn't pull it off here. This flick feels claustrophobic, barely transcending it's stage roots. The redeeming factors here are the performances of Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft who manage to imbue humanity into Simon's cartoon characters. Another plus are the radio announcements interspersed throughout the movie."
3,Hilarious Jack Lemmon,"No none plays a down and out, nervous, stresssed out character than Jack Lemmon; he was the greatest at that genre. You know the character is headed for a breakdown, but just like the role he played in ""The Out of Towners"", you can't help but give a laugh out loud for the horrible mess he's in or has created for himself. I guess he played the roles that we can all identify with at one time or another and laugh at it all-hey, it beats crying !"
1,wrong authors,"You list the authors incorrectly, The correct authors are Charles E. Martin and William H. George. Maybe if this error is corrected you can find a volum."
4,Merely Awesome,"Mereley Players is just an awesome Rush tribute. I've loved this band for over 25 years. The song list section just lets me know what I missed back in the old days when I was to young or to stoned to remember. Although, Mr Telleria should go back and redo the bad spelling and grammar in the Biography section before another issue is put on the shelf. There are just to many to mention. Over all it is just a great book."
3,Scrapbook,"This is basically a fan's scrapbook. It is a collection of interviews(from other sources, not the author) pieced together in an attempt to appear as a linear ""biography"" of the band. Many excerpts seem out of place and out of context. The juiciest claims in the book are not sourced. Most hard core Rush fan's are familiar with everything in this book. One interesting revelation is that much of the lack of recoginition seems to be RUSH's doing, not the various industry outlets. Most RUSH fans will want this to add to their collections, just don't expect anything new in it."
4,"Mr. Telleria - It's called an editor, look into it!","This book is great! Things I never knew. Things that surprised me. Things that gave me new insight. Plus I learned a ton about my favorite band! This book is loaded with great RUSH information. I really enjoyed it but some of the typos, grammatical errors and other writing problems are absolutely inexcusable. Also, Mr. Telleria's personal observations and assumptions are not needed. This book comes across as an archive of info but the occasional opinion mixed with middle school English report writing skills make this feel like a printed fan web site and not a tome to put on the shelf."
5,Dance Till Dawn,"I just came back from Argentina, where they played most of the songs in this collection. The Bob Marley, Ty-Med and ATB songs alone, are worth the price of the collection. Fortunateley the rest of the songs are great too."
1,piece of crap,"i had this belt for no more than a 4 weeks, the belt just broke on me, the little buckel came off and it wont work. I thought this was a really cool belt but the thing just wouldnt last."
4,It draws you right in,"Holland did a great job of intertwining a captivating fictitious story with real life elements and hard science. The saucy personalities of the characters kept the book fun and entertaining. I found myself looking for spare minutes during the day to get back to the book. All in all, great debut!"
5,Pickin' On Travis Tritt - Purchased from Amazon,"This CD is very well done. I really enjoy this type of music. Finding and ordering this CD was very easy, delivered fast and in good Shape."
2,If you actually like number theory...,"...stay away from this book. This book was required for an upper-division number theory course I took, and the teacher used it for one of our eight assignments. I assume he did this because there are few worthwhile problems in the book. The author spends too much time explaining the history behind the theorems and too little time discussing applications. He proves the theorems but the proofs make no sense to someone learning just from the book. The teacher for my course explained all of the theorems in ways that actually made sense and were easily reproducable. When studying I never looked at this book and instead used Nathanson's GTM for number theory. If you only care about the history of number theory, this book has some redeeming quality. Otherwise, stay away. Dover math books tend to be inferior to texts like UTMs and GTMs, as evidenced by the latter costing literally ten times as much sometimes."
3,Deceptive Title,"No concept is beyond the reach of an intelligent mind, so long as that concept is brilliantly explained. If there were a race for explanatory brilliance, this book would fall somewhere short of the starting line. For example, an appendix lists 58 mathematical symbols, (most of which you won't encounter in high school). These symbols are blithely used throughout the text, yet none is adequately explained. If you don't have calculus, statistics, trigonometry and a few other disciplines already firmly under your belt, forget this text. Of interest to all readers may be the occasional insets giving concise biographies of important mathematicians."
4,Its okay but....,I thought Jason used a machete? not a throwing axe. O well you dont have munch time to think about it because your about to die!! You get killed fast.
1,The Intro Is The ONLY Good Thing,"I was like many other kids at the time when this game came out. Thought it'd be cool to play a Jason game. Well, like many kids did, I threw this game into the junk pile quickly after getting it, sad that I wasted money on such a piece of garbage.-Graphics are what you'd expect from a NES game.-Controls are stiff and thumb-numbing.-Jason is stout and PURPLE!!-After a while of running around you want to yank the game out because the sound effects of the alarm are so annoying!-As many others have said, Jason is IMPOSSIBLE to beat!You're better off playingMike Tyson's Punch-Out,Urban Champion, orKung Fu. Unless you're looking to get this game to complete your collection of rotten games, DON'T GET IT!"
4,Jason is as difficult to kill as he is in the movies,"YOu don't know challenging until you have palyed Friday the 13th. For one thing time is always against you and the weapons (are bad). IT really follows no movie story line but still can hold it's own and provide many hours of gameplay.The music is basic NES style.Graphics are the same thing but has one of the coolest NES entrences ever, I won't spoil it.The controls are very smooth which is nice.The difficulty on am scale from 1-10, would be an 11. I mean this one difficult game as a whole. YOu will not be able to win on teh first try guarentted. YOu also have to beat Jason (all his HP drained) 3x and eaxh time he gets a little faster and a little stronger.However still buy this because it is fun. YOu won't regret it (your controller might though)."
4,Friday the 13th NES,This is one of those classic I used to play this as a kid and had to play it again type of games. It's entertaining with a decent plot.
4,"Detailed info, and still a lot of freedom","Yrth is great for playing Fantasy GURPS! The world is nicely detailed, and still there is a lot of freedom for GMs to develop their own Yrth. The only thing I miss in the world: the divine... (There are gods... true. But in a fantasy setting priests with very uniqe abilities give a flavour to the world... Especially if there are countless dieties..)I hope there is an Atlas to Yrth...One additional thing that doesn't relate to this product: my shipment was lost through the postal service, and the customer service at Amazon was so helpful (and effective), that I got the book free of charge and in 3 (!!) days (Thank you!)"
2,Too restrictive,"Banestorm had potential to be a great addition to the GURPS system but it falls flat. It takes the WoTC route of dictating to the GM what is and is not allowed in Banestorm which to me is a carnal sin in RPG's (and why WoTC is no longer an RPG maker IMO). They've put in far too many restrictions in their effort to have a ""uniform"" version of the setting that it feels very anti-GURPS in spirit. It also lacks maps of any usefulness."
5,We The People...,"Want to learn AND UNDERSTAND our Constitution? Not just 'think' you know what it is from what you hear from mass media sound bites and others seeking to 'fundamentally change America'. GET THIS TERRIFIC PUBLICATION THAT IS EASY TO READ AND FOLLOW, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, UNDERSTAND.KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALIKING ABOUT THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT YOUR COUNTRY AND ITS HERITAGE and the rights of We The People."
4,Looking forward to reading it.,"I havn't started reading it yet, but it is from the Heritage Foundation, and I recently took the Constitution 101 course. I am very pleased with the condition of the book and the speed that it was sent to me."
4,"Overall, a Solid Guide to the Constitution","As a former political science student, and current law student, I have a great interest in the U.S. Constitution. I have to say, the Heritage Foundation has put together a fairly solid guide to the Constitution with this book. Each clause is explained by prominent legal scholars, who reference not only key court cases, but also crucial historical documents such as The Federalist Papers. The only downside to this book is the fact that the editors allowed the controversial legal scholar John Yoo to co-write the articles concerning War Powers - I feel this is a big mistake. At any rate, even the articles co-written by Yoo are not too radical, and do a decent job of giving a fair overview of the issues at hand. Overvall, this is a great book for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of our Nation's founding document. I highly recommend it for undergraduates, law students, and curious citizens alike."
5,A must read for all Americans,"Well written, well documented, I wish the President and congress would read and heed this. Perhaps they would stop leading us down the failed path of statism."
4,solid source of information,Reliable and fairly up to date. I purchased this book in 2005 and was pleased with it.
4,A Conservative Guide to the Constitution,"If you are looking for something other than the liberal bias you get from most sources when learning about the founding documents of our nation, this is it. Here is the authoritive standard of constitutional interpretation stressing the original intent of the framers. It's explanatory, educational and easily accessible to all informed citizens and students of the Constitution."
4,Review of Heritage Guide to Constitution,I am not completely done going through this book but it reveals the history behind the thoughts that went into writing the constitution. It is fairly interesting and not difficult to follow. Good if you want some background into the laws of our land.
1,[...],"""It has come to our attention that the book 'THE THEORY OF EVERTHING: THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE' has been published.

1,IMPORTANT NOTE,"IMPORTANT NOTEIt has come to our attention that the book ""The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe"" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book.

3,slippery and young,"Good length but very slippery. I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around. I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now. For the price, why not? Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric. As far as the base product, it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
4,Looks cool,"I like the looks of it. It wasn't what I was expecting though. I thought all guitar straps came with a string to attach it to the neck of the guitar, but this one did not. I had to use a gross shoelace instead."
4,Lighting bolt Gibson strap,"I hope there had been a closer picture of the product.I was a little surprised when I got it because it doesn't look as great as I imagined.The white lightning is stamped on the black strap, the same goes for the GIBSON name on the end of it.Maybe it will get better looking in the long run."
5,wow simply amazing,"This stands as one of the two best RPGs of NES. Interesting story line which plays out throughout the game, as you are a boy hearing tales of your father being killed in a fierce battle with a dragon atop of a volcano. Then one day ofcourse you gather three of your friends (each can be modified with abilities and several other things) to go find out the truth for yourself. Along the way there are several adventures battling monsters, kings, dragons, yourselves and other things across a massive land full of secrets, towns, castles and towers. Another nice feature is that the game takes you back to the original world of Dragon Warrior, so there is a whole other game in itself within the game. This game is also available on Gameboy Color."
5,A Must Have.,You would never know that this is Mr. Seibert's first book. It is very well written. You can tell by the detail that the author did excellent research. The McKinley assassination seems to have been lost in our history. This book corrects that omission. You won't want to put it down.
3,Irony and romance,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It kept my interest very well, and the constand plot changes made the book very exciting. You never knew what was going to happen next. The irony in the book was very unlikely, however, Fischer was able to make it seem beliveable. I also enjoyed the way that Fischer put such emotion into the story. You could almsot feel how the characters were feeling. For example, after one of the characters, Sungae, an English as a second language student, was told to come up with one sentence that described her life, it showed how depressed she was. She came to America to escape her past, and now it was brought back into memory. I think Fischer described this so well, because she used to teach an English as a second language class. Overall, I was glad I picked up this book and decided to read it. Not only did it entice me with the amount of drama it had, it really showed how powerful love is. That is something that could be appreciated by everyone."
1,wish I'd bought another,"I am sorry I bought The Language of Good-Bye at LAX airport on a recent trip. I don't disagree that the writing is good, but the story line is so uninteresting. I don't have much interest in why a man who has cheated on his wife several times now seems so interested in his present affair, or why his girlfriend has decided to leave her husband. And they go on and on like high school students about how much they love each other. This tiresome story is all about their self-absorption and selfishness and I'm sorry I wasted my money. The Korean woman was the only interesting part of the story."
5,great series,My family and I have read the whole series and shared and laughed at these stories many times. They make a great share-read on family trips!
4,Yep,had it when I younger watch my dad play the game and I always wanted to try to play it I played it then and now I beat it now I was able to pick it up it's a great game I love it
5,Great value,"I looked for a shorter length of hardware cloth and found some, for a lot more than this roll. I made 5 compost bins out of this roll. The galvanizing has held up great, just as expected. I am amazed that I can have this shipped to me for cheaper than at a local hardware box store. Thanks"
5,Fencing,"If you want a wire fence that keeps out other animals, this will do the trick! Great to work with."
3,foot comfort,I tought that this would make my feet comfortable. to a degree it works.problem is that it is too soft and keeps coming off when I take my shoes offit need sto be more rigid or with adhesive so it will stay in shoes
5,tuli's gel energy,These insoles are the best I have ever tried. I work on my feet and walk on marble all day 8 hrs. So yes these are a 10
3,adult review,"I read this book about 25 years ago, when I was a thirteen year-old boy. While this book contains no literal war, it does describe a psychological war waged by a tough gang against a fairly lonely boy (can't remember name) whose only real outlet is running. This boy has no real support from home because his father is battling his own problems and other family members are absent.I remember the book as pretty interesting because of the different problems that are explored. It was one of the first times I read about such themes as alienation and dysfunctional families. The fact that the main character faces daily harassment and confrontation in a classic physical manner adds momentary excitement for those who don't have the patience to see more abstract topics take form, develop and resolve themselves. I don't dare to stick out my neck and give it four stars, but easily 3; again, this is the opinion of a 38 year old man."
1,Terrible,"I bought this CD and it is horrible, all the songs sound tinny. Thank goodness I only paid $5 when Tower Records was closing. Even $5 is too much for this CD. I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money."
4,Liked It,I personally enjoy British Novels by British Authors so I am a little biased & almost know I will enjoy this type of book since I was/am a huge Catherine Cookson Fan so based on that I enjoyed Nobody's Child
4,Good product but you can find it cheaper equivalent,"This is a double shielded RG6 coaxial cable with the rubber strain relief as shown in the diagram. The cable itself does not state whether the cable is double or quad shielded, but the write-up shows that it is double shielded. I have not installed this cable yet, but it looks like a good sturdy cable. However, having purchased the Monster 50 ft cable and the MediaBridge 50 ft cable at the same time, I think the best cable for the money is the MediaBridge cable since it is quad shielded. The Monster cable is double shielded, but it is cheaper and it is at least as good quality as this Philips cable."
4,Aid for studying Spanish,"I am a church musician who is studying Spanish partly so I can worship with and connect with the many people in our urban parishes who are Hispanic. This book is just what I was looking for. It is a nice size, easy to read, the English on one page and the Spanish equivalent on the opposite page. Although it is Catholic in content and I am Lutheran, it contains parts of the worship service and many concepts that are common to both. At this price it could be a wonderful gift for children or parents of young children."
4,Worthwhile,"Generally well-presented. I wish my short-term memory were better (I'm 73.); it's slow-going for me, someone who has prided himself on being able to learn languages. If I have problems, they're mine and not the book's. P.S.: I'm a retired language professor."
3,Seems to make a Difference,"I am using these behind a pair of Audioaccess AAS6 Speakers (2-Way In-Wall with 6.5-Inch Woofer and 1-Inch Titanium Tweeter) driven by an Onkyo TXSR308 receiver.The Wood Technology SC-2 In-wall Sound Chambers seem to make the sound in the room where the speakers are slightly richer, and the sound in the room adjacent to the speakers a little more muffled. Not a complicated product. List price is about $50.00 - I paid about $20.00 - Seems overpriced for what they are."
3,more black than white,"this book is very informative and no doubt desiree is an outstanding artist.if your purchasing this book for reference pictures, forget it! every photo is black and white and very, very dark. if the pictures were color she could get double the money for this book, i was very disappointed and curious if her other books are printed the same way."
4,"Wonderful pictures, Well done book!","This book is very well done, well laid out and the quality of the graphics are absolutely amazing. A great companion to have if your profession or hobby calls for baking, cooking, etc. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I find a few fruits missing from the book. Granted some of these are unusual fruits, but thats the reason to buy a book like this. No regrets buying it whatsoever, but I wish it had fruits, such as: Guarana"
2,Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 does not work with JVC HDD file,"Just to let you know that I tried Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 with the JVC HDD version SD camcorder file, the video editing software does not recongnize the JVC MPEG2 file as valid format for editing. The new JVC camcorder came out earlier 2007 record 720x480 16:9 format MPEG2 file on HDD.Sony Vegas 8 Pro also have problem editing that kind of file, but the video editing software from Germany Nero has no problem working with the file."
2,Not debugged. I should have waited..,"Spent 4-6 hours doing installs, reinstalling, and making multiple phone calls to Adobe. Talking with techs and customer support. Product did not install properly under Vista. Installed finally, but not fully working today. My packaging has a ""sticker"" on top it (like an after-thought) regarding windows Vista compatability.Product is still not working properly. Activation is a nightmare - Internal error 2739, starting regservers via command prompts, uninstall , turn off UAC, reinstall, activating the right application (s), and it still doesn't work right.I am sorry I wasted my time and jeopardized my career on MS Vista and Adobe Creative Suite compatability issues in a work /production environment. I should have waited. I give the combo 5 stars under frustration and a waste of time/money.Of course, your install may go smoother. I can only talk from personal experince with a sample of one machine."
4,a not as well known classic for the NES,"I can never remember how I got most of my old Nintendo games when I was a kid, but I am glad that Duck Tales is one of the games I owned as a child. To put it simply, this game is a lot of fun. You play as Scrooge McDuck and you are trying to become the richest Duck in the world (if he wasn't already). There are several (5 or 6, I can't remember) different areas each with its own boss. You are able to take out enemies by doing a pogo bounce on top of them with your cane. It is a simple (yet classic) way of beating the bad guys. Throughout the game you will see characters from the tv show (I no longer remember the names), including Huey, Dewey and Louie (Scrooge's nephews). With three difficulty levels, this game can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be. The game retains its replay value over time and is still a lot of fun to play."
5,Even the shortest game can succeed,"Ducktales is one of the very few games that prove that even the shortest game can succeed. There's only 5 levels, and you repeat 1, but those 5 levels are lengthy.The plot is that Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world, wants to be even richer by traveling around the world, finding treasures.You can go to Transylvania, the Amazon, the Moon, the Himalayas, and the African Mines.Ducktales shares certain similarities to MegaMan, like the level selection, how the levels scroll when you fall, and how there's a boss at the end of every level. In fact, Capcom made this game.The game is a nice side-scrolling platformer with impressive graphics and upbeat Capcom sounds and music."
5,From Off Magazine.,"Crocker's writing is of such eclectic manner that there's something in this book for all readers . . . this author stands out among modern day authors.--Chad Armbruster, editor of OFF!"
4,Very Good Overview of this subject,"Strong Examples, inspiring, and well thought out. The book gives a nice historic summary. Overall, the book is much better than most ""series"" books. Good for beginners to figure drawing."
1,not like ad.,I am very displeased with this company. Got these bulbs in a very poor packed box. The plastic box they were in was not sealed or labeled. And the bulbs had finger prints on them. Now tell me do you think these are new like the ad states. I returned them and told them and they do not care so I reported it to Amazon after I had a Detective look at them and take photos of them for further action. If you buy bulbs from this company please inspect closely.
1,Buyer be ware!,"Never have I had printer that was such a pile of junk. Constant paper jams and paper pickup failers. Yes, get use to the ""Out of Paper"" waring popping up. I bought the 3 year warrenty on this as well, big goof. Plan on a minamum of two hours with HP before gaining ground.Good Luck fuyure buyers!"
4,"Highly Detailed, Interesting Book","I first encountered this book, along with others in the ""Life in a. . ."" series about Native Americans, as I was going through a teacher training program in college. The 5th-grade classroom teacher who I interned with loved these books and used them every year during her Native American Social Studies Unit. And they are great books. With lots of relevant text combined with plenty of descriptive illustrations, this book is one of few that is historically accurate while being interesting. While some critics disliked the pictures, I thought the mix of illustrations and photographs gave the book balance and appeal to a wider range of readers. In addition, the information presented is detailed enough for students to use in reports or class projects. I highly recommend this book for kids 4th through 8th grade."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is attractive, informative and easy to read. Highly recommended, also for folks who want to check their heritage. Teens would enjoy it too, it's so colorful and the illustrations seem historically and culturally accurate."
2,Singleplayer crappiness evened out by multiplayer goodness.,"Unless you have Xbox Live, don't bother wasting any money on the game - not even for a rental. Multiplayer on Xbox Live is the only saving grace, if you don't mind only having 2 choices between controller setups - both only changing the button configurations, not the sticks. It seems like a crappier, Vietnam version of Counter-Strike while online in any close-quarters fighting. Overall, don't waste your money on this game when you could buy Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow or Star Wars: Battlefront instead. You could even just wait for Halo 2. If Vietnam is what you are looking for, wait for Men of Valor."
3,Not too bad,"I recently purchased this title and found it to be worth the price I paid...bargin bin. I took on a single mission last night and it was pretty fun even though the graphics could be greatly improved. I had to sneak through the jungle and take out each VC as they came up. One guy was hid so good he nearly killed my character! So I had to back up and go around and found him. I haven't tried an actual career mission yet though. I tried a couple of the tutorials and quickly found the drill sergeant to be very annoying with an extremely foul mouth. I wanted to kill him before the first tutorial was over but I had no gun! lol Well the second tutorial gave me a gun...well you know what I did then! lol Boom! lol I had to restart the tutorial but it was worth it! =) If you find this game real cheap, it's not too bad."
2,GOOD BUT FORGETTABLE.(XBOX VERSION),"Vietnam is the second most ""used"" subject for a war game-that is after WWII(Medal Of Honor vs.Call Of Duty vs.Brothers In Arms Vs.Wolfenstein vs. COMMANDOS).Personally i think that VietCong:Purple Haze is the worst Vietnam game(yet anyway) here are my faverite Nam games in order:Men Of Valor(XBox ONLY)BattleField:VietNam(on PC)Conflict:VietNam(on PS2)ShellShock:Nam `67(on XBox)VietCong:Purple Haze(on XBox)I like MOV over BF:V because MOV was more exiting to me for some reason even though they are both Vietnam FPS games.VC:PH is not underated-its just that there are better Nam games out at the same time and it falls into that ""clone catorgory"".Unless you are a HARDCORE Vietnam games fan,have the other 4 games there are no other reason to get it"
1,wee wee,"Good with all new the software on the war of Vietnam Ca becomes wearying. Vietcong, is not super why, with dimensions graphs C when same drinkable one already saw worse for exit recent but the difficulty C that in this plays there no ambience one is evil has to be put in the skin of our heroes and the decorations of the jungles are really badly fact what still gives us moin the impression to be there. the scenario is lamentable A this to ask whether it has of them really enememis car of everywhere one never knows or Ca thus comes one makes similar one draws in all the directions without knowing on what one aims the fan of fps exactly style M.O.H as me will be very disappointed of this vietcong. short to divert some time little but not more. Men of valor has the air much better."
1,Does Amazon.com Sell Ear Plugs with this CD?,"Honestly, if you're even thinking about purchasing this CD, stop! STOP NOW! It would not be a wise investment. I've heard good music and they do not come close. Their sound is weak. They're lyrics are not strung together in a good fashion. They come off as airy and unpassionate. Please stear clear."
5,great hand warmer,"This hand warmer is extra large and comes with a Velcro pouch inside that holds the ""hot hands"". It is made of sweat pant material so it keeps your hands comfortable as well as nice and warm."
4,Football Fan!,"This product was given to someone who is a football fan and was wondering how she could get a hand warmer just like the ones the pros use during a game but didn't want any particular team logo on it. So,Thanks again to Amazon and the many companies they deal with they made it easy for me to locate this item. She was sooo surprised when she opened her gift and has been wearing the hand warmer while watching the remaining pro football games this season. She loves how the ends are cuffed and not opened."
1,"Don't order this ""expedited"" -- it'll be canceled!","I ordered this a week before Christmas and paid extra to get it here as quickly as possible. 6 days after I ordered it and received an e-mail confirmation I was told the order was canceled because the item cannot be shipped ""expedited"" since it is ""hazardous."" It would have been nice to be told that at checkout so I didn't waste the week before Christmas assuming I already had a gift! I'm sure it's a great product, but be warned if you need it fast..."
5,A Must Have,"This is a great CD to start your day off with a praise.There is something on this CD for everyoneI loved this CD not just because its a great CD but also because my friend and brother in Christ Reginald ""Footie Covington is on it.(Track #10 Footie's Medley)Footie you represented Church of the Living God well."
3,"Poorly recorded, but a good listen","Like the classic Blues records from Paramount Records, this set is poorly recorded, but a good listen.One has great difficulty hearing the vocals on this one, as they sound off-mike and some of the instruments are hard to hear.However, this CD has it's good points. For one, the great Robert Randolph and the Family Band appear on one track. On ""You Got To Move,"" the boy wonders begin with R/R delivering a haunting into and a startling vocal performance from Danyel Morgan (organist John Ginty is sadly missing from this set). Two other excellent tracks are ""If I couldn't Say A Word"" and ""Footie's Medley,"" which mixes James Cleveland's classic ""Jesus is the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me"" and ""The Pink Pahter Theme"" (beleive it or not, it works)!You may have to strain your ears to enjoy some of this, but it's good-time music that's worth a listen."
2,Too broad and general,I would NOT recommend this book unless you are planning to have multiple cosmetic procedures and want ONE book to cover them all. If you are looking for in depth information on one specific surgery then this is not your book. I was only interested in BA and read that information in 10 minutes or less. This book was a waste of my money!
2,Boring,"I am sorry to rate this so low but I just finished doing this with my 7 year old daughter and was surprised to see how boring this video is. The poses in the end are way too challenging to be useful (Bakasana and Tittibhasana). And, okei, the kids are cute but we ended up fast forwarding the kids section to the next pose. I would like to find a fluid yoga program that I could do with my child instead of a list of asanas. But if you want to learn one pose at a time then I suppose this is okei."
5,Awesome album!,"I just bought this record, and I love it. Listened to it driving in the rain last night. Great lyrics, listen to them, they'll haunt you just a little."
4,Works well for 96 Civic,"Bought product to replace front passenger window regulator in my 96 Civic. The part was just what we needed and the window is working again. There was a spring in this new product that was absent from the original piece, as seen in the product picture. We were hesitant to install it at first because we were afraid the spring would put too much stress on the motor since the original piece did not have the spring. Not sure if the old motor will hold up much longer, but as of right now, things are working fine!"
5,One of the most addictive games I ever played,"I once spent a whole two-week summer vacation playing this game with my cousins.In one-player mode, you're Genghis Khan, ruler of just one small area of Mongolia, and you have to conquer and subdue the entire country, region by region.In multi-player mode (I recall that there could be four players max), you're the leader of a united nation, seeking to conquer the world.There's not a lot of action involved. When you go to war, you direct the troop movements and attacks, but it's all strategy. When you're not at war, most of the game involves training soldiers, trading with other nations, etc."
3,"Very Basic General Vague info on Rolfing , good for Beginners","This is a good starter book, its written as simply totally vague random quotes from Dr. Rolf over many years on many different sub topics of Rolfing , its just a collection of her various short articles and small parts of her speeches all jumbled together randomly .This book will NOT give you any deep detail profound insights or understandings into Rolfing or Human Anatomy , if you want that and want to be deeply challenged intellectually than you need to read her older Huge book : THE INTEGRATION OF HUMAN STRUCTURESThis is a very basic general book and leaves out alot of details , its simply an short Over view of Rolfing and most of whats in the book you can read for free online on various sites ."
5,A great song!,"Awesome vocals, a good beat, ya can't stop singing!!!It's a really really good song!!! I love it!!"
2,Read for Class Assignment,Anton Chekov is such an interesting man. Most of his stories were first drafts. I can't imagine! As an author it's always a good idea to know our literary history.
5,Wonderful stories,A treat to have these on my kindle. More reward per minute of reading than with novels.This collection is highly recommended.
5,Shocked with my find!,"Aselin is an outstanding new singer and I was amazed with her cd when I bought it. Her songs are all very well sung and her lyrics really have meaning, unlike lots of pop/rock these days. Overall I would have to say this cd is totally worth purchasing!"
3,Bigger Than Me,"If you like Aselin Debison this is a nice CD, but not as good as Sweet Is the Melody. Knowing what I know now I would still buy the album."
5,Inspiring!,"Aselin is an amazing young lady, a God send & her music is so inspiring. All of her songs on ""Bigger Than Me"" made me cry, esp ""I miss you"" because it's not only a beautiful; but like all girls her age, they have to go through alot of life's lessons & heart aches.I can't put this CD down, I love it.I also have her first CD, ""Sweet is the Melody"" which also pulled at my heart strings!Keep it up Aselin! You're an angel! God bless you!"
5,Grows with each listen,"Whenever I get stressed out as a teacher, I listen to Aselin and I get lost in a better place. The newer ""Bigger Than Me"" took more time than her first venture to fall in love with But with each listen, it grew more and more endearing. She is amazing singer/songwriter and will lift your spirits no matter where you are ( mine in Long Island NY traffic ) and bring you to a better place. Now my only complaint is when are you going on tour - we need you here in NYC. Fast, no, make that slow..."
4,"Gruesome, nasty and downright entertaining.","After viewing the infamous ""Faces Of Death"" (The Original Faces of Death: 30th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray]) series, i was looking for the next step in this genre of movies and i decided to go with this. Featuring live suicides, executions and people just being stupid, this dvd is definitely disturbing to say the least even for someone who thinks they've seen it all. I would definitely not recommend this video to anyone below the age of 17 and if you are planing on purchasing this dvd i do recommend first buying the Faces Of Death just to prepare yourself. And although it may sound bad, this is very addicting to watch. Every fiber of your being will want to turn away but its very hard to resist watching which is where it gets its ""entertainment"" value."
2,More like for an adult with child supervision,"My daughter received this for Christmas. It states that this is for ages 8+, but there is no way a child could do this craft. We encountered the following issues: 1. there were not enough colored tiles to make the picture as directed; 2. the glue in the packet was hard; 3. there was not nearly enough grout (good thing we had some left over from a bathroom project); 4. the sticky papers that we kept having to transfer the tiles to did not hold them in place. However, the final product looks pretty good, but this is definitely not one for the crafty challenged family."
4,Allows easy handling of my guitar,It is flexible and comfortable to wear. The leather straps I own are too stiff. This strap aids in quick access to my guitar by slipping quickly over my head.
5,Super source of information,"If you ever wondered whether you were maximizing your workouts, and wanted to locate a good source of information, this book is for you. One of the finest ""one-book"" overviews out there. Easy to read, easy to understand, and packed with useful and easy-to-understand information that you can take right to the gym. Have used the book to produce great results in the gym, and have passed it on to friends who are doing the same. Highly recommended."
2,just book,just couple minds about training. All of this you can find on dr sqat website. Dont buy.......
2,dont waste your time,"i mean what do u expect, ofcourse its gonna be brutle but just not enough shock, mostly boring n just dead bodies,,this movie was so short not even an hour long :((( dont waste your time!!"
5,Hated to put this book down.,"Ms. McCullough thoroughly knocked my socks off. In the first chapter I got a tad discouraged because of so many characters, but soon came to know them ALL. Her thoroughness in describing the characters and their families was a plus as I continued to read. The book had no dull moments and many many twists and turns. I loved the way all was explained in the ending that some novels lack. I truly was entertained!"
2,Don't waste your time!,"Good premise and I like reading serial murders, especially gruesome ones, so that was not the turn-off for me. Instead it was Ms. McCullough's writing style. Her narrative condescends to her reader, dialogue was unbelievable and stilted, and all the time I was reading this book, I felt I was stuck reading a violent Ms. Marple book! In other words, this book drags! There are so many better serial murder books that grab you by the throat and don't let go from page 1. I suggest Ms. McCullough should pick up books by Thomas Harris, early Patricia Cornwell & Tess Gerritsen for writers who know how to do the grisly murder genre correctly. Big Pass!"
3,"I'm a huge McCullough fan, but she needs more practice","Colleen McCullough is at her best when she writes sweeping epic novels that span generations. I found On, Off to be too much in a short period of time. I got lost with her introduction of the ""suspects,"" one after the other, and as each suspect was revisited later in the book I had to flip back to refresh my memory as to who each one was. The ending was odd, and I didn't completely understand it. I felt it didn't tie up all the loose ends or answer all the questions, and in fact didn't quite make sense with a plot point that had been established before, namely, that an opthamologist had confirmed the ""sister's"" ""blindness.""The subplot of a Black Panther-like group protesting the killings was unnecessary. I felt it was a contrivance to eliminate the murderer before he went to trial.It was a good first effort, but Ms. McCullough needs more practice to perfect her forary into this new genre."
3,Disappoints - Sorry!,"I love Colleen Mc., especially her series on Rome. Those series manifest a serious and meticulous research had been done. This one is a throw-away...a bit predictable, with a not very interesting protagonist - Carmine Delmonico. Even the name is not too imaginative. At least the author gives him someone to love, and Desdemona is a more complex character. The book starts out with a challenging series of murders, but then, as the bodies pile up, the author seems to lose steam, wrapping all up in a very deux ex machina way. Those who love CMc should just go ahead and stick to the Rome stories!"
3,Hard to Follow,It took me forever to read the book. I found all the characters hard to keep track of and seems less would have been better. I couldn't figure out what On Off had to do with the book until the last page and even then found the ending to be a disappointment and didn't relate much.
3,good,Later fiction starring Carmine Delmonico are better. Features a lot of violence against young women (rape with sharp blades and so forth).
1,"On, Off is Awful, Awful","I have never written a review before, but if I can stop one person from wasting their money and time on this book, then I will be satisfied.I have enjoyed several of Colleen McCullough's novels in the past, and I'm an avid detective novel reader, so I was excited to see this book at the bookstore. I can't find it in my heart to forgive the author for ever having this book published. The story was lame, the ending ridiculous, but the objection I have that nobody else has covered is that the grammar is atrocious! I had to reread sentences just to figure out subject and verb. Numerous times there weren't even sentences. The fragments made the story difficult to follow. Did the author need the money? I'm sorry to say she got mine.I donate my used books to charity to allow the next person to read and enjoy them. I threw this book away."
3,Mostly On,"This novel has had mixed reviews. This is not surprising since it represents a major shift in topic, time, and voice for the author. Colleen McCullough has written many fine historical fictions which have both informed and educated. This novel suffers from comparison with the others.This piece of crime fiction came as a shock to me. I believe that it is a better book than it has been given credit for being. This is probably mostly because her other books are so good.On, Off is well worth reading, but not like other McCullough novels.I found that as I read the story I had the impression that I was watching a film from the 1960s. The image of period-suited characters presented itself as if on a movie screen. This could have been a film by Hitchcock.I gave On, Off 3 stars, but it's a strong 3 stars."
1,worthless drivel,"when i saw the name, colleen mccollough, i thought, oh good, an irish novel. so much for names equalling themes. i did plow through the book, skipping here and there. the ending was ridiculous and while i like the genre, too many characters, too much that is unbelievable, like a woman leaping 10 feet from one balcony to another. in short, don't waste your time."
2,The soaker hose I recieved didn't match the description.,"The soaker hose I recieved didn't match the description or picture. Instead of having holes every 6"" and output 2 GPH per foot, it had holes every 12"" with each hole having a 1/2 gph dripper. Fortunately the seller refunded my money."
1,"WEDGETS, WASTE OF MONEY",I ORDERED THIS TOY FOR MY PRESCHOOL GROUP. THEY PLAYED WITH IT ONE TIME AND HAVE NOT TOUCHED IT SINCE!! THEY SHOW NO INTEREST IN IT. IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.
5,difficult game,my nephew likes this game.I couldn't even get past the first board my nephew could and he younger than me
5,Una Noche Mas,This CD is much different than Resurrection but it is just as good. It is all in Spanish and even though I can't understand aword I love listening to it anyway. I can't wait for his next release.
5,Una Noche Mas Rocks,"Chris Perez Band new album is an awesome c.d. This shows that they haven't forgotten about tejano and that they can be very creative like mixing a bit of rock and tejano vibes. With Chris's guitar sounds and John sound but as well as Roland and Alex sound they make a awesome band. This is a new sound unhird of in tejano and rock will keep the people wanting more. Keep theme coming guys, the c.d.'s rock."
2,Una Noche Mas - not another Resurrection.,"I was hoping that Una Noche Mas would be a great rocker like Resurrection, but it's not. Chris's 2nd CD is good Tejano music not Rock.I'm forcing myself to listen to it. But after 3 tries, I still haven't finished.'Waiting for another Resurrection......Lew W.Honey Brook, PA(40 miles West of Philadelphia, PA)"
2,Blast Away,"I bought this video in hopes of getting a easy to follow video that would help me feel good with daily exercise without a lot of hassle. Much to my surprise, this video was extremely frustrating-it was very hard to follow the instructor and anticipate what was about to happen next. Half the time, I stood there watching the video wondering where she was and where it was going. This in light of the fact that I am not a novice at aerobics and even a former ballet dancer,I couldn't even keep up. It bummed me out-and after the third try-I gave up. A big dissapointment it was. Not to mention that all the hollering during it is extremely annoying. I tried, but in the mail it goes for a return."
4,put a smile on you're face,"I liked this video a lot, and it is a wonderful aerobic exercise. Tracy gives you a lot of energy and is very encouraging. I like that there are little segments, so when i'm short on time I'll only do one or two segments. Its great everyone should own it."
3,Crunch and munch,"I just recently brought this video and have done it twice. So far I give it a 3. This is NOT a workout for beginners. I consider myself an intermediate at aerobics. Most of the moves look fun, but it's going to take me a long time to get them down! I think there are way too many people in this video and the way the camera is on a different person/body part each second is horrible. It's hard to learn a move when the camera isn't focused on the full body of one or two people. This required a lot of rewinding. I don't know if it's just my video, but the sound quality isn't that great. Maybe that's way the video was only ($) at Ross."
1,Workout that requires a lot of space,"I have purchased the tape in hope that it would be a change from another instructor I normally use. The method in use is of combination of 4 moves (4 repetitions in each loop) so that makes the workout to change all the time fast. Also, I felt that I need a lot of space and then it would not have been easier to keep track of the moves."
1,CD with uneven shape,"One of the two CDs was in such a bad physical shape that it nearly damaged my Bose Music Wave System. It would not eject from the system because of its uneven shape. When I called Bose Company to report the problem, I was asked to ship the Music Wave System to them to remove this CD, costing me $99, excluding shipping and tax. Well, I could not afford it so I risked to open the machine myself to remove the CD, thus causing some slight damage to my precious Music System. I inserted same CD into my Sony DVD player and I could not believe the mechanical noise created. This convinced me that it is the CD that is damaged, and not my Music Wave System. The other CD is fine and plays ok on my system.Honestly I regretted purchasing the product for less $10 that has or nearly has damaged my over $800 Music Wave System. Now I am scared to insert another CD into my Music System, because of the slight damage I caused in trying to remove this CD from it by myself."
3,Good collection,This cd set is a compilation of the best musical experiences Passion had to that point. I enjoy Chris Tomlin and Christy Nockels. I like Matt Redmans song Blessed Be Your Name. But I do not care for The David Crowder Band at all. I skip all those songs. Not too big on Charlie Hall either. So much of the cds was a waste for me. Could have kept it to one cd by eliminating those artists. The stories in the cd liner are fascinating.
5,The Best of Passion (so far) Christian Music CD,"I bought two of these CDs - one for me and one for a gift. It was an excellent blend of praise and worship music with wonderful artists. It was also much less expensive, even with shipping included than the music stores."
4,Good for Sable' Breton,"I use this item for Sable Breton, lately one of my favorite preparations. I have noticed that when used without parchment (baking) paper it can leak a little, not a big deal in my opinion, I will see if after some break-in the leak continues."
5,The Messenger,"This was just what I expect from this author. He weaves a ""real"" story into his fiction novels so well. It makes me want to go back and reread his other works."
3,Could be better...,"I think that this book is not nearly as good as the Hitchhiker's trilogy. It just doesn't manage to be cohesive enough and several plot elements seemed to make absolutely no sense. It does have some very good scenes, such as the monk and the ghost. However, most of the book was rather dull."
2,Holistic Detective Agency,"5/20/09 Just could not get into this book. Didn't finish it, might go back to it at another time..... maybe."
3,"Gets points for trying to be different, but is average","""Dirk Gently's Holistic Dectective Agency"" is an OK book. It is a different kind of mystery, as Douglas Adams intended. However, I found this book quite inferior to the ""Hitchhiker"" series, as it did not have that same pizzaz. Basically, there has been a murder, and some try to solve it. Dirk, the detective in the title who doens't appear until about 1/2 way through, is not interested in solving the murder, no, he wants to know why Richard McDuff, an employee of the victim, climbed into his girlfriend's flat. That McDuff's girlfriend is the victim's sister is beside the point. Dirk feels that all things are interconnected, and also wants to figure out how an old professor managed to do an impossible trick. Soon, we discover, the prof has a time machine, and there is a ghost who wants to reverse a billion year old error, which would mean the end of all life. A few chuckles, but mostly headscratching."
1,But please for god's sakes don't take my word for it,Boring. Boring. Boring. Slow. Dull. (I'm running out of synonyms here) I think you get the point. I couldn't even read the whole thing. It's the second book ever (and I read constantly) that I've thrown down in discust.
3,Not his best work,"I read this book, because I have read everything else written by Douglas Adams so I figured I should read this one too. I was wrong. This book was not on the same level as his other works. It was as if Adams was trying to set himself appart from his other works and in doing so he completely abandoned what made him so lovable in the first place. The characters were cool and the storyline was just as convoluted as you would expect an Adams book to be, but it just didn't have his usual flare."
3,Diana,"My daughter really liked this book-she asked for it. Although I knew it was used, it is obviously used, and somewhat worn, but still viable. It arrived way ahead of schedule and in time for Christmas gift giving."
5,Superlative humour,"This book is extremely funny. Simple. It is also extremely unusual. No surprise there, this is an Adams book. It is also one of the best books i've read.. ever. I personally think it is better than the Hitch-Hiker books because we can all relate to the environment. Read it.... now."
4,A devastatingly imaginative detective story. After page 146.,"This book does not compare to the Hitchhiker's Guide, nor is it, I suspect, meant to. The hero is an ex-con who got sent to the slammer for helping people con themselves and then delivering on the false promises he didn't actually make. (If you want that to make sense to you, read the book.) The story then runs on and on and on till you're only reading for hope's sake. Suddenly the detective tale jumps out of stereotype and you're left gasping at the author's imagination. Unless you've got time to kill, try an abridged version."
5,Complicated,"This is a superb, but highly complicated book. Because most of the story went over my head the first time I read it, I didn't even finish it. However, I went back and tried again and much to my surprise it was great. I recomend it to anyone who is an intelligent reader and is willing to reread things. In my opinion, this is Douglas Adams's finest work."
3,A good book bu Adams has done much better,This is a really funny book but HHGTG fans may take awhile to get used to it. The slow begining and the long boring segments plus the out of place part kind of ruins it
3,eh...,"I'm a big fan of Douglas Adams, but it took me years to get around to reading this book. I still have to read the Tea-time story, as both novels came in one book. After I got through Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, I felt ...disappointed. Its fine to go on a ride with ghosts, time-machines and dodo's and all, and I think Dirk's character is the most interesting character in the book, but over-all, the story felt lacking. I'd describe it as having a very, very slow start, an exciting middle, and an abruptly inconclusive end that wasn't exactly exhibiting the interconnectedness of all things. I was particularly confused by Gordon Way's story line, he and Dirk being the more interesting and fun characters of the book."
2,Waste,This book sucked big time. The writing style was entertaining for the first 5% of the book (reading on a kindle) but gets old quick. It's kind of snarky and the freshness wares quickly because the author comes off as better than his readers. He takes a page or more to describe something as simple as a lamp shade and then you realize it has nothing to do with anything. I'm now over 20% through the book and it is going no where. Don't waste your time on this one.
5,Better than Hitchhiker's,"Douglas Adams is, of course, widely known for the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series, which is a wonderful pan-galactic romp. For my money, the Dirk Gently books (this volume and ""The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul"") surpass ""Hitchhiker"", which is no small feat.Adams fans will recognize his unique style. No one is as smartly silly as he is. No one.Dirk Gently, the slacker-slash-detective with the Zen-like attitude and unflappable nature, finds himself in the middle of a battle of gods...what else? From the campus of a prestigious university to the chambers of Valhalla, Dirk's cavalier attitude guarantees the reader a barrel of laughs from start to finish.Get both volumes at once. Like all of Adam's work, the read is quick and easy, and you won't want to stop once you've finished the first book."
4,For the fans!,"I wouldn't recommend this book (or this series, as there is a sequel to this book:Long, Dark Tea-time of the Soul) as a first encounter with the author, Douglas Adams. To get to know Mr. Adams' writing style (intriguing stroy with a comedic undertone and a clear portion of absurdity) I'd recommend the 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'-series (5 books).For the fans however, this is a must read (followed, back to back, with the sequel). The book reads very fluently and the story keeps a good pace. All this with the humorous aspects we've come to know from Mr. Adams. Definitely worth the space on your bookshelf (right next to the hitchhikers-series)!"
4,It's Good.,"This is a detective spoof by Douglas Adams and it is not as funny as Hitchhiker's Guide, but it is still a worthy read, if you're a fan of that series. The strong influence of Monty Python is more visible here so, if you like Monty Python, you might like this book...The story is possibly the strangest thing I have ever tried to decipher into logic. There was a sequel and it was far better, and more understandable. But, this is worth it still!"
4,More math than expected,"Hi thereThis book includes more math than practical examples, and issuch more on the theoretical side of network design.But I think the book is great, and the examples are fruit forthought, just a pitty some of the other reviewers aren't grownup so they can recognize it.I have used it several times for my thesis about IPv6 network design- even though it doesn't mention IPv6 at all!Best regards"
3,could be better,This book discusses some detailed design methods for networks. Many of the problems worked through are not described well. Several times the author makes huge jumps in logic that are not explained. Other times formulas are presented without explaination of where they come from. The companion software is very terse and not easy to use. It lacks the simple ability to navigate in the open file dialog box. The approach to network design emphasizes the approach from a mathamatician's point of view and because of its complexity would not be used by most organizations. It's all nice in theory but is not practical to use in the real world.
1,Don't but it unless you want to waste your time and money,The author of this book should have never received his degree. The book is very confusing and vaguely describes any mathematical process in arriving to its conclusions. An example of this is in chapter two where the author attempts to describe call blocking but ignores any input traffic to the system. The author obtains values from thin air and does not describe how the process used in obtaining the answers. This type of confusing gibberish is seen through out the book. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this book.
1,Waste of time and money -DON'T BUY IT,This is one of the worst books written in the field. The author barely shows how he came to any mathamatical answers in the book. His theories and math also have many holes in them and therefore they should not be trusted. Honestly the author of the book should go back to college to learn how to write in a scientific manner and learn basic stats.
4,Slippers of comfort!,"These are so very comfortable and cozy while being easy to thrown on and off (a MUST for me!). And they're completely washable so that when you're kneeling down to get the dust bunnies out from under your 4 yos' bed, you can easily get the dirt and dust off your black slippers!"
3,Nice look,I really liked the slippers..only catch is they run small..probably a full size smaller..I ended up giving them to my roommate..who loves them by the way..didn't work out too well for me though!
5,Love the deerfoams!,These are the most comfortable slippers I have worn in a long time! They are durable (I wear them all day long most days) and a great bargain!
1,"Tom Sawyer, Detective","This is NOT the 1938 movie of Tom Sawyer, Detective. It is the text of the book itself, which may be fine for those who want to read the book on their tv screen. In my view, it should not be listed for sale under ""movies."""
5,Read this book.,"First, I'm not real generous when it comes to giving a full ""five stars"" and have read easily over 100 travel essays. This book is the most enjoyable and enlightening I've read. I first read it over 2 years ago and have given copies out to several friends. Each one loved it.I just picked it up again (a real rarity for me). It's every bit as good as I recalled. Insightful with respect to both the places he visits as well as the author's introspection. Wonderful imagery- articulate, adjective-filled.Read this book."
4,Berger is King of Wagnerite Valhalla,"American humorist Mark Twain wryly obeserved, ""Wagner's operas are not as bad as they sound!"" With wit, warmth, expertise and instructions on rest room breaks this book will enterain you! Berger is a musician and linguist who is able to explain the byzantinian plots of Wagnerian opera with simplicyh, conciseness and humor. As an opera fan with a general knowledge of Wagner I found the book useful. Useful because:1. He has a good plot synopsis of each major Wagner opera2. He gives a brief but adequate sketch of the life of the titatnic German anti-semtic genius.3. Berger includes the best books, CD's and videos for the neophyte as well as the experienced fan of a titanic but flawed genius. Relish Berger's witty style as you learn more about a great artist. Highly recommended."
1,bad suggestion for wagner fans,this book is a poor reccomendation for those who appreciate wagner's music.
1,Unbelievably bad,"This is not only the worst book I have ever read about Wagner, but probably the worst book I've ever read on any subject. Witless, so full of mistakes one doesn't know where to begin, unfunny (all the worse, because the author clearly takes himself for a wit); full of tedious conceits (examples: 'When to visit the restroom' and 'Rough spots and how to get through them').If you want a rest, stay at home. If you want to pee (or piss) during an interval, say so: it would be unusual to find anywhere to rest where you're going. If you find Wagner tedious, go to a musical. If you want to read an illuminating book on Wagner, buy Bryan Magee. If you should happen to need some absorbent paper for one of your visits to the 'restroom', buy this book. Actually, don't - it isn't even cheap.Richard Miles"
1,wagner for imbeciles,is the author serious...does he really think that adult operagoers need to know when to go to the toilet? I cannot believe that opera notes need to include suggestions on when/what to eat and when to visit the restroom. Do yourself a favour and but some other book on Wagner (...)
5,Superb!,"For the price, I had high expectations of the book - when I received it, it honestly surpassed them by FAR. The color, quality (all have been perfectly retouched), layout & ads they chose for inclusion are fantastic. A real collector's item & treasure in anyone's library. I've bought many ""retro style"" books and this is the best purchase I've made."
3,"Reviewed by Jerronious of Lake City, FL","Average read for the student of forensics. As a text book it is notvery in depth and would probably be considered amateurish, at best, for anypathology student. The book was easy to read and added to myknowledge of Forensics. I would recommend the book if you have nothing elseto do. The book contains poor quality black and white photos. The book wouldbe considerably better of printed on better quality paper and used updatedimaging and photos of crime scene. The price is way out of range for thequality and quantity of information it contains."
5,Recommended Coloring Book if interested in Knights,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in knights. The illustrations are tightly rendered with precision and detail, and appear to be historically accurate. In order to retain the details in each drawing,I recommend coloring the images using quality colored pencils instead of crayons. This coloring book was purchased for my 11-year old nephew to accompany a collection of PAPO knights. He liked the coloring book, but appreciated the actual figurines more. However, I loved coloring in his book along with him, and from that, he learned how to overlap and mix colors for added depth."
2,Verbose explanation of government forms...,The book is very wordy and simply explains (in legalese) line by line the government forms you need to fill out. Also the forms on the floppy are in Macintosh Format(s) (Adobe Acrobat & some other format .rev?) If you write software and are looking for a book to verbosely explain the steps you need to take to protect your software this is it...
1,I still haven't recieved my purchased items,I still haven't recieved my purchased items!!How can I contact Amazone to let you know.Can you tell me what happened?Please contact me.Inge
2,Not the best DVD from hi-5 to buy!!,"My baby girl don't even blink when Hi-5 DVD is playing, she sings she dances and so on, however this specific DVD has only the themes songs playing over and over, is a little boring and repetitive so she watched the first two songs and then just walked away.It's a no go at least for us!!!"
5,great song!,"This song is very worshipful. I love it because it reminds us, as Christians, that we were made to love God, not the other way around, that life is about serving Him. Great song!"
4,Worth every penny!,"Very Comfortable, Can be dressed up and down. The photo doesnt do the watch justice, its looks a hundred times better on."
1,Dead out of the box.,"When I pay $99 for a travel alarm clock, I surely expect that it will be of excellent quality. WHen mine arrived it was dead right out of the box. I called the company and was told that I would have to accept a merchandise credit rather than a refund. As if I would every buy anything else from them!Save your money--this company obviously does not care about quality."
2,not what is shown,ordered these for the guys i work with. have ordered them in the past so i just went by the picture showing the ones i have ordered several times but that is not what i got. i got clear. the item description stated clear but the picture was tinted and mirrored. i did get my money back but they have yet to change picture.
5,A Very Pleasurable Mix,"I still consider myself a rock music fan, but received this CD/album as a Christmas gift in 1995, and have listened to it in my car countless times. It contains a very nice assortment of familiar arrangements performed brillantly by various orchestras. Even if the title doesn't ring a bell, chances are you've heard these songs before and can connect with them. My wife's favorite is ""Canon"" (she's a diehard romantic) and I'm partial to ""Fanfare"" (Masterpiece Theater's old theme). Guaranteed to mellow you out while stuck in rush-hour traffic."
3,Eh.,Its good but not what I was looking for for my '91 Cressida. Really vague and alright drawings. NOT OEM MANUAL!
1,"Hilariously, brazenly incompetent work","I own a Toyota van, and have had no choice but to rely on this book to help me repair and maintain it. This manual is useless to the point of being dangerous. There are mistakes on every page; entire sections or pages are either left out or printed twice. The diagrams (and I'm speaking as an architect who is trained to understand such things), of which there are far too few for the van, are an indecipherable mess. I WISH there was some other source for the Toyota Van - the Hanes manual for my previous VW Jetta was a comprehensive, easy to use masterpiece - but unfortunately not. It is mind-boggling that the Chilton people actually published this book - somebody should be serving time for producing this complete fraud of a car-maintenance manual."
1,"poor,poor toyotas","well, where can i start if you own a toyota van 86 thru 89 van wagon and you aren't a venturing mechanic meaning you try to figure how to fix it yourself by your own mechanical know how, don't buy this book it really doesn't give you alotta details on your toyota van."
2,Not Impressed,I had high expectations to learn more about this subject and felt let down - the book was tiny and vague. I am glad I didn't spend alot because after reading it I simply gave it away - I won't be purchasing anymore of this books in the future.
2,not sure about the science,"I don't think chicken is making my health worse or making me fat, but eh... what do i know?"
2,A different sort of theory.,"My son is AB negative and I bought this to add to his sack of birthday gifts for July 7. Since he has not had an opportunity to try it out, it remains a fun gift at this point."
1,Junk Science (1 star is as low as it goes),"This idea that foods are ""bad"" for someone is not supportable with science. ANY food in great levels is ""bad."" NO food (That one is not allergic to) ia any worse than any other.This is just a context of a person selling a book with an idea that is not supportable with science to gullable people. (Seems to be a common thing with the nutrition ""experts"" that all they do is make people afraid of something, then tell them to avoid it.)"
2,"Lots of historic information, tedious presentation","It's a history book! If you love Hugh Johnson and love history, you'll love this. Well I love WINE and really like Hugh Johnson and I can't seem to finish this book!"
2,Bad,"It's playable, but only just. Let me see...The graphics are blocky and terrible, the controls stink, and a menu needlessly takes up half the screen. It's impossible to jump holes with any character but Raistlin, and Goldmoon, a female character, even gives the same grunt as the males when she is hurt. Characters not in battle still take damage. The doors don't line up with one another or with the compass, so map-making is nearly impossible.The fantasy party of adventurers is pretty cool, and you'll probably still enjoy this one if you've read the book. Otherwise, it's a real stinker."
1,Pricing,"I was shocked to see that these are selling for over $15 on Amazon. My local grocery store carries this exact same product for $8.99! The product itself gets 20 stars because my Beagles literally dance for them... but the pricing gets a big BOO! I always shop Amazon because I know I can get terrific prices, that's why I was surprised."
3,Home Alone Game,"I purchased this game mostly because I had it when I little and I love Nintendo memories! I remember it being hard, but I loved playing it. When I purchased this product the game worked perfectly and I found it was still very hard and I wanted to figure out how other people played it so I could get better at it and I researched it on youtube. This video is pretty corny but it might help you to decide whether you want it or not. Look up the angry nerd video game episode 38. (It wouldn't let me send the link.) There is a lot of cursing in this video also. Even though everything on that video is true, I still enjoy playing the game, maybe for sentimental reasons. I do prefer mario, or sonic though they are my favorites."
4,Rod MacDonald's 'Into the Blue',"I like this CD/album but not nearly as much as 'White Buffalo--which is great with simple music and excellent lyrics to his songs, some very humorous and clever. I do recommend this CD without qualifications...he has a great singing voice and reaches the high notes as well as anyon I know of!"
1,enough already ...,"In ""Little Games"" Jimmy Page plays some of the best guitar heard in any Yardbirds lineup, but the Mono tapes Sundazed used are so saturated with distortion the album is unlistenable. It's less expensive than the 2007 (Stereo) Japanese reissue, and that's all it has going for it.I'm a Sundazed fan, but sometimes they blow it. Maybe it's time to put a period to the era of Dinosaur Rock and let albums like ""Little Games"" go. The 2007 Japanese reissue is probably the best this album will ever sound. Sundazed's reissue is a waste of money."
3,Why the Yardbirds never lived up to the sum of the parts.,"This album, more then any other showed why the Birds never lived up to level of things to come by it members. The problem was there was always two parts of the Yardbird. First there was the core group which consisted of RELF, DREJA and McCarty. The other part was the now legendary trio of Clapton, Beck and Page. The problem was that the wrong group always seems to be in control of the musically directions. There was moments of what should of been from time to time, which included White Summer and Drinking Muddy Water on this album. However overall once again, looking back, it did not live up to what the legends did since leaving group. If it was not for Clapton/Beck/Page, whould they just be another footnote in the annual of Rock next to Savoy Brown and Chicken Shack. They are some good moments and worth the price for the diehard fans, however there was just as many, what was these guys smoking."
4,Great sound! (Skimpy pacaking),"The mono sound is crisp and tasty! You really cant get better sound than this. Call me an old geezer but I prefer this mix to the stereo. This album would have received 5 stars from me except for the fact that the packaging is bare-boned. No liner notes or booklet. If there is any faulting the material on the album it rests with producer Mickie Most who was really a ""Top 40"" guy and didnt have a firm grasp on where music was heading in 1967. But even with a couple of semi-novelty tunes the album sparkles. The current line up of The Yardbirds still perform songs from this album. Catch them in action if you can. You wont be sorry."
5,Yardbirds - 'Little Games' (Sundazed),"Twelve track CD reissue of the (sort to speak) lesser-known 1967 Yardbirds album. Has a number of what some fans refer to as Yardbirds 'deep album cuts'. Like ""Smile On Me"", the ass-kicking ""White Summer"", the tripping ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor"", the awesome ""Drinking Muddy Water"", ""No Excess Baggage"" (don't even remember this song at all) and ""Only The Black Rose"". Haven't heard most of these songs in ages. Saw that there's a Japanese import of this same title with a load of them blessed bonus cuts tacked on. I'm not ready for that CD yet - I'm still thoroughly enjoying this Sundazed edition of a vital Yardbirds catalog pick. Highly recommended."
3,Good but the weakest of their albums,"I wish that Little Games was on par with the rest of The Yardbirds discography but it's not. It not only has a weaker set of songs but the guitar work, with no disrespect to Jimmy Page, is just not as exciting or interesting. The album is less bluesy, less quirky, and just doesn't have the amazing breadth and range of songs found on their previous albums.I don't regret buying Little Games, especially to hear the live version of Dazed and Confused, which is of poor quality but is still interesting to hear. In my opinion the song Only The Black Rose is the best one on the album. I Remember The Night is a fun song, Drinking Muddy Water has the excitement of previous Yardbirds tracks, My Baby is pretty good, and White Summer is a good song.I just wish the core album was as solid as some of the other albums in their library"
5,Great Product,I'm glad I purchased these for my toddler. Much neater to pour these into individual cups than a kid smashing a paintbrush all over a tin of dry watercolor bricks. I dilute them with water and still get bright colors.
5,outstanding,"For people with medical problems that are not satisfactorily solved by standard medical procedures and phamaceuticals, this outstanding book by a highly-trained Western medical practitioner gives insights into how to develop the hope and belief to mobilize the ""inner healer""."
1,careles- no safety,make sound when it perform with 2000 W load by vibrate the coveropen inside you can see wire was copper exposed because the insulate tape (clear not black?) not in right position- careles and no safetyto return have to pay the shipping again!Why Amazon let theses products in your store?
3,Great story but a very sloppy edition,"The story is truly a classic and the translation is pretty good. However, the actual product is pretty sloppy. Volume one was less problematic than volume two, but both had a high number of instances. The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape, such as b and d, p and g, etc. get switched, almost once a page. Also, the names weren't proofread very well, as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out. In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places, this becomes a source of confusion. Also, entire words are left out pretty regularly. I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this, because most of these errors are so obvious. These errors aren't so bad that it is unreadable, but they really take a person out of the scene while the confusion is dispelled."
4,A great read...,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of my favorite novels. Unfortunately for this version, however, the story is not done much justice in its Pinyin translation. For newcomers to the series, it is quite difficult to become accustomed to it. I would recommend a Wade-Giles translation of this novel.On the plus side, this version is completely unabridged, so readers gain the full experience of one of China's great literary classics."
3,"OK translation, Kindle edition not so well made","This is an older translation; sometimes it opts for pseudo-medieval vocabulary, and as many others have noted, it uses the Wade-Giles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days. The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus, but is not available as an ebook. This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform, but the ebook, like so many of them, is quite badly made. It seems to have been scanned and run through an OCR program but not proofread properly, so that (quite aside from the Chinese names) English words come out misspelled on a regular basis. You can almost always emend the garbled reading, but it's a bit embarrassing for a once respectable publisher like Tuttle."
3,Overall i have pleasure reading it,"I enjoying reading it except the following problems:- Typos are almost appeared in every 3 pages.- Stories are not link between paragraphs. There are pages that I have to read 4-5 times in order to picture what is going on and who and who die.How about describe more about the heros when introducing them like, how old, what weapon they used and how strong. I believe those will spice up the book a lot more.EQ"
5,Bought this CD because it had a hard-to-find song on it,"Couldn't seem to find the song ""Gwendolyne"" on his other cd's. It was on this one though! :)"
4,Perfect!!,Es necesario para proteger tu Panasonic. Es un accsesorio de buena calidad. Permite llegarla de viaje o a todas partes protegiendo tu maquina de afeitar de golpes
4,Pretty good value,"I've installed this amp into a Fender speaker cabinet with an 8 ohm impedance and it works quite well. Adding another 8 ohm speaker as a slave works for awhile and then the unit goes into protect mode.The only way you know this is if the unit just stops working. As mentioned by others, there is no indicator to tell the operator the unit has shut down.Turning it off and then back on re sets until the next event.It seems the unit is not suitable for two 8 ohm speakers even though the instructions say it will work.It looks like the factory is now trying it's best to decrease the amount of air leaks in the amp. They must actually read the reviews...All and all, a good value.Installation is easy even for a non wood working talent like myself.PP"
5,"Great, Sensual, Breathtaking","As always, Catherine Coulter delivers a sensual, riveting, stunning book. Both the original Devil's Embrace and the new one are both very powerful. You'll feel things that you may not wish and things you can never forget, she brings to the reader sensuality like no other. The characters are strong and well written and the plot is very good. You may think that a book over 400 pages long will be too dragged out and boring, but when you start reading, you won't be able to put it down! Do give it a try, I promise you won't regret it!"
1,"disgusting, sick, horrifying","I'll keep this short.HOW could you like this book? It made me want to vomit! Why is it that in Ms Coulter's books, her heroines have to be beaten or raped in order to deserve love, often by the man who supposedly loves them. If that's love, and that's what it takes to be worthy, I'll pass. It just amazes me how twisted some of these romance novel authors are! If you are an avid fan of Coulter's get this one from the library, but be prepered to put it down!"
2,Shocked,"I have read other books by Catherine Coutler and I have enjoyed them.If I had known that the heroine would be raped in this book I would never have bought it. I don't know about anyone else but reading romance novels is something I occasionally do for a bit of escapism. A bit of innocent, frivolous reading purely for enjoyment. If I wanted reality there are many other subjects out there to read. I will NEVER read another romance without reading the reviews on it first. Actually it will be a long time before I pick up a romance again!"
1,Disgusting,"The worst romance noval I ever read and I read a lot. No matter if you agree with the so called hero raping the heroin, I don't expect to read about gang rape and then listen on about how the hero is getting tired of the heroin not wanting to sleep with him after such a horrible event and how he has to show her that she needs to fullfill his desire again. And I just can't get past the fact that after a brutal gang rape not two month later she not only sleeps with the so called hero but shortly after with her former fiancee. Disgusting and irresponsible. If this is Catherine Coulters favorite book I am definitely done with reading any of her books again."
1,......DISGUSTING AND A WASTE OF MONEY,"Well, I wish I had read some of the reviews here before I wasted my money. The hero is a dispassionate old lecher who decided to prove to an 18-year-old girl that he loved her by raping her. I didn't even make it to the gang rape or the adultery. Don't I feel like a silly goose. Who ever told Ms. Coulter that rape was the ""perfect"" tool of courtship should be, well, something! I mean really, if rape is your thing, who am I to quibble but they should really give a hint on the jacket or something, you know, a word to the wise, a wink and nod and I would just walk on by for pity's sake. I don't need this sort of filth ruining a romantic mood."
3,An adventure story (?),"and a clear-cut case of Stockholm Syndrome. What a nutty bunch of characters. It's not that I expect realism in fiction necessarily, but I definitely had to suspend belief to make it to the end. Yes, I understood what the story was supposed to be about, but it still made me think of ""The Collector."""
1,This book was a real disappointment,"This is the third book that I have read from Ms. Coulter and it is going to be my last. When I buy a historical romance book what I want to read about is Romance not rape. If I wanted that I just have to watch the news. Also, I do not believe that Cassandra had to have sex with Edward(her ex-boyfriend) in order to discover that she loved Anthony,it only made her feel bad and unclean. This book was not really what I was expecting."
1,Horrible book,"I couldn't finish this book. It was horrible. The heroine, Cassie, is set to marry her childhood sweetheart when she is kidnapped by the ""hero"" who wants to marry her. He then rapes her. Cassie later falls in love with this man and marries him and has his children in the end. After reading the rape scene which was so horrible I started crying, I threw the book away. Only a truly sick person would write such a thing for entertainment. I like to read love stories that make me feel happy for the characters in the book, not totally horrified. There are women out there who are victims of domestic violence; this book seems to me to justify and condone this behavior from men. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Skeeved me out,"Hero is totally stalker-psycho and the plot barely moves, an unforgivable sin in itself. I don't see why Edward gets dumped on by readers. He seemed like a real stand-up guy. Cassie was an idiot for falling for that ""Every Breath You Take"" act from Anthony.2 stars for the fact that it's a BR classic. I'm glad I read it, but I'll never want to touch it again.My longer, expletive-filled review is at my blog Get Yer Bodices Ripped Here (Google it), since the Ammy nannies won't let me post it and no amount of dashes and asterisks seems to be the correct way to get it through."
2,"I thought ""it couldn't be that bad.....""","I was right it was in fact far worse then what I had feared. It may very well be historical but there is nothing romantic about it.The contents are horrible. But what was even worse was that the guy who kidnapped her kept being presented as a hero. When he raped her the first time and took her virginity he was thoughtful, not like those other guys who gang raped her! he used lubricant.Overall-Dear God even if it is fast airport reading find something better to read."
2,So disturbing...,"I was so angry at times, especially at Anthony and Cassie. Cassie is supposed to be full of life and sassy and while she is in the beginning, I just think she ends up settling. When he was beating her, I wanted to beat the living crap out of him and she just took it. Yeah, she disobeyed him, but he kidnapped her!! I guess in his own sick way he loved her and if it weren't for the beating and the rape I could see myself liking him. But sorry, I hate these type of stories where the male treats the female HORRIBLY and then the female just forgets about it and ends up falling in love with the guy. Poor Cassie, she not only gets raped by Anthony, but she gets raped later in the story too. I just think its ridiculous for her to forgive Anthony so soon or at all. This book was just too disturbing."
1,Disgusting and Vile,"This book was an absolute disappointment. I normally like Catherine Coulter's books but this one turned my stomach. How can anyone like this book when the ""hero"" is nothing but a rapist. Just because the ""heroine"" was stupid enough to fall for her rapist does not excuse his behavior. The ""hero"" goes on through the book thinking his actions were justifiable because he loved the girl, which I find totally reprehensible. I shudder at the possibility that a man might read this vile story and actually believe that rape is o.k. if you think you love the girl. If I could have given this book zero stars I would have."
1,skip it!!!,This book literally made my stomach churn! I had nightmares after the horrible atocities that happened to the heroine. and I normally love coulter......
4,Extremely tantalizing,"Catherine Coulter's books always intrigue me. She always creates a setting realistic enough that you wish you were present during the time period. In ""Devil's Embrace"", you feel yourself being pulled into Genoa, feeling and smelling the richness of the country. The reader can't help but laugh at some points in the book, feeling what the characters feel. All in all, kudos to Ms. Coulter."
4,This was a very powerful book.,"I've read many romance novels and never did I think that thehero would never make it in time to rescue the heroine from fourhorrible villans.. The way she was tortured no one could ever recover the way she did; so, this is the only unbelievable part. That was very disturbing to read. It actually put me in a bad mood. The rest of the book was very exciting and romantic (escpecially the romantic parts, wow..)"
4,Mixed Feelings but loved the book!,"I am a huge fan of Mrs. Coulter's books, but this one is an original. I loved the characters and you could sense the enjoyment she had in creating the characters. Lord Anthony Welles raised a flag in the beginning of the book and I hated him so. I actually thought him crazy. Yet he was ""crazy"" in love with Cassie. Cassie had such spirit, spite, and pride. I still can't agree of how their love began, but I could certainly accept the fact that through slight deception she realized how she really felt about him. The love scenes were eye catching and the rape scene was disturbing. The drama in this book was honestly overwhelming at some points and yet it ended the way you want it to end. Again, I praise the author's talent in writing."
3,A little too much,"If you are looking for a different kind of historical romance, one with a lot of violence and darkness, this may be the book for you. I personally was overwhelmed by and turned off by the dark scenes and controlling characters. The main male character, the earl, was a little to brutal and full of himself for my taste. I felt no connection with him or Cassie. As for the book as a whole I honestly feel that Ms Coulter should have included a warning label with it. I certainly wished I would have been forewarned that it contained graphic violence and rape."
1,I did not like this book.,"I read a few of Coulters books, but I must say I did not like this book at all. I had no idea what this book was about. It started off good with the two main characters at each others throat. But then it went downhill from there because the heroine in the book was brutally raped by four men and to top that off Coulter was very detailed and graphic about it. I wish I would have known what the book was about because I never would have read it. The reason I read romance novels is because I want an escape one that is enjoyable, light and funny this book is just not it. Do not get me wrong it is very well written, it just was not something I enjoyed reading. So, if anyone out there is like me this book is not for you."
1,disgusted,"im usually a big fan of catherine coulters books but this book just left me speechless and disgusted. beyond what the character had to handle from the so-called hero, the rape scene just was inexcusable. i didnt and dont understand what went through coulters head when she decided to put such a brutal and descriptive gang rape--it left me nauseous and disturbed.i was, and am, incredibly disappointed in coulter for this book. honestly when i first read the scene i was waiting for the hero to come to the rescue because it was truly too unbelievably vile. i shudder that coulter made use of such a terrible topic in her novel, something that shouldnt be talked about to sell books."
3,"Remember, this was written 25 years ago.","25 years ago, this is what romance novels were. Woman were meek and young, men older and more dominant. Yes, the sex scenes were mostly glamorized rape, but it's because the woman had to appear reticent.The men were muscle bound and forceful, and the woman swooned. It was the way of the novel. The romance genre was still in diapers at the time.Like or dislike the book - but keep in mind the time period and context."
5,These Boots Are Cute!,"They aren't heavy-duty snow boots, but they are sweet looking casual boots that fit well and get compliments all the time. They fit true to size, but because the foot bed doesn't seem extra-warm, I will wear thick socks with them. I looked for along time for stylish winter boots, and I am very happy with these."
3,Very Disappointed,"I first got these boots in a size 8.5- the size of my skechers running shoes. The boots were HUGE! I sent then back- it cost $20. I got a size 8 and they are still too big in the toe area but getting tight in the width, but they are wearable. I put Dr. Schols inserts in them to take up some of the size and to make them a little more comfortable as the inside soles are quite hard as some of the reviews said. Having spent over $100 on the boots-because of shipping them back and the insoles, I don't love the boots like I had hoped I would. The way the zip stops short of the top is odd and seems to cause the top to flap open. I am thinking of sending them back for good. I was so looking forward to these boots. I have never bought shoes on line and probably won't again. It is too risky finding the right fit."
5,Perfect fit,These Sketchers are the most comfortable winter boot that i've ever bought. I needed a pair of brown ones but now i want the black ones also.
4,boots,Boots are very warm and arrived 3 days after ordering them. A little tight on the sides where you zip them up other than that great for winter!
5,great fitting boots,I have this pair for over 3 years now and up to this moment I am still using it. It still looks good. It's very comfortable and i think I would still be wearing it for a long time. It's worth the money. I got the brown one and you can definitely wear it with any color of clothes.
2,"Warm, but lace doesn't go high enough","I was really excited to get these boots. I purchased them at the beginning of the winter. The boots certainly do a good job at keeping your toes warm, but the laces do not go high enough up the leg of the boots, so if you are wearing them over your pants to avoid your pants getting soaked the top 4"" of the boots flop over and look ridiculous! If they had added just a couple more lace loops these boots would be near perfect, but to me it makes a big difference."
4,Great Winter Boots,"I love my skechers winter boots, they're warm and comfortable. I would recommend these boots for women with big calves because they're really good at adusting to calf size. My calfs aren't very big so for me, it would have been better if the laces or zipper went up higher instead of stopping 2 in short of the top. The fur lined top of the boot does tend to stick out and fold over a little since it's not held by the laces or zipper."
4,Comfortable Boots! Fits like a sneaker,"I love these boots! They not only look great but they are also super comfy! They are easy to put on and look great with a pair of skinny jeans. I have large calves and they do fit, I only wish there was a little more material around the top so there would be less gapping. Other than that these are a great pair of boots."
3,Look good but not very warm,"They look good and go well with different clothing styles. Also comfortable. However, I expected them to be warmer. My feet were still freezing when I used the boots out in extreme cold weather (~ 0*F)."
2,i was disappointed,"these are very attractive boots, and they look very comfortable but they are NOT. they are completely flat to arch support AT ALL and hard as cement. they also are not insulated in the toe AT ALL! very disappointed!!!"
4,comfy and warm,Fit is perfect and boots are warm and comfy for winter. Love the side zippers so I don't have to untie them.
5,Perfect boots,I love this boots!! If you size 7 I would recommend to go for size 6.1/2. Thank you so much ..
5,Casual and comfortable.,I already had these in black. My favorite boots to walk my son to school in. Perfect for Ohio winters!
4,Check the sizes :),"Comfortable, stylish. The toe area is roomier because it is square. The top, as others have mentioned in reviews, does flop around a little as the straps and ties are a few inches below it. The thin velcro strap at the top does sometimes come undone. I would still recommend these boots. My daughter also likes them a lot and borrows them - she said they are really comfortable and likes them a little better than her BearPaws.First pair I got was ordered as 6.5. Tried them on, they felt different on each foot.... looked inside the shaft at the size tag and one was size 6.5 and the other 7.5, they came in the 6.5 box. The price had went up after my order so there was a little bit of work involved to get the boots replaced at the same cost. Amazon's customer service was great. I returned the mismatched pair and had the new boots in a couple of days."
5,Handy Guide for Starting A Pool,"""This book shows, through informative text and colorful photos, how to install garden ponds and pools, including such decorative features as edgings, stepping stones, bridges, and lighting. It also offers instructions on how to introduce moving water, how to care for fish and plants, and how to troubleshoot problems and maintain a pool throughout the seasons."" (summary by South Texas Library System)It's so much fun to have a pool in your yard with goldfish, but there's a lot to know about setting up and caring for one. Keeping it in balance and keeping the fish healthy is well worthwhile when you get hours of enjoyment sitting by the water watching the fish. One of our fish even had babies, and some outgrew the size of pond that we had. They were relocated to a larger pond."
3,fractured ambiance,"ampbuzz-a fitting name for this project from the man behind Kinski's propulsive beauty. I think the guy's name is Chris Martin, but I could be mistaken. If you are thinking this might be a bit like Kinski, well you are wrong, however, this album does contain some kinski-esqe guitar feedback type layering, which is quite beautiful. In fact, the whole album consists of what Kinski might sound like without the basic song structure. This is ambient guitar music, reminiscent of like minded space rockers Windy and Carl and Roy Montgomery. I was listening to this album the other night before bed, I just remember one thing before falling asleep, and that was one of the songs reminded me of the Blade Runner soundtrack, it was kind of an odd feeling, I closed my eyes and hoped that no Replicants would sneak into my room during the dark dark night."
5,Super!,I picked this book up at my local Christian Book store and I am loving it very much. Every day has been in sync with my life or of a friend that God has put on my heart and had me share with those friends. More than once and more than one friend! I love this book!
5,"True ""Believer""","I received this book as a gift some 8 years ago after undergoing a grave health challenge. I continue to read it almost daily to remind me of the blessings of being gentle in spirit. I recently purchased a copy for a family member who had been going through some dificult times and needed to be at home to rest. Just after 2 weeks, I can see the difference in her demeanor/spirit. What a wonderful blessing this book has been to both of us!"
1,Dalen Landscape Fabric,Dalen Gardeneer 3-Foot by 100-Foot 5-year Weedshield Landscape Fabric #WS5100This fabric is very flimsy. It was tearing in my hand while rolling it out to get the pins in. If I pulled out a pin there were 2 big holes left behind which started to tear when straightened out.
3,Information good,"Repetitive, very academic and difficult to read. Since I need 13 more words to submit this, that is why you are getting this sentence. Stupid policy,"
5,Buy this CD!!!,"This CD is Amazing! Of all the music offered in this genre, this is quite simply the Best!!! Listening to Valarien is like going on a magical journey; prepare to be taken to an exquisite place of Peace and Beauty. I love this CD! It always lifts me up and brightens my day. And...it is also perfect for relaxation and Yoga. I give this CD the highest rating of 5 Stars! Get it, you'll be glad you did!"
3,Not really 'very' funny,"Maybe I'm just the type that doesn't get jokes, but most of the humor really wasn't too funny in my opinion. However it was most educational in the sense that the author wrote about other composers and experiences that many musicians would enjoy.I recommend this book to anyone interested in music, whether they play the piano or trumpet. There's a little bit of everything for everyone."
2,Not Very Good,"I'll keep this short. I like all of David A. McIntee other Dr. Who books, but this was just plain boring. Part of the problem is that the preceding book in the series, Unnatural History, was fabulous. The ""surprise ending"" came out of nowhere with no real reason why. It's one of those books that you ""must"" buy but wish you hadn't. Sorry, David."
3,Interesting storyline that never really pans out.,"This story could have been excellent, but fell into the category of mediocore. The plot is never truly developed and the characters are but a scetch of the true people in the story. Definitely not my favorite, but I still enjoyed reading it."
1,crushed cans,"my eight cans all arrived full of serious dents. since the shipping box was undamaged, the supplier had to have shipped the cans already dented. when i contacted the supplier about the safety of the contents of these severely dented cans, i received no response. i would not order from this supplier again."
5,Perfect guidebook,"This is the perfect guidebook. Yes, it is small and doesn't have all the info in on history or details of places, but that's what makes it so great. Fits in the back pocket and very easy to read when you're on the Metro or walking the streets. It might be a good idea to have a more detailed guidebook for history lessons on the great places in Paris, but for basic info and directions - this is the book for you..."
1,Maybe the gov't can cover up this book,"I have always been intrigued by the stories of Roswell and look forward to reading interesting and new information on the subject. This book does not meet any minumum standard of interest. The best word to describe this book is repetetive. I lost count how many times the book quotes Mac Brazel as saying ""You know how they talk of little green men?... They weren't green."" The book was a very tiresome read and for an interesting subject, never got me interested. The time line is maybe the best thing in this book. In the center has black and white photos that don't mean much or add anything. A photo of a man in profile is captioned ""Don Schmitt listens as one of the witnesses relates her story of the recovery."" WHO CARES?"
5,Charming Biography,"This enjoyable biography brings to life the story of musical prodigy Van Cliburn. The whimsical drawings accent the text and create a gentle picture of this talented concert pianist. Van Cliburn was the first American to win the prestigious Tchaikovsky competition in Russia at the height of the cold war. Although aimed at elementary school readers, all ages can enjoy this tale of talent and hard work."
4,Some amusement to get you through the trials of your day as a parent,"This book contains some very funny cartoons about the trials of parenthood. Being a parent is simultaneously the most rewarding and challenging thing that you can do. The emotions run from being so frustrated that you could chew nails to being so proud you run the risk of floating away. Through it all you have to be able to laugh at the trials that you will experience and this book will help you do that. Some of the jokes are hysterical and while they are exaggerated for effect, all are based on a great deal of truth."
1,One Big Yawn!,"This book was totally boring and childish. I think Ms. Steele wrote this book while she was sleeping. Things were repeated constantly. Boring. She sometimes threw things in as an afterthought. I think my sixth grader could have written a better story. After reading her book about the concentration camp, I was thoroughly disappointed. It will be a long time before I pick up another book by Ms. Steele. I have told many of my friends, forget this book."
2,No thank you....,"I read this book after it was given to me by a friend. I just skimmed right through this book, it had so little substance. It was boring and predictable, like so many of her novels."
3,Steel's Soap Opera or Spaghetti Western?,"Ms. Steel is attempting to change scenery or plotlines or something here--it just does not work compared to some of her other works. Granted, such a prolific authoress has her ups and downs, but her see-saw seems to be stuck on the ground.In ""The Ranch"" we meet Mary, Tanya, and Zoe. Lifetime friends who reunite at a dude ranch in Colorado. It is here they reveal secrets, make amends and share their lives and loves.Not a bad book, just not a good one.other reading suggestions"" ""The Ghost"" by Danielle Steel and ""Grand Passion"" by Jayne KrentzThanks for your interest & comment vote--CDS"
4,GOOD BOOK BUT IT ENDED TOO SOON...,"I've liked Danielle Steel for some time now. When I stumbled upon ""The Ranch"" I thought that it was going to be a book about friendship mostly, and it was, but also new loves, and betrayal. It's a very good book and the ending is quite unexcpected!"
4,Good,It was a realy good book i think but it could end differently. Stu should marry the authour and we should hear more about Zoe.
2,disappointed,"While this is not the worst book I've ever read, I was very disappointed!! I've read almost all of Danielle Steel's books, and this is the most boring of them all!!!"
1,Really disapointed,So bad that I could not finish it.Had to force my self to get more than halfway but then I just gave up. There is nothing in that book to hold one interest.Have told friend Dont bother to read it. It is a waste of time.
1,Terrible and disappointing!,I usually read Danielle Steele's books and like them. This one was slow and unrealistic. I didn't enjoy it at all. Danielle needs to get it together
2,Disappointing Steel,"A book that is filled with cliches. In the last few books, it has seemed to me that Ms. Steel is just trying to crank them out as fast as she can to make more money. It was so predictable that even I could have written it. The ending was somewhat a surprise but follows what normally happens, happy endings for everyone"
1,oh good lord,"At times, I was actually embarrassed to be reading this book. But I got it at a used book sale for $1, and I think I got my money's worth! Yes, Ms. Steel needs a better editor for her commas and run on sentences and mindless repetition. And by the way, I had to check 5 times to see what year this book was written. Pink jeans? Turquoise boots? In 1997?"
2,Predictable,"Are you dying of a terrible disease? Are you thinking about leaving your husband? Are you being sued? Then don't worry. All you need to do is visit Wyoming for 2 weeks & you're guaranteed to find true love within 3 days (give or take a day). There are three heriones in this story, all in their forties, and according to the author (who tells us every few minutes), they're ""gorgeous,"" ""sexy,"" ""sensational,"" ""lovely,""""stunning,"" and haven't changed since college 20 years earlier. It got distracting hearing about what these Vogue models were wearing. Reminded me of how a Nancy Drew book is written."
4,"Friendship, romance and solutions",I thought this was a great Danielle Steel book. It is my 20th by this author and I loved it! The book focuses on three college friends living very different lifestyles. They keep in touch over the years (except for two that had a falling out) and have a reunion at a ranch. Their lives each have their own problems but their friendship continues! It was also romantic with the men in their lives but not gushy romance. Some of Danielle Steel's books make me really cry but this one had more happiness to it! Bittersweet ending also!
2,it could have been better,"the beginning wasn't that great, it got a little better at the end, but i think it should have ended differently."
1,Worthless book,"This book was boring, the plot wandered from character to character, and the writing was terrible. Need I say more? With so many good books available to read, why do so many people continue to buy Danielle Steel's books? I have read other books of hers, but this was definitely one of the worst! Her writing is formulaic and predictable. I will try never to read one of her books again."
3,good story,"The story idea was good but no doctor who treats AIDS patient would say ""I have AIDS"" after a simple blood test - she would say ""I am HIV positive"". Also, and this is true of all her books, she overuses ""and"" and even begins sentences with it!!!! Please leave out all of the unnecessary ""ands""!"
2,It could have been better!,"Usually I can get into a Danielle Steele novel so much, that I am unable to put it down. ""The Ranch"" really wasn't one of those novels. I thought the story dragged on too much and it was extremely boring. It took me almost 2-months to finish this book. My daughter actually told me, ""Gosh mom, you usually can finish a Danielle Steele book in 3-days"". I was actually surprised at her comment; but, it's true. Sorry Danielle!!"
1,Poor Grammar. Whinny rich Girls,"Poor grammar. Cannot take the cry babies of the rich girls; as if they have any problems to cry about in their lives. As a working girl I cannot stand rich girls/women feeling sorry for themselves, when they have no problems as do the poor working girls."
2,Maybe you'll have better luck than I,This went hay wire after a few months of use. The batteries were expensive also. I don't recommend this product but maybe I just got a faulty one. The control features were nice.
3,Worked on and off...,"We used to have a sport dog collar, actually looked exactly like this one...I think it was the older version of this one. Lasted almost 2 years, so I figured I'd get another. It's a great collar, however, it would work on and off, even after being fully charged. Thankfully we were within the 30 day return period. We returned it with no problems or questions asked and got a full refund, including tax. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. Going w a TriTronics next. We have 2 dogs...for the same price to get 2 of these, we get a better quality one and only have one remote to control both collars."
3,Great Product BUT...,Product is well constructed. have not had opportunity to put to test the immerseable claim. although my dog did get it wet while playing in his water dish with no [problems. Product offers a wide range of options in the area of application and sensitivity. Only went as high as four (4) once. Two(2)is what I use when I have to use it. Great training material included. One should definetly read this material BEFORE using product.The training material could probably be packaged and sold alone. Have not had need to call customer service so I can not offer an informed opinion there. One (1) thing keeps me from giving this product five (5) stars: RANGE. Or should I say the lack of range. Unobstructed level clear open terrain--- 25yds MAX. If that far. Far far far shorter than mfg claims.If range is not a major concern this product should serve you well for a loonngg time.
2,"Worked okay at first, but now disappointed in the product","I purchased this collar based upon reading the positive reviews left by other Amazon purchasers.At first this collar worked fine, but over the span of a few weeks the performance appears to have been seriously degraded. Even with a full charge, the max range on the collar is less than 25 yards. This obviously is no where near the advertised range of 400 yards.The collar/remote design is nice, but this is a mute point because the thing does not work as advertised.Based upon the recommendation of a professional dog trainer, I have ordered a tritronics unit. My only regret is I should have ordered the tritronics first instead of purchasing the sport dog"
1,not recommended for adverse environments,"I bought this product for a Great Pyrenees, that weighs over 175 lbs. The product worked great for about two weeks, we took it off and recharged it and it lost its programming or something and now does not work. I have tried to reprogram it and it does not take. It is now 45 days after purchase and I just wasted 170.00 dollars. So the dog gets to go back on the leash or in the kennel, so the cat does not get eaten. I thought spend some money, get a good one, and everything would be great. Its not, its junk."
3,Petsafe Sportdog Field Trainer,This is the second petsafe sportdog field trainer i have bought. I would highly recommend using this training tool to train dogs. However i have been disappointed with the quality of the products. My first one stopped working because the screws rusted and expanded causing cracks in the plastic and hence water filtered in when we took our dog to the beach. This happened even though we religously rinsed it after our dog swam with it at the beach as advised in the manual. We had no warranty because it was purchased overseas through amazon. Our second one is only a few weeks old and is faulty so we have had to send it away at a cost of $65 to be repaired. We have spent so much money on this product. I would recommend paying a bit more and purchasing it through a store in your country where you can be guaranteed a warranty. We might have had some bad luck but i think it is better to be safe than sorry and out of pocket!
1,Not Good for dogs with thick fur.,"I purchased this for my sheltie and either it is totally defective, not sure how to tell without trying it on my hand which I am not inclined to do, or it simply does not get through his thick fur, the contacts are pretty short and stubby. It was suggested that I shave his neck, but he is a sheltie, known for his thick, luxurious fur and great lion-like main, why should I have to shave his neck?Dont really know whether it works or not, but it does not work on my sheltie."
5,FieldTrainer SD-400s by SportDog,We purchased this item in hope we could calm down our English Lab. It worked! What a change in his behavior. Even though he is still in training we are able to have him outside with us. When that collar comes on and hears the beeps He obeys our commands. He sits outside with me and doesn't bark at anyone walking by. What a change in him. I'm so proud of Jake. He is a dog worth having. Thank you!
3,Poor battery life,I purchased this collar for my Saint Bernard last year. My yard cannot be fenced for a variety of reasons and I wanted her to be able to run in the woods behind my home. Although I found the 12 hour charge time annoying the collar worked well.After nearly a year I find the collar does not hold its charge very long. when I first had the collar it would hold a charge for about 2 days. It now only holds a charge for about 12 hours.
4,Field Trainer,"Our willful girl is only the 2nd dog we've ever owned who required more than voice commands for training, and this is the 2nd ""trainer"" we've ever owned. This set has better range than the one we owned previously. In the month since we've purchased it we've used the ""zap"" feature at level 2 exactly one time. We always give a voice command first, followed by the tone if needed. The only negative we've experienced is the ease of use. The buckle system works, but positioning can be troublesome."
4,Sportdog Field Trainer is Worth the Cost,"This product has worked great. I was a little scared to spend the money on this product because I did not know if it would work, but it does. The first day it took some getting used to-me and the dog. After that I can take him out without a leash no problem. DO WATCH THE VIDEO FIRST OR THE COLLAR WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Tested on one of the most stubborn dogs I've ever seen - a German Shorthair Pointer. The battery life is good (I usually recharge the batteries after 1 1/2 - 2 hours training session). Also, the claim that the collar and remote are waterproof is true. I have not tested the collar over 100m, as this was not my training objective, but I can confirm that at this range it works fine (usually I avoid allowing the dog getting more than 40 m away... as I train the dog for pheasants and quail shooting).Something else - I was initially afraid to let the dog running with the collar attached in dense bush (due to the suffocation risk) but if you attach the collar is tight, there is little to be concerned of...Ahh.. Last, but not least: this is the first time I use such device, and it really simple to get around. Soon I guess I will put away the collar as the dog already behaves."
3,stopped working; company replaced it,"I bought the sd-400 for a dog who had started chasing cattle. Even for cattle and deer chasing, the lowest levels were plenty--I can't imagine needing the ""stubborn"" trainer. A couple warnings: the transmitter doesn't transmit very far; 1/4 mile is only in perfect conditions. 100 yards is more like it. After several months, the unit stopped working. The manufacturer talked me through some steps that didn't work, and then they offered to send a new replacement. At that point, I opted to pay a little more and get the sd-800, which transmits over 1/2 mile. This is a much better unit, and worth the extra $20 or so. Before you use any remote trainer, make sure you work with a good trainer, or at least carefully read the directions and watch the video. It's easy to destroy your relationship with your dog, but if you use the e-collar carefully, it can be a great tool for working with your dog in a positive manner."
3,If you're feeling sinister..,"I just found out that Rasputina covered Belle & Sebastian's ""Fox In The Snow,"" so I downloaded it. I have to say the original is better, considering the vocals on the cover version are a little strained, especially during those high notes, but it could have been their intention to go a little over the top while covering what could be considered precocious material. In any case, I still like what I've heard, I respect the artists they've chosen to cover and I'd reccomend picking up the disc."
4,I wonder...,"This is a great toy, but i have seen this exact mold for an Optimus Prime before.... hmmm..... ah well I know this is not the first time a mold has been used twice!"
4,An exellent toy...,"I have the Laser Rod Prime of old, even with the removal of the light up gimmick (Quick trip to Radio Shack can fix that by the way ;) ) Scourge is an excellent toy, the paint job really enhances the look of this mold, which is already incredible.I highly recommend this figure...."
3,A fun read.,"An entertaining mix of action, steamy sensuality, and elements of of intrigue, as Slocum tries to get to the bottom of a possible swindle. Those who are long-time readers of this series will probably not be disappointed! 5.5hrs"
2,Your average movie licensed game,"Home Alone for Genesis was beyond great, but this NES version is horrible.You play as Kevin, and you must avoid getting caught by the Wet Bandits for 20 minutes. You just run around the house setting traps on them.Going up/down the stairs is a chore, since you must be in a precise spot to do so.The traps look like TV screens. TV screens...not the TV itself.The characters look weird. Kevin's walking animation is awkward, and the Wet Bandits don't look like themselves.At least the music changes. Once you are outside the house, the music changes. The music switches back once you're back inside.If you get caught, the game is automatically over. No lives, no nothing.So don't bother purchasing this unless you're a collector and/or you want to play bad games."
3,Back Cover Description,"MEN INTO SPACE is the thrilling story of man's gradual conquest of outer space. Starting with the rockets of today, the story moves on to trace the development of the Space Platform and spaceships. It concludes with the first successful attempts to land on the Moon... Mars... and points beyond."
3,Great Vintage Views of Classic Steam Locomotives,"The three DVD's that comprise this collection are available separately, but save your money and buy all three together in this collection. Great footage of classic steam trains (most shot on 16mm film) are assembled with sounds of steam to produce a treat for steam locomotive fans. Great shots of mammoth Big Boys, Norfolk and Western Y and A class articulateds, and even the Goliath Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Yellowstones hauling everything including coal, iron ore and farm implements. DVD transfer quality is pedestrian but clean."
4,Excellent Collection of Vintage Steam at an Affordable Price,"This set contains 3 DVDs: 'Steam Giants Across America', '50's and 60's' and 'Twilight of Steam'. 'Steam Giants Across America' covers steam action mainly with UP BigBoys and Challengers. All color 16mm footage with some footage from vintage UP promotional films. '50's and 60's' covers classic railroads and excursion steam. Last, but not least, 'Twilight of Steam' covers Norfolk and Western Steam in it's last days as well as other railroads and their massive engines. There is no duplicate footage among the 3 DVDs and they are all color, mostly 16mm and some standard video of the more recent excursion trains. No annoying banjo music either, so you can listen to the sounds of steam without any interruption. The 'bonus' material is not much of a bonus, just a few paragraphs on some famous trains and robberies. The trivia is worth ignoring."
5,"beautiful, meditative, similar to baraka","i'm really glad i own this -- it reminds me a lot ofBarakain that it's much more of an experiential movie than the typical documentary. there's a lot of spectacular cinematography of india just with music, or the ambient sounds of the environment. it makes me feel like i'm a silent observer in the room, rather than being the recipient of a story being told AT me. i love putting this dvd on when i'm feeling blue, or need to quiet down. moving, powerful, and makes me long to go to india."
4,DVD - Spirituality,"""Darshan"" is much more than an overview of who & what the Divne Mother / Avatar Amachi is; it is also an experience of India - much more real than ""Mystic India""."
2,Needed a little more...,"This kind of film really needed some level of narration. Most of it is just random scenes of Amma or buildings, or streets, without any real context. It's good to see Amma and you do hear some of her verbal teachings and a few words from her devotees, but that's about it."
2,Beautiful sentiment-poor quality,"The hugging saint is an inspiration, but the video was made by someone who doesn't know how to tell a story, using the medium of film. It's bad enough to keep the experience of watching her from being enjoyable. Very sorry to say."
2,active noise cancellation all but non-existant,"This pair was OK for comfort and sound quality. But it's marketed as an active noise-cancellation product, and as such it fails miserably. I am familiar with this type of product, and I know what performance expectation can be considered reasonable. I cannot recommend this, because if you DO NOT need a noise-cancellation feature, there are products that are more comfortable to wear and don't have a battery box. If you DO want this feature, you won't get it with this item."
2,Iluv I900,"the Iluv i900 is comfortable and an effective noise cancelling set of ear buds, I enjoy using them.Sadly they don't last.I liked the first set I bought so much when they failed I bought a second set they failed even sooner both within a few weeks."
4,Good work again in IBIZA,"Here a new session from Nacho Sotomayor (the king of ibiza).You can find traks of Sotomayor friend's like : Cloudfish, Luis Junior,Tabula Rasa, Jungle Brothers (a rap song!),Esthero(what a sweet song),Tanya Michelle, Xperimental, Agent 5.1.It's a chillout collection well done, but the N1 was better, more fresh and trance (more aggresive)The general ambient of this cd it's the relax, with acoustic and electronic sound and beautiful voices (more female).Don't forget (if you love Nacho music) to listen all the LA ROCA (they arrived at N5!!!)"
5,Starkness is the Greater Substance,"THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW is strange filmmaking indeed. This Western film noir, directed by Andre De Toth, is curious stuff. THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW seems like a cross between directors' Sam Fuller and William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman ventures into the Western film genre. Robert Ryan is pitted against the evil Burl Ives in this cold and stark black and white production. That vision of starkness is the greater substance and very effective essence of this outstanding film. An interesting score from Alexander Courage and Russell Harlan's cinematography are very effective here."
3,Catwoman PC Game,Not in very good condition when I received it. The game is very complicated to play with the PC keys and is suited better for teenage/adult ages.
5,Beautiful,"This paper is beautiful! Looks just like what I saw online. Good quality as well. I used it for a birthday party decoration (mermaid party) and loved the quality, size and picture! Would recommend to anyone who wants a realistic water ""view"" and has a flat surface in which to affix it."
3,Bought 3 of these,"super comfortable at first, after a few weeks the padding lost it's strength and now the chairs are not anywhere near as comfortable as they were. Not a bad buy at all though. They are still great chairs, but not as great as when they first arrived."
1,"Waste of time, except for the ATS part","I spent over two months preparing for the LAST and ATS-W using this book. On test day, I found out that it was basically a waste of time. The practice tests in this book are not at all like the actually LAST. The practice ATS-W qustions are a little closer. The LAST is a reading comprehension test, so you really can't study for it. It is probably best just to get the $5 study guides when you register for the exam so that you are familiar with the structure of the test and questions. After that I recommend getting a good night's sleep and making sure that you give yourself enough time to do the multiple choice questions and essay - four hours seems like a lot of time, but it goes by quickly, especially since the reading passages are long and then only ask you one question (it gets really exhausting).Also, beware, this book has more than a few errors."
2,"LAST OK, but ATS-W far off base","I just took the LAST exam and used this book as a review. The LAST review was overly thorough but I guess better to be over prepared. The LAST is just reading comprehension. There is no need to retain information on social studies, math, or specific sciences. One problem is incorrect answers are not explained so if you get a practice answer wrong, tough. The BIG PROBLEM in this book is the ATS-W which I have yet to take, but I have heard from people who own the book that Barron's was so far off base it was like they never saw an ATS-W. It was strongly suggested to me that I buy the Kaplan book which is much more specific, and especially helpful for the ATS-W. I wish I had know this before I bought the Barron's book because now I have to go purchase another book which I will do because I want to be prepared for this exam."
2,Waste of Money,"I don't know if the test has changed. I just took it two days ago, and the many hours of studying I did with the Barron's preparation book did not help one bit. The book emphasizes how important a thorough review of the subject matter is, but, in fact, the test is more about common knowledge and common sense than anything else. I think I would have been just as prepared without the book than with it. The only useful thing in it was the introduction, which explained how the test is scored, rated, etc. and the back of the book with addresses. I think this book needs to be reviewed thoroughly and changed to better reflect the actual tests."
1,Stick with the NYS Preparation Guides,The Barron's LAST and ATS-W book was not at all helpful in preparing for the exams. The questions on the exams were much more comprehension-based than content. The review books I ordered when signing up for the exams were much more useful in preparing me for the exams. Stick with those!
3,Beware of wrong answers!,"This book is well worth the money spent - but beware of mistakes in the answer keys! One blatant error is on an art related question. There are five possible answers (a-e) but only four options (a-d). (e) is clearly the right answer, the written explanation even says so!!!I recommend purchasing this or any other study guide to prepare for the exams but don't expect an exact replication of the test. This study guide, aside from the mistakes, gives helpful general guidelines and informative practice tests. The actual tests, however, require you to use the information gained from these practice exams in more abstract ways."
3,"A decent textbook, not for the casual reader","Though I found some of the essays exteremely interesting and helpful in my studies (this was the textbook for a southern music class), other essays were just a waste of my time. The book and class did give me a different perspective of my southern heritiage and helped me understand southern slavery, poverty, and renewal after the civil rights movement."
2,Don't look behind the curtain,"I've been playing guitar for many yeas and am fairly advanced, but am just really getting in to fingerstyle. I saw this book and had to get it. ""Wizard"" tunes are instantly recognizable the world over and a sure crowd pleaser. But I was left a bit disappointed with Hanson's arrangements. With a few exceptions, they are too straightforward and aren't as warm as I'd like them to be. There is a lot of space left in some of the arrangements that can leave the listener feeling flat. The author states in the preface that he only had a few weeks to arrange and record everything; I think he would have benefitted from some more time to let the arrangements really come together and to give these treasures the care they deserve."
3,Really fun but not a workout!,"This video was loads of fun. The choreography was funky and the class was enjoyable. The only problem was it was way too easy! If you're looking for a fun, short dance class this is great, but if you're looking for a challenging cardio workout forget about this video! Still, I will use this if I need an energy boost and am too tired to do something harder. This is good if you're in a bad mood or need to wake yourself up!"
2,"Good workout, but very tricky to master","When beginning this workout, I found the hip hop moves very difficult to master. For the first set of steps, I had to rewind a few times to get the foot work right. After the first few difficult minutes, the rest of the video is pretty much impossible. I found my self rewinding too many times and still not being able to keep up. Now when working out to this, I basically stay within the first two portions and rewind again. The instructors were very upbeat and enjoyable to watch, but impossible to follow."
4,Fun Workout!,"This tape is not one that a beginning exerciser would appreciate. It may not even be a tape that an advanced exerciser would appreciate. But, I love it! It is run like a dance class. The steps are taught slowly and then they take them up to tempo. They are challenging, yet fun and funky. The biggest problem is the camera man doesn't focus on their feet when you really need him to! I was lost for a moment or two, but it repeats enough that it is easy to get back on track."
3,WE Love Lucy,"It's always great to read about the behind the scenes of the I Love Lucy show...I knew most of what I read already, but REALLY enjoyed the photos from the author's collection."
4,Great look at being a woman writer in the early days of television,"Great autobiography by Madelyn Pugh, who along with Bob Carroll Jr, wrote most of the I Love Lucy tv shows and worked with Ball on her other series. The book focuses on what it was like to be a woman writer in the early days and by the time Pugh and Carroll were producers on Alice, how many women were involved. Of course there are numerous stories about Lucy and working on the I Love Lucy show. A great book for any fan of Lucy as well as the early days of television."
2,Not a good introduction to CGI,"I bought this book because the Amazon reviewers loved it so much. I got about 150 pages into it and now I need to buy a different book. This book is good for people who really really like to learn by rote. The authors cover interesting and important topics, but they don't explain them well. They don't even try to outline the purpose of a script before coding it. They also introduce functions that are new to the reader somewhere in the middle of a script. They never write, ""This is function x. It can be used like this... Here is an example....""They just start coding without any introduction except for some stupid jokes.That said, if you already know a buttload of Perl and DBI and CGI programming, you might like this book for the examples.Also, there were way too many errors in the text and the code, and that makes it even harder to learn."
4,Replacement tires,It was time to replace the tires on my Trek FX 7.7 and I was tired of flats - These Tires ride smooth - we will see how it goes
5,Hard to beat,"These tires are tough, last lots of miles, give a good ride, and somewhat thorn resistant. I have used them on seversl bikes for several years."
2,A flat every week,"I have been riding on these tires for the past year (all four seasons). They perform well as a commuter tire (700 X 28) with excellent traction in all kinds of weather and varied terrain. The main problem I have with these tires is their tendency to get punctures. I have had a flat on average about twice a month! (I ride about 120 km per week on mixed terrain: paved bike trails and city streets in DC). At first I thought it was a pressure issue (I am a mountain biker and was inflating the tires to 80-90 psi. After correcting this and keeping tires inflated to 116 psi (the max for this tire) and checking twice a week, I continued to get punctures. This always resulted from shards of glass slicing right through the tire. A great disappointment, as I was looking for puncture resistance as a main feature. I should say that it is ALWAYS the rear tire that gets flats...perhaps I should switch the tires to see if that helps."
1,Another sidewall failure. Believe the reviews,"I have only been using these for a few months(700-23 on my good rode bike). I started getting worried because I saw some sidewall fraying but I thought it was only cosmetic. Today I'm out 20 miles from home and get a huge blowout. Sidewall split about 1 in long, right along the edge of the reinforcement. That is unacceptable for a $60 tire only a few months old. You expect way more from Conti. Now I can't trust this brand. And I need 2 new tires. Don't do it, even though you think they're good, I suspect it some kind of quality problem and it's not worth the risk. My cheap Kenda's last longer on my commuter."
2,Sidewall FAILURE after a month,"I bought this tire a little over a month ago. I only got about 400 miles out of the rear before the sidewall blew out. Tire is trash.VERY DISAPPOINTING and a pain to deal with after forking over all that money.Before this unfortunate end to the rear tire, I REALLY enjoyed these tires and will continue to ride the front. However, I will not ever use this as a rear tire again. With the exception of sidewalls, these tires are very durable and ride really nice. I was riding bontrager Hardcase before this and liked these alot better. However, the bontys never had sidewall issues a year, let alone a month in."
5,Great All Season Tire,"This is my go-to tire for my winter training. I use the 700x25c size clincher on my road bike. These have a bit more grip for the wet roads and leaves I encounter than the Conti 4000s I use for summer, and I have had only one flat in 1000 miles on a pair of these. Slightly more rolling resistance than race tires some say, but I'm not sensitive enough to notice much difference. My commuter bike also has a pair mounted in the 700x28c size and they have been trouble free for the last year."
3,they're ok,"My 3 year old loves them but they are not worth the price, they are not as realistic looking as the bigger dinosaurs. Quite frankly they are cheap looking and I would have returned them if my son hadn't seen them. However he plays with them a lot and says he loves his new little dinosaurs."
3,Dragonchaser,"This disk follows much along the same lines as their previous release (Heart of Steel). It's got a few solid Malmsteen-inspired rockers, a ballad or two, a couple neo-classical instrumentals & an Abba cover. Nothing too earthshaking on this cd, but not a bad effort. I would definitely reccomend Heart of Steel over this disk. Both can be found much cheaper with a little searching..."
2,mediocre,"Abba and classic covers are good, however the song writing on their own songs is surprisingly weak for such experienced musicians. Get Only Human instead of this it's way better."
3,brilliant account of history,This book captured me from start to finish. The huge amount of history and knowledge leads to euphoria to the history lover.
5,Viva La Diva!,"The ever divine Caballe at her very best. A wonderful Norma and an intimate recital all on one disc it is a must have not just for fans of La Superba but for anyone who wants to know what thrilling singing is all about. In her prime Caballe demonstrates why she was perhaps the greatest lyrico spinto soprano of the last century. Her effortless legato, heavenly pianissimo's, unequalled breath control and a rare musicality combine to give the listener a most thrilling experience. Buy it immediately and enjoy it forever. Brava Montserrat!!!"
1,dont buy,"dont buy this game . its not funn. the questions are all the same for each catagory . if you whant to buy a good nes game, buy kirbys adventure"
5,A thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.,This is an excellent performing group. I have been a professional musician myself and can appreciate the level of excellence.
5,Excellent Music,"Max Raabe & The Palast Ochestra make excellent music on this set of well-produced discs. They are well-trained musicians - including Raabe and some other with a background in opera. As stated in the album notes and elsewhere, their roots include the Comedian Harmonists. Enjoy!"
5,Enjoying every track!,"Max Raabe and his Palast Orchester have so much going for them. I particularly love the German tracks on this DVD and if you like it, be sure and purchase the other DVD he did in an outdoor setting in Berlin a couple of years ago. Here he speaks entirely in German to the audience and you get English subtitles for the introductions to the songs and the songs themselves. Don't miss this group in concert when they're in America again!"
1,Cover versions?,"Any amateur of Duo Duo's poetry will notice at first glance that many of the titles and and even more of the lines of this collection of Duo Duo's poems betray a remarkable resemblance to those in a previous anthology translated by Gregory Lee and John Cayley, ""Looking Out From Death"" published by Bloomsbury in 1989. A number of translations, in particular that of ""I've always delighted in a shaft of light in the depth of night"", also resemble Lee's tranlations in The Manhattan Review, translations which antedate Robinson's book. The provenance of translations into English are notoriously difficult to police. However, this book fulfilled the function of making available Duo Duo's poetry in English translation once the Bloomsbury book was out of print..."
3,Jeep driving commando clone,"It originated in the arcades, and this game forced people to pump in quarters, but at home it challenged people with limited lives and continues. Basically this is a top view shooter like the Commando video game, only you drive in jeeps. You shoot, throw grenades, pick up POWs and transport them to helipads. All while avoiding bullets, soldiers, vehicles and crazy boss fights.The jeeps can only shoot north and throw grenades every which way. Much like how Commando could only throw a grenade north and shoot every which way.Its worth a play and it is a classic, just expect to die a lot, but at least its not costing you quarters."
4,The Oregan Trail,This dvd was purchased for the purpose of illustrating early American culture to Chinese students and was satisfactory for the purpose. The story and time segmentation of the dvd was most helpful with the longest segment about 50 minutes.
3,Oregon Trail,This is an average documentary that helps give students a visual addition to the history of the Oregon trail. I was disappointed that the day I showed it was on sale for a third the cost at BI mart.
1,I like history,"I was looking forward to watching this because I like history and history movies are usually cool.You get photos. I mean I know they couldn't record anything back then, but they could have hired actors.A boring person narrarates while picture fill up the screen.I left after about 2 min."
3,when is it classic and when is it stale?,I didn't enjoy this cd as much as I expected. Guess it's all in the ears of the reviewer. I had heard too much like it before and it wasn't strong enough as a classic to hold my interest.
4,Big and heavy!,"This is cool. Pin-Up never seen like this before! It does have A LOT of info and the images are neatly printed on the pages, not like other pin-up books I've bought. These pin-up girls seem more mature than I thought. More like pin up women! lol..."
4,Great American Pin-Up Review,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Great American Pin-Up"" because there is finally a book that documents the history of pin-up artwork. The images are brilliant and beautiful and the brief histories of the artist provide a look into their work. The only thing i'd change about this would be to add the titles of the individual peices of art. Other than that, the book was wonderfully written and composed."
5,"the million dollar car & $250,000 Pizza","an ideal book to help just about any reader understand thefinancial consequeces of how each dollar spent today impacts yourfinancial health tomorrow. Ms Lewis doesn't say you can't have fun, but rather do it within your means and reap the rewards of your self dicipline to insure your financial future. Not only informative but fun to read as well."
3,Just OK...,"I think the highlight of this book was the idea of coming up with a written financial plan and a family financial mission statement. The book also makes it clear that our financial choices are what can make or break our plans. The book correctly states that the less money you earn, the more urgent the need for good planning. Lower income people can't count on a big paycheck to bail themselves out of poor financial decisions.I rate the book a ""3"" because it wasn't as coherent, simple and entertaining as my four current favorites in the financial planning genre: ""Richest Man in Babylon"", ""Neatest Little Guide to Personal Finance"", ""Getting Rich in America"" or ""Wealth in a Decade"". All the same, its worth the time to browse through it."
1,Horrible Service,"I do not know who the owner of this page is, but they are not people I will deal with ever again. Make sure you read ALL the reviews and take them all in to consideration. I bought an amp from this person for $600, and the bank took the money and payed this person. The very next day, my order was canceled and they reposted the amp I attemped to buy for $850. I have been watching this amp for about 4 months prior to the purchase and they have had plenty of time to change the price if that is what they wanted. I also emailed them about the situation and almost a month and a half later, I still have no respose. Good luck buying from this person."
1,This one sucks,"First let me say what a really GREAT album Blinker the Star - Burgeois Kitten is. However this CD, ""their( really just Jordan) 1st effort is a real boring, noise -filled, totally un melodic bomb. It deserves no more of my time. Someday I'll write an in-depth 5-star review for Burgeois Kitten. Don't buy this first CD, though."
1,Bad Experience,"Sooo. Company coming, Need to make dessert ahead of time. A cranberry almond butter cake. Very thick batter. About $15 worth of ingredients. Mixed it up, scraped it into the brand new pan, and into the oven it went. 3-4 minutes later I hear a sizzling sound. It was leaking all over the oven! Whoever said these don't leak must have bought an older, better quality version. This one leaks like a sieve right under the buckle. And yes, I made sure it was properly fitted and closed. After I cleaned up the mess I washed and dried the pan and began trying to figure out why it leaked. No matter what I did, it would lose water in the same place time after time. Boo. Should have known there's no such thing as a ""bargain."""
3,It's just one.,"Please, if it's just one pan what you sell, you should put a single pan in the picture. I bought this thinking it was a set of 4."
3,only one,even though 3 of them are pictured you get only one.the one you get is as pictured. They should only show a picture of one of them.
1,Really confusing ads. picture,"When I shopping for this item, I thought they are four instead of one set and from the pictures. I think this is a cheating picture and I am fooled!"
5,furious-rocknroll!,"Hell yeah, awesome. since 1st time i saw its cover i know its gonna be a gnarly tunes in pounding my ear drum. fast tracks with angry n unholy vox sure to keeps yer head banging. hell yeah! buy this alb n give yer ears pleasure. aw....rock it up!nb: play with high volume..."
3,Good product,Good purchase. Nice to be able to turn the light on and off. Buttons are big and easy to press. Easy to install.I wish the buttons were lit up to see in the dark.
5,Wall Console Garage Door Opener,I ordered this item to lock my garage DOOR just like any other door in my home. The doorbell that came with my opener just did not have this option. As the option stated in the manual it works just as it states and was very easy to install no problems.
5,ADG Pistol Case,"The ADG Pistol Case I purchased is GREAT , only problem was it takes a little fiddiling to lock and unlock , shipping was very fast."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC!! Don't be fooled by the ""aluminum"" description, only the corners were aluminum, the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC. The case came poorly packaged! The box was too small for the case. The case had scuff marks, and scratches on it. Obviously NOT BRAND NEW!! This was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon. Will never buy ADG SPORTS again!!! Their label was crooked on the case too!! Looks like a 4-year-old put it on!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! TRUST ME!!!"
2,The Locks Don't Work,"This looked like a wonderful little gun case that I wanted to use to ship two hand guns from Ohio to Texas. It met the TSA requirement of being hard shelled but it proved impossible to lock. I returned one because of the fault, and the replacement case suffered from the same problem."
2,Nice Case But,"Beautiful case and just what I was looking for. The only problem was that the locks did not work, so I have returned the case."
1,NOT ALUMINUM,THIS CASE IS CHINESE CRAP ITS ALSO FALSE ADVERTISING BY AMAZON IT IS NOT ALUMINUM IT IS CHEAP PLASTIC YOU CAN CUT WITH A KNIFE IT IS NOT A SECURE GUN CASE.THE LOCKS ARE JUNK THE KEY BENT TRYING TO LOCK IT IM SENDING IT BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!BUY AMERICAN !!!!!!!!!
3,works and price is right,"does what it should do. guns slide when case is vertical, but is ok for purpose. Lock is fine, works well"
3,Aluminum Gun Case,"Decent Plastic PVC case, the ""Aluminum Gun Case"" description is mis-leading. Not a bad product though for the money, decent locks"
5,Great case for iPad,"I was looking for a secure case for my iPad for when I am in the hospital or other public place. This does the job about as good as anything else I've found. Only problem is it won't stop someone stealing the whole case and cracking it open when they get home. But nothing will solve that problem other than chaining it to my bed or in a cabinet. I'm trying to figure out how to add a steel cable or chain to do that. Space-wise it holds my iPad, iPhone, Kindle, and the chargers. So I'm a step closer to mobile security."
3,Could Be Better,I like the case size and the materials used are okay but the production was seriously lacking. One side of the case sticks due to sloppy glue application. I had to get glue remover to take off some of the excess glue just to make opening the case less paindful. I would have given it 4 stars if I didn't have to do work to make it function.
1,sad,"This game is not good. I remember playing this game when I was younger, so I recently ordered it. It's terible. first of all, the doors that make a loud thump sound over and over ever time you open and close them. second, he jumps stupid so you will fall alot. ..."
3,ONE SIDED,"COLORS ARE SO PRETTY; DIE-CUT EDGES ARE VERY SHARP. OVERPRICED, THOUGH, SINCE ONE SIDE IS BLANK. COLORS HANDLE SUN EXPOSURE WELL."
4,holds up well,"I got this 4 months ago and it's holding up well. Its not big and gaudy and is a nice size. My only complaint would be that the colors should be brighter, they are kind of dark."
4,finding thorny truths beneath trivia,"Must confess to having purchased and read only the original book published in 1997, the year I departed from the legal profession. What struck me was not the best judicial opinions but the ones the author found to be worst. Among them, Hawaii Supreme Court Associate Justice Steven Levinson's opinion in Baehr v. Lewin. Baehr is a most disgusting example of judicial legislation, an unabashed attempt by a liberal judge to force Hawaii to shoulder the financial cost of the justice's ""pet"" issue, ""gay"" rights. The author succinctly describes how the justice abandoned judicial reasoning in the vain attempt to engage in social engineering by misusing the power of the judiciary. Those in the legal profession, including Ronald Moon, the Chief Justice at the time, ought not wonder why laity has such a low estimate of jurists."
5,Great,"We were facing some financial challenges. I said if people who have cancer can listen to healing tapes then why not take that approach for a financial healing need. When I am overwhelmed, quoting and hearing God's Word is the best medicine. I would recommend this. The background music is perfect."
4,An Oldie but a Goodie!,"An arcade game from the 1980's that still gets your adrenaline pumping. The first time through is high action, and the subsequent plays thereafter are like the fisrt - just much, much faster! The upside (and downside) of this game is there's no end to it. You play until you run out of ships ... but how many times can YOU make it through? This reviewer has made it through 15 times ... but wants the chance to beat that at some point. ...."
5,Great Game,I was very surprised when i bought this game the NES version of Gyruss is better than the Playsation version on the Konami Classics. So i Highly Recommend this game to the old retro shooters! out there
4,70's soul returns,"Nevermind the other reviews, I find this latest release to be a smokey taste of 70's soul records. anyone remember curtis mayfield, al green, Teddy Pendergast, Stax???? the band has turned it's self around on this album, creating a coherent ambience. great music for a cocktail party, or dinner...i like to play it while i'm with my girlfriend, she likes it too."
2,.....Still waiting,"After waiting a few years for this album, I have to admit I was dissapointed at the outcome. The idea appears to be a mellow soul album, a throwback to Al Green, Stax/Volt, and seventies soul. Instead it comes across as bland and lifeless. Their previous album, ""My Secret Life"", sounded like 21st century soul music. It seemed as if Sonia Dada had endless ideas and were constantly improving their craft. Expectations were high for this album, as it was assumed it could springboard them to a wider audience.Unfortunately, ""barefoot Soul"" seems directionless, and as a listener I kept waiting for it to take off - which it never seems to do.There is no denying the talent contained within, as anyone who has seen this band live can attest too. But the album fails to deliver, and can only be viewed as a misstep."
1,What Happened Here!,"My husband surprised me with the new Sonia Dada CD last night, and I could hardly wait to listen to it. I should have waited! What the heck happened! Sonia Dada worked over a year on this release, unfortunately it sounds like it is was wiped together in a matter of weeks. I have been an avid fan of theirs for years and I'd been anxiously awaiting this new CD. Unfortunately, it has none of the energy and strong harmonies/melodies of the previous CD's. Boring and lackluster come to mind. The final cut ended rather abruptly, making me wonder if somehting was wrong with my CD. No, it was just a bad ending to really disappointing CD."
3,Not a Day at the Beach,"The classic sound of Sonia Dada rings true, but this is clearly not their best album. About half of the songs are just above mediocre to the point that I can't/won't remember their names."
5,great film,"""The Shaggy Dog,"" is really a great comedy and well worth seeing. I'd recommend it to adults and children alike. It's filled with adventure and good humor, really a classic disney film."
4,This Original Outshines the Remake,"This film is a classic family film to be enjoyed by everyone, and the recent remake can't hold a candle to it. Fred MacMurray, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are at their best."
3,Funny,"this is a funny movie about a teenager who finds this magic ring and reads what it says on the ring, he sometimes (you never now when) will turn into a dog, and worse the dog that he turns into belongs to a girl he likes. very funny good family movie"
2,"Found it mimicked 1 million other ""southern"" stories.","Must the South remain so blatantly the victim? This is another juvinile ""blame the world for our woes"" tale. Writing was okay but not worthy of more than a B- in a Freshman Eng Lit 101 class."
2,Functional but needs improvment,"I purchased this seatbelt/harness for use on my son's kettrike tricycle. It's design is functional but unfortunately, a little too simple. Instead of having a clasp on the center belt (the one that comes up from the center/bottom of the seat) into which the individual horizontal belts could connect to, the center belt has a loop in the end that you must thread the horizontal belts through. When Jr. wants to ride his fancy new tricycle and your still fumbling with the harness, things can get ugly. Lastly, this belt is made in China unlike the tricylce itself which was also dissapointing."
3,Need help -- does anyone know if this seatbelt works on other trikes?,I was hoping someone out there may know the answer to my question. Will this seatbelt fit Radio Flyer trikes or only Kettlers? I would really appreciate any help.
5,Kettler Seatbelt,This is a must have for little ones to ride the Kettler trikes. My son is one and he couldn't ride the bike without it!
3,hmmmm...,"All i can say is that i cant say too much about this because i couldnt really use it. It didnt fit my radio flyer bike i bought for my daughter. It was in the suggestion box when i added her bike to my cart but it didnt attach. I had to rig it to make it fit but, my rig job seems to work and it does its job"
5,Keeps the little guy in place.,"My 15 month old son received a Kettler tricycle as a gift from a family friend. The tricycle is wonderful, the only problem we ran into is keeping my son on the bike. After visiting Kettler's website I found the seatbelt attachment. The seatbelt attaches easily to the molded seat and keeps my little guy in place. We use the trike daily now that the weather is nice and have plans to bring it along t the zoo instead of the stroller. The seatbelt assures me that my son will stay on the trike and allows us more use of the trike. Great product and highly recommended."
2,Wrong Title For This CD,"Why only 2 stars? It was billed as something fresh and new... an underground treat. It was was none of the above. This coming from a big fan of this genre of music.First off the title ""Asia Massive"" is a misnomer. There are no Japanese, Chinese or East Asian influences on this record. A better title would have been ""Babylu"" because the influences are distinctly Middle Eastern and Indian.Normally I wouldn't make such a nationalistic recommendation, but these tunes could really benefit from more American influences, in particular funk, hip-hop and even some edgy rock chords thrown in for good measure. The syncopated drum kit programming on many of these tracks is distinctly of the soft CHEESE Euro disco variety. There is far too much female vocal whaling too... okay we like it, now just don't wear it out.If want to spend your money on this genre, you'd do a lot better if you bought ""Liberation"" by Karsh Kale."
3,"Adequate performance, terrible sound","The band is in good form and appears to be tight. I say appears because the sound quality is so poor much of the artistic merit is lost. At a time when concert DVDs are being recorded in full DTS (1.5 mbps) AND full PCM on the same disk, why is this concert only available in a two channel Dolby utilizing a paltry 192 kbps?"
2,Martin Kane Private Eye - Volumes 1-4 (4-DVD),"Martin Kane Private Eye came out in 1949 on TV by the Tabacco Company.It encourages strongly to use their product in the program.The United States Tobacco Company advertise smoking their tobacco all through the show of Martin Kane Private Eye.I would not recommend this DVD usless you are thinking about taking up smoking.If I had known that the Tabacco Company had put this show out, I would of not bought this Volume of 1-4 Martin Kane Private Eye."
4,Very nice!,"Very nice instrumental record (one piece has some artificial, stylized singing from Chris O'Connell of Asleep at the Wheel.)Excellent range of styles as the other reviewer mentioned -- not repetitive like instrumental records often are. Traditional, waltz, Mexican, Irish, jazz. Six of the pieces were written by O'Brien. I don't like the two Django tracks and track #1 (sounds like Chet Atkins when he took himself too seriously) -- but I very much like the rest of the generous 14 tracks. Listened to it three times the first day! Helpful and interesting comments by O'Brien in the folder.Well worth the money."
4,Worthwhile travel guide,"On my first trip to America, I rented a car to travel from San Fran Cisco to Los Angeles. I had heard that the coastal scenery was great but didn't know anything about the towns. This book was great for detailing the towns worth visiting and their particular appeal. We spent hours in Carmel browsing the galleries, wandering the pretty, 'old-english-style' streets and visited the monastery. The spanish style architecture in California was also fascinating and the book provided many of the more popular options such as San Luis Osbipo. The book captured the flavor of the towns we decided to visit, gave clear outlines of all worthwhile tourist attractions nearby and also gave information on best access route. Helpful for tourists unfamiliar with the States. All in all, as good as any travel book I have used."
4,highly reccomended,"Nice photos with clear instructions, including all mm sizes of glass bevels for ordering glass to completeeach pattern; something which other books do NOT always offer"
2,bevels and jewels in stained glass,The patterns are simple and simplistic. Not something I will want to work with.Was hoping for more.
5,Stain,stain glass is my favorite and I look at this book long ago when I am little. This book is really good for stain glass projects.
2,Can't make it work,"The idea of this capo looks great, but the actual result falls short. Do you see that white plastic piece on the left side of the picture. That makes that side of the capo stand a few milimiters above the strings. Unfortunately, I believe there should be another one on the other side too, as the small black pieces that are supposed to be lifted away from the strings do not actually stay on a safe distance on the other side, and then the strings are caught in their vibration by those black pieces, destroying the sound of what you are trying to play. I was really disappointed, specially because I bought two of those (one I was going to give as a gift to a friend)."
1,Falls short,I specifically bought this to go along with my 12-string guitar because it supposedly works on any guitar. However I was very disappointed when it really fell short and worked in virtually no configurations. I would not recommend anyone buying this unless you like disappointment.
5,Tough little game,"this is one of the more advanced games in the NES library, brought you by Sunsoft. The graphics are really good and the game mechanics work very smooth. Just like any Sunsoft game the music is outstanding! i find myself humming some of the music after a while, especially in level 1-1.The game can be very challenging, it gets tough around level 2-2, after that its pretty tough and tests your thinking skills and endurance. I have yet to beat this game, so good thing it uses a password. But the passwords are not randomly generated, they are level codes so they are always the same. like CGMW is level 2-2 (i think lol)Not a bad movie based game, everything seems to follow the movie."
1,poof,"Written by a paid administration shill, published by a right-wing vanity press, this weakly researched book had one defining characteristic: It took the side it was made for, blindly.Two years later, the fallacies the book expounded, and those built into the writing itself, have become widely exposed. The result, for a contemporary reader, will be just another expose of an overconfident administration, albeit one that back in 2004-2006 was still yet eager to project itself via any pay-to-write scribe it could get its hands on."
4,I'm learning some new things about the President,"So far the book is enjoyable. Of course I'm a bit biased, but I also think I have enough objectivity to point out mistakes. I think President Bush really is trying to protect our country with a vision of democracy as the final change agent versus war, which is a temporary fix. Is there a contradiction. Well the use of war (when diplomacy fails) is many times required as part of the solution execution. We're using war to give Iraq a democratic form of government, which"
5,Infuriating book to the liberals <smile>,"Reading the negative reviews makes me realize how powerfully irritating this book is to the Left. The whining, ridiculous, and mean-spirited comments of the Liberals are music to my ears.For example, the reviewer Torrey writes: ""...when a book appears making light of the Commender in Chief of the most powerful nation on the planet--who we all know can't even speak the English language-""....Now, Torrey, LOOK WHO IS TALKING! You cannot even spell correctly! Commender = Commander! Got you!!! Why are you so nasty? Is it because it is so trendy to be a Bush-basher? You are a trendy, aren't you? And you are not getting your way anymore? Throwing a little temper tantrum?Torrey also writes: ""And who are these white men (about 95% of them!) who are so determined to bend the world to their knees?..""Torrey, this sounds to me like a racist comment. But, again, this is so typical of the Left. Have a nice day!"
2,The Desperate Hours,"This was the kind of Ann Coulterish drivel that die hard right-wingers will run out to buy...and then never read. There isn't a challenging or provocative word in the entire book. When righties endorse a book like this, it lets the rest of us know just how much they are running scared. Like our Peter Pan president (I won't grow up I won't grow up), they are reaching for some very tired straws here. If only it were true that our President was wise, honest, and visionary. But he ain't, Blanche, he ain't! This kind of screed makes Peggy Noonan's books seem positively intelligent!"
2,Childishly Written,"I am a right wing super freak. I have no problems with the facts or views in this book. I do have a problem with the ""emotional coloring"" by Sammon. It's like he's trying activate certain emotions and attitudes that are childishly simplistic. Right out of the gate we go into the siege of Rove's home by misinformed libby protestors. Rove comes off sounding like a man cowering in a corner while people pound on his windows like a dawn of the dead movie. This book talks down to readers in a condescending way that only small children wouldn't notice and I keep remembering books from my childhood.....""see Jane run."" Bill....please stop helping my party."
1,What a joke...,"Particularly in light of more recent events, the travesty that is Bush's presidency becomes clear for all to witness in full.Look at the title of this book:""Strategery: How George W. Bush Is Defeating Terrorists...""There are many more terrorists now than there were on 9/11.""...Outwitting Democrats...""see last congressional election. It's not about outwitting democrats, it's about upholding American priciples, of which Bush understands little to nothing.""...and Confounding the Mainstream Media""Give me a break.Bush is on record as having said ""... don't give me that about the Constitution, it's just a goddamned piece of paper."" This is Bush at his best -- anti-American to the core."
4,Wow.,"[...]The author has gained fantastic access to the Bush administration. Period. That makes for an insightful book, which should be read while keeping the author's perspective in mind and should be judged by the quality of the writing at least as much as by any message it carries.[...]"
5,Good behind the scenes view,Just finished reading the book last night. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The book gives valuable insight into how decisions were made and the political reaction of the opposition.What you read in this book is not reported on the evening news or in your local paper.
5,A clear and concise vision,"Liberals will hate this book, and call it inflammatory and biased. However, they will have great difficulty arguing against the meat of this book, and will instead turn to attacks on the author and his political views, ignoring that unlike the collective agenda driven work of openly liberal news agencies like CBS with the intentional false reports on memogate, and the false reporting by Newsweek of destruction of a Korans at Guantanamo by guards, which lead to horrible violence and deaths, all set forth to do damage to the Bush administration, that backfired and cost these ideologues their jobs. Unlike that kind of slip-shot and reckless reporting, Bill Sammon has filled his book ""Strategery"" with substantiated and backed up information that blows holes through the left driven ideologues, like they were just cheap facial tissue."
2,A bit misleading,If Bush is doing all this (title claims) why do only one out of three support him. Certainly if you are the one of the three you will find this excellent support (like drinking the kool aide or your own bathwater for that matter). It is certainly obvious that you can fool the people for extended periods of time but sooner of later it catches up.
1,C'mon- does anyone actually believe this garbage?,"The author acts as if the ""mainstream media"" were out to get GW Bush, and Bush artfully manipulates them. The Bush Administration certainly manages to manipulate the mainstream media, but they do it with cold, hard cash, not clever ""strategery"". Ask Armstrong Williams. And if he's busy, ask Ruperty Murdoch. C'mon- the ""mainstream media"" is a division of corporate america. Do any of you troglodyte Bush zombies seriously believe they're out to get George?This book does the same as every other piece of pro-Bush propaganda; it claims that Bush is a giant, fighting massive opposition and just barely winning. The fact is that he's a mental midget, with the entire game stacked in his favor and STILL just barely winning."
1,Is this a joke?,"Only the most rabid bush fans and evangelical extremists will like this book. How can anyone dispute the frightening direction our country has been going in since 2000. From the radical religious right to the destructive policies of the Bush administration that is polarizing, dividing, and driving this once great country into the ground. This does not feel like the United States anymore since the Bush Regime took office.Remember only EDUCATION, can combat conservatism. We need to take this country back and set it on the right course. God help us.I highly recommend the book ""American Theocracy"", written by a Republican conservative."
2,The lamest of the three,"I think I pretty much said it all in the review title.This is the lamest one. Why did they try to add punches and kicks to a perfectly great shooter game.It was a Stupid idea and this game is hardly a challenge. I passed it in three days.Don,t buy it because you will be dissappointed. BUY THE FIRST IKARI WARRIORS NOW ON EBAY!"
1,DIVA STARZ ARE THE UGLIEST DOLLS EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"Diva starz are the ugliest dolls I've ever seen, so it's no good by saying they ""rule"". Just look at those hugely fat bodies and big eyes. Bratz are much prettier and they have more fashion passion than barbie, my scene, Diva Starz, or any other trashy group of totally uncool dolls by Mattel."
2,Very dry and amateur,"Very, very, dry, boring non professional video. Sort of like your neighbor shot it in the 70s. Very disappointing video."
5,Excellent source for a spiritual retreat,"This book is written so it can be used privately, as well as with a group, for spiritual growth. All that is required is to take some quiet time, daily if possible, to reflect on the various spiritual qualities discussed ~ such as 'listening,' 'humility,' perseverance,' 'joy,' I highly recommend it."
5,Benedict's Way : An Ancient Monk's insight for a balanced li,"Wow! what a great book I couldn't put it down. The authors are fantastic writers, I can't wait for their next book. Everybody should have a copy on their coffee table. Loved it!"
4,Great System,"This is my first surround sound system and it has served me well. I even used it at a very small gig (because I'm a dj, and don't have PA speakers). And it actually worked..... not very well. Thankfully the room was only twice as big as my bed room, and there were only 30 people. The little 8in sub puts out more power than one might think. However the amp got so hot that I burnt my self when I touched the top grill. Verdict: Do not use this system at Dj gigs.The surround sound works very well with movies and video games, (make sure that you use a fiber optic cable for true surround sound)"
4,Ok,"What ever became of a basic good sounding audio system with a simple bass& treble control. It sounds good but it is sure complex to me. I guess I am getting old. It has a ton of small buttons on the remote. If you get into it, it's very complex."
3,Impossible Menus,"Although this system sounds generally good out of the box, the bass is much too strong. Even after the automatic tuning with the included mic, the bass is much too strong. The menus are impossible to figure out (two PHDs tried). They are nonsensical and confusing and often get in a loop that you cannot get out of unless you turn the unit off. In short, good sound, but not sensational. Bass much too strong and even turned way down it is still too strong. And HORRIBLE menu system that defies use. There have to be better systems out there where the menu system is carefully thought out and sensible."
3,i dont understand,one person complains too much bass. the other says not enough.. does anyone even realise you can open the speaker cases and then change the wires over yourself?as stated i just dont understand.may buy this one though. :)
5,Excellent Choice,"I purchased this item recently and it's excellent in all aspects. It took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually. The subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive. The centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth, but still it does a good job. Overall, I would say it's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance."
4,Great for the price,"This is my first AV receiver system. I didn't know what to expect. I like Sony products and decided to give this a try as it was cheap in amazon (even before using my gift card).Sometimes, i feel the bass is too high even when i reduce it. But, overall i feel it's an awesome purchase. Especially, watching DVDs with DTS 5.1 output is awesome using this system.One problem with the receiver is that the controller (or whatever it's called) is too big and has very few buttons to control it. Most of the controls are in the remote control. The remote (kinda) operates as a TV remote (i have a Sony Wega TV), but the controls are really dumb. I have to hold a button named 'TV' everytime i want to use the receive remote as a TV remote. I now have 4 remotes :( Some receivers come with an universal remote, but they are expensive. So, you get what you pay for. I consider this a good purchase."
5,Fascinating experience for those willing to take it,"The first of the three novellas is more accessible and conventional than the other two, but it may not be the best. All three are rich and textured with layers of meaning of those willing to spend the time with them. As with all translations, I wonder what there was in the original that I am missing by reading the story second hand. I get the sense that this is a careful translation. (Someone will probably tell me I am way off on that judgment.) If you are willing to venture into a different culture, I think you will be rewarded by reading these three novellas."
4,Enjoyable book,"I enjoyed all three stories in here. It was a new experience to read Su Tong's work because his writing style and narration was different from most other authors that I have read. I also saw the movie with the same name, and it was interesting to note the differences between the story and the film - the bad servant that constantly antagonizes Lotus is punished in very different ways in the movie and book. All in all, a good read."
4,Hope the movie is this good,"This TPB collects the 3 issue mini-series that serves as a prequel to the upcoming and much delayed Man-Thing film, the latest Marvel comic to film adaptation. Written by the film's screenwriter Hans Rodionoff and illustrated by Hulk and the Hood artist Kyle Hotz, Whatever Knows Fear is a more than solid horror tale, centering around an insurance claim investigator sent to a murky, swampy town to investigate the strange phenomina regarding a less than reputable corporation, and just what happened to a missing security guard and why is the other rambling about swamp monsters. This TPB is surprisingly suspenseful, and Hotz' art shines through, and the ending does actually leave you anticipating to see what happens next in the film. That is, if the Man-Thing movie ever comes out."
2,WHEN WOMEN SEEK NEW LOVERS,"Elaine DenholtzHaving It Both Ways:Married Women with Lovers(Briarcliff Manor, NY: Stein & Day, 1981) 239 pagesConventional married women having affairs because of problemsin their marriages (some of which ended in divorce)and because of other personal needs such as:companionship and communication; ego enhancement;desire for more and better sex; boredom with mates;personal crises; changing needs.They tried their best to keep their affairs secret.Frequently their husbands were also having affairs.If you would like to find more positive ideas about such matters,search the Internet for this bibliography:""Multiple Loving Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, author ofNew Ways of Loving: How Authenticity Transforms Relationships"
5,Whatch out kylie!!!,"I would have to say, that this song is kind of competivite to kylie minogues work. Although it's kind of retro-disco, it can sure enough be something to buy. If you like Cher- I think you'll like this. HOllA"
4,Not as polished as Ultimate Alliance but still FUN!,"This game plays the same Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends. However, Justice League's controls are less responsive/more clunky than those other two games. If the controls were spot-on, I would have been happy to give it a 5-star rating. Nevertheless, it was FUN to play 2-player with a friend or by myself. Enemies and bosses were sufficiently smart and challenging to play with. Level ups and skill system are interesting and rewarding. I hope they make another and just fine tune the controls."
3,justice league heroes,Over all its a pretty fun game but I was disappointed in fact that you are not able to chose your character from the start of the game. plays well and is overall fun with a friend.
1,Not a good bet for Caballe fans.,"The material on this program--which was a benefit--was good. I wish I could have heard it. The sound production was terrible. Often, the only indication that the piano was playing was that the Great Zanetti's fingers were moving across the keys. Caballe's voice, likewise, was audible only in certain registers. The photography was likewise bad. Don't waste your money, especially if you love Caballe."
2,Very Disappointing!,"According to the books help desk, the CD-ROM was upgraded recently and that is why the contents do not match the book! Several concepts and solutions are wrong. If you are not a strong user of Excel, you will be taught some wrong things. In addition, numerous tips/shortcuts in Excel are never mentioned. If you are studying for the MOUS Excel 2000 expert exam, this is not a good book!"
5,Just what I needed!,Hard-to-find item for my 15-year-old Braun 5524 pocket portable shaver which I love and couldn't find anywhere else. Fits perfectly! Like brand-new!
5,Leading of change from the inside out.,This is a guide for engaging in organizational change in the public sector. A major theme of this work is the leading of change from the inside out. The author covers: a holistic view of organization change; data collection and analysis; mediation roles of change agents; empathy and encouragement; cooperation; and holistic learning. The book contains a lot of detailed guidelines and insights. Many references. Recommended.
2,Disappointed with look of fire,"I was disappointed in the appearance of the fire. Although it has a fire like look, it has a reflective backing that worked as a mirror. We could sit and view ourselves and everything else that was happening in front of the fireplace. The insert just did not meet our expectations."
2,Nice Item - Durability Questionable,"This has the potential of being a very nice product. Worked well, looks great. Throws off decent heat.My fan broke after 18 months, and the solution from the manufacturer was for me to purchase a replacement module for $80. Thanks again to Chinese manufacturing !! When will we ever learn?*** UPDATE 2/2010 ***Refused to spend the money for a replacement motor and tore the unit apart myself. All I needed to do was to gently ""center"" the metal blower frame by pushing it away from one side. Then the unit began working normally. I did this 6 months ago and the fix still stands. It may need to have this ""adjustment"" every year or so. Still, would have been helpful if the people at Dimplex suggested this simple fix - so I'm keeping my rating as it stands. Hope this helps someone out there."
5,Works wonderfully!,"We bought this to place into a gel fireplace stand, since we needed it for heat. We used it this past summer and in the North East it was a viscous one! It worked WONDERFULLY in our living room and did exactly what we wanted it to do. It does look relatively realistic but the mirror background is kind of a give away lol. Either way it does the job we need it to do and looks cute doing it. I would recommend this to anyoen I know interested in a heater fireplace."
5,"no fuss, just push the remote, nice, and the girls like it!","Set it in pluged it in and pushed the remote, it was very nice, the heater could use a few more cfm fan to blow the heat out into the room, but i did not buy it for a heater.At the front door in less than a week with free shipping. Less than Home depot."
3,beautiful but doesn't heat very well,"I really love the way this looks but in a 13x18 ft room it only raised the temp 1 degree in 2 hours, So if you actually need it for heat I would look at another one."
3,"Nice, but...",It is a good design and it fits our fireplace. But it could use more BTU in the heat ouput.
5,GREAT,"This is the perfect solution if you love a fire but dont have a working fireplace. It looks like it is part of my fireplace and looks really nice in my livingroom with my Christmas decorations on the mantel. It doesnt put out much heat though, which I hoped that it would"
3,pretty but not hot,"this item arrived in good shape, fit the fire box perfectly, and it looks very nice, realistic flames, however, if you need a little heat to go along with the flames, that's what you get, very little heat."
4,product as described,"Product and price fine, Would not do business with company again, I tried to contact them about an error in the delivery addresss. They did not respond and were unreachable . I did eventually get a voice message after the order was shipped to the wrong address. I had to drive to UPS at my former address to pick up the order , I wasted more than half a day and gas with the work they created by not responding to my efforts to correct the address"
3,No Heat,"We live in Orlando Florida. So we do not need a lot of heat. Therefore, we are lucky. The item fails to really shoot heat out. If you are getting for ease of set up and use....sure. But don't buy for heat purposes! You'll be disappointed."
5,Great product recommended to purchase it.,Great product recommended to purchase it. Price is reasonable and afforable. It heat up my basement livinjg room and family enjoy the warm Christmas day.
5,OK for what I was looking for,"The circuit I put this on dims when I put on the flame, heat and fan, but doesn't have an effect when I put on the flame lights only. I wasn't going to shell out another buck and a half for the deluxe model, and this model has more of a halo, but it does provide an ambience without burning wood or using a natural gas log."
4,Dimplex Fire Logs,"After much online review, I chose the Dimplex firelog set for my use. I replaced some LP gas logs to reduce costs. I do not need a extreme heat producer for my house in Florida and the ambiance of the Dimplex logs is very good. The unit does produce a small amount of heat and I suppose if you left the unit on for several hours it would heat a small room. I strongly recommend this unit for an application as I have."
4,Realistic Burning Fire,"This electric fireplace insert is very ""real"". The flames have the motion and hypnotic rhythm of a real fire. Amazing. The only problem I had was that I purchased this insert for an insert I already had that had stopped working so it wasn't really meant to fit in the same space. So I purchased some molding and cut 2 pieces to fit either side. I gave them a couple coats of black matte paint and it looks like it's a part of the insert. Very happy with the look and the way it turned out!!"
3,"OK, but somewhat of a disappointment","I would not recommend this if you have a large fireplace opening, It looks like what it is, an insert with some ersatz logs. I remedied this somewhat by putting a fireplace screen in front of it. Somewhere along the line I'll replace this with something more realistic (and more costly - this is very reasonably priced)."
2,look fake,"The crescent half moon mirror makes it look so fake, even the flame is more realistic. I have to cover with a tinted window film, and overall, not satisfied."
1,fancy hair dryer,"We got largest model for our fireplace, which is larger than across the front of the heater unit. The fan is too low powered -- when the Dimplex unit is in fireplace the fan is not strong enough to blow horizontally with a force that gets most of the heat out into the room - more like fan on a hair dryer. The fake fire effect is ok, but now we are thinking of switching to a gas log unit / depends on the price of gas utilization."
3,Fine but...,"Very realistic flame but missing of crackling sound is dissapointing.Also, the heather part is not powerfull. Such are the reasons for three stars only."
3,"Provocative Points, but Lacks Practical Understanding","Lee's thesis that the ""reasonable man"" standard is biased against women, GLBT persons, and members of racial and ethnic minorities is provocative and well supported with history and case law. Her suggestions for race-switching jury instructions raise questions about the reader's own biases and assumptions.The problem comes in Lee's understanding of use-of-force issues especially issues relating to reaction times (which can result in shots to the side or back), stress hormones and memory (which can result in fragmented memory), stress hormones and fine muscle control (which makes it hard to practically shoot to wound), and the ability of handgun fire to penetrate standard building materials (which makes warning shots dangerous). Lee's book should be read in combination with practical self-defense and use-of-force articles by respected writers like Masaad Ayoob and Phil Messina."
4,Interesting only if you are interested in collectables,"My mother in law is part owner of an antique shop and my wife has inherited a great deal of interest in antiques and collectables. Among other things, a wooden Indian with cigars in his right hand stands in out basement. We also occasionally go to sales and see old toys and other collectable items.Therefore, this book was an interesting look at the collections that one person has acquired over the years. I recall seeing items very similar to many appearing in this collection. My grand and great grandparents also had toys similar to those pictured in this book, and I vaguely remember seeing them when I was young.If you are a collector or just interested in old toys and similar items, then you will enjoy this book."
5,Fun lesser known title for the nes,Just recently bought this game again loved it as a kid love it as an adult not a big title on the nes noone had ever really heard of it in the 80's and probaly noone has heard anything about it current days its an easy game concept go through the stages blasting the enemy nothing fancy just a good old shooter It will keep you busy for hours very fun and for the price cost of a pack of bubble gum this is a worthy edition to anyones nes collection.
4,Good Reference Book,"I have been through this book and its companion book for Freehand MX and have the same comment for this one that I had for the Freehand MX version. Almost Great! Thorough enough to be used as a reference but the actual examples need some editing. There was a lack of consistency to simple things like ""select both items"" being sometimes written and sometimes left to the reader to figure out. Overall, a good book for a beginner who will refer to it often for a reference."
3,Decent for beginners,"Don't buy this book if you have a good, working knowledge of Fireworks MX. The lessons are very basic and will not serve you if you are looking for advanced web graphics design. To the publisher: Add a ""search inside this book"" synopsis! It would have saved me the hassle of returning it to Amazon."
3,Disappointed,"I needed to create a logo, so I went to chapter 2 ""using vector tools"" and was disappointed in the presentation. I found myself getting lost in the explanations because of the lack of effort in the navigation of the tool bars and options in Fireworks. I figured out what I had to do but it was a lot more effort on my part then the books."
3,Interesting,Ready this book while freezing to death one winter in college in Zurich. The only book at the public library in English and I thought the title was a laugh riot... it got better :-) Funny but pathetically so... I want to read it again
5,shower filter cartridge,"The cartridge fit perfectly in my shower filter, which is more than I can say about another replacement filter that I ordered elsewhere, and I do plan to order from the same company from now on."
2,Cook goes to the well once too often,"The two star rating may be a bit unfair, because if I had read 'The Chatham School Affair' before I read 'Breakheart Hill' I probably would have liked it much more. As it was, I was disappointed because I felt like I was reading 'Breakheart Hill' all over again.Thomas H. Cook is an extremely gifted writer, and this book should probably not be missed. Unfortunately, I think the book was unoriginal."
2,The faux elegiac tone of the book grew tedious.,"By chapter three, author had beaten into the reader that Something Bad was Going to Happen. By chapter six I wished it had happened and that this book was a novella! This is a book full of character that are difficult to like or feel sorry for, and the constant flashbacks wore me out."
4,Another good read from Mr. Cook,"Thomas Cook appears to use a similar theme in many of his psychological mysteries: the conflict between passion/impulse and the need to do good for others and society. His books also present the theme of what irrevocable damage can be done by a particular deed or behavior. His technique of telegraphing inward, working from the future to the present is very interesting as a literary technique. I enjoy his novels immensely. They are intelligent and page-turners."
5,The Chatham Affair,"This sensitively written book is one of Thomas Cook's finest. He introduces not only the characters with a flourish - but embraces the entire surroundings of the community, thus, creating an atmosphere conducive to relaxing. The reader enters a world of slower living in a beautiful location. I, myself, have frequented just such a place and have considered it to be the first step into heaven. In fact, in reading this, I was able to once again hear the ocean breeze rustling through the scrub pines. It created a certain nostalgia in my soul and reminded me, once more, that people are similiar - no matter what period in time they exist."
1,This book is almost as dull as Zia Summer.,"As a short story, the plot would be interesting. But as a long novel it repeats itself - from father to cottage to teacher, to black pond.At the end you say ""who cares"" and go looking for the latest Kaminsky or Kerr publication. If Cook deserved the Edgar it certainly should not been for this book."
3,Silly book. Reviews didn't indicate how silly.,This was one of my Kindle experiments. Wished I had more information to review the story before I ordered. Will not make that mistake again.
2,Easy to put down - just average (2.5 stars),"The first book by Cook that I have read and probably the last. Not that it was poorly written or that there wasn't some interest to the plot, just that the book dragged a little and was easy to put down. For interesting heartfelt characters try Ron Rash or John Hart instead."
5,A real classic in the making.,"It is no wonder that four years after publication you still find a lot of references to this book and even see it quite often still on special display in the bookstore.It is the combination of being a thriller ( with all the twists and surprises) and a real classical tragedy that makes this book so appealing.The love story of Miss Channing and Mr.Reed unfolds and ends like probably a lot of them have ended in real life in the periods just after the war and one sits back and wonders about the beliefs and moral values in the community which helped the tragedy to take it's pace.It is exceptional when a writer, particularly one writing thrillers which also have the objective to entertain, can make you question your own beliefs about the right and wrong in human behaviour."
4,Spellbinding But Deceptive,"Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister. The preview outshines the work itself. I did enjoy reading it, however; Cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. His style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion."
2,Chatham School Affair,"Didn't enjoy the style of the story. Too disjointed for me. Said in 25 words what could, and in my opinion should, have been said in 5 words."
5,Edgar award,Thomas cook won the Edgar award on this book. Great read . I recommend it. Cook is one of my all time favorite mystery writers
4,Beautifully written but too much like his Breakheart Hill,"This was my introduction to the author, his second major book. He writes so beautifully unfolding the story in a series of flashbacks giving both the child's and the adult's perspective, until you think you have all the answers, except you don't.I naturally wanted more Cook, so I read his first bestseller, Breakheart Hill. Unfortunately the format was exactly the same. Both dealt with unrequited love, told in flashback, an unsolved or missolved mystery in a small town, etc. So for that reason I felt let down. I'd like to see this fine author take a different approach next time."
4,Spell check please! (Kindle version),Loved the book but the continuous spelling and grammar errors made it frustrating to finish. In this day and age spelling should not play a role in the rating of a book but I was so bothered by so many errors I just had to write. Otherwise the book is a good read and keeps you interested throughout.
4,"Excellent wind-up and ending, but not a great journey","I read the book, and enjoyed it very much, but I loved the whole ending better than the body of the book."
4,"Good story, confusing plot, surprise ending!","The book had the feeling of old town America, yet the characters were somewhat confused about their roles. It was, to me, very slow, yet some parts were very good and moved at a reasonable pace. I was depressed, yet I kept on reading. I think mostly to see if things would improve, and they did. The ending is great, and quite surprising."
5,Just the sort of stuff I expect from Eyvind Kang,"I've been enjoying Mistress Eyvind on records by Andrew Drury and Aiko Shimada. And it's a relief to hear modern-day pop-music arrangements that incorporate non-electronic instruments. (Bassoons and violas continue to exist, ya know. I can promise you. I've seen them with my own eyes. I haven't heard them too much, of course. But I can assure you that they're still out there somewhere.)Thom Yorke's female-vocal-doppelganger has finally reared her scrumptious head in the form of Angie Benintendi. And let's face it, she's a lot easier on the ears than Thom is.My favorite passage is the extended coda of 123. I have a pet name for that 2-note motif. I call it Lenthoven. Coz it sounds like a cross between John Lennon and Beethoven."
4,"Loads of excellent color photography, but regular text","I read this good book, here in Brazil. This book has these great things:1- This book has dozens of excellent color photography. In fact, more than 70% of this book are its photos. The photos are all of good or amazing quality and 100% with color. Five stars for the photos.2- This book is very easy to understand.3- The shape of this book is excellent.4- The paper used in his book is excellent.5- This book is well organized.Even with these qualities, I have to give just four stars, because of the text of this book.The problem is that there isn't enough text in this book. Not all the giant dump trucks brands are in this book. Only american made dump trucks are in this book. There isn't any sentence about dump trucks made in Japan, Russia, England or Germany in all this book. Being incomplete in text leave me to give four stars in this book."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this ""Gibson"" brand bridge for my les paul studio faded. which had a defective bridge on it. The adjustment screws on this official gibson part are so sloppy in fit in the threaded bushing there is 1/16th of an inch play when the bridge is at 3/4 height.It definitely isnt worth the money since you have to reply on the string pressure to keep it from flopping around. I would say their quality is going downhill, the bridge that came on the brand new les paul studio had the A and E saddles the same height. So a low action without buzz is impossible. And this bridge is really no better.Also note this bridge doesnt have notches, so it should not be compared to the gibson web site. I am guessing gibson stopped notching them to cut costs."
5,"Thorough, analytical, and highly insightful.","This book is a must read for those interested in understanding the evolutionary development of the American Constitution. Not only do the authors provide understandable interpretations of significant Supreme Court decisions, but they also capture the Zeitgeist which also played a major role. This book is well researched and written for scholars and non-scholars alike. Highly recommended for anyone interested in American history."
2,Not too Hot,"I'll keep this short and sweet, don't buy these socks. Hard to put on a fit very poorly. New balance socks are the same price and feel and fit great."
2,Big,"Much bigger than the description, it did not fit my foot size 9.Unfortunately I had to request a refund."
2,weird socks,these are nice comfortable socks but what is weird is that they keep getting bigger... after 6 months of use when comparing them witha new pair they are 3 inches longer from toe to heal...
5,perfecto,excelentebuena comprabuena calidadbuena telagenuinafue entregada en el momento adecuado sin inconvenientesbuen colorexcelentelo recomiendoaprovechenoriginalduraderabuena costuraperfecto
1,Buyer *Beware*,"After my first wash, two socks developed holes in them, and the rest have pilled heavily. I'd be surprised if these socks lasted two more washes.These socks are worthless. There is no way the positive reviews are from legitimate customers."
3,Addidas Quarter Socks,Very durable especially with hand wash. Compared to other ones I have had in the past this one is a good buy. The delivery was also excellent.
3,Fits well,"The socks are OK, not the best that i've worn till date. It fits well, but the socks seems to loose its quality at the ankles and feels as if it can tear away easily, as its not as thick as it is near the feet. I may pick up New Balance socks at Sam's club next time, they were the best i've had so far"
1,Adidas Men's quarter sock,I bought these socks recently through Amazon. I will buy these again. They are not comfortable and very brittle. They are poorly made. They also look terrible.
3,Soft and Tough,"Nice comfortable, SOFT wearing socks that don't slip down the ankle. It is TOUGH and frustrating to get them on straight - difficult to determine where heel is. Frequently pull them on and have the logo facing front or back instead of on side. Agreed this is a minor problem but very annoying early in the day."
2,Uncomfortably Tight,"I found these socks to be too tight, I wear size 9-1/2 shoes and can not imagine anyone with larger feet feeling comfortable at all in them. I would suggest checking out Gold Toe socks, they feel much better and are very durable."
3,Not bad as a reference,This books deals with all kinds of manipulators. It has a good amount of math but looks not enough and not easy to understand (I did not go into the math details). I think this book would be a good reference in your library where it has a good amount of advanced information about manipulators.
4,Classic Kirby,"This is Kirby at his Purest. Nothing but Classic Kirby gameplay, great graphics and sound (Best on the system), and really nice level design. No major flaws worth noting. This is what the basic gameplay of all Kirby games is based on. The graphics are amazing for it's system. Some of the sand hills on level 2-2 look almost realistic. I rate this game 88/100."
5,Lovely book about landscape and vision,"This book is a real gem. It's history, and it explains better than anything I've read how people actually looked at things and perceived them in the sixteenth through early nineteenth centuries. In particular, Dubbini focuses on how the landscape was perceived and how it seemed to change as it became increasingly interrupted by towns and cities. He explains how ""the glance"" evolved in relation to the relative anonymity and isolation of city life. And he discusses how these changes in ""looking"" inevitably affected what was chosen to be painted and how it was accomplished. He also looks at how advances in mapmaking and new scientific technologies (including photography) have impacted the way we see. This is an invaluable book, and, considering that it is quite erudite, a pleasure to read. Unusual illustrations, too."
1,ambiguous color,"thought these pants were grey, only to find out they're white with blue pinstripes. not what i wanted. they'll get limited use in the summertime but that's it. beware of the color."
3,John Grisham can permanently breathe easy,"After reading this novel, I can say without a doubt that I'll never read any of Reed Arvin's other books. In English class, our teacher always taught us to never write like you speak, and it's clear that Arvin never had an English teacher tell him that before. His book jumps from tense to tense, making it incredibly difficult to follow. He's not an eloquent writer by any means. Arvin definitely does not have the skills or caliber of writing to dethrone the likes of John Grisham. This book was choppy, easy to predict and wasn't written well at all. He simply never truly developed his characters throughout the book and it always felt like he was narrating more than throwing us into the story. I always felt like I was reading from an outside perspective or bird's eye view rather than being brought into the storyline. He should have stayed in the music business and left writing to the professionals."
5,Beware - this is a non-stop read!,"I picked up the Advanced Reader and thought I would skim it since it had Nashville as a setting. However much to ""my dismay"", I was hooked from page one and read it every chance I could get over a weekend. It is a legal thriller with a taste of downtown Nashville. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as has everyone with whom I have shared it. I am now reading The Last Goodbye and can't wait for his next book!"
4,The Final Sanction: Final Destination?,"This was an excellent book I bought for the sheer liking of the teaming of the 2nd Doctor, Jamie and Zoe. When I began reading, I found the book enthralling, and I couldn't really put it down. But, as I approached the middle, it dipped and I didn't find the plot could keep me reading for more than half an hour. Then, as I got to the last six or seven chapters, I picked it up again and it made me want to read more and more. Having not read ""The Murder Game"", I didn't know who the Selatians were, but by the end of the book, I certainly did find out! The book follows the typical Steve Lyons writing mould, including some interesting characters with good characterisations and a good characterisation of the Doctor and his companions. Read it for the sheer fun of it - read it if you're bored. Just read it!"
5,Quick. Effective. Durable,"First time purchasing a Merkur, over the years I've been using gillette which bad in quality compared to this razor. It takes at most five minutes to prepare, lather shaving gel or whatever your method is, and shave. I haven't been cut using this blade whereas I've been cut several times using the others, namely gillette."
4,Old school shaving,"I've used a brush and shaving soap/cream for many years but always with whatever the latest Gillette was. But I decided to try an old style safety razor instead of what you get at the drug store and this is the one I bought. So far so good. I like the longer length and the weight and balance feel good in your hand as you're shaving. Because you have to slow down a little it makes shaving feel like more an event than the Fusion does. I don't know if this is good or bad, but for me that's the way the way it is. The quality of the razor is also evident."
2,Not exactly symmetrical,"I would return this if I could. I thought this would have been a terrific razor considering the reviews. However, after a few months of use and switching blades (again, switching) I have noticed that one side shows more blade than the other...hence one side of the shave is ""closer"". Not sure what to do."
3,Aggressive Razor,"This was the first DE razor that I bought (based on the reviews). While it has a nice heft and feel, the razor was too aggressive for me, even after experimenting with different blades. I ended up setting it aside and getting a Gillette ""Black Beauty"", which is an adjustable razor, which works much better for me.If you like a more aggressive razor, I'd recommend the Merkur: it's a well-balanced and beautiful machine. It just wasn't for me."
5,Fantastic,Just got this the other day and love it! The weight feels great. Build is really nice. I think this could last me a lifetime. The only downside is there was no maintenance instructions just in case I didn't know how to maintain metals.
4,Well made razor but get nicks every time,"I know the razor is fine and it is my own fault, but I cut myself every time I use this. I tried for 6 months and gave up on it."
5,good grip and weight,The heft of the razor makes it a lot easier to shave compared to lighter safety razors. It's a well-made product with quality details.
1,Worst Shave Possible,"I do not like the double edge safety razor, even the cheap throw aways give you a bbs shave. Better to buy a different item."
2,shaving snobs,"Well folks, here is a different review of this razor and DE razor blades (Merkur platinum and Feathers). I have used Gillette products for many years and have been very satisfied, except for price (more on this).But I decided after reading many glowing reviews that I would try DE tehnology.Let me count the ways that DE is inferior in my judgement.1. Gillette Proglide gives a closer shave.2. There is more razor burn with DE.3. There are far more nicks and cuts with DE razors. I tried DE for about two weeks and this was after watching the excellent video review. I used this razor and Merkur and Feather blades. Merkur was slightly better of the two.4.The Proglide is better at reaching tough spots on face.The only benefit, in my opinion, for DE technology, is the cost. Yes, the Proglide is probably 3 times the cost of the DE blades. But I get longer use and the overall cost is probably twice of the DE system. So if cost is your primary concern go DE, otherwise I cannot recommend it."
2,I'm not too impressed,"I bought two DE razors....a Merkur 180 and an Edwin Jagger. While beautiful to look at andnostalgic, the DE razors can't match the Gillette Fusion razor for a smooth, comfortable shave. All the DE razors leave you with more razor burnand nicks and take longer to shave with. And they are hard to shave around the chin area. So save your money.The big knock against the cartridge razors are the cost and the fact that they only last about two weeks.Mine last two months. Here's how. After you shave, rinse and towel dry the razor....then hit itwith the hair dryer for about 15 seconds or so. You see, it's the rust that forms on the wet blades that causesthem to go dull, rather than the shaving. Try it and see.....it works!"
2,Beginers Razor,"This razor is for beginners or ladies, is it not aggressive, it is like having a Merkur Futur on the #1 setting and not being able to change it."
5,Great first safety razor!,"I just recently got into wetshaving thanks to the fine people at r/wickededge. This razor is well made and gives me a quality shave every time. If you're thinking about getting into wetshaving, you could do a lot worse than this guy for a first DE blade."
5,Excellent,"Product works very well. 5 stars. My guy loves it. He's African American, suffers from ingrown hair. He could only shave once a week. I hated it!! But since I bought him the Merkur Model 180, he's been shaving everyday. I love it!! But be sure to use a razor bump stopper shaving cream or after shave. I got him the Tend Skin. Works great. All in all, I highly recommend this single edge razor for any African American men with ingrown hair."
5,Why use anything else?,"After using this razor for a week, I must say I'm baffled to explain how multi-blade cartridge razors ever caught on. I can't think of any advantages whatsoever to using them, because this razor is just as easy to use, takes the same amount of time, cuts closer, and irritates my skin less. It's also easier to clean, and while it does cost more than the ""handle"" of a cartridge model, the blades are a fraction of the cost of cartridges. I imagine I'll break even in a few months' time.By the way, it works fine with regular canned shave cream, too, if you're not into the whole cup-and-brush routine."
3,Dropped once in the bathroom and broken,I liked this razor a lot. I got it as a gift this last year and it's given me a great shave since then. Too bad I had to go back to my old razor which just seems to pull on my whiskers. Why? I dropped it in the bathroom and it broke. The screw that mounts the base of the razor to the handle broke off and won't re-secure. Now I'm debating getting a new one or switching to something else.
2,"JUST DOESN""T CUT IT!","I bought this product in an attempt to get away from disposable razors that become dull very quickly.This razor cuts skin very well but fails miserably at the task of cutting facial hair. Scrape, lather, scrape, lather, rinse, etc., and the stubble remains. Even an electric razor will provide a closer shave than this product. I am disappointed."
2,It's OK,"It works OK, but for what I paid for it, you can buy a lot of Gillette Fusion cartridges. The shave is in no way superior."
