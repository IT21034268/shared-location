3,Shredder Oil,"Product was delivered in a very timely manner, as promised. One of the bottles was leaking a little bit and got some oil in the box that it was shipped in."
4,"Great stuff, only 4 stars though, I guess the price bugs me a little","It works great, just as promised. Made a huge difference in the operation of my shredder. ~$6 is kind of pricey for a small bottle of oil, but you really don't need much at all, you can completely soak a piece of paper with very little, and it's more than enough to clean it out. I'm guessing 1 bottle of this stuff will last years."
5,Fellowes Shredder Oil,Very good product. I use it monthly for my Aurora Shredder which is an excellent shredder and keeps it running smoothly.
5,"Great, Only a little is needed","I made the mistake of oiling my shredder like I was changing the oil in my car. I got a little carried away. Oil was everywhere and stuck in the container. The next batch, I just used a little and it worked just fine. This is the longest I have kept a shredder and I think this product has helped. My last shredder only lasted two dumps before it went bye-bye."
1,What a rip off.,"Okay--so to get me to the price I needed for free shipping, why not buy the oil to maintain my new shredder? Well, don't do it. Why? Because it is vegetable oil. The user's manual tells you to simply use veggie oil to maintain your shredder. And I think I paid almost ten bucks for this! Don't buy it!"
4,Enhanced Performance!,"I spoke with Fellowes, they say it's OK to use regular cooking vegetable oil (canola, etc.) in their machines, but only temporarily, not in the long run, because regular vegetable oil may become sticky and start smelling rancid. I'll stick with the dedicated oil and give it just 4 stars since there exists an alternative. I will, however, give Fellowes 5 stars for their candor. Also, be careful not to cut too big a chunk in the nozzle, so you won't waste the oil when oiling your machine."
2,Not sure why I can't just use veg oil...,"This was quite an expensive purchase. Other than the fact that it is odorless, I am wondering why I can't just use vegetable oil. That's what this looks like anyhow."
1,Use Vegetable Oil,"No need to purchase this. It is not worth the money. If they engineered a super oil, perhaps that would be enough."
3,It's Oil,"...that means it will keep your shredder running smoothly if you use it a ton and apply the oil occasionally. However I doubt you will use the whole bottle or even half the bottle during the lifetime of your shredder. Just another way for Fellows to make some money. Would prefer two or three different sized bottles, depending on the usage levels of the shredder (not everyone shreds 100 documents a day)."
5,Paper Shredeer Oil & Lubricant,"Fellowes Powershred Shredder Oil & Lubricant works like a charm. It lubricates the paper shredder so well, it decrease the noise of shredding paper in half.I burnt through two shredders in two years, before I started using this lubricant. My machine is now working fine, and I'm sure with regular use of the lubricant, I will get more than one year's use from my new paper shredder."
5,Fellowes Shedder Oil,"Oil is Oil, I use it in the shredder once a month. This should keep my shredder working well. Thanks"
4,"wow, it's huge!","I thought this would be a small bottle of oil for my paper shredder. I think it's a lifetime supply for home use. ends up, this is a real bargain."
3,Fellowes Shredder Oid,It's just oil . How much praise can a person give to a bottle of Oil. It's in a nice bottle and the oil comes out when the bottle is squeezed.
4,shred,Love the quiet! It dose jam more than I would like and it is to be jam proof. But I really like it!
4,DO NOT CUT THE NOZZLE!!!,Product works as advertised. USE A PUSH-PIN OR THUMBTACK TO PIERCE THE NOZZLE. Do not cut the tip with scissors else you will be squirting oil all over the shredder!
4,Keep your shredder going.,Not many folks realize that paper shredders should be oiled! Adding a few drops of oil before starting a large job will ensure your shredder keeps working for years to come. For infrequent shredding put a couple drops on the cutter once a week or so and run it. My shredder is going strong after 5 years of abuse and I am sure the regular oiling of the shredder has helped keep it going.
4,Fellows Powershred Lubrication,Lubricant seems fine although I discovered that you can also use a vegetable based cooking oil and get the same results for a lot less money.
3,Does The Job But So Does Vegetable Oil For Less,My last shredder died because I used 3 in 1 oil instead of the correct type of oil. I thought I'd play it safe by buying the one recommended for my new Fellowes Powershredder. I was a little disappointed to find out that vegetable oil will work just as well. It even says so in the shredder documentation. I think the bottle could have been designed a little better to control the amount of oil you use and to not be as messy but it does the job and my shredder is running beautifully.
4,Fellows SB-97Cs Shredder,"The first unit I received was DOA. It insisted that the paper bin was full even when it was empty. There's an electronic (optical)sensor system that was either out of whack or just bad.I called Fellows and customer service was excellent. They replaced the unit immediately, e-mailed me an RA and UPS label and I shipped the original back on their ""nickel"". This one works well."
5,greasing the wheels,Perfect size and price to keep the jaws of shredding alive and eating documents. It comes in a perfect size and price for our home office use.
3,Bought this to hopefully improve performance of shredder,"Not sure if it is actually helping anything yet... probably have to wait a year or more to see if it is helping. There are not much instructions except ""apply oil across entry""."
5,Works as advertised,"Picked this up in hopes of prolonging the life of my recently-acquired shredder. Nozzle makes it easy to direct the fluid where it needs to go. Instead of cutting the tip off, I simply used a paper clip to poke a small hole in the end; provides a perfect amount of flow for what I like.Not much else to say; it's a lubricant that seems to do a good job lubricating."
5,Excellent product,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions, I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly. Every time I empty the waste bucket, I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters, and run them forward and reverse. So far, my latest shredder is running smooth as silk, with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good, no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters. And a little bit goes a long way."
2,"Overpriced and awkward, buy a container and vegetable oil!","I purchased this with my shredder, a Fellowes 32177 Powershred PS-77Cs. The bottle is kind of unwieldy, as the nozzle hole is quite big for oil (and it will just spill out). The bottle is pretty big, about 8-10 inches tall so I will have this for a long time, even after using this every time the bag has been changed (recommended by Fellowes).Since this is just pre-packaged and labeled vegetable oil I will use that in the future in an empty old-style ketchup bottle. I would recommend buying a container for vegetable oil and using that instead. Be a smart consumer and save your money!"
3,MSDS,"Google the Material Data Safety Sheet (MSDS), it's Canola Oil that is available at your local super market at a fraction of the cost."
3,Mheh...,"Turns out you can use any light-viscosity vegetable oil with the same results for a lot less cash. It's a fine product, alright, but chances are good you already have what you need in your kitchen pantry: Just drizzle a few drops onto a sheet of paper, run it through, and you're good to go for a month."
1,Not compatible with the Royal 160MX,"Amazon says other customers ordered this with the Royal 160MX, but the Royal manual says do not use petroleum-based lubricants. I'm giving mine away. It DID arrive really quickly, though."
3,LELANDL,"even though the company said the shredder i bought could be used with cooking oil as a lubricant, I decided to buy this product instead. I haven't had to use it yet so I can't really give that thorough of a review."
1,Whyyyy???!!!,"I didnt buy this, the office manger did...or soon to be fired office manager, she is annoying anyway. We have 10 different types of lubricants in the warehouse and even at home that would have sufficed. I have used 3 in 1 oil or Houdini lock and mechanism cleaner for years. I have used both depends which one I can find first. Used on the same shredder for 8 years and it all worked fine until missy know it all ordered this crap. I guess people that justify this price dont mind $4 gas either."
4,Great for keeping paper shredders working well!,"The Fellowes Shredder Oil is recommended for paper shredders to help keep the shredding mechanism lubricated and working well. Keeping the shredding mechanism lubricated prevents the parts from drying out and should help your shredder last longer. Instead of dropping the oil right into the paper insert and creating an oily mess, I just put the shredder oil on a sheet of paper, then put that piece through the shredder. You can also put that piece of paper between 2 other pieces of paper that need to go through the shredder. I wish I knew about this oil before my last shredder broke down! Some people use vegetable oil instead of this Fellowes Shredder Oil, but I have heard vegetable oil can turn and become rancid and smell up your shredder. Fellowes is the recommended oil for paper shredders!"
3,Probably more of a 3.5...,Fellowes 32057 Powershred P-57Cs ShredderThis shredder is good enough for the home/small office. Make sure to buy the lubricant though. I used it for a few days w/ out the lube and it was struggling after about 4 pages. Worked much better post-lubrication. The pieces of paper were a bit longer than I was hoping for but it does meet my information security concerns.
5,works,"need to many words to rate this, as it is a lubricant and it will take a long time to see any beneifit from it"
4,Enjoyable and Quick ...But,"If you are a regular ""Factor"" viewer, there is really not much new here. The most interesting info was about Bill's career at CBS as the backdrop for his Dan Rather interview. Still, it is an enjoyable, quick read."
4,Honesty Can You In Hot Water,"O'Reilly's No Spin Zone is not for people who wallow in (...) and outright lies. It is a book for honest and out spoken people. If you have problems being a No Spinner Mr.O will show you the way! Honesty can get you in hot water, but you need hot water to wash away the grime of spin. This is a book I would recommend to all."
3,Nothing New,"This book is nice reading for people who don't watch Bill's show. But otherwise, it's just a review of what he has already talked about. The comments about different entertainers and politicians at the back of the book really bored me. I'll stick to watching Bill on TV."
4,Not a Fan But . . .,"I have to say up front that I am not a fan of Mr. O'Reilly. I feel he has become too much in love with who he perceives himself to be and takes himself way too seriously. I would prefer to see the old O'Reilly back. But, having said that, this was an interesting read. I was curious about how the ""celebrities"" he approached would respond to his questions and wasn't disappointed."
1,Excrement Eater,"Bill O' Reilly eats excrement, end of story. I haven't even read this book but the excerpts are so biased, hypocritical, and unintelligent that they already make me want to snap his neck and take a piss down his esophagus."
1,o'reilly,If his book is anything like his radio program i say lets take them all and put them to good use as liners for litter boxes.
5,Even Better Than His Last Bestseller!,"This is a great book - well-written, well-paced, entertaining, thoughtful, and thought-provoking. I enjoyed it even more than ""The O'Reilly Factor"" because it hones in so well on public policy issues of continuing national significance, though the two books together provide a more comprehensive view of the man and his ideas. The book's approach - using guest comments as a launching pad - perfectly fits O'Reilly and the impatient reader, and looks as if it can easily be the structure for many a future O'Reilly non-fiction book. If there's any justice in the world, ""No-Spin Zone"" will do even better in the marketplace than ""The O'Reilly Factor."""
1,O'Reilly is a hypocrite.,"All you have to do to realize how much of a lying hypocrite Bill is is to read the chapter about him in Al Franken's book. First he claimed to have won awards he did not, and then he tried to lie to cover it up. He pretends to be on some high moral plane when he is more lowly than the people he despises."
1,A sad sad book,written by a sad sad man. I only gave it one star because Amazon required that some amount of stars be given. In my own scale this book does not even deserve consideration of stars or any mention at all. I mention it here just to save you some time. Don't waste it on this poorly written dribble. O'Reilly is a very sad man in desperate need of therapy.
5,no spin zone,Bill wrote a great book.No Spine Zone was terrific.My grandma read it to me and explained and answered my questions.Thanks Bill for a great book.
1,O'Reilly has never met a half truth he didn't like,"Bill O'Reilly is only popular because there is an audience out there that thinks their government cares about them and would do them no harm, that our biggest problem is that the Ten Commandments aren't posted in schools, and that if only the good ole GOP were allowed to run the government, by God we wouldn't have all of these problems (I borrowing from Trent Lott here). Enough of my ranting, this book is the same as the show, in fact there are no new points here. O' Reilly's list of lies and half truths are too numerous to name here. Save your money, buy a good book like Age of Reason by Thomas Paine or the grand daddy of them all Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith."
1,Propeller Zone!!,"I'm not sure how O'Reilly got to be the King of ""No Spin"". Anyone who has the time (like me) can do a little research on the internet or your local library to see that a lot of the statistics he quotes on his shows are absolutely incorrect. I though ""No Spin"" meant not adding your own twist to anything. I am either naive or very stupid but I think the way he conducts his shows and the way he's written this book can hardly be called unbiased or objective!"
1,Ode to the Vast Right Wing Consirpacy,"This book should be titled ""Spinning for Right Wing Conservatives."" O'Reilly's preaching to the choir and the only people who are likely to be impressed are those already convinced, those who come from the same environment and background or believe that if everyone thought like him, the world would be perfect for them.While O'Reilly claims the book is as a dialogue with his critics,... he has (instead) taken those snippets from his interviews which are most supportive of the point he wants to make. He then introduces those snippets with his own spin and concludes each chapter with more of his spin, all designed to prove his point and undercut his opponents position.His best interview was with Hllary Clinton. She gave him the answers he deserved. let the spinners grind themselves into the ground, and people like you, me and the rest of the honest Americans travel on solid ground into the future!"
5,Another A+ for O-Reilly,"Full of insightful information. Even when his critics are quite harsh, he shares positive statements about them as well as offering his perspective on the matter. Highly recommended, but only conservatives will enjoy it. Secular progressives will use it to take quotes out of context and spin them to use against him. Typical M.O. of S-P's."
2,"""The No Spin Zone,"" Who's he kidding?","The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""Spin"" as ""a favourable bias or slant given to a news story."" Hmmm, Sound familiar? According to O'Reilly, ""Spin"" is to ""spin a lie"" or untruth. I leave it up to the reader to decide which definition is correct.I gave the book 2 stars for the interesting personalities thatO'Reilly talks about.By the way, Mr. O'Reilly, who's looking out for me? Al Franken, that's who!!!!!!"
1,Worst Book Ever,Bill O'Reilly is the biggest hypocrite that has ever lived. He makes baby Jesus cry. Shame on you Bill.
1,Face it - O'Reilly is a jerk,"The intelligent conservatives I know are embarrassed by people like O'Reilley. Before extreme partisanship flared back up in America, I knew few people on either side who even cared much about him (except for the extremists). Now the average conservative is drawn to people like him? Give me a break. I only read part of this book, I will admit, and it exuded the same unstoppable arrogance and closed-mindedness as he does on his show.Note: I am not a liberal, in fact, I voted for Bush in the last election (but regret it now, seeing how he's poorly handled the issues that have come upon him)."
1,What a fruit,Bill O'Reilly is a giant waste of skin. It's about time people tell him to shutup by not buying his book or watching his sorry excuse for a news program. Shut up Bill O'Reilly.
1,Terrible,"I have read this book from cover to cover, and I got as many laughs out of reading it as George Bush's speech writer must get from putting ""misunderestimated"" in GWB's speeches.One of the few positive reviews was this one""This book is a shining example of how most america does not understand the genious of that of bill o'rielly. not only is this book fascinating and informative,it is an expample of what us white supremiscits need. I know that all the other KKK members in our area around here in alabama have all read it and enjoyed it.""Okay, so let me get this straight, we are supposed to buy a book because it is well reviewed by a member of the ku klux klan and Bill O'Reilly 1000 times under different names.Well, I must say it is quite a read, although I would not reccomend it for those with a weak heart; this book is painful to the eyes, and may cause serious damage to the internal organs such as the brain."
2,I have a more appropriate title for this book,"It should be called ""The Nobody Else's Spin but O'Reilly's Zone"". What I find comical about Bill O'Reilly is that he claims that his show is free of spin, then proceeds to put his spin on current events. News flash for everyone, that is what pundits do, they put their own spin on the news. He gets one more star because, love him or hate him, he does have guts and he stands up for what he believes. However, I would like him a lot better if he would come off of his claim that he is independent, and reports the news with no spin. Both claims are bogus. Don't be fooled into expecting this book to be a bipartisan account of things. It is merely conservative pundit Bill O'Reilly telling you his opinions, nothing more."
1,maddox was right O'Reilly is a big blubbering vagina,"this book was nothing but crap, and i'd like to use an S word but luckily amazon.com wont publish it. anyways i think anybody except diehard mentally ill republicans would think this book is worthy of burning. it is pure filth i'm ashamed i read it and i'd just like to call bill o'reilly the name he calls many people expecting it to be the end all be all of insults. you ideologue."
1,Bill is a piece of crap,"Bill O'Reilly is a racist, ignorant, selfish, rude, blubbering, whinning, homophobic, discriminatory piece of mouse crap. DER DER, his books suck, just like he does. He is the epitome of""ridiculous"" people in the US. Oh, and to the 1st reviewer, here's a hint, the ""anti Bush youth"" that you love to pull out your soapbox to speak of, yeah, thats because many people actually DONT WATCH FOX, FOX IS THE MOST BIASED UN-NEWS ""News station"". Fair and balanced, yeah right, maybe if you are in the KLAN...I don't understand why people think O'Reilly is so great, he's a piece of crap, I spit on his work."
1,Worst Book Ever.... and i mean it.,"Im sorry. I've watched his show and saw how he acts. I've read the dialouges of his interview he doesnt show (like the one where he rips a 9/11 family member for not being for the war in iraq) but never in my life did i think id actualy regrett reading. I barrowed this from the local library and read it. To my shock i found that this man is truly what he calls anyone with out his view point. Un-American. He wants to take away your right to free speech if you dont agree. Im sorry Billy boy. No sale here. If i had bought this book, the only joy i would get would be to burn it."
3,As good as the show.,"If you enjoy The O'Reilly Factor entertainment news show on Fox as much as I do, then you'll like this book. It reads just like a transcript of the show (or, at least, like the Talking Points segment). O'Reilly is good at cutting through the bull and presenting the main arguments. Sometimes he falls into generalities and a little spin-doctoring (failing at his own 'No-Spin' gimmick), but it's all in good fun. I was only sad that the book was so short!"
2,"I love O'Reilly, But....","I really love the O'Reilly Factor, but this book really doesn't meet the high standards of the no spin zone. It seems as if the publisher called Bill up and said, ""Hey, we need another million, write another book!"" Seriously, buy his first book and read it...it was GREAT. This one...come on Bill, I know you read these, you can do better. This is just a summary of the show and transcripts. This book just may be ridiculous! ;)"
4,Bill is Great,"I watch ""No Spin Zone"" on TV most evenings and enjoy Bill and his no nonsense interviews. I've recommended this book to 3 people already. It is a quick read and worth your time."
4,A Liberal Review,"Those who disliked the book recommend it for the discount tables. However, why would anyone take the advice of someone who frequents discount tables? I hope these self anointed, pseudo intellectuals never go away. We need to be reminded of the type of people that put us in the world environment we have today. It's a good read!"
5,"Entertaining knowledge, what could be better?","If your time is limited, and you don't get much of a chance to follow current events, politics and public opinion, read this book. This is a 'pithy' quick-read crash course on what's going on, with debates from both side of the fence. Guaranteed to help you decide where you stand on many issues with excellently phrased questions and precise and clear answers (at least from Mr. O'Reilly!). Worth every penny, and every detailed paragraph. Well Done, Mr. O'Reilly!!!"
3,Who is a bigger blowhard Maddox or Bill O'Reilly??,Bill O'Reilly waste of paperMaddox waste of bandwidth
1,The Most Stupid Book,"even thou he attacks hip hop saying that it raps about groping women and treating women like objets, bill o' reilly is being hipporcillal in his book do not tresspass or what ever its called referring to his 1998 so called suspense thriller he says ""ashley was now wearing only brief panties. she has signaled her desire by removing her shirt and skirt and so on....."" in his books he talks about so called fisting. i think we have a hipporcite here."
2,O'Reilly's No Spin Zone....,I thought his book was very contraversial but he believed very strongly in his views. So much that he believed that he was always right. Throughout his book he goes on interviewing many different famouse people which I found to be very interesting.
3,Pete and Repeat,"Most of this is not new, but really an extension of his first book. Mildly entertaining."
1,"Thought provoking, yet hypocritical","My main qualm with this book is how the author claims he is simply expressing his opinion, and says that each person is entitled to his opinion, however he will then slam you in the face (figuratevly speaking, did I spell that right) that his opinions are right, and that it does not matter what others think. He never will flat out say it, but he will make it clear that he does not care about other people's opinions and that the only right person is himself."
1,Worse than I thought,This book is total hypocracy O'reily works for Rupert Murdoch and fox news. How can he possibly know anything about not being Powerful and infamous? He is a slanderer for the right wing. This book makes him look like he is for the average joe in truth he has an alterior agenda. I would say read Al Frankens Liars a fair and balanced look at the right to help get you back in balance after reading this.
1,Cry me a river..,"Geez I wonder if it possible to not give a crap about Maddox and still think B.O. is a boring hypocrite. Self absorbed a-hole. I read the book...know exactly how to spell....could not care less about Maddox.Bill is still an an ass, and this book still sucks."
1,Trying to give this garbage less than one star.,"To those who have said ""O'Reilly leans slightly to the right"". Oh really? Than what is the far right to you? That thought scares me. O'Reilly is the epitome of the neo-conservative movement. You only have to see that people who purchased this garbage also bought titles by the following: Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, and Sean Hannity. O'Reilly's a moron who makes money off of simple minds."
1,Definately Unbalanced,"The arguments in his book, though well structured, are HIGHLY biased, largely by his neoconservatism. They rely too much on made-up facts. And once those are cleared up by consulting dependable sources (i.e. not FAUX news), they are seen for the nutcase arguments they are. O'Reilly is hypocritical and unreliable, and I literally threw the book in the trash after I read it."
1,NO!,"The only serious five star review I have found for this book was from a freshman in Highschool who liked to ""cite"" the book in her political arguments. If I was this dumbasses teacher I would fail them for using an unfactual source. O'reilly is the worse thing since Limbaugh, but at least Rush admitted his show was entertainment. O'reilly refuses to admit that his running monologues (disguised as interviews and reports) are thick in generalizations, distorted fact, and exageration. Do this country a favor, instead of buying this book give the twenty bucks to a third party canidate, any third party canidate."
1,"Hypocrisy, ain't it cool?","This man is simply a hypocrite. He claims to want everyone to find themselves and choose for themselves, yet will dictate to them how to do so. It's like the concept of a self help book, how do you ""help yourself"", yet you're reading how to do so from someone else.Also, those hardline a-holes (I'd go for the gold, but hey, it's Amazon) here on Amazon trashing Maddox. Consider this, Maddox generate thousands of hits a day to his site, yet he has no advertising whatsoever on his site. He makes no profit from the website itself. Moving on, the broad assumption that Maddox readers are unintelligent and will do nothing in life, heh, that's a laugh. I had no idea I was an idiot, I mean, you guys must be blessed to be following a man who contradicts himself on a consistent basis like Billy boy...oh, well...probably the same people who think Bush can do no wrong."
1,KABOOOM!,"You knew this clown was like Mount St. Helens about to blow.Now it's happened. Kaboom! I am already enjoying watching you suffer through the humiliating accusations. Another (very) creepy conservative bites the dust over sexual deviance. Wave career bye byes creepy, creepy conservative clown."
1,Extremism can promote moderate viewpoints over time.,"Bill O'Reilly is just another right wing extremist, encouraging everyone to shut down thier brain and follow the herd. As frustrating it is to see him snarling and spouting off his overly simplistic conservative views, his diatribes often send a message to the average person of how not to act. The average Joe sees O'Reilly acting irrationally and grasping at straws to convey his weak viewpoint and makes a choice to be more moderate. As for his book, it's the same dribble you can see on his T.V. show and the only good part of it is the end. I'd much rather gouge out my eyes with red hot tweezers than read this book again."
3,The same as the TV show !,"Nothing new!It covers the same topics as the first book did and the show covers. So whats the point of the book? Yes it does provide some comments from people that don't agree with him or his stance,yes it is a little short to spend money that could be spent on something else."
5,hits the nail on the head,"Bill O'reilly hits the nail on the head over and over and over in this book. The average hard working american usually doesn't have the time to research and investigate everything that our politicians say and do. We depend on our journalist to report facts and not liberal spin. If it wasn't for books like ""No-Spin Zone"", many people who rely on the mainstream press and major networks for their news, wouldn't have a clue of whats true or what is ""SPIN""."
1,He can't be serious,"This book wasn't supposed to be taken seriously, right? In a word, turgid. O'Reilly fans will need to look that one up."
1,O'Reilly Bingo Rules!,"The show sucks, and according to Maddox, so does this book. However, I highly recommend Bill O'Reilly Bingo, which can be found at http://maddox.xmission.com/ The only useful purpose I can think of for this book is to tear out the pages, feed them into your printer, and print O'Reilly Bingo on them. Then again, that's pretty expensive printer paper. The obvious conclussion: don't buy this book."
1,rehash,"If you've never seen ""The O'Reilly Factor"" show or if you're an infrequent viewer, then I'd have to give the book 5 stars.If you're a huge fan of ""The O'Reilly Factor"", like I am, then you don't need to buy this book. 90% of the material is straight from the show. The other 10% is commentary interwoven to tie things all together. For me, this book was somewhat of a waste of time and money. This book was not written with the ""Fan"" in mind."
1,get over it,"Jesus christ, get over it. People (including me) are maddox slaves. You are obviously going to get this stuff if he puts up something about it. So stop bitching, write your review and get on with your life."
1,Horrible,"Holy crap this is pathetic, save yourself a good 20 dollars for something useful. This piece of crap isn't worth the paper is made of. Bill O'Rilley blows, anyone who states otherwise should go stick their head in an oven right now. Boycott that moron Bill. DON'T READ THIS!!"
2,A Fan Says: Don't Bother,"I was a rather disappointed with _The No Spin Zone_. As a fan of The O'Reilly Factor for the past few years, most of the interviews and issues were old hat to me. (In contrast, O'Reilly's earlier book, the semi-memoir _The O'Reilly Factor_, was a far more fascinating read.) Both O'Reilly's greatest faults and strengths shine though in this new book. His anti-conceptualism is apparent in his contradictory ideas, like his stance on drugs versus alcohol. But the honesty, forthrightness, and dogged pursuit of the truth that make his show worth watching are also evident. So here's my advice: For those who are already failiar with O'Reilly's show, don't bother with this book. For those that are not, don't bother with this book either -- but do check out his show instead."
1,Utter BS,"Beginning with the title, this book is NOTHING BUT SPIN. If I wanted to teach a class on ethics in news reporting I would use this book as an example of how to fill every story with personal bias while leaving the truth out in the cold for a true journalist to find. O'Reilly should be ashamed of himself."
1,The Truth,Anything by Bill O'Reilly is an automatic piece of garbage. He isn't capable of writing (?) anything else. He is too self-centered to actually focus an another subject to produce a book.
3,Assumptions,"This is for the people who don't understand. Maddox has not said ""Go forth my flying monkey minions and place moronic quips about someones book."". For those who care to read the article he states to simply to read the reviews of the book. But then, I guess if you bother defending tripe from a man who would rather pretend to be part of the ""working class"". Then actually get down, and see how jobs in the manufacturing sector have fled the US in record pace. Decimating American communities and destroying American families. He'd be able to have a firm grasp on reality and a more respected member of the media. Instead of spouting half truths and skewed statistics to further his causes.So i ask you, who's the patriot...?"
1,O'Reilly is dangerous,"Bill has a good show, I will give him that. But he is a demagogue of the worst kind. He professes to be spin free and surmounts power on that premise. He knows that people are fed up with mishaps in Washington and abroad, then he uses that to gain power. He has power because he is able to persuade people to his point of view. One cannot ignore his conservative viewpoint, but it infuriates me when he says he his spin free. I was dizzy after the first chapter! I would be just as upset if a liberal claimed to be spin free and spun left ideology in the name of truth. If you like to be manipulated then read this book, or read it and debunk the rhetoric."
1,No Spin Indeed,"It is amazing this book made it to the best seller list. Its appearance will be brief. This book is just more blather from the king of blather, Mr. Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly fashions himself as the champion of the little man. He is more like the Wizard of OZ, making decrees and hiding behind the curtain. O'Reilly attacks everyone and everything that does not fit his view of the world. I will cede one point to O'Reilly; he does operate in a ""no spin zone"". O'Reilly yammers on endlessly, no one can get a word in, so there is no chance for spin. His attack on Hillary Clinton was unwarranted. Hillary can't help it if she is a heartless shrew who puts her own self interest above all else. She has been married to Bill Clinton for over 20 years, after all. Unless you are an O'Reilly Republican and drank the kool-ade, this book is not for you."
3,O'Reilly at his best,"This book is not as thought provoking as The O'Reilly Factor but it is just as enjoyable to read. It is definetely O'Reilly at his best. He gives excerpts from his hit TV show that are informative, heated, and outright funny. His chapter with James Carville is very interesting; the one with President Bush: informative, and the one with Hillary Clinton: hilarious. You can't help but like this pompous man. He is smart, confident, and best of all he is no-spin. This book will open your eyes to the corruption in Hollywood, politics, and high-society America. And he does all this humorously. Great book."
1,Satan himself,"Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag."
3,O'Reilly's Book,"After I finished the book, I was suprised at how much I liked it. The book wasn't the best book I've read but O'Reilly's witty humor made the book enjoyable. The book consists of interviews conducted by O'Reilly with the interviewee's being celebrities. O'Reilly is extremely blunt and gets right to the point. The point most of the time being to humiliate one by exposing their lies and double standards."
1,HAHAHA,"haha, this is great. Maddox, if you see this, you are trully the most powerful man in the world, and command quite a following.As for O'reilly, I have seen him on TV at one time or another, and he does get annoying. He whines to much for an old guy. he needs to put more research and real facts into his show instead of all the repetitive catch phrases."
1,This is a travesty. First he is on TV and now this.,This is the worst fist chapter (after that it just got to confusing to read due to the lack of thought) I have ever read in my entire life. I tried to skim through the rest of the book but was at a loss for what he was trying to say. It mostly consisted of his whining about the government and why things should be his way. I found a much better review than mine by a very enlightened person. Check it out.(...)
1,worst ever!,This book was positively horrible. This man can't write one sentence without contradicting himself. My IQ went down 5 points after reading the first page of this book. I burned it like the rubbish that it is. Please save yourself the regret.
3,Beh...,"I couldn't care less about the book, it's a mediocre read. What's interesting *here* is another political figure... seems maddox has more than a bit of a cult following. I read his page, but somehow I didn't think his fans were the type to go out into the world and actually DO something. Even so minor as trashing the reviews of a book by a man He didn't like.Anyway, the book is a nice long meandering rant... if you're looking for a good alternate media source, watch an hour of CNN then read a chapter of some Micheal Moore. I think you'll find that's a much more informative activity."
1,"We lie, you believe.","Mr. O'Reilly has once again proven that the ability to scream on a tv show does not translate to any type of journalistic or literary ability. I found the book lacking both facts and style, leaving only O'Reilly's dull and combative personality. I am dumber for having read it."
1,Hmm...,"Yeah, most of the above reviews are true. Maddox rules! Haha, how sad, I'm supposed to be writing a review about Bill O'Reilly's book... oh well. I have no intention of reading it. I'll just keep reading Maddox's articles."
1,Naked ignorance in-search of a cause.,"I relented. I purchased the book of the TV-Show. What a horrid mistake, I wish I had the t-shirt.Mr. O'Reilly has managed, I assume through a series of lucky sound-bites and greedy media producers, to establish himself as a commentator of some import; and with 25 years to do it, his fame comes late for his ascribed ‘talent’.Sadly, Mr. O'Reilly has managed to wield his unique journalistic crayon yet again, transcribing comments from his luckless interviewees and (turning) them into a tawdry pastiche, loosely disguised as a 2nd Grade term paper.I have placed my copy in the bathroom, atop the commode, in the hope that my guests will find a use for it.If you must read it, do so understanding that Mr. O’Reilly, really has nothing to say; until someone disagrees with him, at which point they are either ‘…anti-American, stupid or a democrat…’."
1,Are the only SPINNERS on the left and moderate?,Does Mr O'Reilly ever take on Conservatives? This is book is about one thing and one thing only.....making Mr O'Reilly rich.
1,No spin? Not unlike a gyroscope!,"No spin? Reading this, I felt like I drank a gallon of vodka and rode on a roller coaster for 2 hours.Predictable results!"
1,Worste book ever.,I want money back for wasting my time reading this filth. He is the king of spin in this book.
4,"He's got 'em in the crosshairs, a one sided encounter","Bill O'Reilly is givng the major networks fits and they deserve every spasm. In this tomelette he gives us a recounting of his interviews with various celebrities and notables in addition to some of his inside observations when they weren't on camera.He's a straight ahead stand-up-guy who brooks no nonsense from the spinners who have been given a major pass for years by the religious Left; those who have dominated the desimination of information for the past 50 years. His show is a pleasure to watch, particularly for those of us who believe in individual liberty and the protection of private property rights that our constitution prescribes.This book is a quick read and certainly worth the time. Hooray for Bill and may many others follow in his footsteps."
1,"The SPIN of the ""No Spin Zone""",""" Credibility is like virginity, you can only lose it once""hey Billy your book(and show)is a brothel of the truth!This guy does not even know what party he belongs too...can you take him for his word-I hope for America's sake, no.Save Your Money-don't buy this book"
1,Refrain from purchasing,"This book has managed to accomplish one thing, it creates in the reader an insurmountable disgust and passionate hatred of the sort of shameless and factless rhetoric employed my Mr. O'Reilly. Anyone who struggles with mindless filth should NOT purchase this book. Book like this exploit the less educated members of society with mindless hollow rhetorical nonsense; which, manages to excite, but when analyzed for conceptual consistency and truth one comes up short. O'reilly generalizes and spin's like no other in his little ""no-spin"" zone. It amazes me that such patently false propaganda like ""no-spin zone"" and ""fair and balanced"" can be used without an uproar. Fox is by far the most right mainstream media outlet and O'reilly is the most conservative member. Not to mention the fact that the place where the most spin on tv occurs is O'reilly's show. Amazing truly amazing....."
4,Not much new ground covered,"If you're a fan of O'Reilly's show, most of this book will be redundant since it contains interviews taken straight from the show. If not yet a fan, you'll probably find it interesting and entertaining. ""The O'Reilly Factor: The Good The Bad and the Completely Ridiculous."" surpasses this one on the content scale."
2,The author likes his work more than I do.,"I had never heard of Bill O'Reilly before, so I bought the book because the subject matter sounded interesting, and I thought it would give me a quick insight into this popular personality. He has some interesting stories about his interviews with famous people, but what surprised me the most was how he prefaced every story with how dramatic and insightful his questions were, but yet the stories frequently turned out to be rather bland and ordinary. This guy obviously is in love with himself, and greatly over-values his interviewing ability, but I have to give him credit for attacking the B.S. spun by cynical public figures. We desperately need guys like this - I just wish he'd let his Press Agent do the patting on the back. For a guy who so vehemently attacks the the ""spin zone"" of public figures, he does a significant amount of web-spinning around his own performance."
3,Falls a Little Short,"I loved the first book and pre-ordered this one months in advance. While I did enjoy it, I agree with some of the other reviewers that thought it fell a little short. As someone who is not an avid reader, I do appreciate the quick and easy read, however it didn't provide much of anything beyond what regular viewers already know. I would like to see Bill wait a few more years and do a larger compendium release with a whole cross-section of interviews instead of a mere handful of the most popular with a few quick comments. I'd love to know what goes on behind the scenes and some of the conversations off-camera. Not a bad book, but not quite up to expectations either. On another note, I feel sorry for some of the ""reviewers"" on here who are so filled with hatred. Maybe they should stick with Oprah's Book Club. Have they nothing better to do?"
2,Snoozer,"Sorry Bill, I like your show but this book a real snoozer. Nothing really new here. Now -- on to a real entertaining book, Harry Potter."
1,O'Reilly needs to be brutally sodomized,"I really didn't read the book, but judging by O'Reilly's ""ridiculous"" self-exalting, narcissistic tirade on television, it's another load of steaming elephant crap. There is no other thought more comforting than thinking that someday he will be horribly violated by some large schizophrenic in an asylum. Well Bill, the only one who is a goddamn idealogue is you, you sniveling piece of animal waste. You should be drawn and quarted, burned, defecated upon, jumped up and down on, and then called an ""idealogue"" until you've had enough. There is no cure for people like you O'Reilly, you're like cancer, and should have been culled at birth."
1,A waste of trees,"This book is the literary equivalent to Anna Kournikova's ""tennis"" in the sense that it looks like a book and feels like a book but has absolutely no value whatsoever. O'Reilly goes off on self-promoting tirades and reverts to narcissistic strongarming in order to get his point across. His show is an example of television going downhill and his book is only weighing down the literary world. He himself is a waste of oxygen."
1,An excellent argument for abortion - namely O'reilly's,"After reading this book, I fully support investing more money into time travel. I believe we should go back in time and prevent this travesty at all costs.Also, this book gave me cancer."
1,"Why isn't their a ""trash"" rating?","Bill O'Reilly is simply an egotistical whiner and should really sit down to self-evaluate his personality (oh wait, he doesn't know how to, but he has the nerve to tell all Americans they should).I for one am not buying into his useless diatribe and if you don't like what I have to say about you Bill, well that's too bad. Shall I introduce you to the first amendment?"
2,I'm not an O'Reilly fan but...,"You thought I was going to say I like this book? C'mon! I read some of this book, a friend loaned it to me and he's an O'Rilley fan. I don't like O'reilly not for his politics, but just because he is a very poor interviewer. We all know his style, yell, intimidate, belittle etc. etc. etc. If you watch the Charlie Rose show with O'Reilly on as a guest, Rose tears him up and spits poor ol' Bill out. Rose knows how to interview! Besides, we need Bill to tell us Sean Combs is an egotistical idiot? Please... Read this book if you want, but it won't tell you anything you didn't know already."
1,"Worst book ever, this shouldn't even have got 1 star","This book honestly really is horrible. But people are stubborn and close minded to realize how bad it really is. This guy is a total moron, if someone brings him down he says they are ""unpatriotic"" and ""betraying their country"" this isn't even a fair trial kind of a thing. This is Bill talking about his thoughts and feelings and not giving anyone a chance or else they are ""unpatriotic"". If you really want to know my honest opinion and probably the majority of the people who AREN'T close-minded would of agree with me on this one, this book is horrible."
1,Ole Billy Boy is at it again!,"If you are an easily led moron, you may get a few chuckles out of this sorry excuse of a book. Billy boy basically regurgitates the popular opinions of the rest of conservative America. If you've heard Bush's most recent State of the Union address, then you are already familiar with the mindless, elite driven doggerel that exudes from the mouths of people like ole Billy boy. This book is worthless, it nearly caused the fire to go out in my woodstove when I tossed it in there. Just kidding, I actually didn't buy this piece of uninspiring propoganda. I don't know who in their right mind would even consider buying this worthless waste of a good tree. At least his radio show is only polluting the airwaves. I have some advice for ole Billy boy: Save the trees for Vonnegut's books, you suck."
1,Oh my god,"This is so horrible they should use it in interrogations at guantanamo and iraq with an arabic interpreter and those guys would break in seconds. Seriously I was amazed when I read this book. As an avid humanitarian, my very foundations were shook to the core and I actually went into isolation for a couple of weeks. I didnt know what to think, what to do. I thought ""how can I go outside and socialise with strangers when there are people like Bill O'Reilly out there?"" Thankfully I found a good therapist and I am slowly regaining my faith in humanity. Whatever you do dont buy this book, unless possibly as a gift for someone you really hate."
1,"WHAT GREAT ""NEW"" IDEAS (in caps lock)","-Wow, this book is the best thing since the most powerfull men in the media started complaining about who controls the media.-The narcissism is addicting!-Mr. O'Reilly's grade is actually less than one star."
1,"If you were looking for crap, buy this book.","That's right, this is the biggest waste of $4.50 (for a used copy) that amazon.com has to offer. Look no further tird hunters, you have found your prey. If you can get through the first chapter without laughing outloud at Bill's stupidity and crass generalization, you won't make it through the second unless you are a total dolt and have no ability to think for yourself. If you have any self respect, don't waste your money on this rag."
1,Horrible!,"What a waste of paper.... do yourself a favor and spend your money on some ice cream, itll leave a better taste in your mouth!"
1,Big Blubbering Bill,"I wasted my life reading this book, it is uninteresting and dull.maddox describes Bill's book best in this quote,"" there's a quote in it saying ""in order to be truly successful you have to be brutally honest with yourself. Excuses and rationalizations have to be put aside. You must define your own life,"" continuing with the definition he's giving you for your life ""[and] not let others do it for you."" Wow, thanks Bill! You condescending son of a b****. As if he wasn't already a giant self-collapsing vortex of hypocrisy, there are literally thousands of other examples I could cite of him ""defining"" people's lives. For example, regarding people who support Michael Jackson, he said ""all Americans should remain on the sidelines and watch the process."" Oh really? Does that include you, Bill? Or are broad sweeping generalizations about what ""Americans should do"" inapplicable to you? ""Dont Buy this book!"
5,Great insights on the issues of our society today,"I really enjoyed this book. I think that it is really interesting because it deals with controversial problems that are present in our current lives. Author Bill O'Reilly provides his thoughts on the certain inssues, but also allows an opposing voice to draw out their perspectives. As you take into consideration the two very different opinions, it really makes you think about what you, as an individual, believe in. I don't always agree with O'Reilly's take on the matters, but I think it is great the way he exposes the problems that people are dealing with in our society."
1,COMMENT,"Included in the list of those who bought O'Reilly's book, is thename ""Barbara Olsen"", the deceased wife of Ted Olsen, who diedin the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11. Yes, Bill's latest book ""The No Spin Zone"" is so sought after, that even the dead return to buy it. YEAH,...RIGHT!!!"
3,No-holds-barred advice,"Bill O'Reilly reminds of Michael Moore in the way that he wants people to know the real truth about what is going on in America. He doesn't shy away from criticizing people in high places, he exposes their lies. Examining sex and violence in the media and the tarnished legacy of the Clintons with the same feistiness as the death penalty (which he opposes) and timid national news organizations that roll over for the powerful. Here he excerpts past interviews with Dr. Laura (on working mothers), former surgeon general Dr. Joycelyn Elders (on sex education), Puff Daddy (on rap), Susan Sarandon (on police brutality) and Al Sharpton (on boycotts). He's seeking the truth and is determined to get it."
4,Excellent!,"O'Reilly is articulate and incisive in this hard-hitting cross exam of several of our supposed leaders in politics and the mass media. A very informative and entertaining read by an intelligent, imposing thinker. Hats off to Mr. O'Reilly."
2,Two stars for trying,"Mr. O'Reilly really does attempt to appear fair. I like his probing questions of powerful and famous people. However, he only throws hard questions to people with liberal ideas while ignoring the right. Once you realize that his heart is just not into probing too deeply anyone who thinks like him all appearances of fairness vanish.""No-spin zone"" name should be ""no-win zone"" for anyone who differs with him. Afterall, he decides what questions to ask and what to put in his book. Waste of someone who could make a difference if he was truly impartial."
4,Pretty good; his other book better,"Whose Looking Out for You?"" was a 5 star book for me and this one is close. Yes, class warfare is alive and Mr. O'Reilly calls it like he sees it. I see it too as a middle class business owner. Don't kid yourself, the rich are running this country and sometimes that is a good thing and sometimes it isn't."
3,Fair and Balanced,"As written:""Bill O'Reilly is just another right wing extremist, encouraging everyone to shut down thier brain and follow the herd.""Sounds like almost any left wing extremist. O'Reilly has anopinion, and he does swing to the right a bit, but to labelhim an extremist is blatantly unfair. If anything he is ahuge self promoter, and he does his fair amount of spinning,regardless of his self-named philosophy. But it really doeslook like a bunch of Maddox's readers come on and slanted thereviews. HINT: Just becuase some one disagrees with you doesn'tmake you an extremist. This is why most of middle Americaloathes the left."
1,A whiner and a crier and borderline illiterate,"I got this book as a gift. I wish I could return it. We need intelligent discourse in this country, not boneheads like Bill O' Reilly who is just out to cash in on his questionable name. As a Republican myself, I find his comments to be generic and unsupported, and his attitude to be smug and irritating. A terrible book by a flunky."
1,no title,"I have tried to listen with open mind of the prating that this author exhorts, but enough is enough. I have heard the ongoings of how the left was taking control of the media and how the left was essentially evil personified, but the only books I see in mass print or shows on t.v. are all hard right. I guess I'm missing something here."
1,Racism,The staggering amount of racism in this book should have gotten it banned from the shelves of bookstores already! This is absolutely horrific! Bill O'Reilly has hammered another nail into his own coffin with this one.
1,Read at your own risk,No spin zone? That is all he does. What a joke you have become. I have stopped watching your show and I hope many others will too. Ron Paul 2012
4,Touches on many important social ills.,"After reading ""Those Who Tresspass"" and ""The O'Reilly Factor"" I knew I had to read this book. As expected, this book lives up to the great work expected from Mr O'Reilly. Its consisely written chapters keep you interested, and seem to build in intensity as the book progresses. The book is written is such a way that you do not have to read cover to cover, but you can if you wish, skip around to different chapters as your interests change; Each chapter is almost like a small social commentary all by itself.Whether you agree with Bill or noy, I'm sure you'll find this book very interesting. Though slightly skewed to his viewpoint, he sill manages to point out good points of the opposing view, and lets you make up your own mind. A definate must read for Bill O'Reilly Fans."
1,"crap, plain and simple","This guy must be the dumbest person in America. Oh wait, ok, GW is dumber, but O'Reilly certainly gives him a run for his money. Blowhard, moron, idiot: that about sums it up."
1,Sucks,"Hey guys! Looks like another sucky book from Mr. Hypocrite himself. It sucks, don't buy it. He talks about these ""issues"" but he himself has become an issue, and a thorn in many sides. What an idiot."
1,well...,I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to?
1,kiss my shiny metal @ss,"never read the book, don't know who this guy is, but if Maddox hates him then so do iall hail king maddox!"
1,Deja vu,"Per normale, O'Reilly spouts forth witless, moronic drivel that would desiccate my cerebral cortex more quickly than would watching bread mold over (e.g., his moaning about that little First Amendment-protected right I like to call freedom of speech). Perhaps that's why his book strikes such a positive chord with a considerable percentage of the populace. I dunno. The book has one use besides maybe toilet paper: a joke book. Just pull a bit from his masterpiece, and voila! instant quip! Your friends, provided they have a scrap of intellect, will be rolling about on the floor! I would burn the book, but I wouldn't want even the gaseous traces of this work to pollute my airways."
4,Prove your point,"...Oreilly is clearly not an extreme right-winger; not any more than Joe Biden is a radical lefty. How can someone who is clearly critical of the Bush administration, the Catholic hierarchy, and Capital punishment be labeled anything but a Centrist. His take on socio-political issues has consistently reflected logic and morality. Never once have I caught him pushing his point based upon ideology or political agendas - NOT ONCE. I challenge anyone to articulate one example of Oreilly playing party politics on ANY issue.The spin stops with Oreilly."
1,Ego Mania times 100,"What Mr. O'Reilly has presented in his text is nothing more than narcissistic self grandiose drivel. His presentation is almost childlike in format. It is quite apparent that Bill is only concerned with his convoluted take on the so called powerful sector of society. I can't help but notice that Mr. O's ego is larger than our national deficit. Trust me when I tell you this individual's popularity is nothing more thhan a current fad. I would love the opportunity to debate this parasitic (...)of an author, and more importantly, human being. (...)"
1,Save your money,"Someone needs to tell O'Reilly that the O'Reilly's were immigrants, as were nearly all of our ancestors. And like most of todays immigrants ours arrived broke, dirty, and not speaking English. As with his show the book is bias and factless. I'd like to see him interview someone like author Clint Borgen on the issue of immigration. He'd be eating his own words. I recommend any book but this."
1,You tools.,Way to go Maddox readers. You're in success when it comes to exploiting a man who KNOWS what he's talking about (Maddox). The sheep in the Maddox herd kill the scene.
3,Impressive none the less........,"I find it personally amazing that Maddox has this much influence over the internet. He pretty much single-handedly turned Amazon's review section about O' Reilly's book into a heated message board arguing over whether or not they like Maddox. There's over 300 posts on this thing, and like two of them are about the book. Regardless if you like Maddox or not, you have to admit that's pretty impressive."
5,No Spin can keep this one from the top of the charts..,CAUTION: This book is not for the spin prone or the weak hearted. Both liberals and conservatives should commend this man for his articulate and passionate arguments on todays most vexing issues. If other books leave you hanging or just plain bored then try this one. Bill O'Reilly is sure to get to the point quick and keep you reading.
1,pooty tang is classy,"maddox...oh yes dear maddox....your cult followers bow down to your cocky remarks and drink your piss like fine wine!!! wooohoooo!! why dont you tell these children to gouge there precious eyes out with spoons?Alas, I like my women greasy, and my men with real hair. Boo Hoo to the man wiht a combover.EAT MEAT."
1,Blowhard spews,"If you like listening to conservatives rant about what is wrong with the world, then this is the book for you. Bill O'Reilly presents his opinions as facts, tries to build a sense of outrage against people that might disagree with him and lets people that disagree with him totally off the hook. Typically, O'Reilly will excoriate Clintons for ""bad behavior"". But in his diatribe against ""youthful indisrections"" never once does he have the courage to put George W Bush and his drunk drivings in his list of ""criminals"". Unfortunately, O'Reilly mixes fact with innuendo with urban legends and outright falsehoods making it difficult to believe him. The book ends up demonizing ""liberals"" which by O'Reilly's definition seems to include everyone to the left of Attila the Hun. Probably a fun read for those who like listening to right wing rant. However, don't expect to learn anything new by reading this book."
4,Enjoyable - but less than I expected.,"You've Got To Love Bill O'Reilly - he who reigns where Spin doesn't enter in. I love to watch the guy force people to focus on substance and leave the rhetoric for the fluff shows. This is exactly why I wanted to read this book - excerpts of interviews with interesting, some would say controversial, people across the political and idealogical spectrum.The interview excerpts WERE interesting & made me wish I had seen the interviews as they aired. What was less than satisfying was how much of the book was the explanation leading up to a couple of pages of dialogue. Frankly, it left me wanting a bit more substance and a lot less fluff. Coming from a guy like Bill O'Reilly, a fluff book is even more disappointing and insulting - you know he would know the difference. Next time I sit down at his table, I hope he serves a little more meat...."
1,Nutspeak,"Orwell would have enjoyed meeting O'Reilly. He had an appreciation for whacko propagandists.As it turns out, not that many people have actually read the O'Reilly tripe. Right wing groups buy O'Reilly's books in bulk and give them to their nuttier followers who then use them for doorstops. They can't read anyway and they believe anything they're told to believe. Even though it's different day to day.Fox encourages these things because it makes people think Fox is important. Remember, although it isn't obvious, Fox doesn't claim O'Reilly is working as a ""journalist"" because they know he's not. He's the host of a zone that doesn't spin, but turns upside down in a twisted House of Mirrors. Nope, for the big news, Fox turned to Geraldo.Bill O'Reilly is today's Big Brother and he's watching you. Creepy."
2,Doesn't Hold a Candle to 'The O'Reilly Factor',"I'm an O'Reilly fan, but I was very disappointed with 'The No Spin Zone'. It just didn't have the bite, clarity, and concision of O'Reilly's first book, 'The O'Reilly Factor'. As I read this I kept coming back to one thought: his publisher really wanted a successful followup book, but O'Reilly couldn't think of a good topic - so he had no topic. Some of the show transcripts included in the book are interesting, but they don't translate well to print since so much of O'Reilly's banter with his guests is about intonation and subtext. My suggestion: buy 'The O'Reilly Factor' and read it a dozen times, and begin watching 'The O'Reilly Factor' on FoxNews whenever possible. And leave 'The No Spin Zone' on the shelf."
1,get a life,"Regardless of the quality of the book, those of you who hate it simply because Maddox did need to get a life and an opinion. You are a disgrace to Maddox and his site. Maddox has intelligence and you're leeching off it pretending it's yours. Stop relying on him to give you opinions and get a life."
1,Bill O'Reilly needs to find a new job,"It's a good thing that our country has freedom of speech even though Bill O'Reilly thinks that it should not. His book is devoid of facts and is nothing more than a nerdy loser whining about problems in America instead of actually doing work to change those very things. Terrible, terrible book. I wouldn't even use the pages for toilet paper. Oh yeah, Maddox rules!"
2,"Redundant for ""Factor fans""","If you're already a regular watcher of the ""O'Reilly Factor"" on Fox News, there isn't much new material offered in this book. Most of it is a rehash of material that's already been featured on his television show. If you watch the show...save your money. If you don't already watch the show, you might find it amusing."
2,Watch the TV Show,"I love Mr. O'Reilly's TV Show, ""The O'Reilly Factor"", and this book is really a printed transcript of his show(s). Nothing new here. Reading transcripts of interviews interspersed with the author's comments is a rather tedious read. If you like O'Reilly's point-of-view (I do), try his other books and watch his show--you can probably skip this book and still clearly understand his message."
1,this book sucks,bill'oreily is a fraud. He is a American Suprimist with a bunch of non college educated yankees trying to get up his all mighty ass. only a truly uneducated person could so so low to insult other as unpartriotic if they do not follow his opinion.
1,He's a jerk.,This guy is a serious jerk. Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent. Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting.
1,MALARKY,If i could give it 0 stars i would. The guys an idiot plain and simple.Maddox was right. Infact he was so right i didnt even read this stupid ass book.Worst book ever. (PERIOD)
3,No value for your dollar here.,"While I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Factor', I was really disappointed by 'The No Spin Zone'. As a regular viewer of 'The Factor' on Fox News Channel, I found I was simply reading transcripts of O'Reilly's show, with a few of his additional opinions sprinkled in. For the money, I'd have rather gone out for a lobster dinner. It would have been far more satisfying."
2,Don't Waste your money,Watch the program but don't read this book. This book is just a summary of years of reporting. The book doesn't hold new substance and is just around to make money.What he does in this book is to show interviews he had with powerful people. The interviews don't look as good on paper. He then criticizes them the same way he does on the program. He goes on and on on the program about these interview so if you watch the show regularly you know what this book is about and will be disappointed not to find something new.
1,Mr. Blue Colar Independent O'Reilly,"I used to watch O'Reilly last year. Suddenly he became the ""independent"", on the fence, blue colar guy. He only thinks of getting more audience by riding the fence. Shame on him!I gave the book to my husband --who is a fan of O'Reilly-- and he could not pass the 1st chapter! O'Reilly seems to loath people who are upper class. Someone would like to buy the book? Anyone? Please..."
1,I'm impressed...a reactionary discovered computers,"This is possibly the most pathetic book ever written. I think a two-year-old could have asked more logical lines of questioning. And has anyone looked at the other books bought by people who bought No Spin Zone? What the hell. I haven't read such anti-liberalism since J. Edgar Hoover and Hitler. Why not just be blatant and admit that the only basis for any of the claims is just that they hate liberals? It's amazing how apparently all liberals are communists, fascists, and anarchists all at the same time, while conservatives are the rightous army of God.I would reccomend this book only to two types of people: people who like to laugh at idiots, and idiots (conservatives).Oh and one more thing...to all the conservatives out there...you can't stop change...deal with it."
1,Dont read,"Bill O'Riley borders on absolute stupidity believing that people would actually enjoy this book. He constantly promotes the book on his show filled with mindless drivel. Much like his views, the mindnumbing hipocracy shines through. To actually enjoy this book you would have to either be such a mindless right-winger as to actually believe what he is saying or be so stupid as to not notice his obviously hipocritic statements. He debases the wealthy media, what does he believe he is? It is this sort of contradiction that shows me that he doesnt even listen to what is coming out of his mouth."
1,"Even as a true conservative, this is junk...","O'Reilly is indeed bitter, angry man. No Spin Zone is one of most lame works I have read in a long time. Books such as this truly show the out of touch and uninformed side of consevative America, I am glad to be a true conservative and not stoop to the level of Mr. O'Reilly."
1,Errrrrrrrggggerggghahbhjshdkg.........,I can still see it when I close my eyes!!! Ahhh! make it stop! for the love of God!
1,Fair and Balanced Review,"Bill O'Reilly is a spin zone. While I have been lightly impressed by his own criticisms of the Bush administration, he fails to live up to the title of his book and tv show. An American who oposses free speach, and chastices rappers and porn stars. If you dont like them dont listen to them or buy their stuff, its that simple. There are freedom loving americans that do listen to them and buy their stuff. Its their right to make it, and our right to buy it, so stop imposing your beliefs on us. Oh and what a hypocrite. You are oposed to drugs and support the drug addict Rush Limbaugh"
1,"Yeah, uh, ok...",One doesn't have to read this to understand that it's only confirming the fact that Bill O'reilly is just regurgitating the same old crap he spits out on his T.V. and radio shows. I've skimmed thru the thing. It's all that was necessary. We're not dealing with the second coming of John Stuart Mill here. Bill O'reilly is a 3rd rate intellect with a second rate personality. Please people.
1,This book is thick of repeating subjects,"As I read the negative reviews, some sound like spitting images from that of Maddox. But guess what, Maddox has the general feeling about this book.My friend lent me this book to read. And no, Maddox's destruction of Bill's character didnt provoke me. It was that of how O'Reilly felt about Rap and his arrogant comments towards rapper Ludacris. Put it this way, Bill O'Reilly is nothing more then a conceided biggot who believes that what he 'feels' is the right way and the only way. And his book is nothing more then a transcript of past crap spat out from his show. But dont get me wrong, this book is good enough for something, evening out my pool table for starters.Should you buy this book? Go right ahead, its a page turner up until page 76. Thats when it becomes a stomach turner. But if curiousity is the best of you, be my guest and destroy your inner child by buying it"
1,KKK are Wearing Three Piece Suits,"The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values."
1,"Wow, Bill. Wow.","I myself am a conservative and an O'Reilly fan, but this book just blows.Bill quit writing and just stick to out-shouting the guests on your show."
1,A monster,"O'Reilly represents everything that's backward and disgusting in America today. The book, however, is not as bad as Coulter's filth."
1,I hope Bill O'Reilly suffers the indignity of public defecation in his pants!,"I couldn't finish reading this trash because I feared the loss of more brain cells, and I value an IQ over 139. I really hope that the masses figure out that Bill O'Reilly is a stupid idiot. He is not fair and balanced, and everything he criticizes becomes a conundrum. i.e. Let's criticize Clinton for having sexual relations with whatever-the-hell her name was, but meanwhile, a few years later, I'll sexually harass my staff. Clinton's was consensual, O'Reilly's was not.For anyone who doesn't like Bill O'Reilly like me, please go to the below link.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=sr_rt_low/102-3971316-7060915?index=stripbooks:relevance-below&field-keywords;=a%20psychoanalyst%20perspective%20on%20operant%20conditioningI also noticed that his book is the only book I've seen selling for one cent, is that a Republican ploy? or because you can't even give this crap away?"
2,"Father forgive me, for I have spinned...","I like Bill O'Reilly, but he really didn't put too much effort into this book. Short and ""pithy"", this book is a one-evening read."
4,Informative,"As an impartial reader I find it rather amusing that most feedback from this site comes from people who haven't read the book in question and are only replying based on the fact that ""Maddox dislikes it."" I didn't realize on Amazon that was a prerequisite for a review, not reading something but taking the words of a egotistical hypocrite as fact.Either way O'Reilly views on his work and the various places it took him were very interesting. Behind the scenes politics and the analysis of varied interviews also gave his book a certain appeal. Would recommend to those that like, and hate, O'Reilly as it gives good perspective on his thoughts."
2,"Good flavor, but too thin","Good flavor, but seems as though something is missing. (maybe some more garlic would help) Also too thin, more like a salsa than enchilada sauce."
3,"A fair portrait of the man, but shaky on the facts","Afraid to say that Weitz's book is littered with errors as regards basic facts of the Nazi era and the inter-war period in general. This won't matter to those who have a good knowledge of the times, but students fresh to the subject should beware. The heavy reliance on US news reports of the time suggests a certain thinness of research. Even so, the picture of Schacht that emerges is reasonably well-balanced and so the book is worth a try."
1,Poor,Those parts of the book that deal with Schacht himself are OK. Those parts dealing with the bigger picture are poorly written and contain errors.
4,"Good bag, one caveat","I got two of these for help lugging stuff back across two continents, and while the one I've been travelling with so far has done pretty good, one thing slipped my mind when ordering these: there seems to be no way to lock them with those new TSA approved locks. I don't worry about locking luggage when I travel domestically in the USA< but for international travel, I always lock my bags, and I can't see a way to do that with these with any of the TSA locks. That said, the orange color makes it easy to find on the luggage carousel, the hardside protects the contents, and it locks and rolls easily. I am happy with the purchase, just wish I could figure out a way to lock these for the TSA..."
5,everything I expected,"We needed to travel with fragile contents and this hardshell suitcase provided all the security. After wrapping our dishes and liquids with bubblewrap, everything arrived without any breakage to our overseas desination. What a relief!"
5,90s Classics,"Feria is the most satisfying of the three accomplished works on this disc. It's not difficult to see why this is one of Lindberg's most popular pieces, and in 20 years' time I wouldn't be surprised if this was seen as one of the seminal works of the 1990s. The opening fanfare is thrilling, and pulls you into a riveting twenty minutes' listening. It's one of Lindberg's best-conceived pieces, structurally speaking, and the orchestration is really magnificent, full of interesting textures.Corrente II is a sort of rhythmic study, overlaying different ostinatos in a manner resembling Steve Reich, but rather more sophisticated; and Arena is a virtuosic orchestral toccata which certainly bears repeated hearing. This is a great disc for listeners new to Lindberg's music, as it gives an accurate picture of the composer at his most orchestrally inventive. Performance and recording are excellent."
4,Only decent product,"These work very well and are repairable. However don't leave them unmounted (hanging). The wear on the wires from the movement breaks them.Buy the bigger one, it lasts longer."
2,Talented but not enjoyable.,"I've seen this band live.Don't get me wrong, they are very talented, but with the odd combination of a disco beat, and guns and roses vocals, it isn't exactly enjoyable. Plus there is a lot of repitition, and i could hear what the lead singer was saying. If they tried for a different style they would be great. This album is an eye opener, but not in my tastes. Alot of the people at that concert just didn't get it, neither did I, but I'm sure they have a niche out there somewhere.Thats why I give a 2/5."
4,An elementary book for learning corrosion techniques,"A very simple book, written as a basic introduction to corrosion techniques. the book not only describes the various techniques but also suggest the techniques to be used for certain cases."
4,if you like,"If you like necro listen to ""brotha lynch hung"" - season of da siccness it compares to necro."
5,Underground Hip Hop by 1 of the greatest!,"A true must have for any fan! Necro, rips it up on this album as well as every other album he makes. Like a fine wine, Necro's albums get sicker and gorier with each track. Necro has been spittin' in this game for years now; it's time he gets the recognition he well deserves."
1,Bad Dog Book!!! Bad Bad Dog Book!!!,Hysterical - that this benign and boring waste of a tree would get on the New York Times Best Sellers list. Who in their right (or wrong) mind would find this funny reading and/or the photos attractive. Don't waste your money on this trite book. Better to send your money to the SPCA.
1,Party pooper...,I hate to be the only one who doesn't like this book. But I don't! I think it is a waste of time & money. I donated mine the day after I got it. Let the public library house it.
5,Very touching,"I first found this book in my counselor's office. She is a dog lover. After reading through it,it seemed like the perfect gift for a good friend of mine. That has proved to be a true statement. It has passages that are fun, passages that are sad. It is a nice little book."
5,Great pics...even better captions...,"Each page of this delightful book has a smile, if not an outright laugh...Pictures of various dogs, both mixed and pure-breeds in various typical ""doggie acts"" with the captions depicting the dog's ""thoughts"" on the matter... A small dog looks sadly toward the camera with "" I don't understand how you can be so smitten, you have me, yet you pet that kitten.""... The photos are excellent, both posed and ""action"" shots. No dog lover should be without this book"
5,A must for dog lovers,"The heart of a dog is captured in this book. The photographs, all excellent by themselves, are made perfect by the addition of the poems/captions which accompany each one. A range of dog emotions and thoughts are covered with expressions from the dogs serving as, at least what humans interpret to be, the true heart and soul of each dog. Sadness, euphoria, exasperation, and great humour are portrayed by a variety of breeds in a myriad of situations. You know what it means when your dog gives you ""that look."" Each ""look"" here will hit you the same way. I've shown the book to friends and each picture never fails to produce one of three reactions: (1) Awwwwww, (2) That's GREAT, (3) roaring laughter. I am ordering these as gifts for my dog-loving friends everywhere."
5,Can't bear to give it away,"I bought this book as a gift for my dog-lover brother, but once I read it I didn't want to give it up. Every single person who sees it on my desk flips through it, then borrows it, then doesn't want to give it back! We're all comparing the endearing characters in the book to our own pets. I open it whenever I need a good laugh. A beautifully produced book as well."
4,Great entertainment ...,"Wonderful collection of delightful photographs of our canine friends.Paper quality is sound, the printing clear and sharp ... the photographs well taken, well presented & well reproduced ... The photographer's sense of timing is superb ...Will make you smile ... and that alone makes the book worthwhile ...The only complaint we have is ... couldn't there have been more photographs ... *laughs* ... a sequel perhaps?"
5,I particularly loved the doggerel.,"The pictures by themselves are truly glorious. The accompanying poetic prose is sublime. To coin a canine equivalent to the cat's pajamas, this book is the dog's whiskers. Glory be to all involved."
5,Asa Cruz rocks.,"Asa Cruz, what words are there to describe this band? Talented, awesome. And Not to mention they are composed of four awesome guys. Their music is so worth buying. Especially if you really like U2 Depeche Mode and a bunch of others. These guys really know how to rock. They hold awesome concerts and they are really friendly too. Buy their cd and see what a fan means. or check out their page...[WEBSITE] or a fan page...[WESITE FOR FANS] rock on"
5,This quilt & blanket rack is wonderful,"I ordered this rack to display two quilts in my bedroom. It was easy to put together and is very study. It shows offs the quilts just the way I wanted it to, and it is a beautiful addition to our bedroom. The price was quite fair, and I waited less than a week for it to arrive."
2,They're still around?,"There was a point in my life around 1992 when I tried really hard to like Mudhoney. Now, that's a stupid thing to do, trying to like a band.Anyway, a few months ago I borrow this from a friend... turns out I still don't like Mudhoney. I find most of their stuff unlistenable. There's a couple good songs, ""You Got It"", etc. But the covers are my favorite part. I thought that was a cool thing to do. I also think its cool how Arm and Turner give tidbits about each song on the album. Maybe they're cool guys, but I still think their band sucks."
4,in and out of grace,"These four weren't as substantial as Nirvana, as slick as Pearl Jam, as portentous as Soundgarden or as tuneful as Screaming Trees. That and a serious case of inconsistency doomed them in the great grunge sweepstakes. Ironically, though, history has made their weakness their gift, as is borne out in this thorough two-disc collection of gems and rarities. Lacking undue ambition or outside pressures, Mudhoney stumbled into a kind of timelessness by burrowing through grunge into the American garage rock ethos the genre came from. While most of the Seattle slew already sounds moldy, Mudhoney's best songs from ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" to ""I Have to Laugh"" would have sounded as sharp 20 years earlier or a week from today. If their inability to evolve cost them a monument like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" it also saved them from junk like ""Dissident."" Considering how much fertile rock territory lies between, that's not a bad tradeoff."
1,Very disappointing,"I was so excited to get this toy for my three year old but I have been nothing but disappointed with it. The track pieces are very hard for me to put together, much less for my son to pull apart and put back together. We have had no fewer than 10 pieces break at the joint and have received no response from PlayToys when I sent them an email with pictures. I honestly don't know how fun this toy would be for my son since the pieces are always breaking so he never has a complete track. Terrible waste of money. Get all wooden tracks instead of this combo wood/plastic."
3,"Breaks easily, esp. for the price","This is a cute toy that my daughters enjoy playing with their cars and City Station. The problem I have with it is that the rubber connectors between the tracks fit too tightly on some of the pieces so that they have to be wiggled off very gently or they break off. It's frustrating for the kids when they can't get it apart, and then it's frustrating when the roads won't stay together. We got this last Christmas and a number of the connectors are broken in half. Why not make the whole piece wooden so it would be more durable? For $90 for a small set, I expected it to be heirloom quality. My kids are just as creative building roads out of their block sets and we don't have to worry about the blocks breaking. This set is fine and we'll keep it around, but if I had to do it again I would skip the roads and just buy more wooden blocks."
4,Great First Set,"We bought this set for our son as a gift last Christmas...it has held up beautifully and is a great first set for a two year old. We also got the bridge, which is great as well, except the sides of the bridge have grooves that do not allow the vehicles to drive straight over and go down the ramp without falling off the side (that's why four stars). Our little guy is now building this himself, and continues to love the Plan toys. We definitely recommend for parents looking for safe and quality toys."
4,this is a gift,This was a gift for Christmas but I know my grandson will enjoy this item. This is just what he wanted from Santa.
5,great wire,"worth the price for a needed wire, does what it says, arrived on time without any issue, just be careful not to put it next to power cables."
5,Phenomenal!,"This is fantastic! Catchy riffs, heavy drums and bass. There aren't a whole lot of hardcore songs out there better than Under the Water. Outstanding!!"
1,Just when you thought they couldn't get any worse....,"I don't know why Solid State, a extreme Christian music label, signed these guys in the first place. Their first CD was just plain bad, but this one is annoying! The vocals are pathetic, and basically kill any good that might lie hidden under them. This guy doesn't know how to scream. The music is pretty weak, without any really impressive guitar riffs or solos, and not any good drumming. Scandinavia is known for producing some awesome metal bands (EXTOL, Antestor, Horde, etc.) but this band isn't one of them."
4,At The Barricades We Fall,"The new Selfmindead CD is very good. I was very impressed with their new work.The music is similar but the production is a little different and in my opinion it sounds better for the most part. The vocals are a lot better on this CD. Very hardcore. His vocals are more agressive. The music is similar to the first CD. The songs are straight ahead hardcore with a touch of rock'n'roll. The best tracks are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10. The guitar part for 7 is very metal riff-like; it's very cool. A hardcore CD well worth the time. Fans of Snapcase, Blindside, and Stretch Arm Strong should all find something that they like in this release."
3,very cool stuff,"i'v been hearing this band off of compolations and magazines for a while now and had to get this cd. I wasn't dissapointed. Fans of blindside and wan't something a tad bit more aggresive should look no further than this disc.Cool drum beats and of kilter sence of rhythm make them on of the best bands on solid state. Songs like ""one step foward"" and ""rules to break/laws to change"" show the bands odd rhythms.Songs like ""under the water"" are just flat out arresive rockers. Warning not everyone will like this album its not your basic rap/rock or normal hardcore that most people associate with heavy rock these days, personally I think its a great album for a change up."
4,Superb but in small quantity back/white F-1 photographs.,"A great piece for F-1 book collector.Almost all of the N.Snowdon and D.Burnett photos are superb, especially from the 60's and 70's. The text for each photo is very accurate. Some photos are very rare and even sensational. This is a book that really could be the double or even the triple of the 160 pages with +/- 250 photos. The some confuse layout of contents and the lack of some years of the 4 decades are the weak points of this fascinating book."
3,"Yes, but . . .",An excellent history of one aspect of Budapest's history. A good city map with the book would have been helpful to those who either have not lived there or who (like me) left the city over 50 years ago.
5,Excellent Introduction for Beginners,I recently tried a Jun Fan Gung Fu class in my city and thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be enrolled as a student starting next month. This book provides the terminology and techniques you will start learning in any Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do academy. I really like the way each technique starts with a clear explanation of the 'how and why' and then shows many pictures showing all the variations. I wish the authors would continue with more books. Even though this one is old it is still 100% applicable to todays training methods.If you are real serious about understanding the science of Bruce Lee's techniques then read this book first then read Tao of Jeet Kune Do second. It will make a lot more sense to you.
1,US Buyers Beware!!!,"If you live in the US and are considering purchasing a copy as listed; DON'T!!! The item is actually PAL and not region coded for US viewing. The reviews so far have been misleading as to who can view it. And the listing has it as being US/Canada release, which was brought to Amazon's attention for correction 3 weeks ago. The average US household does not have a multi-region DVD player nor will most US computers/laptops play the disc. Just hoping to save other US Kylie fans any disappointment!!"
4,Poor pack,"It is a great DVD and despite being done in south america is fine. Only thing that upset me was packing quite poor and ugly, not the jewel case that came when the English version is."
3,Defective,"Well I love documentary and concert, I have watched them online. But I recieved the product and The doc disc doesnt play at all and the concert stops playing halfway through. Wish I would have returned because I still do want it I just want one that works, but I didn't open and try it until last week and I am pass the 30 day return policy."
5,In the silver shadows I will radiate and glow for you...,"A very beautiful documentary put together by William Baker, I didn't find anything strange with this film like some of the other reviews i read. There were a lot of rumors about this film and I'm happy to say thats all they were. I enjoyed the documentary it made me appreciate my Queen even more. Kylie Minogue is a beautiful, intelligent, talented and strong woman. I found that the Homecoming concert was even better than the Showgirl concert! I love this 2 disc set!"
4,the best so far,"Obviously the Homecoming live from Melbourne is much much more better than the Showgirl live from London, with the new song list, new costume, new stage design and of course the brand new KYLIE.My favorite from this live dvd, is definitely SLOW.The white diamond film is nothing special except her personal daily routine during her preparing and rehearsal for her homecoming performance. If you are a true fan of her, you will be able to like it. If you ever watch ""True or Dare"" or ""I'm gonna tell you a secret"" by Madonna, you more or less can tell what kind of film it is."
4,SPACE-IAL :),"Dedicated to preserving the old ways, Tynan Thorn had led the austere life of a recluse. He had never laid eyes on a woman until the ravishing Amara swept into his spartan bedroom to change his life forever.Daring and uninhibited, Amara set out to broaden Tynan's viewpoint, but she never expected that the area he would be most interested in exploring was her own exquisitely sensitive body. Nor did she guess that his lack of experience would be more than compensated by natural talent.Master of self denial and mistress of sensual delight, Tynan and Amara were a study in contrasts. But as their bodies united in explosive ecstasy they discovered a whole new world, where together they could soar among the stars.Original and steamy romance! if you can grab a copy i suggest you read it!!"
5,Just One More Week in the Never Ending War Against Child Abu,"I am a Social Work Supervisor. Ms. Cartee's book vividly depicts the types of cases that social work investigators encounter on a daily basis. Her book is well written and also reflects some of the personalities of workers in the child protective services agencies. The book gives the reader the opportunity to be an investigator for a week and live the requirements and challenges of being a child abuse and neglect investigator. I particularly recommend the reading of this book for county social workers who, I know, will relate to the situations described and to all students who aspire to become social workers and problem solvers for abused and neglected children."
4,A Timely Book,"Sins of the FathersThere is a level of awakening that is imparted into one's heart as each page is read. This book has elements of history, elements of pain, elements of a burden for Britain as a nation, for Europe and for countries of the world where there has been marginalisation.My heart cried as I learnt of the ""Sins of the Fathers"" because this book does expose the truth about the sins. It also speaks of the good that the Fathers of this nation (Britain) did. There are several relevant examples that act as eye openers. The book is British in its focus but truly global in its context.No one should read this book, if they are unwilling to pray. The real response to this book should be in prayer. Prayer, repentance, God's forgiveness and Grace are the main themes in this book."
5,OMG I didn't know that!,"For all of us who barely got out of world history in school, this book is a must! Faith based, but so wonderfully written. It's a keeper!, but a lender too!"
2,Not impressive at all,"I bought this because i really love the features that it offers. The caller id works just fine, so does the radio and the alarm.But during phone conversation i would hear a really annoying and piercing beep coming from the phone, as if someone is pressing the knobs whilst i was on it. also, the ring tone is lame, and the snooze button does not snooze to the time u set it...if u set to snooze for 10 mins, it snoozes for 15 mns.Man, the radio is the best thing on it."
2,Cheapo,"Neat concept, however the phone is very cheaply made. Additionally, the clock is not lit therefore it is impossible to tell the time in the dark unless you turn on a light."
3,Shredder,"This shredder was great when we first purchased it for our IT office. However, within 7 months of use, it started automatically running without stopping and almost overheated during the weekend. Fellowes provides a warranty but the warranty consists of a list of your local repair people to call and then waiting 7-10 days for the actual repair to take place. All in all I wouldn't spend the money on this machine or the company again."
3,Item pictured is not the item received,"I thought I was purchasing a bottle of liquid Sting-Eze, but the item I received was a sponge-tipped tube. If I had wanted the tube I would have ordered it. What I want is the dropper bottle. The contents are not exactly the same -- the amount of benzocaine in the tube is half the amount in the bottle. The seller needs to correct the item image and description."
1,Wrong picture/misleading,"I received a different looking item than pictured. The picture is of a bottle of""Sting Eze"" which is what I wanted. But I received a Sting Relief pen. Very misleading!"
4,Saying No,"I purchased this book as a gift and it was gladly received, not sure if it helped in saying no but it was a good gift."
2,book to say NO is TINY!,This book is one I can hold in my palm. I was shocked..but have learned to Love it in my purse!!!
3,Magic Mushroom Band - 'Re-Hash' (Voiceprint),"A collection of songs from the Magic Mushoom Band's early days - all re-recorded. Liked ""Magic Eye"", ""Turban Paranoia"" as well as this CD's two covers - Tomorrow's ""My White Bicycle"" and Hendrix's ""Are You Experience?"". Stange thing here is that when you listen to these two covers, they almost appear to be a completely different song altogether. My only complaint here is there should of maybe have been a couple more songs to this title. Not a bad pick."
5,Christian Saturday Night Live,"If Saturday Night Live was organized by a bunch of Christians, this is what is would be like. Kilpatrick brings raw satire to a Christian format that makes for some great laughs and insights into Evangelical behaivor. If you're a Christian with a good sense of humer, this book is for you."
5,a perfect satire,"Having grown up in the church and attended a Christian college, it's scary how right on Kilpatrick is in his field guide. I laughed out loud several times in recognition, and shook my head in embarassment as I noted truths about myself and friends of mine. This is a must-read if you are an evangelical with a sense of humor."
4,Funny and insightful,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a few who are malcontent with the evangelical life. I thought it was definitely a good laugh, but if you are evangelical, be prepared to laugh at yourself and not get offended! Though mostly accurate, there were some definite dated things...such as I doubt many evangelical teen girls have Michael W. Smith posters on their walls anymore...a whole new slew of Christian music talent has overthrown the exclusivity of one act. Otherwise, it's a quick easy read."
4,Unique and Refreshing,"The book came quickly and in great condition...The book is a bit crass and irreverent in ways but that's part of what makes it so funny and refreshing. It makes fun of those things we cling to instead of clinging only to Christ. The working out of faith looks as varied as there are people in the world, with the cross alone being the central point. The book shows how we often make it about so many other things."
5,A hilarious but insightful book.,"Read this book! I didn't know what to think of it at first, but once I realized the writer was a dedicated Christian himself I relaxed and just let the laughs flow. He gives a humerous and spot-on portrayal of the good and bad of modern American Christianity. This one's a keeper and besides giving it to my pastor (who enjoys a laugh or two) I plan on slipping a copy into the pews of some church members who tend to think a little too highly of themselves."
1,Only buy if you can get it for under $5 and even then...,"I'll be brief,1. The book is 14.99 but is thin and short. Not worth that much money.2. Instead of poking fun at real life Christian stories the author made up most of them. If I knew this book was just a big advertisement for the author's website I would have passed it up completely. All of the weird stories that the author has throughout the book are made up!3. His tone is more harsh/critical pretending to make a joke. You get the feeling that the author is bitter.4.

4,Hilarious Book,"This book is painfully true but very, very funny. If you have a good sense of humor, you'll enjoy reading this book."
2,Ugly,"This shoe is much uglier in person than it is in the picture. As a matter of fact, if I had known how ugly it was I would never have bought it. I know it's not supposed to be a fashion shoe, but still, it's embarrassing.It's fairly comfortable, but it doesn't have as much support as I would like. The sole of the shoe is thin. I can't IMAGINE actually hiking in these!If I had to do it over I wouldn't buy it again."
2,"Readable, but somewhat off course","Aczel describes the compass as the second most important technological innovation in history, after the wheel. He then proceeds to wander through a series of brief histories without chronological order, giving disproportionate attention to a man who may or may not have lived in Amalfi, Italy. Aczel is at his best in capsule histories of maritime activity, but is frustratingly unsystematic in his chronologies and his descriptions of how the compass is used. He mentions the Global Positioning System, but does not tell us how it works. The figure titled ""how the magnetic compass works"" is misleading, as it shows the axis of the Earth's magnetic field coinciding with the Earth's axis of rotation. One gets the impression of a hastily written book."
1,Waste of Money,"What a waste of a good idea. The author has nothing to say and thankfully says it in as few words as possible. Sample chapter gives the history of Marco Polo, with the author admitting that Polo says nothing about the compass in his writings!Don't waste your time."
1,The unanswered Riddle,The book lacks real research and does not answer the riddle of the compass. We are left with what we learned in grade school - that the Chinese probably invented the compass and that it helps a lot when sailing about the world.The author fails to make his case that the compass is the second greatest invention (after the wheel). And he glosses over the invention of a chronometer which really made navigation a science.The time spent reading this small book would be better spent doing something else.
3,I'm a bit disappointed,"It started out strong then the author began to continuously repeat himself and the book became reminiscent of a section out a high school text book. He was very vague about most if not all his accounts of significant accomplishments through the use of the compass. When it comes down to it the book seemed a bit rushed and lacked the detail most readers would like from a book tackling such a ""riddle"". Overall it's a short enough read providing a few interesting points and tid-bits that may warrant your precious time."
2,non PC review,"Let's get this out of the way - the book is not written or edited to American form. The style does not flow in the same manner as other historical books. It was not a fun read for me. The organization of material is not straightforward - chronologically or technologically. I was also disappointed by the lack of technical detail regarding the compass and other navigation aids. Historical detail is also lacking which I should have guessed from the size of the book. Not to ruin it for others, but there isn't much intrigue regarding his story either. I did learn more about Italian city states and would check out the credited creator's statue if ever in town."
2,High school essay - wery well written,"The riddles addressed, like who was the first to invent the compass and whether the Amalfi hero really existed, are very quickly addressed. Most of the book seemed to me like an effort to fill in the required number of pages to justify a book instead of an article. The language and style are fine though, otherwise I would give it lower mark."
5,Barry's,"I love all of Barry Farm's beans. They ship fast and are kind to the earth. I only wish the beans came in resealable, reusable bags."
1,Not worth it!,"This PDF download, HANDLING THE RESTAURANT INTERVIEW, is not worth the time it will take you to download it. The very short, widely-spaced article offers no new advice or substance to anyone seeking materials regarding business dining etiquette. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. The article is a short, unworthy bunch of fluff."
2,Product not as pictured,"The image provided for this product here (and on Beck Arnley's catalog [...] show it including all the seals and boots required for two calipers. As shipped, this product includes only the parts necessary to rebuilt the pistons on a pair of calipers. There are no o-rings or slide-rod boots.Thankfully, as of December 2009, the image on this product has been updated and now correctly reflects the product I received."
3,A hard dry read but good content!,"This book has been of a great influence in at least one company in moving towards process management. I have tried to read it, and even though the ideas and content is excellent, and gives a very good perspective on process management, it is unfortunately a very dry read, and may be best read in sections or specific parts for emphasis. I am giving it 3 stars for content and usefulness towards ideas in process management."
1,Why doesn't Amazon let you rank this book Zero (0),"That is what this book deserves, a big fat zero. This stuff was treated in much greater depth by business thought leaders several years ago. Notions of inter-enterprise process engineering, powered by the Internet, were rigorously documented several years ago. This professor turned management prophet must have spent his millions derived from his previous book of ""stories"" --circa 1993-- and needed a new source of funds as the world went far past him and his business process rengineering (BPR) stories, long ago. This guy writes stories, not first principles upon which companies can act. Ever tried to ""implement"" a story? Save your money --buy Tapscott, Fingar, Weil or Hagel books on the subject."
3,"Methods are many, principles are few.","As a consultant, I often remind my clients that ""Methods are method, principles are few. Methods frequently change, principles rarely do."" Mr. Hammer's 9-point agenda is composed of basic principles (talk to the customer, make it easy for customers to buy, focus on processes, etc.). His 9-points have have been taught and recommended by many for years and years. What's new? Mr. Hammer now calls them The Agenda.There is little to argue about in this book other than it's too long on principles, about right on examples and too short on ""how to implement them""."
2,High Level Stuff - not that deep,A high level review of the combination of recent management theories and then not that convincingly done. Best chapter was on process management. Rest on customers etc. I can read elsewhere from other authors who know more about the subject.2 Stars.
1,No lighted dial.,I ordered this alarm clock/radio/phone for my bedside table. I returned it because it did not have a lighted dial. I did not want to have to turn on the bedside light during the night in order to be able to see the time.
1,Unreliable clock alarm.,"The unit only deserves one star if you're purchasing it for the alarm clock, because there is no battery backup. If you have a power outage, you'll have to reset the clock and alarm. Needless to say, you can't count on the alarm to wake you if you have a power outage in the middle of the night. Bad design, imo."
2,disappointed,"product had to short of cord for using phone, time of day was not lighted and the quality of sound from the radio was poor."
2,Can't see clock in the dark,Well mine has a battery backup. Am not sure why the other persons didn't. But I didn't like this clock because it has not back lighting you can't see the clock in the dark at all. It seems silly to have an alarm clock that has no light.
1,Make that ZERO stars,"This is a piece of junk that doesn't work. The display is NOT lit in any way. The alarm ""feature"" is hard to set and the caller ID is worthless if you can't read it. I returned this immediately for a refund! Don't waste the time or the shipping to check it out."
1,Bad choice,I was very dissapointed with the Colby CT-P650 phone alarm clock. The digital face does not light up so you cannot see what time it is in the middle of the night. Once you set the alarm it will automaticaly reset itself for the same time the following day which causes problems if you do not want the alarm set for the next day. After a week of frustration I stopped useing it. It is now in the dresser drawer. Anybody want it?
2,Coby CT-P650 Phone with Caller ID,The LCD does NOT light up how can you see the alarm clock at night or in the early morning. I did not like the product becasue of that reason.
5,Great vacuum... great bags,I really like this vacuum I inherited from my mother. I had been unable to use it do to lack of bags. No local stores sold these and I was so happy to find them here.
4,good for domestic use,"I got this a few months back and have used for for a variety of roasts including a turkey, various cuts for pot roast, a 7lb brisket, and boston butt. So it's large enough for what you are likely to be cooking. It has held up well and is easy enough to clean. I was a little worried because it is a little thin where the handles connect to the roaster, but outside of a little flex I haven't a had a problem with it. Considering how much roasters go for, I think this is a good investment for everyday use."
2,Not too Pleased Made in China,"I thought that all Chicago metallic products were made in the USA. This pan was Made in China. Perhaps the pan will still perform well, but I would have not purchased had I known this in advance. Just my humble opinion."
2,"Lena is great, the re-mastering is poor!","As the CD cover said explicity, this is a disc that comprises of songs that were sung by Lena Horne that were original distributed as V Disc for the US armed forces overseas during WWII. The performance of Lena is as great as usual, however, the remastering is poor because you can hear the swirling sound of the turntable and the needle scratching the surface of the disc constantly. Sometimes, the clicking and popping sounds are so loud and bad, they actually mask the background music and Lena's voice, thus interfering the enjoyment of the performance. Shame on the record label for skipping the usage of sophisticated remastering and archiving method of older recorded mediums!!"
4,It worked for me,"I was a bit skeptical of this product, but since my Sony DVD player kept getting the dreaded ""C 13"" errors, I figured trying this lens cleaner was cheaper than buying a new DVD player.It was extremely easy to use, and it worked! My DVD player is now much more reliable, and is playing several DVDs that it refused to play before the cleaning.As an unexpected bonus, the DVD that comes with this kit includes tracks that help you tune your home theater system's sound. I didn't really need this, but I appreciate that they went to the extra effort of including it."
5,Excellent! Won't be disappointed!,"It is great to listen and enjoy the music of Oil City Symphony. If you want to remember this musical, it is definitely recommended. Well, after watching the real show, of course."
1,I guess the subject was just too ugly to make it any better,I was not prepared for the disgusting content of this book. Nothing that I read in the initial read said anything about the sexual depravity of these people. I was not able to finish the book.
1,its not all true,"my name is judy millican and im the sister of lisa ann millican , i myself have read this book and i can tell u every thing in this book is not true!!!!the part about the family life of lisa that is!!!!the other i dont know but thats judiths part"
3,Software not included,"I agree with the editorial statement, ""Best of all, the companion CD includes ... and a trial version of the software"". However, my recently arrived copy does not include a trial of PSE 3.0.I look forward to working my way through the book but first I have to buy the software! I was 90% sure that I would end up purchasing PSE 3.0 anyway so this is a somewhat minor annoyance.For those of you who wanted to try PSE 3.0 before shelling out $100, look elsewhere."
5,Excel Mechanics,"This is an excelent book, dynamic and punctual.This is my favorite.I recommend its lecture."
1,Copycat?,"I have not yet played this game but, from the reviews I see here I can only draw the conclussion that it has been copied from Red Storm Rising from about Six years ago, Seawolf class subs with advanced torpedoes and many other items listed as new and great were on the game developed from the Tom Clancy book of the same title. I shall invest in the game and hope it is at least an improvement on a sub sim which I have not yet found a match for. I am less than impressed with 688 attack sub, Red Storm was much better laid out and easier to control with fewer keys to master and so I hope this is not just an improvement of 688 as that game needs much more than a few new gimmicks."
4,good old sub command,"I remember back when this game first came out it was the best thing ever and now after 16 years its still great fun! great shipping time very fast and easy, the game came undamaged and works great (came with box and booklet) awsome service thanks, Jon"
4,Untitled,"Fun but complicated. Be prepared to devote a lot of free-time to figure this out. After that, it kicks some. Be sure to watch your keel also."
4,Sequel to Janes 688 attack sub,"If you played and liked Janes 688 you should get this.If not, submarine games play out very very slowly. A lot of tactics and unclear information. If that is your cup of tea then buy it."
3,Adam's Review,This game piqued my interest/liking in the navy. I like how you can create your own missions. (You do this by pressing mission editor)The game is 33%
5,Excellent product,Great product. This was exactly what I was looking for. Fast shipping and great price. I had bought one of these at a local store and needed more but were not carried anymore. It feels soft against your skin unlike some of the other wallets I found. Good quality also
5,My favorite short animation,"They should put on DVD but its not I don't think, I liked this when I was younger and always watched when I got home from H.S. until they canned it."
5,Beautiful shoe,"This is a great sandal. It's sleek, a lovely color and as comfortable all Birks sandals."
2,Good as an introduction to English styled raqs sharqi,"There isnt any real explanations about the moves but if you are use to just following along it would work out ok. I personally would rate her as an intermediate dancer who has a teaching video out. Her costuming in the cane section is lovely and I did enjoy her use of cane, it is her one strong point. This tape is pricey but it is the only example of this style of Raqs Sharqi teaching in the USA. The style was developed in the UK by a dancer named Suraya Hilal but Hilary is teaching it so poorly I hesitate to mention any connection between the two."
5,one of the best collections of songs I have heard in a while,"Original, so many influences in there- I wish there were more recordings of nuru kane's music- this transports you to a different place and time while still being clearly modern music. There are some times where it seems to fall into what I will call world music cliches- but frequently it transcends that- tracks 3, 7 and 12 are some of my favorites on this one, followed by track 1- and all for completely different reasons.Highly recommended to any one who likes the blues or jazz or flamenco or reggae or ... check it out! Would love to see this music live!"
2,Slow speed makes the capacity less impressive,"Lexar memory cards all seem to be slower than other brands (i.e. SanDisk..). Rememeber that Lexar has 3 types of SD cards: Professional (60X), Plantinum (40X), and regular which is this one. So this one is the slowest among them. Slow speed not only make you wait for a long time for transfering files, it also might affect what you store. If you are using continuous mode in digital camera it might lengthen the gap time between each picture, or (depends on the model of the camera) produce gibberish images. I haven't confirm this myself but people complained that when recording audio at high quality mode, there will be skips during the track.The bottom line is, Lexar DOES make durable cards, but the speed for writing is a drawback. Unless you use this for your camera without the continuous mode, I don't recommend this card. I will rather spend money on SanDisk Ultra II which is a little pricy but worth it."
3,Pea coats,"Genuine U.S.Navy coats are available on the net,you just have to look hard. These coats are made of recycled 75% wool instead of 100% like they should be. They have 10 buttons when they should have 8. All in all a used Navy issue coat is superior to the new knock off."
5,"Rugged, Dependable, Speedy, and Spacious","What more can I say? I've been using SD cards for several years. ALL my computer docs and data go directly on the card. It is a great way to keep a lean, fast-running computer without the hassle of CD's. Once a week I back-up and sync my existing SD card with a second card. I simply plug two card readers into my computer. With a few clicks I'm done. Also, it's a good idea to defrag your memory cards once in a while just like your main hard drive."
1,DEAD CARD,"We purchased this card just a month ago... Wanting a fresh card for the birth of our third child. For just ten dollars, we thought it was quite the find!!! Yesterday, after over two hundred pictures taken the card died. At first I thought it was my camera, but other cards worked in it. In a panic I took the card to the local grocers, where they have a digital photo kiosk... Said the device didn't detect anything. And when attempting to upload the images to my computer... Same thing! Heart broken I attempted to find a solution online... And though I haven't tried it yet -- some people have had some luck (with this card) by taking it to a profecional. From what we have learned, after taking the card in most ppl were able to salvage 20-80% of their images. Defently worth a try. BAD BAD CARD"
2,No Housebreaking Information,"Even though the front and back cover both show ""housebreaking"" as part of what is included in the book, it is not mentioned even once in the book. The book mostly provides a historical perspective and physical description of the breed. There is very little practical information on how to properly take care of a dachshund or how to train one."
2,Totally Ordinary,"I'd heard the buzz about Pagan Kennedy, so I figured I'd grab this and see what the fuss was all about. Set in 1968, the book is about two 30-something sisters who embark on a cross-country road trip following the death of their father, who've they've been caring for. It's more or less a belated coming of age tale for Frannie, the virgin of the two, as she gradually sheds her safe life and appearance. Although there are a couple of nice lines (""My mother understood longing better than love."") it didn't strike me as anything special and didn't enthuse me to pursue anything else by Kennedy."
5,Read slowly,"I liked this book more than I can say. I found the prose so overwhelmingly, sometime excruciatingly, lovely that I forced myself to read slower, to make it last, not end so soon. Then I read it again."
3,You can't please everybody!,"After reading the 15 reviews of this book (either 5-star or 1 star), I had to buy it to see what the fuss was all about. For me it was a refreshing philosophical change from my two years of tight tedious instruction at an expensive watercolor class. Sure, the short exercises about people, animals and cottages are really ugly, but the emphasis on minimal equipment (all British), limited palettes, and wet-on-wet looseness really resonated with me. The excellent step-by-step numbered photographs accompanying the numbered written remarks (including pigments) are carefully planned, especially for the later landscapes. Looked at closely, one can see how the pigments spread and blend with time. I've concluded that the people who hate this book are experienced painters who either already know all this or don't like loose wet watercoloring (or both). This is probably a book for lonely beginners or worried intermediates like me."
5,Quick & Clever: Watercolour Landscapes,"Obviously those who didn't like this book: 1)Don't know how to ""step outside the box"" and 2)Haven't seen the artist at work. For those who are intimidated by the thought of painting but have always wanted to, this book is excellent. It makes watercolor easy and enjoyable. Once going through the exercises you too can create beautiful paintings that you will want to show off!"
5,very helpful book one of the best,the type of book i have been waiting for for ages. so helpful - i feel i can paint at last - one of the best on the market. fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,fantastic book - will get every one painting,great book - full of lovely painting to copy yourself in your own home -------- and you can do it. great instuction. you cannot fail with this fantastic art book.
2,Avril isn't in this dvd,"This is a crappy dvd. If youre looking for live performances of avril and interviews with her, dont buy this dvd. But if you are looking for a brief history of how avril became famous you should buy this dvd."
3,P1610 screen protector,"Works well, easy to write on. Not specified for P1610, but for 8.9"" screens. $20 vs $60 for Fujitsu version.NOT a perfect fit. Width is off by an annoying 1/8 inch."
3,This is the semi-official account,"The author's name is E. Bartlett Kerr, and LeMay was a General in the Army Air Force, not the Air Force to correct the entry. This book is written from the perspective of the U.S. Army Air Force and corrects the impression some writers give that LeMay was somehow personally responsible for the incendiary attacks. This books shows the entire scope of the operation, including the politics behind the weapons. It describes the fires, the Japanese politics, the strength of Hirohito in demanding peace, etc. It maintains that the war could have been won without resorting the A-bomb, but misses the theory that the bombs were dropped to keep Russia from dividing up Japan they way the divided up Germany. Readers should also consult: Guillain, Robert (1981). I Saw Tokyo Burning. Garden City, NY: Doubleday. He was a Frenchman living in Japan. His account is a clear picture from a resident's perspective."
2,Polaroid warrenty no good,"My Polaroid 40"" LCD TV that we bought at Wal-Mart has what looks like a gasket slipping down behind the screen, which you can see. It's around the edge and in two different places, one is about an inch long at the left top and the other is on the right and seems to be slipping out of the frame. Can not get a response at Polaroid after calling 5 times and waiting over 45 min. we got 2 email address's and they were returned by my ISP as not correct try again. This TV is still under warranty.Polaroid 40"" Flat Panel LCD HDTV Model 4011-TLXB"
5,Impressed,"This was my very first safety razor. Having used Mach 3 and other trio-bladed razors, I decided to give my ""dad's"" razor a spin. I did some research on the subject, and Merkur razors in general before making a purchase. based on the reviews and others shaving experiences, I took the plunge. I'm glad I did. I used a quality badger brush, shave cream from Taylor of Bond street, Derby razor blades, and clubman bay rum aftershave. The weight of the razor is such that I really did not have to use much pressure. The razor slides down my cheeks effortlessly and you can see the results of a very close shave. Best I've had in years.You can't go wrong with this one. I did have one issue at first and that was the short handle. I got used to it after about a weeks use. It's like second nature to me now. There is a long handled model out there, but I think the short length balances well with the weight of the razor. Enjoy!"
4,Good for the price,"Not a bad DE razor considering the price. Better quality than other cheaper ones but not the ""top notch"" quality people say Merkurs have. It's solidly build and will last a long time but the finish isn't the best.Another issue is the handle, it's fairly short so it might take a few shaves to get used to it.I liked it though, it's not overly aggressive, it's forgiving, fairly well balanced, and original looking considering today's standards.The design is great if you want something with some ""character"" but don't want to buy a used antique razor.Again, not a bad razor for the price but I wouldn't pay much more for it. There are other brands out there that offer outstanding quality at a similar price and, unless I have no choice, I'll stick with those."
5,Healing Ancient Wounds: The Renegade's Wisdom,This book was first loaned to me. I enjoyed it so much I purchased my own copy. It does a great job of explaining myofacial release and myofacial unwinding in layman's terms. I am recovering from a near fatal car crash and a physical therapist is using these techniques to help me recover physically and release the cellular trauma of the crash through unwinding. John Barnes is a dynamic person and the book held my interest through many anecdotal stories.
4,Great Ball Head and difficult to maneuver,"I find it difficult to maneuver. I have small hands and I am not very strong, so I struggle trying to place and remove the camera. Other than that, this is a stable and great ball head worth the price."
4,watch for this band!,"from the first time i saw this band live, i was hooked on their energy and sheer brutality of their music. since then, they have released their sophomore album, novella of uriel. this is a very brutal album, leaning a bit more on the metal side of the hardcore scene. every song on this album is a great example of what heavey hardcore should be like. some stand outs on this Cd are 'wetwork' 'and a serephim cries' 'en sabah nur'. this band is gaining much poprularity, expect them to be one of the next big hardcore bands. check them out if they come to a town near you, you wont be dissapointed."
2,Fading Fast,"Listen to ""Fire"" or ""Honey"" and then listen to this. It will show you how in the span of just 3 years how far the once great Players had fallen. The lead off single ""Funk-o-Nots"" is a decent Parliament sound-a-like but after that the Players try to recapture thier past weakly- ""Sleepwalkin'"" is a ""It's All Over"" sound-a-like with none of the passion, and the title cut seems to be reminicent of ""Angel"" but stiff and dull. Elsewhere they try to mine Earth, Wind, & Fire (""Time Slips Away"") but again they just tread water. Giving this 2 stars is being generous."
4,Nice piece,"Quality made cigarette lighter, the fact that it's billet aluminum is very nice. Only negative is that it shipped with the face having light scratches all over, doesn't detract from the quality though. Nice replacement for factory lighter, helps lighten up my dull black interior."
1,bad cigarette lighter,It broke as soon as I pulled it from socket.don't waste your money.wished I could gave it a better review.
1,Cigarette Lighter does not work on all vehicles,"I purchased the lighter for my 2005 Honda Civic and received it pretty quickly. About 5 days after I ordered it, so the shipping was very nice. When I tried using it in the car, it did not work. It plugs into the 12v socket but it will not hold and warm up like it is supposed to. It just pushes in and pops out right away, like a button. I wanted a lighter not a button, if I wanted a button, I could've gone to Auto Zone and bought a button. I tried the lighter in my parents Dodge Caravan, to see if it works and it did. Didn't want to waste my time with returning the lighter so I guess my parents got a nice new lighter for their van....."
1,Cigarette Lighter Razo RG30,"Doesn't work properly in any of our three vehicles, Ford, Mercury and Acura! In the Ford, it pops out on to the floor when it is heated. In the Mercury, it doesn't pop out at all when heated. In the Acura it doesn't heat."
2,"LOW-FAT, LOW- SODIUM, LOW-SUGAR","This book still have the magic and mysticism of a distant planet, but is rather insipid and simplistic. Very low-reading."
1,Too unbelievable and simplistic,This book and it's storyline could have been written by my 13-yr-old (without the sex). I couldn't even stand to read beyond pg 5.
4,Sweet,"I have never read anything else by this author, but this little teaser will have me seeking her work out. I would like to see moreof her characters of this strange world. Not al all what I expected, it is light and sweet. The happily ever after is there, but a taster is what will come in her full length books I hope!"
4,Jayne Castle/Krentz's Harmony series before #1,"I got this one because I'd already gotten ""After Dark"" (the official 1st book of the series) and didn't want the duplicate couplet of both in ""Harmony"". But recommend that you get ""Harmony"" only because this one is a novelette & only 82 pages long. But if you're in the same situation as I was - it's a great, though almost too short, start to her Harmony series. It stands up pretty well without a lot of description of the setting, she does great work in evolving her characters in a SciFi/Fantasy future world. Other than being very short, since I'm now very familiar with her Harmony world scene, was mostly disappointed that it didn't have any ""Dust Bunnies""! This series has become one of my top favorites - enjoy getting hooked on these stories - which this short novelette gives you a great intro as an appetizer to taste the rest!"
2,It's Ok for underarms,It's too small so I need like 2 hours to depilate my legs and I'm short so my legs aren't large. I haven't got good results for my bikini area. I recomended it only for underarms and legs and bikini retouch.
5,"Great product, works well",I have had the Conair ER2CS for a month and I use it almost everyday and it removes the hair well. I am very happy with it.
2,Had to come back to say...,"I had already written a review for this item a while ago. I no longer use it. First time I reviewed it I had been using it for about 3 months or so... And really, the epilator works very good for what is made. At first, the first 3 to 4 months I had no ingrown hairs, or some but still manageable, and the skin stayed smooth for at least 3 weeks. But later, as I used it for 6 to 8 months things turn out to be different: hair starts growing unevenly, I mean, some hair grows first, some later, so you really never have smooth skin, because some hair gets weak faster than the rest... And also, as it becomes weaker it starts to grow to the inside, therefore you end up with a lot of ingrown hairs and no smooth skin at all. I had to use a tweezer every time, very time-consuming!! Anyway... I don't use it anymore now.... I went back to the razor and I'm saving for the laser.... I think that's the best option right now."
1,Better off with the Motorola 5200,"One of these units was doa, and the menu system was incomprehensible. We ended up getting the Motorola 5200 and although the earpiece that came with the units is a waste we are very pleased with the price/performance/ease of the 5200s. Don't waste time with the audiovox. ..."
2,Don't buy it!,"This video is not worth the money. Maybe for 1/3 the price it would be. Yes, she does teach you some moves, which she does spend a good amount of time on, but they are VERY basic. However, it is very difficult to understand her! The sound is atrocious, you can barely hear her, and if you can hear her, you sometimes have to struggle to understand because of her british accent. On top of this who would choose a black costume, with a (very) dark gray background? It makes it more difficult to see her moves very well."
5,Comprehensive Guide For Beginners,"For someone like myself who is a complete beginner when it comes to belly dancing, I found Hilary's video both instructive and informative. Having her introduce the different movements one by one enabled me to get a feel for the whole dance form, and gradually, through practice, to be able to put the movements together and begin to improvise.Although the sound quality was slightly muffled, this was no problem when the volume was turned up. I had no trouble in picking up what she was trying to convey.She goes to a lot of trouble to introduce quite a number of basic moves that could be likened to the ABC of belly dancing. Once these are mastered, it is then easier to join them together into whole sequences of movement. Teaching in this way seems to be a very sensible approach to the whole subject. I would recommend this video to anyone who is also a complete beginner and wishes to start from scratch."
2,Not professionally produced.,"I am not going to say much about Mrs Thacker tuition in this video. Unfortunately, the poor quality of this video makes it very hard to appreciate it at all. It is not a matter of accents, but a matter of the sound being absolute awful. I've worked in a tv station for several years and a tape like this one would never be broadcast. You can tell there was absolutely no audio posproduction, so any important information just gets lost, which is right against the idea of a tuition video. The video is also not very well lit and it's hard to follow the moves. As I said, I am not complaining about Mrs Thacker exercises or accent, just about the huge flaws that make this tape a bad buy. I hope she can find someone to produce a better video for her in the future."
1,Forget it! Save your Money...,"I found this tape to be of very poor quality. It was dark, the quality of this Belly Dancing Tape is bad and has nothing to do with American or other accent. At least if it were the accent you could turn down the volume. As it is, you'd have to turn the TV off! The instruction is lacking. Its a lousy vhs, save your money.I don't recommend."
5,Brilliant.,"Awesome sound, beautiful finish. My favourite 18"" crash by far. Especially considering the less-than-half-price price.Word of warning, though - you can't choose what finish you get, i.e. silver, gold, hammered, etc. But if that's okay with you as it was for me, go ahead and buy it now."
5,great book,wanted to start collection of her books and this is the first of the few she did write. Hopefully more will be found.
3,Not enough for my taste but worth a look.,"While I was a bit disappointed in this movie it still kept me watching till the end. When the movie began I thought I might have to shut it off and watch some crap on t.v., but as the movie progressed I found myself sitting through it to see where it would go. That being said sadly the movie did not go where I thought it should have. I felt there was not enough information to make a some what interesting story more compelling. While this movie didn't quite deliver for me it is still worth a look for the right price. The sad thing is this could have been a great horror movie, instead it fell way short."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I'd read so many negative reviews of this film that i was afraid to try it. However, I gambled and it paid off with a very unusual plot line, great production and some good scares. If you're sick of the teens-getting-killed-off-one-by-one plot, this is the film for you. Nazis, the occult, ancient rune stones, immortality, farmers held prisoner on their own land, and victims getting their revenge all play a role."
4,Better than expected,"Blood Creek was much better than I was led to believe,That's why I usually don't take movie advise from people unless they have my love for certain aspects of the genre.It was fast paced and somewhat original,the gore and effects were good enough to satisfy this hard core slasher lover.It didn't hurt that the two leading men are hot..Dominic Purcell and Henry Cavill both gorgeous and good actors as well.Actually all the acting in the movie was up to par.If you like slasher and zombie flicks this is right up your alley.These are quite different zombies than I have seen before,they're not afflicted with a virus or anything like that and it's quite entertaining the way they come about.This movie deals with the occult,undead Nazis,feeding on human blood for survival and immortality .I think it's a good entry in this years Horror pool.I will watch it again."
2,Not worth Red Box $1.08,"If someone lets you borrow it for free, maybe. Nah, go do something outdoors instead. There are better documentaries on history channel about the Nazi's fascination with the occult. This just didnt do anything for me."
4,Blood Creek,"I wanted to see this movie, Blood Creek because I like the actor Henry Cavill. I found the movie creepy. Which is a good thing. Freaked me, had trouble sleeping after watching. Love the third eye.."
2,"Different, yes, but could have been MUCH better","Saw the trailer and thought ""Joel Schumacher"" (Batman and Robin/Batman Forever). Neat premise and story combining the supernatural, occult, Nordic history and Nazi. (Okay, then.) Anyway, bad editing and bad acting made for a confusing story with unfortunate sequel possibilities. People doing stupid things to advance the story. To it's credit nice special effects and gore. Now, I know why it never made it to the big screen. My personal thanks to the executive who made that decision to spare the general public. If you've run out of things to watch on a lazy afternoon, this'll do. But no need to hurry."
1,A big disappionment,"I was always happy with the Amazon purchase until this order. The item doesn't play all the way after the half of the movie, It's just frozen. I tried many times in case there is something wrong with my DVD player, but the oher DVDs were playing just fine expecpt this movie. I'm very disappointed and sad that should not be experiened since I really trust this website. I want to gain my trust back. :("
4,DEADLY RUNES,"Although filmed in Romania, this film is set in Morgan County, WV which is where I have lived for three years which of course sparked my interest.This is a change of pace for director Joel Schumacher (Phantom of the Opera, Flatliners, Lost Boys)and it's a decent--though often muddled--horror flick. It has a despicable villain played byn INGLORIOUS BASTERD's Michael Fassbender and gallant heroes embodied by PRISON BREAK's Dominic Purcell and THE TUDORS Henry Cavill. It has an original plot and a creepy atmosphere and an open-ended climax screaming for a sequel. Above average horror."
4,Better than most theatre scary movies,"This was a great, fast-paced scary movie with an interesting plot. It's a lot better than a lot of theater releases that I've seen in the past couple of months. Dominic Purcell plays his role well and so does Henry Cavill as the brother who watches over his nephews. It had really great special effects and was just overall very well done. Definitely give it a shot, but I have a feeling this will be one of those very underrated awesome movies."
3,Blood Creek,"I think this movie is O.K. The topic is good, but the delivery seems a little lacking. The first part started out interesting, but turned out not so good during the later parts of the film. Thanks."
4,perfect rice very time!,"We use this rice cooker 6 times a week for about 1 year now. Perfectly cooked rice every time. Easy to use, has timer so you can set it up to have rice ready by certain time. It cooks rice congee as well, very handy. I never used its steam feature though.I would prefer the removable inner cover for easy clean (My old one has a removable cover)."
2,Why is this so hard,"I had the previous version of this software (ARCserve IT) and it was very difficult to make work and I encountered errors all the time. This software is no easier than the last one to configure. In fact after many e-mails with their tech support and weeks of working on this, I still can't even submit a job without an error. At this point I am going to move to some other software for my backup (maybe Veritas).This product appears to be very powerful, and if you can make it work, or if you are in an extremely advanced backup situation it may be what you need and an outstanding backup too, but for me it just is too much, and too difficult."
2,Smells different!,"I am normally used to buying this very same stuff from department stores (mostly Dillards) and sometimes at the duty free shops at the airports, I was suprised to find that this smells pretty different from the ones I bought in the stores which was much better. Not sure if I will ever buy these online again."
4,Great Fragrance,"This is one my favorite fragrances currently, its' very unique and not everyone has it. When you first spray it, It does have that medicinal smell to it, but it quickly goes away after 15 min. Then I just smell spicey and incense like, eventually after the dry down it has a vanilla scent to it. This has great sillage (Last from 7PM to 7AM next day).I wear this more when I am going out then a daily wear. I don't see this working well during the day in the summer, but at night it's fine and def. a winter fragrance feel to it. Overall if anyone feels like having a spicey scent. Get it. Also, I always buy from Amazon so not to get screwed by random stores. If you get the clear bottle one it's M7 Fresh not M7."
1,Dull and boring,"This book is pointless, boring and a waste of paper. Bunch of anthropologists sharing their tepid ruminations."
5,Easy Avery MAC LabelPro,"I have used Avery Mac LabelPro for several years(Ver 1.64) and have found it the best labeling program that money can buy! The new version, 1.74, is a continuation in quality and performance of version 1.64. It is easy to use, accurate in placement and concise. Easy to use and logical in function, I would venture to call this a ""must have utility"" for any computer buff using either Mac or PC compatible!"
3,Wax is hard to remove,"I bought this product in order to remove unwanted facial hair and to shape my eyebrows, but I didn't get further than my upper lip because it left so much wax behind that it required some extraordinary scrubbing to remove it; and I couldn't imagine doing that to my eye area. The product worked okay where I used it but I now have lots of small bumps from the wax residue.If you have tough skin then this item would probably work well for you. I rated it 3 stars because it accomplished the hair removal. Unfortunately it also accomplished skin removal."
4,Need extra stripe,"Good buy for the price, satisfied. Although we needed an extra strap to feel that the bikes are attached securely. Also we have small SUV (Highlander) and are not sure, if we should have the rack rested against the window glass or car's body just below the windshield wiper."
2,Okay for short trips but doesn't always stay on,"Depending on the type of car you have, it is a bit hard to put on and make sure it stays on. I recently took it for a 2 hour trip...it stayed on the way there but shift on the way back. The instruction manuel is not very clear on how to put it on the car model I have."
5,Works great.....good price,"Easy instructions, got it very quickly. It took me maybe 15 minutes to figure out how to adjust it for my car the first time, but now it just takes a couple of minutes to put it on by myself. Great quality, very sturdy. I've only had 2 bikes on it so far, but they both fit fine."
3,Okay rack,"The rack works well enough, but they need to do a better job of letting you know what models it fits. There is a list once you purchase the product, but by then it's too late. Turns out mine will fit, but is not recommended. So it's a tad noisy and doesn't fit quite right."
2,Be careful,"I bought this book (an earlier edition) in 2000 and did some kind of ""relationship ending/breakup"" chant because I was unhappy in my relationship. The NEXT day my boyfriend got into a car accident! He broke his leg but was otherwise OK thank God but to this day I still feel like it was somehow my fault because of that chant. Oh and not only that but we didn't actually break up until about a year later.Oh and the chant words are very difficult to say and yes they really should have a pronunciation guide. Maybe if you say them wrong they have a different effect than what you expect."
3,a chant for every occasion,"I bought this book many years when I used to dabble in the occult. I don't know if the chants work or not, because I never tried them. How could I? I had no way of knowing how to properly pronounce them. This book, if it is ever reprinted, seriously needs a pronunciation guide or phonetic spellings of the chants. Shame on Ray Buckland and his publisher for not thinking of this in the first place. It also would have been nice if Ray Buckland would have included the traditions of the chants and where and how he acquired them."
4,Works Like Magic,"I bought this book years ago and was very surprised by the results. I did a chant to heal my sick dog and it worked. She got better within days of the chant. I also tried a chant to make myself gain special abilities and it also worked for a time. I gained psychic powers. I had visions of things before they happened. I know that sounds crazy but it's true. To this day, I still have remnants of those abilities. I dont have the book anymore cause I loaned it to a friend and never got it back but I would love to buy it again. It was an amazing book. But be very careful. The chants DO work. So be careful what u are wanting. But I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to get into the arts and make some of their dreams come true. Just be very careful. The only downfall is the pronunciation's arent very good. Some chants are hard to say."
3,"didn't work at first,second,third and fouth try,but it did work on the 6th try.","wish I can change my rate on this book to 5 because,I tried it 5 times and didn't work, asked around for help including the writer, the 6th time I tried it, it worked! I was amazed,I'm not even an expert,that's why I bought another copy of this book.it's a must have."
5,Superb Reference Book,"I was recently doing a research paper on the fall of Vietnam under Communism. This book has more than just the history of medals and decorations from the Vietnam era, but gives precise details on how the war began to French forces to when the Americans pulled out. This is a very complete, beautiful color guide to all Republic of Vietnam Military and Civilian decorations, medals, ribbons and unit awards. It includes all Vietnamese civilian awards and their different classes with pictures and descriptions of all the medals of the Vietnamese Allies."
3,An Exciting Conclusion,"While this action in this book starts out slow, it picks up in the end, and was an enjoyable read. Alafair Burke is the daughter of novelist James Lee Burke, one of my favorite authors, and seems to be a chip off the old block."
2,Not enough butter for the bread,"This book has the basics just fine. But nothing on the more experienced side. If your trails require fording you find no help here. Tent training, protecting tent floor & inflatable sleeping mattress from dog's nails etc stuff are missing.The best part of the book was dog's health checkup, signs of dehydration, paw hardening recipe etc.Conclusion: If your hike lasts a day, the book is fine. If it lasts a week in the wilderness, your dogs will be in trouble unless you find some more information."
5,My husband actually finished reading it,My hubby isn't the type to read for pleasure. I was surprised when this book caught his eye and kept his interest.Book has pretty useful and humorous advice to prepare you for baby. We are happy with this purchase.
2,Very very simple,"The book feels as if it were written for men who have never heard of the concept of babies. If that is where you're starting then this would be a great book to start with.Pros: Quick and easy read, Interesting organization, Will make a good table level.Cons: A bit too basic"
5,Perfect for new dads or dads-to-be!,I bought this for my husband maybe 3-4 months after we found out we were expecting. I'm reading more serious/typical books & this one was recommended for men. He loves it! He was touched I thought of him too & has loved reading the info for new dads. It's an easy read & he's actually learning things from it!
1,Don't waste your time and money,"This book is a bit rIdiculous and very, very annoying. The author truly thinks very highly of himself and this is reflected in his writing. The advice is trite and commonplace. I'm sure that the author is a cool guy to hang out with (?maybe) but it sure doesn't come across in his writing. He tries to hard to be a ""cool dad"" however the goal of providing real-life, useful advice to new fathers is lost by this. I am very disappointed by this book and reading it was not only a time sink but was also just plain ANNOYING! Do yourself a favor and keep looking for better books in this category."
1,Poor Advice,"This book was unfortunately not what my husband expected. At times, it is very demeaning toward women & the experiences they go through during pregnancy. He stopped reading it after we were both insulted when we read that the father should bring a boom box to the delivery room. Seriously, a boom box? This is not a serious nor helpful book for fathers."
2,Real Average...don't trust all the reviews,"I'm not one of those guys to review everything I buy at Amazon. But given that I bought this book based on the good reviews I had, I thought it would make sense to clear the air.My overall opinion is this book is semi funny...but thats about all its got going for it. Its real simple and not very comprehensive. Its a quick read, which makes it work for a lot of guys that review this book. But that is deceiving. If your a new dad, you want a lot of information so you can really know what to expect. If your one of those guys, this book is not for you...as it was not for me."
5,This book was hilarious!!!!!,My husband and I loved this book! It described our lives with our new baby to at T! It was right on the money! This would be the perfect stocking stuffer for new parents. Thanks.
4,Nice,"I bought this for my husband, it was more of a quick comical read, not necessarily medical or terribly informative. Its a small book, good for plane reading. If you're looking for more factual information, I would buy the Expectant Father."
5,AWESOME,I got this book for my husband and also my best friends husband.. I wanted to read it first and HOLY COW this book was awesome! I loved the way how blunt and straight to the point in man terms this book was written.. HIGHLY recommend!!!!
3,cheated!!,"The title is incredibly misleading; you'd think you're getting the 1970s notorious TV appearances--you're not. No Interviews, no Bill Grundy, no BBC TV...this is just another rehash of their newer concert footage. Same 'era' as ""There'll Always Be An England"". Nothing new here & no frills nor bonus materials. Sure, it's a great concert (even if John looks silly as hell in his leiderhosen & Oompa Loompa hair) but it's still really nothing new...Just wringing some more cash outta chaos, that's all. A dud."
3,Whatever happened to quality control?,"Out of six nibs in the package, two didn't fit the enclosed holders properly -- one fit too loosely and the other wouldn't stay in at all. I'm not interested in trying any more Speedball products if this is how they work."
3,most nibs stunk,"only one nib really wrote well, and one was good for bluping for filling in other the rest were scratchy and hated to release ink"
3,I found this DVD satisfactory.,"Though, I just bought this a few weeks ago I found it to be satisfactory to what we already seem to know. I wanted it in my collection because it is a part of my interest that will never cease. Some footage was new and informative and I wanted to know even more. I love the cover photo and I miss Michael very much."
3,OK,"I just never trusted Jermaines agenda to do anything at all thats good for MJ. The DVD mostly says what everyone else has already heard. Not much new stuff other than he is saying it. All about DR. Murray...his drug problems....nothing new, just a way for Jermaine to cash in, in my opinion...."
5,These knives are great!,"I have used these products for many years. The knives are so sharp and so good. They sharpen easily with the inexpensive, made just for Rada sharpeners. The vegetable peeler is wonderful. They stay sharp for many years. And, they are made in the USA! I heartily recommend these products. Now that they've added the black handles, I'm buying them for wedding shower gifts, as well. The aluminum handles do discolor in the dishwasher."
3,Took two shots but sneaked in before Christmas,"I ordered this set with plenty of lead time to make it a stocking stuffer. What came was a single tomato slicer with a return address of ""Santa"" so there was no way of knowing what was in the package. The vendor agreed to replace the wrong shipment and sent it out with a guaranteed delivery date. USPS or vendor fault? I don't know. But the package did NOT arrived when guaranteed. It did arrive late on Christmas Eve so it did drop into the stocking that night. The products are nothing special and look like the ones you can buy at the county and state fairs. We will have to see how they hold up.Oh! The vendor ""suggested"" that I consider rewriting my first review because they had tried so hard to please me in the busy holiday shipping hassles. That alone was enough to not suggest using them again."
5,RADA,Excellent kitchen product. Have shared this brand of knives with several friends and all comment they are glad they bought the same product. Have bought several for wedding gifts.
5,Rada Cutlery made in USA.,There is something to be said about RADA CUTLERY .. THIS IT THE BEST CUTLERY I HAVE EVER USED. MADE IN USA IS A PLUS. ALL COOKS SHOULD HAVE THE CUTLERY
4,Disappointed,The product was not packaged to prevent breakage. One container had broken open and the cheese was all over the box when opened. The cheese is good
4,Funny horror?,"Reminiscent of the Mr. Vampire movies of the 1980's but with a modern feel and stars the ""Twins"" Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung, both of whom are cute and fun to watch. The last reviewer did a fine job of describing this film, especially since it IS very much like House on Haunted Hill where you don't know what is really supernatural and what is a plot to get the inheritance money. But I just wanted to put my 2 cents in and say I liked it very much, as well. It was funny yet still spooky, gives some insight into Chinese culture-the modern mixed with past customs, and just a good time to watch and see what happens.All in all, it is well worth seeing if you can wrap your brain around the idea of comedy and horror sharing one genre in a film."
4,bach flowers remedies for women,"I read this book just at the time I was running into some ""women troubles"" and it was so helpful ! I read more general books on bach flowers before and use them routinely, but there is nothing like something applying directly to YOUR situation ! Definitely a reference book for me."
1,Very Lame,"I'm a huge Bon Jovi fan and have nearly everything they've done on tape or DVD, but this DVD was pretty damn lame. I have to echo everything said in the last review. You know it's going to be pretty bad when they have a disclaimer at the outset that it's unauthorized and that no music played in the video is from the band. There is little footage of the band and most of the footage is poorly filmed interviews with people of little importance or consequence to the band. Their observations are truly laughable. Don't waste your money, this is the worst."
1,IT [is bad],I received mine as a gift.... Save your money or if you feel like wasting money give to a charity. Just some company trying to get your money using Bon Jovi to do it. Don't let them.
1,Not worth the plastic its made of...,"This DVD is the worst one I have ever seen. It's no wonder it is 'unauthorised' story - the band would never release a product with quality as low as this.True fans will find nothing new. New fans, watch for VH1's behind the music to re-air - it does a far better job at telling the band's story."
1,Do not buy this DVD...,"I had bought this dvd, 'cause it looked interesting... But it isn't. It talks only about john, the other members are mentioned maybe three or four times... It doesn't talk about their private life and it is full of mistakes. You won't discover nothing new... No revealed secrets, no interesting interviews."
5,Awesome Book,"Ms. Perrodin's book I Refuse To Be Broke was very informative to me as a reader. I Refuse To Be Broke helped to reinforce some of the things I already knew about the importance of being a good steward with God's money. Ms. Perrodin's book has a lot of key principles to obtain financial success. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for financial direction.Veronica AzardLafayette, La"
5,Thinline modem works fine,"I have a Handspring VISOR Delux and just got my thincom modem. It worked just fine with my AOL for Palm software and did work with thier included applications. Only shortfall, the included apps are ALL demos and you get about 10 to 15 days to demo. Also, they are slightly confusing to work with since they require odd usernames to work even in demo mode.But if you have mail software in your PDA or the AOl software it works like a charm."
5,A mustsee documentary,The dangers of hydrofracking are clearly laid out and should be required viewing for all residents of potential drilling sites.
1,Mother Fracking Fraud,"Be advised that this movie is completely fraudulent. Fox never owned the land he said he was offered money for, he photocopied a farmer's advocacy group's mineral rights lease, claiming that it was one presented to him by the drilling company rep, the flaming water scene...staged and according to the EPA (historically liberally sympathetic) his water is completely free of contaminants and when asked to reproduce the ""coffee water"" he fails, and later angrily refuses. He fails to mention that flammable water (or methane in the water) has been around for much longer than fracking, both in the films region and as a drilling technology in general.This isn't even ""questionable"" its an outright fraud (almost comically). AND HBO has funded a 2nd film..... I wonder if it will be a romantic comedy about Fox's love affair with spreading misinformation.For an accurate film about Fracking, or more specifically, to see and hear this film torn apart yourself, watch the new film ""FrackNation"""
2,"Awesome subject material, ANNOYING narration","The narrator was mumbling and trying to either sound dramatic, mysterious, or sexy. Failed on all accounts. I got about halfway through it and couldn't take it anymore.Speak CLEARLY and ENUNCIATE next time. Please. For the sake of your movie/cause. I kept thinking this was a college project or a long commercial spot. We know you don't normally speak like that because you talk perfectly fine while interviewing people.And just to be clear, I am definitely *not* pro-fracking. I'm glad this movie got made. Just wish I was deaf while watching it.Rant over, go ahead and speak your peace."
1,Poor quality in production and presentation,"Overall informative but lacks more global picture of the impact of fracking, and the overall quality and presentation is not very good."
1,gasline,"""Gasland"" Was full of misinformation, half truths, central issue was not fully covered,and too sensationalizing; Film maker seemed just to want to make a controversial film without doing ""his homework"" on the subject. One needs to watch ""Truthland"" for a more balance overview of this topic. Pros and cons are revealed in a non- sensationalized presentation. As with any endeavor, it is the operator,manager,company,and/or president following guidelines and regulations or not following rules and regulations which can lead into unsatisfactory results."
5,Everyone should share this film with friends.,Please pass this movie on! We need to inform everyone we know about this. This technology will turn America into a 3rd world country.
4,It opened my eyes,"I realized that fracking was causing pollution of the water supply, but not that people had no legal recourse. We are killing our planet in the name of cheap energy."
5,Gasland,"Absolutely amazing work, Josh and his crew are very talented and deliver a wealth of information that the public needs to know about the Natural Gas and Oil industry and our Government. All TV channels need to present this to the viewing public."
1,"Loved, then hated","I absolutely loved this movie, until I saw Fracknation. When I saw Fracknation my first thought was what a bunch of right wing bullcrap. Then after doing some research and actually fact checking Gasland I've discovered while Fox might have had good intent in his heart he filled a movie with lies, deceit, and downright harmful information. Unfortunately thousands of people's lives will suffer b/c of this movie. On top of that Russia will still have a stranglehold on the eastern world.Plus most of the farmers where this would take place are living month to month trying not to sell the family farm. Many, too many, of them have had to sell. This farmland and forest is now being developed into neighborhoods and complexes. That sounds even worse for the environment!"
1,Ridiculous Propaganda,Don't waste your time with this propaganda. This movie is a documentary about fracking in the same way that Jaws is a documentary about sharks.
5,Watch and Act,"Thank you for bring this to us Josh Fox.Corporations and their greed clearly don't care about the people, birds and animals they are impacting with fracking with their soup of toxic chemicals.I just became an activist.Chris"
4,Gasland,I thought it was worth 4 stars because I think it enlightens the people to the dangersof fracking and the carelessness of those on the job. The color in the film could haveused some improvement. It was quite dark.
4,Essential and ethical,"In spite of the greenhouse gases produced by the use of natural gas we must be pleased that so much is available here. However as Gasland shows lts procurement must be done ethically. The method must be modified if harm is being done to water supplies, air,environment e.g. earthquakes,light and sound pollution, destruction of roads. Industry must realise that there is room for improvement in their operations. Gasland brings these evils to the attention of citizens, who have a vote."
1,Lies and falsehoods,Really poorly done. This is for people who know nothing about anything and will believe anything. Doesn't even go into detail about the process. A total smear job.
1,Just Stupid,"This is a poorly informed propaganda film. There are many areas of the country where oil and gas has naturally seeped into the fresh water table or even to surface. Let's remember that oil was first discovered in American in Pennsylvania in 1859 at ""Oil Creek"" -- called that because oil naturally seeped into the creek's water. Indians would actually skim oil from the surface of the water. Most early oil exploration around the world was based on finding surface seeps of oil and gas. Surface seepages of oil and gas have been well-documented in the northeast United States and other parts of the country for literally hundreds of years. The idea that all of sudden these seeps are caused by fracturing natural gas wells is completely absurd. The most amazing thing about this movie is that anyone could give it a shred of credibility. It's just stupid."
1,terrible lies,"Lie lie lie. this is what you get from someone with no actual knowledge. flaming water from the tap? that is from their unregulated water wells. wells that traverse numereous coal seams, hence the methane."
1,Scare tactics,Totally inaccurate with myths and fairy tales the likes of which would increase or dependence on foreign oil and flush our economy down the toilet. If you buy into this hype the terrorists win
5,"Flaming Fire Faucet's Right Here, Cool !?",You've probably seen the videos of people turning on their water and lighting fire to it already on youtube. Now please get the whole story and watch this movie Josh fell into making after he learned he could be next.
4,Fire land!,This eye-opening documentary from a few years ago really explains the dangers about fracking and Natural Gas drilling in easy to understand terms. Well worth the view!
5,Outstanding,"Outstanding terrifying and brilliant! A must see if you love this country, it's wildlife and what we are doing to harm what we should be protecting."
5,Very scientific and informative. Not overly melodramatic like some other socio-enviro-political documentaries.,"A very well done documentary. All information is presented in a practical, empirical, and scientific manner. I dislike a lot of other social, environmental, and political documentaries because they over-dramatize the presentation of events and facts so that it detracts from the important messages and information. This film follows through on every point in a logical manner, starting with the various causes of the problems and drawing all the lines to the various ramifications. The narrator allows you to see his own process of learning and discovery. If you didn't care about how gas is harvested before, you will after seeing this. Sure gas burns clean but the manner in which its being extracted now is just as damaging to people and environment as any other fossil fuel."
5,"Eye opening ""Gasland""",This film should be seen by everyone. It's really eye opening to understand the long lasting damage fracking can inflict upon the environment.
3,May not be complete story,"Pretty one sided, although the documentary claims that this is because no one from the industry would comment. There are rumors that some/many of those households had water issues pre-fracking. Whether that is true or not is the question here. Overall, there is a lot more information that must be examined to determine the pros and cons of our current search for energy independence."
2,"Too long, too much FUD.","This documentary should have been no longer than 45 minutes. While the director was a very interesting person, the documentary just seemed to go on and on. This movie relies heavily on lighting tap water aflame, rather than interviews with scientists. While illuminating, this documentary seems to lean heavily toward Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt rather than scientific analysis. That said, there are some scary scenes in this film - but nothing that would surprise anyone with a basic 1-minute description of how the hydraulic fracturing process works.I was very surprised and disappointed that this film did not cover the relationship of hydraulic fracturing to earthquakes."
5,A must see true story,"If you live in America, have any concern about the environment, care any at all about others, and/or desire to have good health, then this is a must see show. Very educational, entertaining, enlightening, and benefical. A first class production. Hopefully, this documentary will help bring about positve change in protecting us."
5,Everyone should see this film!,"This film puts the lie to ""clean natural gas."" ""They're taking a beautiful piece of country and turning it into a big trash dump."" Who's ""they""? It's not the people who have to live near the wells, breathe the toxic fumes, drink contaminated water, or try to raise crops and animals on contaminated land. Gasland shows how the wealthy few are stealing the lives and livelihoods of the unpowerful many backed by the bought or at least unfeeling politicians. What is wrong with us? I highly recommend this film."
5,Gasland...a masterpiece!!!!,"Gasland is an artistic masterpiece! This tour de force dismantles the argument that natural gas is the new bridge fuel and in fact cleaner than coal. Josh Fox's chilling revelations of the impact of natural gas drilling and fracking includes a decidedly frightening look at ordinary citizens who have water that can be literally set on fire. Gasland features a well written narration as well as a beautifully sequenced pace which creates a work of art as well as a meaningful revelation of a very complex subject. Gasland could be as significant as ""Silent Spring."""
5,A must see movie,I saw the movie while on vacation and it was just so stunning I had to get it and show my friends/
5,Hard-hitting Meets Brutally Honest,"This isn't a film most of us would expect to see. In fact, there are many people who'd rather not know or who would refute it's content vehemently. The idea that we would essentially destroy our water sources for profit is incomprehensible - the kind of thing reserved for only the most foolhardy among us. Couldn't happen, right? This work documents exactly what happens when greed is permitted to override the greater good. It's a ""must see"" for anyone old enough to know better."
1,APPALLING AMATEUR FOOTAGE,The film is so badly done it completely takes away from the importance of the story. This is such a critical issue which has been turned into amateur hour.Please ask Michael Moore to make a doco that people can sit through without feeling sick because of the constantly moving camera. How it ever won a review or got watched is nothing short of a miracle.
1,More lib-agenda hype to paralyze,"This film deals with a situation, sometimes just the reality, but basically a HYPE intended to fulfill the Democrat Party's need for more votes and the typical fear that cajoles the ""ignorant"" into compliance. This IS a ""real review"". Beware the Anti-American Liberal Agenda. The Democrats are bringing America to its knees. Who ""owns"" this place anyway!? Saudis? A muslim President in the White House doing NOTHING to create jobs, etc. ""Wake up, sleeper! Rise from the dead."""
1,Bunk,"Most folks that I know that tried to watch this movie fell asleep before the end. Save your money, or get a real documentary like Dear Zachary."
1,It's all about Agenda,"Not as bad as Al Gore's Globel Warming lies. But still lacking in factual info. We must save mother earth. we are killing ourselves and our mother. Man is evil. Earth is good. You people fall for anything. That's why we have Obama and the mess we're in now.This hippie is a big Greenie Weenie. Frighten the masses with Doom and Gloom. Hooks em' everytime. Look where Hope and Change has gotten you. And please, That old mantra ""Bush and Cheney's Fault is wearing thin.Think for yourselves and get your info somewhere other than a left leaning movie. Oscar winner? Forest Gump was an Oscar winner. It doesn't mean he was a real person or a true story. Sorry I ruined it for some of you. So was Algore's movie and the facts in that were all fudged. These movies should be classified "" Fantasy"""
5,Great Book,Okay this was a great book but i have a lot of questions.Like on the next book who is on the cover? Is it Chris? Well it was a great book and i'm so happy chris & parker got back together i hope they make the write decisions!! I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Michelin North America Road Atlas,"Very Disappointing! I was not expecting a Michelin Road Atlas to be using Mapquest maps! I thought your 1:500,000 maps of the Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England areas were outstanding. I consider this atlas to be only mediorce at best. I hope you reconsider and use your own expert cartography in your next edition."
4,One of the most well-written mysteries I've read,"Excellent. The only reason this book receives four stars as opposed to five is the sadness of the story. The prose is very fine. Although intellectually one can realize a few flaws (a few very convenient plot points and cliches), they do not take away in the least from the intuitional impact. The descriptions of Venice are also great, and accurate, if overly melancholy, according to my father, a former resident. Read it, but not on a gloomy day."
3,Bradbury's trip into mystery,"Bradbury's novel Death is a Lonely business, a thriller packed with eye boggling mystery and mayhem, is the most bizarrly interesting mystery novel I have ever encountered. The story takes place in 1950's Venice, California where the protagonist, a struggling young author, teams up with a sly detective and a reclusive actress to solve a series of horrific murders that have haunted the usually surreal communtiy. The reason I chose to give this novel a mediocre rating is its procrastinated plot development, making the story very boring at times."
2,Slightly Better Than Pulp,"I found the book to be rather dull. The descriptions of decaying Venice (CA) were more pedestrian than evocative, and I had to supply a lot of imagination to flesh out the mental picture I was supposed to be getting. The plot was also not particularly distinctive. By far the most interesting moments came when I briefly suspected one of the major characters, but when the real perpetrator was discovered it seemed too pat. Considering some of the fine work being done these days in mystery writing (especially by those who, like Bradbury, don't do it exclusively), this is a minor opus indeed."
5,Excellent semi-autobiographical pulp-noir detective story,Ray Bradbury's ability to craft amazing prose shines through in this unheralded masterpiece of fiction. The way he wraps his life and his views on writing and the world into an entertaining exploration into the darker side of life in the 50's is superb. One of my all time favorite books. A must read for any true Bradbury fan.
3,A good album? Yes. A memorable one? No.,"I first heard Billy Seidel at the Milwaukee Summerfest in July 2000. I was impressed by his energy and stage presence. He sounded pretty darn good too. That enthusiasm and audience connection isn't thoroughly represented on CD, however, the The Moon and the Stars serves more as a tease to what a good performer Billy is than as a great album in its own right. It is a good album, however. Nice mid-tempo rockers mixed up with some bluesy numbers make for an enjoyable listen. The problem is that he sounds like a blend of all the Matchbox 20 style bands on the market right now and doesn't assert a distinct personality. A good album? Yes. A memorable one? No."
1,I wish I had been informed it was written for 10 year olds!,"This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. I found it to be very inacurate and totally uninformative,compared to other books in this category."
4,Useful as a first exposure,"If you are new to electronics and have no idea about circuits, transistors, diodes, antennas or even what these words really mean, this might be the right book for you. It introduces all these concepts, and lets you get exposed to them in a systematic way. However, the concepts may be introduced a bit haphazardly, and it's not always easy to see how all the material fits together. The book is also filled with exercises and quizzes, and these may be the most worthwhile aspects of the books. Nonetheless, keep in mind that electronics is an empirical discipline, so the real learning happens with hands-on experience with building (and blowing up) of actual physical circuits. But if you are just interested in getting exposed to the basic concepts, this would be a good book to read."
4,Concise and practical,"There is plenty of content in each of the chapters, with excellent review exercises at the end.I had thought some chapters, eg. chapter 1, were a little too ""dense"" (material-laden), so don't be too put-off.Overall the book seems great value for money, at least for me, an enthusiastic beginner."
3,Good but not great,"This entry into the Disco Kandi series didn't really blow me away. The one before this one (05.02) was really good...this one just left me somewhat disapointed. Don't get me wrong there's some good cuts, but there's also quite a bit of filler too. Try to get it used."
1,The Decade You Were Born-The 40's,"A lot of industrial/military documentaries, interesting, but not worth a second viewing. I may be wrong, but wasn't there some sort of major world conflict going on in the 40's? If it was, this disc didn't seem to pay much attention to it."
3,"Music good, but...","The music is fine. If you're looking at this CD, it's old enough that you know that you like it. My criticism is the sound. I purchased this because the other available copy of ""Manorisms"" has just awful sound. It's like they recorded the CD from an old cassette. I thought this was remastered. It's not; its the same mix as before. It sounds like it's coming from a portable transistor radio.I wish Epic (or the band) would reissue the original CD remastered.On the other hand, this is a nice way to get this edition of the band on a single CD."
4,Feelgood Willie!!!!!!,"Wow...I just got this. I had Manorisms in high school but not the last album. Just didn't appreciate 'Weekend' at the time. But listening to it now, both albums are upbeat, feelgood albums..and you get them both on one Cd. I recommend this to all Jimmy Hall fans. Not the old Willie sound you know, but very fresh sounding to me now."
4,Great info on how to get started and stay successful,This book was recommended by a Atkin's online forum I had joined as the 'bible' for being successful on the Atkins diet program. The book does in fact contain all the information you will need to begin the program (ie the list of allowed foods during Induction) and explains the other three phases of adding more carbs back into your diet and staying successful at keeping the weight off for the rest of your life. I wish the introduction into the diet was not so long...there are quite a few pages before you will get to 'Phase I: Induction' but overall this book could be considered a must have for those who want to be long term successful at this diet.
1,Don't waste your money,"Having just finished reading the 2002 edition ofNew Diet Revolution and New Diet Cookbook, I can sum it by saying, ""Crackpot."""
5,Helped Me,This book certainly helped me go from a size 16 to a size 6. It was pretty difficult giving up my bad habits and giving up the foods I love most excruciatingly painful. But in the end I was amazed how the pounds melted away. Follow Dr. Atkins to a healthier life like I did.
4,very informative and easy to read,Certainly is food for thought as to why so many of us are obese. have used Dr Atkins techniques and have lost 15pounds. In 3 weeks. It was very easy and I was never starving once.
2,Uneffective,"Possibly owing to fact that I have no religious background especially in Judaism, I found this book a disaster. You truly need to be Jewish to understand over half the book. He rarely if ever explains most of the hebrew terms he is using so you are left in the dark about there meaning and importance. He jumps around a lot and rarely seems to have a cohesive idea that is easily discerneable."
5,An excellent introduction in modern Judaism,"This is a book that should be thoroughly studied by everyone who wants to learn something not only about modern Judaism, but also about modern Christianity. It gives a broad introduction in aspects of jewish tradition and life nowadays, as well as it is an excellent example of modern jewish hermeneutics. This book should be required reading in every theological education."
1,Beware of misleading advertising,"I bought the monitor because it was listed as both PC and Mac compatible. But the monitor apparently doesn't accept a digital video signal from Macs. It would've have been nice to know that before I spent the thousand bucks.BTW, I say ""apparently"" because the manual includes instructions only for connecting to the Mac's analog connector. I asked Neovo tech support to address this issue -- but they ignored my inquiry.I'll end on a positive note: Amazon.com's shipping was FAST."
5,Soon....,"I've ordered this and i havnt gotten it yet but, when i do....who-wa-dilly it's gonna be sweet!"
5,CHARMING but too short,"This is a delightful little book of memories from the author's life in small-town America. Each chapter was just fun to read. But there is so much more about this growing-up, and I hope Mr. Link is writing it! For example, there is almost no mention of school, and no mention of the murder that took place there that he wrote about in MURDER FOR BREAKFAST. Readers would also like to know more about his life and his brothers as they grew up. How did Mr. Link come to remain in his little town? Did the other surviving brothers stay there, too? So much more......... PLEASE, another book!"
3,Poor Skalkottas Great Kalomiris,"I have the exact opposite opinion to the undated unsigned review from GRAMMOPHONE. This is a poor recording of the cerebral, undigestible 12 note Symphony by Skalkottas and a very good recording of the exciting, youthful, exuberant 1st Symphony by Kalomiris. It is indeed an unlikely combination of works and styles and what brought them together was the late brilliant conductor and Vienna Academy professor Miltiades Caridis who had great respect for both Kalomiris and Skalkottas. To the constipated unknown Grammophone reviewer I say this : Kalomiris is the equal of Elgar and better than Vaughan Williams."
3,Wrapped inrain,"Found the story line to be a little far fetched, especially a person being sent home from a mental hospital with 2 injectable shots of Thorazine and a bottle of so called pills.The very explicate descriptions of a situation or a view I found to be long, they could have been more to the point.I had a hard time in reading the story and I had to force myself to finish."
3,Ehhhh. Heavy religious element.,"This has the makings of a good story but at times I felt that it was too religious and had some cloying elements that were unrealistic and sort of preachy. It is categorized as religious, which I didn't realize when I ordered it. I gave up because it just felt forced and insistent on a certain message."
2,Not a 5-Star book,"I've only read one other Charles Martin book, ""When Crickets Cry"" which I enjoyed very much. Therefore, I decided to read another by this author and our local library had a copy of ""Wrapped in Rain"". I can now rate this book a two because I didn't purchase it but instead checked it out from the library. Mr. Martin's writing can be very good, however, in this book he simply wallows in words - using every adjective he's ever used, wanted to use, read, seen, looked up in a dictionary, heard,(perhaps you can get the point from my overuse of verbs). I wanted to like this book, but I didn't. And because a friend and I read it out loud to each other the weakness in the writing, the character development, and the plot shone through easily. If I had it to do over again I'd have read another book. Do yourself a favor and read something else, like ""When Crickets Cry""."
5,very good book!,This is a definate read! It brought you right into the story and i thought i was there. If you are a nicholas sparks fan..... i think you will like Charles Martin.
3,Wrapped in Rain,"Raised by a wealthy, yet abusive father, Tucker is struggling to overcome his past. With the voice of his nanny, Miss Ella, in his head, he attempts to do the right things in life. One stormy night he stops to help a car that has become stuck in the mud, only to discover that it is a girl from his past. A girl who is running from her abusive ex-husband with her son in tow. Further, Tucker's brother Mutt, escapes from the mental hospital where he has been staying the past seven years.The author alternated between first point-of-view to third point of view depending on which character he was addressing. I found this to be a bit annoying and would have preferred one writing style throughout the entire book. Further, the characters seemed a bit stereotypical and their actions were predictable. Overall, I didn't think the book was bad, but I wouldn't re-read it."
5,No Pit So Deep,"Wrapped in Rain beautifully illustrates the saying, ""No pit is so deep that God's love is not deeper still."" Wonderful book. I don't have enough adjectives to do it justice. Charles Martin's stories embody all the best in Southern fiction: lyrical prose, quirky characters, a sense of child-like wonder. I pray the Lord allows him to continue writing for years to come."
3,Just okay......,"It's true, the author uses a variety of descriptive techniques and at times I enjoyed this. However, there were times that he simply went on and on describing a situation or event that did nothing to add to the story line.Also, some of the characters were very stereotyped which really irritated me. For example: The entire Dixie, Missy, Rocco account.....what was that? It was 9 pages of rambling about these people that did not add anything to the storyline. And it took 11 pages to tell us about his stop at Bessies gas station.While the spiritual aspect was weaved throughout the book, the concept of Ms.Ella speaking to them from heaven is not Biblically sound and quite often, bordered on blasphemy."
5,Wrapped in Rain,Wonderful story!! I could not put the book down! I recommend this for anyone. charles Martin is a great author!
3,"Not my type of book, but it was an okay read. . . . .","This is not my type of book but I seem to be picking out faith/religious books to read lately.The storyline is okay which is basically it IS okay to go home again, but I wish the author would have written more on the background of the two boys. What happened to the mother? Why didn't anyone report the abuse? Lots of ""whys"" but not any answers. Again, this is not my type of book so I look for different things in a book and Mr. Martin seems to over describes relatively minor things that doesn't suit the purpose. Some issues he skims over and exponds on others. It didn't make much sense to me.Hopefully I will start choosing books that are more to my liking."
2,Couldn't get into it,I will admit I did not get very far in this book. I've tried many times to read it. I just can't get past how it jumped from Tucker as a small boy to suddenly his brother in a mental hospital. I know this book has had high reviews. I wish I could of gotten into it.
3,"Great Premise, Not-so-Great delivery","Wrapped in Rain is hard to read, even if you can get past the hopping from living to dead people conversations that make very little sense at best, and at worst are the epitome of ho-hum clichés.Two boys with a horrible father are raised by their nanny, who dies and from the grave comes to their rescue with her home-spun advice over the years. One brother is successful but emotionally lost, the other brother is supposedly insane.I really wanted to like this book--the premise is wonderful--but the delivery falls flat. Despite that, the book has its moments of clarity, but unfortunately, not enough of them.I felt muddled and befuddled most of the time, and when I'd have to put the book away and come back to it later, I'd have to skim back over the previous pages to catch up.Aside from the Biblical cant that intersperses the tale, and the over-the-top dialogue, the book was difficult to read because the characters changed 'character' a lot."
3,Hard to Get Into,"I had to force myself to keep reading this book. It wasn't until about Chapter 12 that I started to enjoy it. Spare yourself, don't buy it."
3,Very Sad,"I found it terribly hard to even get thru the first hundred pages of this book. Tucker and his younger brother Mutt were raised by their housekeeper, Miss Ella Rain. These boys were motherless and had an abusive father.Tucker becomes an internationally famous photographer while his brother Mutt escapes after spending seven years in a mental hospital. Tucker must return home an face his own tragic past. Sorry to say it is not a book I would recommend."
3,Wrapped in Rain,I have not read this book yet. It is the selection for my book club for March. It arrived in good shape and I'm looking forward to getting into it. Thanks for the good service.
5,5* for me!,"If you like ""in your face"", clean and heroic playing, this is the one! This ""performance"" makes my hair stand on end, nostrils flare, and blood boil. True, maybe not as nuanced as others, but the Berlin guys are right ON."
4,Coax Cable Stripper RG-58,"The cable stripper does exactly what it is suppose to do. However, it is important that the user calibrate the blades using a sample of the Coax that they are actually going to use."
3,Nothing Special About It,"Most of the remixes are dull and fail to present an interesting interpretation of the original ""Danse Macabre"" album.I was especially disappointed with the remix of ""Glass Danse""- I expected someone like Paul Oakenfold to do a better job.The only remix that really stands out is ""Let the Poison Spill"" by Tommie Sunshine. It transforms the original song in a very refreshing way, totally taking out the gloomy atmosphere of the original and turning it into something uplifting and danceable.On the whole, this is an album you can listen to but there's nothing special about it.I recommend buying the unmixed ""Danse Macabre"" instead (if you don't have it already...)"
4,More Bang for the Buck,"Danse Macabre was a great cd but the remixes just had more zing if you're into pushing your subs to their fullest. It's more of an ear candy release. It's like.. ""lets take the Faint and turn the songs into something that would be a good soundtrack for a nightclub scene in some action flick"". Danse Macabre is more for my indoor listening pleasure and the remixes are for the car when I like to rattle windows as I drive by. Just two different ways to enjoy the Faint."
2,Don't try to fix it.,"As with almost any remix disc, die hard fans of the original won't like it. This album was no exception. The only reason that this album is not totally horrible is the fact that they have a great foundation. While Danse Macabre is an amazing CD, the remixes seem to be nothing but club/techno cuts of some amazing songs, focusing more on consistent beats and overworked build-ups than on the vocals. The only thing this album didn't fail to do was rob The Faint of their original ""ectroclash/industrial"" sound. If you can make it past the first song, the rest of the album doesn't sound as bad. While the trite nightclub beats and mainstream pop mixes almost cloud out the original intent, they still remain The Faint."
2,More Harm Than Good,"This album disappointed me greatly. I felt that each remix detracted from the original. I think a remix should either improve on the original or transform the original into something new and captivating, which is just not happening on this album. The one exception is ""Posed To Death"" (remix by The Calculators). The interweaving male and female vocals complement eachother beautifully. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is monotonous, shallow and poorly composed."
1,you didn't get the only bad apple,thought the phone looked very cool. liked the price too! but when i opened the box....it was missing the spot to attach the phone line. so the other reviewer did not get the only bad apple.
1,Maybe I got the one bad apple....,but the phone I received had nowhere to plug in the handset.There was just one jack on the bottom of the base where you plug the phone into the phone jack.Did I get the one bad apple in the barrel?
4,One for the conspiracy theorists,"Another great Lee Child read.This one is full of a conspiracy theorists dreams. Militia, crooked government, military trying to steal our rights and so on. In the middle of it all, Reacher manages to do all the stuff we have come to know he can do and in the most deadly efficient of ways. I just read this and bought the next one in the series and kept going."
1,Not so good,I did not like it. It seemed to drag the story in so many places . It fell short of Patterson's usual good plots and stories
5,a gripper,I've newly discovered Childs writing. Great story line and hard to put the thriller down. I will read more by this author.
2,"Ugh. This is why I don't read fiction, eh?","Well, what can you say?I wish this were a great book for people who are not twisted sickos, but like to read about them. Sort of a Tom Clancy ""Without Remorse"" type of book.Without Remorse 1st (first) edition Text OnlyNope.This book started fast, and then bogged down and never really got going again.Very disappointed, because I had heard good things about the series. I'm willing to try one more."
5,Jack Reacher,"fast paced, story line kept you interested and thinking . !!!! Jack Reacher is not to be taken lightly, qirky at times , Very intelligent. I wouldn't like to get on his bad side,"
3,Starts like a house on fire but peters out before the end,"Entertaining book, but the ending is nowhere as strong as the first chapters. The ending is frankly implausible, and though it is still pretty exciting, it does not match the strong beginning...which has been the pattern with all of the first three Reacher books I have read."
2,Not as good as the first one (The Killing Floor),"very disappointed. The killing floor was much better. Jack Reacher almost seemed like a secondary character in this book. Sometimes there was too much detail and not enough action (like a sniper bullet's course takes about three paragraphs to describe). I'll give number three a try and see if I keep reading or not (hopefully the characters will quit ""shrugging"" constantly)."
4,Tense in a good way,"Jack is smart, strong and surprisingly sensitive in this thriller. One learns about weaponry and combat tactics all the while trying to anticipate the direction of the story. It was fun and satisfying to read."
5,good,Jack Reacher books are always good! Adventuer and good characters as usual. never a dull moment in these books. Fun to read.
4,DIE TRYING,"This book is really good as well. It focuses on how smart Jack Reacher is, he still fights but not as much. I really liked how Jack & friends took out Bo & his group. This book is good to read but I liked The Killing Floor better."
3,Another Reacher Fairy Tale,"I have to agree with another reviewer that called this a fairy tale for men. Reacher takes on powers of nearly mythic proportions in this novel. He can shoot the world's most powerful sniper rifle with an effectiveness never before seen. Every woman loves him and every man respects him. Well all the men that don't want him dead. Yet, even they respect him enough to keep him alive when he is obviously a threat.I don't want to sound too negative. The pacing is good and the dialogue doesn't seem forced or riddled with clichés. Most of the necessary characters are fleshed out in decent manner. There is also a good bit of suspense regarding certain sub plots. Lee Child uses the devices of writing well and comes up with a decent read."
4,So much for a sophomore jinx!,"yes, yes, yes, we know, this book (like the last) starts out with a big coincidence. But it's a coincidence that starts a great story all the way. Child improves with this book and makes you love Reacher more and more with each page. Very recommended series so start reading. Can't put book down!"
4,Advice for those people influenced by the negative reviews!,"As a Lee Child fan I am surprised by some of the negative comments in these reviews. Before you read Die Trying (or any of Lee's books) please be warned : THESE BOOKS ARE FICTION! If you want factual accounts of FBI procedures, read an FBI manual. If you can't handle coincidences in a novel, how the hell do you function when they occur in reality? Die Trying is a thoroughly enjoyable action thriller, a work of FICTION. Jack Reacher is a tough-as-guts, intelligent FICTIONAL character. For the love of Pete, loosen up, people!"
2,Not The Best,"Lee Child is a good writer, a successful one as well.That said, 'Die Trying' was an over-written bore. The desciptive passages are so thick I nearly tripped over them: the weapons, the motivations, the scenery...you name it, Child describes it in detail. Again and again and again.By the time I got towards the end, I lost all empathy for the characters. I just wanted to know how the pliot was resolved.All in all, Child has written more winners than losers. But 'Die Trying' is most certainly in the loser category."
5,Great book - Reacher kicks ass!,Great book - Reacher kicks ass! Downloading and cant wait to read the next book in order! Lee Child also rocks!
3,Rambling Around the Wilderness,"Jack Reacher helps a pretty young woman limping on a crutch with her dry cleaning and ends up kidnapped, along with the woman, by a white supremacist cult.Reacher's a great character and the writing is beautifully detailed, but the plot in this one fails to hang together. The reader ends up running around the woods an awful lot, watching an increasingly difficult to believe series of escapes.Still, Reacher's intelligence and West Point education make him fascinating to follow. It's not a bad book, but it cannot be rated very highly."
3,Villains Seem Almost Quaint Now,"Highly decorated, ex-military policeman Jack Reacher returns in his second outing and instantly finds himself kidnapped with a young FBI agent named Holly Johnson. It turns out she is a desirable target by birth and connection. If you dispel belief that one person can be in two unbelievable situations, you will just sit back and take the ride with Reacher. Given that this was written in 1998, one can remember that at the time breakaway U.S. militia groups were almost omnipresent in the media (and our imaginations). They seem almost quaint now in the era of religious extremism and middle-east uprisings. What I enjoyed about this Reacher novel was the varying viewpoints explored. Overall it dragged a bit but that is balanced with periodic bursts when Child lets loose the action. It is also interesting to find out more about the main character as the series progresses."
3,What's with Jack wearing a watch???,"I just wanted to reread all the Reacher stories and Die Trying was impossible to find in the used pile... I thought it was because everybody was collecting them.. now it turns out, it isn't really Reacher, this guy wears a watch.But he's still pretty tricksie and a gentleman helping a damsel in distress... and the bad guy gets it in classic Lee Child fashion... but really... a watch?"
5,LOVED IT,"if you are an action fan, than you will love lee childs books, ""Jack Reacher"" is a wonderful character......what can i say.im in love!"
3,"OK to read, but a wierd story.","This is an okay novel to read but it has a strange story. Some of the parts are cool but the story is like James Bond meets Bruce Willis. Some parts of the book might confuse you. Like ""who's he?"", ""What happened?"", and What is happening?"" But honestly, I would recommend this book if you hate the government and you want to destroy it. Because that is mostly what you here in this book. Like I said, it has a strang story."
4,A Definitive 'Guy' Book: Shallow and Technical,"I don't read many techno- or militiary thrillers because what makes them sell so well among men is exactly why I find them so dry. They are typically sterile of much emotional interaction, and what little there is, is rather staid and shallow, yet they are rich in technical detail and flourish. Too rich.This book is typical of that genre.But lest that be taken as a criticism, I enjoyed it, for what it was. I didn't find any of it particularly unrealistic, though I DID find the motivations of the malitia group rather simplistically stated. There was much political controversy and conspiracy theory on which Child could have drawn deeply to flesh this portion out.Still, like an episode of the A-Team, this book isn't bad for passing time until something better starts on one of the other channels. I kept this book in the car for reading during long waits in a theater or bank queue, and for that it served its purpose well."
4,Good read,Jack Reacher is Superman. Jack Reacher has nine lives. Jack Reacher shrugs a lot. Everyone in this book shrugs a lot. Almost every page has someone shrugging. I've never seen so much shrugging in a book. I enjoyed the book though and will read more Jack Reacher stories.
5,lee child,"Well written. His character, Jack Reacher is great. I have read all of his Reacher books. I could enter a Reacher trivia contest. Example, he likes his coffee in a relatively thin sided cup. Thick sided ones cool the coffee too much. Reacher is a man's man."
2,"After a dynamite opening novel, Child fails to deliver.","Die Trying never really gets anywhere. The first 1/3 of the book is set up quite well, yet from there the books drift further and further from reality. This whole Montana thing is really quite stupid. The last 100 pages were especially painful. I thought Child's first book, Killing Floor, was truly outstanding. The book was original and extremely well written. Die Trying is a far cry from the quality of Killing Floor. I was not gripping my chair reading Die Trying. In fact, a good judge of a book for me is if I enjoy finishing the book, wish there was more, or find it painful to finish. I found Die Trying painful to finish. I really didn't care what happened b/c the plot was really dumb. Reacher's character is much much weaker in this novel.I will read his next book, but I only hope that he realizes his mistakes from this book."
5,Great book!,"Action,start to finish. Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, something different comes in. Was riveted until the last page. Highly recommended."
4,Bought as a gift,Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it. He is a Jack Reacher fan and was so excited to get to read this.
4,Jack Reacher bring it on.,I found this novel to be above the standard that i have come to expect from Lee Child. This book held my interest from start to finish. The only thing that interupted my enjoyment of this book was my expection and anticipation for the next Jack Reacher book.
4,Die trying,"As an ardent follower of the Jack Reacher novels, this ranks right up there. It makes it even more difficult to envision the runt Tom Cruize as Reacher."
3,"Again, predictable",This book was very predictable. Storylines for Jack Reacher could be spiced up a little more.Pretty hard to believe he just happened to be at the cleaners.Not sure about reading #3Norm
4,suspenceful,The book kept me interested. I was eager to continue reading even after I was sleepy. Took it with me on a trip.
2,Definitely not his best,"The story is slow, filled with descriptions of bullets, how they travel and the impact of each. The story was predictable, so unlike his other cliff-hangers. I would not recommend it unless you are doing a report on bullets and guns."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"This is without doubt the worst novel I have ever read. Why I finished reading the book is beyond me. I had to grit my teeth and go for it. Too bad you have to choose a star rating. Zero should be an option. The events in the book had no realism whatever. Just one of many examples: Beau Borken murders a number of people in Montana. There is absolutely no reaction and no knowledge of anyone that these murders took place. No wife, no relations, no friends. No one cares. There is also no characterization. Every character is exactly the same. Each character speaks the same, right? And the complete stretch engaged in by the author to save Jack Reacher from commitment to a woman (undoubtedly to save him for future use) passes the border of ridiculous. The only benefit I received from this book was knowing that I will never read any books by those authors that supposedly gave the book a good review. My copy of the book is now in the trash where it belongs."
1,Almost Died Trying to Finish,"After one ridiculous, impossible scenario after another, the author finishes by blowing up a truck driving down a freeway of with ""a ton"" of dynamite by shooting the truck from a helicopter with a Barrett. Got that so far? This resulted in:""The terrible energy of the explosion had blasted outward and met absolutely nothing at all in it path. Nothing soft, nothing vulnerable. It had blasted outward and then weakened and slowed and died to a puff of breeze miles away and it had hurt nothing. Nothing at all.""Didn't mess with the highway at all. Why? Because it wasn't soft and vulnerable?Did he remember the ""a ton"" of dynamite part before he wrote these lines? I would prefer to be shot by the Barrett than endure this writing again.I did the terrible act of any book lover and threw this in the garbage can to prevent anyone else from having to endure this ""story."""
1,"Learn the craft of writing, Lee!","Although the story is fairly good, I find it hard to believe there's actually a publisher and/or editor out there who would let such a loose, sloppy style be published. Even in my basic writing classes, I was taught to use the active, not the passive voice. Passive reigns throughout this book. And ""Show, don't tell."" Give me a break! This is one of the ""First Commandments"" of good writing taught in all Writing 101 classes. When only two people are involved in a scene, it's not necessary to continually put, ""he said"" or ""she said"" after ever spoken line. I found it VERY distracting. Child has a long way to go as a good writer. The fact that he's had 3 books published only tells me, not ALL publishers or editors, know their business. Must be a bunch of ""wanna-be's "" who did this one."
4,It's Not Shakespeare,"And it certainly doesn't try to be. What this novel is, like the one before it is a rip roaring good thriller that keeps you entertained right to the final pages. Drifter Jack Reacher is outside a dry cleaning shop helping an attractive young women with her clothes when three men approach with guns and suddenly he and the women are kidnapped. The book is great fun, except one sequence that ratcheted up my fear of tight spaces to a new level. If your looking for thilling escapist reading you've come to the right place."
2,Die Trying... to finish this book!,"I'm female, so maybe this is just a guy's book. I always like a good hero, and Jack Reacher qualifies as such, but I certainly am not interested in paragraphs-long descriptions of the geophysicalities of bullets as they traverse through the atmosphere. This and other testosterone-laden information unfortunately comes well into the book, so I plowed through to the end. I couldn't suspend disbelief in order to believe that any human can discern the difference between 1.4 seconds and 2.1 seconds (as it relates to the time it takes for a bullet to travel). I believe it took me 3.7 seconds to scan through each page to a part that I could tolerate reading until the end of the book, which fell flat."
2,Disappointing and meandering,"Normally a fan of Reacher, this tome just went on way too long. It provided way too much back story, slowing the books down dramatically. I can not recommend it at all."
2,Least favorite,"I started reading the Jack Reacher novels three months ago, and this is the sixth one I've read. The novels make for compulsive, page-turning reading. But the author also has a very good eye, a deft turn of phrase, and an interest in recounting facts which have left me with the impression that I'm reading something better than trash.Most reviewers seem to prefer the early novels in the series, but this is my least favorite so far. The story started well, but quickly became implausible. And, in contrast to the later novels, Mr Childs doesn't seem to bother with factual research, and just makes things up, regardless of whether they're right: this undermined the novel a bit for me.It's still a pretty good read, and I'm enjoying it, but I enjoyed all of the others a lot more."
3,1st-Time Reacher,i am not sure how i feel about Jack after reading two books...tends to be the same thing over and over. This book tended to go on too long with the plot not really going any where and then it was over. It was an ok read
2,Not His Best Effort,"After reading 2 other books in this series, I was eager for more of the same intense suspense that Lee Child creates. Instead this starts with the world's longest car ride. That then gives way to the hero facing the villians and the books spends pages and pages on their ""evil"" diatribe. Ah, come on, Lee. When will this plot start to move? I was about to give up, but I was on the beach, out of reach of whisper net, so I trudged on. And the book improved, only to stumble on a major plot fault on the last pages. One of the bad guys is in the clear. Nobody suspects him. And then for no reason, he grabs a gun and a hostage. Huh? It is a setup for the final denouement of the plot, but the twist is not logical and it was a disappointment compared to the 2 other books I had read (Killing Floor and Worth Dying For, which I do recommend)."
4,Very fun sequel,"I am relatively new to the Jack Reacher world, and this was actually the third Reacher book I have read (I started with ""One Shot"") because it was the one upon which the recent Tom Cruise movie was based before going back to the beginning). As many other reviewers have mentioned, I would start at the beginning before reading this one so that you get a sense of who Jack Reacher is. But once you know that, this book is highly enjoyable. As is Reacher himself, the reader is in the dark about why the events are happening for a long time, but the storyline gradually unfolds very satisfyingly with a terrific foil for Reacher (whom I kept envisioning being played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). If you like Jack Bauer, James Bond, and Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher will be a worthy addition to your heroic nomad pantheon."
1,"Far, far beneath Lee Child's abilities","I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher, and some others; but this was hack serial writing. I had to force myself to keep reading. Teacher becomes nearly super-human in this book, and other characters ""radiate charisma"" that can be felt yards away. The characters are mind-numbingly flat and their motivations and reactions are juvenile. Child does write better later on, but this is definitely a Reached novel worth skipping."
4,Riveting text,Keeps you turning the pages. Can get bogged down in details. I would recommend this author to my friends any time.
3,Something to pass the time,Not the greatest but still it entertains and keeps things interesting through out the whole book. Second Reacher book I've read not as good as the first. The characters are simple with no depth to them. They remaind me of typical characters for a TV action series. I read these when I feel like a little simple action that is fun to read and don't want to think to much. A guilty pleasure I guess. As for the movie I just can't picture Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher but then again it kinda fits the type of shallow character Tom Cruise always plays.
4,Die trying Jack teacher no 2,Good reading very fast pace holds your attention keeps you on the edge of your seat well read more of his books
4,Convoluted and captivating,Reading Die Trying was like riding a roller coaster. Strong characters and unforeseen plot twists kept me enthralled. I couldn't put it down.
3,Shrug,"I have never known so many characters in a story shrug so much, Jack Reacher being the worst. He should be called Jack Shrug. Plot not bad though and some exciting moments"
3,Die Trying,"I found it nowhere near as gripping and as dynamic as others in the ""Reacher""series. My Mother in law is also a ""Reacher"" fan and describes it as ""wishy washy"" and hard to follow."
2,Didn't like it,"The storyline in general was a good idea, however, the characters we're shallowly written and did not reflect the intelligence you would expect for the career's being portrayed. Even though it is quite obvious the main character is basically a drifter, I did not like him just being dumped out in the end like he had no bearing on events that had just taken place."
5,Die Trying - Journey Continues,An excellent follow up to the first book the Killing Floor and continued to explore the person that is Jack Reacher. Was a book that captured my imagination from the first few pages. Found it very hard to put it down.
3,"Solid, not brilliant, but solid","This was a journeyman's book. Coherent and evenly paced. The most interesting thing about these books is the notion of being a person ""Off the Grid"" and how liberating that would be. An fairly pure expression of the Lone Hero -- no possessions, no family, no entanglements no papers. A man who won't be, ""Briefed, debriefed, filed, indexed, stamped or numbered"". ( for those of you old enough to remember The Prisoner ). The flaws in the book are the areas that strain credulity where he is not ever impeded by system. This is a BIG problem in the next book -- I have not been able to finish it for just that reason.However, not to digress, this is a solid book and a good story."
4,Fascinating insight into extremist group,Child has given us a look behind the scenes of how these groups use fear and brain washing to get and keep their followers.
3,Too much filler,I've read 2 other Reacher books in the past so this is not my first time reading a Child/Reacher book. I found myself skimming huge chunks of the book as characters were walking around in the woods. Also found some of the situations preposterous. This hostage that is so important that they went through incredible effort to get to her to the camp is left alone in a room without a guard or a camera and this other massive hulk of a guy who has shown himself skilled enough to escape and kill other members of your team is routinely left under minimal guard so that he can engineer multiple escapes. Wanted to like it more than I did.
4,A fast paced peaked at America's possible future (one of them anyway),"Opens BIG, with the abduction, you are immediately caught up in the frenzy of being ""taken"" and then the hours of cross country travel which could have been an ""are we there yet?"" situation, was filled with the same tension that all of Reacher's adventures bring us."
5,Die trying,"This Jack Reacher book as good as the first. Excellent writing style, sometimes I have to skim through the lines because I can't wait to see what happens. I will be reading the entire series."
5,Intense!,"Lee Child continues to make Jack Reacher the serious hottie detective! Always reluctant, but always honorable, Reacher is constantly righting the wrongs around him!"
2,Boring,"Simply not good enough. Unlike The Killing Floor, this one is slow and boring. Nothing intriguing. No twist at all."
3,Always a great escape from my worries...,Jack Reacher is in the wrong place at the wrong time and finds himself kidnapped along with a woman he's never met. Fast-paced a great to get your mind off of everything else.
2,Boring,"I have read many of Lee Childs books with great expectations to read many more of his books, however If this had been the first book I read of his I probably would not follow up bothering to read any more. I found the plot exciting but then it turned into a BORING spell of describing every arms (Guns) that he came into contact with. Frankly I thought this was far out and really who gives a hoot how fast the bullet leaves the gun, I will say that I have read many of his later books which I would rate 4 or 5 starsBobby G."
3,Good read but just couldn't get past the typos,"I thoroughly enjoy reading the Jack Reacher series but was overwhelmed by the number of typos in the Kindle version. Jack Reacher was referred to as Readier 62 times. Groupings of letters, meant to be words, also littered the book. Punctuation errors also added to the challenge of this read. I usually find a small number of errors in any book I read but this was overwhelming. If this was error-free, I might have given it 5 stars. I hope other Lee Child books don't share this lack of editing."
3,Needed more editing,"Firstly, let me say that I'm reading these books in order, so this was only my 2nd Jack Reacher novel. I loved ""Killing Floor"". It was fast paced & kept me interested from start to finish. But I found ""Die Trying"" a pretty hard slog. I loved the first 100 pages, but after that it just dragged. It could have been 150 pages shorter, and would have been better. Too much detail in relation to firearms, bullets, trajectories, geography & physics. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in those things & know a bit about them from my own career, but I felt like the author just continued to put in detailed paragraphs about those things, which got incredibly repetitive and tedious. I will read the 3rd novel in the series, as I love Jack Reacher & the implausibility of what befalls him. But I hope it's more like ""Killing Floor"" than ""Die Trying""."
3,Reached Me,"Not a bad book. Not usually an Action fan, but found it to be very thrilling but... Too much description of all things, my eyes eventually grazed over all the nitty gritty descriptions of weapons, mathematics to town layout. Can imagine this one in Hollywood."
5,Great book...,"I am now a new fan of author Lee Child and every book I have read to date (about 3) has been excellent. My plan now is to read all of the books that he has written with the main character of Jack Reacher. This book, ""Die Trying"", was no exception -- that is, it is excellent!"
3,"OK, but ..........","An OK book, but not at the level of John Sanford. I got very tired of the author using the word ""right"" at the end of everyone's dialogue. It gets old after a while, right?"
1,How did this book ever get published?,"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. It was a complete waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get better, but to no avail. The hero is something out of a dime novel. Larger than life; knows everything about everything; is smarter than anyone at any level of the CIA, FBI, Armed Forces, etc. In short, it was disgusting. Child would have us believe things that aren't conceivable by any long stretch of the imagination. Perhaps in comic books, things like he describes could happen, but NOT in the real world. I regret that you only go as low as One Star for a rating. I'd have given it a negative. I will also NEVER again, waste my time reading one of Childs stories. Perhaps he should return to scriptwriting. At least we wouldn't have to read his garbage."
4,It's Always Harder the Second Time Around,"Lee Child's second Jack Reacher novel, ""Die Trying"" is a far-fetched but entertaining sequel to his tremendous debut, ""Killing Floor."" The storyline in this one is not as fascinating and intricate as his first adventure. Nonetheless, it has some pretty nasty villains, and some intriguing plot twists and action scenes. This time around, Child decided to use third person for his narrative; that may be what makes this one a little weaker. There was something about seeing everything through Jack's eyes in ""Killing Floor."" This story, however, would not have worked in the first person.Both novels have relied on some pretty far-fetched coincidences to hurl Reacher into the plot, but this is fiction, and the suspension of belief is something required in this type of novel.With all that said, Child still is a writer to reckon with. This book is entertaining and has a satisfying, if somewhat rushed, resolution.Definitely worth reading, though."
3,Reacher falls short,"I have been working my way through the Reacher series and enjoyed them all until this one. Child is excellent at plot and his hero's ability to unravel things through logic is unique. This one falls short in both ways. The plot stops and starts as though Child was puzzle by where to to next. Far less seamless that his others. In addition, far more silly captures and escapes than in the past. No logic just a series of incidents."
1,Doesn't know anything about ballistics,For a book with guns going off constantly - this is elementary. But he knows nothing. Sorry I wasted my time.
3,Die Trying on tape,I haven't opened this book to listen to it so I can't speak to its condition. They should give more time before asking for feedback. It arrived promptly.
1,"read his ""first"" & gave him another chance","a waste of my time------and i won't even waste more of my time letting ""you"" know why."
1,Not good and I otherwise like the series,"Save your money. The story is silly, Reacher's character is undeveloped, the other characters are dull and the violence is gratuitous. I have enjoyed other books in this series, this one should be skipped"
4,Good Guy Stuff,"Much of what I read on my daily commute to work is for entertainment and let's face it, Lee Child entertains with Jack Reacher. Reacher's the larger than life go to guy of fictional characters, the modern cowboy righting wrongs and riding or walking off into the sunset.In DIE TRYING Lee Child gives us a kidnapping of an FBI agent and Reacher who just happens to get caught up in the mix. There's a right, far right militia to contend with, some bad guys in interesting places and enough action to make a daily commute in the rain tolerable.This is the second book in the popular series and the more I read, the more I don't mind my commute so keep writing Mister Child, I'm too young for social security."
4,No two much better t h an the first.,"Great book, a real page tuner. Can not wait to read the next in the series. I am becoming a real fan of Jack."
5,Die trying,Great book from start to finish so much excitement didn't want to stop reading. Will start on book three an hope it's just as good.
3,"Not as good as ""Killing Floor""","I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher book so much, I knew I had to have this book. Unfortunately, this one is not near as interesting and the character development is a bit lacking. I'm not sure I will read anymore in this series after this one."
1,I can't believe people like these books,"I read two of them. I though maybe the first one (which I hated) was an anomaly, after all, so many people like it. Nope, the books suck. Totally unbelievable: characters, settings, and situations."
4,My review of Die Trying,"Really good story, the more I read, the more I wanted to read. I want to read his books in chronological order and have his second book on my iPad. We saw the film and noted Lee Child's cameo appearance as the station sergeant,"
2,Die trying,"Very dry reading , too much tech Info. Seemed like child's was just trying to fill pages.. I enjoyed other teacher books slot more then this one."
4,Die Trying. My second Jack Reacher book,"I read the Killing Floor as my first Jack Reacher book and could not put it down. I immediately downloaded the kindle version of the second book and felt the same. They are fast reads with exciting plots. Looking forward to the third book as soon as I am finished with Frozen Heat, the new Richard Castle book."
5,Jack Reacher series,"From the first book in this series, and now, the second, I love Jack Reacher! He is innovative, intelligent and dynamic. And this writer teaches the reader about ""stuff"" he did not know. Recommend highly!"
5,Great read!,This is a great book and met all of my expectations of a Jack Reacher novel and more. The story was well thought out with twists and turns and the unique moments of jaw-dropping surprise. I highly recommend this book for current Jack Reacher fans and even for those picking up this series for the first time (although you may be a bit lost).
1,Possibly the worst Reacher book,"If you haven't read any Reacher novel yet, don't start with this one. What you have here is not Reacher, not by a long shot, but some colorless and badly drawn prototype -- and the writing is bad too. It's amazing. It's all bad, the entire thing, no matter how you look at it.The later Reacher books are however wonderful. You migth for instance start with 61 hours, which is a hell of a ride, and work your way forward.You might also look at The Enemy for a wonderful first-person narrative."
3,Wasn't What I was Hoping For,"The reader has to suspend belief on too many levels. The armed forces can't scrape together more than 8 guys because it's a holiday weekend, and the kidnapper has them surrender and line up on a bridge; otherwise he's going to shoot the kidnapped girl. Then they just kind of disappear for the rest of the book, unless they were shot while I was asleep - not sure which."
5,Jack Reacher # 2,A great follow up to #1 and it has all the action and great writing as well. I still can't believe that they cast Tom Cruise in this role as he's about a foot shorter than than Jack! Great read and I'm on #4!
4,From good samaritan to militia fighter,Doing a good deed for an attractive FBI agent leads to an encounter with one of the many anti-government groups operating in this country. In typical Jack fashion Reacher establishes himself as a match for any situation in any environment. A good read for Reacher fans-new or old.
3,it was ok,"it was ok, im aware alot of readers love these books but i am not that taken with them. thanks"
4,Jack Reacher is the Clint Eastwood of the '90s,"Although the action begins in the first chapter, there is little familiarity between the reader and the characters. This can cause the first 75 pages to go a bit slowly. However, Child makes up for this in the gradual unfolding of the plot. I must say that I was slightly disappointed with the conclusion, more specifically (w/out giving anything away) - with the way things end up between all the main characters. This was not necessary in order to continue the character of Jack Reacher in future novels. So what if there are a few technical errors in the book. Fiction is just that - FICTION. Enjoyment of the book is clouded by nitpicking over minor discrepencies. I enjoyed this book and must recommend it to all."
1,TERRIBLE,"Let me first say that I never quit on a book once I've started. I've been working on this one for over a month and am only 75% done. It is one of the worst books I have ever purchased. Boring, no real story line -- It's as if it was written in someone's spare time over the course of a weekend."
3,Great for a vacation,This series is an easy read and somewhat addictive. Okay the hero can do things previously limited to people wearing capes but it is just plain old fun. I finished this book in under three days and immediately ordered another in the series.
3,"The usual ""thriller mind candy.""","This is the second in the Jack Reacher series and already the author is following a rather rigid formula to telling his story: disengaged anti-hero, has to fight both the good-guys (police, FBI, etc.) and the bad guys. Most of the time it is difficult to tell who is worse, good or bad guys. The character has a mandatory fleeting afffair with a female character and moves on after he kills the required number of evil doers. But once again it is mildly enjoyable."
4,Great read!,"One of my favorite Jack Teacher novels, so far. Lee Child's makes every word count. He writes suspense on every page."
4,"""Jack Reacher fights a Montana Millitia""","This is the second Jack Reacher Novel, by Lee Child. My Aunt sent me ""One Shot"" which I loved, so I decided to read the Jack Reacher Novels in sequence. I didn't like this as well as ""Killing Floor"" but still found it above average. Liked the Kidnapped Female Agent who is the center of the Novel. But I didn't think the book needed two traitors within the bureau. This book is a fun, thrilling read."
4,Thriller,"This book, the second in the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child, is an excellent adventure story set in the Montana mountains. A vicious cult like leader and his followers plan to provide the ultimate 4th of July fireworks celebration, which would bring this country to its knees. Fortunately, Reacher arrives and attempts to spoil the party. A fun read."
1,c'mon- get real,"Terrible entry in the series. I read Persuader first- really liked it. Then I started with book 1; Thought Killing Floor pushed the limits of all plausibility, but this cartoonish cringe-fest really upped the ante. The villains are so laughable it was impossible to take any part of this silly plot seriously. It was truly amazing to me that they continued to keep Reacher alive no matter how much trouble he caused them (although there was always 5 or 6 rifles leveled at him, aimed at his head). ""How did you disable the shortwave radio?"" Really? How about put a bullet in his head and figure it out yourself????"
5,Die TRying,"I do so like the Reacher stories they ae so not like my run of the mill life. a gentle man who comes to the aid of most ladies. helps out people but ensues they do not take advantage of him, and makes the ones who do him wrong regret into the future or forever"
3,Worth the Read,Fun as a free reader. The author does a nice job of telling a story that makes sense.I enjoyed the book.
4,Pretty darn good!,This is the second Jack Reacher novel I've read and enjoyed it as much as the first. I intend to keep going on this series and hope Lee Child can retain my interest.
1,"Bad premise, bad book - Die Trying","My first acquaintance with Jack Reacher was the movie which I very much enjoyed. I ordered Lee Childs' first book and really liked it. But, regardless of the great action, I'm in the middle of 'Die Trying' and cannot get past the fact that Mr. Childs apparently does not understand that Adolph Hitler did not lead the National Capitalists; they were the National Socialists. It is those GIs who committed their lives to defend the individual freedoms of the Constitution that destroyed the Axis tyrants."
3,It's okay,"As in the first Jack Reacher novel just too many co-incidences, but still a great yarn. . . . ."
4,Grreat Character,Great book but not quite as good as the first one.I would like to see this as a movie
1,So bad it killed my interest in the series,First book wasn't great but I like brain twinkies. The second one was so silly I'm done with this author. If you are going to write about a firearms expert maybe you should do a little research.
3,Fun Read,"The review of Lee Child's books keep saying that the books are getting better. I decided to start the series at the beginning and to work my way through. Die Trying is number 2 and I do not see any improvement. In fact I think that this book is a step back. Others continue to summarize the plot so I will not do repeat the effort.I found in Die Trying several long segments that were boring. The truck ride was never ending and really did not enhance the story. In addition, the sniper scenes were overly technical. Lastly as in many thrillers when the writer begins to discuss politics it is too unbelievable.Putting all that aside, once it is accepted that Jack Reacher is super at all that he does and the reader suspends his knowledge of what is possible the book is very enjoyable.I said in my first review of a Jack Reacher book this is the closest to 24 I have ever experienced in print. I will continue going forward with another installment in a few weeks."
4,Very good escape reading,"Strong characters, excellent dialogue and non-stop, albeit very violent, action combine to make this a fast, entertaining read. I'd categorize this as a perfect airplane book-a great book in which to escape for a few hours, but not one you're likely to collect or reread."
4,"This is a decent book, right?","This was not as good as Killing Floor, right? But it's still a decent read, right? My biggest criticism of Child's books is his abuse of the word ""right"", right? No one I know uses that word at the end of every third sentence, right? Yet EVERYONE in this book does, right? And it's VERY annoying and distracting, right? The plot is far-fetched, Reacher is an Uber-mensch whom anyone would've killed off right from the start, and the main baddie is a cartoon cut-out (why does he have to weigh 400 pounds?) Still, it was a fun, easy read. Mr. Child-PLEASE lose the ""rights"", right?"
2,"A hackneyed, contrived, poorly-written disappointment.","Mr. Child's first crime novel showed promise, though his protagonist conformed to the standard format for such types (and that's all they are): a 20th c. Beowulf out to slay the dragon (evil force) by virtue of his inborn virtue, clever mind, and brute strength. This second in the series reminds me of all of those second rock albums that never should have been produced. But the industry required a sequel, and Mr. Child has come up with the proper word count but not much more. The entire plot premise used here is preposterous and utterly fails to engage the reader's willing suspension of disbelief. This is shopworn, second-rate stuff."
3,"""Killing Floor"" was much superior","Sophomore slump (of sorts) hits another author. Though the book was an enjoyable read, it just didn't grab you like his first. Though I'd recommend it, I'd recommend ""Killing Floor"" much higher -- though this one will pale even more in comparison."
3,Decent book -- a lot of fun.,"Didn't read the first book and spent the first fifty pages or so rolling my eyes at Jack Reacher's invulnerability and/or machismo -- but once you get past that, you actually find yourself rooting for the guy and cheering when he finishes off the villains one by one -- who couldn't root for a hero who uses a lit cigarette and a wooden chair to wipe out a room full of bad guys? Some of the writing is a little dry and the character of Holly seems thin, but overall it's still better than most others in this genre. The descriptions of the technology and military gear can be a bit boring, but overall pretty informative -- Childs obviously did his homework. If you like techno-thrillers with he-men heroes rescuing damsels in distress (okay...a brainy, well-trained damsel but a damsel nonetheless), then you'll enjoy the book."
3,die trying,I enjoy reading the Jack Reacher series but found this one a little to army and a little to political. Great if you have an interest in those topics. Personally i found myself skipping through a lot of pages.For me it was very disappointing.
5,Can't wait to read them all,"How can the novels of Lee Child get any better. His debut rocked and this, his 2nd novel was even better. ""Trip Wire"", Lee's third novel is on it's way, so I'm trying to finish another book before it arrives. I have too many authors to read, and as the saying goes ""Too many books, too little time"", however I will find the time to read all of Lee Child's books. Die Trying keeps you guessing what is next, and when you think you have it, he turns another corner. Jack Reacher is a great hero, a guy you would like to have as a friend, but would not want to cross him. Great, great read!!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","I have been newly acquainted with books like Die Trying. I read Killing Floor first and was hooked. In Die Trying I didn't feel as sucked into the drama as in Mr. Child's first book. I think part of the reason that this book left me feeling different was that it was not written in first person point of view as in Killing Floor. Also, I don't think that there was as much emphasis on the character Jack Reacher as in the previous offering. Still, as you continue to read, you find yourself anticipating what will happen next. I will continue to read Mr. Child's books. I think that he has brought a unique vision to suspense writing and hope that he will continue to entertain readers."
3,still lovin' jack,"While this isn't as good as ""Killing Floor"" I still liked it. The beginning is terrific! It kind of gets bogged down and contrived, but it's still a good romp."
4,Review of book purchase,The book arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Took about two weeks.
4,"good book, good story but a slight back slide from the first.",simple and salient review. just saying.the first book had a very self confident man who was always in control and it was from his perspective. this book has a good story and was well written but the multiple POVs and the bit of a back slide on the character a bit but still a solid book.
4,A bit of a Reach,"Yes, that;s a lame review title but it kind of fits the book. I enjoy Child's writing and his imaginative powers, but he asks a little too much of the reader with this one. I won't say I was ever bored or considered not finishing, because the story is good fun all the way through. It's not great literature but it is pretty good escapism, and sometimes that's more than enough."
4,Enjoyable Story,"Lee Child writes an extremely satisfying story. The hero of the book, Reacher, provides the action needed to make this book a page turner. While not great literature, the story is definitely an enjoyable read. I definitely recommend it."
5,Just try and put this down.......,"As usual, Lee Child did not dissapoint with this Jack Reacher series edition. If you are lucky enough to have Reacher on your side, you're going to prevail. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, will have Reacher defending the rights of the little guy, and Lord help you if you are on the other side. He'll get to the truth, like it or not. Get it, read it, and just try and put this classic down. And as always, the only way to receive the service you have to have, along with the best selection, use Amazon. Only Amazon......."
3,Ho hum no big deal.,"Don't. Know that I would recommend.To anyone . I quit half way through Too much background, discursive info. Just wanted to say, Let us please get on with the plot!"
4,Good Read but Disturbing Images,"This is the first Lee Child book I have read. I saw the movie Jack Reacher and liked the character so I decided to read one of his books. The book was good ... slow in parts ... fast paced in others ... but gruesome and disturbing in others. Although I enjoyed the book, the descriptions of torture, the killings, and twisted minds of others is not something I enjoy reading about so I will probably not read another one of his books. I prefer reading to be relaxing escape from the cruel, evil, and disturbing actions of others, some of the disturbing scenes in this book haunted me. I like suspense and action but not with twisted, gruesome and disturbing evil mixed in."
4,Good read,Enjoy reading the development of the main character. The how's & whys of Jack Reacher as he interacts with the other characters in the story.
2,Not worth picking up again.,"I am trying hard to get into the book, but it hasn't hooked me. I have put it down now for 3 days and am not wondering what happens next. I doubt if I will bother to finish it."
2,Tedious (he shrugged),"I've seen the movie and wanted to read the books. The 2nd book is extremely tedious and the violence is over the top. I can only hope the series gets better and that the author stops with all the shrugs! Every person in the book shrugs all the time, every page. There must be another physical movement other than a shrug the author can use as a response to a situation, statement, etc. Not sure I'm continuing after this book."
4,Die Trying,Die Trying is a Jack Reacher series story that I enjoyed reading. There are some twists and plot changes that surprise you and yet just seem to make the story even more interesting.
1,Awful Product,"Don't even bother wasting your time with this product or any Microtek product. This is the 4th Microtek scanner I have purchased and the 4th I have returned for a refund. The ADF won't feed pages correctly, the scanning bar hesitates and locks up, customer service is absolutely aweful. I waited (on a toll call) for almost an hour and when I finally spoke to someone, they told me it would be a week or so before they cold send me out a new scanner. In the meantime, this was the third scanner of this model I had purchased (I returned one to the on-line merchant and one to my local retailer). All of them had the same problems plus their own unique problems. Don't even do business with Microtek, they don't care."
1,"First scanner was DOA, replacement arrived DOA as well",I ordered the first 5950 scanner from Page Computers. It arrived in two days. I couldn't get it to work after several hours of trying and working with the software setup. Called Tech Support at Microtek & they said the glass was warped on the scan bed & to send it back to retailer. I had to pay for return shipping & requested a replacement scanner. Took one month to process the return & get me a replacement scanner. Replacement scanner had the same problem. Now I'm having to return the replacement as well and pay for more shipping. Sent letter and email to Microtek asking for help and didn't receive any reply.
1,Does not wok with photos,"I purchased this scanner to scan in a large collection of family photo's. The box says ""all in one photo and document scanner for the home and office"". However, in the fine print of the manual is says that the auto loader can't be used for photo's! Also, the auto crop feature did not work. I returned mine."
2,Pricey for what you get,"The Parking Garage by Plan Toys was a present for our older son from his grandmother and at first it seemed like it would be a hit; however, after the first ten minutes he just lost interest and returned to his Play-Doh sets, his trains, Hot Wheels, and Pixar Cars that he is so fond of. Since then he has pretty ignored it. After finding the same product offered on Amazon I was very surprised at the high price, which I would never have paid myself. The Parking Garage is very plain to see, and comes with a plain blue employee, and an even plainer green car (whose tires come off very easily). At least it feels good to the touch as it is all made out of good quality wood without any dangerous chemicals, which is definitely something, but that's pretty much it."
4,Pretty Good toy but came with slight damage,"I just purchased this for my son who is 19 months old. He really likes it but a corner of the garage needed to be glued down. I figured it wasn't worth returning for a slight problem. Just beware that although the photo shows a road at the base of the garage, it doesn't come with the set. I thought it came with the road system and my son could have a track to move his cars around. I found that to be a little deceiving. I just think it is a little pricey for coming with a slight defect and no road system."
2,really bummed,"Just really is basic and doesn't have the addictiveness that plastic versions have. the rampdoesn't cause racing, too big and clunky.."
4,I would buy it again.,"My sons, 3 and 18 mos, have both enjoyed this garage. It was fairly easy to assemble, and has held up better than the plastic one we had originally bought. It has this neat elevator that carries the cars up and down. One note: I was under the impression that several little wooden cars came with the garage, but in fact, only one was included. However, my kids use their other Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars on it without any problem. I'm considering looking into other products from this manufacturer."
1,Disappointed with PLAN,"My friend has a much older model of this garage, and it is great. The elevator moves up and down via a single wooden dowel with a spiral groove, and it is indestructable. The elevator on the version I got is operated by a string and pulley system that quickly broke. In fact, the entire top of the garage comes off. I screwed it back on and used some wood glue, but it is still shoddy. Looks like they have a new design already, but I wouldn't trust it. I bought the orange Plan crane, and it was a piece of junk too. Disappointing."
3,Parking garage,"Despite some of the red edging being splintered as a result of poor quality control rather than damage in shipping (wood used for these is a bit flimsy) the toy was a huge success with my 2 year old. It fits matchbox/hot wheels cars which was a plus.I wanted to replace the damaged part, but have been unable to do this without returning the whole item, which seems like a ridiculous waste of resources."
3,"Well Made...but, pricey","We were looking for a garage for our large collection of toy cars. This is a well made, sturdy product with a little car wash and an elevator. It even comes with one vehicle. Strangely, the kids didn't really use it. It is pretty pricey and didn't get much use. If you know your child will use it and enjoy it, then worth the investment for the quality. However, it just wasn't a hit for us."
2,Not durable,"I like the Play Toy company and many of their products, but many of their products are not durable. The part that rolls the elevator up and down bends easily and has stopped working on ours. Also I don't like that the gas station pumps are not very accessible."
4,good quality!,"good toy, very sturdy and solid, my only problem is the 2 gas pump at the base of the toy can't be accessed even by the little ones limiting the imaginative play.Plan Toys City Series Parking Garage"
5,Best gift ever for my 2 year old,"I purchased this for my 2.75 year old for Christmas, and now at the end of February, it is still in the middle of the living room and has had multiple HOURS of play every single day since then for two solid months now. He ADORES this thing. It is extremely solidly built, his match box cars fit on it, he can do the elevator by himself, and he just loves it. I can't rave enough about this toy. I purchased a wooden train set that was his other gift at Christmas, and it has gotten hardly any play compared to this garage."
5,very entertaining!,"We bought this garage for our son's third birthday. It is much more durable than the new plastic models, and he plays with it for an hour at a time. The car that comes with it is nice with rubber wheels, but hot wheels and matchbox cars work well, too. His 8-year-old brother even enjoys playing with this garage. I would definitely recommend--good quality, which I would expect for the price."
3,Well made beautiful looking toy but gets old after awhile,We've had this parking garage for two years now and it has held up well except the elevator is broken. I think we could unscrew it and fix it somehow maybe. It so good-looking and nice that it's wooden but it does get boring after awhile. The small plan city cars are adorable too but my younger son bit the wheels off so I had to take them away. My boys have gotten way more use out of the train tracks or Legos because of the creativity involved. So nice toy but it is expensive for the use we got out of it.
3,Good but a bit misleading in description,"I like plan toys products- usually good quality, simple, wooden toys.In this one, the package makes it look like all the accessories are included. Once I opened the box I was surprised that there weren't any cars or the helicopter or street signs included. I ordered the set of 3 cars and transporter seperately afterwards.It took me about 25 min to put together and I was disappointed that it didnt come with more cars for the price.My only other complaint is that the ""gas station"" part is so far under the 1st garage level (its the base for the garage above it) that it is hard for little hands to get the cars in to the gas station part. The car wash is just a free standing little thing whereas other garages its really like a tunnel or a real car wash. I think the garage/ramp part and elevator are good but I don't think the gas station/car wash are very easy/fun to use."
1,Version 6.0 UNUSABLE.,"A number of first releases of this version were shipped without CD Keys--or so I was informed by tech support after being sent from from one defunct customer service number to another. Tech support told me that my Key-less product was unusable, but that they were not authorized to issue a new number.I called customer service, but was put on hold until after they stopped taking calls (5:00PM).I called back the following day, but again was left on hold for 30 minutes, before giving up."
4,Read Special offer,"Make sure you go to the ""Special Offers"" page. It turns outyou are only eligible for the offer if you already own NAV ora competitor's product. If you're a new user you're payingfull price."
1,Maybe I got a defective one,"After hours and hours of reading to it, training it to recognize our voices, we couldn't get HALF a correct sentence. ""Good morning, dear,"" became Invade tree apple clear."
2,Very buggy; works once you get it going.,"I was very disappointed with the software product. Although the speech recognition capability was excellent, the program is wrought with bugs and is difficult to get started. In less you are using this application to work with Microsoft Word, you may have a difficult time.I was especially disappointed to find out how long it takes to get started once you actually start to software. For example, when you click the mike on, sometimes it would be almost a full minute before the program would start to understand your speech. Sometimes I had to turn the microphone off and on a couple of times.The software fascinates me and does impress me to a certain degree. It is truly amazing technology. However, there is much to be desired in terms of usability. I paid a lot of money for this software, and I expect it to conform to a certain standard.I am going to try IBM ViaVoice."
1,Worthless,"If you want to get out of debt and make a million bucks, write a book on how to get out of debt and make a million bucks. This stinks. Dave Ramsey is the only way to go folks."
3,Interesting,"This book offered many interesting tips. Although I didn't agree with some of them, I think the author did a nice job."
5,"Well-crafted, well-composed and well-intentioned","Borges' work is stunning to behold, but if you can't make it to a gallery showing of his work, this nicely laid out book is the next best thing. His original technique of selective sepia toning, applied only to the flesh, beautifully complements his compositional style of pulling his subjects clearly out in front of their surroundings. The final effect is to concentrate the viewer's attention onto the person as an individual -- the often-exotic setting provides context and a deeper understanding, but does not distract. The dignity of Borges' subjects shines through, and the fact that this work is connected with Amnesty International is an added bonus."
5,Stunning Portraits of Humanity,I picked this up after seeing an exhibit of Borges work at a gallery in San Diego. The images in this book capture the essence of his work in that they express the dignity of people in various cultural and geographic settings simply and beautifully . Wonderful Book to return to again and again. Very uplifting.
1,Crappy Cable,"Tried to give this cable a fair shake, but WOW it struck out. Originally purchased 2 cables for my multi-monitor setup. Both were faulty. They did not transfer monitor product info to the PC. I had everything set up and had to trouble shoot everything to isolate the issue, and the end result was faulty cables. Sent them back ordered a different cable from a different supplier, and to be fair ordered 1 new cable from this supplier hoping I had just gotten 2 bad cables. NOPE 3rd cable struck out as well, so back it went. Out of 3 cables, all 3 were faulty. Do not buy these particular cables, hopefully this supplier junks their inventory of this cable and replaces their inventory with a cable from different manufacturer."
1,Stacked deck,"This is agreat game if you like playing against a stacked deck. Most of the reviews I've seen talk about installation and run issues, but I've played these games a lot and have gotten to the point where I can call the game before it starts.I mostly play the Cribbage and the Gin. Play the Cribbage. Your opponent will get 3 to 4 fives for each of yours, and will get at least one or two absolutely killer cuts. He will also almost always have a hand that he can play directly into yours - if you have a nine, he always has a six. I've played Cribbage for 40 years and maybe have seen 1 or 2 24 point hands. Expect your opponent to get one per game.The Gin is almost as bad. My advise - don't win. If you think you got garbage hands before, after you win it get even worse."
5,Best version,"I reviewed this version for GamePen oh so long ago, and this is the best of the Hoyle Card Games, when it was still being published by Sierra. The best non-advertised feature are the arcade solitaire games - those games you find in bars like Run 21 and Tri-Castle. They're nifty addictions which you don't have to spend quarters on.It's a real shame, though, that the online multiplayer no longer functions (you're directed to a defunct site)."
3,Contrived,"Unfortuneately I have to agree with some of the people who feel the game is to contrived. Once you get to the higher levels of the game, there is no strategy or randomness, as in real life.Ex. EuchreYou can get to a certain point in percentage won, then the game slaps you backward 2%, at least. I find it difficult to believe anyone would be given almost exclusively, 9's and 10's, for several games. Games, not hands, in a game.Even the characters are yawning.On a positive note, and the only reason I gave it three stars, it's good for learning different games on.I must add I am generally unhappy with Sierra software. Perhaps Hoyle would consider giving it's license to someone else !"
3,pino,in pino your make bid should be 200 points not 20 pointsand bider goes out. I would like an up date as soon as u fix them
1,awkward piece of junk,this is nowhere near as well designed as products that you can get for $5 - $10 dollars in the bargin bin. don't waste your time with this.
1,Mislabelled Specs for Hoyle Card Games 5 (2002),"I purchased this game with a labelled carton saying it was for ""Windows 95/98/2000/Me/XP"". After installation, I could not activate any sound effects, using a Windows 2000 operating system. Now the phone support states that it is not designed for 2000, and this operating software is no longer sisted on your website for the program. It is going back to Costco, and I shall find another source of card game software. Very disappointed."
2,Not for mac os x,This program has to run in classic mode which is annoying and the picture quality is awful. I also don't like the characters and backgrounds - I prefer the boring drabness of my old ms windows game but haven't found anything like it for macs yet.
1,Poor Excuse for Bridge,"This software offers an ""expert"" option to play Bridge. After playing it many times, I have come to the conclusion that the person who coded this game has no idea how to play it. The computer players almost never reach game and they often throw trump when they shouldn't. They will discard cards that are sure tricks for them. Also, the claim option doesn't work very well. You can't claim yourself, the computer will do it for you but not all the time. Very aggravating. I can only speak for Bridge and not the other games on this cd."
5,PERFECT!!!,The bags got her VERY quickly and they were exactly as described. I am totally happy!!!!! I will definitely buy them here next time.
1,Bag don't fit the newer Kirby as stated,We finally needed to replace a bag today and learned that these don't fit! They need to be cut to fit the Sentria model. This is not what was promised.
1,disappointed,the bags don't seal. I have to clean out so much of the debris I vacuumed up that is outside of the vacuum bag. Will not buy again.
5,Kirby Allergen Filtration Bags,"Coming from a Kirby user with bad allergies, I decided to get this non-Kirby brand. It works as good as the Kirby one.I don't sneeze or get the allergy symptoms when I vacuum.Great product and better with the price here in Amazon compared to the local Kirby distribution shops."
1,Horrible!,Horrible! Does not fit the Sentria like the description states. Looked like it would work but ended up with a huge mess inside the bag! Thought I'd try it again and again the bag came off of the hose. I had to resort to duct taping it just for it to work until we get new ones. Do not waste your money! If you have a Sentria do not purchase these! You will have a huge mess on your hands!
1,NOT FOR SENTRIA MODLE!!,Was disappointed that this product when I ordered it said it fits ALL Kirby uprights. These bags DO NOT fit the Sentria model at all. That will teach me to try and save money on generic brands. Frustrated by the false advertising. Now that I need the vacuum bags I still don't have any...
1,These bags do not fit the Kirby G6 properly.,These bags do not fit the Kirby G6 properly. These are generic bags and are not equivalent to the manufacturer replacement. I had to return them.
4,okay,wish i boutght the real thing. These are definately vacuum cleaner bags. I just love vacuuming. no I will not vacuum your house.
1,not a kirby,"This product looks like a kirby, but does not have the quality of a kirby. It is quite generic, i am hoping that it will hold the dirt, but i am afraid to try."
5,Love these bags!,These bags work as well as the Kirby brand and are more affordable! I have never had any problems with them.
2,Not a truthful discription,"It says for sentria, i was skeptical because i bought some bags for a generation from walmart and they did not really fit the sentria. I trusted this discription assuming they must know what they're talking about, but no they r the same that i bought from the store. I can get by with them, but they do not actually make these bags for the senteia."
3,Vac bags.,Says it is for the Generation 3; which I have but it does not have the proper notch; still fits but have not used it enough to see if it pops off; this is my back up vac; I have the Sentria for my main vac.
4,Good vacuum bags. Good fit.,"Obviously cheaper made than the originals, but since I'm putting dirt and hair in them, whatever ;)Good fit onto my vacuum. Good bags."
5,Vacuum bags,"Great product to replace the namebrand Kirby bags. I have been using these bags since I bought my Kirby two years ago. I have never had a bag rip, tear, or not fit properly. These are a great bag for the price."
5,Good Price,"I order this brand of Kirby generation bags. They are the brown paper kind, they work great with my g6. Very Happy!"
5,Cheap and Good,"These bags are as good as the original Kirby bags, but cheaper. Plus, they last a long time since you get more than 20 bags at a really good cheap price. Overall, you can't get any better bags for a Kirby at this price!!"
3,Vacuum cleaner bags,"The vacuum cleaner bags don't seem as thick as the real Kirby brand, other than that they are working fine."
4,A brave and resourceful group of women,"""The Women Who Wrote the War"" is a comprehensive compilation and listing of the contribution of women in the press in World War II. From the first women to recognize the changes in Germany, the real threat of Hitler, and to sound the call of the rise of fanaticism, these women had to fight against fear, physical threats and censorship. They also had to work their way around the bias against their sex....often entering dangerous areas with no support or credentials. All arenas of the war were covered by women, from Germany, France and Britian, to the camps in the Far East and Russia. These women were invaluable in providing an acounting of the horrors of war and the human toll it took. They report on all fronts,and unflinchingly look at he horrors of war close up. This book also details the struggle of these women to be accepted, to find their place in a male dominated career. ""The Women Who Wrote the War"" is a fiting tribute to there trailblazers."
3,Not the easiest to use,Needed something better than a sling to immobilize my right shoulder. The product is cheap enough but it's a case of you get what you pay for. The product is hard to put on by the person who needs to use it especially if they have limited use of one arm. Also it is hard to adjust and so far I have not been able to get it to immobilize my shoulder any better than a regular sling can do. Also because of positioning of wrist support this can lead to wrist pain as forearm is not completely supported like a sling. I would not purchase this product again.
2,Not so good for dislocated shoulder,"This immobilizer works fine once you get it on, but it is bulky, difficult to adjust, and difficult to put on out of the box. The elastic type of immobilizer is better because you can usually get it on yourself and its ten times more comfortable. Presumably, you are looking at this as an upgrade from the one they gave you at the hospital and I am telling you this is a purchase you will most likely regret. It has the proper design elements to immobilize your shoulder better than a standard arm sling, but those elements are so poorly put together that you are better off without it."
5,Very good for the price,"I am currently wearing this product as I am writing this review. It is made in the USA, which is a plus, in my opinion. It is very lightweight but it does the job, well enough. It is padded and covered with what feels like fleece and is held together with velcro straps. I found it easy to put on and take off, however, I found the shoulder strap to be less than useless so I keep it wrapped around my waist and clipped to the hand rest instead of over my shoulder. The waistband works well enough by itself to hold my arm close to my body. I have found it useful to also use the velcro tape that holds on the hand rest to further keep the waistband from coming apart. The waistband has a tendency to stretch a bit and ride up, but it is very easy to readjust. They should probably include info on the maximum waist and arm size this will fit, as a hefty person might have a problem with it being too small, but for me it is a good fit."
3,Designed for medium to small person,"I had a recent shoulder surgery and was looking for a brace which could do what this brace does: immobilize the upper arm and release the lower arm. (For piano practice.) Unfortunately, I have a 50 inch chest and this strap failed to reach around my chest by about 6-8 inches. The harness appeared otherwise adequate in construction but a bit difficult to assemble and apply one handed."
2,No shipping skills apparently required,"By sheer luck the product is fine, despite the mind-bogglingly awful packaging used to ship it. The thin cardboard box with the product in it was stuffed in an envelope. Needless to say that it was crushed almost beyond recognition by the time it arrived. Fortunately for me it wasn't broken. I cannot fathom how anyone could have thought that it was proper, professional packaging. The product itself is the most important thing, and it worked as advertised."
1,don't get this if you're a small person,"nobody likes slings or braces so i thought i'd try this one in spite of mixed reviews. i'm 5'3"",112 lbs, 46 years old. my horse bucked me off, broke my collar bone. the picture of this shoulder immobilizer looked comfortable, but i took it off after about six hours. it's super hot-not in a good way-bulky, and won't get cinched up good enough on a small person. maybe i'll try it again in a week or two, but for now... :-("
4,works well,bought for our son. he says it's comfortable. he can put it on and take it off without any help. does what it's supposed to.
3,Not Big enough,"Pros: This item works quite well. It allows access to your arm. You can use it under a coat with little problem. Just keep the hand holder outside.Cons: For big people, the waist strap is too short. In order to keep it up, I have to use the velcro thats for the hand sling to keep the belt closed. The connections for the shoulder strap could be a little more secure. It tends to disconnect too readily."
2,"Better than the worst, but not by much","While this is a step up from the immobilizers given by hospitals/surgery centers, it is still a questionable support. The one shoulder strap may prevent the device from slipping down on the torso, but the elbow strap will not fit all patients. For example, a shorter patient with larger breasts may find that the elbow strap will not add any additional stability, therefore rendering the device virtually worthless. Additionally, while the device prevents abduction it may also add undo distress to the healing joint as movement in the upper torso is not inhibited, causing each minor movement to jar against the device without any ""give."" If you are needing an immobilizer for 6 or more weeks, I would NEVER recommend this product. Look for a sling / sheath combination instead. And I hate to say it, but you may still need a friend to give you a hand no matter what device you're using. So, be nice."
3,"Probably good if you have a friend to help, but alone, too hard to put on","The title says it all. There are like four or five pieces to this, and with a shoulder injury, it's way too hard to put together and wear to be useful. A simple sling would be better for me. If I had a live-in nurse (aka wife), it would probably be fine, but I live alone and it's a PITA. Good stabilization though if used properly."
2,Small sizes only,"I was disappointed to find most women's patterns are for a size range (XS-S, S-M) with no larger sizes. I put it back on the shelf."
2,"Nothing ""Uncommon"" here...","After looking through this book, I became very disapointed. I was really looking forward to it's release, but after looking at all the patterns I found nothing new, exciting, sexy or uncommon. The first few patterns in the book are so fuddy-duddy I couldn't believe it. The obi pattern on the cover is likely the coolest pattern, but any knitter with a little experience could make this without a pattern. There is one other sweater that has a little style, but over all it is simply old hat. The description from the main book page is misleading. If you want fun patterns that have style there are many better books out there."
1,Disappointing,"I'm an avid knitter, and own almost every knitting book published. I have never been as disappointed with a knitting book as I have with this one. The patterns are either out-of-date or not suited for anyone under 50 (there are two patterns--a tube top and a halter top--that are so poorly designed that only prepubescent girls without chests could wear them). Save your money."
2,Leave after dark in the dark!,"WEll I was so looking forward to the book when I saw it was to be released. The title and cover evoked a sense of sexiness, something to be enjoyed for the young and modern working professional. I thought it would be fun to knit some projects to wear after hours downtown. But I was hugely disappointed. There is just nothing fresh, or sexy, or even uncommon. It just seems out of date. Though my grandmother enjoyed looking at the book. But lesson learned, never buy without browsing through first, even if you have loved everything else by the designer in the past."
1,Grannys Only!,"Oh my! I'm so glad I got this book on Amazon's Marketplace for $1.49 and didn't pay retail. If you're looking for knits for evening wear and you're under 70, skip this.Every women's pattern in here is odd looking and boxy and are things only an elderly woman can pull off. She harps on and on about NYC, etc. I'm sorry, I'm a Native NYer and I don't know any self respecting woman with even the smallest interest in fashion that would wear something in this book. Maybe the 90 year old grannies that only leave the house to go to charity events and are about 2 steps short of wearing their braziers on the outside of their clothing?Some of the children's patterns are cute, but again, uninspired.I would give my book away, but no one wants it. I'm VERY disappointed because I've heard such great things about Jil Eaton's children's patterns... I think maybe she should stick to designing for kids."
5,Great cable at a low price.,"The cables are excellent quality, as they are well insulated and have ferrite cores to prevent electrical interference. I have this cable connected to a monitor from a splitter and the cable is still able to transmit a 1080P signal to it. The review about the pins makes no sense and the review about the ""fat"" cable issue is actually a plus."
4,Hot flashes,Hot flashes improving durring the day. sometimes still have one in eve. increasing dose to 3 a day now. ope that helps the eve ones.
2,Didn't work for me,"I had to have a complete hysterectomy with both ovaries removed in February. Hot flashes started coming in April, and they have been numerous and were keeping me awake all night. I took the whole bottle,3 per day, hoping it would help, but unfortunately, it didn't help in the least. It obviously works for some, but not for me. I have just been taking benadryl to sleep at nights, in case that would be an idea for anyone else."
5,beautiful book,"I have wanted this book for a few years, since seeing a friends copy. It is as stunning as I remember. Beautiful to read on a gray day."
5,Excellent For A Early Childhood Teaching Literacy Methods Class,"I often find trouble locating a book centered on EQUALLY helping early childhood teachers and elementary teachers give reading instruction ot children who approach it with difficulty. Mostly the books I find overwhelmingly focus on elementary-aged children while leaving the First, Second, and Third Graders a little out of the limelight.This book (now in its 3rd and best-yet edition) remedies that vacancy by offering a balanced approach to teaching reading that will work for struggling as well as advanced readers through MOSTLY (not all) developmentally appropriate methods.Chapters 3-5 (on preparing the reader to read) will change the way you view your instruction."
5,Effective Reading Strategies,"Great book! Wonderful Appendix resources including Award-Winning books, Common Word Families, Children's magazines, internet sites, and sight word lists. A must for any reading teacher."
2,Novel good; disc defective,"Dick Francis's ""Second Wind"" was a good ""listen"" (on disc) but one of the discs was defective, so I could not hear several minutes' worth of the story. The disc froze at a certain point and could not be advanced."
1,big disappoinment,"This book was recommended to me by a longtime Dick Francis fan. I, too, am a Dick Francis fan but this book is a huge dasappointment. It's been several years since I've read Francis but this isn't the writing style I remember. Sentences ramble on; I found myself rereading sentences hoping they would make more sense the second time around. One reviewer wondered if this was ghost written. The same thought crossed my mind. If you really enjoy Dick Fracis as I do, don't read this book. Remember him at his finest."
1,I thought something was wrong with me!,"I had a cold while I was reading this book and I thought it was me. I usually love Dick Francis, but I was so confused. The plot did not make any sense and the dialog was terrible. I had to make myself keep reading the book. I hope the next is better."
2,Confusion,"I find myself still confused with what seem events lacking credibility. Also, the characters just didn't come to life. I'm sure the technical details were researched, but I was just left with the feeling that the main character just wasn't that fired up with his occupation.Although my experience is dated, I am a little familiar with flying and with the size of the ocean... Is the story really possible?Perhaps my problem is that I haad just re-read ""Hot Money"" and enjoyed the reunion with the real characters in that book."
1,A Terrible Book - Read Something Else,"I read this because ""I love Dick Francis novels"" but this one was just terrible. I finished it only out of mild curiousity of the outcome. He has written so many wonderful books - read those, and skip this one."
2,Dick Francis mailed this one in.,"As is the case with so many popular well-established authors, Mr. Francis seems to have run out of steam on this book. The formula is there, but there is almost no suspense and the characters are devoid of personality. There is very little here to hold one's interest. The author has painted his characters with broad, shallow brush strokes rather than the deep, rich tones we have come to expect. I suspect that he has become a victim of his own prodigious output, and simply put words together to satisfy his publisher's demands."
4,Slow start - fast finish,"Mr. Francis is amazing in his knowledge of diverse subjects and this book really proves that point. Although it starts off rather ""wobbily"" when he does get going it's a different kind of plot entirely for Francis and for most of the other mysteries out there. He is saddly lacking in his handling of romance, but then we don't read Francis for romance. Not nearly as good as ""To the Hilt"" but better than several others of his."
2,"Maybe good for some, but a bust for Mr. Francis!","Was this whole book just an afterthought? Dick Francis has been my favorite author for decades, but he is losing the touches that drew me to him. This book might be great for anyone else, but a bust for Mr. Francis.Horses only appeared as something to be abused and to suffer at the hands of men. Racecourses only appeared because everyone has to be somewhere. Oh, yeah, let's stick in a girl for the romance part of the formula.And the villains! Totally unbelievable! And the source of the conflict, the goings-on on Trox, totally unbelievable!However, Mr. Francis never fails to deliver on interesting details, and I learned something, as I always do. And he certainly never fails to deliver exquisite verbiage, and unique opening and ending lines.Go back and read Nerve, Enquiry, Longshot or Reflex to get a true shot of Mr. Francis' enormous talent."
2,Ghostwritten?,"I agree with some of the other reviewers here, that this book has a very different, more scattered, voice than his others, and may possibly have been ghostwritten. There is reference in the book to ghostwriting, which doesn't fit in with the plot, so that may be a clue. Also, the horses/racing were much less prevalent.Twice the word ""than"" is misspelled as ""then."" He never misspells in his other books. Of course, perhaps this one had a different editor, who didn't catch it.Overall, it is an OK story, but I do wonder if he wrote it. Why would a successful author risk his reputation with a ghostwriter though? It's a mystery."
4,"Another good Francis book, but different!","I have read every book written by Dick Francis, and having a close connection with the horseracing field, have always enjoyed his books. The twists and turns and well written mysteries are always in ""Francis style"", but he has managed to create differences in each of his books.I found Second Wind very good. I was pleased with the plot of the book, the variation of locations and the twists in the end.However, this book confused me with its general composition and written format. The story was Francis, but the writing style was not. Sentences going on forever and weaving on through entire paragraphs. I really wonder if a ""ghost writer"" had helped him put this story down on paper. It just didn't seem right.Dick Francis has been a consistently fabulous writer for many years and I recommend this book to his fans.I hope the death of his beloved wife this past year does not conclude his literary gifts to the world.....a fan"
1,Give this one a miss!,"I've always enjoyed reading Dick Francis and I have read most of his books. This time he moves away from the field of horse racing and the result is a failure. I can think of nothing good to say about this book. The plot is weak and not even remotely plausible. I think if the script did not have the Dick Francis name, the book would never have been published."
2,Not his best by any means,I think this has been the only Dick Francis novel I've not read at a single sitting. The writing was as good as ever but the plot simply wasn't as gripping as in his earlier works.
1,A disappointment from a favorite author!,"My reaction to this book is that his editor forgot to do his/her job. Awkward, rambling sentences, poor characterizations and far-fetched plot make this a disappointment from page one. This book is not in the same league with any of his other novels. Pass on this one."
1,Disappointment,Second Wind is a disappointing book; it could not hold my interest at all. The characters lacked the normal charm I look for in Francis' books. I found both the hero and the plot uninteresting. This was a major letdown from one of my favorite authors.
4,More great rational heroes...,"The primary reason I continue to seek out and read Dick Francis is that he continually creates heroes that are efficacious and rational. He avoids the common pitfalls of most modern writers, and instead invents characters who pass the ultimate test: ""Would I like to meet and know this person?"" If you can answer ""yes"" to that question then there is great potential for enjoyment in the fiction centered around that character. If you answer ""no"" to that question, why even bother reading further?In Second Wind the master of galloping fiction spins an interesting story with more twists than a hurricane. Although it is not my favorite Francis book it is certainly worthy of my growing library of top books recommended to friends."
2,Save your money -- skip this one,"I'm another long-time Dick Francis fan who was greatly disappointed in this book. Second Wind is tired, formulaic, unbelievable and -- I never thought I'd say this about a Dick Francis book -- BORING! Go back and re-read any of his early books (Flying Finish is an interesting contrast, since it also involves high-tension flying scenes.) Come on, Mr. Francis, we expect better than this from you!"
1,Second Wind,"Did Mr. Francis get a new editor? Did Mr. Francis really write this book? Usually the author writes with an ease of dialogue, illustrating his characters for the reader and delivering perfect timing. The relationship with Jett was clumsy and a bit of a surprise. I'm sure the weather information was accurate because Francis ususally does good research, but he's better at writing mysteries and adventure with real horse plots, not just throw in a horse because his name is associated with that style. Very disappointing. Did he really write this one?"
1,So disappointing!,"I have read Dick Fancis novels for 15 years and this is the first one my husband ever had to hear me complain about. I found much of the writing convoluted and overblown and often times the end of the sentences didn't match up with how they had started. Add to that characters who never really take hold (I felt like I should have a score card: Robin Darcy, round, bald, married to Evelyn, lives in Florida, mushroom and sod king)and plot lines that are confusing at best and this adds up to a real disappointment. I usually save Dick Francis novels for long plane trips as they make the time fly! If I had taken this on the plane, I would have thought I was traveling by old fashioned stage coach. Better luck next time, Mr. Francis!"
3,"Believable hero, weak plot","Though very readable, the plot, supporting character, and villains, are weak and not believable. This is the first one of his books that I've had to go back a few pages every so often to try to make sense of the character's actions. If Mr. Francis had centered the plot around horses and kept the hurricane & meteorology, this would have been a great, classic ""Dick Francis."" I'll pass the book on and hope for a return to the straight horse stories."
3,Not quite up to his usual standard,"Most of Dick Francis' books are fast-paced, gripping stories that teach you a little about a career, as well as entertain. In this book, however, he seems to have problems coming up with something exciting for a weatherman to do. Rather than change the setting from England to somewhere with more dramatic weather, he sends the hero on a trip to Florida for a hurricane, then returns him immediately to England after the token weather event. There isn't even a good villain to focus on, and the only time the hero is in danger is when he deliberately goes out of his way to provoke someone for no good reason. All in all, I was disappointed."
1,Dick Please forgive me.,"Mr. Francis has done nothing but entertain me for years and years, you can't miss with a Dick Francis book, hmmm except maybe this one, if you want to know dick francis look elsewhere, but one clinker in so so many, i still will read every word you write. (Still did you really write this?)"
2,A Flop for a normally Fantastic Author,"Francis is an all-time great mystery writer. His fascinating stories revolve around horse racing and another subject- always educating the reader on the subject of that particular book. Usually I describe his stories as riveting and intoxicating. I'd rather be reading one of his books than doing anything else! I'm afraid this book was the complete opposite of his others. I had to force myself to finish and at the end had to re-check the cover to make sure this was indeed a Dick Francis novel. I'm not giving up...I'm sure his next book won't be a flop!(If you haven't read The Danger, To the Hilt, or Hot Money...all are superb.)"
3,Not impressive.........,"When my English Lit teacher suggested Dick Francis as a good mystery writer i expected an action packed, page-turning thriller. Well.... that's far from what I actually got. It was boring and quite confusing. The only reason this book got three stars was that a good plot line occasionally peeked through the otherwise drunkeness of the book."
3,A disappointment for Dick Francis fans.,"As an old Dick Francis fan, I was disappointed in this one. The plot was thin and obviously contrived to support a novel idea (flying through a hurricane). Definitely not up to his usual standards."
3,Nice quick read,"Having never read Francis before, I liked this book. It's fast paced, has interesting and unexpected twists, and is very entertaining."
5,Fabulous Francis,"From hurricanes to horseracing, I could hardly put this book down. The main character was more loveable than Francis' usual heroes. He cared a little more, showed a little more of his soft side, and loved a little more. One of Francis' quick-witted heroes strikes again! Loved it!"
1,Give this one a miss,"I've been a Dick Francis fan for a long time, marveling at his ability to turn out a great read year after year. But this is one of the relatively few duds in the Francis canon. The villains are incompetent and silly; the plot has enormous holes. Perhaps most disappointing is that Francis' usual knack for developing psychologically true and interesting characters is absent. Do yourself a favor: Pass on this one and reread one of your favorites from his earlier works."
1,Unexpectedly Terrible,"I love Dick Francis books; this is the only one I have read that was really awful. It held none of the charm of his other works, and was confusing to boot. My wife was equally astonished."
2,Second Wind,"I was disappointed also. I like the horseracing backdrop. Having the weather as the main backdrop was ok and thank goodness I watch the weather channel. I didn't understand or see it explained why the horse was feed the radioactive material. I don't feel Robin was the up to up kinda guy he made him out to be in the end. Also, what was it with the trains and the friend. too many loose ends for me. I would like to see him be challenged and write a sleuthing couple. He a retired jock and she a trainer or vet, etc. Or do another Sid."
2,"Francis disappoints, for one of the few times, in this effor","Second Choice is one of the few time Francis disppoints. When he moves away from horses, he moves aways from the environment he knows best which forces him to focus on the technical information that he has learned which he wants to us as a background for his new novel. In Second Wind, he has studied hurricanes. He tries to create a story in which he can use his new found knowledge. We learn a lot about hurricanes, flying into hurricanes, and tracking hurricanes, but the story he attempts to create with hurricanes as a backdrop never seems creditable. These aren't the usual believable Francis characters, nor a tightly woven plot. The background became the foreground. Even the ending seems forced; i.e., how do I bring this thing to a conclusion."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have to agree with most of the others. Did Dick Francis actually write this book? If so, what happened? I kept reading in hopes that the uninteresting, convoluted plot would get better if I just gave it a few more pages. It never did. Don't waste your time with this one. Go get one of your old Dick Francis favorites and re-read it instead."
3,Disappointing,"I have all Mr Francis' production on my shelves, and each one of his books has been for me continuous reading to its end. This happened with this new novel, too, but this time it was just out of deference for past merits. Mr Francis has apparently come short of ideas for the plots of his books, and has made in this one a partial change of scenario: meteorology, hurricanes, shady deals on the market of fixionable material. His classical grounds (the turf, National Hunt, steeplechasing, point-to-point, etc.), where he used to couple an undoubtable ability to write with an intimate knowledge of that world, are marginal here. And the spinning of the story, the writer's way of telling it, is somewhat circumvoluted. Regrettable: I preferred the old form. Nevertheless, it is for sure I will keep snapping up any of Mr Francis's books to come (and I do hope they will keep coming) as soon as I find them in the bookstore."
1,Murky unbelievable plot,"I am an avid Francis fan. He, along with Clancy and Hillerman, are the only authors whose books I will buy as soon as they hit the shelves. He writes interesting stories, wonderfully developed characters, and makes you care about the people in his books. His evil twin must have written this book. I was so disappointed. The plot made not sense, and I did not care one bit about his characters. There was even a point where I hoped the two protagonists would die in the hurricane and put me out of my misery. One other note, as a private pilot I know that no sane pilot would do nor be allowed to do what the pilot in the story did. It would have been suicide in a light plane. Here is hoping that the real Dick Francis returns."
2,readable yet sub-par for Dick Francis,As a Dick Francis fan you must get this book to complete your collection.However do not expect the usual Dick Francis style.The story was very disjointed and lacked the usual page turning engrossment that you get with a Dick Francis mystery.It also seemed at times that the main characters had knowledge of things that according to the story there was no way they could have been privy to.This is the only novel by Francis that I've not been completely thrilled with.Please forgive my honesty Mr.Francis.
1,Second Wind,"Disappointed is all I can say. Being a horse person, I was excited when I read my first Dick Francis book, ""Hot Money"". Here was a person who could write an intriguing mystery that involved horses. And he actually knew what he was talking about! The stories were very believable and the characters were people you thought you already knew. But with Second Wind, I'm wondering where the horses went?! I learned more about meterolgy and weather forcasting than I ever cared to. Perry Stuart is the typical Dick Francis hero, but the other characters leave me wanting. Halfway through the book, and the ""mystery"" is just starting to unfold. Three pages of ""horsey' reference in the beginning do not make this a book he usually provides. I will continue to get his books as they come out. But for now I will reread the books that got me hooked on him in the first place."
2,Way below par for this author,"Dick Francis is one of my favorite authors. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst of his novels. The plot is confused, and loose ends are never cleared up. The worst problem is that the group of people who are his antagonists are completely unbelievable"
3,Beginner???,"Just wanted to say I found the book informative but not actually for a true beginner, a first timer who wanted to try painting in oils. The book used lots of words and terms of reference that were unfamiliar to me without first explaining what these terms and words actually meant.Other than that I must admit I have learnt a lot from the book and would recommend it to someone with some familarity with the genre or a beginner with more brains than me perhaps.Thanks"
4,"Very nice, not for professionals","As the first book I ever bought on painting with oil colours, I didn't know what to expect. Well, this book is really a great reference, covers everything - charecteristics of specific pigments, how to prime canvas and panels, which mediums do what.. and it has some very helpful demonstrations. What I was missing, is any word about glazing, which medium to use with oils (actuall ratio of distilled turpentine to linseed oil and so on), anything that someone that wants to be more of a pro would look for. But still, a great book.Also, since the author uses water-soluble oils, it is a very good book for people that use those. He explains everything for those too."
5,excellent,"This is a must have for beginning oil painters. It is well structured, it deals with all necessary aspects in a very concise manner and it is full of beautiful examples in full colour. An excellent reference."
4,Overall its a satisfactory guide,"All reference books on oil painting seem very identical. If you read more then 10 books on oil painting, you will notice that most of them look alike or are duplicates to some point. I was expecting more in depth approach to the different types of oil painting techniques rather then a brief overview which we all already know, even more then that. This is definitely not a reference for both: beginners and professionals. maybe more for beginners. the author is a great artist, but to write a book requires more then just being a great artist. I wouldnt waiste money on this kind of books. you can find more and much better info and free tutorials on howto.coma dn ask.com, as well as many other websites."
4,Good book for an overview,"This is a good overview. It is a good reference tohave around, particularly for amateurs who seek straight forward information."
4,Tastes like Snapple,"Bought this to supplement my son's Snapple addiction - he swears the Peach and Raspberry taste just like it. On the downside, the drink mix contains a LOT of sugar (the diet version didn't pass the test)."
5,Lose the cables!,"Amazing product! Mounts directly into your cigarette lighter and powers the iPod flawlessly. This is NOT some flimsy plastic piece of junk, this mounting device holds strong and the soft clamps on the side holds the device without fail. Device angles to optimal access and stays in place when pushing buttons. The sound comes in clear and strong."
1,Don't buy this device,"I purchased this device, because it was advertised to be just like my old fm transmitter which I broke the arm off after 3 years of shoving it in my glove box. Well, this is not the Satechi fm transmitter they advertised. It gives you 3 channel selections, rather than being able to choose from any that work. The side arms do not adjust, so there is no way this would hold any ipod or iphone. Mine came in a package that said it had a remote, however the package was open, there was no remote and the device was scratched and very used looking. Then, to top everything off, I had to submit an application to return it!! Needless to say, my request was approved, but this was a giant headache leaving me very frustrated and still unable to listen to my iphone in my car."
3,Eh.....,"This product holds the iPod great, but the sound quality is poor, and it often very full of static. It serves it's purpose, but not very well."
3,IPOD Charger,Great for what it does. It charges and plays at the same time. Love that feature. The holder isn't quite tight enough to hold the ipod in place so its constantly dangling from the cord. I've had to put a hair tie around the entire base to hold the ipod in place. The holder is a bit big and bulky and blocks access to cup holders. In a smaller car it bumps against the gear changer. The idea of it all is great if your going to plug in and let play. My kids say that its too hard to access for song surfing as teenagers feel the need to do. It needs a longer cord.
5,Great for all skill levels!!,I really like this book. The instructions are very easy to follow and the patterns are very unique. Houndstooth and Broken Bricks are my favorite. I love that there are several example photos of each pattern (in full color) so you can see different variations of the same pattern.
3,All good quilts -- but one critical error inside!,"I bought this book in 2001 and, at the time, made several of the quilts. The directions are easy to follow, as I recalled, and so I picked up the book again recently to make a baby quilt. I am working on ""Woven Ribbons"" and notice there is an error in the directions. If you make this quilt, be sure to cut 8 (not 6) of the FQ 2 strips and then proceed according to the instructions. All else seems to be fine. Good luck!"
5,Great Film,This is such a great film. You will definitely get good negatives if you develop your own film. This is my favourite film.
1,Terrible film,"The film canisters I've got are broken- they won't wind in any of my cameras, the cases are cracked a bit, and they just can't seem to work in either A) My Canon AE-1, B) My Minolta, or C) My Holga35mm . Waste of money- wouldn't ever do it again."
1,Worse than bad.,"I received 3 rolls of the Neopan 400 Professional black and white from Amazon: I've used two of the three, and both rolls yielded completely blank film upon development. I've used my camera and settings using other film on the same day, and those have turned out fine: it's the film. Not sure that I want to risk losing more memories by using the last roll."
4,A little too advanced for me.,"I like facts and figures in reference books but this book overloads the reader (me). So much technical info that only a rocket scientist would really understand. If you want to know about ever feature of the saturn V, this is the book for you."
4,Great transmitter for the price,"A great 6 channel (4 analog, 2 digital) transmitter. This kit comes with channel 89 crystals.My only complaint is that this thing is just massive. Most of the time that won't matter much but it just happens to for my application."
3,Over commercialised and CD Dongle,"The game play is alright, graphics don't have to be fancy for board games. My problem with the whole Hoyle game line is the Annoyance screens for their other game packages when you quit.I can see this being in a Demo, but was really mad when it was there in game that I purchased. Another Anoyance is the CD dongle. Character speech files are kept on the CD, you have to have the CD in to hear it. There is also an annoying delay that freezes game play When the cd spins up when a character speaksthe games play just like the board versions but it could have been designed better and without the annoyance advertisements"
5,Hoyle Games,"I enjoy playing this. It has several great games. I really like playing the backgammon games, but all the games are fun."
1,Installation Problems,"A previous reviewer said it was tough to install on iMac OsX. that's the problem I'm having. I get an error message that say 1008:9,-5000. Can anyone help me out?"
4,A Hit!,"Works well for adults with disabilities too. A good battleships game, and an animated War card game. Go Fish gets really fishy! Many good games here, not all are card games."
5,Meet Merle Haggard,"A quick review- I love all SB releases, easily one of the best of the not-too-well known 70's groups. This one has beautiful songs and singing- Sunbird, When the Night Comes Down, On the Rocks, One More Night with You, Easy Come, Easy Go, First Love. I was surprised to find that Merle Haggard covered ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" (on Bear Family set The Troubadour); sounds great. The Everly Brothers covered their ""Arms of Mary"" (from Reach for the Sky). The SB's are (were) ""real""; genuine and heartfelt music that moves the soul, with clear vocal harmonies and sparkling guitars. I wish more people knew about them. I hope some music company re-issues all their music in a quality package; it would gladden the world (well, the few who know these guys). ""The Pie"", from their first release, is one of the most beautiful songs I know."
4,Straight talk on Annulments in the Catholic Church,"Ida Iris Miranda knows what she is talking about. Her historical references and theology of Marriage lay a clear groundwork for the annulment process. Many people never enter this process because they do not understand what it says about the marriage that ended; or view it as an authoritative process that is offensive; or think it costs basket loads of money; or they think they will not get the annulment.She offers short vignettes of people who have been affected by the process. She explains the benefits of the process when it is pastorally presented to likely candidates. She explains how the process works.The appendix contains a collection of generic forms that one might encounter in the annulment process in any diocese.This is a quick, easy and very interesting read for anyone wanting to know more about this healing process in the Catholic Church."
3,Limits on wealth?,"On page 168, the author writes, ""People must learn that after the first million or so, there is no more use to gaining more money."" What an idiotic and unBiblical thing for the author to say! Many mines that produce the things that the world needs, require capital investment of up to $2-7 billion! Mexican mines are often undercapitalized, and the owners have never saved, nor invested, to the extent that Americans will do. China suffers similarly, from the communist sentiment expressed above, and likewise has underdeveloped mines; from lack of capital, to lack of engineering expertise. Job, Abraham, and Jacob were all extremely wealthy. If Joseph in Egypt did not have the wealth of the entire kingdom of Egypt at his disposal, he would not have been able to spare the nation, and surrounding nations, from the 7 year famine!"
3,A Good Introduction to Art with Mediocre Rhyming Text,"It's nice to find a board book that introduces higher culture to very young children. This one presents ten of Vincent Van Gogh's most famous paintings (Sunflowers, Irises, Haystacks in Provence, Olive Grove, The Sower, The Reaper (After Millet), First Steps (After Millet), Women Picking Olives, The Siesta, and The Starry Night) along with simple, rhyming text. This could be a great addition to a toddler's library, but the text is very choppy, bringing the ideas in the paintings together very loosely. It's a good ""read-alone"" for preverbal toddlers, but is annoying for adults to read aloud. It might have been better to simply introduce the paintings by name and leave it at that."
5,Wonderful series,We love this series of books. We began reading them to our daughter when she was first born. They are an excellent way to expose your children to beautiful works of art as well as rhythmic stories.
5,Delightful!,"I love how the text draws the reader to not only look at the painting but to live inside it a little. It fosters being an active participant in enjoying art, by imagining yourself inside the scene and what you'd be doing in it, or by describing the details within the painting. Since childhood I myself have done this, and it's a pleasure to begin the suggestion of this process to my baby daughter. At 5 months she likes looking at the pictures and enjoys the cute lilting rhymes, I can't wait til she's older and gets into the more interactive aspects. It'll be a great precursor to visiting museums and appreciating fine art."
5,Great little books,We bought 4 books in this artist series. It is wonderful to share such great art with our little granddaughter. The mini stories and the grand paintings make for an enjoyable and early education for babies.
3,"Good, could be better","I liked the content but was disappointed by the small size of the book limiting the beauty of the paintings. A larger size format would have been better. For those interested in initiating little ones to Van Gogh, particularly for classroom use, I recommend ""Vincent's colors"" appropriate for ages 2- 5"
3,"I love the pictures, of course...","And I do intend to buy more books in this series. However, it is unlikely that I'll be reading them aloud to my niece. Instead, they'll be her books to sit with and look at.The text is outright painful in places, with awkward stress and forced rhymes. For example, the last rhyme goes ""Plant and pick, sow and reap, all things that grow need time for sleep, in the quiet light of a starry night"". The last two lines disturb the general four-line pattern of the book. Or another one talks about how babies' steps are careful and slow - and take time to grow? Steps grow? Since when? That's not even the worst of it.The authors would have done better if they'd given up on rhyming and just written a sentence or two of prose for every picture. Not every toddler book *has* to rhyme, after all."
1,Are you all deaf?,"Mr. Airplane Man is a technical nightmare. They are not good musicians, and no amount of ""rock and roll"" angst and attitude can fool those who respect real musical talent. This band is for the lemmings."
2,Crappy Rail,"This was a very disappointing product. Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product. It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it. It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood. There goes the portability of it! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"
3,ok definetely could be better,Pretty good for the price but not what i was hoping for.i bought this rail so that i could learn to boardslide and do other types of grinds. the one problem with this rail that i was disappointed in was that the real is only 4 ft 2 in long and i was expecting a six foot rail.the one good thing in the rail being short is that you don't need to go fast to get through the whole rail so if you fall it will not hurt as much as it would if you were going fast. Overall pretty good rail for the price and for beginners if you are more advanced get something else.
5,Good Buy!,"If you know someone who needs a giant sized Christmas stocking, this one is a winner--and decently priced! It held all the little stocking stuffers intended for it, and then-some. The quality is awesome for the price! Very cute, too."
1,horrible,This is the worse wax ever! it does not melt evenly at all. once you try & apply it..it hardens sooooo much & is painful to pull off any facial area. It is stringy when melted & not easy to apply. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a negative 10. Beware of this product!!
3,Meh...,I like the firmness and that it is easy to clean up and sanitize but It just doesn't have enough girth to do anything for me.....
5,a terrific book,"This book has more practical suggestions and ideas than just about any other business book I have read. What I liked the most is that the author has been a part of building and managing real companies and is not some ""expert"" just talking about theories like we see so much of in business books today. This book and ""Good to Great"" are the two best books out there."
5,Solid Strategies from an industry insider,"I know and admire Scott McKain. He is Vice Chairman of a business conglomerate and a veteran media personality. His insights into how regular businesses can learn much from the entertainment industry are right on target. Learn, as I have, how to attract an audience, win them over, hold their attention, stimulate word of mouth promotion and gain their allegiance. Build a following for your business like entertainment companies do for theirs.Not only is this fascinating, it is also fun to read. Scott has visited with John Travolta, Tom Cruise, and scores of other celebrities, many of the stars of the music industry, TV executives, talent agents, business owners and best selling authors to bring you ideas that will create a blockbuster for you!"
2,Lacks Entertainment Value,"Mr. McKain likes to reference show business in his book. And what makes a movie great is how it develops a tight plot and then keeps its audience engaged. This book contains enough good material to fill 50 pages but then is streteced to 200. Mr. McKain's biographical perspective of himself is also a little too much for my taste.A couple good concepts, but generally a weak and unengaging read."
4,Great if you like space,Overall this is a fairly good DVD set to get. I found it a bit long winded in parts. Looking at out of focus numbers on a control panel doesn't really do it for me. I would have like to have more commentary about what is happening. Besides that I found it really interesting and enjoyed watching it. If you are into the Apollo missions then you want be disappointed with this DVD set.
1,There are better books available,"I am not, by any means, a mathematician but this book was required for my College Algebra course. The examples given are very far a few between and steps are usually even skipped while explaining some concepts or examples. There are simple too many gaps left for the student to fill in for themselves. If you are VERY proficient in math than this book will serve you well. But if you like me and your not a math major but need to get the class out of the way, than beware this book! I HIGHLY recommend investing in another book to supplement this one. There are many online resources (such as purplemath.com) that also help keep you up to speed. Either way, do not depend on JUST this book to help you understand the material. College Algebra Demystified also does a very good job at explaining what this book does not and in a much more straight forward and easy-to-understand way."
1,Worst College Algebra text ever!!!,"In other pre-Algebra courses I used text's by Blitzer and could figure out and remember what to do without even attending a lecture. His texts were great with tons of examples and practical uses and everything was easily explained and subject matter seemed to flow from one concept to another seamlessly in a way that built upon each chapter. Sullivan's text on the other hand is the worst text I've ever come across in my life. There are too few examples, hardly enough practical uses explained, not nearly as clear of an explanation, and poor organization of the contents. The contents seem as though they are jumbled together and rarely seem to build directly off the previous chapters. The explanaitions were so bad I didn't even understand them when the teacher was explaining what was in the book. I you have to buy it go ahead if you don't run away as fast as you can from this book."
3,"Book is fine, shipping, not so much.","Paid extra for expedited shipping, which didn't happen. I ended up having to drop the class because the book didn't arrive in time to take with me on my trip, so I couldn't do the mandatory first assignment, which was due before I could get back home to use the book."
3,Just a Textbook,"This book provides examples which explain mathematical concept step by step so that it is easy to understand. However, some of the example or content describe too much which make me confuse. This problem also appears in the MyMathLab examples. Moreover, this book creates many formulas from one basic formula that is not necessary."
5,"This is the best of the best for my dog, I'll buy more from you.",This shampoo is the 2nd bottle I use for my mutt. Anyone should use this product at least once & decide for themselves. You'll see.
5,Great for any dog!,"I have three large dogs. All have different coat lengths and types. I use this shampoo for all three and it works great. One dog, a Rottweiller, tends to dry skin and this helps. All you Labrador owners - scrub this in well, rinse, and wait for dog (all day - LOL) to dry. Really fluffs up coat and makes brushing very worthwhile. Can really get those ""dead hairs"" out! Shampoo has a gentle smell that is very pleasant."
3,A stimulating read,"I agree with the difficulty in the read, but I will blame it on a poor translation than Attali's writing prowess (not that I have compared with the French version). The ideas in the book are not very complex, so they do not necessarily require such awkward phrasing.It is too bad, because there is a lot of value in this text, but its language is holding it back from reaching a wider audience, which is sort of ironic since Attali urges renewed study and composition of music by non-specialists. Many advanced topics (which this text does not really contain) can be explained to almost anyone if they truly understand a topic. If a new edition is printed, please revise the translation!!"
5,Performs just as advertised and very light weight,"I bought this watch because I don't like buying batteries. My previous watch is a autowinding casio (kinetic auto-relay) and it is really heavy. That watch started to put my hand to sleep. So... I bought this one thinking it would be lightweight and it is!To charge, put it outside on a bright day and leave it there for about 4 hours. I did this once, and the charge indicator has been at the highest level for more than two months of not even thinking about it.The automatic light feature is fantastic, but when it is dark (the only time it comes on) you must look closely to see the time since the light is bright and the hands kinda blend in, but maybe in the dark your pupils just need to get use to a bright light?It syncs flawlessly to the automic clock, and when you change the timezone to a place that is not in range, the watch does not try to download the time.Best of all, it is kinda nice looking"
4,"Solar power, a benefit and a concern","My initial purpose was to obtain a watch that kept precisely accurate time based on the broadcast time signal from Ft. Collins CO and this watch does that very well. It was delivered without a fully charged battery and I am yet unsure how long it will run on a stage 2 charge. So far, so good. I have been unable to increase the charge to stage 1 as the days are now short and there is little opportunity to get direct sunlight. The additional chronograph features are of little interest to me, but had to be included to obtain a model that featured solar power operation. The watch is certainly worth the price."
3,Great Quality but Missing the Bass,"I needed headphones to work for late-night movie editing, so I did my homework and got these headphones. At first, I liked them enough to give them a five-star rating, but after a while of listening to the headphones and then listening to my computer speakers, I realized what was missing from the headphones: barely any bass. The dynamic sound range and clear and sharpness was very good, but music and the human voice is just missing something without the bass. Overall, I recommend the product only to those who cannot stand any bass at all.OVERVIEWPros:-Clear and Sharp Sound-Dynamic Range-Easy-to-carry Fold-up Design-Gold Cord (I think it has one, because it sure looks like it compared to some of my other gold wires)Cons:-No Bass-Clunky to Wear"
5,A great system at a good price.,I bough this system about a month ago and I must say that I am liking it quite a bit. With a few exceptions the setup was easy. The instructions that come with the system is somewhat convoluted but overall clear. The actual operation of the receiver is so easy even a trained monkey could figure it out. It is feature rich and comes with nice connectivity for most of the things you might want to connect to it. The speakers and the subwoofer are more then adequate and add to the overall effectiveness off the system. As for the DVD player itself it's a pretty nice one. The 5 disk carousel is nice and convenient. Overall it is easy to switch between disks and it does have multi disk resume. The only real pet peeve that I have about the DVD player is that it dos not have menu navigation controls on the player face; this forces one to use the remote. Other then this I would def buy this system again.
2,BUZZZZZZZ...,"I was very pleased with this system for the first month or so I owned it (better speakers would make it much better though..); However, shortly after that it began making a loud intermittent buzzing noise. This noise ranges from almost imperceptible, to so loud it drowns out almost all other audio output. It seems to be coming from the satelite speakers only.I have a friend with a different Sony system and he has a similar problem with his subwoofer. (Maybe this is a problem with Sony products in general?) He tried to get it serviced and was told there was nothing wrong with it. I hope I have better luck, as this can really be a great system on the rare occasion that I can hear it over the sometimes thundering buzz!"
1,Do not buy from Sony!!!,This is the 3rd home theather Sony branded I have. I bought this unit less than a year ago and the display went dead suddenly. Now Sony is charging me $200 to have it fixed. What a disappointment for a company that claims to be best in class. Never will do business with them again.
1,John,Not a good choice. If you do not have a small head the band will feel too tight. The eye covers do block out the light nicely but it is hard and not very flexible. The only reason I did not return this item is because the return shipping would be more than the refund.
5,An important introduction to the mothers movement of today,"Skip ""Perfect Madness"" and read this instead. Peskowitz has researched her topic thoroughly, and it shows in this thoughtful, important book. After reading this book and ""Perfect Madness,"" I was puzzled that ""The Truth Behind the Mommy Wars"" has received comparatively little media attention. Unlike Warner, Peskowitz analyzes how cultural attitudes about parenting and the ideal worker affect mothers in all socioeconomic classes - and she does so with style and grace."
3,Somewhat interesting,"This book is somewhat thought provoking, but quickly redundant. The theory that working moms and stay at home moms are at war felt artificial and the resources used to support that this war is going on seemed either unbelievable to me or that I must be missing something. In real life, while there is guilt and mixed feelings about being one or the other, I don't see this as a huge struggle for women. We don't have time to be at war with each other, being a mother is hard and we are all trying to work it. Any attempt to make this a war seems media driven, and I imagine this book feeds from this drama, although again, I haven't seen this to be a huge issue. But then again, I don't watch talk shows, so maybe I'm missing something."
5,A good selection.,"This is an enjoyable and unusually simple story, lacking the typical complicated pretensions of the literary genre. You could call it a picaresque novel, in that it shows a young man of the tender age of 15 learning hard lessons and gaining maturity. He gets in a fight with his so-called best friend, then goes away and meets the girl-of-his-dreams, and gains a few insights into how to act cool along the way to getting his heart broken. He picks himself up, brushes himself off, and watches his favorite baseball team beat the Boston Red Sox. Besides being a Red Sox fan I liked this book a lot ! Levi Asher the author is from the LitKicks website."
2,"I'm a Red Sox fan, so . . .","I know the other reviewers found the simplistic style of writing enjoyable but it quickly begins to read like an undergraduate creative writing final. Also, the writing suffers from character overdose: ""Sheryl and Jeff and the other people with them left, leaving Sean and Patty and Eileen and Adam and Phil with about a quarter of a case of beer."" I have read some of Levi Asher's poetry so I know he is capable of more artistic writing."
4,Crazy Demo,"I don't own ""Word Games"" but I guess I'm going to have to break down and buy it because I've been playing the demo version of ""Word Yacht"" and I love the game but the Chemistry Teacher's remarks are driving me crazy. I need the complete version of the game so I can readjust her mouth! Without having played the complete version, I can't give it more than a four."
4,FUN GAME,I played the demo game that game with my computer for a long time but didn't have it on my new laptap so decided to purchase the game. It is even more fun and has a lot more options. Glad I got it!
2,misled,"I was expecting some music. Boy, was I disappointed! These are documentaries. No music except a very, very few partial (I do mean PARTIAL) song choices. If you want biographies this is what you'll get."
1,Ugh!,I was very disappointed in this dvd. There is no music from either artist included and there was a lot of dialogue that wasn't even about the artists.
3,More Biblical epic than disaster movie,"I'd heard that Harryhausen and Bradbury were both smitten with this film and King Kong when they were first shown in theaters, so I finally took an opportunity to see it. However, this has much more in common with Biblical films like The Robe, Ben Hur and Barabbas than with movies that center on a natural disaster. The destruction in the film is from earthquake, lava and volcanic bombs rather than the ash fall that we know today preserved this town and others. Basil Rathbone's performance is the best part of this show. I wouldn't buy it for just the volcano aspect."
4,worth a look,"fine acting, especially by rathbone. but for me, a movie that has the courage of it's convictions, regarding the very last scene, a scene that makes the movie a stand out. most religous movies would skirt the issue of repentance and showing of the Christ. not this one, which makes it very special in my book."
4,More Than A Rehash of The Previous Edition,"I bought the edition for Word 2000 with some trepidation, concerned that it would be only a rehash of the (excellent) edition for Word 97. However, I found that it has been updated very thoroughly to reflect the functional differences between Word 97 and Word 2000. It remains a very useful reference for sole practitioners who automate their own document generation. The reason it only rates 4 stars: I would have preferred a more robust description of the uses to which fields can be put in automating pleading (and other legal document) generating."
2,"Kodaly, 9 Pieces and 7 Pieces for Solo Piano",These are Kodaly's best works. As for this performance:1. too slow2. too mechanical3. too forcefulThis music should be played delicately.
3,Sunshade,Sturdy but difficult to use! The quality is high but because it is so rigid it is quite akward to place in and remove from windshield. Perhaps over time it becomes broken in?
1,front end broke off after one hit,The care looks nice but the durability was an issue. Was also completely destroyed after four three minute races. Also the paint didn't stick in all of the grooves.
5,All Touching Stories,A collection of touching stories based on Vera Dalia's return to the land of her birth (Czechoslovakia) to find out what happened to friends and relatives left behind at the time of the Holocaust. The book represents the culmination of a ten year effort to memorialize on paper the deeds of some vary courageous individuals who risked everything to help their Jewish neighbors escape persecution and certain death at the hands of the Nazi. Dr. Dalia shares her reflections as she meets the survivors of a horrific time for Jews and others during World War Two. Thank you Vera for sharing.
3,Stick with Regular Huggies Wipes,"I have been using Huggies Wipes for more than 10 years now, with my 2 year old the current target of the wipes. I also use shea butter on my 13 year old's skin when it's dry and chafed, so when I saw the Huggies Wipes with Shea Butter I decided to give them a try -- what better way to keep my toddler's little rear in baby-soft shape? WRONG! First, the scent of the shea butter really turned my stomach and I'm not normally scent sensitive. Worse, the additional moisture from the shea butter made my son rash out! I threw the wipes out and went back to the regular Huggies wipes, and his rash went away in a couple of days. If your baby has sensitive skin or if you are sensitive to fragrances, skip this product. Otherwise, I suppose it works as well as the aloe and lavendar varieties (whose scents don't affect me like the shea butter one did!)."
5,Works great!,"I was pretty skeptical about this bra, especially since I am a C cup. It stayed put all night and looked great under my dress that had a little opening in the back that prevented me from wearing a traditional bra. I was afraid it would hurt to remove, but it wasn't bad at all. I suggest you try it out prior to the day you plan on wearing it, because it took a few tries to get the position right. I even managed to have a little lift. Pretty impressive for a bra that doesn't have straps or a band!"
2,Eh! Not for me.,Didn't serve the purpose for what it was intended. I use them as inserts in my bras to add fullness now that the tacky'ness is no longer.
3,Bleh,"Yeah, so I have a larger chest and I bought these and I don't think I liked them. I need more support than that and I tried to wear them with this cute halter top and walked around for a little bit, but decided to take them off because I felt too exposed, and it would smack me in the face when I walked down the stairs. It's not that my chest is that huge, but when they are tied together without support they act as one to kill me."
1,"Size ""D"" cup? NO WAY!","RETURNING WITH GREAT JOY ABOUT GETTING MY MONEY BACK!Note my reviews: I do not normally pan a product and try to look for the good, but...Ordered with high hopes -- in ""D"" cup size. If this is a ""D"", I would hate to see the smaller sizes. These barely covered a portion of a breast; ladies, you'll be better off with petals just to take care of ""headlights"". There is no lift whatsoever and no way to make any ""lift"" for your twins. Removing them is PAINFUL (yes, I know how to follow directions).To be fair: if you need cleavage, and are VERY small, these would likely work quite well if you could get them positioned correctly prior to snapping the two separate cups together.SUMMARY: pointless for larger than a ""B"" cup. Actually, they're horrible and a waste of time/money."
1,dont waste your money,"Product does not work. Ordered a size C which I am and way too small of a fit. Also, couldn't return for credit or replacement and was not told that when ordering. Very disatisfied with product and Amazon."
4,It takes practice...,"It takes a few tries to get them just right, especially if you don't want the stick'ums to show! But they do stick well and feel secure once placed in a good position. Great solution for my backless wedding gown. Thumbs up."
5,I love it,"It is a really good bra, works perfectly with all kind of shirts, dresses, etc. I dont recomend you to wear it all day long, its excellet for a few hours, because it has a glue that makes you sweat a lot and causes the take off."
3,no straps from Amazon,"Minimal support. Decent cleavage possible. Size waaaay off-normally B cup, take a D in the NuBra lite. Comfortable because it eliminates straps. Cannot use any lotion, cream or oil on your skin or you'll be 'swinging'. Sweating on hot,humid days can also decrease the adhesive properties. Worth having but not an everyday bra. Overall-glad I have a couple of them just wish they were more reliable for summer wear."
1,Bad fit,After hearing great reviews I got this product for myself. Unfortunately I doesn't fit properly and holds little support. I wore it with some tops and was horrified after looking in the mirror and seeing it show. Not a good product for a D cup.
1,Doesn't Stick in Mildly Warm Weather,"I had really high hopes for this bra. It was a good shape, didn't show any lines or seams under clothing, low enough to wear under low-cut tops and dresses and it seemed like it was just about perfect. And it was, until about one hour after putting it on. I'd followed the directions carefully but after one hour in a somewhat warm church (perhaps 75 degrees) for a wedding the bra was barely on and I had to keep adjusting it for the rest of the day! One cup wouldn't stay on at all, the other only stayed for about 2 minutes and then I'd have to re-adjust. This was so uncomfortable and I hated trying to hide the constant adjusting I was having to do. It also made it hard to keep hidden beneath my v-neck dress as it kept popping up and peeking out of the v-neck. I would not recommend this at all and am so unhappy that I wasted my money and time with this product! I actually threw it out when I was finally able to change!"
4,Great multipurpose bra!,"I love this bra as it is so versatile for wearing almost any outfit. It sticks well and even gives ""the girls"" a lift. I am 32 D so these usually do not work for me, but I keep buying these whenever they lose their stick. I have 4 friends who I also got to buy them and they love them too. The only thing I do not like is that when it's hot/humid outside these are not absorbent so sweat pools underneath your chest. Definitely learned my lesson not to wear this bra during the summer while wearing any grey or silky fabrics! Very embarassing, but overall a great product."
4,Works great but only lasts for so long,They worked really well but the sticky-ness wears off over time. You can only handwash these but be careful of the soap you use.
2,right size,A wonderful product for women with smaller breast probably a 34 or 36 cup. I wish I had researched more to know if it would work for bustier women because mine didn't even lift my nipples; I am a 38c and have very heavy breast for my size.
4,Nubra Size C,This product was well worth the money. I ordered a size up and it fits perfect. Stayed in place the entire night.
2,Ultralite Nubra,It was not at all what I expected. Ordered at my wife's request and she was very disappointed. Very impractical in my opinion.
2,Not a great as I hoped it would be,"Unfortunately this bra doesn't work well on every body type. I agree that it works best if you have the petite model body type. I'm average sized and size B chest and it made my chest look smaller, sad to say. I found it doesn't stick as well after a few uses, even after washing. I ended up using little pins to pin in on my outfits, afraid it would unstick from my body in public."
1,You dont get what you pay for.,"I bought this for vacation to wear with strapless and backless tops. The first time i wore it, it worked okay but it provides very little support so if you are big chested i don't recommend this. The packaging says that you can wear this up to 50 times well after i wore it 3 times it would no longer stick to me and i was unable to wear it again. Not very happy that i paid over 26 dollars for a bra that i could only wear 3 times definitely not worth it. I took care of it and cleaned it like you are supposed to. Very disappointed with this purchase."
4,Great!,"This was my first time wearing an adhesive bra and it was great. I read the previous reviews about how to put it on (bending forward) and managed to get a great look under a stappy silk jersey dress-- no lumps or bumps! It isn't fun taking it off but it's not painful, either. I can't imagine that wearing one of these all the time would be good for your girls in terms of gravity and the necessary pulling required to take it off, but it's great for special occasions. Like previous reviewers, I bought a size up (I'm borderline B-C and bought the C). There is no way I could have fit the B so be sure to size up!"
2,Just plain didn't work,"Despite my best efforts and a lot of research before I bought the product, it just didn't work for me. I'm between a B and a C so bought the C and it still wasn't big enough and would not ""hold me up"". Let a friend borrow it and she had the same problem. Disappointed."
1,Nu-bra,"This bra does not fit. The company advertises returns, but said it wouldn't take this bra as a return..due to hygiene. It was not worn. Had all the packaging. Their whole company is intimates, so not sure why they say returns when they should say NO returns. Will NEVER buy from again, and I shop on the internet A LOT!"
2,just larger pasties,If you have size C and larger do not get this product. The mechanics of this bra is very similar to a glue sticker (pasties). There is no side support as in other backless bras. So the clothing looks more provocative especially when you walk. Since it ha zero support it cannot provide lift or cleavage.
2,Much too small for larger breasts,"This bra would probably work really well for women with smaller breasts. The adhesive is very strong and it sticks well too the skin. However, I will not be wearing this as it is WAY too small for my chest size. I ordered a D cup which is my normal bra size but the cups are closer to a B. They barely cover anything so it does basically nothing for me. Good idea for a backless bra, I just wish there were bigger cups."
2,This isn't for everyone.,"This isn't for everyone. If you don't have light perky boobs, or look like the model in the picture; this isn't for you!I'm 5'6""; wear size 8 clothing (sometimes wear a size 10). On average I wear small and/or medium shirts. I'm a FULL C CUP and can't go braless... (Some women of my size can, but I can't!) Bought this hoping to wear something backless and it did nothing for me. Don't even think the bra cup was true to size.Money down the drain"
2,Not for women with bigger chest sizes,"I figured I'd give this a shot, knowing that I'm a D cup. Yeah, it just not going to work. It's such a good concept, but it just doesn't work if you are bigger chested. Maybe it might work if you have implants that don't need support, but as far as non perky boobs, there's just no way. My son, who is one, decided it was a great belly cover though. At least someone in the house is getting use out of them.I should add that if you take it off slowly, there's no pain. Pretty easy to put on and snap, but it's really only to pull the breasts together, no support whatsoever. I'll probably give it another shot once I buy some of that nifty tape that gives support. If I ever actually try that, I'll give an update."
5,watch out for that dial up,"I love this computer, don't get me wrong,but connecting it to my home ethernet modem was a little bit of trouble. I connected it using the network port, but could NOT figure out how to turn the dial up off. Every time I tried to make a connection, it would not work. I finally had to call my internet company. Even though the plug is labeled network, it is for Ethernet ( I discovered that about 3 hours later.) Not a big problem though, now obviously I am using the laptop and plan on bringing it to college with me. I love the scroll pad and nothing is wrong with the computer. I bought it brand new and I would totally reccomend it. The battery last's long and the rest of the computer is easy to use :) ENJOY! :)"
4,A great drama + hunkalicious SO JI-SUB is in it,"Oh man, I cannot believe that this series has not been officially released in a box set--and that it is not licensed in the U.S.. Where is So Ji-Sub's management team here?Anyway, on the surface this is a typical K-drama, with a lot of melodrama, coincidences, and love triangles, but just beneath that layer is a truly wonderfully visionary drama about loneliness, mortality, love, love gained and love lost. This series made So Ji-Sub (the lead male character) a superstar, and while how he was overlooked in his other dramas is beyond me (his eyes are AMAZINGLY expressive), this role could not have been pulled off by anyone other than him. His performance is spot-on and he makes the ending so heartrending, I will amazed if the most hardened k-drama-watchers do not sob.BUY this K-Drama!!!! It's worth every penny."
5,A very sad drama and every one should watch it,"At first I was hesitant to watch it because I'm used to watching romantic comedy type of Korean drama series, but every body was saying that I should really watch it. When i got the copy the first few episodes were boring, but once you continue watching the drama you will really feel the story sinking into you.A very sad drama with a great story line and a great cast. So Ji Sup the male lead of the drama really gave a remarkable performance playing the character of Moohyuk. He really deserves winning those awards with his great performance. You can really feel the sadness of his character just by expression of his eyes. Tears will just shed into your eyes as you continue watching it. The soundtrack is also amazing. It fits the story very well. The ending is what every one should watch out for!!!The drama is just so sad, but it is so nice. I am Sorry, I Love You is one of the must see Korean drama series. Korean dramas entertains me alot!!!"
4,My favorite drama,"These DVDs arrived factory-sealed and in perfect condition. The subtitles were obviously written by someone with limited knowledge of the English language, but do not affect understanding of the plot."
1,Not all natural as it claims!,This has added artificial coloring so the description of all natural no artificial colors is FALSE! Why do companies insist on adding artificial colors to everything? This product description needs to be fixed so that it is not misleading.
5,in a word...,"yum!(mix it with lemonade, punch, tang, any other powder drink, or have it quite wonderfully on its own)i say again:yum!"
2,It is weak.,"As one said: I cannot call it a ""grinder"" since it jams every 10 sec, you have to help the grinder pull the meat out.You have to make sure there is no fat attached to meat, else it can not grind it and jams."
1,Not a good product,"Mine came smelling of oil. When I cleaned it, it was really dirty especially the grinder plates which were very difficult to clean.Even though I dried it after washing and wiped salad oil over it as recommended in the instruction manual, the grinder plate started to rust.I then realised it is not stainless steel, which I assumed it was as it's meant to process food. Didn't even use it since it rusted before I had the chance to.Really bad product. No more panasonic for me."
1,Leaks Oil into Food,"Unfortunatelly, I have to return this items since it leaks oil or some unidentified black substance into food. After cleaning it a few times and grinding meat for few times it is still leaking. We couldn't figure out the cause of the leak so we have to return it."
1,"quality built, made in Japan, but it is too weak. Returned","This machine is well built, very little noise, and you can feel it is not cheap at all... and it is Made in Japan.... however the motor is only 180 watts, and that is toooooo weak to grind anything. This is not my first grinder, so I know how to use it and how to place the blade.... but trust me it is too weak.... it will choke on everything and anything.... even a small piece of onion...... and the sound of the motor changes indicating that is is exhausted and under heavy load.... i used it twice; once to grind 2 pounds of beef (course) and it did the job, but you could feel that the grinder motor was overloaded and was struggling all the time...personally, I am returning this grinder and will order a more powerful one (sadly, it will be made in China and will be cheaply built... :( )"
3,overpriced,"interestingly, you can get what appears to be the exact same design of grinder at the wal-mart site for $40 less, under the brand name ""back to basics"". i can see a few bucks difference, but that is a lot."
4,good,hi this vest took about 5 days 2 come it cost 28 dollars 4 shipping. when u open this it looks pretty cool. i put it on and shot my self with my spring pistol. it didnt hurt but i still felt it. so if i shot myself with my rifel how would that feel. not very good i asume. the vest is flimsy and protects u with little cusion pads. it does not protect your shoulders and sides and neck or arms. now some good stuff it is light weight and it breaths well. good 34 summer.basicaly this vest only looks cool and protects u from small airsoft guns. i recomend wearing sumthing under it. now i tested it again i shot my self with my rifel and it did not hurt! But i was wearing a sweatshirt. nvr mind go buy!it is okay.4 stars!btw go on youtube and type in molisque to c cool vids!
5,a kids review,this is awsome dont de influenced by the idiot that shot him self i say buy it sure it hurts a little from point blank range but it s only 2 dolars
4,Good looking armor for cost,"I wouldn't wear this armor in an airsoft battle, but for paintball or costuming purposes it more then gets the job done. It's very lightweight, which is a major plus, and for some might make up for the lack of armor. Mobility in this vest is phenomenal, but it comes at the cost of having no armor on the side or along the clavicle. One should take note that its not one size fit all, unless you want to leave the side straps open, but that can be said for many vests and shouldn't really be held against it. Keep in mind that you must put this on over your head unlike most vests. On a closing note you will NOT find a better vest in this price range, and for someone on a budget I'd highly recommend it."
4,Convenient and sturdy,"This vest has many features, it would use an instruction booklet. The zippers and velcro work great and feel very resistant. It has some attaching points in the bottom to grab a tactical belt, and has a patch for a rifle butt to be held."
3,Not So Protection Vest,"The vest is ok, nothing to write home about though.I bought it for my Grandson who wanted to try air-soft, and so for the price it is better then a more expensive one.I would only recommend this one if somebody is just starting out,then if they like air-soft move up to a nicer vest."
3,Protection,My son loves to go play airsoft and there is nothing soft about that game so I wanted him protected.
1,disapoint,"I choose this rating because, the vest was not what i expected at all, it is made of cheep thin packaging foam, it hurts when shot with a airsoft gun, it adds no protection whatsoever, i am very disappointed ."
4,Inexpensive,"A great extra for the boys for Christmas to go with their many other airsoft items. Plus, it provides some protection."
4,Horse Racing and Filmmaking,The author's descriptions of horse racing are as vivid and exciting as ever. The reader gets an added bonus of an in-depth look at filmmaking.
2,It's just not for me,"I had read another review of a Francis book by someone saying they were an avid reader but had never read one of his books and LOVED it. I was in the same boad and when I read the first page or two, this one sounded good to me.I read about a third of this book and put it down. There were two plots going (as far as I read), one, which took up about 30% of what I had read I found was very good. The second plot line I could care less about. I found the language and writing style a bit flowery for my taste as well.Dick Francis has published many books and therefore has many fans, but I find it's just not for me."
4,A novel for the armchair detective,"If you were an ordinary person faced with something intriguing, you don't immediately run out and suddenly become a detective. You try to discover what you can on your own, without much fanfare and without calling attention to yourself. MOst of all, your life remains almost normal. If you're lucky, you solve the mystery. Once you do, you keep quiet about it because the solution probably won't benefit anyone but you. So it is with this book. Thomas Lyon is just an ordinary guy trying to find out the answer to a puzzling revelation. He goes on being a movie director while doing his investigation on the side, inviting a little unwarranted attention from various killers as a result. When he does find the solution, he doesn't tell the police or anybody else, letting them make their own conclusions. After all, the answer would never benefit anyone except his own self-satisfaction."
1,A skewed look at race!,"Vijay Prashad presents the fringe (CPM, bordering on Trotskyite) view of the world. This book is heavy on rhetoric and light on facts. It begins with some interesting ideas but fails completely to deliver a cogent argument."
1,Prashad's Opinions,"The arguments presented by Prashad, though posing to be factually based, are supported by slivers of hard evidence and instead rely on Prashad's flighty opinions. The book clearly displays Prashad's lack of knowledge of the complexities of American history and race formation. Consequently, this book should be read as no more than a simple opinion piece."
5,Loved it,My 2 1/2 year old son originally saw this movie as a rental from the library. He loved it so much that we had to buy it. He is a car/truck lover and thinks this movie is the greatest! It will keep him hooked for the entire duration.
4,great docu but could use a little music,A little more performance video would have been nice to see. But it was still very interesting for a fan.
5,Chemex - excellent coffee,"The Chemex filters were fine of course. You need a Chemex coffee carafe to use them. I highly recommend this for any coffee lover. I have the 2 cup carafe which I use to make a large mug of coffee. It's a bit more time consuming that an automatic drip method but using the Chemex makes a far superior cup of coffee. Bold coffee flavor, no bitterness, just the right temperature. I ignore my plunger pot now in favor of the Chemex...every time."
1,Hoyle Casino faults on startup,"I purchased Hoyle Casino, and it faults on startup every time I try to run it. Sierra product support basically told me ""tough luck"". I will never buy another piece of Sierra ""explodeware"" again."
5,good game,"Wow what a well done game. Play for MANY games and bid ALOT of money. The fun thing about this game is that you have a credit card, and you can bid lots of money and take the risk of winning it or losing it. Very fun game."
1,"I already bought the cd-rom, and it still won't run","I just recently brought the Hoyle Casino 2003 cd-rom from Costco on Maui, put it in the computer, and installed it, but why can't i create a face, on the facemaker ? It's saying that i'm in demo mode, how can that be ?"
3,Partly good and partly bad,"The sound and picture quality is great.The slot machines is what is bad to me because it is not a natural slot as I know. You very rarely win. The same numbers come up and it spoils the game. I quit playing 99% of slots.Sorry, but I have to tell what I feel."
1,Kindle edition is not the book pictured,"I just purchased the book a few minutes ago and have not read it yet, i will read it of that there is no doubt.But what i noticed after opening it is the Kindle version is not the book that is pictured. The (Plus) bits are not included, aparently only the paperback version has these. Loking at the table of contents for the paperback you will see there is a chapter at the very end about the ""Authors further indites"". This chapter is not present in the Kindle version. Also the cover of the Kindle version is different, obviously since it is not the current release of the book.Very disapointed in Amazon for this false advertising."
2,vague and unhelpful,Generic advice available in any meditation book. The author makes it clear that he was not predisposed to depression because it didn't start until he was 37. It probably would have gone away if he had done nothing.
5,Both Compassionate and Practical!,"Starting with my mother's depression when I was small, depression has shadowed my life. I'm almost 70 now, and I've read a lot of books on depression. One thing I want in a book on depression is the ""milk of human kindness."" _The Zen Path through Depression_ is special that way. The author's dharma is, indeed, one that affords refuge. He has learned to be unafraid of depression - he doesn't have to fearfully control it or ""fix"" it. He has faith that, although joy is impermanent, depression is as well"
5,sad its not available,"these are awesome socks, i've bought them before ...too bad they aren't available as i'd buy more.."
2,POOR COMMUNICATION LANGUAGE,"HARD TO UNDERSTAND SCRIP. POOR EXAMPLES. THE WORD ""POT"" FOR EXAMPLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ELECTRICAL OR REFRIGERATION IN THE PAST OR PRESENT."
5,DVD,"This was a Xmas gift and knowing she has other disks of Mash, I am positive this one will be just as rewarding."
5,Landmark Season for the 4077th,"The third season of ""M*A*S*H"" (1974-75) ranks among the finest in television history, with a vast array of creative talent in peak form. Happily, this DVD edition provides the long-awaited opportunity to eliminate the obtrusive laugh track with improved results. Season Three offers a wealth of classic episodes, including ""The General Flipped at Dawn,"" ""Adam's Ribs,"" ""Private Charles Lamb,"" ""Big Mac"" and ""Abyssinia, Henry."" Though the departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers did not affect the show's longevity, the serio-comic tone was notably altered with the addition of Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell to the ensemble. When Lt. Col. Henry Blake's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan, the anarchic spirit of ""M*A*S*H"" died with him."
4,M*A*S*H S-3! Army Fare even Civilians Love!!,"The third season of this classic saw it's popularity overcoming the negative stigma caused by the VietNam Conflict as that dark period of our country's history closed. It also saw a refining of characters, background, and plot, as well as the addition of other gems, including the character of Capt. Calvin Spalding (Loudon Wainwright, III & his guitar) and the first appearance of Harry Morgan, that resulted in some of the best episodes of the series, as well as the first awards and nominations of many that this T.V. Great collected during its' long run.Once again, the reasons this set doesn't make top scores are in production, and not series material; especially the continued omission of special features such as background, interviews, and controls as the ""Play All"" that so many fans wish for. Still, no fan would hesitate to grab up Season Four if it went on sale tomorrow, including this M*A*S*H-aholic!!"
2,"Good show, but 3rd disk has major problems","The 3rd disk of this collection has some serious issues. I have 2 DVD players, a PS2 and a computer. I tried to play the last 4 or 5 episodes and on every player the episodes would chop and studder. I had a replacement set sent, and it has the exact same problem.Fox needs to retransfer the third disk."
4,MASH Season 3,"I bought this for my husband, who is a huge mash fan. We enjoy watching episodes together. Although reruns can frequently be seen on tv, watching episodes sans commercials is a much more enjoyable experience. A must for every Mash fan."
5,Very-Very-h-a-p-p-y,"As far as the show goes its 5 star all the way!!!!!! now as far as amazon goes they are 5 star all the way.I will never order from anyone.They should do like a reward for all the ppl that order from amazon faithly.Maybe something like 1amazon dollar every time you order,or something like that."
5,Best show ever made!,"M*A*S*H is the only show I've ever seen that will tear your heart out, sew it back in, and make you laugh about it."
5,Positively Mash's best season is season #3,Every episode clicks and they have the best episodes imaginable in this season! The cast was totally seasoned to their characters by this time! Among the best eps on here are the General Flipped at Dawn. This ep is of course the one where Gen. Bartford Hamilton Steele (three e's not all of them in a row) shows up at the 4077th and acts zanier than Klinger! He is played by Harry Morgan soon to be Col. Potter in season 4! This ep is jam packed with clever laughs and its the truest winner of them all!
5,Best Cop Show Available,"This series is hands-down the best and most accurate cop show out there. I've been a patrol cop for seventeen years and other than a couple of instances in the show, just about every aspect of SouthLAnd is accurate portrayal of police on the streets."
5,Southland Second Season,"This is the most moving drama on televison. The emotion displayed by the actors is very believable. My son does not talk about his work {policeman},but I understand why."
5,Southland,Southland is such and Awesome show i use to be at work when it comes on so i bought it from Amazon I play it on my laptop.I bought season 1 and 2 i could not buy 3 for what reason i dont know but i know its good. any way i love Southland its a great show like third Watch was and Rescue me. there are not many shows that i watch but Southland is the only one I watch The cast is awesome The story lines are great. This is a great show i highly recommend this show.
1,SOUTHLAND - 2D SEASON,NOT RECEIVED AS OF 4 SEP 11. I AM BEGINNING TO HAVE DOUBTS OBOUT AMAZON. DOES ANYONE AT AMAZON REALLY READ THIS OR PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION??????
2,"Southland, Season 2","Where, oh where are the subtitles or CC? I urge the producersto include CC or subtitles for all future seasons of this show!"
2,"You call this a ""season""?","The ""seasons"" of TV shows have shortened in recent years from episodes in the twenties to the teens; we all know that. But since when do six one-hour episodes count as a season? That's not even a calendar season which would be a miserly thirteen shows! Too many shows have downgraded to 12 or 13, but SIX!! And then to charge $25-35 for it! We need to tell the studios that this is pitiful. It's not worth the investment of money and emotional involvement to get six new episodes in a year and call it a ""complete season."" That's about as complete as congressional reform. Good writing, acting, and production deserve more of a venue than a six-episode ""season."""
4,"Excelent tea, but so difficult for shipping","I like so much this tea, but 2 times the cans were delivered broken with the tea powder getting out from the package, 3 of 6 cans are broken , I think this product has to be shipped with more protection, due UPS and Fedex always throw out the shipping boxes so much."
2,Sugar based,Too many calories for my taste. Nothing against the product. As described by manufacture. Taste good is you want calories
5,I love this citrus green tea!,"I love this sweetened tea in this packaging. I found this a few years ago and fell in love--because you can control the strength and sweetness. I have looked high and low for this in the stores and finally had Amazon regularly ship it to me. Please Amazon, keep it in stock!"
1,"Did not work, But easy to return.",the car adapter was broken and then we found out the player it self did not work. The refunded all money with no problems. Would buy from this seller again.
5,excellent value,"excellent value and excellent product! the picture was very clear and the carrying case, car charger and headphones all worked very well and were very convenient for my son on our recent vacations. i would definitely recommend this product."
1,Buy something else,"I tried to mount this in my daughter's Lexus and it simply wouldn't mount so that the screen was visible to my grandchild riding in the rear seat. Also, when it was mounted, no one was able to sit comfortably in the front seat due to the lower strap. Spend a little more and get a better car mount."
1,substandard,"Not a good product! We could never get the battery to work from the start but decided to live with it as we were always going to be plugging it in. We should have taken that as a sign because less than five months later we can't get the unit to turn on at all. Of course now it is too late to return it, so I guess it's garbage."
1,Very Disappointed in this DVD Player,"We've had this dvd player for 6 months. The picture quality isn't great. The worst part of the player is that it only gives you about 3 seconds of notice before the battery dies. Also, you can not charge the battery at the same time you are watching it. I would not recommend this dvd player."
3,battery issues,"At first Audiovox had incorrect information as to spare battery for unit. After shipping me 2 wrong ones, ( I was allowed to return)it was determined the correct ones were due in from overseas the following month. I was traveling and wanted for trip, did not work out. I bought generic battery at local electronics store, just a lot heavier and awkward to travel with."
1,terrible dvd player,I was not satisfied with this product. The first day I received the product it gave me only half and hour of play to the dvd. I charged the battery for 8 hours and still the battery was dead. I again charged the battery for another 8 hours and the player stopped playing before the movie was over. I would not recommend this product.
1,DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY,I thought this would be such a great product for my daughter....loved the package idea. The player stopped working after about 15 uses....over a one month period.I then spent a little more on a Sony player and LOVE IT....no problems. Don't waist your time and money on this cheap product.
5,great gift idea!,"bought this product as a gift for my nephew. He is really enjoying it! Great price for an 8"" screen."
4,nice little package,"This is a great deal. You get the dvd player, 2 headsets, car adapter, a remote and a carrying case. Very good quality from Audiovox. I use this in bed when hubby is asleep and I don't want to wake him but I am not tired yet. It was a little noisy when starting a dvd but then is quiet."
4,very good accounting,I found the description of the effects of the war on the people of Guatemala to be a huge help in allowing me to understand the conditions you see today and the attitudeds of the people I work with.
2,Makes even the simplest concepts confusing,"This book is dull, poorly organized, and ambiguous. The number of errors make you doubt the validity of every statement."
2,Poor grammar guide,"I have a number of stylebooks and grammar handbooks, and until recently I hadn't used this one very much. Now that I've looked up a few things in it, I'm very disappointed with its content. Many of the explanations are too short and vague, and at times I found clear errors. The most recent (and no doubt the very last) thing I looked up was the section on conjunctive adverbs. This handbook states that conjunctive adverbs are also called subordinating conjunctions, and it gave examples and explanations of subordinating conjunctions. That information is absolutely incorrect; although many of the actual words in each category overlap, conjunctive adverbs are not subordinating conjunctions. I can't imagine someone knowledgeable in English grammar making such a flagrant mistake.I wouldn't recommend this handbook to anyone. I'm sure the vast majority of its content is accurate, but there's no point in having a handbook that you can't trust."
4,good resource,"my daughter's tutor loves this resource and it's great to have at home. it really comes in handy. this can be used for older elementary school children, junior high and even high school. in this day and age, everyone could use a little help."
3,Superficial and dull,"I'm one of the 4 percent who ultimately bought this book upon having viewed items similar to it. Trust me, I would've like to belong to another statistic...Most of the information found in this reference is easily findable on the Internet, and what's worst, already well rooted in your brain and fingertips from your first years in school. If you're looking for a guide of advanceD grammar, don't buy this book."
4,Thoroughly entertaining,"Just purchased Pride 32 a few days ago and to my surprise it was better than I thought. The majority of the matches were entertaining(except for Hendo/Belfort). Probably the most entertaining fight was Nakamura vs Travis Gailbraith. There wasn't much technical fighting in this match just a slug it out brawl. The O'haire vs Butterbean match was orginally slated to be Mark Hunt vs Butterbean, but for whatever reason Hunt couldn't compete and O'harie took his place.Some of the reviewers pointed out that this DVD lacked any special features which is true, but what it does have that most pride DVD's don't have are interviews with the winners after their fights. There is also a surprise ring appearance by one of Pride's top fighters. In all I thought this was a pretty good DVD."
5,"The Mentor's Guide - Feb. 20, 2003","This book provides the best definition of a mentor that I have come across thus far with the statement ""...and at there best they inspire us to reach beyond ourselves; they show us how to make a positive difference in a wider world"". It is an easy to read reference tool filled with applicable information about how to prepare for and what to watch for during your journey as a mentor. The author does an excellent job of inspiring a can do attitude by giving the reader the ability to use this book as a workbook to be able to work through real life experiences. This book is a must have for anyone desiring to be in a mentoring relationship."
3,"Ok, but unnecessarily long","I read this book for an adult development class. It's not a bad book, and goes through the process of becoming and being a mentor adequately. But it's too long. If I would condense this book into a version that contained only information and exercises that I thought were necessary, this book would be significantly shorter."
2,no es tan bueno como dicen!,"no crean todo eso, este disco no está tan bueno,es medio depresivo, raro, y no es digno de el maestro.aparte me aburre un poco este disco.los temas son mas o menos buenos, pero no le hacen justicia al flaco spinetta"
5,"LYRICAL, POLITICAL, AND SEXY","This wonderful coming-of-age novel has everything-memorable characters, a great plot, suspense, drama, and humor. . . . LYRICAL, POLITICAL, AND SEXY.""(...)(...)"
2,Disappointed,"I bought these beans hoping they would be good quality, but I was disappointed upon opening the package to see how many broken beans there were and how much dust was at the bottom of each bag.Those which weren't split in the bag came apart during the soaking. This means my cooked beans will look even worseI am used to Greek 'giant limas', which soak to become huge and remain whole in the process. Now I've got a huge quantity of a product I don't want.I was annoyed to see that Amazon will not accept returns for food products, because I think this is really inferior quality."
3,The title is wrong (Cerebrovascular not Cardiovascular),The title in the Amazon.com catalog is wrong.It's Cerebrovascular not Cardiovascular.
2,Needs more songs than 2.,"Most single have at least 3 songs on them, but this one has 2.Pich Me (Remix) wasn't nearly as good as the original."
3,Fun toy but orange rattle is potentially dangerous,"My daughter has been using this ultrasaucer for the past month (she's 5 1/2 mos.) and she really loves it, but I worry about her hurting herself on the orange rattle with the sharp edges. It is supposed to be a jester's hat I guess, but it seems dangerous for a baby's mouth and/or eye. After reading a bunch of these reviews, I can see many parents have indeed had their children either cut their mouths or eyes or even choke on the &quot;fin&quot;like part of the orange rattle. Just be careful. I have been taking it off when she plays - I think I'll keep it off permanently.Also, I think all the toys could have been made a little more baby-friendly (and more interesting), afterall, they know babies just want to put everything in their mouths. Anyway, I'm not overly impressed with this saucer."
5,Very entertaining,"Good product. Nothing bad to say. Our daughter really enjoyed it. Now that she has outgrown it, we've removed the toys and she still loves to play with most of them."
1,not that entertaining,This item is fairly boring and not entertaining at all. It's also hard to operate. In order for the king and queen to play the music you have to hit them really hard. On top of that you can barely hear the music. Not worth all the money.
1,Very Disappointed,"I do not recommend this toy at all. Yes my son was able to jump up and down in it but that is really it. They say it has 22 songs and lights, which is a real rip-off when you see that the lights are as small as tear drops and there are only 7 of them. My husband and I had to look for the lights. The songs are cheap sounding melodies which can barely be heard. The toys may be many, but are not at all stimulating, My son gets very bored of it very quickly. I was really disappointed with this toy and I recommend it to NO ONE. This toy is not mind stimulating to a child and is for too expensive for what you really get. If you have a bouncing baby get him the fisher price bouncing baby chair."
5,Magic Before Your Eyes!,"The day my son turned 4 months old, I put him in this Ultrasaucer. It didn't matter that he couldn't sit up, this Ultrasaucer kept him up. You would have thought he was in heaven by the way his eyes lit up. You could see his brain immediately start working. It was soo cute! He immediately started grabbing, turning, and chewing on the toys. I couldn't believe HOW FAST he could do those things. He was even more excited when he figured out how to make the music start and was enthralled by the lights. Talk about stimulating your baby's brain!! I probably used a roll of film that first time he was in it (yes, he is my first!). He is now 7 months AND STILL LOVES IT!!! It is his favorite place to be and will be over the next several months."
3,unattended? Interesting!,"First off all, I would like to start off saying.. That I see alot of parents on here saying that they LEAVE their child unattended in this product, and many other baby products. BABIES anything, toys, High chairs, etc.. WERE not made to WATCH your baby, they were made to PLEASE them with adult supervision at all times. The only thing SAFE for a baby is their CRIB and only when they are being put to sleep.Not to be rude, read up ladies/gentlemen!This toy has wonderful colours, but is not safe - for supervized and unattended children. There are many toys on there that could hurt your child. If you get it, make sure you watch your child in it, and be sure you watch your child in any toy, Have a great and MERRY CHRISTMAS, the safest to you."
4,not good for your child!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i am a physical therapist who works with pediatric clients. this toy is TERRIBLE for their core muscle strength. they lean forward and are able to stay upright without having to use their core musculature. i highly do NOT recommend this toy!
2,BEWARE THE JESTER,"My son almost lost his eye. He loved to pull the jester down, but what goes down must go up and into his eye. Thanks evenflo once again you prove to be a thoughtless money conscious company."
1,Buy something else!!!,My daughter loved this exersaucer for the first two months then one of the musical items quit working. She really loved the music and now that it does not work she will not sit in it. I e-mail the company and told them of my situation and I was told I could purchase replacement parts. I would not mind buying replacement parts if she would have actually played in it for more than two months. I think for the price the toys should have a longer life!!!! I went and purchased another playcenter for my daughter that takes batteries for the musical items. I would not recommend this item to anyone!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointed Mom,"I bought this stations for my 5 month old daughter and she enjoyed the toys, but the only problem is two of the toys where not functional. The plastic ball kept rolling off and it could of pinched my daughters hand. Also the musical toy that plays 20 songs did not play anything at all. It's also a lot of putting together that you have to do and it's harder taking it apart."
2,VERY UNSTABLE,"I had a problem with another evenflo saucer with my daughter who is 10 months old , getting her leg stuck behind the posts so evenflo sent this as a replacement. IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNSTABLE!!! It sure has alot to keep her occupied but when she bounces and rocks back and forth she has almost tipped over several times. Thank goodness i was right there. Three support legs on the bottom is not enough there should have been four. even her grandfather noticed it wasn't the greatest saucer and we didn't say a thing. now not only am I stuck with one saucer but two."
5,Ultra Exersaucer,"Great product Evenflo has come up with. We bought this product after searching several others we finally bought this one. Our baby girl was 4 months old at the time when we first placed her in the saucer. Even though she could not bounce or touch the bottom, she was so ammused by all the bright colors, toys and sounds. As she grew the saucer grew with her in height and she would love to bounce in it for long periods of time. The longest period of time she spent in her saucer was 1-1 1/2 hours before she would want out. That says alot considering the short attention span babies have at that age. She is too big now for the saucer however when she sees her saucer she still wants to get in, but we have had to graduate to big girl toys. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a saucer that will keep the little minds active and occupied for learning and excercise this is ONE GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
3,Ultrasaucer,"My 5 month old loves this toy now, but it has some minor problems. First, the Jester rattle is dangerous! My boy almost gouged his eye out with it a few too many times so we took it off. Second, the king and queen that are suppose to play 20 songs, end up playing the Muffin Man song 99% of the time. very annoying. Otherwise it holds my son's attention for sometimes an hour at a time...."
4,There are less expensive saucers!!!!,"I received this as a shower gift after registering for it. Don't get me wrong, my son, who is 5 months, really enjoys it but I am not sure that if I were spending my own money that I would purchase the same entertainer. There are less expensive saucers out there that look to me like they have just as many toys and would provide just as much entertainment. With that being said, as far as putting this together and getting it set up it was a snap. I got it put together in less than thirty minutes. The one feature that made me put this on my registry was that the legs fold down for easy storage, which is good when you want to hide it when company comes over."
2,Can be dangerous,"This saucer is wonderful at keeping babies entertained. It is bright and colorful and has plenty of toys on it. However, I do feel the need to warn other parents about a potential danger I witnessed today. My 6 month old son was in the saucer and My mother and I were in the same room with him watching him play. All of the sudden,we saw that his shirt had somehow got caught on the flying dragon toy and the hanger-like attachment the toy is on was getting wrapped around his neck. Immeadiately, I helped him out of the saucer and removed the toy. This is the second danger I have noticed. The first was the orange face toy. My son would always gag on it. Also, his doctor noticed scrapes along the inside of his mouth. After explaining the toy's shape to the him we concluded they were from the toy. I notified Evenflo and they did send a replacement toy. I am seriously considering returning this saucer for the fisher price piano. My son loves this toy but it is not worth his safety."
3,"Fun for baby, but Be Careful","My 4 month old loves this toy.However, be careful of the plastic covers over the springs. These spring covers look like toys to baby and to adults unfamiliar with the product.If twisted the spring comes flying out and could hit baby or adult playing with the toy."
1,Castle pops off and hits baby in the face/wheel pinches hand,"In general, I think the excersaucer is a great idea, however I am returning this model for a different one. Baby's hand can get stuck under the ball (w/little plastic balls for noise inside). Not to mention that the castle (with the rolling wheel) pops off and hits him in the face. He would be playing just fine, and all of the sudden he would start crying like he was hurt. This always happend when the castle came off of the saucer but I never saw what exactly made him cry. I wondered if he was just upset that it came off. I watched him very closely and then I saw it happen. It was horrible. He tried to pull the castle close to put it in his mouth, however it is not a bending piece, so it popped out of its mount and hit him EXTREMELY hard in the mouth. I would not recommend this toy to anyone, unless these two pieces were removed, so you may as well buy a different one!"
5,We love it!,"We bought this because our 4 month old loves standing (with assistance) and is always looking for new ways to entertain himself. After reading the reviews, we decided the Exersaucer sounded perfect. I knew Ethan would enjoy it, but I had no idea he would enjoy it as much as he does! After spending just a few minutes in it, he was bouncing, giggling and squealing. It was love at first sight! He's still getting the hang of spinning, but he loves the toys so much, he's content without spinning! I know he'll enjoy this even more as he gets a little older, since he's just a few days shy of 4 months, but already this is a great investment. We highly recommend this product!"
4,great fun for baby,"This exersaucer is perfect for my child. She keeps entertained with so many textures and colors. The only feature that i don't like is that once the lights and sounds stop, the battery cannot be replaced. Save your money and buy the next step down without lights and sounds."
4,"Great, but short-lived.","The Exersaucer is an easy to assemble product that any new-mom can do. However, since my son is in the 95 percentile (height), the exersaucer excitement was short-lived. Don't be discouraged to buy this product though, as I was extremely happy that the Exersaucer promoted hand-eye coordination and even helped my son learn to stand.I recommend getting it early as soon as your child can hold his/her head steady."
2,better stuff out there,this seemed like a great option but we ended up returning it..its recommended for babies four months and up to 30 inches ..my baby at four months is already 27+ inches its not worth spending that amount of $$ for a 2 or 3 months of use. its too cluttered and the colors are awful. it was difficult to fold down. there are better options to entertain the little ones without paying such a hefty price
2,be careful!!!!,"My 6 mo. old hit her head so hard on the castle the first day that I took it off. Then she hurt her mouth on the jester so off he went too!! Then the final straw came when she almost took out her eye of the tall mirror. The sad part is she loves this toy. the people at evenflo were extremely helpful and they are sending us ""soft"" replacement parts. so if you have trouble contact them."
3,Watch out for the jester,"I have never written a product review before, but I felt an obligation to do so for this product. We absolutely loved this saucer until the orange jester's hat got stuck in our 5-month-old daughter's mouth. While the points on this hat are rounded, they are still designed in a manner that can ""fish hook"" to the inside of our daughter's cheek and get stuck. This incident did not cause any permanent damage, but I would have hoped that all elements of the saucer would have been designed with potential mouth hazards like this in mind. Nevertheless, we have removed the jester completely and continue to enjoy this product."
3,Safety Concern,"This product is indeed a necessity and a great way to stimulate your child. One note of caution: there is a taller plastic piece shaped like a jester's head that has 3 rounded points at its top. My child smacked himself in the eye with it and caused damage and swelling. I intentionally kept this and another taller plastic piece off the exersaucer for over a month until I felt my child could handle himself OK in the saucer. But, within 2 days of placing both those pieces back on the saucer, he had an accident. It could have been worse with severe, permanent eye damage caused... I have now pulled this ""jester"" piece off for good."
3,wonderful toy...be careful of one toy that can be dangerous,I bought this toy for my 5 month old daughter and she loves it! The only thing that I didn't like was the bright orange toy that has a face with beads inside that they can hit and shake. My daughter put this in her mouth and the thin wavy plastic on top of the toy got wedged in her mouth and she could not get it out and it made her choke. All of the other toys on the saucer are fine. I would recommend this saucer to other people because it is nice to have something that you can fold down and take with you but you need to be careful with that paticular toy on this saucer.
3,Couple of problems,"This is a nice Exersaucer. It keeps my 8 month old son entertained. The problem is the ball that you roll. He got his hand stuck under it. The first time it happend he was screaming I didn't know what happend. It took a bit to get his hand out from under it. It was Stuck hard, and his hand was all red. After it happend twice, we had to take the ball off.When he was younger he did hit his head on the king and queen. We had to take that off for a little bit."
3,Buyer Beware,"I received this product as a gift. My 5 month old absolutely loves it. I on the other hand have many concerns with it. Several times, when i have taken my son out of it, his heel has been bleeding. I can't figure out what is cutting it. Also, I don't suggest this product for any child that cannot keep his head up extremely well. The toys on this very hard and can really hurt their bobbing heads."
3,Too many toys,"I really thought this was the best way to go for an exersaucer - so much to occupy her. Now, I realize it is too much and there is a safety hazard. The little castle pops off with just a little force from a little one - my daughter pinched her finger in it. There is definitely a hazard with some of the toys when your little one is not able to fully sit up.All in all, I am not very happy with the purchase. Simply too many things and a little overboard."
1,Its A Very Dangerous Saucer,"We purchased this saucer for my son put it togather and the min he was in it he put the thing on the stick in his mouth and couldnt get out of his mouth and was CHOKING .I couldnt believe it, he was 5 months old so we took it back and got a much simpler one and I dont have to worry any more so watch out for all of those fancy toys on here Please ."
3,great except for one thing,"Our daughter loves spending time in this! But, her little hand got stuck underneath one of the toys. I plan on calling the company on it. She wasn't hurt but it was a little frightening trying to get it out. There's a clear ball that spins with little beads inside. The ball seems to be too low to the tray allowing a tiny hand to get wedged."
5,Buy this exersaucer!,My son loves this product more than any other toy or gadget that we own. It is fairly easy to fold and we take it everywhere. We have not had any problems with the jester.I would definitely recommend this product because my son enjoys it so much and because it is easy to travel with and store.
2,Boring and Sharp,"When I first set it up, I thought it was great. It is really cute, and I thought my son would love it. When it was time to put him in it though, I got really nervous. One of the toys, the tower, is very sharp for an infant to play around. If my son's head jerked back against it, it would hurt him. I removed it and figured I'd put it back in when he was older. Then I started focusing on what he actually had there to play with, which was almost nothing. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned, there are VERY FEW lights, and I can barely hear the quick faint melodies. It is a cute concept, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,Excellent product!!,I bought this for my 7 month old a couple of months ago & he has loved it from the get go! He loves all the bright colors and the fact that he can jump up & down all the time in it!! I HIGHLY Recommend this!!
1,NOT SAFE,I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old. The first time I put him in it he like it. After that he learn to play with all the toys and some of the toys would come back in hit him in the face (almost in his eyes). This was not safe for him at all. I do not to recommend anyone getting this for their baby.
5,Worth the money,"We purchased this ultrasaucer for our 4 month old. She absolutely loves it! At first I thought all of the toys would be a bit overwhelming, but she is able to spin around to see all of the different toys at her leisure. This is a great entertainer. Also. the portability of this saucer--it folds easily and is light weight. This is a great buy and worth the money!!"
3,OK Saucer,OK saucer... the toys come out wen my son pulls on them to chew.. hes 4 1/2 months old and teething so everything goes in his mouth. some of the toys have some tips that could go into his eye so we took those away. He really doesnt like it but will sit in it occasionally. but maybe its just not his thing but I do know some toys can go into their eyes and the toys pop out really easily.
5,My daughter LOVES IT!,"I bought this one before I found out the sex of the baby, figuring it works well with both. My daughter is 7 months now and she absolutely loves it! I really dont know what I would do with out it!"
5,Our baby loves it,"We got this for our baby at about 5 months and he has loved it ever since (almost 9 months old now). Toys come out easily to be de-slimed, lots of things to look at and chew on. He absolutely loves jumping up and down in it, especially to attract our attention (or that of our dog). Songs are not annoying. Takes a little patience to assemble, but overall an excellent toy. Theme is cute as well."
1,SAFETY CONCERN!!,My son nearly poked his eye out with the longer toy that is attached (the rattle with an orange pointed platic top. He was able to pull the toy out and hit himself with the plastic rattle right under his eye. He's only 5 months old. He had a large bruise right under his eye and also sweeling. This should be recalled or they should stop putting this toy on the saucer!
1,Dangerous,I recieved this for a baby shower gift. I was so excited it looks like a lot of fun. Well my neice happens to have this and recently cut her head and was bleeding pretty badly. She cut it on the castle. She also had problems getting a peice stuck in her mouth!!!! To many sharp peices for a baby toy. What were they thinking. Needless to say I returned mine and purchased another kind.
3,Seriously mixed feelings,"We got this exersaucer when our daughter was 5 mo old to keep her upright because one side of her head had flattened from lying on her back so much. But then her physical therapist told us not to use it until she was 7 or 8 months old b/c for babies with torticollis (neck problems), it causes them to put strain on/use muscles that cause more problems (the way they balance/turn/etc in the saucer). Too bad, b/c she loved it. So we used it again at 7.5 months and she still liked it, but now she's stronger and she managed to pull the castle off and hit herself, cutting her mouth! There's nothing like seeing your 8 month old bleeding! Now I'm scared to put her in it unless I'm watching her (even though I left the castle off), in which case I might as well just play with her on the floor."
3,Saftey Issues,My 6 month old daughter choked when she got the orange jester stuck in her mouth. Since this event I have removed the jester and the saucer is fine. The jester is a thin but hard plastic piece and once she got it into her mouth she couldn't get it out on her own. I would recommend that if you buy or own this saucer to remove the jester.Other than that my daughter is entertained in the saucer by all the other items.
5,Great Saucer,"I bought this saucer for my son a couple of months ago. He would always want to be held sitting up and this allowed him to do that while I had a little free time to tend to my older son or even get a few things done. Now that my son is 6 months old he loves this saucer. There are so many things for him to do on it. I believe his favorite toy is the orange one with the fin looking thing on top. I read some of the other reviews about how the children would stick it way back in their mouths and choke on it, but so far I haven't had a problem with that, and this toy is almost constantly in my son's mouth. I had a megasaucer with my first son and loved it, but this one is so much better just because it has a little more variety of toys on it and it folds up so you can bring it with you. I would definitely recommend this toy."
3,Satisfactory,"I put my 5 month old baby in this activity center and he immediately started to play with all the various activities. There are a few toys that seem a little dangerous since they have hard edges that your baby can fall onto since they don't completely have their heads stable yet. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with the 15 minutes I get from putting him in the chair. That's usually the attention span of babies anyways."
2,Paint peels off,My husband and I purchased the ultrasaucer last weekend. The baby loved all of the toys but after a day we noticed that he could peel the paint off of the clear domes that cover the legs. This is an obvious safety hazard. We returned it immediately and went back to the megasaucer.
5,The best saucer out there!,"I had this saucer on my registry and got it at my baby shower. I absolutly loved it. I couldn't wait for my son to be old enough to use it (4 months). He is 10 months now and still plays in it for hours. It adjusted to his height as he grew. It's made very sturdy, I've had no problems with it. It is easy to clean and keep clean. My son is very strong and active and has never been able to tip it over or break any of the toys on it. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Our baby has loved this for 6 months now!,"We received the Ultrasaucer as a shower gift and introduced Andrew to it at about 4 months old. He LOVED it then and he still loves it now at 10 months. He is mobile now so he doesn't want to actually sit in the seat but he cruises around it playing with the toys for up to 30 minutes at a time! He also loves to crawl underneath the seat and look out like it's his own private clubhouse. (It is sooo cute!) This toy has provided lots of entertainment for him in so many ways! It's not a necessity, we could get along without it but I'm so glad we don't have to!"
1,Flag danger!!,"The soft flag can be pulled of the flag pole leaving a sharp point that a baby could hurt themselves on (eye level or chewing/choking level). My 6 month old (premature) daughter managed to get it off just by chewing and playing with it. I received this toy as a gift and now wish that I had not. It is not a baby-friendly toy, rather it is downright dangerous. Evenflo said, yeah it was defective. No duh! How poorly made must it be if a 6 month old can break it so easily? I wish I could give it less than 1 star."
3,Overstimulation,"I registered for this product because it was voted ""best"" in many toy reviews. It does have many interesting features but my son is overstimulated by many of the toys. I have even removed several of them to decrease the stimulation but he still gets irritated after a short time. The springs even have multi-colored covers that add stimulation but actually DO nothing. Looking back, I would have bought a much cheaper saucer and simply placed different toys on the table to vary the 'scenery'. Waste of money."
4,this was a disaster,"My 7 month old daughter hated this toy! The first time we put her in it, she howled her head and it just went downhill from there. We kept it for a couple of weeks to see if she would warm up to it. Eventually she would only need to see it to start crying. Be smart and see if your baby likes this in the store before you go through the considerable assembly hassle only to have to dismantle it and cram it back in the box."
4,great fun but hard to clean,"My son loved this toy from 4 months on up. Now my nephew enjoys it. It is durable and easy to use, fold up and pack away. The seat comes out for easy cleaning. However, some of the toys on top are fabric and this makes them nearly impossible to clean. We threw the pennant away because the recommended surface cleaning did nothing to remove what we took for mold growing due to constant teething. Even the clothes washer and dishwasher, (for higher temps), did nothing to clean it. Other than having fabric pieces that are unable to be salvaged once dirty, I highly recommend this product."
2,not for teething,my little one loved to put all the plastic toys and accessories in her mouth and they are little and hard to manipulate. I prefer one that has soft objects to play with- this seems dangerous!
4,Beginning to walk...what will I do,"We bought the ultrasaucer for our son when he was 4 months old. He loved it then and still loves it now (one yr old). He recently managed to crawl out of it and we know we have to put it away. What will we do?! This has been such a source of entertainment for our son for most of his life! He would spend hours in it if we let him. Now, he pulls up on it from the floor and walks all around it playing with the toys. One tiny complaint...the castle toy. We had to take it off due to the fact that he kept banging his face on it and getting hurt. So he has used it without the castle and I honestly don't know what we will do now that he is too old for it. It's the best toy so far."
3,Mostly Pleased,"This is a great entertainer, however, one should consider this: my son is 6 months old, and in the 95% for his height (28.5 inches). He is on the third and heightest height adjustment, and his toes are more than just touching. The warning lable says not to have your childs feet flat on the bottom. I worry that he may only get a couple months use out of this because he will be too tall.This has so many toys, which is great for them not to get bored, but my son seems to become overwhelmed and not able to focus on one toy. So if you child is average height, I wouldn't think twice about it purchasing it."
3,His Hands gets Stuck,"My son loves his exersaucer - he loves to jump up and down. However, his chubby hands get caught under the plastic dragon ball with the beads. It gets jammed in there pretty good then he gets scared and cries. I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself. It gets really stuck under the ball and sometimes it takes me a couple of minutes to get it out. I put a bib in that area, so his hand can't slip down there anymore. I love the toy, but would recommend the safari version (which comes without that dragon ball)."
3,If your child is tall you might not want this.,"I purchased this for my daughter when she was 5.5 months old. It said it recommended the saucer for ages up to 1 year. Well, that's swell and all, but the instructions specifically say to not use the saucer if your child is over 30"" tall. By the time I got this, I had to use the 3rd notch. I'll probably just get a couple month's use out of it.I'm sure you could 'risk' it, but it's not worth the chance to me. I would hate to not pay attention because I was making dinner to find out that she could get out ot get hurt.She seems to enjoy it, but not as much as her jumperoo. Nevertheless, it does keep her amused for small stretches of time and for that alone, it was worth it."
2,Waste of money,"If you have an active child who does not like to be confined, the this item is not for you. I bought it when my son was four months old. He is sixteen months now and has used this toy a total of 30 minutes. The toys are not very entertaining and can poke your child in the eye. It might make a good toy for a quiet child who is content to sit and play by themselves."
4,A great help,"We borrowed this from a friend to try it out. My 6 month old loves it and has been playing in it happily for the last 2 months. I bring him to work with me, and it gives him an entertaining and safe place to be while I'm working. He has never been hurt by any of the pieces, nor has he pulled them off (as I've heard other parents complain about). The music is nice- enough to entertain him but not loud and obnxious for the adults around it. The ""lights"" are over-rated, but overall we really like this toy!"
4,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"I like everything about this saucer. My 8-month old loves it. If I had one complaint it would be that it is hard for my child to bounce in it (she's on the small-side for her age) because the springs are very stiff and wont bounce unless there is signifigant force applied. Otherwise, it's great... I like that it folds up, and my child likes the number and variety of toys, and it keeps her happy while I clean the kitchen."
4,"overall, very good investment, but not really so ""foldable""","Had an ""ultra"" Evenflo exersaucer for my son 6 years ago and this one definitely beats the older model in all areas! My daughter loves it and has been enjoying it since she was 4 months old (she's now 6 months). It was relatively easy to put together, although it did take about 30 minutes. I love that the toys around the saucer are very simple for an adult to take out (and therefore wash). Also there is a good mix of chew toys, sound toys and spinning toys. None of the toys are very loud either..big plus! One complaint though... it is seriously a huge pain to get this thing to fold! I have accomplished it only twice and both times have majorly pinched my finger! Luckily, I have a van, so i don't really have to fold it when bringing it to grandma's house. For most parents, I think their kids will like this toy enough to where they will want to take it with them whether it folds or not!"
5,My Daughter loves bouncing all day!,"Bought the ultra saucer after reading reviews on all of the brands. My husband insisted on the ultra, because he thought the mega saucer was ugly! My duaghter loves it and has a ball bouncing around. I wish I had bought it a little earlier than I did, though. My daughter is now 6 1/2 months old, and the toy is already on the third. I love how easy it is to break the toy down. It is very light - I should know, I carry it to my in-laws everyday. I do have two problems with the toy. I wish they had made it so I could get the flag off. My daughter soaks the flag w/ drool and it is difficult to clean up. The rattle also gets drool in it. I found the best solution to cleaning the rattle was hot water and soap, and then a hair dryer to dry it. I still really love the saucer though!"
3,SO annoying to assemble!,I am sure this is great once it is together. I know my friend's kids love it. But this is the most annoying thing I have every assembled. Fisher Price products are SO MUCH EASIER. Everything just snaps in. I just broke one piece trying to remove it once I put it in wrong. I have never seen anything like this. And the thing collapses - I do not understand why some of these hard parts with the springs could not have come pre-assembled.
4,Great Toy!,"My 7 month old daughter just loves to play in it.She jumps,rocks and bounces in the saucer while chewing on each and every toy.Though she loves to chew on every toy I find some toys for example the horse one and another orange one are not very safe.I have removed those toys.This toy has 3 height adjustments and the seat rotates so that baby can play with each toy.Assembly is not very hard .This toy certainly gives me some free time :)"
3,Choking problems,"This product has a choking hazard on it. I say remove it immediately.Just like some of the others have stated before me. My daughter got the orange face thing with the balls in it wedged in her mouth. It started to make her choke and then vomit, of course the vomit had no where to go but back down and she started choking more luckily I was there.My daughter likes the toy otherwise and it is very cute but I would take that off that's one scare no one should have to go through."
2,Not Entertaining,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 month old son and returned it the next day. It is very bright and colorful and that is the only nice thing I can say. The only toy my son would play with was the frog. None of the toys moved, they were not eye catching, you could barely hear the music, and once the batteries die.....that's it. YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERIES! This toy is not entertaining."
4,very pleased,"I have to thank my cousin Dianne and her husband for buying this item for me...it is to say the least very entertaining. It was also very easy to put together. Being a first time mom, I was surprised to see that the legs adjusted for baby's height.The product also seems very sturdy. I am glad my friend Monica suggested this item to me."
5,must buy,After researching exersaucers online I decided on this one because of the great reviews.It is definitely worth the high price tag. My son loves all the toys. The toys that play music are not too loud; which is great so they don't startle my son when he taps them.I found it very easy to assemble. I completed it in 30 mins.
3,Complicated Assembly,"I bought this toy for my son (5 months old) and the first thing I noticed when I was putting it together was that there was a lot of parts! Also, they included the wrong size screws and it was difficult to ""make"" them fit. Otherwise, my son loves it. I can see why someone might say that the toys are mildly hazardous.. if I had to go and do it over again, I might have bought a different model - although I thought this one was the most stable one.."
3,Fun but not safe,"I purchased this toy approximately 2 weeks ago and my son loves it, as he is currently 6 months old and loves to put things in his mouth. The downfall however, was when he grabbed hold of the rattle attachment (with the fin looking things on top) and stuffed it in his mouth. He managed to stuff it so far back into his mouth that he choked and vomitted all over the saucer. Luckily both parent were in the room with him to remove it from his mouth. I think the toy offers lots of activy, but he mobile attachments may need to be re-thought.Solution: We removed the attachment from the table top to prevent further choking hazards."
5,Best Toy Ever,"Well, we finally broke down and spent the money on this toy. Good timing too, since this portable version is brand new. I've looked at the old one and this one is far superior, more toys, more convenience for parents. My 5.5 month old daughter loves this toy. She can put just about every toy in her mouth, she loves the two music boxes on it and it keeps her amused for almost an hour. For a baby who takes 30 minute naps, this is a godsend! I recommend this to all parents who have a baby around 4 months and up. I wish we'd done it sooner."
3,Not for all babies!,"We bought this for our son when he was 4 months, and he hated it. He wouldn't even sit it in without crying. We felt we had wasted $80 and thought about trying to sell it. Every once in a while we would bring it out again and see if he showed any interest. Finally at 7 months he decided it was okay to play with. I wish I had tested it out with him in the store before buying it to make sure he liked it. Even at 7 months he prefers sitting and playing on the floor or his doorway jumper to the entertainer. I think parents should be wary of buying this product online without doing a ""test drive"" first. The money could be better spent elsewhere."
3,okay,kinda short had to modify but fits even though i didnt pass although i dont thinks its the sensor. all in all its good
3,Passed Inspection but....,I bought this and had to cut the wiring and used original socket because it did not fit before cat. Engine=>OXSensor==>CAT==>OXSensor===>SilencerMy 1999 4Runner had different socket for both sensors. Any how that sensor worked and passed my inspection and increase fuel millage. Two weeks later sensor was shot and no voltage detected and engine light came back again.
5,sensor,just a oxygen sensor for my 4runner.It came in fast and easy to install with the right tools.Everything seems to be working.
5,Great deal amazon!,"Wow, amazon just destroys the competition. They are really crushing the local auto parts store. Combined with free shipping thru prime, you can't lose.I bought these after my catalytic converter got stolen. I bought a used one from a junk yard, but my car was throwing off errors. The errors led me to believe I had to replece the O2 sensors. Replacing these fixed the problems.make sure you get both the intake and exhaust sensors."
3,A lot of content for very little scratch,"This set offers 17 hours of ""classic Horror"" for a minimal investment. The movies and shows are all packed on to 2 double sided disks, I didn't expect much from this set, but was surprised to find the quality of the prints are half way decent and watchable, not great, but for the price I'm quite satisfied."
2,Now 10 years old and out of date.,"Publisher: Free Press; (May 6, 1994)I bought this back years ago and it was one of the best of the time when it was written. It is a little dry...written scholar to scholar, not for consumers or even families in my opinion.But its now totally out out date with regards to new antipsychotics as it only mentiones Clozaril and Risperdal. Missing Seroquel, Zyprexa, Geodon, Abilify and plenty more now being tested!Look at recommendations for another...this is past its prime."
1,A hole you could drive a truck through . . .,"An otherwise charming romance that is nearly ruined by the author's misunderstanding of the British parliamentary system. As another reviewer mentioned, our hero is a Lord, and as such would be in the House of Lords by right, not in the House of Commons subject to election. If this was just an issue of some sloppy historical research on a side issue, I could ignore it, but since his political future was given as the main objection to his romance with governess Lucy, it was too irritating to ignore. Correct the error and the plot dissolves.Very disappointing. Where was the editor in this whole process? It seems this obvious a slip should have been caught early on."
5,Jim Robinson,"I have had this album since it came out in 1972, I actully took this album to ghost town of Caliico...set my portable record player on a table, put it on and looked at what I was hearing....ya thats it."
4,What Zinn did for AmHist; Takaki does for WWII,"The story u dont here from Brokaw. Takaki, a third generation American of Japanese heritage and Berkeley prof, teaches that no one ever made a film about the race riots that occurred during WWII, you never hear about the Mexican Americans who harvested crops to supply the troops. You never hear speeches about the Jim Crow rules, the Navajo, black, Korean, Filipino, Indian, German, Japanese, and other Americans during the great War. This book fills in the gaps, with stories about Korean Americans who fought (one fifth of Los Angeles' Korean population joined the California National Guard) in the Tiger Brigade/Manghokun, the Sikhs and Hindus duing WWII, the 550,000 Jewish Americans who joined the US Armed Forces and earned 26,000 Purple hearts (out of 4.5 Million american Jews, they were proportionately more than any other group), the African Americans who liberated Buchenwald, and the Nisei Japanese American soldiers who liberated Dachau, and more"
4,"Great hitch, wrong hitch pin.","I purchased this hitch to put on my 2003 Honda Rincon 650. I needed to hitch up a large utility dumping trailor to do some landcape work on my property. Only issue I had was that the hitch pin that cam with the trailor was too large for the single pin hole, and obveously the ball slot was way too big. The fix was to use a galvenized bolt left over from my chainlink project. Worked in a pinch and luckily it didn't even as much as scratch the hitch. I'll take the time to modify the plate when I have access to a drill press, but that won't be a huge deal. If you want a perfect fit for your quad, hardware included, this will work."
3,Turkey is smooth with the rough guide,"As always with the rough guide series, it hits the mark. What you need to know and points in the right direction for adventure."
2,Disappointing,"Having purchased nearly every ballpark book in existence, I have to say that this one falls short of the mark. The author, evidently a Dodger fan, (pages and pages on Dodger Stadium and Ebbets field) gives scant information on many of the parks with some really poor pictures, when pictures are provided at all. For example, the author never shows an interior picture of the new Miller Park. There are much better books dealing with ballparks - skip this one, its not worth the money."
5,It was a gift excitingly rec'vd!!,I actually did read about several of the ball parks before I gave this book to my brother-in-law!! He loved getting it and actually started reading before we left our Christmas gathering.
5,Funny short stories... An easy read!,"The stories are short (mostly a page and a half to two pages in length) which makes them easy to read; they tell of everyday happenings with hilarious results. I can easily relate to these tales, which just makes them just that much funnier; especially since the author says what we all know that we are thinking. :)This is a great book for anyone! I highly recommend it!"
1,"lost, stolen, who knwos","I never received my item, although it was delivered, maybe to the wrong house. still waiting for an answer from the seller and Amazon.com to solve this issue."
2,Not Helpful.,"I have to disagree with the first reviewer on this book. I have never been disappointed enough by a book to write a negative review - until now. I took the GRE a few months ago. I found the best study to be actual, past GRE exams. I honestly do not recall seeing a single word from this book or the other WordSmart book (which had a GRE Hit Parade) on the actual exam. I made notecards and put alot of time into learning these words and feel that it was not a valuable use of my time."
2,Did not see any on the exam,I have to agree that words used in word smart series are not often seen on GRE tests themselves. I made tons of note cards and i did not see even one from my extended note card collection.
2,No pude terminar de leerlo,"Me considero una lectora cumplida, pero con este libro no pude. Obscuro, complicado, retorcido desde un principio. TAl vez Donoso sea genial, segun dicen por ahi, pero a mi el libro no me engancho, no me gusto, me aburrio, fue un plomo leer las primeras 100 paginas y no entendi nada."
2,poor quality control,"junk. returned it. There's not much to building a cable...this one degraded the signal significantly. ended up using a Gefen cat5 extender, which works perfectly."
5,Great pack!!!,I did lot's of research on finding a lightweight pack with a large bladder. I used this pack for a two day 40 mile that I did and it was fantastic. I was able to keep my sunblock and lots of other items that I needed tucked away and still easily accessible while walking. I love my pack.
3,Won't Power a 105watt TV.,"This product is ok. Not enough power is the only complaint. The fan is not loud at all, actually when I was using it, it never came on. This was for the RV and it wouldn't power up a 105watt TV, it kept on flashing red and green. I tried it with a 45watt TV and worked. It just doesn't have the power it advertises."
3,it was...ookaay...,"its not thaatt cool... i mean, its kong, but its not as good as the movie game. if your going to buy the movie version of the game, buy it for a game console or PC. the gameboy version isnt as good and doesnt have the same excitment and feeling!"
4,"Good 17"" HP laptop case","This is a good quality case for LARGE 17"" laptops.I recently bought a HP Pavilion dv8380us ""entertainment"" laptop.A reasonably priced case was difficult to find.The HP is BIG but fits nicely with all it's add-ons in the TED002 Targus case with it ""expanded"".A good buy at the $40 price."
1,Locking mechanism very poor quality,"When it arrived, the metal tabs in the lid did not properly line up with the catches in the locks, but they were awkward to realign. Then, the buttons you press in the locks would stick, sometimes in weird positions. Could've been a good case if they'd not been so haphazard about the locks. Mine was quite unusable. A total waste of money."
2,"chintzy, but cheap","I got this for $40 from Tiger Direct through Amazon. In real life, it looks very chintzy, like I should store my Transformers in it. But who can complain for only 40 bucks."
3,Be prepared for assembly!,"None of this arbor is assembled. You will be putting together the lattice work. You will have to make sure things are parallel,and the slats are evenly spaced. The little brad-like nails come out of the soft cedar easily, so try to use a staple gun. For almost $250, I would've like more than just a bunch of pieces of wood."
4,Fascinating Remembrances,"If you were a seven or eight year old (thereabouts) in the early 1950s this book will transport you back to a simpler time. A time when boys played in the creeks and invented games to stay occupied. A time when a ""growed up"" boy could head out early on a summer morning from home and not get back till supper...and so much more. O yea, you'll love this book."
5,be frank,Got it as a gift for my husband and he loved reading it. It only took a few days since her never put it down. He says he will read it in the future again.
5,True and genuine outdoor literature - this book is a heartwarmer,"Reading this book is pure enjoyment. Much more than a outdoor book, it manages to give to the reader true wisdom and even practical advice.Highly recommended."
1,Repeating the same message,"Imagine a walk in the woods with your Grandfather and all the stories you would hear about the past, and all those lessons he would teach you. Now, times that by 28 chapters and you have the flavor of The Old Man and the Boy. There are so many descriptions and details in the novel that at times it feels almost as if you are right there next to the boy. But while the novel was peaceful and stimulating at first, after awhile - with no plot change - it got old. Even with the novel's noteworthy teachings, I wouldn't read it again because it never managed to keep my attention. At times, it just dragged."
5,The Old Man and the Boy,"Ruark's book conjures up memories of my own Old Man. The same guidelines on handling guns and how to shoot are still valid today. Some of the more important parts of this book deal with just going hunting, fishing , etc. not with the results of the day, but why we go do these things. Learn why fishing isn't about catching fish. Learn why some dogs are made to hunt and some aren't. The last chapter ""All He Left Me Was The World"", is not to be read by the tenderhearted. It strikes a chord with any of us who have lost our Old Man. I too went hunting the day of the Old Man's funeral, I know that's what he would have wanted, and so does Ruark."
4,Something for everyone,"If you love to hunt or fish or enjoy the outdoors, this book will be very appealing for you. And even if your favorite hobby is indoors, you will still enjoy this book. The book focuses a lot on outdoor activities, but it still has a little bit of intrigue for every reader. For the outdoorsy readers, this book focuses on hunting and fishing and may bring back memories of your previous adventures. For the other readers, this book has many subtle messages. This novel has an abundance of life lessons that you can make much use of in your life. So whoever you are and whatever you enjoy doing, I recommend that you read this book."
4,Pheasants and Philosophers,"Point: A philosopher is born next to a pond.Path: A grandfather passes on the wisdom of life to his grandson through fishing, hunting, and time outdoors. The boy learns life's major lessons from a caring old man who desires his progeny to be ready and useful in the world.Sources: A thorough understanding of the great outdoors, and all that goes into a genuine sportsman.Agreement: I found this to be both a humorous and thoughtful book. The wisdom of the old man made me remember key old men in my life and what they taught me through walks in this world.Disagreement: The old man can be cantankerous at times, and uses the language suited for his demeanor. I also would disagree with his view of religion.Personal App: Am I listening to the Old Men in my life?Favorite Quote: ""You can't pour a gallon of knowledge into a one-quart brain."""
2,This Tomb should have remained Undiscovered.,"The combination of overdubbed Chinese language on Japanese actors, coupled with an implausible story line, terrible computer graphics and miserable ending, created a life event that will never be regained."
2,an outdated hitchcock tribute,"i agree with some of the reviews about it being a tribute to hitchcock and rear window. but, man, this is outdated. the shock value isn't there anymore. hitchcock implied it, while de palma shows it, and it doesn't hold up. the soundtrack is great. the movie, i feel, tries to balance between horror and some light humor and that does not pan out either. margot kidder is good, but the rest of the acting is fair. best line in the movie is when a woman yells about being institutionalized because of germs coming through her phone.about the criterion edition. i have about seven criterion releases. i find them over rated and way, way overpriced. this is not worth the price. you don't get much for bonus materials. does anyone really READ interviews on your tv? by far the best company on the market is anchor bay, or blue underground. great prints and extras. don't like my review? check out the number of used dvds there are. i rest my case."
1,This was the epitome of a dumb movie,"and I want my coupon back!OMG! I sat through this movie hoping that it would get better! I nodded off twice and should've remained asleep!This is NOT a horror movie.. it's more like a dull comedy wannabe Hitchcock thriller!as stated previously, I'm mad and I want my coupon back!"
1,So Bad You Will Want to Share,"I couldn't take my eyes off this piece of garbage. It is so truly awful you will want to share it with friends. Funny, campy, awkward in the extreme does not begin to describe the movie and why it is not a cult classic I do not know."
2,A breach birth,"Although not De Palma's first work, it certainly rates as his worst. Perhaps he was clearing his throat before ""Carrie.""The production quality makes its television contemporaries ""Streets of San Francisco"" and ""Police Woman"" look and sound utterly slick by comparison. Margot Kidder's attempt at a French Canadian accent is laughably bad. The plot twists are implausible. (How do you clean gallons of blood from a snow-white carpet and couch in 5 minutes?) The ""shocking"" ending is trite and predictable from the first ten minutes of this mess. And De Palma must have been the ONLY person in this country still describing people as ""colored"" in 1973, a full two years after ""Shaft.""Fast forward to the bit parts played by Olympia Dukakis, Barnard Hughes, and Charles Durning and skip the rest."
5,WORTH ADDING TO YOUR MOVIE COLLECTION!,"This film is fabulously sick. Although the film was influenced by other great films (Rear Window / Psycho), it has that De Palmer edge that keeps you wondering and totally entertained. They don't make movies like this anymore. Kudos to Margot Kidder!"
5,Originality and that fine line,"Everyone seems to want to talk about the Directors feel in the film close to Hitchcock. The films made and frankly no one here has room to be so crictical. Frankly, the film stands very well on it's own and in this review, we'll focus on that. However, as a guideline if you like Hitchcock and are not so caty as other Hitchcock fans, you'll love this picture.My obsession with siamese twins began shortly after seeing the film. Although the extras are not over bundant as other Crit col. films, the restoration is an art to it's own. Sisters, cuts through the red tape or should I say the flesh. Was there a murder? What happened through that window? You'll have to see this to find out. Although not my favorite type of Horror/suspence.... it was a terrific watch and a definate change from the hollywood garbage that has been made the past years for horror. A+ A must see. I will not give away this films high points you have to see it."
4,Great Movie,"I bought this film, because Bernhard Herrmann wrote the music for it. (He wrote the music for many other thrillers like North By Northwest, Psycho, Vertigo, Cape fear and many others too.)And I just can say that's really a great movie!!A real 'homage' to Alfred Hitchcock!!Sound and Picture is o.k. for a film of that age. It would have been nice, if more bonus material would be on the DVD.But most import: It's a really thrilling movie one will not forget!"
4,Entertaining Early De Palma,"Fans of Brian De Palma's later movies, such as ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed to Kill,"" will probably really enjoy this lesser known film. Margot Kidder, in one of her first major movie roles, plays Danielle and Dominique - French Canadian siamese twins that were surgically separated. One the twins may have committed a murder witnessed by Jennifer Salt, who plays a small-time newspaper journalist. Salt tries to solve this murder and ends up embroiled in the case.Fans of 70's movies may know the background of this pair...Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt were best friends and roommates. They rented a beach house where many 70s luminaries gathered, including De Palma, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas. Seeing them together in a movie may thus have special appeal to people (such as myself) who love 70s movies.The movie is somewhat gory, but really held my interest. The story is ultimately somehwat silly, but that's true of most De Palma thrillers. Overall, highly recommended."
2,Chihuly Gerden and Glass,"As I have now realized there are two books with the same title. The photography in this edition is of very poor quality.. Dark, difficult to truly appreciate what should be distinct, captivating form and colors of glass art.Very disappointing. Would return if not for the fact it was meant to be a special gift."
3,Intigueing,This series was the ultimate Flashback story line seldom have writers done flash backs so well and to do so consistently never the storyline is standard SciFi but well told ans solid acting make this series memerable
5,The best SciFi in years.,"What a great series, but what a shame it has been canceled after just one season. Like one of the other reviewers said, I don't normally buy box sets, but I will be pre-ordering this one. The programme is original, well scripted with a compelling story and excellent production values. Lets just hope that another network picks it up some time in future. Maybe if the DVD sales are good it'll be revived for the abyss."
5,Great Show!,"I caught most of the episodes when they were aired and thought this was a great series. I really can't understand why shows like this are considered canceled and reality shows go on for season after season. I'm hoping that someone might at least pick up story and do a series of books to finish out the story.The only real negative for this series dvd set, it that it ends just as things get really interesting - sort of how the Firefly series did."
2,Defying Gravity,"This is one of the best TV series I have seen. Each character is developed over the whole season of episodes and each engages the viewer into the story. The plot is somewhat fanciful, but interesting. The videography is outstanding and, while spectacular, does not overwhelm the storyline. It is a shame that there was only one season for this series."
2,A Promising Premise Botched,"A series about interplanetary exploration, in the right hands, would have been a sure fire winner. Unfortunately the people producing this series knew nothing about space travel, imagining the near future, or indeed writing, directing, or acting. It was a sad waste."
1,Zero Stars -- But Five Well-Merited Yawns!,"After watching this soapy, relationship-entangled space opera for five endless hours, I happened to glance at my watch to notice that only five minutes had passed.Award yourself the ""Purple Heart For Patience"" if (like myself) you somehow manage to stick with this turkey to its distant, disapopinting conclusion, for the purpose of finally discovering the nature of its...""UNIMAGINABLE MYSTERY,"" which the creators of the series -- from one grueling episode to another -- keep dangling enticingly before you.Perhaps the one and only redeeming feature about DEFYING GRAVITY is the immense sense of gratification and relief -- and ""lightness"" -- you're likely to experience after recommending it to (i.e., inflicting it on) your worst enemy."
1,defying logic - another good show cancelled,"I thought this was a great show. I liked most of the characters and it had a couple of my favorite actors. Let's see..future...science...space...mystery...and beautiful women! What's not to like?However, it was a little slow at times, dragging out the mystery of the ship across so many weeks just annoyed rather than make me anticipate the next episode. Plus, I am not a big fan of flashbacks if overused.It give it one star because I don't believe in rewarding the networks for their shortsightedness."
1,Incomplete Season 1 After Cancellation,Title says it all. A good TV show canceled. I am sure most people will buy it. Rewarding a network for canceling a interesting series half-way through its run at 13 episodes.Utter junk.A sheeple purchase when you can download for free online.
4,Affordable superlight tire with good performance,"These came stock on my Cervelo R3 SL, and I've put about 250 miles on them. They corner very well and make the bike feel even lighter. My only criticism is an occasional where's-the-wheel feeling I get on fast level sprints in the saddle. Everything else (45 mph descents, long climbs, steady riding) has felt great. It's worth taking some grams off the rim to ride these, and from other review sources, I expect them to last long enough to use as training tires (not sure I'd race them)."
2,did not serve me,"Disappointing - lacks history, good and comprehensive graphics, in-depth explanations. Wish that I could have looked inside before I purchased."
2,Why Oh Why???,"I have heard bootlegs that sound crisper, cleaner and acoustically more sensitive. Of all their live performances over the years, why did they choose this release?The sound is muddy, (almost sounds like a bootleg recording in the crowd), has no real highlight and misses the mark for the Jan and Dean Fan!!! Save your money and hope that somewhere in the J&D; archives that there awaits a true gem rather than this non essential release!!!!"
4,pretty good,"Well, I enjoyed reading this book. Though why is Parker putting on a WESTERN saddle on a horse that looks like Star? Parker had to make some pretty tough choices in here, but in the end it all worked out for the best. Wow, imagine having an oppourtunity to own two horses with Olympic caliber and having to turn it down."
3,Not the best...,"I am not overly fond of the Parker books as it is and this one was a prime example of why that is. It has none of the elements that make this series what it is. Parker's character is inconsistant, Brad's predicatable. The Brushes With Fame cliche was annoying. I mean, Welton Romance? *coughs*Anyway, for diehard collectors of the series only! Don't read this if you are looking for a true tase of the series. I reccomend the orginal books by Joanna Campbell. (1-14)Besides the fact that I wasn't overly pleased with this book, I will still buy them! Please don't stop this series. It's been a constant part of my life for 11 years! visit forum.whitebrookfarm.com if you'd like to help us save the TB series!"
3,it was ok,"This book was okay, but I found it sort of boring. I mean it was all about Parker really. The reason I read these books is because they're suppose to be about horses... NOT people. Anyhow I did not care for this book, but I would recommend it to collecter's of these books and for others as well because we all have different oppinions.P.S. I would also recommend the Phantom Stallion books by Terri Farley. They ride western though.. so I know some people won't like that, but you might want to try them just the same"
4,the bare wench project,"I found this movie to be both exciting and funny the essence of the sexuality was unbelievable during this ploy of the blair witch project, a must see and own movie for years of entertainment"
1,not happy,I downloaded this for my husband and it seems to be missing pages or something.The story jumps from one page to another and does not make much sense at all.Have never had this problem before.thanks Sue
4,Thank God wild places still exist,"Australian farmer Michael Keenan hits hard times on his farm in New South Wales and heads off to western Queensland with his cattle. A grand tale of life on the land, horses, cattle and people who live a life so different from our comfortable city existance. I loved this book for its earthy hardships and at one point its gripping high drama, Michaels persicution by 'the wild bunch'. A great read by a first time author that left me pleased there are still places in modern day Australia untouched by popular culture."
2,Not very fun to listen to.,I listened to this cd awhile ago and then i listened to it after i bought grits (art of translation) FTF (fireproof) and many other cds and this lg wise just doesnt appeal to me. I got a headache after listening to We salute and other songs. I dont know how his other cds are but they have to be better than this.
2,HK91 Buffer,"The HK91 recoil buffer wasn't too difficult to install, I needed a longer bolt than stock in one position. At the range I did experience some problems, the first round would chamber slowly and oftentimes not fire, I had to remove the magazine and eject the live round, this happened with almost every mag I used. I am going to remove the buffer as this was too much of a problem for the slight reduction in recoil."
5,Great Book!!!!!,This is a great Book! This book is perfect for my 3rd grade classroom. My students really liked this book.
2,The same as any other dark roast k-cup,"I drink a lot of k-cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors. I would compare the Kona k-cups to just about any other k-cup that's medium or dark roast. It's a decent flavor, but a huge disappointment because I was overly optimistic that it would taste closer to real kona that is fresh brewed a more traditional way.If you aren't expecting too much, this is a decent cup of coffee. If you want anything close to authentic kona taste, you need fresh beans and not freeze-dried plastic cups. If your only experience with kona is this stuff, you're missing out on a great cup of coffee at a decent price."
5,My most favorite coffee Great flavor no acid taste,I am so sorry to hear that the Tully's Kona blend will not be available due to the drought conditions in HI and that they will be doing a replacement blend with different polynesian locations.I have really enjoyed this blend. For me it has a medium body with a wonderful taste and low acidity.I hope the replacement is like this also.
5,Great coffee and great service,"While I love the coffee, and the service was as well, I hate being forced into writing more than is necessary. Thanks"
5,Best Coffee Hands Down!,"Tully's Kona is our favorite K-Cup! Took some to the office and now most are hooked on it also. You can't beat the taste. However, about 2 cups is enough caffeine for most. It's somewhat hard to find in stores as stock usually goes fast. It's nice to be able to buy it in bulk on Amazon."
5,Great Coffee,"This is my favorite coffee for my Kuerig coffee maker and this was a good price; only place I've gotten it cheaper is at Khols when they run it on sale and I have a % off coupon, plus when they give out Khols Cash then I can go back and get more for free. But, that's a drive for me and this only takes a few key strokes on the PC"
5,"Great Music, fun classical","I am a teacher and this is classical music, but more driving and ""fun,"" because it is, of course, punk music from the early scene (mostly UK). All the songs are well done (in my opinion), and I enjoy the variety greatly. It's such great mood music. The first time I ever heard it is when some friends of mine played it for their wedding march music, good choice (well at least for them)."
2,Be Very Careful,"An interesting concept, but to me, a bit flawed. First of all, I'd rather have a comp. CD of all these songs done by the original artists, but that's not what this is. I'm rating it two stars because it was a somewhat fascinating experience to listen to these songs played by a competant orchestra. BUT, after one listen, you say, ""Wow, that was pretty neat,"" but after repeated listenings, the sentiment is more like, ""This is growing tiresome fast. Where are my good old punk CDs?""If you dig classical music, you might get a bit more use out of this CD than I did. I enjoy classical now and then, but I'd rather listen to the masters, than listen to this type of gimmick CD. To me, it just doesn't hold up. After a while, this CD reminded me of bad elevator muzak.I suggest you take full advantage of Amazon's provided sound bites and think long and hard if this is the type of CD that will get repeated playings or become just another dust collector sitting unused on the shelf."
3,Too Large for rods,"Purchased these as they appeared to be the size needed for some towel rods purchased separately. The end caps turned out to be too large for the towel rods, but at least the towel rods came with the right sized end caps.Don't recall if the shipment arrived on time or not. No damage to it."
5,Great for Kids who love dinosaurs,"After watching this cartoon on TV, my son wanted a dinosaur themed party for his 4th birthday. We ordered this DVD online from Amazon and the delivery was excellent. The product was excellent as well.We did have a dinosaur themed birthday party and played this cartoon for kids to watch. Everyone enjoyed it! He still watches it even now.It is about 3 kids who are part of the D-Team, discover that dinosaurs are still present in the world and they venture our to save them from the evil Alpha gang. The DVD is split up into small episodes. So it is nice for little kids who can watch short cartoons instead of a long movie."
2,No trading card included.,I rated this product at two stars because it was suppose to come with a trading card and it did not. My son was extremely disappointed.
4,dinomania,"This was actually for our grandsons, & they just love it! Anything to do with dinosaurs, & it's great!"
5,Excellent collection of quotes!,"If you're in love with someone you'll most definitely appreciate all the quotes in this little book. Its a gem. The quotes are so true, maintaining such a good sense of reality while at the same time the thoughts are so lofty and yet true of any people who are in love.This is a perfect gift for your girlfriend, wife or anyone you're in deep love with."
5,EXCELLENT,Touching performances by principals. Definitely worth a look if not a purchase. Michael Worth is wonderful in thismovie. HIGHEST recommendation!
5,"I love rock, and this is rock, so I love it.","Well, I pretty much said everything I had to say in my review title. I also love this Deep Purple album called ""Who Do We Think We Are!"" -- it rocks almost as much as this one, but not quite. Oneida is better than Deep Purple."
2,The Father Heart of God,"I tried to read this book a few times, its a little dry and legalistic. Not quite meant for me."
2,Self-satisfied - and needs a good proofreader!,"I thought this might be more interesting than it is...Dr. Godwin never misses a chance to put the F.B.I. down...and that might be acceptable if he hadn't written such a pedantic book. I did not expect a new Ann Rule or Carlton Smith, but Godwin saps the life out of both killer and victim. Worse of all are the errors running throughtout - in one chapter he refers to the victims as sisters when in fact they were mother and daughter; in another (facing pages, yet!) he alludes to killings occurring in the 1990's when they occurred in the early 1970's - accotding to Godwin's book."
4,That Certain Something!,"Finally, a book that black men will want to read. Nothing personal ladies but all the baby-momma-drama lit does nothing for me. A lady friend of mine gave me this book and I haven't stopped thanking her since. Ladies, this is the perfect gift for those men in your life who like to read. Mr. Jackson really captures the duality of feelings I think we African-American men have to deal with on a day to day basis. There were times when it seemed to me that the author was writing from such a real place that I had to put the book down and really think about what the author was saying. I think that any person of color who reads this book will know exactly how the main character feels, male or female. Just as I hope people not of color will see this book as a eye opener. My only problem with the book was it's length. It was over way too soon. Then again, the book might have lost some of it's intensity if the author had've drug the story out."
3,Marineland Burnouts,I had two of these and both have burnt out! They were not wet and no other issues were found. This happened in two different outlets. It's starting to make me suspcious.
4,works good -- a foible or two,"Plays cds and mp3s just fine. The ""hold"" button is vital once play has started -- the buttons on the face-plate will activate if you are carrying it around, like in your pocket -- so play is easily interrupted, or the screen info will change in unexpected ways. If you don't turn it all the way off with two clicks of the ""stop"" button, the play will continue and the batteries will drain, resulting in a very unstable performance that will start play and stop after a few minutes -- annoying til you figure it out. I use this to play old time radio catalog radio shows, and the manual fails to explain that holding down the ""next program"" button will give you a fast-forward function. It's bare-bones, rattles a bit, but it plays good and the price is right."
3,"Good book, but too outdated","Make sure you don't have other sources of information before buying this book. Technology moves too quickly and a book printed on 2001-2002 no longer holds true for most (Google wasn't there, was it? well, just for few year but not the quality of web apps that are currently out there!). I don't know of anyone that still uses Windows 9X or even 2000... Think about it before you buy, you will want to get a 2010 at the minimum to keep up with newest web application topics.Other than that, it is a very complete book since it covers all the way from python programming OOP, then goes to databases, web servers all the way to web applications. That is actually very nice. But eating old food might make you sick. It would be nice to have a new edition soon, the content would be completely working."
2,Not right on the mark,"If you want to use Python to write a Web Server, this might be the book for you.If you want to use Python to write a server-side script, look elsewhere."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book, which not only gives a useful introduction to Python, but also gives very good introduction to the topics of networking, databases, and anything and everything web-app related. And a pile of other stuff too.Each section starts from the assumption that the reader knows nothing about the topic, yet doesn't patronise, or paddle along at too slow a pace.There are a few things that bothered me about this book: It would have been really nice to have pointers to further information and articles for each topic, a better index and fewer references to language features that aren't actually explained anywhere (such as list comprehension).Apart from these smaller complaints this book is really very good. Perhaps the bast thing about it is that it explains how all the various technologies fit together. Well worth buying."
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered a book RED TAIL CAPTURED, RED TAIL FREE. The picture of the book on amazon.com shows a nice jacket on the book with the author's picture. When I received the book it was just a plain blue book. I am very disappointed as I had the opportunity to get the book signed but was ashamed to bring it out. Something is definitely wrong with this. The book itself is awesome, but the appearance is embarrassing! Don't get me wrong---THE BOOK IS AWESOME. Just the delivery of the item was rotten."
4,Works great but a little long,"Just installed these along with new plugs. They fit and work just as they should. They are a little long, which didn't really casue any problems except the one for #6 cyl is pretty close to the steering shaft, I'll have to keep an eye on it to make sure it's not rubbing. From what I understand these vehicles came with 2 different coils so depending on which ones you have they may fit just right or be a little long, guess bosch didn't want to bother making 2 different sets if the longer ones can fit for the shorter application."
