3,2 AND 1/2 STARS,"For me, this is Richard Laymon's weakest book. The unlikable main character, Alice, makes the reader not care about her dangerous situations. After a few chapters, you keep wondering how this much bad luck can happen to one person over the course of a couple days. It's too implausible. With all that being said, this book probably has more sex than any of his previous works, so it's definitely not for kids. Give IN THE DARK, ISLAND, or THE TRAVELING VAMPIRE SHOW a read first."
1,"DUmb, boring","If you need an extensive primer on how to clean up after you kill someone, or like reading disgusting sex scenes and unbelievable plots this book is for you. Was a giant waste of my time. Wasn't scary just boring."
4,A 4 1/2 STAR REVIEW,"Alice is a woman on the edge. After experiencing self-defense gone wrong, she must find a way to free her binds from her mistake, while violent consequences ensue. Richard Laymon's AFTER MIDNIGHT is undoubtedly candy for the eye. Readers will have a field day following the misadventures of a protagonist not only tough but set with a mind as sharp as any pointed object. Again, the author doesn't just slowly but surely build up momentum, but throws it in a handful of action, suspense and gore that hold interest up until the edge-of-your-seat denouement that has to be read to be believed. Yes, Laymon is infatuated with the female form, and yes, his plot tends to be over the top, but his wicked pen sure compensates for these little ""flaws"". His sense of timing and deliverance make AFTER MIDNIGHT a fun grade-B treat that deserves its big following.-----Martin Boucher"
1,Wrong Size,I was never able to receive the correct size shield after numerous tries (returns & replacements). I just gave up and kept the small one for the Wobblelight Jr. I will never be able to use. I needed the 27-inch. Annoying.
2,Somewhat Dubious,"How can someone trust an author who admits to cheating. Van Maanen writes, ""In the academy, I helped cover for tardy classmates by concocting what I thought to be reasonable tales to tell superior officers. Several times I cheated on exams by passing my answer sheet around the back of the room (as I looked at others' answers sheets). These mostly mundane matters would hardly be worth mentioning were it not for the fact that they point to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of maintaining a clear cut and recognizable observational or participatory research role.""Having openly admitted to cheating in this instance, how could anything he writes be accepted as authentic? To me this is not a mundane matter, it goes to the heart of ethics. Van Maanen can write and tell a story, but how do we know his cheating isn't part of the plot."
4,Nice.,"As with all things the Oxes do, this kicks butt, especially the first two tracks. It's a blast to hear Marc bust out the slide on track 2 like that. The final track is actually a funny little dance number. If you enjoy loud, phrenetic rock, the first two tracks alone make this album a must.P.S. - See them live. Anything outside a Melt Banana or Lightning Bolt show will seem like crap in comparison afterwards."
3,Camp chef side shelf set,It is good as shelf but it would have better to use it as lid without removing the side & back panels.
4,great utility!,"Shelves work great! love my stove and these shelves hold a lot of weight. I can put my hose, wind guard, and grill brush inside and the shelves lock it all in! One catch - the paint chips easily"
5,Camp Chef Side Shelf,"We really Love our two burner camp chef stove but there was no area to put things that came with the stove. So, this is the answer to that... workes great and now we have that needed Camping stove area to prepare food etc... Folds into the stove and it's carring bag just fine...try it...you eill like it."
2,OTR who took the March 2000 NBCOT exam,"I used this book as a study guide to practice my timing by answering 200 question at a time within the 4 hour period given for the NBCOT exam. I found that the questions did not even come close to what was on the certification exam, but it was helpful because it looks at all aspects of therapy. My advice would be to order the NBCOT study guide because it comes the closest to what you will see on the actual exam. Good Luck."
1,Save your money,"I bought this book to prepare for the NBCOT exam, and found it to be pretty much useless. The questions are not formatted or in anyway similar to those on the exam, and the answers in the back are very brief, one or two sentances,and don't offer much clarification or explanation regarding correct or incorrect answers. I found that most of the book focuses on terminology or basic concepts; not at all as in depth or as situational as the real exam."
3,An okay review book,"Some of the questions are poorly written and explanations for answers are often very brief. The diskette uses the same questions as the book, so I didn't find it very helpful. I wish the diskette would have had at least some (if not all) new questions.The book does use many domain style questions (like the NBCOT exam). I wouldn't recommend this book to be the only book you use to prepare for the exam, but it is somewhat useful."
1,Terrible review,"This book only review's the right answer on the questions. It does not go indepth on why an answer is right OR wrong. Some of the questions have you wondering, where did I learn some of this stuff from? The material in this book, is VERY different from the study material in other books I have used. It is very hard to review of this book, and non-user friendly."
2,OT exam review book,"I have the earlier edition of this book, and bought this edition to get new questions. Sadly to say, there were only a few new questions. I am quite disappointed."
2,DVD,You can t judge a book by its cover poor acting and no story line to it and by the title of the movie I thought this movie would have been better proform
2,Not What I Expected to Hear,"I saw this band live a very long time ago and instantly fell in love with their sound. I wasn't able to find the ""Drama"" CD for another couple of years after the show, though. Once I did, it was on my regular rotation. I knew they had some earlier work, but didn't have a chance to hear it until I found this early discography album. I was not impressed. You can definitely hear that they were still developing their sound, but even the early ideas were not that great. I was bored the whole way through. I've read other glowing reviews, and that's fine. Musical taste is a very individual thing. If you're looking for a repeat or an early, more primitive version of the ""Drama"" album, you will not find it here. If you are a long time fan and already have some of this material on vinyl, this is right up your alley. It definitely wasn't for me."
3,Old lovesong ..never lost its actuality,"The song ""Tonight I celebrate my love for You"" took a great fealng to my heart , when i heared it first time.So i looked where to buy or coppy the song. I ordered it whith EMERSON in the USA.Forgott the order ... and was very surprised, when the CD arrived propperly.I'm very content whith the maioling. Megiki68 from ""old""Germany"
2,RIP $23,This book bag is good at first...... the first day of school was fine.....but the second day after my friend pat my back the bag ripped at the top....such a nice way of spending 25 bucks
5,NICE PACE AND GREAT TEACHER,HAD A STROKE 7 YEARS AGO AND NEEDED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SAW FIRST ON PBS. TEACHER IS SUPER HOT LADY AND MOVES SO WELL YOGA LIKE
5,Applegator43,"Originally my neighbor recommended this video as she had borrowed it from the library. I ended up ordering one for myself and the neighbor as I found it to be an extremely enlightening dvd. Peggy, goes through and explains all moves. There is NO music to distract you in doing the various moves. Highly recommended."
4,Quando le vita Cambiera`,If you are a Gigi fan you'll love this new album. He sticks to love themes and of course life in Naples. He makes you feel like you are in the heart of the city. My Neopolitan boyfriend and myself sing along to all the tracks in the car. It is very romantic.
5,Gigi D'Alessio Totally Rocks!,"Listen up peeps! This album totally ROCKS! My boyfriend gave it to me as a present with this translated quote by G. D'Alessio...""Without you, I'm going to feel 'like a child that didn't find anything under the Christmas tree.'"" Even though I don't speak Italian, I would recommend this album to anyone that loves good Italian music sung from the heart with an occasional beat (catchy tunes too!). (There is always something lost in translation, but these lyrics are GREAT!) So what are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW! =)"
4,New Direction,"This album takes Gigi on a new direction when compared with previous efforts. It took me a couple of times listening to the album to ""get into it"" but did so quickly. Not as good as Ramazotti, but I think that this guy is someone to watch over then next couple of years - Interested in listening to his 2001 release to see how much he has evolved over the past 12 months."
2,It does not work,"I have been putting it acne scars and surgery scars but no improvement. In addition, when I put on my face, dried gel comes off as if my skin is peeling off which is ugly and I have to take it off right away. I should have stuck with Maderma lotion one, which worked better and no peeling off."
1,Had to throw it away.,"It did not work at all! In addition, I caused my allergy and even made my scars obvious.Expensive and waste of money."
2,Disapointed,"I had purschased this product before and was very happy with it. The first cream I got only had to be used once a day.This second tube was the same size and cost almost the same, but had to be used 3 or 4 times a day. I guess there was not enough information about second tube."
5,Fantastic,"I just got ""Silent Conspiracy"" today, and I just finished it over an hour ago. The characters are well-developed, the plot with its usual mysterious twists and turns, and though he take a few licks, he still comes out on top. I guess what intrigued me most about this novel is the fact that a couple of black men disappear into thin air after walking into a murder they had nothing to do with. We see how the community comes to the aid of these men and how they close ranks on outsiders. The book was very reminiscent of its times (the 50's), rascist cops, pre-civil rights. I liked Lincoln for his persistence. Erotica, I didn't like because at times she seem to set him on a wild goose chase.Craig Roberts and Brinkman were not favorites, but one could not resist loving Mrs.Dibell. A real good intriging book."
5,A real pageturner with great twists!,"If you haven't read this book, you have missed a great treat! Lincoln Keller is a true character of substance and drive. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and look forward to more."
5,An Exciting Read,"I normally prefer ""cozy"" mysteries but I'm glad I gave Silent Conspiracy a try. Lee Meadows has created a compelling leading man in Lincoln Keller. I look forward to a sequel. If you read Silent Conspiracy you wont forget it any time soon.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men."
5,Easy Rawlings and Sam Spade Move Over...,"Lincoln Keller is joining the ranks as the new P.I. in the noir world of mystery writing. Lee Meadows creates a P.I. that follows in the tradition of the independent, tough but decent gumshoe with the added twist of a backup trio of equally adept brothers. Like the masters of the genre, he deftly interweaves character, dialog, a sense of place (Detroit) and social consciousness into a page turning tale. And yes, it would make a great movie."
4,A page turner with a surprise ending.,"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I found myself riveted and fascinated. The character development is great. The story is entertaining. I put it as a must read. I'm looking forward for more in the Lincoln Keller series. Walter Mosley, look out!"
4,Silent Conspiracy,"A first mystery by Lee Meadows turned out to be very good once I got into the storyline. The characters are very believable, one can see the action, and there were a lot of twists and turns. I enjoy music and Detroit came alive for me. The book really kept me guessing. I fell in love with Lincoln and one couldn't help but get entwined with the other characters and how they all related. I really liked how the black church, community stuck by the the missing group, The Sentinents. I am looking forward to getting started on his next book, which I am fortunate enough to have an autographed copy, ""Silent Suspicions"" Thanks Lee, I am fan for life. Phyllis Moore, WV"
4,Informative Historical Perspective,"In the preface, G. N. Clark tells us of Johan Huizinga that his ""great success and reputation came suddenly when he was over forty. Until that time his powers were ripening, not so much slowly as secretly.""Huizinga starts his history of Erasmus with his childhood. He was born in Rotterdam, Holland in 1466. His years in the monastery are covered in the second chapter. We're told he was well read in Jerome. Furthermore he was consumed with the works of St. Augustine. In the summer of 1495 his studies carried him to the University of Paris. It was on this campus that a struggle of ideas was occurring. The story continues as Erasmus goes to England.Erasmus was a true wandering scholar at times with no home of his own. In describing his travels, his studies, his love of God, his calling, the modern Christian scholar can sense the continuity of the personalities who went ahead to pave the way for our contritutions."
5,liberator family. need i say more?,"anyone deep into the underground music scene should have at least heard of christ liberator and his family, such as d.d.r, d.a.v.e the drummer, lawrie immersion, etc.. this cd is definitely one of the BEST acid trance you can get in the world."
5,"Buy it if only for ""Heaven of My Life""","A seminal R&B experiment that has been grossly overlooked, this album is a MUST have. Smooth disco /r&b soul. Track of note: ""Heaven of My Life"" a seemingly endless song glazed with flawless Luther Vandross vocals gliding over a frothy staccatto guitar riff. I defy anyone to remain motionless listening to this song!!"
2,A Good Start But Far To Go,"It is refreshing to see a book finally uncovering a previously hidden area in the US, a statistical source for the major leagues of baseball in Japan. However, this publication is not a comprehensive encyclopedia of Japanese baseball.Information on team performances and leaders in individual seasons is featured up to 1997. A section is devoted to lifetime and individual category leaders. Appendices are provided which list no-hitters, the Japanese Hall of Fame, and a list of ""foreign"" teams which have played in Japan. There is also an index which facilitates looking up players who are mentioned in the book.But if you are looking for a comprehensive, detailed guide to every player with their stats, this is not the book. That being said, this book is better than the alternative, which is nothing, and I did enjoy filling in the blanks on Warren Cromartie's baseball card."
2,Not KONG Quality,"My 1 year old Goldendoodle destroyed this after a few days. I thought that since it was a KONG it'd be indestructible, this was NOT the case.After playing a bit of fetch and letting her gnaw on it she quickly had the ends, where the holes are, chewed away with big chunks missing. I was finding red plastic chunks in her poop for a few more days :(She has destroyed many toys, including the KONG frisbee. If you dog is like this all I can recommend is the original KONG. It has survived 10 months of her chewing."
5,KONG TOUGH!,"Our english springers, who LOVE to destroy standard squeaky toys, plush animals, etc, are crazy about Kong products. We usually get the cone shaped versions, but these are a lot more heavy duty and they gnaw on them all day long. We never have to worry about putting treats inside either. Thanks KONG!"
2,Not for an aggressive chewer,We have a 10 month old 65lb lab/mix. She chewed pieces off within five minutes. We had to take it away from her because she was eating it! We have the black Kong which is holdong up great and thought this would be up to the same standards but was not. Not for an aggressive chewer!
3,My Golden Retriever made short work of this,"I always bought Kong toys for my last Golden, as they seemed to last longer than the average chew toy. I have a new Golden now, and either his teeth are way sharper (possible) or the Kong ain't what it used to be. He had breached the integrity of this toy by day two or three, and once that happens, it's not long before you are finding little pieces of red rubber all over your house, your yard, and in your dog's turds. If they hold up, they really help keep your dog's teeth clean, and the dogs adore them. I just wish that for the hefty price tag, they would last a little longer in the jaws of the retriever breeds."
3,It's OK,It is OK and seems to be long lasting. It took a while for my dog to get used to it and now he likes it more.
1,Horrible...original kong much better,My dog had this kong in pieces and it only took him 24 hours to do so. would not recommend getting this.
1,Gone in 35 minutes,35 minutes and it was gone. Yes he chewed it up in 35 minutes. What a waste of money this was.
1,From Package to Trash in 20 minutes,I have read that KONG is one of the best toys for dogs with a chewing habit. I bought this item becuase I wanted to get a chew toy that I could put treats inside so that it would keep my dog occupied for a bit. He was occupied for 20 minutes...it too him 10 minutes to get the treat and then he continued to destroy the toy for the next ten.
4,Pretty good,"My dog gets a little bored with this but I put peanut butter in it and freeze overnight and its a good treat. Plus, he is a heavy chewer and has not destroyed it yet."
4,Good chew toy,My dog likes to chew on this toy but doesn't really like anything put in it so I'm disappointed with that aspect of it. I could have just got a regular chew toy. It's held up nicely to a pitbull's jaw.
5,Something Different from Glenn Danzig,"Being once again the master of innovation that he is, Glenn Danzig ventures into the classical-obscure-gothic-medieval-celtic realms with Black Aria. Something definitely different from his black-heavy metal sound, this is one you'll have to listen to, to understand the greatness behind it. Half of the record is about Milton's book Paradise Lost (with song titles like ""Overture of the Rebel Angels"" or ""Battle for Heaven"")It is a masterpiece more than worthy of deserving a place in your record collection. Buy it. Now."
5,Replacement Stylus for PA688 Turntable works great!,This product worked perfectly as advertized and was received in perfect condition and less than the amount of time expected.
4,PERFECT FOR MY TEENAGER,"The perfect book for my teen to learn about the incredible history of our country! I have enjoyed other offerings by William J. Bennett, too."
4,A Patriotic Book for a young to mid-teen,"Book provides patriotic, historical background. Bought it for my 14-year old grandson. He is an accelerated reader, and I thought ths was aimed at a teen or young person who is not accustomed to reading adult literature. Despite that assessment, this book is a valuable addition to a young person's library. Serves as a historical foundation upon which to build."
2,one-dimensional vocals,"I have read with interest about her supposed 5-octave range, and the rich eclecticism of her music, but to me it all sounded very one-dimensional, repetitive, and ultimately boring. I found myself quickly reminded of Macy Gray - similar irritating cartoonish qualities. It's obvious a lot of [money]was spent on production, but it all sounds uninspired. I was hoping for something along the lines of India.Arie, Nikka Costa, or Res - no [such]luck."
4,Lamya,"I think that ""Learing From Falling"" by Lamya is going to be an album that is definitely worth a listen. I think she will be an artist to look out for. The song ""Never Enough"" reflects a strong women. The song has a rock, blues, and soul feel with lyrics that any women can relate to. Who hasn't watched a man waste our time?! Lamya's not taken it. Lamya's voice is so flexible that her song ""East of Anywhere"" almost has a different sound. This song reminds us that we too need to find a place where we are free to think and feel good without even knowing why. A place where no one will judge, whatever will be will be. All we need is space. I can't wait to hear more from Lamya. I hope everyone gives her a listen!"
2,Buy the single,"If you like the somg 'Empires', which I do, buy the single. The rest of the album doesn't measure up. Her voice is fantastic, more Macy Gray than Kate Bush or Bjork, but the songs are dull dull dull."
5,Diversity personified in music,"Lamya gives the music world a fresh voice, unique to the hum-drum same sounds of the radio. Lamya gives her audience a strong feminine presence without aggitating the more conservative listener. This is a great album to hum or sing along with in the car or walking down the street - or in the shower if you please."
4,Learning from Falling~Lamya,"At first I wasn't to sure about Lamya because I tend to listen to harder music. I was pleasantly surprised by the musicianship displayed by this CD. Normally, with many new artists you get over produced unsoulful garbage, but not in this case. Lamya sings with complete passion. She displays an interesting mix of vocal styles. While influences like Nelly Furtado and Bjork can be heard a unique sound does shine through.From the song Empires to the final note in Pink Moon the CD reveals a rainbow of sound. Whether you listen to rock or R&B or whatever, I would highly recommend this album. It's an CD that you can listen to all the way through. Who wants to pay for anything else."
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"There is nothing memorable, ground breaking, or even authentic sounding about this grooveless album, but massage therapists might like it for background music."
2,Not what I expected,"After Elle and In Style mags mentioned this CD I signed up to buy it before it was even released. What I read about was Brasilian, folk, funk fusion music, what's on the CD is a mature version of Macy Gray without a beat to follow along with or get into. I played it once and regret the purchase."
4,Great Poster,"I was really impressed to see the poster was printed on photo paper, and was of a high quality, high gloss appearance. The only deficiency I note is that the dimensions are slightly, just slightly smaller than a full 24x36 inches."
2,Misleading advertisement,"I am very disappointed with this CD. The advertisement was misleading by giving the impression that it was a Bill Evans recording. Instead, it was recordings with a hint of Bill Evans by other groups.I bought two of them, one for my son, one for myself, and I reiterate that the advertising was false!"
1,Junk,The player quits workng often and requires you to remove and reinstall the battery before it will turn back on. It is junk - do not buy.
1,Best described as junk.,"Christmas present for daughter. After 2 days, when you turn it on it cycles non stop between Rave flash screen and turning off. This will continue until you take out battery and put back in. Updated the firmware from website, fixed problem for 2 more days. Now it will not turn on at all. First several attempts at their service number resulted in a message in Spanish followed by a hangup. Daughter saud, ""You should have bought an IPod."" Thanks Rave. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS."
1,Could barely force myself to finish it...,"On long car trips, I sometimes take a novel to read aloud while my husband drives. (Yes, I read ""girly"" books, but he eventually gets interested enough in the plot to hear it to the end.) Unfortunately, this was the novel I picked up for a 10 hour car drive. Ugh! I'm not sure why it was bad, but I think it was the writing itself. It's been a few weeks & I can't really remember much of the plot, either. I would not recommend this book. Check out a Marian Keyes novel instead...MUCH better."
3,Passable but really...,"I am not a big fan of olivia goldsmith... but i was capitivated by the summary of the book and grabbed it to read. The book is not as good as any other olivia goldsmith books but it is still passable and not that bad.This book pushes me to read other olivia goldsmith books as I am impressed by her style of writing and her wit. Those Olivia Goldsmith die-hard fans will find this very disappointing but those just starting out to read her books will find it not too bad. I liked the ending too.I think she shouldn't have written about something she didn't really know and the whole bad-boy change didn't really hit off well. However, I liked the character of Tracie as well as Jon as well as Tracie's oblivion to Jon's love. It made quite interesting reading."
1,Deserves no star - absolutely disappointing,"Like other reviewers I was delighted when the new book came out and I could not wait to buy it. What a disappointment! It is not at all what I had expected. That the end is so forseeable is one of the minor problems - what is worse it that the characters, especially ""heroine"" Tracie, are so absolutely silly and unlikeable! No comparison to the strong, smart women in Olivia Goldsmith's former books!Goldsmiths strength were revenge stories - where the bad get their comeuppance and the good win. But in this one ... Perhaps it was meant to be a satire - but then it is a bad one.If a new Olivia Goldsmith book comes out, I will certainly not buy it impulsively!"
1,Don't Bother!,"Awful! Awful! Awful! The girl lead in this book (Tracie) is a self-centered, shallow, egomaniacal b...h. She treated the male lead (Jon) like trash, turning him into something she thought was the ideal man. For someone like her, maybe he was. I agree that this book is predictable, but I kept reading hoping for Tracie to get some comeuppance, but of course in the end, Jon turned out to be as big an idiot as she turned him into and lowered himself to take her back. I don't care how long you have been in love with someone, if it took them completely changing you to find out they loved you, they never loved the REAL you to begin with and I thought the character of Jon started out that smart, but in the end the author turned him into nothing more than a horny, desperate man that would settle for someone that wanted to change him. Don't waste your money or even bother to check this out of the library!"
1,Where's the -1*?,"I don't know what the tape is like, but the book makes Whitney Houston's lyrics...sound good. And, I can't think of any lower praise than that. First of all, the author has never been to Seattle, and she should only write about things that she has intimate experience with, like the display table at Nieman-Marcus. Secondly, we would never allow anyone as stupid as Tracie to work at the Seattle Communist Times. Thirdly, any woman in Seattle would love to go out with Jon, because nice, rich guys at MSFT would look yummy compared to all the obscene Bad Boys that inhabit the underworld of Seattle, but no one from Hell-A would know that.Glad I didn't finish the book."
1,"another JUST COULDN'T FINISH IT, IT WAS SO BAD","The cover was the best thing about this book. Just don't bother to open it. Tracy and Jon are two of the stupidest people I've stumbled across in the Romance world, and believe me there are plenty. The only thing you can say is ""they deserve each other but why did they waste everyone's time getting there?"""
4,A thoroughly enjoyable read!,I'm surprised at all the negative comments on this book. I thought it was very entertaining and funny. A really good read.
1,"Annoying characters, too much detail","This is the first book I've encountered by this author, and I can say that I won't be looking for her other works. The characters were condescending, and frankly, the characters who were supposed to be ""cool"" reminded me of the socially inept people you desperately try to avoid at parties. The dialogue didn't come across as spontaneous at all, and the plot was very predictable. Goldsmith includes too much detail in her descriptions (e.g., do we really need to know every facial movement each character makes?), which makes the story drag. Although I like the idea of a male version of the makeover story, I was deeply disappointed by this book."
1,What happened to the editor?,"I honestly don't think I've ever read a book with so many inconsistencies in it. I won't go into them, although they were annoying (along the lines of: Phil puts on his jacket and leaves, but is nibbling Tracie's ear two paragraphs later???).The very worst mistake(unforgivable), to me, was that the first time Jon and Tracie ""get together"", he had just been in bed with Allison. GROSS! He leaves Allison in bed, races across town, and finally takes Tracie to bed, supposedly after years of loving her. No shower first. How romantic is that? Where was the editor?"
1,What a waste of time,"Totally predictable and not worth the energy spent turning the pages. Granted, you don't expect Goldsmith to be Shakespeare, but this even falls below her previous works. ""First Wives Club"" and others have redeeming moments, are humorous and a diverting ""fun"" read .... but this is just awful, demeaning, page-filler!"
1,Olivia Goldsmith should be ashamed...,"...and so should her editors and publishers. This book is just awful. It would be good had it been written by a high school sophomore as an extra credit project. The subject material, the style are just plain frenetic, and it runs out of breath in about 35 pages. Actually, I suspect that this book was written by someone other than the author of ""The First Wives' Club"". It's that bad and that different."
1,trash to the trash,"Based on the excellent, clever movie ""The First Wives Club"", I bought two of Olivia Goldsmith's books. Both went into the trash. ""Bad Boy"" is disapponting and poorly written with a very preditable plot."
2,Nicholas Richview Middle,"The story was about a boy born in a crowd of people. The boys mom died when he was 8 . years old. The boy was adopted and lived in a little town called Harlem. The boys name was Walter Dean. He was always in a fight at school in Mr. Conroys class. This caused the boy to miss so m up to write this book school that they were going to put him in a juvinele faciliy. The boy learned to stop fighting and that is how the story ends.I liked the book because I was like the boy in a way,I was always getting in trouble. I would get my friends to rend this book because the boy had a hard life and was adopted and poor and grew up to write this book"
2,Sara Bird Did It Better and First,"I may have liked this novel better if it hadn't so clearly reminded me of an earlier novel by Sara Bird called ""The Boyfriend School."" That book is now out-of-print but if readers really like this plotline of turning a nice guy into a bad boy so he can score with women, Bird does it better. The big difference between the two novels is that his romance author sister transforms her brother in ""Boyfriend School"" whereas in ""Bad Boy"" it is his best friend, who is a woman hooked up with her own bad boy, who undertakes this transformation. I wouldn't have even guessed that this was the same author as the one who wrote ""Fashionably Late,"" ""Best Seller,"" and ""Flavor Of The Month"" if her name hadn't been on it. I hope this is just a misfire and doesn't mean Goldsmith has run out of good ideas."
3,A Great Example of a True Story,Bad Boy by Walter Dean Myers is a good story that explains his childhood life. This book tells a story about the experiences he had as a kid growing up in Harlem New York. As he's growing up in Harlem he sees how difficult life is for him self and the people around him. This book show how a person can help them self's be a better person but getting the impression that he's just like everyone else around him. This book is a good book to read if you like books that tell a true story.
4,I enjoyed this audio about bad boys,"I really liked this story by the author of the First Wives Club.This is the story of best friends Tracie and Johnny. Tracie is always going for the bad boys and Johnny is a nice guy who can't seem to get a date. Well he gets Tracie to turn him into a bad guy. But, are either of them really ready for this? Also this story is well written and the characters are rather well developed.As things progress you also get to see that things in real life usually do have some consequence, especially when you take things for granted and don't think things completely through."
5,Bad Boy!,"I personally think that Bay Boy is a great story and Myers is a very strong person. He went through so much in life and he still accomplished many goals in life. He went through a bad childhood growing up like fightin alot with peers. he struggled alot because he had a sppech impairment that made him mess up alll the time when he would talk.he grew in up the city of Harlem, New york. He endures so much pain through life that it's crazy to believe that it didn't have a big breakdown.He faced racial iisues in life, which i'm sure caused great pain because i know how it feels. He loved to read and that was a good thing and he had a dream of becoming a writer for children's books which he is now. he has a great heart and is a very strong human being. His life story can touch all hearts both cold and warm."
4,A VERY FUNNY NOVEL!,"Tracie Higgins is a writer in a dead-end relationship with a musician. Jon is a work-aholic who can't get ANY KIND OF relationship. These two young people are good friends, and every Sunday night thet get together for coffee, and to talk about their problems.Jon gets an idea, he can have Tracie transform him into a heartbreaker, the kind of guy women fall all over. At first Tracie thinks the idea is silly, but she does agree to help her friend. What ensues is a hysterical journey of expensive haircuts, the latest fashions, and very bad pick-ups ( the airport scene being one of the funniest).As the two continue with the scheme, they realize they both MAY have found the right person...in each other.""Bad Boy"" is another funny read from Olivia Goldsmith. Ms. Goldsmith has the knack of churning out fresh, funny, and totally un-putdownable novels.Readers will undoubtly root for true love to prevail, once they have caught their breath from laughing so hard.Nick Gonnella"
2,Could Have Been Better,"Kind of slow reading, with conversational gems few and far between. Not up to Goldsmith's normally witty style--seems kind of tired, and plods along at times like an old horse at the end of a hard work day. Needed major editing. I would not recommend purchasing this book, perhaps borrow from a friend or library, but not worth adding to your own collection. I would not recommend. Read only if extremely bored, or while snoozing at the beach."
2,Thumbs down from this Goldsmith fan,"I love Olivia Goldsmith's books -- THE BESTSELLER is one of the best-ever books in its genre, and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB and FLAVOR OF THE MONTH were tremendous fun. So I couldn't wait to read this book. What a disappointment. Goldsmith is far better at capturing the lives of glittering, glamorous people than a group of fairly ordinary Seattle twentysomethings. The plot is predictable from beginning to end. And did Goldsmith even visit Seattle, or did she do her research long distance? At one point Jon goes to the Seattle airport because he thinks it would be a good place to pick up women. He zeroes in on a flight arriving from Tacoma. Uh, Olivia, the Seattle airport is practically IN Tacoma. That's why it's called SEATAC.Arriving only 11 months after the 500-page YOUNG WIVES, BAD BOY is a bad book that I can only imagine Goldsmith simply rushed to finish. Next time, I hope she takes a little more time and produces a yummy novel that's worth waiting for."
2,Rather Pointless,"I was looking forward to a wickedly fun read, and was very very disappointed. This was a rather dull and rather long drawn out affair, which seemed hastily written and full of characters with pointless lives, and who exist in the book for pointless reasons. The cover is nice, but as has been said, you can't judge a book by it's cover. Olivia Goldsmith can write, and can write very well, but took a dive on this one."
1,Bad Boy...Bad Book!,"I totally agree with the readers who found this book a disappointment! The characters were one dimensional and each one was a cliche (i.e. the grumpy, yet big-hearted waitress, the overweight yet big-hearted friend, the beautiful gold-digger)and I never got to the point where I cared what happened to any of them. Plot lines were introduced but never developed...what happened to Tracie's mother, where was her father, how come Jonathan's father married so many times...And after the first chapter, I knew exactly what was going to happen, how it was going to happen, and what the ending of the book would be. A complete waste of my time and my money."
4,Bad Boy,Walter and his family live in Harlem New York. They think Harlem is a very unique place because of the people and the music going on in Harlem. Walter likes all sports and school but has a tendency to get into trouble. Growing up in Harlem with a poor family made Walter realize the racial and class struggles that surround him during his life. When I read the book I liked how the author could relate the situations in the book to the real life problems that are happening around us in 2006. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading about history but also having fun reading it. This book does not have a very hard reading level and word-choice so it would be good for ages 8 to 12. I think some equally good books are River thunder and when Zachary beaver comes to town.
1,It matches part of its name: Bad,"This book was horrible! The main character is self absorbed and one dimensional. Her nerdy best friend is in love with her, for reasons that are unknown to me, because she treats him like...and takes him for granted. She doesn't seem to mind that her ""boyfriend"" Phil uses her and is interested in other girls.The editing was horrible, just like the plot line. Just because Tracie and her friends are stupid enough to stay with ""bad boys"" doesn't mean every other girl in the world is. And it does seem kind of shallow of Tracie to realize she was in love with her friend Jon after she made him look hot. GOD THIS BOOK ANNOYED ME. I only finished because I have a pact with myself to finish any book I pick up and begin to read. Oh and the only reason I bought it was because it was 75% off.God it was definitley a waste of...I would not wish this book upon anyone.If you still want to read it, even after I warned you about it, you are in for lots of boredom and pain."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I usually like Olivia Goldsmith's books, but this book was not even comparable to 'First Wives Club' or some of her other books. It was horrible! The plot was silly, the characters just plain stupid, and very predictable. Don't waste your money."
1,pretty good,"If you want to buy this, you should because it puts you in situations that you had in your life, and you remember that Walter grew up probely as you had and he had problems that you had in school."
2,Predictable at Best,"Oh man. I like First Wives Club and I thought this book would be on par with her earlier work. NOT SO. After reading the first chapter of this book, I could tell you exactly how it was going to end. That is no way to enjoy a book! This wasn't even plane-reading worthy. I was so bored out of my mind waiting for the ""will she realize"" moment that I just wanted to get it over with. There is no way I would buy this book for over $3."
3,Well researched,"The title is intriguing as is the fact that the author did The first wives club, which I haven't read. Ms. Goldsmith has done her research, the writing is tight, the plot line most believeable. It is particularly poinant in today's computer society. While not intellectually groundbreaking, it's a fun book to read and made me laugh outloud many times."
1,GOOD IDEA...BAD EXECUTION---,"This was an eye-rolling, can't-believe-I-wasted-my-time-on-it story. It was supposed to be a geek gets his female best friend (whom he's secretly in love with) to help transform him in to a man women desire story. They succeed...he's a ""hot"", sought-after, sex-machine ""Bad Boy""... then the best friend realizes she's fallen for him.The problems started with the fact that the characters were so darn unlikable. Toss in that the ultra-shallow best friend's definition of a ""Bad Boy"" was turning him in to a total jerk, the kind she liked to date, but few real women would find sexy. Then add that the story drug on and on over mundane details, bounced ALL over the place, resolved nothing, and ended boring and abruptly. It's a shame as this could have been a fresh, fun tale."
1,Waste of Money,"So far, I only listened to one of the cd's. The adult sang some of the songs and he is awful. In addition, there were children singers but they are older children and can't sing either. Sometimes, as a special treat, both the adult and the children would sing (gee thanks).The music is terrible. The songs all sound alike with the goofy sounding instruments. It is hard to explain but it is worse than the singing."
4,Good first impression,"Mix Master stepped up and showed the world how it was done with this opening album and was able to prove why he earned the title Mix Master Mike, winning countless scratch battles. I read at Yahoos bio for him that he was banned from competitions because no one else stood a chance. Whether or not that's true I have yet to prove either way, but listening to this you can see why. A fast and ingenious mixer, he came in with his best foot forward and left a real impression on the music world. A great album well worth the asking price."
3,Look elsewhere for phat beats,"I was really dis-appointed after listening to this ablum. Your high expectations of this mystical mix-master mike are shot down quickly. I really expected more after hearing his tracks from the Beastie's album. They want to compare this crap to DJ Shadow, but there is no comparison. I would recommend buying the real thing instead (DJ Shadow)."
2,This CD is nothing but a disappointment!,"After hearing some of his stuff from the Beastie Boys' CD ""Hello Nasty"", I decided to buy Mix Master Mike's one and only CD; BIG MISTAKE. First of all, there aren't any lyrics! Just samples for old records, and crappy samples at that! I could have dealth with that if the beats were phat, but they were so lame I felt ashamed to be listening to it. After listening to the entire CD a few times over, I decided that every song was a filler. I gave this CD 2 stars because there were only 2 good songs out of 30 or so tracks on it."
5,One of the flyest cd's i own,"I saw Mix Master Mike on MTV's 1515 and had to get his cd after hearing him. This is a defident must buy. Another must have cd is DAFT PUNK'S Homework, the best techno cd's ever made."
4,nice beats.,"MMM is not the illest. Not even close. This ain't next level. It's about half way up the stairs, or maybe it's one of those secret rooms. Nice beats tho."
1,Far too long.,A very long story about a person who is not very likable followed by a search story which rambles endlessly.
3,Repetitive,"Although this book helped one to understand who Randy was and what might have happened to him, it went on for quite sometime stressing how much Randy loved the wilderness...longer than was necessary. Half way through the book, I skipped to the end."
3,Just Falls Short,"Randy Morgenson seems like a fine hard working individual, though a little obsessive about the wildernes. This book falls short as a mystery and as a personality piece.The author does his best to make Randy interesting, but in reality, he is little more than an average Joe who had the misfortune to come up missing.The book is well written, but will be disappointing unless you too are wilderness crazy. One reviewer compared this to a great book, Into the Wild. Sorry, no comparison. Into the Wild is about a genuinely interesting individual whose story was truly fascinating."
3,Author Created Good Read About Not So Interesting Individual,"Excellent writer who made an interesting read about a not-so interesting individual - If a book was written for every committed and knowlegable naturalist who has ever lived and worked in the field for several decades, we would have thousands of books. Morganson goes missing for a couple years and all of a sudden he warrants a book written about himself. The book makes clear that he was arrogant, intolerant of those who did not agree with his philosophies, and he was an unloyal husband (which suggests he was unloyal to all of those who considered him a friend). Of course he knew the scientific names of some plants so this mitigated his flawed characteristics and thus a book was written. I look forward to reading future titles from this gifted writer. I just hope he can pick more compelling subjects. What about a book on Dana Morganson?"
2,Way too long and a bummer to boot,"I found this book to be tedious and depressing and yet I managed to read the entire thing, wanting to find out what finally happened. Randy Morgenson grew up in an idyllic setting (Yosemite Valley), was raised by caring parents, yet managed to make a mess of his life due to what seems to have been an obsession for living alone in the beauty of the Sierra. He married, but was away from home at least half the time, and never had children. Although a legendary and exemplary ranger, he was unfaithful to his long-suffering wife in a three-year affair, became ultimately disillusioned with his obsession, and finally died alone apparently having drowned after falling through a snow bridge into an alpine pond while on patrol. Tragic and depressing."
1,Boring book!,"I really had high hopes for this book, but it's not really an adventure and it-s not interesting at all. Very boring.I regret buying it."
5,A compelling human wilderness story!!,A very strong story that gives you a sense of wilderness as well as a great human story. Randy lived his life his way - for the sierra. Well written by Eric Blehn.
3,"Good read, but way too much background","A good read, especially when the chapters dealt with the search. The author spends far too much time painting a picture of Randy's life from boyhood through his marital issues, in my opinion. Others of course may disagree. In all honesty, that part of his biography could have been summed up in 3 chapters. We get it... his love for the Sierra's, his boyhood spent in the parks, etc shaped him and made him who he was. A very romantic story of his love affair with nature, and how it became the driving force that shaped his every move in life. However, despite this, his life was very vanilla, so no excitement reading paragraph after paragraph will be had.You can actually skim through much of that info and still not lose too much from the story.All in all a decent read, though. Makes you really appreciate the NPS and it's employees, and hope there are many more like Randy with the same drive and passion for the outdoors."
5,A passionate and respectful account,"I discovered Eric Blehm quite recently through his involvement with ""Molly the Owl"" and his subsequent children's book on the subject. As I listened to the passion with which Mr. Blehm spoke of his projects, I felt compelled to seek out his other books. What a fortunate sequence of events for me! ""The Last Season"" held my rapt attention from cover to cover and left me feeling as if I had been part of the story myself. It is apparent throughout that this book took incredible amounts of painstaking and thorough research, but every detail and piece of minutiae is needed. You never feel as if he threw in facts just to show off -- it all contributes to the whole. The story is told with such depth and richness, you can't help but feel in awe of the backcountry rangers and their beloved Sierras. Randy Morgenson himself is portrayed with the respect and reverance he so clearly deserves, despite his personal shortcomings. I feel privileged to have found this book."
5,Sticks with you,"This is a terrific book that takes you inside the life, and head, of a very admirable, but imperfect, person...Randy Morgenson, a park ranger in the Sierra Nevada. The book reads like a compelling mystery novel, but it's true. It is a very fitting tribute to Randy, who had much to share with human kind, but who was not able to find success as a writer himself. This book sticks with you, long after you've finished reading it."
4,Last moments alone and the mystery left behind,"When someone dies alone in the wilderness there are questions to be answered. Eric Blehm took on a big challenge in assembling the material to write this book. For those of us who love the outdoors and go solo into the wilderness we always want to know what happened. . this book made me turn pages late into the night trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Randy. Although I realize that there is much unsaid on the author's part, it is still a good read and if you liked Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" you will love this one too."
4,Two sides to this story,"I purchased this book for the 'mystery' it offered to solve... and was surprised to learn that the greater story is in learning about a backcountry ranger's life. Certainly, Randy Morgenson was an interesting and complicated man, but George Durkee and other rangers chronicled in the book are of the same ilk. Truly devoted individuals (emphasis on the ""individuals""). Randy's devotion to the backcountry (and how it was fostered in his childhood) has stayed with me longer than the mystery of his disappearance. Judging from what his friends have to say, that is probably the way he would have wanted it..."
3,Not all that compelling,"I was hoping for an adventure story but got a somewhat plodding story of the several days search for Randy Morgenson interspersed with his life story. It's not that Randy didn't seem like a great guy and a good ranger, it just didn't make for a great book. The author tried to make the search seem really exciting and intense, and it probably was for the people involved, but I found the description slow and boring. I found myself skimming instead of deep reading. The search itself was marred by misteps, that are never really dealt with by the Park Service. The book also paints an unflattering picture of the National Park Service and our government and the way they treat the seasonal employees (low pay, no benefits, bad radios, no recognition) who are obviously deserving of better treatment. I can understand why those that knew Randy or have hiked or camped in the area would find the book more interesting, but for those that have never been to the area, it was just ok."
3,ruthless editing needed,"I agree with Groundpounder John:""Eric Blehm's account of the life and subsequent search for NPS Ranger Randy Morgenson is a quality piece journalism, part biography, part mystery. For the most part Blehm accomplished what he sent out to do, but the book would have benefited from a more ruthless editor."""
5,EST.IN 1996 MID WEST MAFIA 10/5 St.clair superior,I REMEMBER WHEN THIS CAME OUT I WAS 16 AND STILL LIVIN AT HOME AND WOULD HEAR ON THE RADIO AND WANTED THERE CD BUT COULDNT NEVER FIND IT UNTIL 2004 AND FINALLY I GOT BUT I ENDED UP GIVIN TO MY BROTHER IN LAW LIKE A FOOL BUT I WISH WOULD OF KEPT IT BUT ITS OUT OF PRINT AND AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS IT IF YOU FIND THE ORGINAL COPY MAKE SURE U KEEP IT Peace 1 luv KENDRICK
4,Very Good,I bought this book for a library. It has a lot of information about historical motorcycles and how they were conceived.
4,Product was good,"Bought these for my niece because she could no longer find them at our local store. After comparing prices,this was a good deal for the double pack."
2,got defected item,"I ordered it THROUGH Amazon...I didnt check the nipple and sterlized it and give it to my son. he was keep sucking for half an hour but couldnt finish the milk and atlast he started crying. then I checked and noted that there wasnt hole in the nipple at all..poor my son then I check the second one and it had the same problem. I was so pissed off because my 2 month baby was struggling to drink the milk and atlast he got tired and cried and fall back to sleep without even drinking milk :(...I had bought one before and it was good , it looks like I got the defected one this time."
2,not working,"I've bought these in the store many times and they work great, but for some reason these that I bought on amazon don't work. The hole is so small that no milk will come out. My other slow-flow nipples do one drop per second. I tried to stretch out the hole but it closes back up every time. They were also a very odd orange color instead of brown like the others. Maybe it was a bad batch or something."
1,Too fast! Baby chokes on milk.,"Finding the right Playtex nipples has been like a Goldilocks and the Three Bears experience for me. The latex Playtex slow flow NaturaLatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast. My nearly 3 month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast. When super hungry he can chug a 4 1/2 oz bottle in 5 minutes with the slow flow latex version. So I tried these silicone NaturaLatch slow flows and they are way too slow. My baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow. It took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a 4 1/2 oz bottle! There needs to be some middle ground. Since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow, I tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast. Strangely enough I found that the Playtex Orthodontic Latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed, but the shape of the nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops. Playtex needs to work on improving the nipple flows."
5,Work great for picky breastfed babies,When we found out we were adding a new bundle of joy to the family we immediately knew what bottles we were going to use. We have used and loved the playtex system with all our kids so it was a no brainer. I have mostly breastfed her since birth but she does get a nightly bottle from daddy. She will only take the latex natural latch nipples. Won't have anything to do with the silicone ones. She seems to prefer them because of the texture I think. They are great for breastfed babies. So if your having an issues getting your breastfed baby to take a bottle maybe give a latex nipple a try.Thank you amazon.com for continuing to carry such nessecary yet hard to find items like these nipples!
1,Not even these will work!,"I've gone back to work and not even these nipples are ""natural"" enough to make my daughter stop refusing a bottle! The nipples are thrice as long as my own. The textured ring is barely noticeable! Hardly a comparison to a real nipple."
4,Works great for my daughter,"I read the reviews for these particular nipples. It seems that the common complaint is that the holes are not a consistent size, which is true. They are not. However, my daughter has done wonderful on these nipples. I just marked the ones that had a faster flow and set those aside for later use as she gets bigger. I already had the Drop-in nurser bottles from my son and I wasn't about to spend more money on new bottles if the latex nipples worked. It is a little frustrating but for me it was worth the time and money saved to figure out which nipples had the right size hole."
2,Mismatched pair but could be nice...,"I received a mismatched pair of inserts. The left one is quite thick with fur while the right one is sparse and only about half as thick as the left one. Also, there is a thick seam of folded fur that sits right beneath your toes. It's disappointing because if they were both like the left one and the seam wasn't there they would otherwise be a nice pair of inserts. I washed them once and they held up well but I won't be using them."
3,replacement insoles,"Nice Insole ,but I ordered a wm -sz 7. Received Men's sz 6, not the same thing. You can order uggs replacement soles for $15-better insole."
3,"""experimental folk-jazz""?","I don't really know how to decribe this one, but I like it. There are times when some of the tracks seem like noodly filler, but others are a soothing chill out blend of female vocals, synthy keyboards and percussion, and clarinet. I fully expect great(er) things from this duo in the future..."
4,Wonderful Tactics Introduction And Review,"Great for introducing and reviewing tactical chess, this book provides numerous practical examples. The author outlines the themes and motifs of the standard tactical tricks that every player must be aware of if he intends to improve. I appreciated the author's combination of explanations and testing. I think that any player wishing to review their tactical abilities should consider this book."
5,A Dog's Cloud 9,"I purchased this bed for my dog who weighs about 80 pounds. He has plenty of room to stretch his full length (or curl around)in this nicely padded bed. Amazingly, when I first laid this bed on the floor, my dog immediately stepped into the bed and literally melted. I have never seen him so completely relaxed and unbelievably comfortable. Needless to say, the bed is very special to him, and everytime he steps in, he doesn't waste a minute of nap time."
4,What a voice!,"I thank God that I have had the opportunity to hear this woman sing. She is a beautiful woman with an even more beautiful voice. I saw her PBS special and it really rocked! If you like great music, then u will love this. I rated it 4 stars because even though I love the songs, the majority of them are in French and that is something I dont understand, haha. But they are beautiful songs, even if you dont know the language."
2,shouting...,"A very powerful voice, but may be exagerated ... One could have expected, in spite of this exercise for voice, some sincerity or something. The voice is not smooth enough to be as a diva, and too sophisticated to be for popular songs... But of course one can like this way of singing, and then i think this is a very good record to buy then."
3,Needs salt.,"Interesting enough film, but felt like it had been dehydrated somehow. In the first half you get the tedium of the research process for new flavors and dishes that goes on in the six months when the restaurant is closed, but little insight into what they're actually creating.. In the second half, you get the hustle and bustle and controlled chaos of the kitchen when the restaurant is open, as well as the pleasure of watching the chef Ferran Adrià sample and evaluate the dishes. It was a potentially very interesting subject, but this documentary wasn't able to provide me with any aha! moment."
2,Bland Rubbish,"Two good songs-""Cool Change"" and and the one with the chorus ""Hurry don't be late""Otherwise forgettable."
2,Great Music! CD doesn't work in many players,These songs take me back and are all top hits! It should be noted that the CD will not play in some players. Some copy protected thing I guess. It would be nice if Amazon would list the players that don't work with these CDs so we could make a better buying decision. 2 stars for the player problems. 5 stars fot the music.
5,Great songs from a great band,"I've enjoyed the CD from the day I received it, it's well worth the money"
4,This stroller kicks butt for the money,"Bought this nearly 2 years ago when our second son was born. I will never go back to a regular stroller again.Though it can be a pain to transport, it's a must have if going to anywhere outdoors where a stroller is needed. It gets across all kinds of terrain with ease. No swivel for the front wheel so if you are making a turn you have to lean the whole thing back onto the rear wheels, but it's really sturdy for jogging etc (I rollerskate while pushing little Max around in his). Compared to the super pricey terrain/jogging strollers out there this one is the bomb."
2,I just hope it holds out before she outgrows it!,"Ugh! I spent so much time trying to find a decent and not too expensive all-terrain stroller. However, I now kick myself for not getting one with a front wheel that is not locked. We are always hiking and I thought the bigger the tires the better, but that is definitely not the case. It is horrible to steer. The tires are always flat and the rims have rusted almost completely. My daughter bangs her head on the side bars, so I have to strategically place a blanket around the back. The seat belt has buckles that are hard to snap and I always pinch my hands buckling my daughter in. The straps are not meant for a small child. Even with my daughter at two years old, I have to have the straps cinched down as far as they will go and she can still pull out of them."
3,"Decent stroller, but problematic wheels and folding mechanism","This is a pretty basic jogging stroller. It has no bells and whistles, but does its job for the most part. That said, I've had issues with all 3 wheels being uneven and warped (both rims and tires), which causes the stroller to run anything but smoothly. It feels bumpy and pulls into one direction.Then the mechanism to fold it didn't work any more (after 6 months) and I had to take this thing apart and figure out how to fix it.I'm not sure I'd buy this stroller again; maybe I'd spend a little more money and get a more reliable, higher quality one."
4,"Good stroller, even for walking","I am not a ""jogger"" or runner, but this stroller is good also for walking. The one downside (for walking) is that the fixed front wheel means that I have to tilt the stroller in order to turn the stroller's direction, but the stroller seems durable. The back of the stroller seat is also leaned back a bit further (even at its most upright position) than looks comfortable for my child, but it isn't that big of a deal. The shade does a pretty good job of covering my child."
4,"Wow--Great job, Amazon!","I ordered my InStep Run Around Stroller on May 10, standard FREE shipping. It arrived this afternoon, May 13. Wow Amazon--you rock! The stroller was super easy to assemble. The wheels come off in a snap. The stroller is really solid feeling, and the tires are inflatable like a bike, so the ride will be smooth. It's a very pretty stroller and for 99.00 dollars, I think it's a great value. It is very smooth handling and I think the venting and visor are both very adequate for a child under 50 pounds. I will have to get a head support type pillow, but I'm satisfied with how far the seat reclines and will the storage containers. All in all, I think that this is a great deal. I gave 4 stars only because it's pretty big and I had to take the front wheel off to store it in the trunk of my Volvo S40. I'm very satisfied with the product and amazed at the service. Very satisfied customer."
3,Not Amazing,"Received this as a gift and it came right out of the box with damaged front tire. The seller was excellent though and the tire was replaced within a few days. The brake on the front tire work okay but needs fine tuning adjustment all the time so we have left in unattached most of the time. With the exception of these complaints, the stroller works well and is a nice upgrade. This makes jogging or long walks much easier."
3,needs a head cushion,Very happy with stroller except for the lack of head rest. My son's head hits a bar in the back of the seat. There needs to be some sort of padding there. We have to roll up a towel or blanket to make it comfortable for him. Other than that the stroller rides smooth and is easy to push.
5,Love this stroller.,"If you're used to a regular 4 wheel stroller than it may seem a little awkward at first. Once you get the hang of it, you'll love it. I love that it has 2 baskets underneath and 2 cup holders on top, one for me & one for my 2 year old. It rides smooth and that's great for when they fall asleep. I had some problems at first when it was steering to the left. So I checked the tire pressure like it said in the instructions and that fixed it. I have mostly used it on paved roads. A few times I took it on dirt hiking trails & it still seemed to ride smooth except when I tried to go over some rocks. Then it seemed too bouncy for baby. So I don't recommend rugged terrain. I know Instep is a great brand because my friend had an older model that she let me use until I got a newer one. It lasted her 5 years and 2 kids!"
4,Nice simple jogger,"I wanted a light and simple jogger without all the extra fuss, and that is what I got. It is very sturdy and seems to be well built - it has survived long jogs on rural farming roads! If you are looking for amenities, this probably isn't the stroller for you. It doesn't negotiate sharp turns well at all, so I wouldn't advise taking it to the mall or the grocery store, but it is an awesome stroller for getting out and getting some exercise."
3,could be better,"The jogger has an alignment problem and the fixed wheel idea is terrible ,you have to lift it in order turn."
4,Happy but would upgrade,"The stroller arrived very quickly and the quality is very nice for the money. In hindsight, I would spend the extra $$ for the front wheel to swivel. Overall, the product is what we needed and my daughter always falls asleep when we are walking."
4,Thoroughly Charming Autobiography/Travelogue,"Revered British actor Bogarde narrates this utterly fascinating and highly readible story of his later years, living in the French countryside...working in the final film projects of his distinguished career...and attending to the needs of himself and his aging companion.Beautifully, lyrically written it seemlessly segues from flamboyant prose about life in the country to a serious, evocative chronicle about the love of life and the journey entailed when faced with its end.Timeless and touching. A great read."
5,CMJ says it best...,"KNOBS: Happy, Sad, DrunkThe Knobs approach music making as just another way to enjoy their record collection. Enthusiastic nods to the three Bs of basement classic pop - Beatles, Beach Boys and Big Star - are all over Happy, Sad, Drunk, and it's quite evident the band's enjoying every minute of its sendup. But like Guided By Voices, the Knobs have a way of blending these influences with the working class sentiments of a `90s basement rock band who's dug on a good college record or two, tempering its more sweeping pop craftsmanship with the occasional rawer, off-the-cuff guitar squeak or modern studio trick. The resultant collection plays like that great lost pop record that you can't really pinpoint - was the band at the bar last night playing that tune, or is this song from some old record you heard coming from your older brother's room in 1974? Fitting the criteria: ""Moving,"" ""Turn Down The Sound,"" ""Story Of Destruction"" and ""Carpeted Night.""- Colin Helms: CMJ New Music Report"
1,My cats don't like it and my Vet doesn't recommend it,"My cat was sick and not eating well so I bought this on advice of a coworker after my cat had gotten a force feeding and meds from the Vet. She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done. I asked my Vet what the major difference was between cat milk and people milk, she said they are basically the same but cats milk has taurine added to it, a nutrient that cats need more of. The vet recommended to give the cat regular milk and a taurine supplement if she would eat that. Luckily, after second force feeding she started eating again so I didn't need to go that route. My Vet said that cat milk is way over priced for what you get,"
4,IT WAS OKAY,"HIGH TIDE WAS AN OKAY FEAR STREET SUPER CHILLER. A BOY IS A MAIN CHARACTER, SO THAT'S COOL. AND THE KILLER IS A BIG SURPRISE! HIGH TIDE WAS A GOOD BOOK BUT NOT SCARY. MY FAVORITE PART IS THE BEGINNING. THAT WAS AWESOME!"
2,it isn't very good!!,This book HIGH TIDE was not very good and i think it was boring. usually i can't wait to finish a book but this one i don't even want to finish it. I read to the middle and it was one of the worst books i think i've read by him and i have read atleast 70 of his books. it it not scary at all!!
4,Great book,This book is really good. Its a bit suprising who the killer is though you wouldnt guess it in a million years. Not the best fear street book but definetly worth a look at
5,Best CD of 2005!!,"This is the best CD of 2005 hands down. The singer reminds me of Brian Howe when he was with Bad Company (1986-1993). This cd makes you feel good inside after you hear it. It will truely amaze you. Standout songs are every song on the album. There are no fillers to bore you. The musicianship & songwriting far exceed anything on the radio that is selling millions and millions of copies in major retail stores. If you love AOR, Hard Rock, Melodic Metal or Hair Metal of today or the past, this CD is for you. Don't miss getting a copy for yourself & see why everyone thinks it is 2005 CD of the year in it's genre."
5,As good if not better than classic melodic rock,"Great vocals!Great lyrics and melodies.Top notch instrumentals, tracks & production.Great hard driving rock beat and not an old re-hash of what has already been done by bands like Journey, but all new material that is of the same excellent quality.THANK YOU LE BLANC BROTHERS!"
5,The best,"The best cd of 2005 by far, if you are a fan of Reo Speedwagon, survivor, styx, Journey , you have to by this cd NOW. Simply the best."
3,decent movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It was well acted and it was fun to watch the tanks running around. The U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer actually made a decent looking Panther after strategically placed sheet metal was applied. It does, however, come up short in accuracy as most war movies do. References to the Panther being armed with an 88mm gun were one inaccuracy (75mm is correct). Another was the arrival of the Pershing heavy tank in September 1944 just in time for the breaching of the German frontier (20 arrived in March 1945). And, of course, the German general who the tankers capture is far too young to have held that rank. Ont he other hand, being it was made in '51 in Black-and-White, the war footage inserted into the movie doesn't look too much out of sorts. If you can over look the inaccuracy, its a pretty good movie."
2,"Just the main points, please!","I'm taking a research methods course right now and, unfortunately, this is the book that was assigned. The chapters are too long and the authors make things more complex by trying to include too many examples and unnecessary filler material. Research methods is boring anyway, but Rubin and Babbie make learning about it more boring and confusing by not getting straight to the point. I have a ""quiz"" next week and you don't know how tedious it is read through these chapters. I had to learn how to speed read in order to save time and find the important information.Thank goodness the book is at least organized."
1,Difficult to read,"This book is really long winded and boring. It rambles a lot and is quite incoherent, though I would give it some credit for trying to sound personable. The chapter on inferential statistics, especially isn't very clear which makes it even more frustrating because stats is already quite a dry topic."
1,Not the greatest,"I am taking a graduate level social work research course right now. This book is not the best. Instead of coming directly to the point, and concisely summarizing each concept, the authors overwhelm each concept with words. There are definitely better books out there for research. This book is not recommended for those just entering research."
3,instructor's book,The book pictured on the web page is not the book I received. I received the instuctors version. It seems to match the student's copy so I guess I'm okay.
1,cannot say,"I personally can not give a review on this pictular book. Because I never recieved it. I ordered it however, it never came. I have many others I have recieved from Amazon which I would recommend.Sorry, Iam no help on ths one."
1,not what it said,"I ordered this textbook ""like new""..it came with with first 3 chapters water damaged (but still readable) and the front and back covers had both broken off their binding. I would not call that ""like new""."
4,I got it within 10 days. A very clean book.,The book is very new and I got it within 10 days. Pleased having it.
3,One Good Singer and Other Mediocre Ones,"There is more than one singer on this tribute album. The man singing ""Grown Men Don't Cry,"" ""Red Ragtop,"" and ""Watch the Wind Blow By"" is wonderful and should release his own albums. He is very talented. The other singers are mediocre, and they bring down the whole album. There aren't any other listenable tracks accept for ""Not a Moment too Soon."""
1,What a waste,"there is only one funny part in this movie, it is a bad remax of American Pie which I loved. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Nice but hard to read,"Liked the idea of it, but in practive have found it hard to read the time or numbers, maybe I am just getting old :-)Also at night, too thin of an arms stop you from seeing teh time, which is not good given the baby is up at all hours."
1,"HOW NOT TO CHOOSE, THE WRONG WATCH, JUDGING QUALITY BY A BRAND NAME.","Upon reciving the time piece,i juged that everything,was allright.One week later i left home in P R and came to TAMPA for Surgey while checking the time in the PLANE i notticed that the neddle that marks the day of the week was hanging loose next to the marker for 10(A.M). please advive on how to proceed,to get my money back, and return this item at once."
1,The sound of Italy.,"I recently started watching foreign movies and thought I would try an Italian show. I found it very difficult to listened to Italian.I dont have a problem with the sub-titles. But the sound of Italian is too harsh. I prefer, Swedish or French. I could not watch it for long. Maybe next time I'll mute the sound. Wow What an idea!!!"
3,Early Putt-Putt game,"It's not the best Putt-Putt game but the kids have enjoyed it either way. It's not as advanced graphically as the newer ones but it's a good start and if your kids love Putt-Putt, it's a good addition to your collection. They learn colors, memory, shapes, etc. All 3 of my children play and enjoy it. Ages 7, 5 and 3."
2,Tiny bag,"I wanted this to hold a CD player while walking the dog and thought that, with the given dimensions, it would work, but it is tiny! Returned to Amazon."
2,Worthless for running,I thought after reading other reviews this would be a good pack to carry my iPhone while running. Boy was I wrong! While it fits my iPhone just fine (couldn't get anything else in it though) it would not stay secure on my waist and continued to bounce around constantly. I kept having to stop running and push it back down to secure it near my hips and then when I began to run again it became dislodged and bounced up around my chest. It was so annoying that I finally took the thing off and carried it in my hand for the rest of my run. One of the problems is that the straps are not elastic and I think this contributes to the problem. I gave it two stars because it is pretty.
4,mamaknowsbest,"i'm grateful to have something to take with me while jogging, but it doesn't get small enough to fit snuggly around my waist so it sort of bounces around a bit when i jog. otherwise it is perfect."
2,"tiny, tiny, tiny","I have to qualify this review with the fact that I'm not a runner. I bought it to carry my wallet, balance bar, and cell while I ride my bike. I won't do that. Only the cell and the balance bar fit. The usable space inside is about the size a wallet. There was a larger version available and I wish I'd purchased that one. I think it would have done the job. It is lightweight and well assembled though the mess on the outside pocket seems thin though it never broke when my cell antenna was pushing against it."
3,Small,I bought this to carry keys and cell phone. You can only carry one. It is small If you only want to carry a cell phone it is great. If your wallet is fat it will not fit either.
3,Very small,It works for me but it's very small. I wish it was little larger. My I phone w cover is tightly fit. No room for any thing else.
3,Not the best remix package,"Having already remixes part 4 at home, I decided to obtain part 3. Unfortunately this one is not as good as the other one. Probably an amazing gift for a die-for-fan, but a pink elephant for a casual listener.Cd-1 weak points are songs 2, 9, 8.Cd-2 songs 8, 9 are the flows.I am still considering whether I sell it or keep it."
5,EXCELLENT BEST OF CD,Track Listing1. I Should Be So Lucky2. Got To Be Certain3. The Loco Motion4. Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi5. Especially For You6. Turn It Into Love7. It's No Secret8. Hand On Your Heart9. Wouldn'T Change A Thing10. Never Too Late11. Tears On My Pillow12. Better The Devil You Know13. Step Back In Time14. What Do I Have To Do?15. Shocked16. Word Is Out17. If You Were With Me Now18. Give Me Just A Little More19. Finer Feelings20. What Kind Of Fool (Heard All That Before)21. Where In The World?22. Celebration
3,I like it!,"This album seems to get put down alot, but I think that's only because it followed the huge ""Starfish"" album, and often got compared to that. Taken on it's own, it's a typical, yet really good ""Church"" album. ""Metropolis"" and ""You're Still Beautiful"" were the two almost hits, but I enjoy some of the others just as much. The tracks ""City"", ""Laughing"", and ""Grind"" are all excellent, and are some of my favorite songs of theirs. One word of warning, the vinyl of ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" drops a couple tracks, but the cassette and cd include them all. Newcomers might just want the ""Best Of"" or ""Starfish"", but all fans should check this one out."
4,"Not quite a ""Starfish""","The Church followed up their best album, ""Starfish,"" with one that covers similar ground but is not as consistently good. There are still a lot of dreamy guitars and oblique lyrics (think of a happier, mellower Velvet Underground). The best songs are the single ""Metropoplis"" the haunting closer ""Grind"" and the easy rocking ""Laughing."" Not a classic, but a good solid album nonetheless."
3,OK But Not Great,"I'll buy anything these guys put out without ever having heard it ... but when I saw the album I thought ""oh no, they're trying to look like U2 on the cover - what does this mean for the music inside?"". Unfortunately the contents of the album are fairly patchy, mixing some obvious attempts at singles with more ambitious stuff which pre-empts their mid 90's experimental sound. I suspect that the context of the album - trying to follow up the surprising commercial success of Starfish - meant that they tried to please themselves AND the record company and succeeded with neither. My overall feeling about the album is that it is largely forgettable and deserves a ranking towards the bottom of their excellent catalogue. Now if you want to hear a fantastic Church album buy the recently released Hologram of Baal ...."
4,Great Album,"I'm not currently sleeping with the band,so I will refrain from getting involved inthe band's personal lives.In regard to the album, it is a Church Classic;With tunes such as Metropolis, Terra Nova Cain, andYour Still Beautiful. -Pack a bowl and play-"
3,worth your time,"this is a good cd by The Church. but compared to their other releases, this one suffers in some ways. for one thing, there are just too many songs on here to really get a complete grasp of the album. by the time you get to the 8th track, you feel like you're hearing the same song a few times. a bit more quality control would have greatly benefited this album. the cover also is...(unintentionally) funny. but there are some really really good songs on here. the first song ""Pharoah"" is classic Church with haunting melodies and great guitar work. ""Grind"" and ""You're Still Beautiful"" retain that sharp edge with good songwriting. but overall...this should probably be bought from the ""used"" bin at your record store, if you can find it."
4,Great Song,I like this song a bunch! It will get ya up and dancing every time you listen to it! There is only one thing wrong with this song...WHAT IS HER NAME? You'll never know just by listeninhg to the song!
3,"Ok, but not great","I got this item because it was cheaper than all the other CAT6 cables, and I guess I got what i paid for. Usually, ethernet cables have a thick coating on them. This one seems to have a very thin coating and you can feel all the wiring guts through the casing. I haven't used it yet, and I'm sure it works fine, but the casing just seems flimsy.Update: The cable may seem flimsy, but it works fine. No complaints."
1,Target Practice,"That is what this book should be used for--target practice. Not a single tale is remotely bloodcurdling. More than a dozen yawns went unsurpressed while attemptly with foolhardy optimism to complete this pedestrian compilation. Why stifle a yawn, that'll kill ya. STAY AWAY!"
5,Journalistic Fraud: How the New York Times Distorts the News,"This is a must read for anyone interested in true reporting. The book should be required reading at all journalism schools and should be read by all Americans. Now you can read the New York Times and spot reporters' obvious slanting of any news they do not agree with or that does not fit with their agenda. To coin the cutesy phrases Maureen Dowd is so fond of using: Dowdy and Richie Rich along with ""rotten"" Apple cannot be relied upon to deliver accurate news pieces -- they are so obviously tainted by their liberal (make that ULTRA liberal) viewpoints that nothing short of their view is worth reporting."
1,This man is a joke.,"As anyone who watches Scarborough Country on MSNBC can tell you, this man has zero credibility. He regularly gets caught on air lying and making up and distorting facts. He is also prone to outrageous temper tantrums that would make the most ill-behaved child embarrassed to watch.Based on the man's questionable character, the chances aren't very good that this book has any sort of factual basis whatsoever.There is a reason this book is selling for thrity-two cents."
3,Better than other efforts,"Kohn does a decent job of finding examples to support the thesis he is trying to prove, that the New York Times systematically slants the news. I remain unconvinced, but he's made a good try.If you're inclined to believe a liberal bias in the Times specifcally, and want to explore the question further, this is a far better book than Ann Coulter's hysterical, deceptive, error-ridden ""Slander."" I recommend you also read Eric Alterman's ""What Liberal Media?"" to round out your perspective.I came away from Kohn's book stil believing that bias in the eye of the beholder. Conservatives seem to believe that any news outlet that fails to support a conserative view is liberal. Many of Kohn's examples didn't seem slanted to me; with others I could see how they could be taken that way even if they weren't intended to. But if you already think the bias exists, the book will give you some ammunition."
1,veteran journalist Bob Baker,"Kohn took a cheap shot at me in this book and if that represents the intellectual level of the work as a whole, we're all in trouble. In ""Newsthinking,"" a book on mental organization for journalist, I urge writers to seek out new and vibrant forms of structure to tell a story once they have reported it. In doing this, I cite Rule Number One: There Are No Rules, an edit aimed at craftmanship, not disregarding the truth. Kohn, to fit his purpose, interpreted Rule Number One as urging reporters to abandon rules of truth and fairness if twisting the facts made a better story. It is impossible to read ""Newsthinking"" in context and glean that. As a reporter and editor with 34 years in the business, it angered me have my words twisted in a way I would never tolerate or advocate. Kohn did precisely what he tried to condemn."
1,he got it backwards,"to get straight to the point, the conclusion is largely correct--the NYT is not an unbiased source of news. the premise, however is incorrect. the paper actually has been quite often on bended knee regarding this conservative (actually quite radical) administration, using judith miller to propagate the lies regarding iraq promoted by that administration favorite, and convicted embezzler, ahmed chalabi. these fibs were among the many used to justify the invasion of a harmless country, albeit ruled by a cruel dictator long supported by the US, esp. during the period of the greatest human rights violations, during the Reagan and Bush I administrations. this is but one small example. the op-ed pieces by Safire and Freidman, taken as a whole, are another. do you really want reliable, honest news? If so read the Nation, Harpers, The American Prospect, etc. Listen to Democracy Now for starters. Then reread this book from a more enlightened perspective."
2,Gave Me Headaches and Made Me Lethargic,"Every time I took a pill, I got a bad headache and wanted to go to sleep right away. For hours, I had to try hard to keep my eyes open and stay alert. My urine also became bright yellow after taking this. Those side effects are probably due to too large dosage of certain vitamins/minerals in the pill, the quality of which are possible not good either."
3,Not a good addition to the WS Collection unless you collect them!,"I honestly was surprised by this book. I own a lot of the other Williams-Sonoma Collection books and this one seems rather futile. I haven't used it once actually. I browsed through and realized that it doesn't have many sauce recipes, not all ones you'd be thinking of either (like some basic ones). I was a bit disappointed in the content. Most Williams-Sonoma cookbooks have sauce recipes that go with the featured recipe so don't bother buying this special volume unless you want the whole collection."
4,Sauces,"This is a well written book with execllent photography, one would consider buying this to learn how to make the basic (mother) sauces as well as the newer sauces.Also it's actually a great cook book too."
5,Awesome pictures and great staple sauce recipes!,Great book I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas. He is very in to cooking and this book has fantastic pictures and recipes! So far we've tried 4 recipes and they have all turned out great :)
5,If you love sauces- buy this!,"I'm a classically trained chef who loves making sauces. They complete a meal- and sometimes, they even make the meal! This book was everything I'd hoped it would be, and I'm excited by the sauces offered here. Although I already know how to make many of them, this book offers recipes that coincide with each sauce. It's great for people who don't know much about sauces, but would like to and would also like to have some ideas of what to pair with each sauce.Williams Sonoma does a great job of taking the fear out of making a good sauce. It's really as easy as they say.The pictures are nice, the book is good quality and it's become a staple among my large collection of cookbooks."
2,This is not the Lettermen CD to buy ......,"The 1960's Lettermen recordings are terrific, but like the other reviews said, there are better values."
1,I grew up with the Lettermen,"Title is misleading. It does NOT include their greatest hits and does include some tunes I've never heard of. The CD is remastered and the quality of the sound is poor. If you want the real ""greatest hits"", buy the All-Time Greatest Hits CD."
5,A Holiday Classic!,"One of my top holiday classics. If you are looking for a Christmas movie but do not want to drag down by emotion and sentiment, this is your best choice!"
5,Classic Holiday Movie!,We love this movie! This is our second order; we'd had it long ago as a VHS tape.Just Hilarious.
5,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Great movie! I had to buy it again, because the original one got misplaced,(must of been the divorce thing)My Daughter loves that movie, its a holiday tradition to watch it every year, so I bought it for her for one of her Christmas gifts."
4,Our favorite Christmas movie!,"We have spent many a Christmas with the Griswolds and never tire of their hilarious antics! Our favotite parts are ""The Icicle Scene"" and ""The Squirrel Scene"". And that poor kitty cat! This movie is fun for the whole family but be aware there is some adult humor that may not be too appropriate for younger kids. It's just not Christmas without the Griswolds!"
5,Deck the halls with howls of laughter!,"One of my favorite Xmas movies! Clark Griswold wants to have an old-fashioned family christmas, so I'll stand back if i were you. the laughs come fast and furious in this movie, even the opening animation bit is funny."
5,Christmas Favorite,"What is not to love about this classic. Funny no matter how many times you see it. Clark is like all of us, just wants to do the right thing and make great memories. And like for the rest of us, things just never work out as planned, but they do work out. LOVE this movie."
4,It's That Time of Year,"Here it is, Christmas time again. In addition to the egg nog and rest of the season, it is time to watch Christmas Vacation for the umpteenth time. I actually struggled over how many stars to give this film. Let's face it, the movie is not Casablanca; however, it is just so hilarious in parts, that I can't help but be entertained. There are some hilarious moments in this film. These go hand in hand with some of the more inappropriate and gross jokes and sight gags. There are also a couple of downright poignant moments like when Clark AKA Sparky is up in the attic watching old home movies. There have been many pretenders; such as the recently awful Deck the Halls, but for the true Holiday comedy classic, you can't go wrong with Christmas Vacation."
5,A Christmas Tradtion,"This is the basis of our annual Christmas movie watching, we watch this movie every year and it's one of our favorites. It's a good family comedy movie that gets everyone in a good mood. Chevy Chase does an awesome job as the lead character and Randy Quaid as the unwelcome family member is always a great twist. The Griswalds just want a great all American family Christmas with the entire family present and enjoying each other. Just one thing after another seems to sabotage that hope in a funny change of events."
3,Hardly HD,"I rushed to throw this disc in my HDDVD player only to be horribly disappointed. The other guy that reviewed this title today should get his eyes checked. This is the exact video quality as is on the standard dvd, which I also own. It is not remastered at all. Save your money and buy the standard dvd if you want this title.This movie was obviously rushed onto HDDVD just in time to take advantage of consumers for the holiday season. I feel absolutely ripped off.The 3 stars is solely because this is a great movie, and also one of the worst HDDVD transfers I've seen so far."
3,Clark Griswald has a five-alarm fun-filled family christmas,"Ever since Clark (Chevy Chase) was a young boy he wanted to host a fun-filled family Christmas. This year he takes things too far with exploding Christmas trees, dogs, squirrels, and lights, lights, lights. Finale includes police, swat teams, and a winebago. One of the best scenes is where Clark goes for the world amatuer saucer-sled land speed record using a new kitchen lubricant his company has invented. A must see for the holidays and a classic 'B' movie. My wife's favorite holiday classic."
5,Don't throw me down Clark,"""I'll try not to.""Classic. Its a miracle I don't wet myself everytime I see this its so funny. I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan, but in this, he makes everything click.I love the yuppie neighbors who are constantly being sarcastic with each other. Makes you realize that as nuts as the Grizwalds are, the world is worse."
3,Good but Wasn't Rusty older than Audrey in the first movie?,Funny and a lot more family friendly than the first Vacation movie which had an R rating. Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that Rusty seemed to have gotten younger and Audrey older? In the first movie wasn't Rusty who was played by Anthony Michael Hall actually older than Audrey who was played by Dana Barron? Minor thing but it's just something I've always wondered about since first seeing National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.
5,Classic,"no better classic checy chase movie ever, best christmas movie ever, can watch this over and over and do every year, the hell with christmas story tnt run this ona loop every christmas"
1,Blah,There is really no point or plot to this film. I would recommend that you go make some hot chocolate and play Monopoly instead of wasting your time on this film.
1,CHRISTMAS VACATION - WON'T PLAY,"I ORDERED THIS ""HD"" VERSION OF CHRISTMAS VACATION BECAUSE I HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED A DVD HD UPCONVERTER PLAYER FOR MY NEW HD TV. I COULDN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIE IN TRUE HD. WHEN I INSERTED THE DISC INTO THE DVD PLAYER, I DISCOVERED IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AN ""UP CONVERTER HDMI"" DVD PLAYER. DUE TO AMAZON'S POLICY, THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO RETURN A DVD IN AN OPENED PACKAGE. NOW I'M OUT $20.00 BUCKS FOR A USELESS ITEM. PLEASE LEARN MY LESSON....KNOW YOUR SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES BEFORE YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE."
1,Watch out for soft porn. :o(,"I'm all for silly movies, especially holiday themed ones that are just plain goofy. But the scene where Clark lies to the sexy mall clerk, saying he's divorced, as he drools over her breasts... then his son walks up as he literally looking up the woman's thigh and picking up on her. C'mon. That's not funny, that's sad. And later Clark fantasizes over this same woman (we get the view of him visualizing her showing up) at his new backyard pool and we get to see a very revealing strip tease? How is this family-friendly comedy? The pool scene really crossed the line. If this were'nt a movie for kids and family I wouldn't care, but how can you target that audience and then show scenes like that? Very poor taste in my opinion."

1,"Love the movie, but never received my DVD","I never recieved the DVD that I ordered!! I will never order from amazon again, and if I do never this seller!"
2,"Love the movie, hate the DVD","Will all of the reissue of old movies with enhanced features for DVD, why would this disc be released I the same format as the VHS release. I think this is one of the funniest movies around, but the DVD release should have included a wide screen version and restored the missing scenes. There are screen shots on the DVD jacket that are not even on the DVD version. I was very disappointed..."
1,"Really, really dumb.","I can't tell you how disappointed we all were by this. Everyone says it's just such a classic, but the three of us all agreed it was really lame. A couple of chuckles and that's it. Rampaging squirrels and exploding sewer gas? That's all ya got? No where near as good as Caddy Shack, Ghostbusters, Planes Trains and Automobiles, etc."
3,Great movie but far from Hi-Def Quality Video,"I'm only rating the quality of the Blu Ray here (the movie is a true 5-star classic!), as I found the video quality on the Blu Ray to be quite poor. Very grainy and you can really see a lot of the flaws in the original film recording. I know the producers can only do so-much to improve upon a movie that was not filmed in Hi-Def, but there are movies from the same era (like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles) that are superior in video and audio quality on Blu Ray. I think they needed to spend more time remastering the original film for Blu Ray."
5,Classic movie,"The Chevy Chase lampoons are by far the best, and this one is just as funny as National Lampoons Vacation."
4,Classic movie! No better Christmas movie!,"If you have never seen this movie, it is a must see. There has never been one to match it. Great Christmas day movie.Amazon Unbox was easy to download and watch this movie. I even hooked up my computer to my TV and watched it on my 46 inch Widescreen TV."
4,"Weaker than the others, but still funny","This isn't the best 'Vacation' by a long shot, but it is still as funny. In fact, it could be the funniest Christmas movie ever."
2,"Picture quality, kind of 'meh'","I'm not sure this was such a good transfer of the film. Secondly if I'd have known it was made in Mexico, using materials I could have done myself at home, I'd have not bought it."
5,funny old movie,This is the revamped 2010 version(I watched it on a new panasonic blu-ray dvd player and plasma tv)and thought that the picture quality was very good.I've heard some people on here say that the picture quality sucked but I had no problems with my copy.the movie is a classic and can be enjoyed by the whole family(my wife even loved this movie)so I guess if you buy this dvd from amazon you should get the 2010 version(there was a 2008 copy going around and I believe that this copy is the crappy picture quality version)so be carefull where or from whom you buy it from(make sure it's the 2010 version and you should be alright)enjoy!it's a funny movie.
5,Great Movie,Bought this to have on hand for a good laugh. There are movies I only watch once but not this one.
4,A Classic in Blu-ray,What you see is what you get. A classic in Blu-ray. We watch this movie every Christmas. It wouldn't be the same without it. The blu-ray quality is nice.
5,A Christmas Classic!,"I remember going with my parents and grandparents to see Christmas Vacation at the theater back in 1989 (Just writing this makes me feel old.). It is the third film out four of the National Lampoon Vacation series and it is the best out of the sequels. It later spawned a spin-off sequel with Cousin Eddie, but it was dreadful to watch. Christmas Vacation is played to death thanks to CMT and Comedy Central. I would rather watch the unedited version on DVD."
5,Non stop laughs,"If you do not laugh during this movie, check your pulse! This is Chevy Chase at his best. A family favorite for decades!!"
4,good for the price.....,I have been pricing the regular dvd but have seen it for no cheaper than 15.99. With this only 4 dollars more it was an easy choice. Some inside scenes and blacks are grainy but that can be expected with the age of the film. But overall it is a good blu-ray and great if you love the movie as much as I do.
3,Low key but personable Griswold action.,"Lower key and perhaps more endearing than its predecessors, this third installment of the Vacation saga finds the Clark W. Griswolds hosting their family for some Christmas fun. Chevy returns as usual as the hapless every-dad family man overseeing his latest `mission' to provide a Christmas that he has never had. The Audrey and Russ turn-over rate continues, this time with Juliette Lewis and the kid from Rosanne. Beverly D'Angelo's Ellen returns, displaying her new face lift, can't even smile fully now, which is a pity. The sight gags remain, but despite the presence of cousin-in-law Randy Quaid, this movie strives for and to some extent succeeds in giving us a more personal, intimate glimpse of Clark and the family dynamics. I wouldn't consider this a classic, and it doesn't take the crown from the first film, but it does improve on the second's dreadful outing."
1,Poor quality,Very poor quality. It looks like someone filmed this while in a movie theater. I purchased this movie years ago but gave it away and thought this was the same copy but it wasn't. Don't order this one.
5,The gift that keeps giving year round!,best christmas movie ever. The gift that keeps giving year round! I watch it every year. highly highly recommended. !!
5,Family classic,"A must for every dysfunctional family. I must have seen this movie 20 times. Since getting rid of my VCR, needed a cd. Love it!"
2,Great expectations,"It had been many years since seeing this movie....and last time was probably a edited for tv version....my wife wanted to get it to have a ""special"" movie night with our grandsons age 8 and 12 when they stayed over holidays with us......yes it is a funny gag movie.....but the language and sexual inference (overt and more subtle both) were offensive to me, much less in showing to our grandsons....I had not recalled such language and offensive imagery (shooting the finger, dogs humping on scene, pool dream scene, etc. etc.) .... if I did, I would have never ordered it ... let buyer beware."
2,"Great movie, not a great DVD.","Make no mistake, the movie is great and is a classic. Very funny, one of the great classics. But the DVD is another story. I would be embarrassed if I was Warner Bros for releasing a DVD like this one. No extras, picture and sound are fair, nothing you would expect for a DVD. No widescreen, just like a vhs tape. But it is a great movie to own, and rather own the DVD than the VHS."
2,not happy with national lampoons christmas vacation,"very disappointed in the quality of the movie.the picture was very dark, hard to see the faces clearly.everyone looked orange with dark shadows on faces i will not be ordering any more videos -national lampoons christmas"
3,NO HAT!,"My husband loves this movie and was excited about getting the collectors edition, but when he opened it Christmas morning there was no hat :("
3,BEST CHRISMAS MOVIE!!! DVD very POOR and dissapointing!,"As youve read on other reviews probly THE MOVIe is great not only is it the best Movie in the Vaction Seris but probly Chevy Chase's best loved by the cerdics and but not such a big hit in the box office but was a top seller on Videos whean it come out at the time.Like I seaid Production NOTES!!!! Whos going to read that!!Theatical Trailers to all 4 of the Vaction Movies.........ATTENTION WARNER BROTHERS come out wiht a Special Editon DVD of the movie.. But I do find the sound quality imporved along with the picture,"
2,"Funny, but way too much foul language for the family.","Chevy Chase is at the height of his game in this installment of National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" series. Be aware that there are many words and situations that are totally inappropriate for kids (and even for some of us adults). It is for this reason I cannot give this movie more than two stars."
1,"CD was broken. :( Didn't realize it, until we went to watch it last night...Christmas eve. Could I get it exchanged please?","It was broken. :( I love this movie and was looking forward to watching it Christmas eve (last night), but when we went to put it in and it didn't work we realized the CD was broken. :("
5,My Favorite Christmas Movie,"I always enjoy a few Christmas movies before Christmas, but this is my absolute favorite. I enjoy the way everything blows up in Clarks face when he thinks he has the best laid plans and his heart is in the right place wanting to make everyone happy. I especially like when he needs an aspirin after a very long rant, as anyone that has done anything similar will be able to relate to the headaches the ranting causes. Absolutely hilarious."
3,"Love the movie, Blu-Ray version weak","This movie is a holiday staple at our house, so I highly recommend it for people who enjoy a little good, old-fashioned, Chevy Chase slapstick humor. The Blu-ray looked in parts like somebody had taken a hi-res camcorder into a movie and tried to hold it as steady as possible. Other parts weren't as shaky, but the image quality was no better than DVD. I'd say I'm disappointed, but my expectations weren't Avatar-level graphics. Still, a great movie."
5,A Holiday Classic,Make watching this movie a Christmas tradition in your home after trimming your own tree! Hilarious from start to conclusion. Fun for all ages. Every family should have a copy.
5,*****,Great movie. Glad I own it so I can watch it whenever even if its not Christmas time it a awesome comedy all year long.
3,Ok Christmas movie to watch with the kids only,"If you watch this alone or with your significant other than you will soon be looking at each other thinking the same thing: ""How Corny!""But the kids will love it!"
5,We watch this every year,This is a Christmas tradition for us and now we can watch it when we want and not have to search to find when it is showing. Our time is now when we choose. Great comedic tradition to the holidays!!
5,Great Holiday movie,This movie is a Christmas classic. It never gets old! Great for getting in the holiday spirit. Chevy Chase at his best
5,A Christmas Classic,"This is one of those movies we used to watch every year when I was a kid and it holds up to the memories. Chevy Chase is HILARIOUS and his ability to dead-pan is perfect; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss in an early role is a scene-stealer and shows some of the talent that would become evident in her TV career, which has netted her multiple Emmy's and countless accolades. I can't think of one scene that doesn't have me laughing hysterically. It is a true classic."
5,Great movie,"A holiday movie recently added to the 'classic' list. Not the funniest of all the National Lampoon's 'Vacation' series, but good for a few good laughs."
5,Must see,"I love watching this movie every year before Christmas; it's a classic! I bought this for our new blue ray player this year, now I can get rid of my VHS copy."
5,Best Christmas Movie Ever,"If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it. It's a classic. I've been watching in for years with my family. We break it out on Thanksgiving and play it repeatedly over the following month.Like some others have said, the DVD version isn't the best quality, but I bought it just because my VHS version had been watched so many times, and for the durability factor. I hope they re-release it some day ""digitally remastered"", or whatever they do. Get this movie and you will not be disappointed."
4,Great DVD,"A Christmas classic must-have! I have always seen this movie on regular TV, so to see it on DVD with the original 'language' was fabulous!"
2,Was not the family movie that I thought it was,"Movie quality was fine. Played well. Arrived within a few days.I saw this years ago when I was a teen. Maybe I watched the TV edited version or something like that cause I didn't remember half the stuff in this movie. Yes it's very funny, but you ought to watch it first before you decide if you'd like your kids to. There's a lot of language and content that not so great for kids. By today's ratings I think this would be an R based on the language alone."
5,Always a Funny Xmas--Classic,"Although it was a little early to watch a Christmas movie, we always laugh with this one. Absolutely, great on BluRay."
5,Holiday Tradition,"If you grew up in the 50s or 60s than you are probably a bigger fan of The Christmas Story, but if you are younger than you can not get better than this. This is Chevy at his best and a great story. There are times when Randy Quaid almost steals the show.One of the things that makes Chevy / Clark so endearing is his innocence. A man who is just trying to give his family a memorable holiday. Thanks to Chevy, he has given my family many memorable laughs."
2,poor quality,"best movie ever! as soon as i realized that this was on blu ray, i immediately purchased it in december. i know this is an old movie, but the quality was horrible. very grainy. not blu ray quality. the regular dvd is about the same quality. disappointed."
5,A classic for the Holiday season,"Yet another in the great Vacation series. The Griswolds have the whole family over for what most would perceive to be the ""A-typical"" Griswold family Christmas. This is a must have for the Christmas season."
2,Blu-Ray. Really??,"First off, let me tell you that I love this movie. It is, quite frankly, the best Christmas movie there is. The comedy is non-stop from beginning to end. This time of year, we watch it 3 or 4 times before Christmas, including on Christmas Eve. Having said that, the Blu-Ray version is no better than the standard DVD. The video is so-so, the audio is terrible (Dolby 2.0), and there are no extras. Maybe I shouldn't expect more, after all, the movie is from 1989. However, in releasing a Blu-Ray, I think people do expect better quality. If you are buying this movie for the first time and can get a good deal on the Blu-Ray, go for it. If you are thinking of replacing the standard DVD with a Blu-Ray, save your money for something else."
3,Not What We Expected,"We love this movie, so we were very excited to receive it as a Christmas present and watch it. However, we didn't catch it was a ""Special Edition"", which means the language is not edited. We didn't realize it would contain some pretty foul language and didn't appreciate it when we were watching it as a family. Love the movie but not this edition!"
5,Movie,It was received in the time. I received the product as described. The price was right. I would order again.
1,If I could give zero star I would,"It would have been okay had Clark been at least a faithful man to his wife. The main character fabricates that he is divorced when he meets a girl at the lingerie shop? A Santa-Clark imagines himself seeing the girl naked as he dreams about the family pool? That makes the man not funny, but clearly treacherous. I found the man to be abominable and the movie to be the same. The lack of fundamental morality undermines the value of this movie, especially as a ""family movie."""
1,Very vulgar and foul movie,The father is a buffoon in picture. There are many lustful scenes and lots of sexual innuendo. The F-bomb is used as well as many other explicative. Not a family picture.
1,Poor audio,"This is one of my favorite movies so I wanted it in Blu Ray. However, the audio on this Blu Ray Disc is only Dolby Digital 2.0, not Dolby Surround Sound. I thought when upgrading to Blu Ray the audio would also be improved. That's why it got only one star. What a disappointment!"
1,Major Disappointment,"I love this movie. I sat down to watch my old DVD 4:3 version and decided it wasn't good enough for my HDTV. I wanted a widescreen HD version. I found this Blu-ray version on Amazon and placed my order. My two complaints: video quality and ""widescreen"". The video quality is slightly better than my DVD at best. The ""widescreen"" was the bigger problem. I assumed this would be a re-release of the original theatrical widescreen version - it isn't. They have actually cropped the top and bottom off of the 4:3 DVD version to make it pseudo-widescreen. My Blu-ray now has less of the original movie than the 4:3 version has - it has been cropped twice. Don't waste your money on this - keep watching the DVD version."
2,Not a decent Family movie especially during Xmas,"A very mediocre movie, selected based on high customer review but was disappointed.Bad jokes and scenes when you are watching with family and kids, negativity amongst family, silly things.Pros: Family stands behind himWould certainly repeat watching movies I liked rather than watch this one.If you just want to kill time, maybe watch it. Nothing you are missing out on."
3,CHEVY CHASES CHRISTMAS,"One can't help but laugh at the shenanigans Chevy Chase goes through in trying to ready his house for the Griswold Family Christmas. While some gags are in questionably good taste, they are funny and Chase has a fine cast of supporting players including Randy Quaid as the redneck Eddie; the parents: John Randolph, Diane Ladd, Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall; and Julia Louis Dreyfus as the snooty neighbor. This was one of my mother's (God rest her soul) favorite Christmas movies because she said it made her laugh, and I guess that's testimony enough to its enduring power."
3,Funny movie--,"Very funny entry in the Vacation series. Everyone here is in slapstick form. Thankfully, John Hughes took over Directing chores after the disasterous Jeremiah Chechick nearly destroyed the film. Funny animated titles (look for Santa's ""privates"" when he's electrocuted on the chimney! ) although the opening song by Cynthia Weill and Barry Mann is TERRIBLE. Angelo Badalamenti's score is great, and I wished he'd have scored the title sequence!"
3,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,It was very good and made me laugh and I enjoyed it except for the language. I think Chevy Chase is very good.
4,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"One of the funniest Christmas Movies I have ever seen!My main beef is that it is not available in Widescreen format. When is everyone going to get it that Widescreen will be the ONLY format one day, all DVD's should automatically have widescreen. End of Discussion!"
4,Becoming a Christmas classic,"I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago, and tried to catch it yearly around the holidays on regular TV, now I have my own copy and love it.so funny!"
5,Great Movie,Great Classic movie but the blu-ray transfer is a little rough. Audio does not sinc well. Still a great movie.
2,"Predictable, Lame, and Extremely Dated. Merry Christmas!","I never watched this movie when I was a kid and that's probably the biggest issue I have with the film. If you're not going into this with any kind of nostalgia, honestly, the movie is just not that good. I'm worried for everyone on here who refers to this thing as ""hilarious."" If by ""hilarious"" they mean, mildly amusing at a select few points, then yes. But really, if you've never seen this movie before then save yourself the trouble and watch A Christmas Story for the billionth time instead."
1,Horrible,"I ordered this for my father for Christmas. I received an already opened blu-ray without the paper cover and a broken case. What kind of crap is that? Even if the blu-ray doesn't come with the paper cover, it should have NEVER been open nor should it have been broken."
3,"Great Movie, Awful Commentary Track","This is my favorite Christmas movie and never a year passes that I don't watch it at least once. I'm glad to have this on widescreen DVD. The commentary track is awful - especially Beverly D'Angelo who rambles on about her hair. The worst commentary track I've ever heard.Still if you don't have this on DVD, get it!"
4,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Good old movie, just right for a family with teenagers! Not as funny as Christmas with the Kranks, but almost!"
4,Very funny Christmas movie,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I can't imagine going through the struggles that Clark Griswald did just to get the perfect tree and to bring joy to his diverse family. I would recommend it to everyone.
5,Funny movie,"This is one of the funniest Christmas movies I have ever seen. Watch it 2-3 times a year, every year."
4,(Not A) Family Film,"Watching this film, myself, as an adult, I was just hysterical with laughter; I loved it!!But, watching it, as a father, well, I'll just say...it's not a family film. I felt on a whole, it's no worse than the ""Home Alone"" films, with the laugh-out-loud physical humor; on the other hand, there was brief nudity, and strong language (they say the 'F' word once, but still...), I can't comfortably allow my children to enjoy this film, and share the humorous moments (and there were many) with me.In short, I loved it. I appreciate good comedy. But, if you are searching for a wholesome, family Holiday film the whole entire family can enjoy together...well, um keep searching. As an adult, I enjoyed it; as a dad, I have to say it's not entirely approriate for younger viewers."
4,Classic,"Classic Christmas movie, this one will never fail you. Have caution when watching with or around children. There are some questionable language and sexual suggestion. Overall the disc was I good condition, no scratch's and plays like a dream."
2,christmascomedy,funny movie. not as good as elf and definitely a bit unreal for a film trying to make fun of realism.
4,Cute Gift Idea,"This would be a 5-star if the mug was full-size so one could use it. Additionally, the tin arrived dented on the side near the bottom, so impossible to pop out. I purchased for a birthday gift, and don't have time to return and wait for a replacement. The seller waited until the last possible minute to actually ship the item so it arrived on the last day of estimated delivery. Shipping was disappointing for such a small package. Amazon is usually much faster."
5,A Classic!,All all-time favorite! I like watching this one even when it's not Christmas! Everyone should have this in their holiday movie repertoire.
2,this one reloaded too many times too,"I purchased this one at the same time as Elf. If reloaded also, and I was very disappointed. Why can't it just play continuously?"
5,Classic Christmas movie,"I've watched this movie every year since I was a child, and I will continue that tradition as an adult. It is so down to earth and hilarious!"
4,Special not sure about that.,"from the title you can see i'm alittle disappointed with thisdvd, the problem is that warners did not put enough effort intothis release. so the only thing special about this dvd is the nicely done widescreen transfer of this film, what it lacked was blooper reels, deleted scenes, that's why i rated it four stars & the fact that the sound mix was alittle weak on this dvd , the vhs tape of this film was better , i do wish in the future that warners would make an excellent 5.1. sound mix to update the old pro logic mix not saying it's bad, but it does need to be a little louder . i had to turn the volume to understand what the actors were saying. but besides those things i love this film it's a classic.Highly Recommended."
5,A real classic,"One of my all-time favorite movies, I watch this all year round and it never gets old, I ALWAYS laugh!"
5,FUNNIEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER!,"This is National Lampoon's all time greatest. Chevy Chase did a fantastic job portraying who else but Clark Griswald. This time, the Griswalds are trying to make the perfect Christmas holiday, when Clark's cousin (Randy Quaide) showa up from out of town in his Winnebego with his wife, kids, and dog Snot who has a sinus infection. This is a great movie for the holidays. My favorite."
5,Best Holiday movie,"Love it. The best of the ""Vacation"" movies. I watch it every year and it hold up well. Not so sure about the Blu-ray version yet, I need to watch it a few times to see if it is really worth the extra $$$"
5,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation DVD,I purchased this for my daughter. She loves this movie and wanted the DVD. Also the price was less than our local Wal-mart.
3,There is adult content some nudity and language....,I was surprised at the content. I had seen this movie many times but there was content in this version that I had not seen. I was not impressed with the partial nudity and the language. So disappointed....
4,A CLASSIC,This is a humorous film to re-live during the Christmas season. It's a bit over the topbut still produces laughs for the whole family.
1,To much swearing for a Christmas movie.,"I have seen this movie a number of times on TV and thought it was funny. However, the DVD has to much swearing. I do not think they left any swear words out. My family and I will not watch the DVD again."
1,Terrible,"Terrible, because I never received this DVD from the Seller, and sent replys to them and they never replied. That seller was Lola Teacher. Still waiting for the 2 DVD that I ordered from them."
1,Never downloaded -- money wasted,"Nothing against the movie, but after nearly 3 days, the download had gotten no further than around 20%, even with a high-speed cable internet connection. I suppose I could have requested a refund of the $2.00 that I paid, but why bother swapping emails with some customer service person at Amazon?"
2,Disappointing Christmas Vacation...,"Movie was recommended by a ""former"" friend. Not really worth a look, especially when there are so many truly wonderful Christmas movies out there. Disappointing to say the least...sort of like Beethoven III was to the original as this movie is to the original Family Vacation. Oh, well..."
1,Rip Off,"There was no warning this that DVD would not play on a regular DVD player and now apparently I am beyond the ""return window."" If customers were not warned in advance, there shouldn't be a return window! What a rip off."
1,christmas vacation,"What is with the little woman grabbing the ""family jewels"" of Chevy Chase, at the end of the film?"
1,Terrible movie,"I understand that this movie does not assert to convey any kind of heartwarming message of Christmas. If you want that type of movie, may I heartily recommend It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or even the animated Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas. However, this movie does bill itself as being funny and funny it's not. It's a tasteless, worthless, overly contrived piece of trash. In my opinion, outlandish displays of stupidity are NEVER funny, they're just plain stupid and PATHETIC."
1,Skip this Blu-Ray,This movie is HORRIBLEY TRANSFERRED; 15% of the movie seems near HD quality. The opening cartoon is horrendously hazed with VHS quality coating. The sound is Dolby Digital 2CH not 5.1.... Honestly stick with the DVD version and put 20$ towards a True-HD movie like King Kong.... goto hddvd.org to read better reviews. I own this Blu-Ray version and rented the HD-DVD version same quality... almost unwatchable at some points.... I am a fan of this movie and sour at wasting 20$... on a final note is does look better than the standard dvd but you wont be impressed trust me... please leave comments if you OWN the movie in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray
2,Something for kids,"It just wasn't funny to me.I have no further comment about this movie,but would like to get Denzel Washington's new movie."
2,a little dull,"I watched this with my family because it had such good ratings here. I remember the ""Vacation"" movies going downhill fast after the first. I thought maybe this was an exception that I missed. But I found it slow and predictable with few good laughs. My kids thought it was OK, but I did not like it much."
2,disappointed,"In the advertisement picture on the site, it appeared that the product would also include a moose head egg nog mug. IT DIDN'T.Over all, I do not consider the price worth the product.disappointed!!!!"
5,When you need a some laughs....,"As one of the top three on our list to purchase right after we recently bought our BlueRay player, we highly recommend it for delightful comedy. Some many great characters and gags and lines with impeccable timing - doesn't get much better."
5,Nationals Lampoons Christmas Vacation,This is my favorite funny Christmas Movie. I watch it along with Miracle on 34th Street and Its a wonderful Life every year and of course we have to include the Santa Clause Movies.
5,Surprisingly Good Transition to Blu-Ray,"It's always mildly worrisome to purchase an older film in a newer, more detailed format but Christmas Vacation was restored very beautifully. We were pleasantly surprised that the textures and the sound came through with such fidelity. This is our favorite holiday film and Christmas wouldn't be possible without it. So glad that we added this classic to our blu-ray collection!"
4,HILARIOUS AND EVEN A BIT TOUCHING,"Christmas vacation ranks right up there with the all-time best Christmas movies. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo reprise their rolls as the Griswolds in this third ""vacation movie. Also back is Randy Quaid as hick cousin Eddie.Clark Griswold just wants to give his family a great old fashioned Christmas but typically goes over the top on everything. This movie demonstrates all the bad things about Christmas...dealing with family, shopping, decorating, etc...It all makes for one funny, but even a bit touching knowing how much Clark loves his family and does give them that great Christmas in the end.EVerything works here. Great character actors including E.G. marshall, and Diane ladd in roles as two of the Griswolds parents.The Special edition is nothing to write home about. All you get is an original trailer and a commentary track with Quiad, DeAngelo, and a few others, but no Chase."
4,good christmas movie,I love all the vacation movies. I collect them. This video is funny and gets you into the christmas spirit. I'd rather see a funny christmas story then a sappy sad one.
3,Why no HD audio?,"A 5 star comedy to be sure. But when a studio takes a classic and repackages it at higher cost, I except more. Better video they did, but the audio is simple 2 channel. Not even Dolby Digital 5.1."
4,"Great, but not worth Blu ray","I love the movie and it looks great, but some films just don't do Blu Ray justice. Still, love the product."
5,Bust a gut fun!,"Jeremiah Chechik brought me to this film. His direction in ""Diabolique"" intrigued me. What intrigued me more was the fact that this film, like ""Joon"", wasn't my kind of film. The direction was fabulous. The writing is insanely good. All roads in this film lead to fun. The cinematography doesn't take from the comedic skill in this film. I adore E.G. Marshall, his comedic/horror acting was/is grand in ""Creepshow"". You'll also love the teaming of Diane Ladd and Doris Roberts. Although they don't interact much, they feed off of each other to a great effect. Chevy Chase is a comedic lovers dream. Even Beverly D'Angelo is cast well here to compliment Chase. The irritating and grotesque Randy Quaid is likeable, yet leavable. This film has it all for the funny lover. This film works nevermind the time of year."
3,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Blu-ray),The movie had too many curse words it had a PG 13 rating but it should have been rated R
1,Worst of Chevy's movies,"Chevy Chase must've been EXTREMELY A desperate for money if he stooped this low to make a piece of unfunny trash like this.Watch as Chevy throws away his wonderful acting talent in this holiday turkey.Groan in agony as the unfunny relative makes that sick joke about the family cat being fried-a joke that's so sick that it would even make a cat-hater shake with pure anger. Avoid this trashy movie,and if you were unfortunate to have this movie,then burn it.If you want a funny movie,go with ""Liar,Liar"" or Jeff Foxworthy videos instead."
2,"A great movie, but what an awful DVD.....shameful","I would be ashame if I was Warner Bros. for releasing this DVD. Warner Bros has managed to put one of the best movies of all time on to one of the worst DVD's of all time. What a joke. Full-screen, no features.? Come on. And of course they release another DVD of Christmas Vacation 9 months later with some features. So now consumers have to buy the other if they want widescreen and features. What a joke. Give us a little better WB."
1,HD DVDs,"This DVD was marked HD. Since we have new tv's that are HD, I thought it would be good to get it in HD. Found out that HD DVD's will only play on ""HD"" video players. HD and Blueray were in competition several years ago and Blue ray won out (like Beta & VHS many years ago--VHS won). You can only play an ""HD"" dvd on an HD player and I'm sure there are not many of those around. The HD dvd would not play at all. The only regular DVD the company offered was a higher price than other sellers, and they would not give me a refund, so I'm just out the money I spent."
1,Bad Crop of DVD's for this movie,"Every year our family watches an old VCR tape of this movie for Christmas. So decided that this year I'd update it with a new DVD. Unfortunately, the sound was out of sinc with the movement of the lips. Kind of like one of the old Saturday Night Live skits they did about the old Roman warrior movies. Amazon made good and sent a new one. Unfortunately, this new one did the same thing. When I talked to a representative from Amazon they said they would pull the stock from the shelves and review the other ones to see whether they had gotten a bad batch. Their advice was to wait a couple of weeks before trying again. I'm thinking I'll get it somewhere else."
1,Mouth and dialogue aren't together,"I LOVE this movie! It's my favorite Christmas movie!We got a Blu-ray for Christmas, and I wanted ""Christmas Vacation"" to be one of the first Blu-ray movies I got for our collection.I ordered it through Amazon, got it quickly, and, alas, the words and the actors' mouths are not in sync.This bothered me greatly, so, I returned it to Amazon, and they sent me another movie.And, this one is doing the same thing.So, I'm assuming all are like this.Otherwise, the movie is so funny and a great Christmas adventure because we all can see ourselves in the situations presented in the movie."
1,This Version is GARBAGE!,"I just got my copy of the SE version of Christmas Vacation.I've been waiting and watching for it to come out in widescreenformat for years. Finally it arrives! But wait, what's this??It's a ""Matted Widescreen"". What's a ""Matted"" Widescreen?Why that's the pan-and-scan version with the top and bottomscut off. So instead of losing 30% of the movie's scenes watchingthe pan-and-scan version, you can now lose more than 50% ofthe movie!! To top it off, I also purchased ""A Christmas Story -20th Anniversary"" edition to find out Warner Brothers did thesame thing to it. I'm sending both back!! Shame on you WarnerBrothers!"
5,Hilarious,Love this Christmas comedy. Sure to make you laugh. Bought this for both of my girls to start their own family memories.
3,Different From Original?,"I love this movie and was excited to buy the new Special Edition DVD. I have been watching it on an original VHS release until then. It seems to me that to create the widescreen they may have cut some of the movie off the top and bottom. If you have both, compare for yourself. One of the scenes that clued me in on it was when they were eating the overcooked turkey. In the original you can see Clark poring a large amount of gravy on his plate. In the DVD you can't see it.Another thing I noticed is that during on part of Clark's speedy sled scene in the original, you could clearly see the rope pulling him. In this DVD it may have been digitally erased, since I couldn't find it.I'm sure there are other things different. I love the movie, but almost just want to stick with my original VHS release."
3,"Great Movie, But Poor DVD","Of course this is one of the best Christmas films of all time. It is a family classic whenever relatives come into town. This is the reason I bought it on DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD is not worth the buy. There are only a couple extras and the sound and quality seem as though they weren't even the least bit tweaked. Hence, if you own a great home entertainment system, prepare to be disappointed. When I played this movie on my DTS system, I only got left and right fronts to give any output.Sorry to come down so hard on such a wonderful movie, but the difference between VHS and DVD on this film is very minimal."
1,One of the GREAT Blu-Ray Ripoffs,I should have heeded the reviews of this disc. It exhibits poor image quality and the 2 channel audio is an insult. Buy the DVD!!
5,Love it!!!!!,"My wife and I just received this in the mail on Friday. I have read a lot of reviews about the quality and sound of the movie and my two cents worth is, yes you really cant tell a big difference in the quality but there is a difference. There is a little more depth in the blu-ray than on the regular dvd. I loved all the little trinkets that came with the blu-ray!!!!!! Some people complained that they were crappy and cheap, well what do you expect for something that costs less than $40. If you wanted high dollar memorabilia then maybe you should try an auction instead of a mass produced blu-ray tin!! All in all I love the blu-ray and the trinkets that came with it."
3,Terrible DVD,"I think this movie is very funny and stands out as one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time. I am however very disappointed in the dvd version of this movie. Fortunately,I only paid seven dollars for the movie or I would be very upset. The movie seems as if they took a regular vhs copy of the flick and scanned it and burned some copies. I only had to watch about five minutes of the movie to see that Warner Brothers did nohing to restore this movie to a near perfect condition which dvd users are used to. Im very disappointd and expected so much more from this movie."
4,"The Griswolds again, at least they stayed home!","Delightful holiday epic centering around the good-natured Clark Griswold, and his family. Beverly D'Angelo looked especially good in this. I have since had dreams of her in a Santa cap (and nothing else). Rusty and Audrey were kinda lame in the movie. Randy Quaid was a jerk, but that is his appeal. I would give this 1/2 thumbs up (due to amputation)."
2,Mehhh...,"I bought this as a gift to someone who apparently loves Chevy Chase and his movies of this genre, but it's been 3 months since I got it for them and it's still in the wrapper. Bahh, it's the last time I go against my own taste and throw my money away."
5,lol,"National Lampoon's never fails to amuse us. While dealing with the stress of the holiday season, it's nice to watch a movie that proves your not alone. Non-stop laughter."
5,Christmas Tradition,I watch this movie every year. The DVD was in conditioned advertised and arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend Amazon to anyone.
5,great movie,great christmas movie or for that matter a great all around make you laugh movie when your down in the dumps chevy chase is crazy.
5,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"After viewing this movie on television during the Holiday season, just had to haveit in our collection. It's good clean fun and brings a load of laughs throughoutthe entire movie, with a happy ending. What more could one want."
5,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,I have however not watched it yet. But it looks great and arrived in a timely manner. It is a Christmas present for my daughter. It is my favorite Christmas movie. Beverly
5,Hilarious,Great movie. A Christmas classic. Everyone in the family will enjoy it. We have made it a family tradition to watch it every year at the beginning of the Christmas season to kick off the holiday!
5,fun for all,everyone who has ever had there family crowed in for christmas or was look to for making christmas merry will love this its funny warm and a must see for the holidays
1,"Great movie, but the DVD arrived cracked","Either bad packaging or rough handling, but this arrived cracked, so it was a return.This is the BEST Christmas movie though."
5,Best christmas movie ever,"is it really worth the time to review this movie. its a classic and if you have not seen it, go ahead and order two copies, one for you and one for your mother."
1,the rookies,"fellow rookies fan, do not feel too bad, i been waiting for season 3 of ''The Mod Squad'', which is like the very same serie, but only better, and was orginaly on abc as well. but cbs/and paramount won't release season 3 of this serie either, i even contacted the company, both cbs/paramount which told me this thank you bob--the t.v. ---man"
5,scoop on Duke,Recently had a 80th Birthday party for a family member. Showed pictures of his life story with Duke playing in background. Guests his same age as well as the birthday boy throughly enjoyed the moment.
4,silk road,I ordered this video for a world history class and I felt it did not do what I had expected. Although the images are vivid and beautifully photographed it was not the video I needed to introduce the Silk Road to my class. It would be good to add dimension after the fact.
1,Chinese propaganda,"I was dismayed to pay more than $20 for this DVD, thinking it would be an illuminating video about the Silk Road to show kids. Slow, deadly opening on tea cultivation in China and then some bits straight out of Chinese propaganda about the evils of life in Tibet before the Peoples Republic of China came to power. Wonder who really financed this documentary?"
1,Secrets of the silk road,I was VERY disappointed. Marco Polo's Roof of the World is exactly the same DVD as this one. How can they sell the same film with two different titles and two different cover illustrations. There's no way to tell that you are buying the same film twice!!!!
4,BELIEVING IS HEARING!,"Some of the best multi-cultural sounds predating the world music of today without sounding prehistoric. Narada Michael Walden's contribution (Surrender Rose) is one of his all time finest compositions.(Then he went off dancing in the disco, who can figure? But that is another story all together.) I'm keeping an ""eagle eye"" pealed for a copy of this one...my record is long over-played! Check out Don Cherry's work with CODONA. Super stuff, as well! High Praises!"
1,A few seconds,"This CD is almost totally a waste of Cherry's time and energy. Those of us who bought it as Cherry fans when it first came out called it ""Disco Don"" and gave it away or sold it (cheap). This is standard funk jazz, faceless and hysterically excited about nothing. The biggest shame here is that an otherwise unrecorded Cherry composition, which begins wistfully with Collin Walcott's sitar, a piece that in concert was brilliantly played by Cherry on piano and trumpet, is hereby immortalized as yet another piece of fusion tripe. A reviewer a little ways up the ladder here says Relativity Suite should be reissued, and when that happy day comes may Disco Don also vanish without a trace---except for those few seconds...."
5,Ben & Danielle,"Jon Land's Ben & Danielle series is one of the best I have read in a long time: wonderfully conceived, beautifully executed, and perfectly researched. I found myself looking at maps and photos of the Mid-East to supplement my reading (something I've never done before!). His understanding of the politics of policing as well as the politics of the Israel-Palestine dynamic is amazing.Thank you Jon for introducing me to a world I would never have otherwise known.Readers, load these books on your Kindle AND buy the printed ones - they are keepers!!"
4,Jon Land is King,"I've been reading Jon Land novels for a while now and have loved most of them. I'll admit, that my favorite character is Blaine McCracken and that I'd like to see more books with him, but Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea are great characters as well. I started this book a couple of days ago and I couldn't put it down. He's gotten much better with these characters as the books go by. The plot was good and it kept your interest all the way through. The only draw back that I saw to this book was that he copied a part from one of his earlier books almost verbatim. I was a little put out by that. All in all, though, well worth the read."
1,Painful to read,"I don't expect great literature when I read a detective story, but it would be nice if the plot was at least remotely believable and the author had some facility with the English language. Unfortunately, neither is true here. I actually winced when reading portions of this book and finally found it too painful to continue. I am impressed with one thing: that an author of such mediocrity could get his work published."
4,Complete Desktop PC Tool Set,A great tool set for working on desk top PC's. Nice quality! I liked it so much a bought a second set for my IT guy at work. He is impressed.
3,Always sounds smooth,"Continuiung the smooth sound of one of the masters, this is a good one to add to your collection. Even when performing ""cover"" songs, Lou's distinctive voice makes it sound oh sooo goood."
2,Lou Rawls: Live at the Dentist,"If you're thinking about buying this CD because you love Rawls' amazing blues and jazz vocals, don't! BuyThe Legendary Lou Rawls,Live!, or one of his many other fine releases instead. This CD is full of sappy pop songs, most of which belong in your dentist's office rather than your CD player."
4,Very Good Album,A well written album both musically and lyrically. The vocals are awesome as always.
3,Modification Needed,I have arthritis and have trouble unlocking my front door. When this arrived I placed it on my key but found that it would not allow my key to fully enter the lock. So I had to take the scissors to it to get it to work. Now the key is kind of loose itside it and shifts around but I can open my door.
3,One amazing saxaphone solo,"I bought this DVD for one sax solo, after having rented it on Netflix 2 or 3 times.That solo is in the first song, 'The world is a ghetto', and is one of the best sax solos I remember in a song,just great.So, my recommendation for this would be for that solo.The rest of the CD is one of the original WAR members with other musicians; there's controversy because the other WAR members were not allowed to use the name in a dispute with the manager who had the rights.For me the rest of the concert is 'good' but not especially remarkable. A nice 'once in a while' watch."
3,War is Hell,"I was very excited to finally get this DVD after several attempts to purchase it with no luck, from other websites. It is a Blu-ray but the colors are so washed out that it does not really matter how it was recorded. The surround sound is OK at best. The performance of the band could have been great, but it is not. The lead singer/ keyboard player talks way too much and sings way too little. Save your money and see it you can find it on Youtube, instead."
1,"Good Tribute Band, but not the real thing...","If they were to call this a live performance by, say, the ""War Experience"" or ""Lonnie Jordan & Company"", it would be all-good. However, it's being called ""War"", and a lot of people who don't know any better have gone out and paid for this trash. Meanwhile, the other four surviving members of the REAL War and forced to use the moniker of the ""Lowrider Band.""Simply put, if you're a REAL War fan, you'll ignore this DVD. Buy the classic Live album instead or even the low-quality live DVD from 1980."
5,More readable than the original,"I have read the original and unabridged copy, and I find this new one much easier to read. Excellent book--reads like a textbook. Answers every question a person could have about healing, and it made a believer out of me. The book uses scripture and logic to explain the theology of healing according to the Holy Bible. They just don't write books like this anymore."
4,Good book!,I bought this book for my mother. She said it is really good. I do intend to buy it because I've heard a lot about it.
5,Best Book Ever,Best book I have ever read on any subject that pertains to christianity. Bosworth believed in healing...and was used by God to heal many. He was both theoretically on top of his game and in the bible...but he also was used practically by God as a healer. This book is also great to give to skeptics of healing.
5,Christ the Healer by F. F. Bosworth: worth a good read.,"Not one of the newest authors, Bosworth was a campaigner for Christ in the late 1800s. However the gospel is always relevant and Bosworth was one of the men that brought the Christ purchased covenant of salvation and healing to light. Christ the Healer is a very comprehensive collection of sermons proving through scriptural reference, healing of the body is just as much a part of the atonement as is salvation. Is healing relevant today? You will be able not only to say YES, but to have a clear and relevant understanding of why it is YES. This is certainly one of the best books on the subject of healing I have ever read."
3,Planner knives,The planner knives did not come in the factory packaging as shown. They were in a plastic bag with a part nuber tag attached with wire around the edges of the planner knives. Not the best way to treat the cutting edges.
4,"""Bill Smith"" Can't Read","Regarding Bill Smith's review, this is the only studio version available of ""You Are My Sister"". The liner notes clearly state the person singing with Antony - BOY GEORGE. His voice and vibrato are shot due to hard core drug addiction and two decades of hard living. It's a great song, nonetheless!!!"
2,Not What I Wanted,"The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either. The primary reason for buying this CD was the song ""You Are My Sister"", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing."
5,Intelligence and Elegance team to crescendo the series,"I'm really looking forward to number 4 in the series, as the first three build an intriguing Morgan. It is insufficient to characterize these books as mysteries or suspense or thrillers. Whatever you think you know on one page, whether about the characters or plot or even the landscape, changes on the next. Start with any book in this series and you'll be drawn to the other two. And number 4 is just begging for a box set and a series with Angelina Jolie as Morgan!"
1,someone put their vacation shots on disk,"the only interesting pictures were the first few then they were repetitive, just shooting from different angles. The music was cheesy. Not worth the $ you spend on it."
3,Short but good for beginners,Good book for the basics and getting to know the first basic chords. Confusing as to why the right hand seems to form more chords than the left hand. Always thought the left hand did most of the chords in piano.
2,Pass This By Save Your Money,"The book is to confusing and hard to figure out. It is not for the person that does not know anything about piano or how to read music. The CD should have ""intro's"" to each lesson and it does not making it hard to figure out after listening to the ""follow"" part. I would like to know how to return this. This by far is the worse product I have purchased from Amazon. I was so unhappy I went & took ""real"" piano lessons. I showed the book to the instructor she admitted it was to confusing...Forget this purchase save your money...Wish I had."
2,Its Been Done...,"If you've read ""In the Grove of the Druids"" by Philip Carr-Gomm and Ronald Hutton, then you probably know of the established links between Ross Nichols and Gerald Gardner, the fathers of modern Druidry and Witchcraft respectively. In that book, two very respected authors reveal to the world that the modern incarnation of Wicca is, in fact, a combination of the two separate religious and magical styles: Druidry and Witchcraft. So, if Druidry and Witchcraft have already been combined to form modern Wicca, why combine the systems again? If you wish to combine the systems of Druidry and Witchcraft without reading through tome after tome of Celtic Wiccan fluff, read about the two separate systems and combine them yourself. This book is just a watered-down time-saver."
5,"Tasty, proven recipes!","A la Carte has become something of a sensation in the small college town of Cleveland, Miss. This book shares many of the shop's best recipes.It's the book I like to turn to when I'm planning a party - the hors d'oeuvres recipes are wonderful! The Southwestern Torta in particular is a favorite - I've never had anyone who didn't love it.The soup and salad recipes are also yummy, too. I highly recommend the book!"
3,Better than nothing but not full protection.,"It fits to most mountain bikes, but not stable. The protection from front fender is okay, but the rear fender is not long and wide enough to protect from water splashing from rear tire."
5,Great characters - excellent research,"""The only way to tell the story of any battle is to tell it equally from both sides, which Todd Jones has done. The book handled the love story beautifully. The characters were given a lot of depth, you could feel yourself in their place at that time. The amount of research done for this book is obvious."
4,compliments to boyzone on there efforts,"actually i like boyzone the most. i ve already listened ""where we belong"".i m not gonig to buy it now, i want to congradulate them on there effort.they should accept it from a heart of a proud ""PAKISTANI"".i love them. please give me info about there other albums (other then ""where we belong"") at my e-mail address given: schozab@yahoo.co.uk"
2,Great for Seminary Students,"This book is great for seminary student, but I would not recommend it for practical ministry."
3,Good Selection of songs,"Must tracks have been re mastered to current standards, its a pity some of the older tracks were not treated in the same manner"
5,"Have no fear, Yolonda's here",The author of Yolonda's genius is Carol Fenner. This story is about a young girl that tries to show the world that her little brother is a musical genius. I liked this book because it shows how a sister can find enough love to protect her little brother from all the bad people in the world. She also showed courage and determination. I think that this book relates to real life and I would recomend it to all children.
3,Yolanda's So So,"Our book group at our middle school just read this book. Just like the other reviewers, some of us liked it and some of us didn't.Here are the good comments. Yolanda was a very intelligent girl. She thought of many ways to come up with a plan for Andrew. These plans made it fun to read. The book was realistic since Yolanda usually followed the rules but like real teenagers, she broke the rules when she thought it was justified. This realism was a positive point. Yolanda really cared about her brother. This also was admirable.Here are some bad points. The ending was too sudden, leaving the reader feeling desserted. The meaning behind the title was never made clear.Overall, most of the students aren't really glad they read this book."
5,Yolanda's Genius,This was a great book! I really liked it because it showed that anyone can be a hero. I hope they have a sequel because the author never really ended the book.
1,not age appropriate,"I don't think the language that is used (starting on page 16 and 17 with the word ""effing"") is appropriate for my 10 year old who had to read it as part of his required summer reading. Other words in the book are ""freakin"" ""bitchin"" and ""kick your ass"". The word ""effing"" or rather f------ing really upset me. My son didn't appreciate it either. Are there any good books out there without this language? When I was in 5th grade I sure didn't read words like this."
3,"Suitable only for young adults, not for elementary age child","The plot of the book is good, but only for young adults, NOT elementary age childen. There are quite a few references to sex, violence, school shootings. The character, Yolanda, solves her problems with fighting, and even says of the kids at school, ""I should have killed them"". NOT a message we need out there these days. Please make sure your young child does not read."
2,Yolonda's Barfus,This book was not so good. It was too corny. I hate open endings. Don't read this book unless you want to cry a ton. Aunt Tiny is funny.
2,Boring Book,"This book was kind of boring. I didn't want to keep reading it, but I had to. It was for a book club for AAUW. That's why I had to keep reading it. I sort of hated it in a way. Nothing really happens, but I think older people will like it better than a twelve-year-old girl from rural Ohio. Thanx."
2,didn't like it,This book was the most boringest book i ever read.it took me amonth to read it and usually it doesn't take me that long to read a book. if you like this book you are a boring person and have no life whatsoever.
4,Yolanda's Genius,"What is genius anyway? After being called a genius herself, Yolanda decides to look up the true definition in the dictionary. Upon reading it, she realizes that it does not describe her, but rather her younger brother Andrew. Yolanda is determined to convince the world of his special gifts, even if he is only a meek and mild first grader with a talent for music. This book paints a vivid visual picture with its descriptive vocabulary. Carol Fenner has a way of appealing to your senses. It pulls you in to the experiences of this young girl and her determination. This book is extremely moving. I truly liked ""Yolanda's Genius,"" by Carol Fenner. I feel that any young reader with an imagination will enjoy it."
4,A Great Comp Of Dr. Hook Songs Capitol.,"Well in beginning i bought this album for the songs: Cover Of The Rolling Stone & When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman. But as soon i popped in this disc i just fell in love with whole thing. the and more to title of the album impiles the fact that there are few songs tacked on for your listening pleasure, i must say my favorite tracks are: I Could'nt Believe, A Little Bit More. Sexy Eyes & Sharing The Night Together( Are Definitely Disco Influnced) but still likeable. Radio should've may the top ten along with Cover Of The Rolling Stone, Years From Now. Brings tears almost, it's tender ballad. This album is one that you'll want to dance to because there are slow and fast tunes. when i listening to this album i think of palm trees and the sun."
4,Versatile band; Something for everyone,"I'd forgotten all about Dr. Hook, to tell the truth, until looking around for something by another 70's band. Then I saw this and started reading the track titles, and so many memories just started coming back. The band shows something for everyone. For the raunchier side, with somewhat sarcastic songs like ""Cover of Rolling Stone,"" what-was-I-thinking songs like ""Only Sixteen,"" lush love songs like ""A Little Bit More,"" and my favorite,the funky disco feeling tracks like ""Sexy Eyes,"" and ""When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman."" And the best part is, these songs all seem true-to-heart. You feel like you could actually get somewhere with a girl by singing ""Sharing The Night Together.' A very pleasant musical treat. Spend 40 minutes going back to the 70s with this CD. You won't regret it, and may also wind up hoping your picture's on the cover of Rolling Stone."
2,Latter Day Hook,"I suppose if you love Dr. Hook's latter-era disco sell-out, you might like this. The first two songs, from the brilliant Bankrupt album (unavailable on CD in the US) are almost worth the money. The rest is disco love ballads. And the mastering is absolutely horrid. You'll find better compilations elsewhere."
2,refund issue,"Unfortunately the item I purchased was damaged. So it turns out I recieved a envelope with just a personal check and post-it explaining this to me. I did pay amazon with a pre-paid credit card, and since I do not have a bank account, the personal check is worthless to me. I have yet to find the time to contact this retailer in texas, but I would hesitate regardless since its a personal check with a home phone #"
3,not the greatest,"I know it's a personal choice, but the good Dr. has a lot better songs in his pocket. The cd itself was in good shape and trhe vendor performed well"
4,Takes you back in time.,"All the songs that we grew up on....nice to take a trip back to that simpler time. It's nice to escape back and leave the job, mortgage, life as we know it today at least in our minds when all we worried about was what time we were going to the lake and what movie was playing at the drive-in."
5,Excellent Product,Works very well at keeping the Koi fed at my home that I am renting. I do not have to rely on the tenants to keep the fish fed.
3,nice but too expensive,"My now 8 year old son has loved elephants all his life. He has a huge collection of art items and toy items. So, this one since it is a big elephant (and a baby which he did not want but you cannot buy the big one separately anywhere) was missing. It is quite sturdy and the fact that there are joint just above the elephant's ankles is a nice thing. It does mimic that way the animals feet bent so impressively and gingerly considering its size. So, one could say it does even teach the child to pay intention to that. However, if your kid is very young and loves to move those joints all the time, you can trust that they will be lose in now time--just as all the other movable parts on a playmobil."
2,One could live without ever seen it,"In my humble view, this is a side and insignificant story---A woman who claimed to be Mussolini's wife and mother of his first son, claims which she was unable to proof. The question is, in what way is this story important? Why would people need to learn about this lady's case? It is impossible not to feel sorry for her ordeals and her son's tragic end but it tells little about Italy or even Mussolini. If the idea was to illustrate the degree of repression during the fascist regime, the movie failed to do so. Some degree of repression is the background to the story of this lady whose emotional stability is questionable at all times.Mussolini was a second rate dictator who got his country into a war it was unprepared for. Italy's modest infrastructure was destroyed and the noble values of its young generations was abused and their dreams frustrated. This is the only story when it comes to fascism in Italy.I bought it, do not make the same mistake."
4,Love for people and hate for someone who loved him!,"Visceral portrait of a wealthy woman (Ida Dasler), dazzled by the sparkling charisma of this men's whisperer who committed the big mistake to fall in love with a man destined to be one of the most cruel tyrants of the Century: Benito Mussolini, hailed for many and hated for others, this curious dictator handled the will of this woman becoming her his lover, leaving her pregnant and ignoring her at all when the power came to him.Private vices, public virtue seems to fit once more for this emblematic case, in which this unhappy woman and her child are sent to discrete places with the visible complicity of venerable holy actors.Bellochio made a sublime masterwork remarking and underlyning the nastiness, proper of the double moral of this ruthless dictator.Brilliant edition, sumptuous photography, incisve direction and the amazing performance of Giovanna Mezogiorno make of this film a true filmic gem.Don't miss it."
2,"An interesting bit of (possible) history, but a tedious movie.","Some good, compelling scenes. Uniformly fine performances. An interesting bit of (possible) history. Unfortunately those good, compelling scenes are few and far between and overwhelmed by an otherwise tedious movie."
4,"My oh, oh my!","If the Tsar were living today, the author would be exiled at best to the fartherst reaches of Siberia.The book is poorly marketed in that it is about 20% fiction, which the author acknowledges in the preface, though without that percentage. Proper marketing of the book as other than pure history may have increased sales.The fun of this book is that it takes an already interesting life story and adds lots of unfounded ""color."" This may fuel the reader's interest in other, real histories.The downside here is that I believe this to be the book that is the source is the book of ""rumours"" of Alexander having an incestuous relationship with his sister, among other sorts of such activities. Of course there is no bibliography.It takes some work, by the way, to find credible histories of Alexaner I.The serious downside is I am not sure I would waste my time on other books by this author, since I try to focus on regular histories. Maybe his others usually only masquerade as history as well."
2,deluxe spirograph,"It kept jumpiing around the table and had to be taped down. I expected the ""deluxe"" would have colored pens or pencils but it only had 1 dark pen. My grandson did not enjoy it at all. Very dissapointed."
1,Simply Not Functional,Poor Design for a young child (or even an adult).Both in terms of functionality as well as presentation value of the masterpieces.
1,Not like it used to be,This was one of my favorite toys when I was a child (back in the 70's) and I was excited to purchase it for my daughter. It isn't as well made as or easy to use as it used to be back in the day!
1,Earlier model was better!,"My sister had this when we were little and remembering the fun she and I both had with it, I bought it for my son. I am very disappointed with it!! The template does not fit flush with the table surface and therefore does not securely hold the paper. In addition, the gears are too thin and keep slipping under the template, ruining the design. My son found this very frustrating as it ruined picture after picture and it is very difficult to move the gears and hold the template down at the same time. I gave the durability factor a poor rating as the material is just cheap plastic that will definitely not last long. This is definitely a case of where the old adage that says, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" should have been followed!! The earlier design, though not perfect, was much better and much less frustrating! Save your money and buy something else!"
1,"OK, but with a really dumb design flaw","This would be a nice toy if not for one serious design flaw.The flaw is that the gears supplied are too thin and easilyslide under the main unit ruining a drawing. This happens ifyou don't push down hard on the main unit or use a perfectlyflat, hard surface. The solution wouldbe simple for Hasbro to fix this. Simply make the gears thatmesh at the teeth the same thickness. This would require a flatside and a side with a depression. This would still allow forthe pen to have a thin section to poke through. Alternately,a tapered opening could be used for the pen tip and the geardisk all the same thickness. But a gear that has the samethickness as the main unit would prevent the gears from slippingunder the unit. This is a no brainer fix, but it's doubtfulthat Hasbro will fix it. So don't buy any more until they do."
1,Its a shame....,"...this is nothing like the Spirograph I grew up playing with. As everyone else mentioned, the gears are much too thin and slip constantly. My 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws. Don't waste your money!!"
1,HUGE Disappointment,"What a HUGE disppointment this item is! Absoultly NOTHING like the original classic I had as a child some 25 years ago. Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves for turning out this junky, cut-rate, knockoff. I am sorry I did not read any reviews before my mother spent $10 on this for her grandsons. My 4-year old nephew first went to use it on Christmas Day and the ball in the pen was faulty so the pen did not work. The meger handful of only round gears are too thin and cheaply made to track correctly. The paper slides all around under the frame. I have nothing good to say about this product."
2,Not like the Spirograph I grew up with,"The idea is the same which is great; however, you have to literally hold the template down while your child is making the design. Otherwise, the gear keeps sliding under the template. My 6-year-old (who just got this) was getting extremely frustrated & was almost in tears saying she's not a baby while I held down the template. We finally just put it away for a bit & she's not showing any interest in trying again."
2,what happened to spirograph,"This product is good, well built but new fangled. Whatever happened to the good old multi gear spirograph. The additional bells, whistles and templates take away from what I remember as the magic of spirograph...does anyone sell the good old spirograph?"
3,A good set for Spirograph fans,"Even though this is discontinued, Spirograph rocks if you are patient. This set has a good variety of wheels to use."
4,deluxe spirograph,not as i remembered as a child - but then many things change over the years. would have been nice if pens or colored pencils were included
3,"Still fun, needs to be more solid","It reminds me of my childhood and I wanted my daughter to enjoy it too. It is still fun, but you spend more time holding it down so It wont move, it simply does not seem as sturdy, but still a fun day drawing."
2,not a great entertainer,The product consists of simple plastic light weight parts that do not lend themeselves to use by children.for whom the item is designed. The item is overpriced by the manufacturer.
1,Old Version was MUCH Better!,...I remember as a child playing for HOURS with my spirograh making beautiful designs! This model is in no comparison. The wheels will NOT stay in the grooves there-fore causing the paper to slip. It would be a CUTE toy if it worked right. This model needs to go back and be re-designed...
1,SAVE YOUR $$$ and the ENIRONMENT since this toy is only good for the trash,"This toy is terrible. Read all the reviews. It is cheap and doesn't work. So sad, I had so much fun doing this as a child."
2,Not like the one you remember as a kid,I know the tiny pins that held down the circles on the original product may be considered dangerous today but the new one simply does not work well. The shapes are awkward and not as cool as I remember. Skip this toy.
2,Takes too many hands to use,"Santa brought this present for our daughter, she loves to doodle and make projects. The top piece has too much of a gap and it doesn't stay tight enough to hold the ""wheel"" on the paper.Very frustrating for kids."
1,Big Flop,"I was very excited to buy this for my daughter, remembering the fun I had with this toy as a child. the gear and drawing template are made with flimsy plastic that is bowed and doesn't fit correctly in place, which causes the gears not to work.even without the gear template, the tray notches don't fit correctly with the gear notches. VERY Disappointed! I am going to take it back!"
1,Not Well Made,"My daughter got this toy as a Christmas present and she did not even get to play with it. The plastic bowes so much that the center ring slides under the toy, making it impossible to play with. Not well made at all. I'm sure this could be fun, if the center piece snapped in, to keep it secure. Needs a good redesign."
1,"It doesn't work, don't buy this one",I had one as a kid in the eighties and I just loved it. So when my daughter received this as a gift I was just over the moon.And then we tried it out and...it doesn't work.The pink gear template does not snap into place allowing the small orange gears to slide around and it doesn't create the pretty spiral it is supposed to. Why is it they had a great one in 1984 but 27 years later...they sell a non-working version for quadruple the price?
2,Not the same,"This is just not the same. I bought this for my son. Now I am on the search for a different one. I don't like the fact that it slips. It always slips. A lot of paper got wasted, and my son got angry. I tried and I got angry."
4,"Impressive, but not faultless...","OK, look, this is a very impressive volume. Clearly written and quite a nice over-view.But I have to say the sections on Jewish resistance during the Holocaust were pathetic. The author briefly mentions The Warsaw ghetto uprising, and a few words about Hannah Senesh, but that's about it. He doesn't even mention the uprisinsg at Treblinka and Sobibor, the fighters of Vilna or Lodz, or the amazing and daring feats of a Jewish patisans in the woods throughout Europe. He also fails to mention that the strongest and best fighters tended to be Bundists, not Zionists.Oh well, hard to write such a sweeping history and cover everything. But to say the Jews went to their deaths like ""sheep"" (p.541) and not even adequately recount their heroism and resistance is irresponsible and greatly disappointing."
5,What a tale!,"I read the ""sequel"" first, so this book was even more interesting...I won't spoil it by telling you why! The author shares the story of a major shift in her life in a way that reads like fiction. The characters, the backdrop of a beautiful farm, the barely believable experiences all come together to spin a yarn of exceptional quality. It made me yearn to follow the same path - bumps, ruts, floods and all. Escapism at its very best - her attitude is honest, her writing exceptionaland the story itself makes you feel as though you have gained an invaluable friend. Be sure to read her next book - how wonderful to know you can continue along on her journey!"
3,"Blog Posts, not a Cohesive Narrative","SPOILERSAlthough this hit me where I (want to) live in terms of wish fulfillment, the story was a bit too stream-of-consciousness and fragmented for me to really buy into it. It works much better if you picture it as a series of blog posts or columns, which was the original publishing medium. I also found it hard to reconcile her excessive grief over her cat's death vs. her seeming trivialization of her husband's cancer scare. I give it a B- overall."
4,Seductive Country Dream Come True,"I ran across this book in the bookstore where I work and picked it up out of curiosity. I was raised in a small town, and living in Chicago, I miss greatly my garden and the moist smell of the earth in Spring.I found myself skimming much of the first chapter, as I felt it was too affectatious, but after a while, when the story shifts to the historical present, I became truly engrossed.I found myself laughing at Jeanne and Alex's naivete (wearing Eddie Bauer to a truck stop!) but also identifying with their dreams and desiring them for myself.After they land in their dream home, reality runs smack dab into their foreheads as though they drove into a brick wall. But they learn to dig into their inner resources and survive.I highly recommend this book, and I was deeply moved by Jeanne Marie's story and those of the characters surrounding her. I would be interested in reading an update of their story."
5,Fifty Acres of FUN!,"This book was so much fun that I just ordered her follow up book! The Author is very warm and funny. Her thoughts and descriptions are very homey and comfortable. I cried my eyes out about ""Bob"", but I'm a total softy! I highly recommend this book if you want a warm and cozy book to read!"
3,Wish it had been more about the farm,"I picked up this book about the same time my boyfriend and I began discussing having a farm of our own one day. Being city folk myself, I figured this story would be right up my alley. It is a very entertaining and well written book and the stories of her run ins with her hunter neighbors are truly funny. I just found myself bored with her constant self-reflection. There were too many breaks in the rhythm of the story where I found myself either skipping ahead or putting the book down. I understand she was ""finding herself"" on the farm, but I was more interested in hearing about the farm itself."
4,From Urban Jungle to Rural Jungle,"A charming tale of urban escape to rural life. The book is filled with characters guaranteed to make the reader want to pull up stakes for the rustic life. My favorite part was the author's better half, a man's man, the proud owner of the title's poodle, who's first country purchase is a monster tractor of awesome power and noisemaking capability. I can relate to him, not the poodle, just the tractor."
4,A book for those whom love animals and wide open spaces!,"After reading these reviews I just had to buy this book and I'm glad I did... ...This is a memoir-style story about how two animal loving people, a mutt and cat loving writer (Jeanne Marie Laskas) and a poodle packing physchologist, (her long time male friend) that begin as friends in the city and end up sharing their lives with each other and the pets they cherish on a 50 acre farm. This is both funny and entertaining, mixed with the realities of life when it comes to losing beloved pets and family. For anyone that thinks animals are people too, you will enjoy this fast-paced and humorous adventure!"
2,"Great writing, mediocre story","I enjoyed reading this book, but didn't find the story that compelling. The book is beautifully written and has wonderful lines that you will want to read out-loud."
1,How could anyone be that clueless?,"The unbelievably clueless move to the country where they continually display an uncommon lack of common sense and the apparent inability to plan ahead. It was funny at first, but I wasn't laughing with the author, I was laughing at her. By the time they moved to the country I was hoping some hunter would accidentally shoot her and put me out of my misery. I literally threw the tape out of my car window."
4,A Childhood Favorite,"This was a favorite book of mine when I was back in the low single-digit age range. It tells the story of a bunch of bored kids who paint a jungle on their bedroom wall and then enter the picture. They manage to paint their way out of a number of scrapes, including painting a tiger chekerboard, which then causes the tiger to retreat from embarasment.I see that the copyright was renewed in 1989 -- hopefully it will someday be available in print again."
4,Beautiful,"The video quality is excellent. The scenes are beautiful and makes me wish more movies would return to this style of videography. The sound is another issue.....loud soft loud soft, I constantly had to adjust the volume to hear it or keep from being blown out of my chair by it."
5,At last the entire Bond set in Blu-ray,"The entire Bond film collection (the official one, not counting Never Say Never Again and the Sellers/Allen Casino Royale) is finally available in Blu-ray. The set even has a place for Skyfall when it's released in February."
4,Great Buy for the Bond Buff,Great set... it will make you laugh at what we thought were the best car chases and gizmos of that time. Great entertainment! The later Bond movies are still worth the time to enjoy! The first 4 movies reminds you of Sean Connery's best role!
3,No french subtitles on most of movies - Pas de sous-titres franais sur la plupart des films,"I bought this item based on the fact that Amazon indicates there is french subtitles on the movies. Unfortunately, most of the movies didn't. I am very very disapointed."
3,Packaging is a major disappointment,"The discs are housed inside cardboard, so that every time you want to actually WATCH one of them, you've got to pull it out and risk scratching it.This necessitates having to go and out and spend additional money on jewel cases, or something similar, to store the effing discs in.Otherwise, the set looks great, but that's a major annoyance, and I cannot for the life of me understand why Fox would package the set that way."
4,great,"this set is fantastic, great quality. why i gave it only 4 stars, is ""never say never"" is not there, also it would help to have a movie stero system for it, because you always have to hold your remote, because the volume is always changing.dialogue is really low and gunshots and action, music are super loud. all in all i like it."
2,Ridiculous Storage Container,"I, for one, would not consider ordering this set, regardless of price. The container wouldn't fit on any normal storage shelf and, having handled it first hand, the discs are very difficult to extract without smudging them. I don't think much thought went into the design of that container. Since I already have some of these films on Blu-ray and don't necessarily like them all, I will wait until they are separately available at a good price and buy the ones I want."
5,Bond 50:Complete 22 Movie Collection Blu-Ray,"The description of the product says there is an empty slot for the new upcoming James Bond movie,number#23,""Skyfall""{in theatres November 9,2012}.Does this mean they mail this movie to you when it is time for it's release to home video,or do you have to buy it separately first to put it into this box set?!For the price you have to pay you would think or would hope that ""Skyfall"" will be mailed to you free-of-charge for the very expensive cost of this box set, at least it sure would be an extra added bonus special incentive to want to purchase this very costly box set.Also among the new bonus extra features is there any new deleted footage from any of the films that has NEVER been seen before?!"
5,Not bad,"The price was very expensive to compare the original price, and the price for the chipping was désapointed because i was obligated to pick up by my self 2 days after! So.....I hope you can understand me, sorry for the english!!!!"
4,Wonderful!,Amazing package . . . with one flaw. The sound in one of the CD's is flawed. I would highly recommend this collection.
2,Verry happy with the product,I am changing my review. I have an external sound system and when I had that on and the sound of the TV completely off the subtitles/closed caption would show. Once I figured that out I was fine with those two movies. It was my bad. I have seen all the movies and I am very happy with the collection. I am glad that I am able to change this. Sorry for the initial review.
1,Does yours work?,We bought this pack for Christmas and none of the Blue Ray DVD's work in our Blue Ray Player. Its like they are all blank. The only disc that works is the trailer one. Has anyone else encountered this problem?
5,"Bond, James Bond, on Blu Ray!!",Got this from the Black Friday $99.99 deal...fantastic box set. Great audio and video quality. Any bond or action lover will appreciate the workmanship that went into this product.
5,"Fantastic ! My husband's Christmas was a success, he is a huge fan and I surprised him!","My husband hesitated to start buying these individually on Blu Ray because he has them all on VHS. He is a member of the Bond fan club and this has a bonus disc with interviews even he did not have. I asked him how he rated it, and he said the best ever!!!"
5,"Bond, James Bond","Great collection, a must for any Bond fan. Looking forward to watching the bonus discs. Looks good on the shelf too."
1,Unacceptable DRM,They've put some sort of new DRM on sevral of these disks (a few work) and they won't play in a number of Blu-Ray players that I have tried. Sony says that no update to their Blu-Ray players has been planned that will support the DRM on these disks and let them play. UNACCEPTABLE. Do not buy.
5,Live and Let Die Audio Messed Up,I am changing my review to 5 starts because I found out the product is as awesome as people say it is. I found I had a loose wire in my audio system which is why I was not hearing the dialogue track.
5,It's Bond... James Bond,"Growing up spy movies always had a special place in my heart, and this is a collection of one of the longest running spy so far. Great quality weather you buy the DVD or blu-ray. A great collection with a spare slot for Skyfall gives you a relief when you put the final part of the 50 year old series where it belongs. Great collection, worth owning and watching over and over again. Recomended for any James Bond fan who is looking to see those few movies he/she missed or just relive the moments again."
5,Bond 50,this was a gift to my husband but we have both enjoyed watching some of the older ones and realized how much we had forgotten of the story plots. They are clear and well done.
4,"Good, but could have been better.","As a set to honor Bond for 50 years its not bad. Some of the film transfers look better than others, but the bonus disc is a joke. I think it was under an hour of new material. Seeing that Sony, MGM and Fox worked together on this we could have had additional extras like the 50's TV version of Casino Royal included, or even the two unofficial Bond films. The 67 Casino Royal and 84's Never Say Never Again.The extras for the Brosnan films is pretty slight, most of the extras from the first issue of Die Another Day are not included."
5,Outstanding Collection,"This is an incredible Bond collection. It is one of those ""must have"" items. I am very pleased with the Blu-ray images on most of the discs. The re-mastered sound from the original sound versions is a bit of a tossup and perhaps that can be addressed with the type of home audio system you have.I was a little disappointed with the packaging of this set. Specifically, the discs may become scratched with the way the discs are packed and how they have to be handled to remove them and then return them after use. There are even signs on some of the discs that the manufacturer had a difficult time getting the discs packaged properly without getting surface abrasions on them. This is unfortunate and very discouraging. I highly anticipated the release of this set and I was a little disappointed. Yet, this collection remains one of those ""must have"" items."
4,Great Collection for Bond Fans,"I loved this collection. It came relatively quickly, even though I purchased near the holidays. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the discs were kind of difficult to get out of the holders. I am afraid I will scratch or bend the discs when I want to use them."
5,totally great,"terrific collection and a treat for the eyes! of course, this isn't oscar material, but as guilty pleasures go, this is right up there!"
4,Bond 50,"The set is great and my husband has all his Bond movies in one place. However, we had the first movie wouldn't work and when I wrote to you I was told it was out of stock and that I could get a refund. That meant I had to send the whole set back. Wasn't going to that so I just spent another $5 and bought a Dr. No separately and now its great."
5,007 doesn't look a day over 49!,"For those of us who could literally watch Bond movies 24 hours a day this is a great set. Fancy packaging isn't really required but this box set is nice with the ""Bond Girl"" photos accompanying the discs. I generally prefer to watch the finished product that the director put together for me so don't usually pay much attention to additional content such as extra scenes, interviews, etc. That said, I have looked at some of the additional content on these discs and found it very interesting."
5,Having them all.....,"I love bond...what more is there to say? To have it all, priceless! That's why I gave it five stars."
4,James Bond movie buffs,Excellent set of classic James Bond movies The quality of adio and video is is excellent in Blu-ray remastered version. It was an excellent value
5,Thank you,"Was a perfect choice, thanks again for the help!!! She loved it and has already started watching from the beginning :) couldn't of gotten a better present"
4,"Nicely packaged, and worth the price.","Husband was pleasantly surprised to receive this on Christmas, since Bond is one of his favorite characters to watch. Would definitely recommend to someone who was looking for this type of collection."
2,Poor Packaging and NO Extras,"The poor packaging of the DVD discs makes handling very difficult and it truly is cumbersome. I was surprised that you don't get all the extras that were included in previous releases. This being a 50th Anniversary collection, I would have expected there would have been an extensive array of extras. This is a major disappointment. My hopes were high. I am disappointed."
5,The most amazing 007's movie collection ever!,"It's a must to have it! Even if you're not so Bond's fan, because it's a precious harden edition of all 007 movies!A collection piece for everyone!I am really enjoying this!"
3,This box set is not your only option folks,"For those of you thinking of buying this box set, especially those of you who have already purchased the previous editions on blu-ray put your credit card back in your wallet. I just found out from the high-def digest bluray website that Diamonds Are Forever, Octopussy and Goldeneye are being released INDIVIDUALLY on October 2, 2012. That means the other titles will be out as well. I was hoping You Only Live Twice would be among the group but better luck next time."
3,Anxious,I bought this set even though I already have 20 of the 22 titles because I wasimpressed with the booklet packaging of all 22 movies. I was severlydisappointed to find out their was No reviews or explanations of the movieswhatsoever. I could not remember all the plot lines and have difficulityin finding out which title is which movie. I find two or three sentencedescriptions extremely helpful in deciding which movie is which. I wouldhope they would cocme out with a booklet that would have this informationand would fit in the box set case and be sold seperately. I know they willeventually come out with a collector's ediiton with this booklet included.How about giving us early purchaser a chance to get this booklet for oursets.
4,"Where is ""You Only Live Twice"" in BD?","Can someone please tell me why one of my favorite Bond films, ""You Only Live Twice"" is not available by itself on BD? If this is a complete collection, then a BD version must have been created, yet it's not for sale individually. What gives?"
3,Bond Forever,"I have been a life time Ian Fleming fan. First I had all the books and then all the VCR movies and then all the DVD movies. I have bought individuals and box sets of the movies. Obviously I am over 50 and a James Bond fanatic. I have all 22 movies, but at this time I have no interest in buying another complete set.Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection (with Limited Edition Hardcover Book) [Blu-ray]"
3,why didnt they do this in the first place???,I love the movies and love that they are all finally on blu-ray but they should have done this from the start. What am I supposed to do with the first three volumes of movies they released earlier????????
4,Bond 50 And still going strong,"I can't comment on the overall quality of this set. Since it hasn't been released yet, how could anyone for that matter? I own about 6 of the Bond films on BD, and pretty much all of them on DVD. I'll probably just buy the individual titles when they're available at reasonable prices. Incorrect info removed."
5,Bond 50 - Excellent Blu-Ray Set.,"I am enjoying my set of Bond Blu-rays. It is worth the price. Never Say Never is not part of the set for some reason, but all the rest is there. Plus there is a slot in the book for the new Bond Blu-Ray, SkyFall, when it comes out in 2013. I recommend it to any Bond fan."
4,Nice Package BUT,It is a nice set for the money but missing Never Say Never Again which regardless was still a James Bond Movie even though MGM may not have had their fingers in the till for it. Granted not the best James Bond Movie but should still have been included.
4,Polished,"Polished packaging. Would have liked more info on/in box...although it is there on the disks of course. Quality is high, including on oldies.Not so sure about the empty space to put the next movie in - that felt a bit like 'pushy salesmen'."
2,James bond,So far we have watched sevenmovies and of these two kept locking up and then jumped ahead. Very disappointing for what we paid.
3,More expensive before Christmas!,"I am happy with the product, but not the price. The price went up substantially before Christmas, which I am not sure why!"
4,Good gift,Nice collection for the movie lover. I bought it as a gift and it was much appreciated. Good quality of conversion to blu ray
5,James Bond... All of them!!!!,"Ok, so you love Bond and you love Blue-ray. Buy this, you will not be disappointed. The old Bonds are re-mastered to perfection. The quality is unmatched. I greatly enjoy watching my favorite films and seeing details I've never seen before. Also, there is a little golden nugget in this box set. A slot has been reserved for Skyfall because it was released in 2012. This makes the box set totally complete unless you count the film ""Never say Never Again"" [...] as part of the Bond collection. Never say Never was released after Sean said he would never act in a Bond film again. Well, he did, but in keeping his integrity they did not make it one of the bond films. If you want this film, you will have to order it separate.Buy this collection. You will be very happy!"
5,Fantastic Product,"I bought this set having only seen the Pierce Brosnan films, and Live and Let Die with Roger Moore. I have seen about 15 of the 22 now, and all of them have been fantastic. The only complaint I would propose is the fact that the cardboard holding the discs will see some wear and tear with frequent viewings of each film. The discs are not that easy to get out and get back in. Other than that very minor issue, I took the set for what it is: a journey through the amazing history of one of the greatest characters to ever be portrayed on the silver screen."
5,Bueno,I got this for my dad for Christmas and we really enjoy it. The collection is great to have and the quality is good.
5,Xmas gift,"This set is a Xmas gift,bond is not my cup of tea but it has nice packaging and cannot see any reason why a James Bond fan would not love this box set."
5,Bond collection,Gave this set as a gift and the recipient was very pleased. I thought the price was great; was offered as a daily special for $99.
4,Simple and sturdy package,"If your are really a Bond fan you will consider to have it on your shelf, even may be there are a few movie duplications in your collection. That's the inevitable thing for fans like us. Nothing much you can do about it. One thing you can do though, get it when the price is right for you."
4,Good ... could be better,Good set and great value for money as I picked the set for $99 during one of Amazon's Gold box deals. The hardbook itself could have been better as it is currently just a holder for the discs (with a photo from each film been the only contribution). Would have been nice if it contained more text related to each film. Anyway happy with my purchase.
3,The Spy Who Loved Me,"Unable to open and play. Once when did open, no sound. I have had trouble with about 10 of the 22 in the same way. Unable to find anyone to help. Thinking of sending back."
3,Good sets but worse packing,"I just receive my Bond 50 set last week. I feel excited and dissapoint, happy to receive the blu-ray set but was totally dissapoint on the packing."
5,A phenomenal box set!,"There's really not much to say...if you're a Bond fan who doesn't own all the films, this is definitely the way to go. Twenty-two pristine Blu-rays containing every Eon-produced Bond film. The only one not included, of course, is Skyfall...but there is a space reserved for it in the packaging! The quality of the films is astounding. Even the 50-year-old Dr. No has an unprecedented level of detail now! The discs are housed in two large books, in secure pockets etched into the thick pages, which includes film artwork. Overall, a nice, sturdy and beautiful way to present this collection. I've seen the price of this set vary wildly...ranging from the list price of three hundred to a less then half of that. Find it at the right price and it's a no-brainer if you love James Bond!"
4,Blu-ray Bond is stunning,"The entire set is wonderfully done in Blu-ray, enhancing the viewing experience of the Bond films which have held up well over time. I had to buy another set for my son's home."
5,"Great Movie, Great Gift, Epic Blu-Ray set","Great Movie, Great Gift, Epic Blu-Ray setI am a 007 fan for a long long time. This gift set make me happy all the time.i even bought one for my parents. They love it.Even my kids also love this after watching the new Sky fall."
5,The U.K. Version is $120 USD with Shipping,"Unless the price drops lower, I'll buy the import version. Listed as Region B so far...it could be region free and they don't always list that. Check the reviews once it's out before you buy if you don't have a multi region player. I'm trading in all my single discs for about $5 each to recoup the cost. If you want to buy single empty blu-ray cases, print out some custom artwork, and display them that way. Hopefully the discs will come in smaller cases to put on the shelf. Then I can put the outer box away or display it. The U.K. version is $5.45 per film. Not bad! I'm not going to keep waiting for individual releases which come out 3 at a time. To each their own."
1,"Fox Home Video, Major Fail","This is a major fail on the part of Fox Home Video. I was all hyped to purchase this set until I saw some unboxing videos of this set and it represents a major fail on the part of FHV because this is the same cheap and shoddy packaging that they used for the Star Wars Complete Saga set. It's too easy for these disks to become scratched and damaged and FHV did nothing to ensure that the quality of these disks would not get damaged.I gave this review one star because of the cheap packaging. Nice try, Fox Home Video, but we expect quality packaging, not the cheap packaging that's present in this collection."
1,Poor packaging and shipping,"The packaging for this release is predictably terrible. It's a storage nightmare and the disks are somewhat difficult to remove from the sleeves. Add to that the fact that Amazon simply dropped this $150+ set into an envelope for shipping, and it's a bad experience."
5,All Bond; All in One!,"My husband loved this set!!! He has been a big fan of ""Bond"" movies since they first came out. He had Video tapes and DVD's of them all, but now he is thrilled to have them all on one medium that will last forever, and can be kept together too!"
4,Good boxset,"I really liked all of the content this boxset contains especially since I never purchased the ultimate edition versions. All the movies look and sound great on Blu-ray especially the older ones. My only gripe is that the bonus disc should had have more new content that was given and the ""Quantum of Solace"" blu-ray is an exact copy of the DVD, they didn't even bother updating the title menus to match the rest of the films or adding any new content on that one."
4,awsome box set with great picture qaulity,"i have to admit, this is a great set and must have for any collector... the box set gives you 22 films with one bonus track and on empty sleeve for skyfall. The set includes 2 sets of books, each containing film releases from 1962-1981 ( book 1) and the second book is from 1983-2012.The bad side: well there is 2 -> one it doesnt include never say never again which sean connery starred in and 2nd its very difficult taking out the disc without somehow scrathing it. The blu-rays are really snugged into the sleeve where you have to kinda of pull it out and it causes some minor scratches. I give it a 4 star becuase of this reason. But dont worry,,,blu-rays are very durable compared to dvds and cds so minor scrathces wont affect play.....Overall its a must have and im happy with it and i only paid 130.00 plus tax so i got a good deal on it."
4,Good value for the Bond fan,"The Bond 50 Blu-ray collection is the definitive boxed set for all Bond fans. It contains all 22 films from Dr. No to Quantum of Solace (and with a space for the Skyfall Blu-ray when it comes out).Quality of the remastering is excellent, especially for the old films, which look sharper and clearer than it's ever looked.My one gripe is that the hardback books which actually house the discs make the discs a little hard to remove, and I can see that the paper may tear if you're too rough with it."
4,"Great Movies, BUT the packaging is a deal breaker.","I hate this type of ""sliding the disc into slots"" packaging. Imagine the wear and tear on the disks from usage. This packlaging will leave scratches over time. And the disk art is horrendous. I really hope that the disks themeselves have some type of art other than the name of the movie. Will be holding out for the single editions instead."
3,22 Movies? 24 Movies?,"Why not just settle this the easy way ... put a list of all the titles that are included in the set, and any discs of ""bonus material"". I for one enjoyed the bonus material in the DVD version, but recently upgraded to Blu-Ray. I wouldn't mind seeing ""Never Say Never Again"" in this, even though it's not an EON production and was simply a remake of ""Thunderball"". The Peter Sellers / David Niven version of ""Casino Royale"" was a farce, but I have to admit I have a copy to ""fill out"" my collection, as well as the Barry Nelson ""made for TV"" version of ""Casino Royale"" from 1954. EON is finally the sole-owner to all the rights to all the Bond productions, so why not include them in the set?"
3,Missing something,Where is Never Say Never Again? Is this not a Bond film also? Who edited this collection? Or am I missing something?
3,Not Sure.......,"I'm a longtime Bond fan but these collections can get a bit costly (sure Star Wars and LOTR fans can relate....).I remember when the entire Bond film series was sold in two collections on VHS to coincide with the release of Goldeneye. Of course, said collection almost instantly becomes incomplete the moment the latest film is released, so then the consumer must rebuy a new collection that includes the new film. How many copies of Dr. No does someone need to own? Of course, Never Say Never Again is NEVER included..."
3,Concerned about the box,"By looking at the photo it seems this set isn't going to sit well on the shelf with my other discs. Why do they keep coming out with these wacky shapes? Still, the price isn't bad."
1,One Bond movie still missing,"There are not 22 Bond movies - there are 23. Once again, Bond film #13, Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery from 1983, as been excluded from the collection. If you want the complete set, you'll need to buy this one separately. Make sure you don't get the flawed version with the missing footage as detailed in separate reviews of this film."
1,Of Course They Screw Those Who Have The Ones Already Available.,"Normally, I wait when it comes to sets this big because they always seem to release one or two, but not all before totally redesigning the packaging and re-releasing a larger set. However on Bond, they had the 3 packs, which I avoided, but then they started releasing them individually (about half of the series) or so, so I figured it would be a two phase thing. Of course, no, this time they roaylly screwed me as I have all the ones already available and have been waiting patiently for the second half to be released with favorites like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy... Now this, a complete set with most likely new artwork that will eventually be released individually, but of course, with the newer artwork. F them, I'm NOT buying. I already have every Bond film on DVD and they look good enough."
1,Bad Discs?,"I recently bought this item on sale, and now I know why, I think. Half the discs I've tried so far won't play. Is that why the package was on sale? What kind of quality control is in place?Caveat Emptor."
5,200U$ more in 9 days,"I wanted to buy this item, but raising the price from 129U$ in november 20 to 325U$ november 28, seems insulting..."
5,I'm in for the Bond 50 as a collectible..,"I already own 6 of the bond film on Bluray, but the price is still a bargain for me. The collectibles alone, the book and the posters and the box would already be worth a good portion of the price. The box design is excellent with the different Bond actors posed against the logo background. I'm wondering though why they would announce this so far in advance when there are still bond films on the shelf. It will probably put a damper on new purchases.One thing I'm hoping for though is that the movies are standard size cases. I like to have the option to store movies alphabetically on my shelf. The skinny boxes that sometimes come in these large sets don't give me that option."
3,Not Quite All,"Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again is not included in the set that includes ""all"" the James Bond movies. I don't care about the old Casino Royale being missing."
5,"Wowww... I love it, my wife.... well sometimes she lets me watch one ;-)",My set is now complete as of 12/12/13's release of Skyfall. Amazon is great both packages arrived on time and in very nice packaging read well protected for this collectable set. I think it is a must for any true 007 fan to own. BTW I also own the other is the original WB DVD 3 box set.
2,packaging is horrible!,"Yet again, MGM/FOX using cardboard sleeves to hold the discs. Half of my discs have scratches on them. The picture quality isn't great. I just think for the price they could've done way better."
5,a long time coming....,"you would have thought that a series as popular as this would have been already available. such was not the case till this anniversary set. i will not dwell on the movies or their blu-ray quality. what disappointed me most is the packaging. yes, the books have a elegant look and feel to them. but, the discs are wedged into a two per page slip case that just begs to be ripped when trying to remove a disc. i would have preferred slim cases (like matix anthology) making this set much more durable. and the new movie....how will that be offered?"
4,Great Price and Quick Shipping,"The product was exactly what my husband wanted for his birthday and he is super excited that I got this for him he wasn't expecting it- well kindof not. I ordered the item and waited in my in-box to remove the order information so it would be a surprise for him. I even made sure I picked up the package from the front door so he wouldn't have any clue about what I ordered for him. The only NEGATIVE was nothing to do with the product but with Amazon's promotional department. Why? Well two days before my husband's birthday we get an email saying ""You bought ""Bond 50"" you may like the following....."". He did see that one and was happy about the gift but felt bad that the surprise was gone. I was super annoyed and disappointed.... Thanks Amazon for screwing the surprise up.. I guess next time I will have to make a fake email up to receive all the junk emails from Amazon if I really want it to be a surprise."
5,Amazing,This is awesome I got it on sale for $100 on here a few months ago! I highly recommend it to any Bond fan. My GF and I are watching all of them!
5,Great set for Bond fans.,I was doing a Bond marathon when disc 4 stopped working half-way through the movie. I immediately contact Amazon and was authorized a return label. I was also immediatel shipped a new set. It arrived within two days and I have already return the defective set. Now I have to start at the beginning again in order to make sure all discs work properly.
5,Perfect!,"It's James Bond...on Blu-ray! What more do you need? This is a gorgeous set! My only complaint is that it doesn't fit on the shelf with all my other movies, but we just put it on top of the case to show it off."
5,great!,a must have have for anyone that loves James Bond movies.very pleased ! looking forward to collecting more James Bond movies!
5,Thank You Boulez,"If you are a fan of the ""New Vienna School"" (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern) or 20th century ""classical"" or ""serious"" music, this disk set is very rewarding. Beautifully recorded and packaged, and with equally good liner notes, it is a treat to strap on the headphones and listen.I debated between buying this or Boulez's older Webern set and went with this one. There is much more music on this set because pieces without opus numbers are included. They lend a lot of insight into his ""published"" works. I also went with this set because it is a modern digital recording, the previous set being from the early 70's. I will often side with a classic recording when needed-performance over sound. Here, I'm happy to report, the listener gets both. Every detail is captured.Thank you very much Pierre Boulez and DG for making this project happen. Please keep the Schoenberg and Berg disks coming. And thank you Anton Webern for continually opening my ears."
1,Misleading product. Does not work with a mac computer.,At first I was very happy to get this all in one printer. I needed the scanner more than the printer and the price was managable. The installation cd mentions that its windows and Mac compatable but that's big lie. When I put the cd in my computer all of the installation files only open for Windows and not Mac. I even went to the website to see about the drivers there and the site even mentions that this printer is only for Windows. I like the fact that the printer is lightweight and easy to use but it's totally useless to me if it only works for the Windows OS. Lexmark really shouldn't put the Mac logo on the box or installation CD if it won't work.
1,Open Cover Design Defect--Don't buy it,"I just installed my third new ink cartridge. They go fast, less than a hundred pages each. You get a message telling you that the ink is low after only printing a few pages.Anyway, when I closed the lid, the ""cover open"" message wouldn't go away, and the whole printer just locked up. I unplugged it from the wall and plugged it back in, and the cover open message was still there. I called tech support and they told me I needed a new printer. They emailed me a 20% off coupon, that you had to use as soon as you opened it, you couldn't reopen it. But Amazon has links to their website that say everything is 20% off there.Now I see all over the web that everyone is having the ""open cover"" problem. It is a design defect. Don't buy it."
2,Good for a year of light use,"First it said ""Cover Open"". When I finally fixed that somehow, it said ""Cartridge Missing"". When I got rid of that, the printer would not take the paper in the right way no matter what I did to it for a good hour or so. So, I would say, it lasted me about a year and a half of very light use before it started acting stupid, and now I will just have to buy a new one, but probably not Lexmark since I now have a little bias toward the brand."
2,"Poorly engineered ""cover open"" sensor","After changing the cartridge, my printer display showed a ""Cover Open"" alarm. I unplugged, replugged, tried everything. I Googled (fixyourownprinter.com seems to have the best repair instructions) and learned that this is a common problem, and not an easy one to fix. It involves removing the lid, possibly removing the scanner glass, reseating a lever rocker switch, and praying to whichever deity you believe in.What was annoying was that I'd used the printer so infrequently that it had been 12 months nearly to the day before I had to replace the first cartridge (I don't print much, and I still have a five-year-old Canon inkjet for heavy printing; I bought this for the copy/scan capability). This meant I went out of warranty right before the problem surfaced.The scanning and copying itself worked fine before this occurred."
2,Good while it lasted,"I had a Lexmark printer for 4 years, and I broke it (don't ask!). I needed a printer quickly, and my husband brought home this one. I LOVED it at first- it was small and took up very little space. The printing wasn't the greatest, but it did the job.However, 14 months later, the printer refuses to do ANYTHING. It won't even turn off. I've unplugged it, I've disconnected everything, and there is not a thing I can do about it. Lexmark won't help me because of course, my warranty ran out 2 months ago.I need a printer ASAP, but I don't know whether it will be a Lexmark..."
2,Useless ball hitch but otherwise good,"Very easy to install but to put a decent ball (eg 3/4"" shaft) on this adapter you must use the hole nearest the loop and ATV. This leaves very little clearance to attach a trailer of any size due to interference from the loop and the ATV itself. (I have a Yamaha Grizzly 660.) I'll be dumping this hitch adapter and buying one that is more well thought out. A waste of money if you really need the ball hitch."
1,DO NOT BUY - This book is not useful,"Mostly, this book is simply a rehash of material that is presented better in Sybase's own Performance & Tuning guide.Sybase ASE 12.5 Performance and Tuning presents little if any useful tuning advice. What advice is present ranges from flat out wrong (e.g. ""If Cache Search Misses falls below 20%, consider adding physical memory"" - page 288) to mystically useless (e.g. ""Create and use temp tables outside of each other"" - page 228).Further, the depth of coverage is quite poor. For example, there are only thirteen pages dedicated to locking, four to tempdb, and just one for log management (yes, only one page discussing logs!!).Finally, Sybase ASE 12.5 Performance and Tuning has many grammatical mistakes. Typically I can look past such a minor annoyance, but with this book's limited utility, this is the final slap in the face."
5,Don't go there without it!,"Murphy's ""A Birder's Guide to Trinidad and Tobago"" is newly released with new maps and updated commentary. These two islands have as many species of birds as the continental US. Finding even a couple hundred species during a self-guided trip requires this book. If you, a friend, or a loved one is going to the islands, don't leave home without it!"
5,Quite Lovely,"The packaging and the ring itself were quite lovely. Also, my fiance, who is ""comfort oriented,"" was thrilled with the fit."
5,"Great price, quality","I was leery about an online jewelry purchase, but this is a great quality ring that is a steal for the price offered. Same ring is $600-$800 in most jewelry stores. Comfort fit also feels great!"
5,Crystal Gayle CD,"I was very happy to find this,I checked record stores and old item stores with no luck."
1,No Depth,"I did not like this one at all. It sounded mushy and new-agey. I can't even see how it could be called Celtic. Maybe i'm just partial to a more traditional folk sound, but if you like something that is real contemporary and don't care if it sounds like celtic music, you might like it."
3,ENOUGH ALREADY!,"Will somebody please tell me why artists think releasing two albums is enough material to compile a greatest hits package? The only song most people remember from Portrait is ""Here We Go Again"" anyway. Also, why would an album have radio edits on it?"
4,A Review,"A definite MUST SEE...I mean, Yugi and Kiaba dueling and the first clash of the Egyptian God Cards...what's not to like!! I would, however, have to agree with J. Wimberly, this duel is about the most draw out ordeal ever...and this is a cartoon known for drawing things out! BUT, it is still a great duel between Kiaba and Yugi! Lots of counters and strategerization going on there...AND GOD CARDS!The flash back to the past is interesting and solidifies the destiny aspect. The part where Joey comes to Yugi in a 'dream'and points out his Red-Eyes is touching, if not a bit cheezy. But I have to feel for little Wokuba for having such a jerk as a big brother and hero. Kiabi really lays it on thick and deeply hurts the little guy who basically worships him. Which makes Kiaba's ultimate defeat all the better...the look on his face is priceless (even though, technically, it was drawn there)."
2,poor controls,This game isn't really all that fun and even to make it worse the controls aren't really good! So believe me only if you love Lara Croft alot you would love it. I have 1 final thing to say give it a rental so you can see if you like it or not.
2,A good video game concept wrecked by its horrible controls,"When we were shopping for video games, one guy at the store recommended ""Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation"" saying that it was one of his favorite games. So we immediately purchased this game, in hopes it was another fighting game with jaw-dropping graphics. When we slipped the disc in, I started playing, and it got overly frustrating. The controls are the most annoying part, and Lara's father can't even repeat his directions. I can only pass four of the training levels and that's it! The worst part about it is losing health underwater and starting all over again. The game is challenging, but it is way too hard to master."
1,This game is very bad,"I got bored of this game before I was even halfway through it. Repetitive gameplay, dull, flat graphics, illogical puzzles. There are loads more action/adventure games for the DC which will keep you entertained for far longer, like Code Veronica, Sonic Adventure...and there are more coming. Avoid this game;you deserve better than this lazy conversion of a lazy game."
2,"Been there, done that","I really liked the previous Tomb Raider games. So I was looking forward to play Tomb 4 as one of my first Dreamcast games. I heard the graphics are better than on the PC versions, better sounds, new features. Well, to make it short: The graphics have not improved considerably, the sound is nice, there are more or less TWO new features: combining inventory items and swinging on ropes. Everything else and I mean EVERYTHING is exactly the same as ever before. It's more a Tomb Raider 3: ""Egyptian Scenario"" except that you pay more. Bottom line: Eidos is simply squeezing the last dollar out of an old idea."
1,Not correct,"I received the wrong game as well as for the wrong game system. So I didn't get to enjoy the game, let almost try it out."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, to begin, i liked the thought of actually being Laura Croft. I mean, how exciting?! But, really hard. I got like past 2 or 3 levels and found myself really, inexpressibly stuck. I was like, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT?! So, away went that game for quite a while and i have yet to get back to it for fear of losing absolute faith in myself to play a game and actually win."
3,"Cats say ""It's only O.K.""","The furry houshold members are not too keen on this food. If I nuke it a little they seem to take to it a little better. I have to switch to other foods in between this to get them to finish it. Funny how cats can devour rodents, but turn their noses up at good food. Go Figure!"
4,Good Stuff,"Well, every cat is different, so I'm just throwing this review in to counteract the other negative reviews. I have 2 bengals, and they liked the Felidae chicken flavored dry food so I got the chicken flavor soft food, and they like it as well. If you're unsure about committing to buying this many cans, just see if you can find it at a specialty pet store near you.Also, their coats are much shinier, softer, and sleeker since switching to this wet food."
2,Uneven Effort,The Aliens show promise but lack what great bands have;focus. This album is all over the place in all the wrong ways. Robot Man is classic but much of the rest of the album falls flat. This album has a couple of songs that are mix Cd worthy and that's about it
1,"Besides ""Shes a Beauty"" this CD blows.","IF this is their greatest hits, then I would hate to see their other songs. Yuck."
2,Not as described,"I was very disappointed when I received this. It did not include the shoes as shown, the detailing on the jacket was different, and there was no badge. It did come with some type of paper Teddy Bear Sticker that was floating around in the bottom of the bag, but the glue on it was old and cracked and looked like it came from my grandmother's attic. If this was intended to be the badge on the jacket, there would have been no way to attach. In fairness it is durable, just not what was expected or ordered."
5,High quality hook,"We ordered a bunch of these hooks, along with other styles. They are durable, high quality and worth the money. They snap into place and can be easily moved. I was surprised at how much weight the various hooks will hold. One piece of advice: order more hooks than you think you'll need, because you end up using them. HIghly recommend the hooks and the channels. Our garage is highly organized now."
2,Wish I would have known...,"I did not relize that I needed some kind of pegboard to stick this to. I was pretty disappointed. Now it is sitting my my garage not getting used, I would look else where, not worth the money."
2,Doesn't deliver,"Don't let the pretty pictures fool you. This guide is poorly written and very hard to follow. The sample files would be more helpful if the tutorials were more complete. Note: THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR DUMMIES. The author must have worked so hard at keeping the book compact, quality suffered. It is densely packed with cryptic text. New terms are introduced in nearly every paragraph without proper definition. Seemingly important concepts, such as S-Meshes and Metaballs, are entirely glossed over without a mention of how. The book may be worth the price for the last 3 chapters: ""The Interface,"" ""The Buttons"" and ""The Appendix."" The rest left me disappointed. You may learn just as much about Blender -- if not more -- from the web."
3,"Essential, but . . .","For anyone trying to learn Blender, this book is essential. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have a lot of problems. Firstly, the book covers an old version of Blender and hence doesn't document any of the new features such as NLA. Secondly, it's a very poor translation by someone who clearly isn't a native English speaker. Some of the lengthly passages are almost unreadable. The index is also quite poor. However, as the software doesn't include any documentation and as it's difficult to cull sufficient information from the Internet, I would defintely recommend buying it -- warts and all."
3,Not enough,Although the color printing was impressive and helped me visualize the outcomes of the exercises the instructions often left out a step or two. In addition the short hand notation that is used to refer to short cuts in Blenders was often confusing. That said the book did help me learn the basics with the incredibly cryptic Blender interface.
3,Not that Good,"the first thing I noticed (second day) was the pages started falling out of the ""book"". Its not actually bound like a book, more like a fat magazine. As for the content, the author tells it like it is up front when he says ""this book is a TOUR"" of blender. That word is the key. Its not an in depth analysis, it won't answer all your in depth detailed questions, but it will give you a tour, or overview of blender. For detailed how-to's go to the tutorials on the net. This book is not worth what they are asking for it."
1,"A hateful book, well worth avoiding","I am sure someone likes this book, but not I. I found the drawings uninspired-- not bad, but not great either. However it was the nearly utterly pointless and boring story that makes this a total drearfest. It's like a grey, damp chilly fall day-- it's just a big fat downer. I thought it would be cool, something my children would like, but they all hated it too. No story, lousy vocabular, unimaginitive-- and the production values of the book itself weren't that hot-- pale images, and coarse paper. Overall a really crummy book experience. I recomend not even bothering with this in the library, and certainly wouldn't suggest it for purchase consideration."
4,Lots of windows and doors!!,"There are more windows and doors than you can use in this set. You would need to buy additional sets to use all the windows and doors, otherwise your house will be all windows and doors.I liked the cute little fences that this set came with, too."
4,Another Great Lego Product,"This set represents another great Lego product. With alot of emphasis on themes like Star Wars, this set is one of the few that is good for young girls. The container is durable and great for holding all the parts. I bought this as gifts for a niece and nephew -- both really enjoyed it."
2,deceiving image,This product is not what I expected. It is a tiny little bottle of a zillion tiny legos. I would not have ordered it had I known more about what I was getting. The bottle is smaller than a gallon milk jug. I cannot imagine that Amazon is getting this price for this item. I paid$[...] with shipping from one of Amazon's partner sellers and I wish I hadn't bought it.
2,lots of windows,"I don't know if it was just my box but I got 20 windows and doors, I wish it had different pieces. I feel like I got jipped!I can't build anything but a big house full of windows with a fence around it and trees."
3,Lego building set,"I expected this item to be substantially larger. The pieces are very tiny and are easily lost. Additionally, young children must be watched extremely closely to ensure that pieces are not swallowed. The construction of the house is time-consuming. This toy would probably be perfect for children who enjoy a challenge and have a decent attention span (and/or an adult with a decent attention span to assist the children)."
4,Jerzees,"Nice T-Shirt. Heavier than I wanted. I thought perhaps these shirts ran small, but they don't. I probably will order more, just a smaller size."
4,The Only Shirts I Wear,"These shirts are great. They're good for any weather, not too light or heavy. The sleeve and tail lengths are just perfect. My only thing is that these shirts are available in any Michael's Arts & Crafts store (they sell them to be used to make tie dye shirts) and Walmart I believe for around $3, so check those stores before ordering them here."
5,T-Shjirts are Great,This t-shirt was great. I really liked the variety of colors to choose from. This shirt also washes well.
2,Scratchy cloth feel. Quite loose and big.,I'm 5'6 and got the medium. The cloth feels tough on the body and overall it just seems too big for my taste.
3,ordinary Tee shirts,Very average quality on the low side. They sure have the color selection but not great in quality at all. Thy are very mediocre quality but the price is cheap so what can you expect. They are OK but nothing to rave about..
4,Outstanding live reggae?,"Believe it; amazing, but true. This album is not the cleanest in sound quality, but it does what live albuns are supposed to do -- capture the excitement of the live date. And the music is good; very good. Far I is of course always hypnotic. This date draws that out perhaps better than anything else I have heard him on. The tracks are long, which means they can set up a groove, and then Far I can just go and go. There is a certain sameness to the material; it's not a perfect album. But a couple of the tracks are of the highest caliber, standing next to the elite of all time in the genre. ""Brujo Magic"" will amaze you -- it's trippy, entrancing, and matches a kind of disco-y, ahead-of-its-time spacy quality with Far I's most gravelly, haunting, droning, and chant-like vocal style. A fine purchase."
5,Good Speakers,"I got a great deal on these speakers, so for the price they are good speakers. However I think that the alpines are a little over rated on their wattage, 50rms. But they can't take that much. The tweeters sound very crisp and clean though. Good speakers."
2,"A Traditional Narrative History, BUT...","Miller's study of the Berlin Airlift is a standard, chronological examination of one of the most famous episodes of the Cold War. However, the author makes virtually no use whatsoever of Russian-language sources from Soviet archives -- a significant omission given the relative availability of Communist-era records opened since the collapse of the USSR. Students and scholars alike will have to wait for a more balanced account of the operation..."
4,Vintage McBain,"I read many 87th Precinct books early in my life.The main characters are still in place with a few new names.The descriptive style McBain applied always cleared one's visionof the people, places, seasons of the year.An excellent series with guaranteed plot twists and always one, or more,detectives in a jam."
2,For the fan,"Typical early 87th Precinct mystery with a horrendous pun for the title (the ""Boys"" of the 87th find a large cut-off hand in the first chapter). McBain in this period has a horrible tendancy to overwrite (the three page description of the ""City"" as a woman was excruciatingly purple) and play cute (several times the characters make references to either entertainment or novels, in an early and poor attempt at post-modernism). Introduced in this book is Juan, the Puerto Rican addition to the 87th, as McBain slowly trudges towards diversity, thirty years earlier than Bill Clinton.(Sorry about this review being on here twice--I originally posted it years ago before Amazon kept track of reviewers.)"
2,Typical 87th precinct novel--for the dedicated fan.,"Typical early 87th Precinct mystery with a horrendous pun for the title (the ""Boys"" of the 87th find a large cut-off hand in the first chapter). McBain in this period has a horrible tendancy to overwrite (the three page description of the ""City"" as a woman was excruciatingly purple) and play cute (several times the characters make references to either entertainment or novels, in an early and poor attempt at post- modernism).

4,Anthropology ember,"Fast shipping!! I got it sooner than the date prompted. Item was as described and good condition. The only problem was the package didn't have a tracking number, it got me alittle worried. Overall GREAT seller. If you decide to buy the later edition to Edition 13 of CAROL R EMBER, I recommend you getting this one instead of the new one save you money and it has almost the same thing as the 13th edition! So if your wondering if you should get it like did, I recommend!! I'm glad i did!!"
2,Lack of feedback,I sent an email stating that the book was ordered by accident. I stated to them that I made the mistake and asked them to let me know where I could return it and receive the correct one. I never got any feedback or anything.
3,This is a STUDY GUIDE!,"I had to return this purchase because this is a study guide, not a used textbook. I did not see it shown as a study guide at all. Very frustrating. It looked like a good study guide, but not really useful to me based on my instructor's syllabus."
5,Anthropology 11th edition,"It took a little while to arrive, about 2 weeks so I had to catch up on the reading for class but this book saved me a lot of money. Compared to the ridiculous prices in my school bookstore. I payed, with shipping and handling, about 6 bucks and the school was selling the 12t edition for 102 dollars, used! The only difference between the 11th and 12th edition was a few pictures. Same written text, same material."
4,Quite a teaser!,I got this book because it was in a reading list of a homeschool curriculum I was interested in. It has many classics stories and others I grew up with and wanted to share with my kids. What I didn't know is it has only one chapter of each classic in it! It's been quite a tease and left me hunting for my library card to check out the entire book of the chapter I was reading!!!
2,average at best.,"I find it hard to believe that so many people are giving this five stars. In my judgement 5 stars is the highest rating you could give and album and that means its a masterpiece. There is only a handful of albums that deserve 5 stars, pink floyd's the wall, and maybe more recently NIN's the fragile and radioheads KID A and Amnesiac. Maybe I just outgrew this type of music or I was looking for ""old school"" KMFDM. Do not buy this new if you do purchase this."
2,"Not bad, but that's less than i expected from Sascha & Co.","I'm not gonna say that this album is bad, because it really isn't. But it certainly isn't great. It's hardly average. It's standard output from a dead industrial band. I loved the majority of KMFDM's output over it's 15 years, with the exception of the bland Nihil and the thrash-obsessed Angst. There are a few standout songs on here, like Witch Hunt, Stare at the Sun and probably Torpedoes, but the rest is pretty much filler, sub-standard for Sascha and company. I expected more, especially after last year's fantabulous Adios. No more to be said."
3,MDFMK still ripping the system,"MDFMK picks up where KMFDM left off. Without a doubt this is one of my favorite albums now. From the hypnotic sounds of Lucia's voice to Sascha's enraged voice this Cd flows to perfection. The best song in my opinion is WITCH HUNT. From the orchestre to Sascha's not too subtle message about how artists are used as a scapegoat for violence in young america. If you think that Sascha & co. might not have it anymore, you will be pleasantly suprised.Mdfmk still ripping the system & now guilty by assosciation!"
4,the future will be synthesized? hmmm....,"i too feared that this cd would be merely a continuation of KMFDM's long career, mainly because i thought their albums were getting alittle stale toward the end (but they used more techno beats :)). what i found was a maturation of the KMFDM sound. it was less formulaec, and more experimental. But not experimental in that it was just random noise, no; their style merely loosened up allowing for more messiness and noise blending, but Sasha and Tim's experience gave them the skill to manipulate the newly created messiness artfully. The buzz-saw guitar riffs and crunches melt and fold into the lyrics and beats while the electronic components accent the song at all the right spots. Each part tumbling and rolling into the other. its one big beat blasted bouliabaise. lots of fun. ""Torpedoes"" is amazing!"
5,Top notch,"This is a great CD to buy because it fills in the gap of 'Adios' and 'Attak'. The songs are great, and the rhythms are awesome. I especially love 'Rabble Rouser' with the angry yet cool sounding vocals, 'Torpedoes' with it's catchy rhtyhm which you can pretty much dance to, and 'Witch Hunt' which has a really catchy chorus. Hopefully MDFMK will make another album, though I am very excited about KMFDM's new album 'WWIII'. I don't care who releases an album first, they will both be great. Great going guys!"
2,Bring on the noizzzzzzze... (yawn),"It feels like KMFDM are trying too hard here to be erm... run-of-the-mill hard rockers. A disappointing album with great sounds (breakbeats, voice distortions & hard guitar riffs) but it doesn't quite pull it off convincingly. Exceptions are ""Now"", ""Rabblerouser"" and ""Hydro-Electric"". Luckily this was a temporary lapse and they soon returned under their real name with more of the good stuff. Oh, and I missed Brute's artwork on this one. Skold disappointed when compared to his contributions on ""!@#$%"" and ""Adios"", and Lucia sounded like a bad addition to the line-up. She would later find her proper role in the ""WWIII"" album."
3,A might catchy...but a bit Skoldie.,"I'm inclined toward the general consensus: Skold is best in small doses.Even so, this album is good vindication for the fans who know that KMFDM began as a synth band, thus never `went techno'. Wired collectors might be more satisfied than the strapped, particularly those that complain of having to skip through previous releases, but we need twice the Lucia and half the tim. General Electronic aficionados, being pretentious progressives by nature, will already find a number of the e/affects to be dated, but side projects ferment into nostalgia in shorter time.Specific emphasis: The best tracks are well worth a used price."
3,Cha-Ching,"KMFDM was never there to make money, after the demise of KMFDM it seems as if everyone's favorite Kapt'n needed some coin. This is to put it simply Sascha and Tim-Tim's attempt at mainstream music. Not that that is a bad thing, it's just that if you were here expecting KMFDM you will be dissapointed. This isn't a bad album, but it's nothing fantastic. There is A LOT of synth on this album, more than anything by KMFDM. I'm not a big fan of the electronic parts, but occasionally when the guitar kicks in I'm all over it. If you are a casual music fan buy it, if you're a KMFDM fan buy it soley for a komplete kollektion. Who knows maybe you'll enjoy it..."
3,"This is not as good as their ""first"" album, Nihil","I can't believe that ""true KMFDM"" fan actually thinks (or thought) Nihil was their first album. He/she/it is thtupid. KMFDM peaked with Naive (first pressing) but managed to stay relevant with follwing albums Money, Angst, and their ""first album"", Nihil. Those are all great albums and the albums that followed were forgettable as you could tell Sascha was getting bored with the old Wax Trax crew. This new album is more of the same. Industrial is dead so pick up your old FLA albums and rock on."
2,Why they released such album?,"Po tym, co Sascha Konietzko i Tim Skold robili pod szyldem KMFDM (choby na albumie ""Symbols"") z niecierpliwoci czekaem na album MDFMK. Nieobecno En Escha i Guentera Schulza nie zmartwio mnie zbytnio, bo sdziem, ¿e Sascha Konietzko spokojnie da sobie rad sam.Tym czasem album pod ka¿dym wzgldem rozczarowuje. Gitary ndzne, riffy primitywne, a loopy, delikatnie mówic, nienajlepsze. Co gorsza wszystkie te elementy poskadane s w sposób, który mi osobicie niezbyt odpowiada. Co prawda jest kilka utworów, które mi si podobaj, ale wystpuj w niewiarygodnej liczbie 2, co przy 10 utworach daje tak, a nie inn ocen. Spraw sobie przyjemno i kup inny album."
4,MDFMK will never stop!,"In one word, awesome. Absolutely incredible work that Sascha and Tim did on this album. From the opening track 'Now', the the greatest closing track of all time, 'Witch Hunt', it is a non-stop rollercoaster of guitar, electro, and vocals that are outstanding. Lucia does a great job on many of the tracks, but best of all on 'Get Out of my Head'. If you were a fan of KMFDM, or are looking for a great band to start listening to, MDFMK is your one-stop shop for the best of it all."
5,Simply incredible,"This has to be the most incredible album I've bought recently. It's not like KMFDM, but it's the same in many ways. KMFDM is dead, and long live MDFMK. It's a lot more heavy than KMFDM. The guitars are a great effect, but they are only an effect. With KMFDM the guitars were more like ""I'm Gunter Schultz...here's what i can do *insert hard as hell riff and solo*"" Tim Skold is a nice addition, but i do miss En Esch's growling. Sasha K. is a musical genious and everyone who enjoys music should get this album. Oh and the female vocals are great as well."
4,The Evolution of KMFDM,"Great big hello to all you MDFMK/KMFDM fans from the wintery depths of New Zealand!!! I've been a completly avid collector of KMFDM works since '98 through each of their albums I have seen a huge ongoing process in change in Sascha Konietzko and co's music using every single piece of available hardware to produce the best he possibly could, I salute the guy! (Not in an evil way, They are an art form.).When I heard The MDFMK album I was amazed, this album had true variety and diversity in it. There's everything from the massivly metalic rhythms of WITCH HUNT, to a track everybody can enjoy in STARE AT THE SUN or there's the two tracks that put skatie's punk bands to shame in RABBLE ROUSER and GASOLINE.All in all this is an album I think lovers of all diferent music styles can enjoy and find exciting and innovative years from now.Send me your thoughts at; king_mullet@hotmail.comRIP THE SYSTEM!"
4,MDFMK is a solid but limited album ...,"Don't get me wrong, I love KMFDM, and think Sascha Konietzko is a near genius BUT there is no way that MDFMK can compare to the amazing ADIOS album. True, MDFMK does give a consistent sound that may have been lacking in KMFDM, but the guitars (supplyed by Tim Skold) do get repetitive at times (all his guitar work sounds the same ... Gunter Schultz's guitar sounds/capabilities are limitless). However, this isnt supposed to be the new KMFDM album ... this is MDFMK - hardcore attitudes and insane beats. (I could go in detail with each track ... but almost all are good, espicially 'Hydroelectric')Also, to the reviewer that said all KMFDM's work in the 90's sounds like one long album, do you even own a KMFDM record?"
2,"The King is dead, long live the king","The idea that people seem to believe that this is really anything different than what we expected from the corroboraters involved is rather amusing. That people would suggest this is a straying from the KMFDM formula is odd. This album is no less KMFDM than any album is. People first said Angst was to guitarry, then Nihil was to different, then Xtort, and so on. If we make a baseline average for the Sascha and Co ""sound"" , then no album strays from the baseline any more then the rest, and this is no exception. So should you buy it? Well, how much KMFDM do you have. the more you have, the more you need this to fufill the collection. And yes I enjoy it. But it's not a miracle to me. And I'll buy the next one the day it comes out too!"
3,MDFMK is not KMFDM,"I must say that it is hard to throw in an album, hear sascha's vocals and NOT see a Brute! drawn cover. I got over it fast with Nihl, being as how its a masterpiece, but i could hardly say that about this album. Is it bad? No. Is it better than Adios? Yes. Is it KMFDM? No. And that's what i keep forgetting. Sascha lost the sound, the brute artwork, and the cast, but what about the name? I want guitar solos, horns, a rotating cast, and the cartoon covers i expect when i think of the letters KMFDM(no matter what order they're in)! But its not going to happen...KMFDM is dead...long live MDFMK! (sigh)"
4,Not Classic but still Brilliant,"This is really what I expected: KMFDM a little bit progressed.The album sounds fantastic, the known KMFDM sound, a little bit more polished, but still wild and powerful. That is nearly perfect in other words. Some of the songs have also great ideas. There are some tracks that I like more (eg ""Torpedoes"", ""Hydro-Electric"", ""Witch Hunt""), but I do listen to the whole album very often.It may never be a ""classic"" album, but it is still a brilliant album.I really cannot understand people that complain about KMFDM have changed. Everything I have liked in KMFDM sound is also present in their latest albums, and in their ""transformation"" to MDFMK, too. Fans,... proceed!"
2,It broke in my hands within 20 seconds,"I wanted to buy a non-battery dependent flashlight for my car and my wife's car. The idea of having a built in AF/FM radio was a great bonus. I couldn't decide what I wanted, but for only $5 I thought I'd give this a try. I actually ordered 3 different units, all Kaito. I bought the KA004, the KA005, and the KA404R. I took it out of the box and began to fiddle with the switches and buttons. The back end telescopes out and twists for radio tuning. I snapped it right off by accident. This might be a decent novelty item, but you do not want to trust something this cheap for emergency use. For $5 was too good to be true!"
4,"Not Too Bad, just works !","I bought this radio by search for emergency radios, and it came on time by the seller. I like it, the tuning nkob is interesting, it turns the speaker to use it, and pull the speaker to change volume.It works well , and the pulling dynamo is an interesting feature that you can use for emergency, the price is good too...I give it a 4 star."
4,Arbitrary Selection,"Most of what's on the 7-CD set is classic. But some of the little bit that I'd throw away from that actually ends up on here.Bottom line the 7-CD set is so moderately priced that you shouldn't bother with this arbitrary selection, you should go get the whole feast."
1,Picture does not explain very well.,"The railing bracket is made from good material. When we hang it on the railing however, the bottom of the bracket leaned down 45 degrees, so the box would fall out.I emailed customer service and never received an answer.I paid for the return freight plus a restocking charge.A very costly exercise."
1,yucky buy,I have a metal rail on my balcony so it didn't fit and I bought four of them :( So dissapointed.
5,Awesome!!,"An ATT repair""person"" installing U-Verse in my home had one of these. She let me use it and WOW!. NO more knuckle busting. Had to get one! Couldn't believe I found it, and for $10! If you ever have to deal with COAX connections, this is a must have!"
4,Great but....,"This tool has a great design concept in that the cable is routed through the center of the tool. This means there is no flipping the cable over the handle every turn like you have to with the offset t-handle types. However (there's always a however eh?) the throat behind the hex opening is too narrow to accommodate most quad shield sized compression terminators (at least not the three types I use). Not a problem if you have a rat-tail file and about 10 minutes to file the throat wider but if not and you use quad shield cable, probably not for you."
5,F-CONNECTOR INSTALLATION/REMOVAL TOOL,"Thick, strong plastic with a metal recessed socket for Cable F type connector nuts. Does an excellent job of easily tightening & loosening those nuts.Simple to use but a real effective little tool and it gets into fairly tight areas. Simply slip your cable TV line into the slot and slide socket up to the nut. Save on those fingertips or using the easiest tool handy, usually pliers, these fit perfectly and the funnel design makes for just the right torque.Ordered Sat. Dec. 29th received Monday the 31st! Fast Shipping! Received by USPS in a small envelope.Doesn't say on the wrench that they are Made in the USA, but I suppose they are as it has the patent no. right on it.Not that they don't have a US patent but were actually made overseas.Holland Electronics, LLCUS Patent 6.817.272"
3,Fat fingers,I have big hands and trying to use this tool just interfers with my fingers. I think I'm just not used to it. But then again not used to being old either lol. It is convenient in certain circumstances. But working on a security DVR with 4 camera inlets is really tight. When there's 2 up and 2 down it's good but 4 accross and working over head. Blah.
1,disappointing,"A poorly written travel diary. Little of interest to the traveller or the tourist. Politically correct misinformation. Bell should read Paco Iyer's Video Night in Kathmandu which did a much better job of illuminating the self-absorbed, insular world of the backpackers that stumble around Asia."
3,n-Verter,"I got this to use in the car with my laptop. The first one I received failed but when I told them, they replaced it immediately. The replacement worked quite well for months. Then it fell apart in the cigar lighter and melted some wires. I guess it's a design flaw that the most vulnerable part which extends into the cigar lighter is held together with a small threaded ring. It seems like you'd expect something which is pushed in and out of a tight hole would eventually come off. And it did. It should have an on off switch also because it remains on while in the socket. So you are forced to remove it when not in use increasing wear and tear and the natural resultant failure. welloh... Thanks and good luck."
5,Underated game,"This is in my top two favorite games of all time. The story is engaging. The world is fantastic looking. It's like you get a shooting, platform, puzzle, fighting, rpg, mystery, game all in one. It is like the ultimate game. If I could make a game I would make this game. It has David Bowie songs in it to. From one of his best albums. How can you go wrong?"
2,Unhappily Disapointed,"When the game first came out I thought that it was going to be in the realm of Soul Reaver which has extremely good graphics. But after playing the game the graphics were less than spectacular and more to the realm of comic strip. It did not have the great control and speed that it should have for the game, the controls were haphazzard."
1,Mountain Bus,"This old 70's band was a backup band throughout there brief history. I seen them a number of times in Chicago backing up the likes of Ted Nugent, Rory Gallagher, and other Aragon Ballroom headliners. This album and band reminds me of ""Pure Prairie League"" If you like that kind of music then this might be for you. The three times I seen them in the 70's they didnt get a good responce at all from the crowd."
3,Good Introduction But Go to the Sources,"This book along with Moorehead's The White Nile are good introductions to the European exploration of the sources of the Nile; however, he also goes one step further and includes general history of the region, most especially Egypt, during the same time period. I expected most of the book to describe and discuss the explorations for the source of the Blue Nile; I really didn't want to read about Napoleon and other well-covered historic figures who really had nothing or very little to do with the actual down and dirty exploration of Ethiopia, The Sudan, and the lower part of Egypt. Please read the book and then go find the journals or specific biographies of the persons, such as Jame Bruce, who were actually down near Lake Tana and explored the interesting areas between Lake Tana and Aswan."
4,An interesting book,"This book traces the history of the socalled 'Blue Nile' from the early 18th and 19th centuries forward (the 'Blue Nile' is the stretch of the Nile running from Etheopia to Alexandria). The book focuses on the exploration of the region as well as the wars, including that of Napoleon fighting the Mamelukes, and how he later was ousted by the English and the Turks. There are also many vivid and detailed descriptions of various tribes on the lower Nile, and, as always, Alan Moorehead has an instinct for colour, detail, and action. It is a worthy sequel to 'The White Nile', although it is understandably difficult to find the equals of such characters as Livingstone and Stanley who loomed large in the first book. Still it is well worth reading and superbly entertaining."
5,HISTORY ALIVE,"This author brings alive a history that is most relevant in today's Egypt and today's world. Together with his book ""The White Nile"" Alan Moorehead shows the setting for Egyptian history."
4,Color is LIGHT coblt,"These dessert dishes are just a nice size for Jell-O, pudding, fruit, prep. dishes, or dying Easter eggs (clear is a better color for that task). I was hoping to match them to cobalt dishes I have and they will ""compliment"" the dishes rather than match them. Price was great for these versatile dishes."
4,great only if you want only 10 hits of Johnny Rivers,"If you are an extremely casual fan, this 10 track collection is the way to go as it does have most of his top 10 hits but to make this perfect for the top 10 hits only crowd, the #26 hit Where Have All The Flowers Gone, should be taken out and be replaced with ""Mountain of Love."" The ""Best of Johnny Rivers"" CD available at BMG (used copies do appear on Amazon.com as well) is a better choice for the casual fans and/or fans who want a definitive single disc collection for traveling and for the diehard fans, the 2 CD ""Anthology"" is a much better option. Another essential hit from his Imperial years is ""Summer Rain"" so avoid this collection and either get the 1987 ""Best of"" CD or the 2 CD ""Anthology."""
3,Good collection stuff missing,"Not only is Mountain of Love missing, but so is Summer Rain. It's not a complete collection without these two songs."
1,crowd noise,I like Johnny Rivers but the crowd noise detracts from the music. Live performances are great with crowd noise at the beginning and at the end but this CD has talking and clapping all the way through the songs.
5,GREAT CLASSIC ROCK!,"Johnny Rivers is a favorite when it comes to classic rock and great guitar songs, you can really enjoy this cd."
3,It's fantastic because Rivers is fantastic (but it's not the greatest collection),"This album is great because Johnny Rivers is great.But, it's a flawed collection for reasons mentioned here. For me, the biggest flaw is that it's missing a few songs.However, the price is right and not a bad place to start if you want to discover this fantastic guy who getting neglected a bit by history."
5,Johnny Rivers Greatest Hits,A very good CD very good shape great songs I would shop at Amazon any time thank you Amazon
3,Mountain of Love,"Nothing fancy, Just good old songs. Miss the fact that Mountain of Love is not included amongst the titles."
3,"Where is ""Mountain of Love""?","This would be an excellent 'greatest hits' release were it not for the very obvious exclusion of Rivers' ""Mountain of Love."" Why this ommission?"
4,The Killer Angels,Good story. Fascinating characters. Very good job of describing the strategies involved and the action of battle.
5,A Beautiful Piece of Writing As Well,"At times in this wonderful novel the author's narrative approaches the realm of poetry--sometimes I had to read a line several times, so great was its beauty. Don't let the word ""poetry"" turn you off, however. This is not a ponderous, pedantic novel. It is an absorbing, rich read and a painless source of detailed knowledge about the Battle of Gettysburg."
3,"The Killer Angels, By: Jenna Villatoro","I will tell you now that The Killer Angels is in now way an easy read. But, once you get into it, the pages turn faster and faster. Shaara's writing style is very descriptive and unique. His style is definitely what I liked most about the book and made it fun for me to read. I am not the kind of person who can sit down for 3 hours and read but The Killer Angels was, surprisingly, easy to get back into. The descriptive tales of war brought to life the scenes and took me back in time. Shaara's novel took me about 1 month to read and it was difficult but now I know why so many people said it is so good. I definitely recommend this book even if you are not into history because I am certainly not."
2,Ok,"Received book, finally. Seemed like it took a long time. when we did get it (needed for school assignment) it was not like new or good, but yellowed."
3,Not as good as expected,"The reviews were very good, that is why I bought the book. Moved back and forth from scene to scene/character to character too much, not much character development. I didn't feel like I got to know any of them well. I'm reading Gods and Generals now. Much better book."
5,Incredible,"Those who criticize this book should try and write such clear genuine prose. Every sentence is a masterpiece. The story grips you as Shaara invades the minds of the generals on both sides of the conflict. Truly, one of the best American novels ever written. Let every aspiring writer attempt to emulate Shaara's style."
5,So Real I Thought I was There!,"Rarely does a historical novel, fiction or non-fiction bring characters to life with the depth that Michael Shaara imparts into this novel. I actually felt like I was standing on Seminary Ridge listening to Longstreet and Lee. I developed an undying respect for Chamberlain and finally understood what the Civil War was about to those who actually fought it.In an age where everything is grossly over-hyped, I will call this book an incredible piece of work since it was written over 100 years after the events it covers and probably explains them better than all other books about Gettysburg combined.Worth at least twice the price!"
3,A book for Civil War fanatics (not me),"I really wanted to like this book; I got bogged down in the middle as the battles just kept going, which I suppose is the point. War stinks.I'm not a Civil War fanatic. I've read a few books, and studied it as a typical high school student, etc. I appreciate the breadth of Shaara's research, and the detail he includes in this epic tale, and recommend it to anyone who loves history, especially the Civil War time period. If you're a CW fanatic, this is one you should definitely include."
5,fiction at its best,"Floridians can be proud of this contribution to the literature of The War Between The States. The Battle of Gettysburg is the scene for this conflict between heroes on both sides. General Chamberlain makes his mark here, the man that U. S. Grant selected to receive the sword of surrender at Appomattox. This is historical fiction at its best and no one who reads this book will ever forget it."
4,Civil War Made Real,This book makes you feel that you are right there on the battle field. You can almost smell the smoke and death. An excettent insight into the minds of the generals.
5,Civil War Comes to Life,"When I picked up this book, I really knew little or nothing about the Civil War or the major players. I knew Lincoln, Grant and Lee, and I knew which side won.I'll admit that I expected it to be a snooze, but I've seldom been more wrong. I was actually so interested in the characters, that I looked up photos of them so that my mental picture would be accurate. It's not easy to make blow-by-blow battle accounts engrossing, but Shaara manages this and more. Even though I knew the outcome of the battle, this was still a suspenseful account.One book won't make me an expert on it, but this novel really brought the Civil War to life for me."
5,A Masterpiece,"""The Killer Angels"" is a riveting tale of the battle of Ghettysburg. The pure emotion and moral struggle General Longstreet endures while trying to reason with General Lee is heart wrenching at times. This book was hard to put down and brought tears to my eyes on several occations. A must read for any Civil War fan."
5,A must read,"This book really is a must read for history buffs or anyone who just enjoys good writing. Shaara's words leap off the page and draw a picture of Gettysburg the reader cannot resist. When he writes that General Longstreet ""smelled disaster like distant rain,"" so does the reader."
4,A Killer Book,"The Killer Angels by Micheal Shaara covers the most important days of the Civil War, the 4 days at Gettysburg. Shaara shows besides the war tactics and maneuvuers on the battle field there was something much more important presented off of it. Friendship, love, companionship, these were all elements of life that kept men sane and althought these were intangible things, they were casualties of war as well. Overall I thought the book was well written and gave you an aspect of the war no one has shown before."
5,Riveting Account of Fascinating Events,"The Civil War always fascinates and as time goes on seems less real in the fuller context of American History. The 150th anniversary of the war did not get much attention from mainstream media outlets that I can recall (of course, my powers of recollection are not what they used to be) but this book has provided a unique perspective that such sources would not likely have been able to provide anyway.After re-reading The Killer Angels following my recent reading of Gods & Generals, I came to appreciate Michael Shaara's work all the more. While G&G; is excellent, Killer Angels is the superior work. In allowing one to empathize with its characters, setting out the complexities of the historical context and relating the emotion of the players, Killer Angels may be one of the most effective historical novels ever written."
5,HISTORICAL FICTION IS FUN,"Loved Killer Angels - written by a dedicated writer who knew his stuff. When will we get more fiction like this? I've just read GETTYSBURG... OTHER TIMES, and though not in the league of Shaara's masterpiece, I did enjoy very much this new historical fiction on the great battle.GETTYSBURG... Other Times"
5,A real page turner couldnt put it down,This is probably the best most inspiring book about the civil war I ever read. Its combinations of Northern and Southern views blended with the sights and sounds of battles made me think I was really there. This is the most heartfelt inspiring book I have ever read
5,A masterpiece about life and human nature,"Killer Angels is one of the best books I have ever read. It is so much more than just a ""war book"". It is a book about life, faith, human nature, and the agonizing tensions that we all must face in this life. Everyone in a position of leadership should read this book."
5,Great book,"I bought the Kindle version and read it in 4 days. I am now on the Shiloh book. ""Killer Angels"" is a must read for any Civil War buff!!"
5,More than names and numbers,"I am a Cadet Candidate at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School. For far too long, the Battle of Gettysburg remained nothing to me but names and numbers in a history book. After reading The Killer Angels, I gained a whole new perspective on the events of that battle. Names now have faces, actions have background, and I understand thelong and tedious process each decision had. The characters have voices, from which I can learn lessons from the past. As a student of military strategy and leadership, as well as a veteran, I view this book as a true exhibition of duty, honor, and patriotism."
5,Great novel of the Civil War,I first read this book after seeing Gettysburg in the theater. I thought the book was great how you managed to get into the thought of people you only read about in history. While historical fiction I feel that what was said by the characters was true to both the person and the time.Strongly recommended for anyone with an interest in the Civil War and US History.
5,Best Civil War Novel Ever,"This book was the basis for the movie ""Gettysburg,"" and it's easily the best Civil War novel I've ever read. The novel covers the battle of Gettysburg, wich each chapter written from the point of view of a different person.We see the battle unfold, with the armies coming together in this quiet Pennsylvania town. During the book, we get a close look at some of the officers of the two armies, their backgrounds and how they reacted to the events.If you want to learn something about Gettysburg, this would be a fun way to get started."
5,Men of Honor,"The main characters in this book come alive. As I turned the pages it's as if I could feel the sun beating down on my back in those July days of 1863. I sensed the fear the soldiers must have had as they contemplated the charge that ended the battle. I felt the fatique of Robert E Lee, the humble courage of Joshua Chamberlain, and the pain of Armistead as he lay there dying, thinking of his old friend. If you are wondering about what it felt like to be at Gettysburg, read this book."
4,Killer Angels,"I ordered this book after having seen the movie ""Gettysburg"". I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and even though it is 4hours in length, it was a wonderful way to remind us of our heritage and how many people were touched by the war. I am giving the book and the movie to my son for his birthday. Thanks to Amazon it is so easy to order products and receive them in a timely manner."
5,A Great Novel,"This is the greatest novel I have read, maybe ever. You don't have to be a history or Civil War buff to appreciate the human emotions brought out through the story. Very well written; I was drawn into the men's lives and could feel their energy. I felt especially empathetic for Longstreet, towards the final battle, when he really knows (I mean he KNOWS) what is going to happen to his men when they charge up the hill, but he has to give the order to advance anyway. Any writer who can make you feel so strongly for their characters and sit there telling Longstreet not to do it!! then in my opinion, they have created a masterpiece of literature. Bravo."
3,Great story - Terrible accent,"I listened to this while on my way to Gettysburg and it is a fabulous story. Highly recommended. However, I had a very, very difficult time not shuddering each time the narrator attempted a Southern accent. Has this guy ever been below the Mason-Dixon line? I've lived in the South for half my life -- quite a bit of it in Virginia -- and this is not how we speak. The work of Shaara is so brilliant it makes up for the flaws in the narration, but just barely."
2,Talkingburg,"There is much to like in this novel, but it is my least favorite Civil War. All I remember about it is officers talking and talking. And the descriptions of the fighting have little impact. You never feel the blood and horror. I could care less about the generals, especially the venerated Lee. I want a novel that focuses on the poor grunts who did the fighting and dying."
3,boring in the beginning and boring at the end,"When I read The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara it never really grabbed my attention. I think that it was very confusing to someone who doesn't know much about the civil war. It did, however, give very detailed accounts of how war is. I think I would appreciate this book more if I knew more about the civil war or if I were a little older and liked to read. But I'm only a teenager so I didn't like it as much as someone older than me."
3,For readers who like wars,"This book talks about four days of hell that many soldiers had. These were the four most bloody and courageous days of their lives. James Longstreet is severely wounded in the wilderness, but he quickly returns to be Lee's most dependable soldier, his right hand until Appomattox. Robert Edward Lee has poor health, and he serves until the end of the war and dies of a heart disease. Richard Ewell serves with courage until the end, but as a corps commander he is fated never to achieved distinction. Ambrose Powell Hill never took part in the Richmond society he so dearly loved and so richly deserved, Five days before Appomattox at the battle of five forks, he is killed bya sniper's bullet. John Bell Hood loses not the arm but the use of it, it remains withered within his pinned sleeve for the rest of his life. Dorsey Pender is wound grows and grows steadily worse, his leg is amputated and dies"
2,This book is a challenge and it's difficult to understand.,"I was assigned to read this book, The Killer Angels,over the summer for my sophmore History class. Now, I hate war stories so this is the last book I wanted to be reading over my summer vacation, but my teacher gave rave reviews of the book, so I figured it may not be too bad. I started the book and found it boring and confusing right from the start, especially because I am not too familiar will military terminology. As I read on though, I did find some positive points throughout the story. I enjoyed reading the parts that explained about the soldiers lives and personal thoughts. I thought these parts were interesting and I wish there would have been more instead of all the battle descriptions. I guess that's not really possible though since it's main focus is the Battle of Gettysberg. One thing I know for sure after finishing this story is I would never read this book voluntarilly, but that's just me. :)"
4,War is Hell,"Michael Shaara takes us through the Battle of Gettysburg in sharp detail from start to finish. Not knowing that Ted Turner's film Gettysburg was based on this book, it became obvious after just a few pages. As I recall, the film is true to Shaara's book. Shaara's characters are presented brilliantly from start to finish; these are the men who defined the course of our nation during this bloody encounter in Pennsylvania. Shaara's novel is a painless way for us to learn about this important event in American history. When all is said and done, Shaara's book reminds us at a time when we sit on the brink of war that, as always, ""war is hell."""
5,The greatest Civil war novel written to date,"I have several great civil war novels, but this takes the cake. It is written with a genuine understanding of the Generals and others characters it portrays. My favorite book of all-time. As an additional comment to anyone who enjoys this book I suggest renting the movie ""Gettysburg"" based on the book. It is equally as compelling."
5,This book makes you feel like you're in the mind of Lee,"This is the greatest book I have ever read, I personally finished this book in one day. I just couldn't put it down. Anyone who buys this book is making a right dicision. I have read The Killer Angels and I am look forward to reading the other book published by both Micheal Shaara and his son Jeff Shaara; Gods and Generals, The last full Measure."
5,Great book,This is the best book written about the Civil War and the battle of Gettysburg. It is a masterpiece that is still studied by the U.S. Army.
5,Great Book,Love the story of little roundtop and 300 men charge an ocean of men and won. What a in depth look at a critical time in our history.
5,Excellent reading,Very easy to read and an excellent novel all around. Enjoyed the different perspectives in the great battle of Gettysburg.
5,great book,just great writing. you dont have to be a civil war buff to love this book. it's about the people
5,Kill Kill kill kill..............,I Want to take the writer of this book and kill him. By putting tape on his arms and then just quickly tearing it off.And then when you think its all over I'll drop him in a giant vat of CREAMED CORN!!!!
5,Absolutely amazing,"I first came across this book 3 years ago while taking a U.S. History class in college. It was required reading for the course,but somehow,like many people at that point in life,I managed to get around reading it and still pass the class. Wow. Little did I know what I missed out on for the last few years. I recently found the book in a storage box and decided to start reading. I never put it down. It has replaced ""The Godfather"" as my favorite book of all time.The way Shaara puts you there at the battle is incredible. What I like best is that it portrays the perspectives of both Union and Confederate figures,and it doesn't try to demonize the Confederacy,and I guess on the samenote it doesn't try to show the Union as completely angelic either. I love the movie adaptation of this book as well. If you're reading this and are considering picking this book up,what are you waiting for?Do it right now!"
4,What They Thought,"Let's face it. History books can be boring, even when the event is something as glorified and action-packed as the Civil War. Readers remain detached from the stories, and the historical characters are defined by only by their distant accomplishments.Michael Sahara bridges this gap by letting us into the minds of the men who strategized and fought the epic war, using their letters, journals, and some guided imagination to create an absolutely gripping account. We learn about the burdens these men carried...in their military duty and their personal lives. He also successfully conveys the fear that ran through the young soliders as they approached a battle they were certain to lose.With this book, Sahara places himself in the upper echelon of the historical fiction genre."
5,Amazing Civil War Novel,"I have studied the Civil War for years in school, but they were all dates, statistics, names, not real. It didn't captivate my interest until I read this novel. It is an insight into the Civil War that you can't get from reading textbooks. The author portrays both the generals and the battles in a way that kept me reading until the end. He doesn't have any bias toward either side, which is rare in the Civil War books I have read. A must read for anyone because this is our past in a way that will please all and offend none."
5,The best historical novel,The best historical novel ever writtenEveryone should be able to say they have read this book!
5,Best historical fiction novel,"This is without a doubt the greatest historical fiction novel of all-time. It does not matter if you are a Johnny Reb or a Billy Yank, you will be filled with respect and awe for both sides. If you enjoy history, this will be your favorite book, guaranteed."
5,Old reliable...,If you want to put a face to the American Civil War start here. Sits on my nightstand and have read it over a dozen times to date.
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"Through The Killer Angels I learned things about the Civil War that I had never imagined. I actually felt that I knew Longstreet and Chamberlain by the time I finished the book. If you never read another book in your life, you need to read The Killer Angels. The literary world lost a master when it lost Michael Shaara. I am an avid reader and it would be safe to say I have probably read thousands of books in my lifetime. No other author has ever made me feel the way Michael Shaara did. This book will be a permanent edition to my library."
5,Present History,"With this book, Michael Shaara has become by far one of the greatest storytellers of American history. Not only is this novel hard to put down, it is hard to read only once. Shaara has the ability to put the reader on the battlefield with all the generals and soldiers, allowing you to smell the smoke from the cannons and hear the screams above the gunfire. As an American, I feel closer to the history that made this country, and I have Michael Shaara to thank for it. I only hope he'll delight us with more work written on other great moments in American history."
4,no need to be a Civil War buff,"For the non-american reader as I am, Civil War is a simple matter of blue coats fighting grey coats on the movie screen, and probably the only other book about the subject in life was Gone with the Wind. That's why I was amazed about how enthralling this novel his: I devoured it as it were a spy-story and subsequently I tried also the movie that I found perfectly satisfying. Everyone who feels the fascination of the battlefield with an emotional and an historical approach altogether should read this book (and see the movie that doesn't betray the novel)."
4,Must Read,"Actually, I've been meaniing to review this book for quite some time. This is one of my favorite civil war books.Anyone who was totally confused by the lack of presence of Buford in the movie and who doesn't own the director's cut will find more of his actions in the book.Historically, it is fairly accurate. Of course, only diary excerpts and letters can recount the conversations, etc., and they are usually not exact, word-for-word retellings. Some of the conversations used in the book were taken from retellings by one of the participants. General Ewell and RE Lee, for instance. Others are completely created dialogue. It's impossible to know which if you are not a civil war expert, which I am not.The Killer Angels is a wonderful place to start."
4,Filling the Historical Holes,"Shaara brilliantly depicts the pivotal battle of Gettysburg through the eyes of both the generals and their staff and fictional characters based on historical information. I found most scholars to agree that this book is very accurate with a few liberties taken, and it gives a good impression of what the confederate leaders dealt with in their preparation and execution of the attack.I read this for an assignment at work, and my boss gave me the recommendation with the quote, ""It's one of those books that's so good you wish you could forget it and read it again."" I found this to be true, and it's a good tool to learn as well as enjoyable literature.If you enjoyed Pressfield's Gates of Fire, than this is definitely one that you need to check out. It is not really biased toward the north or south, so it's also a good representation of balanced history."
5,Very fun!,"This book is a blast. Fun, fast paced, accurate, ... no words.The novel works even if you don't know anything about the American Civil War (tested it on some of my friends in Brazil who didn't).Wish Michael Shaara had written more, but I guess the labor it took to write just this one was enough. The works of Jeffrey Shaara don't come even close (they are OK, but this is very close to perfection)."
1,If Mystery Science Theatre 3000 did books . . .,"Simply horrible! It is filled with cliches and mixed metaphors and did nothing for me on any level. Nothing rings true in this story: not the characters, not the battle, not even the small talk. You'll either laugh or cry, but you'll recognize it as just plain bad. Read it to be amazed that it won a Pulitzer Prize!"
1,This book sucks!,"I had to read this book for my tenth grade honors history class. I had heard from several other people that this book was outstanding really gettin into the character's emotions, rather than all the factual stuff, like ""They marched five miles north, turned, marched more"", and that type of crap. That sounded pretty good to me because I'm not into that type of thing. So I decided to give it a whirl, and see how I like it. I read it, and I hardly got anything out of it. That's about it."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS,"I guess it's not really Michael Shaara's fault that ""good Civil War Novel"" is an oxymoron; but it doesn't make up for the fact that he can't write. This is the worst book I've read all year (except for Cannery Row--you can see my review of that, too), and if you read it and like it you are mentally ill. I'm sorry. (Okay, no, I'm not.) The worst thing about this book and the circumstances surrounding it is that Shaara's son, Jeff, who grew up hating his father (who drank himself to death), then took advantage of his father's success with Killer Angels and wrote The Last Full Measure and Gods and Generals--sequel and prequel (not necessarily respectively). CARPETBAGGER!! (No pun intended.)"
1,The Worst Book Ever written,"I despised this book! It was absolutely horrible! It was assigned as a summer reading book and it was just so bad! I enjoy reading books, fantasy, historical fiction, mystery, and even nonfiction! It was really really bad. I never want to read another book by Michal Shaara ever ever again! I never even want to hear or see the words Killer Angels again."
5,A masterpiece of American Literature,"As far as historical Civil War novels are concerned, I used to think that nothing could surpass the brilliance of Bruce Catton's ""A Stillness at Appomattox."" Well, I picked up ""The Killer Angels"" after watching the movie ""Gettysburg"" on the July 4th weekend and I have to say that this book is now number one in my mind.Imagine someone writing a book in the year 2055 about the D-Day invasion and this book being unlike anything that you have ever read before about this much written about battle. It doesn't sound possible, does it? Well, Michael Shaara has done the equivalent of this with regards to the Battle of Gettysburg.This is a unique, fascinating, moving, beautiful novel. It's one of those ones that I will always recall when I reflect on my favorite reading experiences."
2,The killer Angels,"This is a great book for an advanced reader. The book contains great images and realistic scenes. While reading this book a student is most-likely to get confused on the way the book is set up. There is a lot of action in this book and that's whats make it that interesting. However, I would say that this book should be read in highschool because of the way the book is set up and the words are a little advanced. Reading this book has helped me learn a lot."
2,Could Have an Enduring Work of Art,"A writer this good should have had a great editor who could hold his feet to the fire and show him some matters of craft that a few of the best writers of today employ. Shame, shame, shame."
2,Quick service but misleading,Book was advertised as a Hard Cover and I received a paperback.Service was great but just didnt receive the right product.
3,Learned Allot Despite Character Development Problems,I didn't know much about the Civil War and could care even less. This book made learning about the battle of Gettysburg easy. What I hated about the book was the one dimensional characterizations of the main players. May Generals back in the days of the Civil War were flat but don't make me read about them.
5,The Killer Angels,"A great story of an horrific battle of the Civil War, shared in first person by many of the main participants from letters and journals. More Americans need to read this and visit Gettysburg to better appreciate what our country means and meant to the 500,000 that gave their lives."
4,A Glimpse Into The Civil War,"Michael Shaara has a very good style of writing that is easy and entertaining to read. To me, reading this book provided a glimpse into the Civil War similar to the way that HBO's series ""Band of Brothers"" provided a glimpse into World War II. This was a very good book to read."
5,The Killer Angels,"As a self-described ""History Nut"" I found The Killer Angels to be the best book about The Civil War I have ever read."
5,Brought the Civil War to life,After many years of interest in the history of the Civil War I was amazed to be surrounded by the characters that were there. The lifelike and authentic portrayal of the people and events was wonderful. This novel was an absorbing emotional experience lending some understanding to the question of how so many casualties could have occured in such a short time.
3,Angels in the Battlefield,"Confusing and boring, I thought Killer Angels by Michael Shaara was an ok book. The story seemed to drag on at some points, but usually got back up to pace. Being a person who doesn't really like history novels, I do believe that this one was one of the better ones I have read though.The story is about the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War. Each chapter is about the two different sides and the different generals in command. The thing I like about this book is that it explains each general differently and gives what their thought might have been during this time. This aspect of the book made it a little easier to follow. Though the different chapters were laid out according to the generals, I thought some chapters were a little confusing and dragged on.Even though I rated this book only three stars, I did learn more about the Battle of Gettysburg. I wouldn't recommend it to many people, only those who like boring history books about the Civil War."
2,I don't get the ratings,I really thought this book was boring. I don't understand how people think this book is so wonderful.
2,a waste of time,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. If it had a mildly good plot, I might understand. This book is about Gettysburg, and their is not one word aboutthe Gettysburg address, which is all anypeople rememberabout Gettysburg anyway. Slow death by boredom.Signed, A.B. 9th grade."
5,Very moving & exciting book!,"I've always loved history, but didn't really think much about the Civil War until I read ""Killer Angels"". After that, I was hooked!!! I read it before and after my first extended visit to Gettysburg, and it really opened my eyes to this incredible story. The best part of the book is that it humanizes icons of the war, like Lee--and it also introduced me to Civil War figures I never heard about--John Buford, Lewis Armistead, Winfield Scott Hancock, and (my favorite) Joshua L. Chamberlain. Mr. Shaara humanizes these men, with their fears, doubts, anxieties, etc.; to me, it is the strength of the book! Thanks to this wonderful book, I have become a ""Civil War nut""--thank you, Mr. Shaara, for giving me a new direction in my life! P.S: I've also read his son Jeff's books GODS & GENERALS and THE LAST FULL MEASURE; while they may not be up to the same high standard as his dad's book, they are still good. Of the two, I like LAST FULL MEASURE better."
5,Excellent Book!,Everyone needs to read this book! It is one of the best historical fact based novels ever written. I have bought many copies to give out to young adults interested in history and older adults that wanted to learn more about history. If you are planning to go visit Gettysburg this is a must read before you go.
3,big tdawgs sweetness book review,"I thought that The Killer Angels was fairly interesting. Although this type of book isn't usually my genre, I decided to try it. When I started reading this book I had the picture in my mind that everyone associated with the Confederate Army were horrible people who just wanted to treat slaves like animals. After I read this book I respected the confederate army. I understood that the Confederate army was just fighting for the only way of life they knew. I think that this book is beautifully written, but it isn't really something that I am interested in very much. Although it isn't the kind of book that I would read again I highly recommend this book to anybody who likes reading about the Civil War or who likes the historical fiction genre. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that likes an intense, fast paced book, because this book goes at a fairly slow pace. I award this book three stars because it was greatly written but it got boring after a while."
3,Wonderful book. Flawed narrator.,"This is a wonderful book to read but a terrible audio book to listen to. The narrator is so affected and languid sounding that it drains the energy from the novel. I could not have imagined anything taking away from the action of this book but the narrator's voice is so slow and languid that it's annoying. Almost sounds comical at times. I can only guess that they wanted it to sound genuinely ""Southern"" but I come from Texas and never heard a southern accent like that, except for Blanche DuBois. Really too bad because it's a wonderful book."

4,"Excellent, but difficult to follow","I just finished reading Shaara's novel Killer Angels this morning. It was an excellent book, filled with insight into the PEOPLE of the war, not just battles and historical data. However, the way Shaara presented the information was difficult to follow. He jumped from character to character, ignoring major figures like Ulysses S. Grant and General Meade, skipping to more minor figures like Chamberlain. I have to admit, however, that skipping to Chamberlain was brillint, IMHO, in the way of literary poetics. If anyone has thoughts on the book, please feel free to email me at Licorice33@aol.com."
5,One of the most beautiful books I've ever read.,"If I could convey, in a review, the heartbreaking beauty of this book, its grand sweep and lyrical elegance, I should be as good a writer as Michael Shaara, and I'm not. My favorite chapter describes the 20th Maine marching toward Gettysburg, and all the thoughts rolling through Joshua Chamberlain's mind as he walks. Incredibly beautiful. And I never read Armistead's description of his last meeting with Winfield Hancock without tears. There are few books that I think everyone, absolutely everyone, should read...but this is one of them."
2,Never finished hard to fallow,I read a lot so when I have a problem getting into a book I know it is probably more the authors fault than my own. I found the story a little hard to follow and a little disjointed and didn't end up finishing the book as I quickly lost interest.
5,WOW!,"Great Read! Took me four late-night reading sessions. Fast and Disturbing! Thought provoking. Personalizes and colors the Civil War's history and characters. Crystallizes the carnage and sacrifices. Only reinforces the ""Brother-on-Brother"" killing. Blurs any hardcore, non-sadist's historical political opinion. Reserved in my 'Memorable Books' section."
5,Clearly one of the best books I've ever read!,"With some knowledge of military history, I read this with trepidation. As an African-American in the US Air Force, and living in an area where many battles were fought, I was unsure of the content (anything about the Civil War), but elected to read it. I was not disappointed, in fact the battle was brought into focus of what the war was about for the North...to set other men free. This was more than just about a battle, this was about individual men and ideas, how each believed their cause was just and that God was behind them. I was in awe. Especially of Joshua Chamberlain. This is a must read...but do read ""God and Generals"" first to bring it into perspective before Gettysburg and what each major character truly believed."
4,Definitely expanded my education...,"Michael Shaara is a very eloquent writer- I was very impressed with his style. I now have a new insight into the intricacies of war. He didn't glamorize it and he succeeded in making it very real to those who have never had the war experience. I look forward to reading one of his other novels and expanding my mind all that much further. I didn't give it five stars only because I had wished that he could have given more detail as to the personalities of all these historical characters. It was very enjoyable & educational though admittedly I will generally recommend it solely to my male friends. As a woman, but not a extreme feminist, I would have to say men would more likely to be drawn to this story & it's subject matter."
3,A strange Cat,"When I was younger, back in my redneck days I actually listened to, and owned Cat Stevens ""Greatest Hits"". Which was a little out of character for me. I was never a real Stevens fan, but I liked that old 8 track; I think that is what I had. Well, I was searching through some older CD's on Amazon and came across old ""Cat"". My old tape is available on CD, so I was going to order it, when I noticed this CD. Wished I had ordered the ""Greatest Hits"", because I don't care for any of the other material and I find myself listening to the same old tracks that I listened to all those years ago. For real Cat Stevens fans, this is probably a good CD, but not for me. I find that I skip over way too many tracks on this one. He certainly had some good songs, though, and they're all here. You be the judge."
5,A Tribute To Cat Stevens!,"Before Cay Stevens made the decision to convert to the Muslimreligion he had enjoyed a star studded career.He was one of thebiggest names in music during the 1970's.This album cpatures anoutstanding career.Featured on this CD are such hit songs as""The First Cut Is The Deepest"",""Wild World"",Morning Has Broken"",""Moon Shadow"",and ""Another Saturday Night"".The one song that Imost relate to Cat Stevens is ""Peace Train"".This was a hit during my senior year in high school.I have never forgotten thissong.As a fan I definitely miss the songs of Cat Stevens.Thanks for the memories Cat."
3,Stick with the originals,"No compilation of Cats 'best' work does him justice. This might be a good 'intro' to his work, simply because of the number of songs, but if this is the only album of his that you own, you dont know what you're missing."
5,Best-sounding Cat Stevens CD,"Excellent song selection (although one could argue for a few stellar tracks that were omitted), fine booklet with comprehensive notes, and by far the best sound quality of any Cat Stevens CD. The one unreleased track, ""I've Got a Thing About Seeing My Grandson Grow Old"", from 1970, is certainly an equal to his better material and would have fit nicely onto any of his early 1970s albums. An excellent starting point for he curious or retrospective for long-time fans."
5,Peace strain,"Like many people, I was disappointed when the artist formally known as Cat Stevens, called for the death of Salman Rushdie. But his Muslim fundamentalism should not detract form the fabulous music that he created in his youth. His style seemed to grow out of the folk tradition but had a rock beat. Like much of the work of the 70's, his songs have quite a few hidden meanings behind the sometimes confusing lyrics. For me though, it's the strong melodies that make his work so good. It's just a pity he retired so abruptly. Please note: If you've already got his ""Teaser & The Firecat"" album, I'd think twice before buying this album, as many of the tracks are the same."
3,The missing songs ....,"Where are the two more well sung and strongests songs by Cat stevens, THE HURT and LATER from the Foreigner-1973???"
3,Take the bad with the good,"This emphasizes that Cat Stevens' career didn't genrate all that much hit-worthy material. There's some really good stuff here, but only half the material is listenable. I'd have been better off just to have bought ""Teaser and the Firecat""."
3,Cat Stevens; The Very Best of...,"O.K., this has some of the songs that we all knew and loved from Cat Steven's continually progressing inventory. One of the things that made Steven's music interesting is that he was always on a path, his style was constantly evolving. This ""Very Best"" gathers samples from his evolutions from 1976 to 2000. Some very notable songs like ""Ruby Love"" and ""How Can I Tell You"" are missing from these titles. And some of the versions of songs such as ""Hard Headed Woman"" can be found with much more punch and syncopation in earlier releases. So if you want to get to know the unique Cat Stevens style, this is a good place to start, just don't think that when you have this that you have collected all of his ""Very Best""."
5,The cream of Cat!!!,"This CD contains 20 great examples of Cat Stevens great music!!! A treat from start to finish!!! All of his big hits are here in this collection,with great remastered sound!!! Nice booklet too!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+"
2,Revisionist History Which Affects the Music,"If CS/YI just sang love songs, maybe his politics would be irrelevant to the music. But he doesn't, so it is. Make no mistake, the VH1 and other mumble jumble he's spouted during the promotion for this record is a lot of hooey - he was asked time and time again to clarify his remarks after two book publishers were murdered for putting out Rushdie's book and he refused. Nor has he ever said he *disagrees* with what he was ""simply quoting."" How people can listen to a song like ""Peace Train"" or ""Wild World"" and force that from their minds is hard to understand, outside of nostalgia or historical interest... (By the way, anyone notice that everybody votes against the negative reviews no matter what they say or how they say it? Fire away!)"
3,Both Sides Now,"Cat Stevens wrote some truly memorable songs in the 60's. Songs that were actually part of the generational sound track. He hasn't done much of public mention since then except make stupid and possibly misinterpreted comments concerning death to artists who are percieved to insult Islam. Did Cat Stevens support the ""fatwah"" directed toward Salman Rushdie? Does it matter? Mr. Stevens is unwilling to unequivocably state that he did and does not support the ""fatwah"", and no interviewer has yet pinned him down to an answer. Does it matter? Personal choice. It matters to me, and besides, you just shouldn't try to sing out of both sides of your mouth. It garbles the message."
1,Sure Sounds Different Now,"Strange, but now that I've lost my celestial image of him and see him as the Islamic fundamentalist who agrees with Khomeini's death sentence passed on Salman Rushdie, those same songs that once seemed so innocent and sweet just come across now as being a bunch of pretentious musical gimmicks aimed at the same kind of mass appeal as a TV commercial jingle. The only song I still love -- Morning has Broken -- is just the re-wording of a beautiful old church hymn (Praise of Thanksgiving) of the same tune. I prefer the hymn. Hey, Cat (or Yousuf, if you prefer), if you insist on hurling your thinking back into the dark ages, at least stop trying to market yourself as the New Age hippie we once thought you were. You can't have it both ways."
4,Why can't we just enjoy the music for what it is? Just music.,I really enjoyed the music on this cd and consider it one of my favorite cds. This collection needs Sad Lisa and a couple of other songs maybe. It is disturbing to see some of the reviews that focus on the political/religious side of the artist. Do you really aggree with the politics or religion of everyone you listen to?
4,New Cat fans will enjoy ...,"The world over, Cat is known as a legend. Why? Simply because he wrote some of the most beautiful music. Where do you start if you are new to his music? This album, also known as 'Remember' in other countries, happens to be a good place to start. Much, much more songs than on the original 'Greatest Hits' which I have also reviewed. It's nice to see a track from his album 'Foreigner' here whichis an album overlooked on Cat compilations. Although the track is only an excerpt, it is better than nothing. My favourite track of all time 'Sad Lisa' is missing from this compilation. Naturally, they can only fit so many on, but 'Sad Lisa' is one of his VERY best, so it's omission does not go by unnoticed. 'Two Fine People' is also missing, but there are still stacks of goodies on this album to please everyone - Sitting; Morning Has Broken, Peace Train & Where Do the Children Play. Worth having, and treasuring."
5,Awsome.,"I'll be honest, I am 18 and I listen to many different types of music which includes new rock/punk/etc, but this CD is pure gold. It's very rare nowadays to hear an artist create a bunch of catchy songs, you only hear the most popular on the radio. BUT THIS CD's every single song is incredibly catchy and original. My fav CD over anything else."
3,Cat,I gave this C>D> to my husband for Fathers' Day and he was very happy. He especially liked Father and Son. It does have some mening for him!I was glad Amazon had the C.D. with this song on it and many more that we grew up with as teens. Thank you!
3,Pitchblende - 'Gygax' (Matador),"Barely remember this part industrial, part alternative metal band. Definitely hit a small nerve when I ran across a couple of their '90's releases I haven't seen in awhile now. Tracks that weren't bad to check out include ""Squeezin's From The Mole Jug"" (with it's eerie beat), the eight-minute ""The New Decadence"", ""Crumbs Of Affection"" and the seventeen-minute epic ""Romanesque But-Tox"". Line-up: Treiops Treyfid - bass & vocals, Justin Chearno & Scott De Simon - guitars and Patrick Gough - drums & vocals. Might do something for fans of the Unwound, Faust and Gang Of Four."
3,verse-chorus-verse-rock-post-rock,"i bought pitchblende cuz alt.press said they sound a wee doncaballerish. lil did i know that doncabishness w/o the brilliance of damon che and ian t. williams (and with the presence of the very same chorus in every song) equals a sincere, 'nice try there, fellas'. the last track fades out on a really swell high-school-drama-sorta tip (a tad bit Home IX), but i just couldn't get into this when i have truman's water, turing machine, and storm&stress layin around. maybe 'kill atom smasher' is better. i have not given up on pitchblende."
1,Not Honest & Out of Date,"Much has changed at Best Friends since this book was written. First, all the old founders are gone, and have been replaced with unknowns, some that have been fired under odd circumstances. Second, Best Friends has NOT succeeded at No Kill at their sanctuary. They turn away animals brought to them, and they have been getting rid of dogs they were committed to care for in large numbers, and are downsizing. Donors aren't aware of this. Also, information surfaced (documented by business records) that the merchandise purchased from Best Friends like Tishirts, mugs, etc. goes to a private corporation that financially benefits the founders, not the sanctuary. Something strange is going on at Best Friends, and there has been a troubling involvement with breeders and breeder groups who don't have the animals' interests at heart. This book is completely outdated, as nearly everything about Best Friends has changed since its publication, and not for the better."
5,Inspiring Stories of Animal Rescue,"This is a fantastic book. Like other reviewers have noticed, it doesn't contain a lot of animal abuse stories. The ones that are included are included to show what caring individuals can do to save animals in a bad situation and provide them with a shelter, a sanctuary, a place to live the rest of their natural life where they are safe, cared for, and loved.I have to say, this is the most inspiring story I have ever found. It starts with a group of friends who want to save animals. They find a plot of land that inspires them where they move all of their current animals. Through financial troubles they work together to create the awesome animal sanctuary that exists today. It is truly inspiring and can make anyone want to do their part in lowering the kill rate of unwanted animals and valuing every animal - no matter their disability or care requirements."
1,not honest,they are not being honest about their ties to the Process Church which included in the beginning animal sacrifice. They just found a way to get money & hide behind the curtain of caring about animals. Just my opinion.
2,"Also Read ""Ultimate Evil"" by Maury Terry","I enjoyed this book and the history of this group. When compared to Maury Terry's book, ""Ultimate Evil"", you'll see the real true story of the world's most beloved animal sanctuary. According to public records in the state of Louisiana, Best Friends Animal Sanctuary originated as The Process Church of the Final Judgment. Incorporated in 1968, the name has changed several times throughout the years and this once apocolyptic/satanic cult is now a loving animal sanctuary. So leopards can change their spots! Their Articles of Incorporation show the same people still together after 35 years. Too bad this wasn't covered in this book."
2,Buyer Beware! The translator should be shot!,"This Volume is beautifully illustrated. Unfortunately that is the best that could be said for it. The translation is a travesty, as Mathieu's takes it upon himself to express some of his own ""artistic expressions"" by inserting outdated and anachronistic euphemisms from the 60's! Shame on him for being so self-serving and egotistical to take on this poetry as though it were his own. I would compare his actions to vandalism!"
2,Repackaged Powerboat Guide,I was very disappointed to find this book is a repackaged version of the Powerboat Guide. This was not apparent from the listing
4,Lorna Vallings,"The Lorna Vallings song taste was the best - by far - song on this soundtrack. I watched the movie and heard this song and wanted to hear the whole thing. I searched all over the internet, to find nothing. And no, that does not mean I typed her name into the AOL keyword box on my green imac. Hey so if anybody finds any more songs by her, post a reply. And hey, if Lorna happens by here, know that people want you to make more great music like this song."
3,Where is the rest of the music?,This was a great movie with a lot of exciting stuff. There were some songs that did not make it to the soundtrack which should have been included. There is one in particular during the scene when Luke brings Chloe flowers and they go to dinner etc. If anyone knows who sings it please e-mail me. I will be forever grateful. bcoleman@gabrielcom.net
3,an ok pic,I bought this a little bit after i saw the movie and i only really liked one or two songs in the movie but i loved the movie and after i bought the cd i realized there were alot more songs on it than i thought and it turned out alright so if you like everytype of music get this cd>
4,Somebody needs to discover Lorna Vallings!,"If you are a Melissa Ethridge fan, buy this CD just to hear ""Taste."" Reminiscent of early Melissa - but definitely not a clone. This woman's got a voice and a style all her own. Let's hope some label picks her up."
4,Skulls Soundtrack,"I really like this CD, it's very good, the music is haunting. I love the song ""Taste"" it's great, but I was a bit dissapointed because there are 2 songs missing, I don't know why. One is the song that plays when Luke steals the tape and the other is Creed's ""Higher"". I thought that song would be on the CD also which is why I bought it. There are 2 songs at the end of the CD I don't remember hearing and weren't that good, don't really know what the people who made this were thinking, but all in all it's a very good CD."
4,The soundtrack definetly matches the movie,"This soundtrack is mainly composed of background music and theme songs. The theme songs provide that spooky and secretive feeling that was simulated in the movie with the help of Randy Edelman and others. If you are looking for that sort of theme music, then this cd will be perfect. -Aside from the themes, there are a few songs at the end of the soundtrack by Lorna Vallings (""Taste"") and BTK (""Rigamarole"" - my personal favorite)."
4,OK So WHO is this Laura Vallings person?,"I saw the movie (twice) while I was studying in Canada... it's not out in the UK yet and ...loved it...I just loved the song Taste.. and sat through the credits to see who was singing it... and then ran off to the music store to pick one, two or more of her (Laura Vallings) CDs... to find NOTHING... So I bought this CD instead...Since then I've done internet searches etc etc... to no avail...Oh well... the CDs worth what I paid for it JUST for that song... If you've not heard it... you need to"
4,"Excellent Movie, and A Sountrack To Supplement","If you liked the Movie, you'll enjoy the pictures and memories of the movie this CD brings back. It is a SOUNDTRACK, so don't expect much more than the Backround music you saw in the movie, but if your looking for that, it's here and GOOD too. The last Four Songs are good as well, one of the main reasons I bought it, plus I enjoy the main Theme Music of the movie. A good buy if you want backround music and some new sounds in music."
4,The skulls,"I pretty much agree that this CD is a very good background music, and that the Song ""Taste"" is the best on it. I was trying to find out more about the singer ""Lorna Vallings"" but could not find her anywhere. Did anybody out there know about her? Does she have more Songs or CD's?"
2,fair,"Book could of gave more information like pace of play, drinking water, customer service, discount for seniors or ladies day information. Ratings of greens and fairways, Jr golf information,local hotel rates, etc,"
5,Great for all types of projects,I got these rods for building an antenna and they worked great. Easy to work with yet nice and rugged to last a long time
3,"boring writing, poor character development","I was initially excited by the premise of the book - man goes to sleep and wakes up in a different world, falls asleep in the different world and wakes up in the world where he started. The prologue began on a promising note, however, the rest of the book dragged and was boring. The characters were not interesting, and action sequences fell flat where they should have excited."
5,The best!!,"This may be one of my top 5 books of all time. The whole thing was engaging and outstanding. There was no lull anywhere. Each page and each chapter had interesting things happening. I've since read other's of Ted's including Red, White, Heaven's Wager, and Three. All awesome."
5,"""Black"" from a 13-year-old's perspective","This is propably the best book I've ever read! I saw a preview of the graphic novel for this book and I have to tell you, I was scared to read the book. But of course I did anyways. Boy, I'm I glad I did! I couldn't put it down! This book is absolutely astounding! It's amazing! Ted Dekker writes the best thrillers I've ever read. I'm only 13 but I think that this book could be for anybody of any age (teen and up). I enjoyed the rest of the series (though I must say the ""Green"" wasn't as good as I hoped:( ) but this one definatly is the best! You can read this book first or ""Green"" first but you should definatly start with this one (in my opinoin), starting with ""Green"" is to confusing. Every fantasy-lover should read this book! I've recommended it to all of my friends!"
4,Dekker's Black,"Once you start, you have to read the entire series. Challenging, thought provoking, action packed. If you let it, you will be stretched, mentally and spiritually."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I bought a copy of this book at the recommendation of my brother. Not even half way through it, I had to put it down. The writing is very simplistic and the novel appears to have been written for young teens. The concept of traveling between two realities through dreams is what attracted me to the material in the first place, but I just couldn't continue with the book. Unfortunately, I purchased Black, Red, and White at the same time so I have thrown my money away. (I need to have a talk with my brother!)I would say for young teens, this may be a fine book but if you are looking for adult reading, think twice before picking this one up."
5,"What Black has started, only White can end...or Ted Dekker","It has begun.Creator: Ted Dekker/Occupation: Master Mind WriterCreation: Black, Red, White/Occupation: Greatest Trilogy of thrillers to come in along in over a decade.Lucky One: Anybody who gets to read this work.If you enjoy a book that is a dull, boring, predictable,big waste of time and money, un-addictive, ugly let down--then do not read this book.If you are drooling for a work that is an amazing, breathtaking, unpredictable, well worth every second and penny, terribly addictive, mind boggling adventure--THEN READ THIS BOOK!Black is it! This is the book everyone has been waiting for.Combining the best of worlds akin to The Matrix, and those that echo The Lord of the Rings, Black-Red-White is the trilogy of the new millennium.Read it."
4,The Birth of Evil,"This is a fascinating story about the power of evil and the consequences of human choice. Centered around a central character whose dreams propel him back and forth between two realities, this is an exciting and suspenseful book with a powerful theological sub-plot. I greatly enjoyed it!"
5,A Must Read - Awesome Book,"I don't know that I can add much to what has already been said except to say, ""Thank you Ted."" Ted masterfully blends the art of storytelling in a fiction based book with the ability to make it seem real and compelling. Added to this is the fact that the book (and trilogy) really appears to be an analogy of what the world is really like. And how about that Black Bat? That thing is creepy. The evil bats ripping and destroying in the fight against good. This is exciting stuff. The only negative for me is that I can't wait for ""Red"" to come out. It was supposed to come out in April, then May, now I hear June - Ted you're killin' me!"
3,"Sci-fi, terrorist thriller, theology overlay, & more","While I generally like the book there are just too many plots to develop in the first half of the book. The book goes too slow for an action typed thriller.I applaud the author at the attempt of a very difficult theme of going from a science fiction to a thriller and back and forth. Then add a few miscellaneous thugs with a separate plot and story line about money. Then drop a Christian theme on top of it with obvious names associated to the Bible. Just too much taking away from the two main plot lines.With this in mind, I like the the two main plot lines. In one world evil is very literal and visible and in the other it is hidden(but equally as deadly) I am into the third book now so I have been intrigued enough to keep with it. I just didn't think literal evil would be a talking bat!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"I have never read a book that contained as much God-inspired content as this one. This entire book revolves around beccoming closer with God, and it is filled with so much symbolism that after three times reading it, I still don't think I got it all.Unlike traditional Christian novels, this series does not focus on church or angels. It is instead an allegory of a man forming a personal relationship with God.The fantasy elements of the book blend very well with the writing style of the author, which makes for an even better story. I give this book my highest reccomendation."
4,A Brilliant Spiritual Allegory,"I first picked up this fascinating trilogy as a curious Contemporary Fantasy set. Ted Dekker's plot was refreshingly original, with unexpected twists and intriguing suspense. I didn't realize until well into the first book (Black) that the story was spiritually allegorical. The absolutely brilliant way Dekker managed to weave three different biblical allegories into one gripping storyline was enthralling. He hooked me on the first page, and I couldn't stop reading until I finished the series. Bravo, Mr. Dekker!"
5,Awesome read!! makes you think...what if?,"sort of a cross b/w ""angels and demons"" and ""This present darkness"" need I say more? get this book, get all 3 of them!"
5,Oy with the Bats Already!,"When a friend told me about how this book included a giant talking evil bat...I must say, I laughed in his face. But I gave it a chance. And I was hooked immediately. Ted Dekker, you've done it again. Absolutely amazing storytelling. Even on my second perusal of the novel, I can't put it down. This guy has an incredible imagination. Twisted, yes, but undoubtedly incredible. It transitions from the real world, where good and evil seem to be relative terms, twisting and turning and without a true face to them, to the fantasy world where bad is bad and good is good because you come face to face with it. You won't be disappointed, even if one of the villains is a giant talking evil bat."
5,Blacker than Black,"A place where two worlds collide. Where knowing who you are is not a choice. In his first installment of the ""Circle Trilogy,""Ted Dekker introduces a new face in Christian fiction. The tale begins with a young man begin hunted down by the predators, only noticing that he was later shot. Recovering, he is transported into another realm, where he is known by everyone. The problem is, what is reality? Throughout the novel, Dekker slaps you hard from both sides, making you think you know what reality is, but only being slapped again when that possibility isn't true. Transform your mind from Black to Red."
2,predictable and religious,"it's a great idea (which dream is real) but if you're not into religious themes, stay away. my biggest complaint is that the main character, thomas, has no real redeeming qualities. he's actually kind of stupid. all in all not something i would recommend."
1,Ugh!,"Ted Dekkers 'black' is a pointless story. paper thin charecters and a protagonist who is dumber than a box of nails does not make for compelling reading. part conservitive political thriller, part narnia, part matrix all crap.i would recomend a deeper book than this on.like the stuff 5 year olds read."
5,Very well done.,I applaud Ted Decker in the first instalment of this series. I saw this book for the first time and i thought meh doesnt look great. Then i started reading it. It blew me away. It has the clear presence of God. But in an unoffending way so that almost anyone can read it. I found it full of action and suspense. Sicne reading this book i have gotten Ted Decker WHOLE collection. Simply marvelous.
4,Read it,"Black is a very interesting book with an interesting story, I don't think I've read anything quite like it. And that interesting story is a good thing, because I found I quite liked the story! It had thrills and suspense, the characters were great, and the ending just makes you want to read the next book in the series. A great book that I would recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Darn it. This should be labeled young adult (YA),"This book is not meant to be read by adults. Unfortunately, I am an adult. The book is written in a VERY simple style that I probably would have enjoyed if I was 12 years old. Be warned."
2,audiobook review,I'm sorry but the person who read this is horrible. I thought the book was okay but i think if I read it on my own I would have liked it better. I don't think I will read the rest of the series.
2,Talking bats and Attacking Flies,"It's always hit or miss with Ted Dekker novels. And, this one was definitely a miss. Seems like he was trying too hard for allegory. It was just lame. Fantasy mixed with real life. Talking bats and attacking flies. Couldn't get into it."
2,Confusing,"This book is PACKED with detail, and interesting ideas, but overall I felt like nothing was really explained--even just a bit. This is the first book in a series, but I still believe that some of the loose-ends should at least have some sort of answers to keep the reader engaged instead of frustrated and overwhelmed."
2,Not the story line i was expecting,"I love Ted Dekkers books and i have read a couple of them so i was quick to buy this series when i saw it, but I must saw I have struggled with reading this book. I love reading novels and usually devour them in a fw days but i am still to finish reading book one in this series. Quite disappointed, maybe because of the complicated storyline which has element of historical background."
3,BAD Narrator BUT WORTH the TIME,"The Narrator for Black is awful, never giving a breath between characters. It's so hard to know who is talking. There are few inflections and few voice changes for characters. He does get better as the book goes along, though. However, the writing is so good, that it is definitely worth the time to listen through it. The book itself starts out slow and plods along in some areas, but you'll never be able to get to ""Red"" if you don't get through this one. I just wish they would do the audio over with Recorded Books, instead of Oasis."
5,"""Black"" by Ted Dekker","I was overwhelmed with the ""readability"" and profround impact this book had on me. Its much more than a good work of fiction mixed with incredible intrigue and action, its truly a fresh taste of creative genius. I've enjoyed many books, but this book changed me. I now find myself thinking differently, and definitely considering my own dreams more carefully! Buy it now!"
2,Interesting plot,"I think this book has an amazing plot. I really do love the concept of falling asleep and waking up in another reality. The thing is, plot doesn't make a book. While the story he's telling is great, Ted Dekker's writing style is just terribly simplistic. One of his descriptions is something like "" it rumbled like the jet fuel underneath a rocket ship"". I've heard a couple times his writing is disappointing, but I didn't expect anything like this.If I was 11 and read this book I would have loved it. However, I'm a little older and know that just because a book has an interesting plot, doesn't mean it will be good.I suggest buying this book if you are under 14 or if you aren't picky about the quality of writing a book has to offer."
4,"Great book, on time","No actual wear, but paper aged a bit more than expected. I could care less myself, so I'm satisfied since it came on time and in otherwise good shape."
2,Big let down..never again.,"Very misled by the reviews on this book/series. I felt it was cheesy and at time found myself fast forwarding a bit as it got too boring. The only reason why i finished this book was because I had checked out the cd edition on the library and I played it out on my commute in my car. Well aware it had religious undertones, it just was too flaky for me, although for others it might have been perfect. I just could not get into it...found it boring and at times it dragged.I have read one other book from Dekker in teh past and I enjoyed it much, but given this book, I will not be reading anymore of the series.very dissappointed."
3,There's got to be something better than this,"This consists of two half hour shows in rough, un-remastered black and white, plus a public information film about not dropping litter. It is not a researched, 'best of' clip compilation as the blurb may suggest. Can't have been hard to out together. The show with Art Carney has its moments, with some genuinely funny moments of spontaneity, though I found Carney slightly over-competitive and annoying. It ends with a strangely sanctimonious, 'serious' speech from Winters about how much he loves spending time with his family. The Andy Williams show is in poor quality b/w video and is not terribly funny.There doesn't seem to be much of Winters available on dvd, which is a shame. I would recommend the wonderful Dean Martin Variety Show dvds (available elsewhere) which feature lots of Winters' very funny contributions in glorious colour."
1,would prefer zero star option,"As others have already said it was not funny. It is apparently a special from 1964, complete with the sponsors commercials. the commercials are the highlight of the hour. Jonathan says on more than one occasion that the audience members must be saying ""look at him, he's making a fool of himself."" I feel sure he was right. The cover has a disclaimer, saying that the dvd is neither endorsed nor authorized by Mr. Winters. That is for a very good reason. It is horrible."
3,"Rare, yes... riotous, maybe....","Maybe I just expected more out of it; it was ok, funny in most spots but not the most funny that I've seen of Jonathan. Maybe it's been too long since I've watched 'the master' that is Jonathan Winters...."
1,Distortion of John E. Holts Public Record,"The information in this book about John E. Holt, former GSA Official is false"
2,I didn't receive the correct brand.,I can't tell you how pentagon batteries are because I didn't receive pentagon batteries. The batteries I did receive we not packaged that well and some of the paint was peeling off a few of them a little.The batteries performed acceptably well.
4,Very good film but short on chills,I was hoping it'd be scarier. The only times I thought it scary was when Count Told saw images of himself chasing after him. Film gets better on repeat viewings and the commentary is good and informative.
3,I wanna give it a 5............,"This game is indeed a side story of Berserk and came to the US even before the anime. That's cool, and Berserk fans will love it.It has awesome cutscenes, fanservice, and it is pretty fun. But, the controls are clunky. The game is short,and rediculously easy. Still, its awesome that this game exists, so only buy it if you are a Berserk fan, and you can get a good deal."
5,Sensational!,I have to give this game two thumbs up. It's graphics and gameplay is unbelievable. It's the kind of a game i longed for. And i'm glad that sega provided us the chance to play an excellent game such as Berserk. All i can tell ya is to go out and get it. It's a purchase you won't be sorry for. So check it out now.
3,Oh so much carnage,"I really liked this game for the first month or so that I bought it. Nice graphics and easy controls, but I dont see too much replay value in this game. Yeah, there are different paths to take, but they just lead to the same thing, large amounts of death, but there's nothing wrong with that. If I had to recommend a game like Sword of the Berserk, I would probably have to say Draconus. It's a little more in depth, without losing the fun of slashing all kinds of enemies."
3,Not bad but DON'T run out and gett it,At first this game rockes but then you judt keep hacking at people and it gets agravating and boring so it ain't a bad game but it ain't a five star game
2,"Beautiful graphics, great story, but where's the game?","Booting this up the first thing that impressed me were the graphics. I was actually fooled into thinking the real-time into was a pre-rendered cut scene. The character design is really good, the story is interesting and has depth. The sound and effects are great. The only problem is that you spend 20% of the time playing the game and 80% watching the cut scenes, which you can skip but then have no idea what's going on in the story. The actual play scenes are fun, but do get a bit repetitive as they have the same 'hack everything to pieces' goal and your character doesn't seem to progress in any way (new weapons, skills, etc...) It's a lot more like a movie than a game, which is really unfortunate as it's obvious a lot of talented artists and programmers put a lot of hard work into it."
2,Boring,"There is nothing to do in this game its very redundant.Its only fun for 30 or so minutes...It is way too short also...But it is very detailed,like when you swipe your sword on the wall the sword will bounce back and make a spark and most games just have the sword go through the wall...The graphics are very good.The gameplay is ok,the guy swipes the sword fast as hell,the bosses are easy,or most of them are.I reccomend buying this game if you wont get tired of stuff and like a lot of bloodlust."
3,You'll spend more time watching CGI than playing,"This game is fun, but let's make something clear: this game has a LOT of FMV cut scenes. You will spend half the time playing by watching the plot develop.Don't get me wrong, the plot is well-conceived, but in my opinion, Eidos should have kept the flow of action higher. The actual gameplay is good, though it can get repetitive, but don't by this on hype alone. I would recommend it only for fans of the manga and diehard action-gore fans."
4,ONE OF THE BEST SWORDPLAY/ADVENTURE GAMES EVER!,"This game is hard but good. It has one of the best storylines ever(next to Max Payne). You have 2 differant weapons the sword(the best one) and these little flying daggers. The flying daggers can go long range(witch you won't need in this game)but the sword can kill better. DO NOT get this game if you have a fear of blood.This game has the most blood in a game I ever seen. The reason why I got this game is because it was only for $5.00, but it should be for $40. Get this game RIGHT NOW!"
2,"Cool, but way to quick!","I enjoyed this game, but I beat it in two days. And not much time was spent on either day. Maybe a couple of hours at most. The gore is pretty cool, but there just isn't a lot of depth to this game. And to be honest the story [stunk]. I think if the game was maybe two or three times longer it would be much cooler."
3,Sword Of the Beserk,"ok, don't get me wrong, but i like this game. there is a slightly good replay value, the music is great, the cut-scenes really show off the games excellent grpahics. but there are too many cut scenes. you only spend a quarter of the time playing the game, and the other 75% watching the cutscenes. i have actually played the whole game through. so anyone who gives this 5 stars hasn't played it all the way, or enough to get tired of it anyway. you do the same thing on every part of the game, hack and slash hack and slash. there is no strategy to this game, and the limit amount of weapons besides the sword really bites. i did beat the game in 2 days, with about 4 hours play, including watching all the cutscenes, so really you spend about an hour and a half playing it! . the game is too short! if you are the kinda gamer who likes a good and long game, don't buy this one, but definetaly rent it."
5,awesome!,"The speed and swirl of this music is mind-boggling. A nice change from some of the slower death/black/thrash metal we've been hearing, but it may be TOO upbeat for some, if you can believe that. Not for me, though--this is a fine, fine effort. I'd like to discover where the bank members wound up after COB broke up. Any ideas?"
5,One of the best metal albums ever.,"Hatebreeder is perfect. It was the first Bodom album I bought, and it remains my favorite. Every song has pounding riffs, incredible solos, and just rocks in general. Many people don't like Alexi's vocals, but even if you are one of those people, the music is still excellent. If you are a fan of metal and/or a guitar player, buy this album first."
5,2nd Best Bodom CD,"Where do i start about Bodom. Alexi is the greatest guitar player of his time and any album he is on it shows. Hatebreeder is classic Alexi. He writes hook laden songs that do not compromise speed, technicality, or overall aggressiveness. I do not honestly see how someone could say this band is untalented. What the hell are these people listening to? Granted CoB does not have mainstream appeal but there is no denying the talent. Anyways more about the album. This is the best drumming CD that CoB have. Every drum part flows and connects well from riff to riff. That's a statement considering CoB is know for guitars. And then the guitars, oh my god. Not as classical as Something Wild but just the right blend to keep everything fresh. I love this album and you should too. The best tracks are Silent Night Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Children of Bodom, and Black Widow."
2,"Just Like All Other COB Albums, This Band Just Doesn't Work","Sure, Children of Bodom are better than some other bands, but they just don't come close to most. The guitar is OK, the singing/growling sounds phony (listen to Possessed's album Seven Churches-thats true growling), and TOO MANY F***ING KEYBOARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The keyboards truly ruin this band completley, I'm sorry but something about this band just causes me strong dislike for them.Their blend of metal, growling, and keyboards/classical just makes it sound phony and taseless. Also they are NOT black metal, black metal is bands like Darkthrone, Mayhem, Immortal, Dark Funeral, and stuff like that."
2,Vocals Ruin It,"This band has got tons of talent.Soaring, ripping guitars with the best of them.Tight driving bass.Tight, crisp, FAST drumming.All that wouldn't mean anything, but unlike so many heavy bands these guys have melody.Melody, structure etc...Until:The Vocals.How friggin' annoying!Can we have enough of the death metal vocals please already?Anyone can do a Cookie Monster Impression."
3,Ok..I guess,"First off, I don't know who labled this band Black Metal, because I hear non of that in this. They fit into the MElo-Death category. They are kind of like In FLames, but rely on the keyboards instead of the guitars. The guitars are great, but the keyboards are nagging, and overshadow them. The timings of the songs are pretty good. But the worst part of all is the lyrics- ""Silent night, Bodom Night""? Pretty dumb. They could probably have better lyrics for being a band named after a couple of murdered kids."
2,my first and last CoB album,"More like 2 1/2 stars. I had high expectations for Children of Bodom after reading all the 5 star reviews, but this album is a letdown. Yeah, the musicianship is spectacular, technically speaking, with the guitar work being a real highlight and very good drumming too. But there's just no drive or power to the music, it's very thin and slicing instead of gut pounding. The keyboards are annoying and don't add any atmosphere. The singer's black metal vocals are incredible, I just wish he would stick to them instead of alternating with this embarassing half-ass would-be death growl that sounds more like a cartoon monster voice. There's also a lot less darkness than their image leads you to expect. Overall they seem more like a heavier version of Stratovarius than any death or black metal band. I'll pass on their other albums."
5,This album is HARD,"This was the first COB album I bought, and I now own all of them. That should say something right there. Hatebreeder is SICK. Alexi is by far one of my favorites. Amazing. You hear something new everytime you listen to it, and that's for at least the first 40 times. Insane. Towards Dead End is the best song in my opinion. Buy this CD!"
5,Amazing.,"I just recently heard of this band, and already they're one of my favorites. CoB are a great band, with more talent than most nu-metal bands can even dream. If you like melodic or death metal go buy this now. In fact, if you like metal at all, buy this now. Outstanding tracks are Warheart, Bed of Razors, and every other song on the CD."
5,The Best of 1999,"The best CD of 1999 (so far). Well-written music with excellent production, and some very talented musicians. Similar in style to At the Gates, Death, In Flames, etc... This is definently a new band to watch."
4,"Good, but will never live up to Follow The Reaper","Pretty good, some really awesome songs on it but i dont like some of the songs because some of the riffs are the same or very similar. The best songs on the cd are Warheart, Silent Night, Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Bed Of Razors, and Wrath Within. The other songs are alright just not as good as i thought they would be after listening to Follow The Reaper. Some people like this one better but im just telling it like it is!"
3,Juice unplugged,"Juice Newton has a great voice but this album hides it behind too much 60's overproduction. The strings and heavy guitars mask what was otherwise some great country/pop crossovers from a talented vocalist. If she had done all of them ""unplugged"" it would be a fantastic album. As it is, only ""Angel of the Morning"", ""Queen of Hearts"" and one or two others really give you what Juice really has to offer."
3,Unimpressed,"I guess Juice Newton really isn't my thing. I remembered her from the 80s on the radio with a few notable hits. They're here: Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me, It's a Heartache, Playing with the Queen of Hearts. But the rest of the album is better left in the 80s. It's a mix of pop/country with lite rock. The whole thing has kind of a lite FM feel. Maybe Juice was just more of a woman's singer. This album is O.K., but nothing I really look forward to hearing."
1,Great ....... dissappointment,"One should not believe everything one reads - especially not reviews because they are mostly written by fans I suppose. I made the mistake and believed :-)Except for the beautiful woman on the cover this CD is an empty barrel. If there would be elevator music with lyrics this is it. I place this in my own category named ""Las Vegas music"" - you can hear it but you don't listen. Even the arrangements are mediocre. One has heard these sounds a million times or more. Leaves no track, creates no feelings.I am sure Juice would be far better seen live. But without any previous experience nor knowledge I would not recommend this record to anybody. Except perhaps Otis. Sorry."
3,Remakes?,"These mixes are definitely Juice, but the tempo and arrangements seem off to me. Not what I remember from the raido."
4,It's all I've heard,"I bought this a long time ago mostly because I liked Queen of Hearts, one of my favorite songs, and I found most of the other songs to be enjoyable as well. I don't have any other Juice Newton albums but I've listened to this one a lot. Several very good songs, and she does a nice job with them."
5,Juice Newton-Greatest Hits,"Very Good CD well worth the price. She is a very good singer shereminds me of Janie Frickie. She sings country and pop and baledI really like this CD it has a bunch of here hits on it and somethat I have not heard before very nice.Sincerely, Jason or Peter Pielak."
4,Juice's Greatest,"I saw Juice Newton in concert way back when Angel of the Morning first came out and I was blown away by the purity of her voice. I remember it gave me goosebumps. So I was browsing through Amazon and came across this greatest hits cd and figured it was time to update the handful of vinyl albums I own. This cd has all her major hits and its great to hear that marvelous voice without all those pops and clicks of my old vinyl. And it may just be my old ears, but I swear the songs on this cd sound like re-recordings...not the originals. I could be wrong, but I've heard Heart of the Night hundreds of of times and on this cd, her voice sounds just a shade older. Even so, the songs still sound great and this is highly recommended."
2,Not much about actual seed starting here!,"I was looking for a seed-starting primer, like the title promised. Instead, I got probably one full chapter on seed starting, and eleven chapters on general gardening. I usually like what Rodale preaches -- I'm a dedicated composter myself. But if you title a book ""Seed-Starting Primer"" then I think it should be mostly about starting from seed.I'm very disappointed and am now looking for an actual seed starting book."
5,Valuable tips and methods,This reference almanac has to be compared to volumes of hard backs and its contents though compacted have been a wonderful and useful tool to my self. With limited space and the need for immediate reference this item is hard to beat.
2,"Could be better, could be worse (leaning towards worse)","I had a chemical spill in my bathroom & ended up tossing my usual Ion bleach to be on the safe side. Instead of replacing the big bottle of developer & bucket of powder, I got the Manic Panic flash lightening kit. I was too nervous to leave it on for longer than 45 minutes but that took me close to pale blonde. It also left my scalp itchy and dry for days. My hair appreciated it even less than my scalp did. My hair is still in a fairly fragile way (even though it's been over a week since), I have to be so careful of breakage. Is it worse than the average brand of bleach? Probably not but I'm still going back to Ion sensitive scalp developer 30v which doesn't hurt my scalp as much and was easier for my hair to recover from."
3,Great Lightener - Not A Lot of Product,"I was attempting to bleach my whole head, and this was not enough to do the trick, sadly. I had to go out and buy another box. But it bleached my hair very well, the bit there was in there."
1,If you like pain here you go,"Manic Panic is the worst dye I've ever come across, but the bleach is the worst there's no way to not hit your scalp if you want good results, however you will receive a free skin peel on your scalp. Please do not use it is unsafe, try punky color or hot topic."
4,Functions well and protects iPod case,"I am very happy with this product on the whole. It has protected my iPOD well for over a year. The reason I am giving it four stars is that the ""removable"" belt clip was removable initially but then I screwed it in tight once and I have not been able to remove it. The belt clip works great and the hold button is accesible without opening the case and I am satisfied with this product."
3,This is a fine keyboard,"I've been using the COMPAQ branded version of this keyboard. The software for the buttons on top is decent. Not a memeory hog and unlike some of the logitech keyboards includes no spyware. I find the nipples on the 'f' and 'j' keys to be a little small, so touch typers beware. Like just about every modern keyboard the caps-lock key is much too large and very annoying. Stood up to a year and a half of heavy use at work. It may be filthy, but still works great."
2,DON'T BUY THIS GAME,"I bought ""ECW Hardcore Revolution"" back in December hoping that it would live up to all of its hype. I thought that it would be as cool as the actual ECW wrestling. Geez, was I wrong! This game is basically like ""WWF Attitude"" (Which was also horrible) but with ECW wrestlers. The moves are the same, the entrances are the same, and the weopons are th same. This is so boring!"
3,Attitude!,This game is good if you are an average person who basical enjoys wrestling. Those of you who are big wrestling fans will be hugely dissapointed. I think that this game is okay but it is exactly like the game wwf attitude. I think it is a good game for dreamcast but i am still going to wait for a THQ game to come out for the dreamcast.
1,Cheap rip-off of WWF Attitude,"This game blows. The graphics engine, control scheme and motion-captured moves are EXACTLY the same as they were on Attitude. It's disturbing to see spike dudley break out the Stone Cold Stunner for no reason in a match. Want to see Tommy Dreamer go for the Rock Bottom? Or maybe you want to see the entire roster come out to a cheesy generic entrance theme? This is an embarrasment. Oh, and about the ""barbed wire"" matches, all you do is thow someone into the ropes and they bleed the same as they did in attitude. ::Yawn::"
4,Good quick read,"Realizing that Glen Campbell is now performing his ""Goodbye Tour"" , I quickly bought tickets to one of his upcoming shows. Reading this bio in advance was well-worth it. I knew he had some problems in his life but not of the magnitude revealed in the book. Wow, and a rocky drug-fueled affair with Tanya Tucker which caught me by surprise. A very straightforward, no punches pulled book. Now that Glen is struggling with Alzheimer's Disease, I wish him and his family well. He was, and still is, a gifted performer. My only negative comment is that the chronology of the book has a tendency to bounce back and forth."
3,The intellectual pianism!,"For some reason the cold expressiveness of Maurizio Pollini has been object of veneration for man people, but not in my case. If the coldness is a virtue, you may find out inside the pianism of Emil Gilels, for instance but I must confess he had that accurate touch, sense of span and an entire disposition of anima around every single piece he performed.In the particular case of Pollini I have intended to approach myself through several composers; Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven and the result has been the same; his performances are flat, hyper dry temperament, and lack of lyric life."
5,"Excellent, practical guide for forensic practitioners","This is simply the best book available on disputed confessions and the psychology of interrogations. The author provides a thorough but readable overview of models of interrogations and false confessions, as well as a practical guide to performing assessments in this growing area of forensic practice."
3,"A good intro to ""digital divide"" issues.","This book is somewhat dry, but does present alot of information and data concerning the digital divide in countries all over the world. For those unfamiliar with what the digital divide is, it is the lack of ""information and communication technology"" in developing countries and in underprivedged sections of developed countries.Warschauer does a good job of presenting the problems and probable causes. He then presents many different types of solutions that have been attempted, their successes and failures, and why they either worked or not. He finally discusses why we should now view this problem as a digital inequality instead of a digital divide.If you are unfamiliar with this topic, I believe this would be a good breadth-type introduction."
5,arthur,"There isnt much more for me to say about this i havent already said about the TV show Arthur. I absolutely love it. Unlike some children's shows Arthur encourages children to learn, think, and explore the world - as well as teach understanding of our differences - and to sympathise with each other because as most adults know life isn't always easy, even when we're very young."
5,Arthur growing up,This product was in a good condition and am loving it. It is a good buy and your kids will enjoy it.Arthur (1981)
3,could have been better?,"My biggest problem with Rodney Castleden's ""Mycenaens"" is that the book is poorly illustrated. Too many times he's talking about a topic, when a photograph or well-designed map would have helped, tremendously. There were some sections that were interesting, but also other sections that were dry.Part of the problem may be that not a whole lot is truly known about these people. Apparently, even thought they were literate in what we now call Linear B, which we can read, they only wrote to document inventories, etc, and not to record literature or narratives."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was great and could have made for a great book, but the language was profane, inappropriate, and made me very uncomfortable. An 11-year old girl in Utah in the late 1800's would never use that kind of language even when trying to shock her family! It was a very inaccurate portrayal of the time period. The author ruined what could have been a good novel. Definetely NOT a great book for teens!"
2,Boring read,"This book reiterates everything that a social worker or therapist already knows. Very in-detail, even to the point of hypothetical conversations. Yawn."
3,"Lives up to ""Made in China""","Very adjustable. Looks nice for most part -- except for some scratches and black marks on the arms. One metal hook connecting a spring was bent (easily fixed) and the electrical cord is installed with much too much exposed between the arms and at the lamp head. The base is solid and weighty, but the pin jiggles in the mounting hole. Rotating on/off clicker is rather cheep. The light is dimmer than I expected - 50W bulb - Many have 75-100W. The light is focused somewhat narrowly, making this better for spot lighting than lighting a whole desk area. After being on for a total of 30-40 min, heard a pop sound: two very small chips of glass, apparently from the edge of the glass shield, came out of the head; no apparent damage. I guess it might be worth $20. I think this is going back."
1,Not a bright purchase!,"The lamp has a stylish and clean brushed steel appearance while managing to throw a decent amount of light. Which is particularly good for reading and typing at the computer.However be forewarned, once the bulb goes you are in for a ride. After several visits to different hardware stores over a period of months I still cannot find the bulb. I searched and found a review which said it was JCD 120V 50watts T3 G9 but the truth has yet to be seen.The base is also flimsy and each time I pick it up I feel as though it may fall off and come crashing through my glass desktop surface.Seriously, the price is good but stay away and stick with a more mainstream lighting manufacturer. Very Disappointed Grandwich(wherever you are located).Grandrich FD100ST One-Light Halogen Swingarm Light, Steel"
2,Impossible to find the right bulb!,"WARNING: the specs say 120v 50w halogen bulb. I bought a standard GE halogen bulb that matched this description at $6.50, but, it's too small. The pins are too close together on the blub. I have no idea where to get replacement bulbs and the ones that came with the lamp only lasted about 6 months each! I love the lamp otherwise, but its not worth the hassle."
5,Awesome lamp!,Love this lamp! I would certainly love getting a couple more of these. Bulb last long.
3,Swingarm Steel Table Light,Like the light and as advertised. Fast shipping. Do not like the cut off switch on the cord. Would have been much better mounted in the base. Light gets very hot however I guess most of them do.
4,I expected more,"This is a better than average CD, butfrom a movie that actually preaches the rules on how to make a good mix tape, I'm a bit surprised.Great are the selctions from Velvet Underground (extra points for using the early stuff), Kinks, Thirteenth Floor Elevators, OF COURSE Stevie Wonder, Beta Band, and perhaps an undiscovered gem from Bob Dylan (off a little known album from the 80's).However, why B+ bands like John Wesley Harding, Smog, and Royal Trux were included is totally beyond me. I agree with the editorial revue-- more soul needed. How about Al Green?"
3,Misleading!,"An album and film entitled ""High Fidelity"" without Elvis Costello's song of the same name? The wonderful novel it's based on takes place in London, and is infused with the sensibility of that time and place. This album track listing doesn't make me want to run out and see the film, opening this Friday. The previews for it feature ""Town Called Malice"" by the Jam, which as you can see doesn't make the soundtrack, either. A very disappointing collection!"
2,Faithful to the book?,"I looked forward to seeing the songlist for the soundtrack as soon as I heard the movie was coming out. V. disappointed. First you need High Fidelity from Elvis Costello, which lends sensibility to the whole story. Then where's Solomon Burke? The selection of soul is sparse, considering Rob (the main character)'s love Otis Redding and old Stax. Puzzling."
3,Great...but incomplete,"Ok, the music on this CD is all good, and worthy of being included, but they need to release a second CD, and a third, and probably a fourth. There are tons of great songs in the movie I would love to have heard on this CD. The movie doesn't have the strong attachment to Soul that the book does, instead there's a mix of old and new pop--mainstream and obscure. Which works, but if you're expecting a soundtrack for the book you're going to be disappointed. Plus, I would have thought that if they were going to go the pop route all of the music would have been a little edgier then it is. Even so, this is a pretty good CD, but I guess that I'll end up playing the Grosse Pointe Blanke CDs much more often then this one"
3,Left Wanting More,"The soundtrack is good but I was disappointed because I was expecting more. It could have been a GREAT soundtrack. It seems like some of the most important songs from the movie have been left off. When I listen to a soundtrack, in a way, I want to be able to follow the movie musically and this just doesn't get all of the right points in the story. It would be great if this were the first of two discs. Also, the soundtrack doesn't even follow the rules for a good mixed tape."
4,This soundtrack is great.,"With so many quality songs on the album, I barely could pick which songs I wanted. What I really wanted to know is why they didn't include The Roots song ""Pass the Popcorn"" on the soundtrack. The Roots are one of the best groups out and Pass the Popcorn is a classic track, since it was in the movie it definitely should have been on the soundtrack. All the other tracks on the sountrack are ill though, definitely one of my favorite movie sdtks to pop in the deck. Definitely pick this one up"
4,What are your top five favorite records?,"If ""High Fidelity"" didn't have a decent soundtrack, then it would be like the package was only half complete. A movie that is mostly about the music and how it reflects our lives better have a good soundtrack. Thankfully, this movie does. It incorporates the best of the new with the best of the old, and there are some surprisingly fabulous tracks. The making of this soundtrack is like that of a great compilation tape, just like John Cusack said: ""First you have to start it off with a kicker to grab attention, then you have to take it up a notch, but you don't wanna blow your wad, so then you've gotta take it down a notch. There are a lot of rules."" The makers of this soundtrack knew the rules, and they followed them well. This is the kind of CD you can groove to anytime. Favorite tracks: Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Stevie Wonder, Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan (of course), and the most surprisingly good track on the CD, Sheila Nicholls' ""Fallen for You."""
3,Easy Listening for Generation X,"This is music that is as off-beat as the screenplay, which makes it the perfect soundtrack. As an album, the music is very unassuming, something you could have on in the background on continuous play and never really notice it. This is music that exists as a background to the moodiness and isolation of the film, much like an audio matte painting. If the movie really clicked with you, this will be a staple to your music collection, assuming you don't already own everything on it. I personally found it nice yet dull at the same time."
2,"Anything with the V.U. gets automatic points, but...","If you are going to make a movie about/for music fanatics and obsessive music critics, you better put more thought into the soundtrack."
4,"Good soundtrack, but not Great","I keep this CD handy at work because it has a good variety of songs; the only drawback is that I wish it had more songs that were played in the film - I know Cusack probably didn't have the clearance for every single song, but I think there was enought for at least a 2CD set, which would have been better (in my opinion). Nonetheless, I'd still buy this one."
5,Every song is good,This is the cd I want to play when I'm home alone and can turn it up and clean like crazy. I can't get any luckier than to have a mixed variety of artists and love each song on the CD.Very good taste and fun to listen to.
4,great soundtrack,"I don't know if this soundtrack is supposed to be arranged chronologicly, alphabeticly or autobiographically, but it is a great piece of music to listen to. The only song they should have left out is the one the two skateboard rockers sang in the movie. Otherwise excellent."
3,Where's Lisa?,"O.K., great movie. Especially for those of us who've actuallly been there. Soundtrack should have been a double album. Most grevious error... Where's Lisa Bonet? She sang a featured song. It could have been Happy Birthday or 100 Bottles of Beer... featured songs by beautiful women go on the Soundtrack. Haven't those guys ever made one of these before? I'm not buying, now, for this reason."
3,Good...but stuff is missing.,I thoroughly dug the movie but a lot of the songs that I liked aren't on this disc. What's the deal?
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"One of the best movie soundtracks ever - other top contenders are Orange County (the movie, not the show), Pirate Radio, and Love Actually. If you haven't seen the movie, watch it - anything based off of Nick Hornby's books is utterly amazing."
5,"Honestly, bought this for just one song...","But I found many others that were really good. Soundtrack from the movie, Jack Black's version of ""Let's Get It On"" can only be found here and as of my purchase, cannot be bought seperately from the CD. I LOVE that song, so here we are. Also found other very nice songs, like Stevie Wonder's ""I Believe."" Great compilation!"
2,Correction,"I just have a correction for the user that made a complete list of all the songs in the movie. I think the name was ""A Music Fan"" but I'm not sure. ""Walkin' On Sunshine"" was sung by Katrina and the Waves, not K.C. and the Sunshine Band. For those of you not sure, that is the first song on Jack Black's character's monday morning tape. Plus, I just want to say that Bonet's pathetic singing making it on the record and not Katrina and the Waves is just sad."
1,not yet recieved,i have not yet recieved my purchase and am very unhappy as it was a christmas gift to someone.
3,shostakovich film music volume 3,This is the 3rd of a series of 5 volumes devoted to film music of Shostakovich. This is early film music worth listening to. The performance is not all polished but the good news it is very expressive. Listen to the xylaphone in the Counterplan and to the flute or is it a piccolo in the Sofya Perovskaya work. The soloist seem to be enjoying themselves. These are not recent recordings but the sound is acceptable. and the playing more than conpetent. I Look forward to more film music in this series.
2,baby Ben clock,Has a flaw in design that i've never seen in a baby ben. the winder interferes with the other knobs and it is very difficult to use.
4,Big Ben 1965 Baby Ben Classic,"Baby Ben is a good size and the numbers are easy to read. This clock is valuable when the power goes off in the winter. The winding key is close to another ""knob"" making it more difficult to wind than is necessary."
3,What you see is what you get!,"This album is a trawl through some good parts of Delbert McClinton's back catalogue, and it's a shame this isn't always as clearly indicated as it might be. The choice of material is good, being a representative selection of the kind of roadhouse R&B/rock'n'roll (delete according to your own personal preferences or prejudices) that the artist does so well. Longtime D.M. fans who only have this stuff on vinyl may welcome its release on CD, and anyone who doesn't yet know the guy, but is into solid, meaty, ""more than just guitars"" R&B, ought to be pretty satisfied. For me a standout track is his version of the old classic ""Before you accuse me""; but there isn't really a weak song on the album. Perhaps not up to the very high standards of his last album, ""One of the fortunate few"", but still, any Delbert McClinton issue is like meeting up again with a real old friend, and as such must be good news ... as we wait for the next really new stuff!"
3,Fun collection of a master doing r&b covers.,"If one were to recommend one Delbert McClinton CD, this is not the one. It is a fun collection of 50s & 60s r&b covers taken from his 70s albums on ABC and Capricorn. Delbert can make almost anything work and does here. A fun play at a party or in the car on a long drive."
1,Squeaks loudly after 2 years and 3 months of use,"My wife and I bought this glider and ottoman in May 2009. After about 2 years and 3 months of use, they both began squeaking loudly. The bearings are shot. I called Storkcraft to get new bearings. They said that since it's over a year old, it's no longer under warranty. I replied, that's fine, can I order some new bearings? They said they don't sell just the bearings, only the base which was about $60 shipped each. I feel this is unacceptable. The chair and ottoman lasted slightly over 2 years and it's going to cost over $60 each to replace them. I do not intend on buying anything Storkcraft again."
2,Developers played this too much,"The other reviewers are right. Let's make the new releases a little less difficult. The game is a blast but it's almost impossible to unlock the rest of the tracks. The extra boosts should be there to help you out, not a necessary item to win."
2,cool game,"This game is for the hardcore extreme gamers. Unfortunently I am not one of them. This game is an arcade based with time limits, you also pretty much get first every time in order to move on. I dont know maybe some people like time limits but all my friends know, I DONT. Once I got bored with my other games I began to play it. I would of rated it better anyway if it wasent for one thing. It is very buggy. I would play and just about every race It seemed like the ground just dissappered to leave my truck/buggy to fall of the world to its doom. It some times freezes up in the begining where it says 3-2-1 and no GO."
3,Medicus,It does help you have a more disciplined approach to your swing but its not going to replace taking a video lesson with a golf coach and lots of hours on the practice range
1,what is lower than 1 star?,I purchases a Medicus Driver and 7 iron a few months back. Recently I hit a ball (at about 50%) on the range with my 7 iron and the head snapped off and flew out on to the range. After contacting Medicus twice via email with no response I was beginning to see that I might be in trouble. I contaced Mecdicus by phone today and they told me I was completely out of luck. This company DOES NOT stand by their products. Buyer Beware!!
3,Okay product,"I think the concept is good for this club but, it almost make me slice the ball or turn the club over too much. I've been playing the game for about 14yrs and this club may be great for a beginner golfer (in my opinion)."
2,Greatest Hits - Rehashed,"Yes it's well produced, but these are NOT the performances you remember hearing pour out of the dash board of your car in the 60's. I'd have MUCH preferred if they had gone back to the originals masters, if they're available, and cleaned them up digitally if needed.Be advised ; ALWAYS listen to several samples before you download; I didn't and I regret it. A MAJOR dissapointment."
1,Do listen to the quality of the tracks,"Sorry, but this collection isn't all that well produced. ""Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying"" starts as a fade-up 4 or 5 seconds into the song, so you lose the beginning of it! ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" sounds like it was sampled at 64kbps. I got this via iTunes after hearing the samples on my iPod and after transferring the tracks to my pc, I discovered how poor some of these really are. Stick with the EMI versions if you want good production."
3,read a mat place mat,Edges of mat seem to curl up a bit and not everything washes off (pen marks) but my little girls likes to try to do all the ballet positions!
5,This flashlight is a cut above!,"This light is a step above any light I have ever owned. This is my second one for use in an out building. When I bought the first one I was skeptical given the price, but I was quickly impressed with the quality and performance. I will never buy anything else, but I may never have to!"
1,Down there,"I have not receive it, not even were they able to provide me with a tracking #, if I do not receive it by next week I will cancel theorder."
1,Nonsense approaches,The ideas and methods in this book are lame. There are better sources out there. Beginners move on! This book has good intentions and I am sure thrilled some but from a real perspective it teaches nothing. My copy will go back.
5,God I love FELLATIO,"Not only was the author right but my wife of 50 years can now give awesome fellatio we only started it 2 years ago and she ""sucked"" but not literally now that she 71 years old she is a pro she gave fellatio to me once while i was making doodie and it was spectacular!!!! :) I want to thank the author she know also does bukkake and various things without my advice. Thanks again fellatio is the only way to go (SOuth)"
1,give me a break,"I love sex guides but I wish that this search would not constantly bombard me with material such as this.I am sending this book back. Shame on the author, publishers and Amazon for carrying this kind of material. -*"
4,Well Written,"If you are new at this or have done it many times, this book is for you. Ms. Blue tells it as it is, very straight forward and she doesn't ""pretty up"" her wording. You have to be open and honest with yourself and what you want to do. There are a whole lot of ideas in this book to try out. Would make a great gift for anyone who has ever thought about preforming fellatio, even for men. She has written this for both woman/man and man/man. If you have ever thought about it, she probably has a way to do it in this book.Good luck!!!"
3,Informative but dry,"The book is packed with information, and the author quite clearly knows what she is talking about. However, I didn't enjoy the writing style and had to force myself to finish the book. And yes, there are illustrations, but they are few and not all together helpful."
1,the ultimate guide to fellatio,"The Ultimate Guide to Fellatio: How to Go Down on a Man and Give Him Mind-Blowing Pleasure (Ultimate Guides Series)this book is a waste of money. it is all common sense information. the title is deceiving because it gives no information on techniques. don't buy this book, you will be wasting your money."
1,Ugh! Could it have been any more boring than this?,"This book is a truly difficult read. You really have to force yourself to turn the pages. It has some useful information but is extremely boring and mechanical. I read both this book and ""Going Down guide to Oral Sex"" and found the latter to be so much easier and more fun to read. I recommend you try that one first, or search for another book on the subject."
5,buy this book,I loved this book. It teaches everything you need to know about fellatio but your girlfriends were always to shy to relate - if they even knew! Want to please that special someone and have a great time being confident in your skill? Buy this book.
4,Promises to be an interesting read...,"I'm about fifty pages in to this... I found it boring at first, but it seems to be getting more interesting. It is very informative and surprisingly long. My only disappointment is that the pictures are drawings (and not very good ones). Considering who it's written by, you would think that there would be some stock pictures that could be included... That would have been a lot better.Incidentally, my husband is very excited by some of the new techniques that I have learned already."
2,Not what I expected...,"I purchased this hoping to learn some new techniques that would surprise my husband in the bedroom. Unfortunately, the book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know about fellatio. I did learn more about the physiology behind male arousal and orgasm and I found that chapter of the book very interesting. Overall though, this book would probably be best for a person just becoming sexually active or someone very sexually inhibited - not someone who already enjoys going down on their man and feels confident doing it."
5,Nuclear fusion pleasure ....,"Who would have thought that a book that describes a sensitive subject in frank, and very descriptive terms would pull you astronomically closer to someone you love. My wife has barely begun practicing the various methods detailed in the book. Fellatio was always been good, but now fellatio has taken on a whole new nuclear aspect in our relationship. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
1,disappointing,"This is certainly not a ""guide,"" as the title suggests. It talks a great deal about and around the issue, but offers little in terms of technique. I guess if you're not sure you even want to do it, this book might be helpful in making you more comfortable with the idea. But if you are actually looking for some specific advice that will give him ""mind-blowing pleasure"" as the book title infers, you won't find it here."
3,Hmmmmm,I thought for sure that this would have been a mind blowing experience and that I would gain new information. However this book does not offer anything you couldn't read in Cosmo. Save your money and buy a back issue of Cosmo....you and your man will both enjoy it much better. Or better yet get a book by Lou Paget.
3,boring,"There were a lot of (needed anyways) issues covered dealing with safety concerns and personal attitudes for the first 6 chapters, then little techniques afterwards (nothing we didnt know before), meshed in with more concerns. I wouldn't say its mind-blowing, but one could get some good information from it anyway."
3,Pleased,"It was an intersting read. Some of the info was new to me. It was kinda fun just to have the book around. It was sexy and naughty all in itself. Seeing the book on the bed or dresser, etc can be. . . .inspirational."
4,I love this book!,"Although, I thought our sex life was great before.... after reading this book together, my wife and I are experiencing, just as the title says ""mind-blowing pleasure"".The techniques presented in this book work perfectly. The male anatomy lessons, and the information on erectile disfunction have changed our lives. We both feel like teenagers again."
1,Not the origional,"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGIONAL BOOK, BUT A POOR BLACK AND WHITH REPRODUCTION. IT IS A GREAT DISAPOINTMENT. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY FOR THE PHOTO REPRODUCTIONS. VERY POOR. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Book Condition,"The binding was somewhat broken when I got it and it didn't take long for it to fall apart into 2 pieces. By the end of the semester it was in 3 pieces and I had to use a rubber band to keep it together. So I think the book's condition wasn't rated quite right however, it was one of the lowest priced books at the time I bought it."
3,Acceptable for the price.,"The book was not in ""Good Condition"" as advertised. The cover and spine were torn and taped back together, almost all of the pages of the anthology had moderate amounts of writing and highlighting on them, and some of the pages in the book were almost torn completely out. That being said, shipping was much faster than I had anticipated, it came UPS, not USPS like seller specified, and arrived in less than a week. Also, the book was so cheap ($7 for an anthology that originally costed $65+) that the quality of it did not matter, as I will just donate it after the class I am using it for."
3,English Lit.,I think that this product had a little more highlighting and damage done to it than described. But the damage might of been done in shipping and handling. Other than that it was usable.
5,Norton Anthology,The Norton Anthology is a fine addition to anyone who needs a perspective on English literature. I purchased a soft cover Eighth Edition (used) at a great price. It has everything the a general reader and lover of English lit could want and more.
1,I couldn't even find the interest to finish this book.,"This book jumps around from scene to scene and thought to thought so often that I couldn't find any feeling for the characters. It seems as though the author is trying to write a deep, thought provoking story, but instead this book is depressing and incredibly boring.It takes forever until it even starts to make sense and by then I had completely lost interest. Is the book about dogs, the relationship between the kids and their uncle, or the weird history between the man and the woman. I have read Harlequin Superromances for years and usually I can get through even the most dull, but this is one author I won't read again."
5,hero,"a true hero gritz isfor trying to find pow/mias despite the american governmentstopping him and threatening him at every turn, he served with honor and dignity and shame on anyone attacking him, why dont they help rescue the abandoned men the governmnet left behind."
1,The Bo-Bo Show.,"I fully agree with this reader's ""Credibility lacking."" Anyone gifted with in the field of military intelligence would certianly not go out and announce to the world wide news media that they were going on a secret mission to SEA (South East Asia) to rescue POWs and MIAs. When I saw this on TV, years ago, I almost cried because it destroyed what our government was trying to do to get the POWs or MIAs back. Not all governements are perfect but the USA is the best. How easy it is for some like this showman Gritz to put down our country in so many people's mind. I suggest reading Susan Katz Keating's book ""PRISONERS OF HOPE"" to fully understand the tricks James Bo Gritz used to dash any hopes of ever retreiving any POWs and MIAs from SEA. A man that served with this fella in RVN 1967."
1,OLD TEXT WITH MANY ERRORS,This book contains may errors in the equations presented. Many of the answers in back of the book are incorrect. Problems lack needed illustrations. No solutions manual is available. Many formulas presented require specific systems of units.
3,Three movies with 3 different region codes!,"The good: Great price for these three excellent movies and the transfers for all three movies are very good to excellent and look great on my new 65"" Panasonic VT50 plasma TV.The bad: Each one of these movies is a different bluray region code. Yes that is right, I got three movies with each being a different region code A, B, and C. Lucky for me I bought DVD player where I could reset the region code using the remote so I was able to watch all the movies but if you have a standard U.S. bluray player, which is region code A only, you will not be able to play two of the movies in the value pack.4 stars for the transfer quality of the movies but 1 star for them being three different region codes so I give it an average of 3 stars"
2,bonus cds not included,"I like that I got all 3 great films in one set, however, there are no bonus cds with the set, even though the original disk has content to be used with the bonus discs. It didnt make much sense to me. I think i wil be getting them separately in the future, just for the bonus content. There was a lot of bonus content included with the first disc so either get rid of the bonus content altogether in the set or include the second disc."
3,Braveheart/Gladiator/Saving Pirivate Ryan (Blu-ray),"This sapphire collection is a good buy if you do not own any dvd disc of these 3 movies. Otherwise, you can skip this collection. The AV Quality of these 3 blue ray discs is not much distintive improvement over dvd disc, if you watch them on screen small than 100 inches in diagonal. I had compared them on an 120 inches diagonal front projection screen."
4,A great value,"Three good movies at a great price. Caution, though, these disks refer to a ""Disc 2"" that is not in the set. Not a problem for me as I bought them to watch the movies and don't sit around watching the ""aren't we so great for making such a great movie"" self-accolades on Disc 2's. But just so you know."
5,Sweet Collection,"This Collection of movies is a perfect gift for any man. Great Picture quality, amazing movies, and great price (black Friday)."
4,nice,It's a little smaller than I expected but it's cute. No hardware comes with it but 2 simple screws easily do the job.Overall I like and and am happy. Good value
5,Classic Brubeck,"This 4-cd collection was superb. Every track encompassed Brubeck's style beautifully, as they were selected by Brubeck himself. I loved the incorporations of international music as well, with influences from Japan, Turkey, and several other countries. Of course, great classics like the 5/4 time ""Take Five"" and ""Blue Rondo A La Turk"" were included. Also, Brubeck's commentary in the booklet after each song is extermely fascinating, providing a rare glimpse into how musicians create their work. Lastly, the biography at the end was filled with funny anecdotes, and an interesting perspective on Brubeck's life. Great photos, too. I would strongly recommend this collection to someone starting out with jazz;it is a timeless compelation."
5,Great career overview,"This borrows quite a bit from Dave's biggest album: ""Take Five."" Still, the whole package goes down very smoothly. You'll be able to listen to this in its entirety, which is a rarity for any musician whose careers usually include some sub-par music. Bruneck was so prolific, however, that this barely scratches the surface. His huge catalogue is still mostly in print, so rediscovering him is easy. One of the best. This package is prime."
2,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"I admit it, this is a good collection of Brubeck's works through the years, but it is not worth it. Just buy every album seperately. You'll be better off that way. This album is just a scam so someone can make a few bucks off it!!"
4,"A great, great Fourth, but a 53 min disc? It's a bit short.","I bought this reading with great scepticism but my opinion is that it's always good to hear something fresh. I am very happy that I bought it after all. Boulez is not my favourite Mahler interpretor but in this one he is more than good - he is great. The Fourth is surely not the most problematic of all Mahler Symphonies but is very common that conductors see it as a ""Mahler"" symphony (with whatever this may carry with it...) and trying to make it something it's not. Boulez reading is well paced and the playing is marvellous ( The Cleveland Orchestra has given us what I consider the best Fourth - Szell's Fourth). Juliane Banse's voice is good but can't match the greatness of this reading. I suppose that DG could give us something more (53 min is a bit short). That's the reason I do not give the fifth star."
4,"Not sure about world's best, but definitely ""Mass Market's Best Cat Litter""","I've had my kitty for 16 years and I've tried a lot of different litters. Either I was scooping into a ""sealed"" trash can so I wasn't hauling scoopings to the dumpster multiple times per day or hauling scoopings to the dumpster multiple times per day. Either I lived with the scent or I made multiple trips- lose/lose. I love that this litter is flushable-helps me to stay on top of scooping and keep the litter box clean for my finicky cat; and I don't have to live with odors- win/win! The fact that is is 100% natural appeals to my slightly more ""green"" side so I like that too."
4,Excellent kitty litter!,"""World's Best"" may be a hyperbole, but it's certainly the best of all the litter products I've tried (Swheat Scoop, Feline Pine, Fresh Step, Tidy Cats). My senior kitty took to it right away.Pros: Does a great job of clumping and fighting smells. Lasts a decent amount of time.Cons: Gets smellier when it's humid. Also, dusty paw prints!Overall, it's a great buy!"
2,Does NOT block odor and gets tracked everywhere!,"A co-worker raved over this product and after just getting our Buddy from the ASPCA we thought we'd give it a try. Like many other reviewers have commented, this stuff stinks right out of the bag. It also did not block odor at all. The litter also gets tracked throughout the house. It went everywhere. I had to sweep every time he used the box. Perhaps it works for some cats, but not for ours. I, too was very glad that they offered the free bag rebate. Advice is to not buy too large of a bag. Try a small one first and see if your cat likes it (mine didn't care much for it, but luckily he still used the box!)Giving it two stars because it actually clumped very well. Changed to Ever Clean EverFresh and the odor issue has been solved."
1,My cats wouldn't use this litter,Luckily we got this free as a promotion because my cats would not use it. The one cried and cried and held it in until we got some tidy cats the next day. It looks like nice litter but I guess it's either the smell or the feel that they don't like. I am so glad it was free because I think it was a 9.00 bag and I would have been upset had I paid for it since I had to throw it out almost unused.
2,Tracks Dust ALL Over the House,"While World's Best does the job in terms of odor control, and does last a long time, after just 3-4 days, the litter crumbles to such an extent that it is like a powder, which sticks ALL over my two cats' paws and gets tracked all over the house, into my bed, and leaves a fine dust over the carpets. This happens even though I have a rug just outside the box to catch the worst of it, and sweep the room around it almost daily now. Each time, the dustpan is full of this powdered litter. The crumbling disintegration is part of what makes it flushable, I guess, but it also makes it unusable for me. I'm going to try the Healthy Pet litter, which comes in solid cellulose balls, so shouldn't crumble all over the place. It's also flushable, cost just $6 a bag, and has five stars here on Amazon."
1,MITE INFESTATION FROM THIS LITTER,"I have used WBCL for about 6 months because it is more environmentally friendly than clay litter. until now I have had no complaints. However, yesterday I noticed what looked to be a layer of dust on top of the litter box, and when I looked closely I realized it was a MOVING LAYER OF MICROSCOPIC MITES. and they are ALL OVER MY BATHROOM. I couldn't tell at first because the mites are very pale and very, very tiny, but once I started noticing them I saw they were covering - COVERING - my sink, toilet, shower tile, floor, TOOTHBRUSH, everything. I am so disgusted. There must have been millions of them in the litter. they seem to be grain mites, from what I can gather online, and I'm not the first person to experience a bug infestation from World's Best Cat Litter. Oh my god, I am never touching this stuff again. If you decide to buy it, BEWARE and keep an eye out for mites!"
3,Stinky,"I've given this product a good run of 4-5 months of use. My cats thought it was strange at first, but they used it. My biggest complaint is that it only stays fresh smelling for 3-4 days. A few days after changing out all of the litter it begins to take on a damp, sickly sweet corn smell--not a cat pee smell, but yucky nevertheless. I clean the 2 litter boxes twice a day (two cats in the house), and the pee clumps are fairly hard but tend to crumble more easily each day as the litter loses freshness. In other words, you really need to change out the litter every two weeks, which gets expensive. If you go longer than two weeks, the litter just smells offensive. I'm returning to cat crystals."
1,When Best becomes Worst,"One star only, as a warning. I have been using this product for 7-8 months.As long as the weather is dry, this litter is very good (I have 11 cats, they all use it)...BUT, since june, since the weather is humid, it's a catastrophy : the litter sucks all the humidity, melts and becomes a sticky dust that the cats bring all over the appartment.AVOID it only if you're leaving in tropical (like) places. Elsewhere, it's perfectly OK."
1,Cat hates smell.. Buy a small pack and try it first,"Although it clumps well,my cat objected to the smell. I introduced it gradually, but once litter was pure world's best, kitty pooped on the floor instead of in the litter. Switched back to clay and she was fine again."
2,A very good litter with one major drawback,"I used World's Best for about three years and really liked it for that whole time. It's lightweight, has a pleasant but unobtrusive odor, clumps well, and isn't dusty. My cats liked it fine. In short, I still really like the positive aspects of this litter.(All this refers to the World's Best in the green bag - the other type they sell has a nasty and fairly strong smell.)So why the low rating? Since this litter is made from corn, it's edible. As a few other reviewers have remarked, that means pests may be attracted to it as food. In my case, I discovered mice had invaded my apartment apparently just to get at the litter despite my five cats. Over the years I've also seen roaches around the litter boxes so they may have been eating it too.I like the idea of a green, biodegradable litter, but not if it means mice running across my floor. Ugh!"
3,"Much dustier than the ""Multi-Cat"" version","I've been a huge fan of this brand of litter for years now, since it makes the litter smell far less bad than clay/wood/paper/wheat, and I don't have to change out the entire box after a week due to urine dust/tiny bits stinking up the whole box.However, when my store only had this version available, I gave it a try. My poor black cat comes out of the box with white legs every time she uses it. From her toes up about 3 inches is entirely coated in the fine cream colored dust in the litter. It tracks onto all of the furniture leaving 8-10 little perfectly formed paw prints, and then she has to lick the rest off (which isn't really good for her, no matter what the litter is made of).The multi-cat version has far far less dust in it, and the clumps seems less fragile. Even if you only have one cat, get the red bag! Her feet rarely come out dusty with the multi-cat version, so the house stays much cleaner too."
1,dusty,I have a black cat and after filling the litter box with this he came out of the litter box beige. I have never had a litter that stuck to the cats this much. I had to clean him he left dusty paw prints all over. Having that much litter on them that they would later ingest can't be particularly good for their health.
1,P.U.! This is the World's Worst!,"Holy Cow! There is nothing ""BEST"" about this litter! If you LIKE the smell of cat urine, than this is the litter for you. I have only 1 cat, ONE little cat...and good Golly, this is the worst litter I have every used! This ""World's Best"" is truly the world's WORST! After one urination, it smells horribly of cat urine in our laundry room. YUCK YUCK YUCK!!! Back to Fresh Step we go. I NEVER smell my cat's urine with Fresh Step...I use the carbon version along with Fresh Step Crystals, 3:1 ratio and its perfect. I don't have to scoop it out for days, just change out the litter every 3-4 days and NEVER have I had the urine smell or any other smell, just a fresh clean smell."
1,We Needed Bug Spray When We Tried This Litter,"I would not advise anyone to try the World's Best Cat Litter. I was pleased about what I read - and was eager to try. I bought 2 of the small bags, saving them for an upcoming motor home trip. Oddly, none of our 3 cats would use the litter box - yet 2 of them crouched outside it, sort of in an 'observation' mode. Decided to look, and took the lid off. BIG mistake - little moths flew out everywhere. I clamped the lid on again quickly and we got the box outside - then made a mad dash for the nearest store to resupply our original brand of litter. So I have no real feel for how the product works - and don't intend to try it again. I also wrote the company twice and received no answer either time. Our advice is Don't Try It."
1,World's Worst Cat Litter!,"OMG, Worlds Best Cat Litter is a lie! It's the world's worst! It's expensive and has ZERO odor control. Yuck! So, so, sorry I wasted my money on this crap. Please don't buy it!"
1,Cat wouldn't use it.,"I wanted to get away from using clay, so I bought 2 bags of this stuff. I put a layer of clay on top of the corn litter. It smells like corn, and my cat thought it was food. He tried to eat it, once he got the litter stirred up a little. He used it a few times during the day, then later that evening I noticed he had not used it, he was holding it in. It also seemed to stick to his feet. We made a quick late night trip to the store and bought clay litter. We entirely replaced the litter with clay and he used his box immediately, biggest clump of clay I'd ever seen. I can't recommend this product to anyone, and I'm skeptical about using anything other than clay after this experience."
1,World's Worst Cat Litter,"My cat will not touch this litter. If we didn't have two boxes, he would pee all over the house rather than use it. It's made of corn and it attracts bugs, as well. I had to dump all of this litter out of his box and replace it with our usual litter. Definitely will not buy again or reccomend."
1,"Corn is food, right?","My cat torn through the bag when I brought it into the house. I thought, ""Oh Boy! This is going to be great."" The minute I poured it into the litter box, he hopped in and started EATING it. While it is non-toxic, it is CLUMPING! I removed him a couple times but he went right back to it even though it was clearly sticking in his mouth! I had to empty it right away and rush off to the store for a bag of my previous brand of litter. Crazy."
1,World's Worst Cat Litter,"I would rate this 0 if that choice was available. I tried this product this summer when they offered full-cost (sans tax) rebate. My 9 year old cat, who's NEVER had a problem urinating in his litter box suddenly stopped using it (and used my kitchen cabinet instead!). Luckily, I caught him the 2nd day. I was so ?$#* I called World's Worst Cat Litter 800 number to complain. The CS rep told me I should have started using their product by slowly adding small amounts to my old litter.Gee, I must have missed reading that on the bag.Instead of donating the litter to the local shelter I threw it out. Free isn't worth the smell of cat urine!BTW: the World's Worst Litter isn't cheap. I've had no problems using the cheap litter from the local big-box store.Buyer Beware!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM WORLDS BEST!,"Where to begin? I had high hopes for this litter as it was recommended by a few fellow cat owners. What a disappointment! My cats hated this stuff so much that one of them started peeing on our living room couch and walls! I have NEVER had this problem with him before. I spent more money cleaning up and removing the smell than I did on the litter. Also, my orange tabby's white paws turned a disgusting yellow color like he had been smoking for 20 years. Horrible at odor control and super dusty. Switched back to my old favorite litter and everything is back to normal. Stay away from this stuff!"
2,Smells like ammonia,"I like that this litter is environment-friendly, but it smells like ammonia after a short while, which is really unpleasant. It clumps alright, and there's not much dust, but the ammonia problem looms large. Also, I caught my cat nibbling on the litter (made from corn, of course) when poured into the box fresh - not what I want to see!For the same price I can get a bigger bag of Fresh Step, and I plan to switch back."
1,Not a good book really,This book was part of our course at KCL taught by Russell Winder and I don't think that more than two or three people understood it complete with the lectures. It jumps to a high level very quickly and just is very confusing indeed. I would not really recommend this book unless you know C++ very well as he seems to assume a lot of knowledge of this language. Not good for a first high level language book.
2,A programming book for programmers,"This book was a reccomended text for our degree course at Kings . I can say that this book would probably only appeal to programmers who are already familiar with C++ or other object oriented languages . There seems to be little structure to the explanation and is written in such an unfriendly and overcomplicated style that you're likely to go away feeling more confused and frustrated . As a reference tool it's poor as there are few definitions of terms used . It's aimed at the programmer producing medium to large scale java applications , if you're looking for something to explain objects or syntax look elsewhere ."
2,Where is Corky?!!!!,"I enjoy R.L. Stine, but this was his worst book ever. I have all the cheerleader books and I recently picked this garbage up. While it does follow the basic plot of the other cheerleader noviels this one is simple not well written. My ultimate question is Where is Corky? She should be the one to destroy the evil not some washed up has been. I'm extremly disappointed and may never buy another one of his books."
2,Is RL Stine going downhill in his writing or what?!?,"First thing, I loved the Cheerleaders 1-3 mostly because Corky was the main character. In this book she wasn't which was the first thing that made it bad. Second, it was over with in the third book. It didn't need to come back. But don't listen to me, after reading Christopher Pike's books I've hated the way RL Stine writes. I want to be a writer and I'd never take after Stine!"
3,What in the...?,"Okay, first of all, there were some good points, like the making and the history of the evil, but other than that it was kind of stupid. I mean, I have read all of the other Cheerleaders books and my favorite has been the first one. But not even Corky or Kimmy or even Ronnie or Debra are in this one. None of them are. It was kind of a disapointment. R.L. Stine better write a sequel to this one."
3,Not very good.,Not the best Cheerleaders book I've read. I think the first is my favorite. It is probably really cool to read if you want to know the history and making of the evil.
2,2 stars - and from a John Tesh fan!,"This CD contains a nice selection of music suitable for piano and orchestration - a pair from Phill Collins (You'll be in my heart and Against all odds) and Michael Legrand (Summer of 42 and Brian's Song)and a few ""standards"" - What a Wonderful World, Evergreen and the more recent Take My Breath Away.I would have rated it higher, but for the stilted piano playing and unimaginative orchestration especially on - What A Wonderful World, The Crying Game and She's Like the Wind (not a great tune anyways!)This CD has a real lack of feeling; its almost seems as if all the players are just going through the motions. Come on John - try adding some finesse or a few chords...something!!This was a real disappointment for me - and I do own and enjoy a number of his other collections.I would save your money and try some Richard Clayderman."
2,Quality poor,"It wasn't what I hoped for. The quality was poor, and, being of the generation that enjoyed these incredibly talented pianists, this did not include their all-time greatest hits and there were some I'd never heard in my life. In all, a disappointment."
2,poor quality,didnt look like the picture on your site. The blue topaz is very light in brightness and silver looks very cheap. Will not be buying jewelry from your site again!
4,"World's most boring bottle, but most wonderful perfume.","It's a shame Armani did so little with the bottle to express what a softly sensual scent it houses. It can be difficult to find a scent that's not over-powering while still conveying the 'come-hither' aura we females are trying to project. But Sensi is soft enough to wear during the day, unlike, say, Dior's J'Adore, and has been described by a male admirer of mine as 'nirvana'.There is no overwhelming top note, no big rose or jasmine explosion, so it all blends into an indulgent afternoon afterglow-type expression. It's not for teeny boppers but it isn't exclusively for grand dames either. Any grown woman could wear it with ease. (Wow, describing a perfume is difficult.) I'd give it five stars were it not for the totally boring bottle. For this kind of money, some crystal glamour would be nice."
2,HP - What Happened to Quality?,"I ordered this printer as a GoldBox item for Christmas. Received it and spent weeks trying to get it installed. Finally, after spending an additonal $50 for tech support through Office Max, it is up and running. The photos are nothing to brag about but not awful either. The ink is somewhat blotchy and looks like it was embossed on the photo paper. Not smooth like I would expect. Normal copies are OK, but again not great. So far, I haven't had a problem with the ink cartridges running out so that's a good thing. All in all, I wish I had had another $100 to buy a better model."
4,Great Printer,"This is a great printer to have around the home. The only thing that I didn't like about this printer is that you cannot print documents directly from a flash/thumb drive. In the description, it says that you don't need a pc to print...not true. On a positive note, it is a great printer."
1,Not quite Vista ready,"This was a terrific printer for me, excellent pictures and good support for the occasional larger document.Then I upgraded from Windows XP to Vista.The D7160 still prints excellent pictures, but chokes on documents of large file size. I've done clean installs of the latest printer drivers and spent many hours with HP and Microsoft people to try to resolve the issue. At this point, it seems clear to me that HP has chosen not to support this line as standalone printers. HP salespeople have steered me away from the Photosmart line and the HP Home and Home Office site no longer lists duplexers for any of the Photosmart printers (after several months of identifying them as ""out of stock"").I don't have room for two printers on my desk, don't want to maintain another set of mutually incompatible cartridges, and don't want to compromise on photo quality. If you need a printer that can produce high quality prints and the occasional document as well, you should probably look elsewhere."
1,Won't install,Ugh! Just got this and the darned thing will not install. The new hardware wizard pops up during the HP Software installation and says it cannot find the required section in the INF. Furthermore the HP Software doesn't see the printer. HP is so far no help at all. Getting ready to send this puppy back to the store and try another printer.
4,"Great printer, but kind of ""clunky"" looking","All my past printer purchases have been HP and for good reason - they're a reliable printer brand with quality results. My former HP printers looked sleek and worked great for many years. This current model (as well as other Photosmart models) does a great job at printing high-quality photos. I have no complaints with it except for its slightly bulky appearance. It's roughly the size of the All-In-Ones. Nevertheless, it still does not take up much room on my desk, but I wish HP would follow Apple's and other electronic manufacturers' lead by making products sleeker and not bigger as years progress. It's a very affordable printer with great printing results for everyday use and photo printing."
4,"Great, as expected from HP","This printer is better than I expected. It is easy to use and very predictable. It is now my preferred ""quick and dirty"" printer. Paper feeds great and the color photo prints are very sharp and VERY quick. For making quick and cheap prints it excels.One very important note is that it is not good for archival prints. The ink is dye based and, as such, it fades. This is contrary to the claims of HP. I wouldn't count on these prints staying sharp for more than a couple of years. Just go over some text with a highlighter or splash a little soapy water on the prints and they smudge or dissolve. For archival you still really need to go with pigment based ink."
3,HP Photosmart D7160 All in one printer,"I read reports on this printer and that is why I purchased it, and it was reasonably priced. Now that I have had it so quit sometime I was rather pleased with most of the job that it has produced. BUT I hadn't really used to scaner portion until I needed to. It only produced one clear copy and the rest were unreadable or scaning a picture it came out terrible. Then I tried to use the copy feed at the top of the machine and this didn't work at all well-distortions on every copy. I thought I was doing something wrong so I went to Best Buy to talk to a technician and see if I could be doing sometning wrong. He told me that these in expensive models are not reliable and the cost to repair was not worth the price but to just buy a new one. So I have been very disappointed besides it doesn't enlarge copies that you might need to enlarge. Not sure I would buy the products from HP again. Needs to be presented better on all of the features."
3,Very Good For the Money,"Bought the D1760 in November 2006 and unit worked flawlessly at first. I was intrigued by the 1 black and 6 smaller color ink cartriges. This made sense when we bought as the small cartridges are only $10 each. Why replace a tri-color when only one color runs out, right? I am very pleased with this feature. It's been 14 months and the unit has been acting a little quirky of late. Keeps giving 'Ink System Failure' messages whenever a cartridge gets replaced, but once you get working, it prints quickly and has great color resolution. Very pleased with the $105 investment. Recommend the extended warranty, though."
2,"Good printer when it works, paper jams often","Printer worked very well for about 6 months. But I put some photopaper in, and since then jams are very common even with plain paper."
5,WORKS GREAT FOR ME!,"I've had this printer for quite a while and am very happy with the photos I print. Many people have asked me where I get my photos developed, and they're surprised to hear that I print them off myself. Color and clarity are great on both glossy and semi-gloss papers. The printing speed is a little slow, but it's worth the wait. Reason I got this printer, is that it was recommended to me by my nephew who works for HP. He asked around with his fellow workers: consensus was that it's not a super expensive printer, but it does fantastic photo printing. I agree and haven't even thought about changing printers."
4,Like it!,This is a really good printer for my needs. I only use it a few times a week. The color is excellent. I'm looking forward to printing off more pictures.
4,Good printer for price and my use,"This is a good printer for home user wanting to do pictures and some presentation papers ,,there are better and there are worst ,this is the one that fits my needs and wants,,but for the price of the cartridges it is very good ,,my last HP the cartridge replacements were more than what this one cost and this one has card reader and some adjustments built in...would be a 5 but i think the product booklet could be better at explaining features.."
1,replace the yellow 3 times in 3 months,This printer is five stars in clear quality printing photos and graphics (what I do for a living) but buy three yellow ink cartridges at a time because it sucks up the yellow like no other printer I have worked with. MY god could HP fix this already I have had this printer for 3 months and I haven't had to change any of the other cartridges yet that came with the printer but I have had to replace the yellow 3 times. What a waste because I rarely print anything that has yellow hues. I recommended this printer to another graphic artist before the yellow started running out and now she is have the same issue as well. She had the printer for only 1 month and has had to replace the yellow 2 times. Based on the slow down of work and cost of having to constantly replace the yellow cartridge I would not recommend this printer. FYI Tec support is no help in this matter.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this printer in May, 2007 from a website other than Amazon. It printed amazing picture quality. Two weeks ago it started to make a banging noise. I immediately called HP support and they determined I needed a replacement and told me it was out of warranty, which it wasn't. Two weeks later, 10 emails, 6 faxes and 6 phone calls and internet chats in the process, I still do not have a replacement printer. HP has the worst customer support imagineable. I've been lied to and promised things that did not occur. If you want a printer that is reliable and has good technical support don't buy an HP, it is not worth the hassle. I wish I had my cannon printer back that I had for 7 years."
5,Best Collection of Steinbeck Novels,The Library of America editions are a great way to own a Collection of novels from a great writer; The compact hardbound edition has a dust jacket and is a nice addition to your bookshelves; and these particular Steinbeck novels can be read over and over:The Moon Is Down / Cannery Row / The Pearl / East of Eden
3,"It is all right, but could be better","This disc has P&G's 10 big hits from 1964 to 1967. It does, sadly, have several tracks rechanneled that are readily available in true stereo. The collectables discs or the imports EP collection and Original Hits are much better albums and feature much more for those who want to hear a more complete and varied selection of P&G. A good album for those seeking just a greatest hits package."
3,"Great songs, except for the duophonic tracks!","This CD is about as limited as they get. It fetures some of P & G's most fabulous hits, but, unfortunantly ""Nobody I Know,"" ""True Love Ways,"" and ""Woman"" are in horrid duophonic. Why Capitol didn't use the true stereo mixes I will never know. It is good for a basic P & G album."
4,They did justice to the Beatles' give-aways,"The four Lennon-McCartney tracks here, mostly Mac efforts, receive pretty good and pretty distinctive treatment, despite at times overwrought or somewhat cornball arrangements. These songs are also covered by Pierson, Parker and Janovitz on their absolutely masterful 2003 CD `Songs from a Window: Lost Songs of Lennon and McCartney'. However, I'd say that Peter and Gordon's `60s charm gives them a slight edge. So if you're putting together CD-Rs of the songs that John, Paul (and George) gave away after deciding not to finish or even start recording, then I recommend lifting from this CD: `A World Without Love', `Nobody I Know', `I Don't Want to See You Again' and `Woman' (by Mac under the name B. Webb)."
4,My son loves these shoes,My son loves these shoes. It's the only shoe he has worn for the past two years. They are good sturdy shoes. The only complaint is that the threading typically comes lose in the velcro piece and the velcro picks up lots of threads.
1,not for fans of the great music of the 70's flo and eddie,"a major dissapointment for me. for their first ""new"" album in soooo many years, i was sorry to hear a reggae flavor on every track. i'm a flo and eddie fan, not even a little reggae fan. i wish i could return it."
1,They Missed Funny & Went Straight To Stupid,"If you're looking for Frank Zappa's wit and humor, check out Zappa. If you just want ""clever,"" search for Weird Al or Spike Jones. If you want to hear the Turtles, buy their old CDs. You won't find any of that in Flo and Eddie.Al Nichol was the genius behind the Turtles, along with extraordinary drummer Johnny Barbata. Mark (Flo) and Howard (Eddie) have karaoke voices and are about as witty as a used Q-Tip.This is a waste of money. Just don't bother."
1,The Siege Rip Off,"Its a rip-off. It contains the same episodes as ""The Adventure Begins"" 1 - 6. I thought it was another episode in addition to 1 - 6. Kind of like buying two different albums, both of which contain the same songs. Rip-off"
2,boooooooo!!!!,"I've read redwall 5 times went over every detail and well this sucks it add things that should be left left out important details and worst of all got a twrrible basil stag hare voice! He in my opinion was the best book charactor,but they ruined him here in this. I am refering to the tv version i pray for the dvd release that they atleast recast basil stg hare. P.S. In case anyone wants to know all my classmates and friends who saw it (about 20-25 people) thought I, Ian William Anderson, did a much better job at basil's voice "" Eh! Wot!"""
4,"It's all about ""Love Gun""","When I first saw this cd in stores, I overlooked it because I didn't expect much from it. When I heard samples from the internet's ""Amazon"" site, I needed to buy it badly. This is a very well put together CD. Kiss and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra did a ""heluva"" job.My personal favorite tracks are #9 ""I was made for lovin' you"", and my all time favorite Kiss song, #6 ""Love Gun"". Paul Stanley's voice is on fire on this track and personally, I think that this is the best version of ""Love Gun"" Kiss has ever performed. I love that song. Every die hard Kiss fan should have this C.D in their collection. Trust Me, it's worth it!!!P.S I acually give this Alive IV 4.8 stars out of 5. :)"
3,Good performances...very bad mix,"Pete's drums just get lost in the sound, and it's too bad. His playing is the best it's been in years. For some reason, on each of the live Kiss recordings, the drums have been buried in the murk, and that includes Alive 3, with Eric Singer.Otherwise, it's good. Let's hope for a different song list if they continue touring."
5,LARGER THAN LIFE -MEGABOMBASTIC KISS EXPERIENCE ENERGY,"This compilation is excellent, the art of the CD too. I can't wait to see the full show on DVDIf somebody is a starter on the KISS camp, by far Alive, Destroyer, Revenge, Unplugged and Now Alive IV are their best discsThanks KISS for not takin' too seriously the farewell tour (I hope Ace would think the same)"
5,What a waste of paper and plastic...,"No, I'm not a tree hugging hippie... what I am, is a dissapointed Kiss fan. I was so excited when my fiance told me she bought me tickets to see Kiss in San Diego... so excited in fact that I rushed out to get my fix of Kiss (Kiss Alive IV that is). I wish I could rush back to Newbury Comics to get my money back. It's not the same without ACE!!!! The disc is very bland, blah, bad, and what ever word starting with ""b"" you can think of. I guess I'll have to sell it and get only a quater of what I paid for it... []"
2,Something new from Kiss that's not a compilation!,"However this thing falls flat on it's face for two reasons; Peter Criss' subpar drumming and the precense of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra/Ensemble. Kiss music was at it's best simple and had a no-nonsens attitude about it. Here are a bunch of classics, first Kiss go themselves, then a minor input comes from the orchestra and the second disc is extremely annoying to listen do, due to the disturbing noises from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the background.I would have preferred the original version of ""Alive IV"", which was to be released prior to their ""Farewell Tour"".Absent is Ace Frehley, but I couldn't care less.The packaging of this limited version is great however and the majority of the songs are excellent - no less than 7 cuts are from their classic ""Destroyer""-album. These two things represent the two stars."
1,Wow....the apocalypse,"I think the manufacture and sale of this cd is the 2nd sign of the apocalypse. We are all going to perish. This CD ranks up there with the William Shatner cd, and Milli Vanilli (whose Grammy was the 1st sign). Do people really listen to this dreck?"
1,Time for Kiss to pack it up !,I have been a Kiss fan soince I was 11 years old ! My first album was Kiss Alive II.Jumping on the band wagon of band performing live with a symphony this cd is terrible. The sound quality is muddled and Peter Criss is slugging away at the drums out of time and was showed the door AGAIN by Gene and Paul.I would not buy this cd for a nickel and in fact the copy I have was given to me and does nothing more than collect dust.Go buy Savatage to hear Rock with a symphony !
1,The worst of the Live albums,"This is simply awful, and an embarrasment for Kiss. Alive had so much energy to it, I would never expect any other Live release by Kiss to come close. But this is so off the mark. The production is weak, distorted, and treble-happy. Paul Stanley doesn't sing anymore, he simply tries to see how high he can sing. Simmons has lost his voice. And worst yet, the orchestra simply doesn't go with Kiss Songs. The most enjoyable part of this CD are the first five songs without the orchestra, but then you realize that it's not ACE playing, but Tommy Thayer of Black and Blue fame playing Ace's chops, exactly. How about a little bit of originality? Couldn't you have added a little more guitar solo to Deuce or Strutter? This is a sell out, friends. Go listen to ALIVE again, and wish what was, and not what could be."
5,"Sym""phony"" Not At All Fake","This is one of KISS' best ALIVE! albums. They not only do songs in a pure rock n' roll spirit, they also perform them with the aid of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I've heard people say that because of the symphony, KISS is suck-ish. This is far from the truth. KISS actually improves the sound of their songs by doing them with a classical touch. This is a must-buy for any KISS fan."
1,this joke of a band now doing symphony?,whos still buying kiss cds? You know its over when they have to rehash their old bad songs into symphony format. what a joke.
5,Awesome experience,"The magic is back. An excellent rendition of their music combined with an orchestra. The sound is fantastic. I can't wait for the release of the dvd. Although Ace Frehley is not involved in this project, Tommy Thayer is amazing. He even looks lke Ace with his makeup. Detroit Rock City is incredible. It is a must in your collection. Play it loud!!!!!"
2,Time for a finale.....,"The ship is running out of steam and Gene is running out of ways to re-package the same classic KISS tunes. This is far from the Metallica treatment the orchestral arrangements sound silly (sorry that's the only word I can think of to describe it) and thrown in for the sake of having it there - thank God for the first six tracks which save this disc...and sorry Tommy, you're not Ace - the leads sound like a KISS tribute guitarist (which, suprise, he was) - playing very polished versions of leads that were raw. ..."
1,I'm sad!,"hard to say but this record is a useless, bad album for a dying band. once again the same songs, tommy is a good player but is not ace. is peter criss playing? I really can't hear him. the mixing sucks. now kiss are nothing more than a las vegas attraction. for my favourite band a sad goodbye."
2,Not worth your $$,"First of all, why did I spend my money on this? If you have any of the previous live albums don't wast your time/$$ on this. Most of these tracks are available on Alive I-III and certainly sound better on those. The only gimmick that seperates this album is the Melbourne Symphony, which can hardly be heard and the arrangements bring nothing to the songs. They could achieved the same thing with Paul Shaefer on keyboards. Buy this album only if you're from Australia and desperately need to hear a live version of ""Shandi"" that sounds almost as unappealing as...the studio version. As a HUGE fan that has every album I've finally gotten sick of more and more of the same. If you're a new fan: buy Alive I-III. If you're an old fan: Go listen to your copies of Alive 1-III instead. This might be decent when they release it on DVD though. Save your cash for that and buy a concert ticket instead."
1,Save Your Money,"There are few who are bigger fans of Kiss than myself. With that in mind (so you don't think I'm just randomly bashing the group)this CD is sorely lacking. If you like your Kiss neutered, this might be the album for you. I realize this is a 'symphony' cd, but some groups just don't take well to this type of mix. Well, it just doesn't work here. All the spice is gone from the songs and what you're left with is bland, uninspiring music. To call this Alive IV is blasphemy and soils the previous great Alive LPs. All that being said, as much as I miss Ace, Tommy Thayer really kicks on the first 6 tracks which are just the band without the symphony. Since they had to do it,they should have made the Farewell Tour PPV Alive IV, and put this out on it's own separately. Seeing how greedy the band is now I'm surprised they didn't think of it. Buy the remastered Alive II and listen to what a kick a$$ band sounds like."
3,Not the best of orchestra albums,"After Metallica and other bands performed with a live orchestra KISS wanted to get in on it. Well this is not one of the best symphony/rock albums out there. Sometimes you cannot even hear the sypmhony over the guitars bass and drums. Also Paul's voice sounds awful in this album. I believe, if they had recorded it better and used better placement of microphones and equipment ir would of come out much better."
4,"It's an ok album, but they need to do some real work.....","I give this 4 stars, because it's a decent record. The band sounds tighter then they have in years. Peter is still not great, but he's making an effort here. Paul is losing his singing voice. Gene has already lost his. Peter was the only one that could still sing. This disc is worth it just for the version of ""Beth"". Tommy is a good guitarist. Ace isn't hear, get over it. He wants to record new music, which he could have done while still in KISS, but he's not known for smart choices. The production is pretty good. Overall, I would say this is worth owning if you're a KISS fan, but don't expect anything shockingly new here. ""Lick It Up"" was included, which is pretty cool, as that was one of the band's best albums."
1,Crappy re-packaging....,"I've always been a Kiss fan but ever since the reunion of the original line-up in 1996 their (old) songs have been rehashed and repackaged too often. The DVD version of Symphony is AWESOME and the sales figures of it say it all: Kiss is an audio-visual spectacle, hence the excellent sales of the DVD. On double CD -especially the 'limited' (ahum...) edition digi-pack - the band rocks equally fantastic but the general audience didn't buy the album so saleswise the CD version failed miserable. Let me make clear that this album deserved to be #1 but this cheaply repackaged single disc.... what a joke !!! The beautiful digi-pack double CD only costs some $ 4 more than this sh**ty CD and who oh who is gonna buy it then ??? If you want this CD, spend the $ 4 extra and get the digi-pack double CD."
2,YOU WANTED THE BEST...YOU DIDN'T GET IT...,"Let me start out by saying that I'm as big a KISS fan as anybody can attest to - 30 years of amassed albums, memorabilia. etc... That being said... this album deserves a collective YAWN... It's not REALLY KISS - Ace Frehley bailed out...I swear I'll never buy another KISS album that's just a retread of everything else, a bunch of the same stuff in different wrapping, and that's all this is. Sure they added an orchestra - unless somebody told you it was there, I'm not sure you'd realize it on most of the songs, and where you can hear it, adds no real value, anyways. I'm sick of the same ol' renditions of Detroit Rock City, Shout it Out Loud, R&R All Night, Duece, blah, blah, blah... Shandi was a nice touch, but stuck to the studio sound...Don't waste your money - there's nothing ear-catching about this CD...NOTE TO KISS - How about either hitting the studio for something new, or digging into the vault a little bit for something new and different..."
1,Money-grubbing weasels...,"The only (and I mean ONLY) reason to buy this disc is if you're a hard-core fan and absolutely *must* have the bonus track on it. And if you ask me, having KISS fans buy Alive IV *twice* to get all the material from the shows is a pretty lame thing for Gene Simmons to do (tho not surprising). Instead, buy the two-disc limited-edition version of Alive IV (or even better - buy the DVD) and purchase the bonus track from one of the music download services."
3,"If you want the music from the DVD, get this...","I got this before I got the DVD, and I got the DVD of Alive IV later. If you want to listen to the music from the show in your car, then this is worth the purchase. Otherwise, there are no surprises. It's the exact same material. And I'd be willing to bet from the abyssmal sales of the CDs that people realize that KISS is simply a big audio visual show and not a band to listen to on CD anymore. This is especially obvious since the Alive DVD has gone multi-platinum and the CD release has failed to even go gold.."
1,Simply Horrible!!!,If I could give it 0 stars I would! Rock & Symphony music do not mix well whatsoever at all!!!
2,"Great Package For Collectors, Otherwise Boring","I first saw KISS in 1977 at The Nassau Coliseum in New York.I say this because it was just before they exploded (no pun intended) into superstars. The only time I saw that ""hunger"" again was their reunion tour in the late 90's, but that was fleeting.This is a great package, as KISS has never been known to skimp in that area, but the music itself adds to the parody they have created. The orchestral arrangements are predictable and do nothing for the songs.I was embarassed to hear a 50+ year old Paul Stanley stating ""is this cool, or what?"" into the mike more than once.What would be ""cool"" is for Simmons and Stanley to bow out now with whatever grace they have left."
2,Wanted: A REAL Drummer,"If they have someone filling in for Ace Frehley then for crying out loud get Peter Criss the hell out of there! If Eric Singer had played on this set then it would have certainly been better. Unfortunately, we're forced to suffer through Criss's poor playing and musicianship. (Yes, I can do better) Other than that, the symphony sounds good but I can't figure out why they are there. The symphony isn't realy an integral part of the sound like the horns are in Chicago's sound. The best thing about this set was the inclusion of a few obscure tunes like Great Expectations & Shandi. Bottom line: This project had so much potential....but KISS didn't come through on this one."
1,dosent sound like kiss,okay first off lemme say im a big kiss fan. okay now this cd isnt kiss its symphony. the symphony on here ruins all the kiss songs on here it doesent sound good at all it sounds horrible with the whole symphony. dont buy this cd stay away from it
3,Simply Mundane,Overall performing with the symphony was no big deal. Still a lil boring with the same old songs. Nice to have Peter Criss involved though.
2,"How do you spell ""Disappointment""?","Even though I have been a fan of KISS for the past 25 years, this album has left me scratching my head. While the string arragements on some songs (most notably ""Beth"" and ""God Of Thunder"") are worthwhile, this album is barely better than Metallica's S&M.While alledgedly attempting to broaden their horizons and adding to the ""Alive"" legacy, this album does not come close to the others. I'd even go as far as to say it tarnishes the body of work left by the other ""Alive"" albums. The idea of performing with a symphonic orchestra is no longer original and is slowly becoming something that the music business and music fans alike can easily do without.On the upside, I got this as a Christmas gift, so I didn't have to pay for it. But this if there ever was a case for file sharing, this is it. Two or three songs are worth having and the others are throw-aways."
1,Enough is Enough!,"Well, having been a KISS fan over 25 years I must say I am upset with the guys. Starting in 1998 I thought I was in for a real treat with ""Psycho Circus."" Wow, was I wrong. It was over-hyped, poorly written, and it's lack of sales was no surprise. The ""3-D"" tour was a joke, too! They did the farewell tour right though, and that should've been their swan song.Alive IV is all about money, and they couldn't write good new songs if they tried!! Enough is enough, and I will not be buying anymore KISS-related items!! Hey, Gene get a freaking clue and listen to what the real fans are telling you. By the way, when was the last time one of your albums actually went PLATINUM? huh??"
3,"A re-release of Kiss Alive IV as a single disc, added bonus track to try and get a few extra bucks from fans.","Unfortunatly, Sanctuary records has found a way to try and milk the public out of a few more dollars. this was originally released as a nice two disc set including all of these song, but on this album they added a bonus track, yeah. I wouldn't knock down doors for this one. I suggest if you feel compulsed to buy one of the Alive IV sets, get the digipak. More songs and symphony. Kiss Symphony isn't anything groundbreaking in the world of rock, but it's not a bad twist on the Alive series. If you like Kiss Alive!, check out the new Alive Box set from mercury, it has all 3 of the original ALive albums from mercury, and the Alive millenium concert, originally slated to be Alive IV, but not release until this year and the box set. So caution with this single disc, not a must have."
3,"Not a bad album at all, but....","The point here is really only one: if you like compilations (liev or not, with orchestra or not) by a beloved band of yours, then you will buy it. On the other side, if you already HAVE all the products by this band and, even so, decides to buy this one, you're a completist. And there's nothing wrong with that.The truth is that this album is nothing more than a curiosity in KISS catalogue. It's not worth a penny in terms of freshness, new songs, whatever. But, if you want to listen KISS playing with orchestra, where else will you find it? Only here!To put it short: this is not a bad album, but a desnecessary item in your rock collection."
1,This sucks.,The beginning before the stupid violins was awesome but a symphony + KISS or Metallica = epic FAIL!
3,"Decent, but nothing earth-shattering.","Let me start off by saying you can't make a new ""Space Ace"" just by putting on the Ace Frehley make-up; Ace IS ""spacey!"" I also don't understand why Bruce Kulick was not the replacement. That said, I get to my review. KISS plays well, but is this album/CD neccessary? It is a shame Ace wasn't on it, but Thayer plays all his parts well. I just have trouble digesting him in Ace's make-up(maybe that is suitable for the DVD review). Thayer really nails the KULICK solo on ""Forever."" The band plays well with the symphony, but only sound exeptional on a few tracks.Some songs really are not symphony ""stuff."" A good, decent show,but mainly for the hardcore(which I guess I am because I bought it!)."
2,"A ONE MORE BEST OF, THAT'S ALL","I was really happy when I bought the CD, wouaow KISS with a philarmonic orchestra, it will sounds just great.BUT, when I puted the CD in the cd-recorder, I heard an other best of KISS, nothing more. Did they listened to SCORPIONS philarmonic album or METALLICA ? Thoses 2 were really kicking, they let the classical musicians play on their way but KISS playes like KISS, so it is a good album but if you have the best of, the very best of and all the best of they realeased almost every years, DO NOT buy it. Sorry KISS, but this is true and I am a die hard fan since 1977."
1,Tommy Who ???,"It is time to hang up the platforms. Without Ace is it truly KISS in makeup ? No, it isn't. Wasn't Alive IV already an album recorded on the Farewell Tour ? As a die hard KISS fan, it breaks my heart to see the state of the band the way that it is. Tommy Thayer ? Come on."
1,Shame on DG!,"Thank you for the warning. I already suspected this was a rerelease, but it's good to know for sure. Shame on DG for not making this clear. There are at least 2 far better recordings of the Actus Tragicus (106), the Leonhardt recording on TELDEC and the Ricercar Consort recording on the Belgian label Ricercar. Don't bother with the Gardiner."
4,Good/Not Great,"I adore Marian Keyes. Her novels are among my favorites. Her writing style is just so hysterical, while at the same time heart wrenching! Sometimes I wonder, ""How did this woman nail how I feel about this/that so well?"" If you also adore her, read this book! It's very much a companion book to ""Under the Duvet"" - so if you enjoyed that, then you'll enjoy this.However, don't let this be the FIRST Keyes you read. I think after reading some of her novels and getting a feel for her style/characters then the essays are eye opening and touching. But if you have no connection with her fictional stories, you may ask yourself, ""So what?""Read some of her other books first - all are pretty great - and then come back to her essays."
2,No wonder they broke up,"I've been a big Pantera fan since Vulgar Display of Power was released but this album is pretty lame, especially when one looks at the quality of their material on CfH, VDoP, and FBD. There is a difference between noise and music and a couple of these tracks cross that line. Sure, there's the small universe of ultra-hardcore fans who love anything Pantera records (""best album ever""? Give me a break), but anyone else can hear that this is pretty weak material for the most part.It's sad to see a band that was so good implode on itself. Pantera went downhill fast after Vulgar Display of Power. No wonder they broke up. Like another reviewer said: if this album was by anyone other than Pantera, it would be getting trashed left and right."
1,Way Overated Band and CD,"I bought Great Southern Trendkill thinking Pantera was one of the greatest metal bands around. Turns out I was wrong. I can't believe I wasted my money . I praise Phil Anselmo's ability to scream for an entire album without having to take a breath. He uses the f-word more than 30 times each on the first two songs, the title song plus War Nerve. That said, this is a bad Cd by an even worse band. Don't buy it or anything by Pantera. You'll regret it. At least I got my money back to buy a Preist CD."
1,Aaagghhh!!!!.....,What's with these bozos and their fans? How can you guys possibly love this? Pantera is the most talentless metal band around and Great Southern Trendkill proves it.
1,"Loud, Noisy, Profane and Nothing More","If you like unoriginality, profanities, bad riffings, etc.,etc., than this ""album"" is for you! Pantera is the worst excuse for a metal band."
4,Not as hard hitting,"If you are like me, you were probably hoping for a Hard hitting album, unlike Far beyond driven right? Wrong it's not as heavy. Sure songs like ""The Great Southern Tredkill"" are heavy as hell! Totally intense, than you get songs that are just tooooooooo slow for Pantera. I'm sure if you can handle slow songs your down with it, but for me and many others it must be fast. Which it isn't, thank your for listening."
3,Hmmmmm,"This is a good cd. Kinda mellow compared to Vulgar and Far Beyond, butit's got that heavy touch to it. It's a great cd, but I recommend Vulgar Display of Power overall. My Fav songs on this cd: ""Suicide note Pt II"" and ""Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath)"" Pantera's my favorite band, and also I own their Pre-Phil Anselmo cds ""projects in the jungle"" and ""metal Magic"" which is nothing like more recent Pantera (it's more like Skid Row and Motley Crue) but if ur a hardcore Pantera fan and would like to hear these cds...email me at DethGrl4x4@aol.com"
4,a little hard to understand,"Folllowing in the style of Far beyond driven with Anselmo screaming for most of the songs. This album can be annoying if you do not know the lyrics. There is alot of power in the songs however. espicially in ""13 steps"" and ""the great southern trendkill"" this album also has alot of slower songs in it such as ""suicide note pt1."" Which is followed by Anselmo screaming at the top of his lungs in ""suicide note pt2"" the album looses some speed near the end and sounds a bit repitive but this is still a gold album."
4,"Absolutly mind-blowing, but not their best","This is a great album, not only does it show superior talent, but it shows the full talent of Mr. Phil Anselmo's writing skills. The only reason I gave this recording 4 stars is because i believe Vulgar Display of Power to be their best, and this does not tie for 5 stars to VDOP. Pantera is the greatest band ever, and I applaud anything they do."
5,One of their best,"Second to their great live album Official Live: 101 proof. The Great Southern Trendkill is Pantera's best CD. It is absolutely the hardest music out there. It's not slow metal like they put out on Far Beyond Driven, but fast speed metal that a non metal listener will agonize in pain listening too, but a metal fan will without a dought love it."
3,"2.5, a mixed bag.","Though Pantera is a great metal band, this album is a slight downfall. Though Drag the Watres, War Nerve, and Floods are all good, they and the whole album are just dull and repetitive. This also even lacks speed from previous efforts. Though this has some half decent tracks, this overll is a slight downslide. The best Pantera albums would be Cowboys from Hell, Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. Those had every bit of rage in the lyrics, heavier and speedier riffs and more diversity, this is seems like they ran out ideas. This is just had monotone chugging riffs. Comaprd to if those three, this jiust lacks the flare and energy that those all had. If you already have this, then give a small spin on occaisoion, but if you don't it's not worth picking up. This lacks. Their newest Reivventing the Steel was a great comeback though and wipes this out."
4,My Fave,"Pantera cd. Shows more depth than other releases. A much darker jouney of the mind. The Sabbath-esqu sound of 10's, floods to ""13 Steps"" (one of their best tracks) and the slamming Title track and Suicide Note #2, its all there. I really liked this direction for the band, it was a much darker and definately better wriiten (lyrically), though the sales were down on this one. An essential metal Masterpiece.Best Tracks : Drag the Waters, 10's, 13 Steps, Suicide Notes 1 & 2,Floods"
4,I send out a big F U to the previous reviewer,"GSTK is a damn good album. Pantera are really working around in their niche, experimenting on almost every track. There is something slightly different in each track. It has a real groove to the whole album. Good production, you can see they are changing each album, increasing more diverse. Dimebag is the Man, and Vinnie Paul speaks for himself. A drummer's drummer to the core. These dudes rock, and they definitely bring a lot to metal. Glad I got this album. BTW don't listen to the last reviewer. Death metal is GOD, and anyone to soft to handle it shouldn't be listening to Pantera. GREAT ALBUM< GREAT BAND"
3,LOUD and takes time getting used to!!!,"This is loud and heavy. Songs like ""10s"" and ""Floods"" and ""Suicide Part 1"" give the album its taste! Everything else, you have to read the lyrics to understand what Phil Anselmo is screaming about! I must applaud them on their lyrics. I can't say if their opinions and views of society are accurate but it is their opinion and they voice it well. Overall this album does need work musically wise, it needs more melodys in the songs and more singing and less screaming!"
3,"Powerful and crazy, but lacking lyrically.","There is no doubt this album is not lacking in intensity, emotion, and energy. Just listen to that scream on ""Suicide Note Pt. II"" and you'll see what I mean. Driving guitars again and powerful rhythms. But like I said in my review of ""Far Beyond Driven"" I just have problems with these guys lyrically. A little too crude and self-absorbed for me. I like my metal with a little more far-reaching lyrics. Bands like Earth Crisis, Strife, One King Down, Machine Head, and Vision of Disorder take it to another level. --Kelly Magovern"
1,I Hated It. Don't Buy G.S.T.,I just wish the warning label was much bigger and noticeable. Vulgar Display of Power is not THIS profane. Pantera is a way overhyped metal band and Trendkill proves it. I would rather listen to none other than Marilyn Manson than this! Now I find his music(not image!)entertaining. Even HE doesn't swear as much as Pantera's Phil Anselmo.
1,IT ACTUALLY DESERVES NO STARS!,THIS BAND IS THE WORST BAND IN THE WORLD! I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BLAZER FOR A WHILE.MAYBE HE GOT MY MESSAGE ON MY REVIEW.HE KNOWS WHO I AM AND HE IS JUST AFRAID OF ME.I GOT TOLD OFF BY HIM A FEW WEEKS AGO BECAUSE I THREW SOMETHING AT HIS GIRLFRIEND.SHE DESERVED TO GET THAT BRICK THROWN AT HER BECAUSE THE GUY IN THE BLAZER IS HER BOYFRIEND AND HE IS ALWAYS MAKING ME MAD WITH HIS MUSIC. SINCE I AM AFRAID OF HIM BEATING ME UP I WILL PUNISH HER FOR HIS ACTIONS.THAT IS THE BEST THING TO DO.MY FRIEND ANGIE LIKES TO HELP ME THROW STUFF AT HER BUT SHE ALWAYS MISSES.BECAUSE OF ANGIE I KNOW WHAT THE GIRLS NAME IS AND WHAT HER BOYFRIENDS NAME IS.SO WATCH OUT!
1,Is This Some Sort Of Joke?,"If most metal singers sound like Phil, than the end of metal is near. A lot of people told me that Pantera is THE base of metal. If so, than metal is dying. First of all, the only thing that is heavy about Pantera and G.S.T. is Phil's screamings, cussings, and rude subject matter. His vocals and lyrics are terrible. As for Dime's gtrs., who wants to hear the same 2 chords(3 at maximum)over and over. Usually the riffs aren't even in chords. Just single notes(gasp). And there's usually only one guitar playing. Most metal bands have two and sometimes three guitars playing generaly 4/5/6 chord riffs(Metallica for example). As for Rex's bass, you never can hear it. One wonders if it's even there. Vinnie is the worst drummer ever. He drums worst than a gorilla and rarely uses a bass drum. There is hundred's of other great metal bands out there other than Pantera. Go listen to Slayer."
1,NO!,How can you guys possibly call this talent? anyone who gives this 5 stars has something wrong with them. Trendkill is just noise filled with bloodcurling screams. And like tonsa swearing. This is what happens when record companies allow bands with no talent to get record deals. Phil Anselmo just wish he had talent. So he just makes an album filled screams. Go listen to something else!
5,If Hell was in youd sell your soul,This albulm brings together Phils frustrations and experiences to an explosive rolling groove of strength and aggression. I find it a must if you are a true PanterA fan because it describes a side of PanterA not covered in previous albulms. It is very well thought out albulm and depicts all the pathetic media and trendy scams of america.. to you i say The Trend is dead and gone ..forever hostile.
4,POWERFUL,"THIS IS A GREAT CD, AND TO THOSE PEOPLE SAYING THAT DIMEBAG HAS NO GUITAR SKILLS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE IS ONE OF THE BEST AROUND IN THE BUISNESS TODAY. THIS CD DOES HAVE SOME WEAK MOMENTS, BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME REALLY POWERFUL STUFF, THIS IS IT"
4,Extreme....,"This is the type of music I would expect from Pantera... loud, in your face, relentless metal. Some of the guitar riffs seem like they were leftovers from ""Driven"" but the album still kicks. And as for the poster who said MUNKY and HEAD are good guitartist.... look at a Pantera song and then look at a Korn song and see which one you'll figure out first. The guitarists in Korn have to be some of the worst in the industry. A guitar DOES have more than 2 strings, guys"
4,loud and hard,"I don't get some of these ""reviewers."" Yeah so Anselmo screams at the top of his lungs through most of the album. And maybe he does curse too much. But isn't that what metal is all about? And a lot of good groups like Machinehead, Korn, Slipknot, do curse a lot. Bottom line is if you don't like it, don't buy it, or go listen to ""real music"" lke rap. Rap is for people with weak ears. What a bunch of weaklings."
3,Its ok BUT.............................,"If it werent for the songs ""10's"",""13 Steps"",and ""Floods"" this album would have been Very Boring.Thats all I have to say about that."
3,hasn't clicked yet,"The bad thing is, my first attempt to listen to this album was fifteen years after it came out.One thing that hurt this album was that it came out right around the same time as Metallica-'LOAD'Not that every person that buys Met is into Pantera or vice versa but pretty close. When a band tries to compete with Met after a 5 year layoff and first album after their most popular ever it's a tough task.This album got ZERO radio play. And after listening to it once you can tell why. It's unbelievably hard. And all those great Pantera grooves appear to be gone."
3,It's ok,"My least favorite Pantera album, for a couple reasons. 1.Even fewer solos than Far Beyond Driven 2.They tried so hard to be so heavy and it didn't really work out. This is not a terrible album, as I gave it 3 stars, but Pantera has done alot better. This is worse than Far Beyond Driven, and there really aren't that many memorable songs on it. Sure it's heavy as hell, but I won't be coming back to it that much. There are some great songs though. The Great Southern Trendkill is one of the best, possibly the best on the album. Heavy as hell with a great solo. Why couldn't they do more solos? 13 steps to nowhere is an awesome song, just listen to that riff during the verse. Great drums also, Vinnie Paul is the one member of Pantera who still rules on this album. 10's and Floods are good ballads, and contain good solos. As I said, This is not a terrible album, but buy all their other albums first and then decide if you really need this one."
2,"Pantera: excellent guitars, horrible singing","Pantera really should be an instrumental band. Their singer is really really really bad. He cant even sing. He just yells at the top of his lungs throughout the whole album. However, the nails on the blackboard singing is offset by excellent guitar playing. Those are some of the best solos I've ever heard in my life. Too bad it gets ruined by a guy who sings like Celine Dion. The only song here that I can honestly say I like is Floods, mainly because it has more guitar than vocals.Thank God for Iron Maiden. They have an excellent singer to go along with their good guitarists. Long live Bruce Dickinson!"
5,Southern Trendkill,The Great Southern Trendkill is a very good cd.even harder the Fsr Beyond driven. Heavy guitar and a heavy voice.but nothing beats Vulgar Display Off Power. Still a must Buy for a pantera fan
5,"CHEAP BEER, TRENDY CLIQUES..",LESBIAN LOVE IS ACCEPTED AND RIGHT!!oh yeh! phil is god.. another great ass CD..Every song is great on here.. I feel that the best two songs are Floods and The Great Southern Trendkill.. oh yeh.. badass cd..
4,No Trend Setting To Be Found,"The Great thing about Pantera is that they always steered away from trends and selling out. They always gave the fans what they wanted. That is proof with The Great Southern Trendkill. From the very start of this album with Phil literally screaming as hard as he can into the microphone on the self titled track ""The Great Southern Trendkill"" to the almost groovy ""Drag The Waters"". Vinnie Paul is a master at drumming, just listen to ""13 Steps To Nowhere"" to hear how powerful his drumming style really is. ""Suicide Note Pt. 1"" and ""Suicide Note Pt.2"" test some new water. Part 2 is more metal but part 1 is Pantera branching out both musically and with the lyrics. ""Living Through Me"", ""Floods"", ""Sandblasted Skin"" and ""The Underground In America"" which features an awsome solo by Dimebag make The Great Southern Trendkill another great addition to any Pantera collection."
4,3.5 Stars Actually,I have got both 'Vulgar display of Power' and 'Reinventing the Steel' and this isn't very much different.Its a bit heavier but in no way is it 'death metal'. The lead singer's voice isn't all that good and sometimes he sounds like a female death metal singer (and nothing is worse than that).The riff's are good but not as good as the riffs on 'Vulgar display of Power'. This is a definate must for the Pantera diehard fans...Conclusion- decent but not brilliant (and not that heavy).
1,Ugggh..............,"This is the worst CD I ever heard. I can't stand Pantera, especially Phil Anselmo. I really don't understand how so many people love this noise. War Nerve is probably the worst metal song I have heard in a long time."
1,Fake Metal!,"This is fake metal! Just another pathetic attempt to get the Parantel Advisory label on the cover! Phil Anselmo continues to use the 'f' word non-stop! Dimebag Darrel yet plays 100 more cheezy solos to display how ""talented"" he is. If this is real metal, than it's dead!"
1,I can wait till March 21st!,"March 21 will be the day of Armageddon. Pantera's new album is coming out. And it will be just the same as Trendkill or anyother cd by this untalented band straight outta Texas. It's gonna do considerable damage to the music scene. Hopefully though, it will flop. Or better yet, Pantera will sell out. Or else, the end is near! Apocalypse is coming! Repent! Repent!"
5,DRAG THE COMPETITION SOME MORE!!!,Pantera's best album to date. Blows the doors off of popular music. Trendkill could be one of the greatest metal albums of all time.
1,not worrth the money!!!,"My dogs don't even care if it goes off, they stare at it for a minute then lay down on the couch. I have two pugs by the way. It is not that loud, it only peeps for a second maybe, then unless they move again it stays silent. Save your money and don't by this if you want to keep your pets off the furnature!"
1,Completely Ineffective,"Product was completely ineffective. Dogs were intrigued by the sound. Seemed to consider the sofa I put it on a ""giant squeak toy"". If you're trying to train your dogs to remain interested in getting on your sofas, this is the product for you.The extremely limited return policy included with the product (that's not described prior to purchase) suggests the manufacturer knows that this thing is largely useless. Essentially, if you've opened the box, installed the battery, and listened to the weak alarm sound once it's not returnable."
5,Great Product,"I have three of these devices...my dog is a very curious Border Collie who likes to jump on the couch when I'm not there...these devices deter him from doing just that. You can use these devices in your kitchen, on your bed, or anywhere you don't want your dog or cat to be. Great product and I recommend it highly. My dog is incredilby smart and sly...but when these devices go off with the slightest vibration, you better believe he high tales it off!!"
1,Doesn't bother the cats or dogs a bit.,"Well, this does emit a loud piercing sound, but only for a few seconds...long enough to make the dogs and cats look around, but as soon as they get a bit bothered, the sound quits. I think that this product might work IF it beeped longer. It was a total waste of money for me. Now I'm just passing it around the office as a prank...it's a hoot to use at work as a joke on unsuspecting coworkers."
3,Inexpensive alternative that works for some situations,"First, I have not used this pet trainer item, but the input form required me to provide a rating.I trained my dog to [mostly] stay off the sofa and also out of the trash by placing a set up mouse trap (no food involved) covered with a piece of paper on the sofa or on top of the trash. The paper is to help ensure that he won't get pinched by the trap. This has worked very well for me. He never gets in the trash any more. Occasionally he'll start getting on the sofa again, and all I need to do is start laying a piece of paper on it to keep him off.I'm now looking to keep my cat off the kitchen counter. I plan to try the idea I found here - laying out sticky tape with the sticky side up. Thanks for that tip!"
2,Not loud enough,"Not nearly loud enough to scare dogs away. Cats probably. The sensor itself works fantastic, but the buzzer is just loud enough to make my dogs more interested in it. Sounds as loud as a microwave beeping. I need something that's as loud as a firecracker going off."
2,My Cats Ain't Skeerd,"Bought this product to keep the cats off of my convertible. It sounds when they jump on the car...then they walk over , sniff it, and lay down beside it. Not exactly what I had in mind."
2,practically useless....,"wouldn't bother with this product unless you plan on having the ""offender"" jump right on top of it and knock it over. But if thats what you are going for, then it will definitely be loud enough to let you know"
5,helpful,"i put this on my kitchen sink to stop my dog from getting into it. it works wonders. now i dont even need to turn it on, its presence alone keeps my dog out of the sink. the only downfall is that if you have it on and want to turn it off, it triggers the noise"
3,So so product,"This works okay at keeping the dogs off the couch as they don't like the noise but it definitely has some drawbacks.On the more sensitive setting it goes off very easily, frequently even if I'm just walking through the living room (although admittedly I do tend to kind of stomp around the house, or at least my wife says I do). On the less sensitive setting it doesn't reliably go off when the dogs jump on the couch unless they walk very close to it.Also, the housing is very cheap and breaks in half sometimes. It can just be snapped back together but it really shouldn't do that at all as that's not the way you get at the battery or anything. Seems like very poorly made product for what they charge for it.That said, there really aren't a ton of devices I could find that do this, so unfortunately I don't know if there are any better options out there."
1,Poor manufacturing,My 2 cats destroyed 1 replacement in 3 days & they only scratch this pad occasionally!
3,Turbo Scratcher not as it used to be...,This is a refill for the cat scratcher with the ball in the gutter that goes around the cardboard insert. For whatever reason these inserts are not being glued as well as they used to be especially around the center of the core. The cats very quickly catch hold of the center and just pull it out before the scratcher has even begun to show wear. A litte extra glue would go a long way to improve this product.
4,Fans that work,"I replaced a failing Sunon fan with this and am quite happy with the purchase. While the airflow isn't quite what the Sunon had, it is adequate for my system and is fairly quiet."
3,Very Loud!,"This seems like a good fan, nothing special about it, it spins and moves air.Why is everyone saying this fan is quiet when it is screaming along at 26 dBA @ 2500 RPM? Wow! If you are looking for a quiet fan, try the SAF-B84-E1 which is 13 dBA @ 1400 RPM."
