5,Great for the serious fan,"I thought I knew about baseball before this book. I was wrong. Baseball prospectus takes abstract concepts suck as ""clutch hitting,"" and breaks them down statistically in a way that anyone can understand. This book is great for inspiring bar conversation and can help you understand the complexities of many sports."
3,Nerdy and dense but worth the effort,"Not the casual read that I expected for intermittent reading over the summer, but a balanced, thoughtful group of essays. The provocative questions that lead each chapter are more interesting reading than the actual essays which are often dry and fairly pedantic. Still, they do themselves credit with reasoned, documented arguments and analysis."
2,Not that great.,"This guy has a great voice, when he sings soft breaks in songs, exept theres only one soft break in this whole album. That could just be how the band want to sound, and thats fine, but I think if they were a bit softer they could really do well, the type of singing on this album is just a tiny bit under death metal. With so many things going on in the background the screaming vocals are kind of drowned out aswell."
2,slipped through the cracks?,another case of giant scratch blues!!! This cd came with a huge scratch on the inside of it. I get 3 songs out of it before it becomes skiptastic. Im not entirely sure why it would be sold to anyone. Did i get screwed or did it just slip through the cracks???
1,Beyond bad,"At nu-metal's height, there was a seemingly endless swarm of bands that no one had ever heard of before that just all of the sudden appeared on the scene; and every one sounded exactly the same for the most part. Factory 81 is no exception, and ""Mankind"" is far beyond uninspired, and is far beyond being worth time to anyone with a functioning brain. The lead singer sounds as if he is trying to sound like a combination of Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Robb Flynn of Machine Head, Zach de la Rocha formerly of Rage Against the Machine, and naturally Jonathan Davis of Korn. These disfigured vocals are played against a backdrop of neverending downtuned nu-metal guitars, uninspired bass work, and inconsistent drumming; a combination which is so unlistenable it makes Linkin Park look like The Who. All in all, of all the mindless nu-metal trash still floating around, this is some of the absolute worst."
5,excellent cd for an excellent nu-metal band,"wow. this is an album that has been needed in the crowded nu-metal genre. One of those cd's that you can actually listen to every song, factory 81's new release Mankind is superb. The vocals, although off in the background, are varied and melodic. Then, all of a sudden you are shooken by Nate Wallace's menacing scream, which is one of the best i've heard. His singing sounds that of Tool's big guy Maynard James Keenan, while the rapping and screaming sounds like a mix of Chino (Deftones), Zach de la Rocha (Rage), and the lead singer of Zebrahead together. This makes him sound somewhat different from other singers. The band, plays good riffs and beats, although they aren't that complex. But, that's not always the point. Especially in this case, because the songs are catchy, and get stuck in your head easily. ""Nanu"", ""Peace Officer"", and ""Diary of a Madman"" are among the great songs of the cd. Check these guys out, and see them live if you get the chance."
2,Grows tiresome,"Factory 81 always seemed to be on the brink of being something really special but never quite made it. Mankind is a fairly obvious testament to the shortcomings of the band. Namely, track for track, the album all sounds pretty much the same. From slightly awkward rap-metal to droning grindcore, Mankind is one of the most difficult CDs to listen to from beginning to end. It starts out strong with ""Nanu"" but gradually loses momentum as the barrage of uninspired riffs and melodies grow increasingly mundane. With obvious debt to bands such as Tool and Deftones, Factory 81 rarely rise to a level above third-rate rap-metal.Mankind could be pared down to make a killer E.P., but as a full-length release it's simply boring."
5,IF YOU LIKE CRAZY.....,"this band reminds me alllllllllllllllot of the very first korn. there is so much energy in the lead singers voice, it feels like he's letting out feelings that have been bottled up for years(one of the BEST screams i've ever heard, which is very important). and the fact that he sings about everyday struggles, such as cops , easily relates to EVERYONE, and i often find myself driving down the road, blasting, and yelling along with him. {I just have to say this is the best cd i've bought in a while. c/l music online .. tryout..nanu and 6 oclock love letter.. 2 awesome tracks} IF YOU LIKE THE OLD SCHOOL KORN, THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT CD FOR YOU!!!!!!! IT JUST ROCKS LOUD, HARD, AND CRAZY, BUY IT!!"
5,...,"I originally picked up this CD almost a year ago, before they got signed to Mojo. This album is amazing. Similarities to Taproot come up a lot, probably because both bands honed their sounds together in Michigan. Obviously, Taproot is getting noticed more for being on Ozzfest, but factory 81 can tear it up just as good if not better. This album has a remix version of one song, which was not available on the original album. Factory 81 can be compared to RATM, Machine Head, as well as many others, but just take them for what they are: great intense metal. Yeah, it's part of the new generation of metal, but definitely worth the money."
4,Want metal? Get Factory 81 . . .,"From the first tapping of the cymbal on the single ""nanu"" i was intrigued by this group. I heard the single at a concert between sets. This song was more popular with the crowd than the headliner. The crowd fed off of it. if you want something that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, then this is the cd. With songs like ""nanu"" and ""Peace Officer"" to start you off on a anger-filled ride full of tweaked out bass lines and the screaming of Nate Wallace. Songs like ""3 o Clock Love Letter"" and ""Rotten Strawberries"" put you into a melodic trance. Overall the best cd i have bought since the ""Full devil Jacket"" and ""Linkin Park Debuts."""
5,"Angry, talented, and political","This is the angriest album I have ever heard. It is like a really well done mixture of Deftones and Rage Against the Machine, WITHOUT the garbage rap metal style that Rage has. Very good."
4,AWESOME,"This cd is real good. You can tell that the band must like Tool and RATM, because that is who they sound a lot like. A mix of the 2, and a little spin on it that sounds real good. I am not a big fan of the whole ""new metal"" movement, but I do know good music, and this is just that. I can't help but think this is how the Taproot cd should have sounded...."
5,hard to find,i looked all over for this.the copy i had was recorded over.great price.i'm glad that amazon carries vhs tapes.they are getting harder and harder to find.
1,Still waiting,I am still waiting to receive this book. I had to go and purchase this at Barnes and nobles. I don't knOw what happened.
5,Awesome Movie,"This is a classic war movie, it depicts a russian tank crew lost in Afghanistan, during the occupation of that country by the russians.Graphic violance, and some disturbing scene's are throughout this movie.Great movie, everyone should watch it."
2,MORE WAR IS HELL,"Unfortunately, in spite of the excellent reviews this movie has received on Amazon's site, I found it dull, tedious, and ultimately boring. Having the Russians speak English but using subtitles for the Afghans was a meaningless ploy to me. The cast did well with their roles, but at times the sound was so low, I couldn't understand what the Russians were saying and I got tired of reading the contrived subtitles. Not my cup of tea, I guess."
5,A Classic no B.S. look at the soviet-afghan war,"You must watch this if you have never seen it before. This is a little known, no B.S. look at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 80's. Made during that period, it wasn't very popular, but is a must see if you want to know what it's like to REALLY go to war on a tank........NEVER get off the tank!I'm buying a copy because I loaned mine to somebody who never brought it back-that means it was a good movie i guess?"
5,Echos from the Soviet Empire,"The video ""The Beast"" tells a soldier's story from the old Evil Empire during the final days of the Cold War. Our soldier is a Soviet Tank Driver who takes part in a raid on an Afghan Village. Far from winning over ""Hearts & Minds"" of the Afghan villagers the Soviets are inderested in literally crushing resistance. Our tank driver does not fit in with the tank commander's ideal of how a Soviet soldier should behave. The Tank commander is a Stalingrad veteran who is definately Old School Soviet.The tank becomes lost after a raid on an Afghan village and is hunted by a group of Mujahadeen seeking revenge.This movie is a great dipiction of the Soviet military and Afghan culture. I recommend this movie to all military history buffs."
5,Is my husband gift for christmas,"He already saw it, and he loves it because the tanks that show, his hobby is modeling tanksof the WWII. In the movie you can see some of them. Its a good movie for this subject."
3,Great Movie - But a warning about the DVD,"This is great, underrated war film. But a warning about this DVD edition. The package states that the disc contains both full and widescreen versions of the film. However, when my copy arrived, it contained a single sided DVD with only the full screen version. This isn't Amazon's fault, as I'm sure they based their listing on the package info. So be advised, you won't be getting the widescreen version."
4,great movie this was,this movie was great and it was good condition dvd disc and came with the dvd case for it that.
3,Das Boot with a tank!,"A timely, yet flawed movie about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. You can experience the claustrophobia of being in a tank during the harsh Afghan climate changes, but I still can't get over the fact that the Russian soldiers spoke American English, actually with a bit of Bronx accents thrown in here and there! But definintly worth a rental, or cheap purchase."
1,This card adapter doesn't work with my HP printer,"I purchased my Fuji CompactFlash xD Card Adapter elsewhere and it doesn't work in my HP officejet 7130 all-in-one. It won't load in as it's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards. Except then I get an amber light that says there is a card error. This is supposed to work with my all-in-one but it doesn't. For that reason, I'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed. I'm going to take this CP version back and hope the more updated CPF version works. I'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles, but I'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly. This one is definitely a thumbs down. However, this is my first dud Fuji product I've bought and I love Fuji digital cameras."
2,not thrilled,"I hAVE BEEN A FAN OF ENGLEBERT'S FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I PURCHASED THIS ALBUM BECAUSE HE WAS SINGING SOME OF MY FAVORITES THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD HIM SING BEFORE. THE PROBLEM WITH THE ALBUM IS THAT HE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT PUT HIS HEART INTO A SINGLE SONG. COMPARE IT TO ""RELEASE ME"" AND YOU WILL FIND THE ALBUM BORING FROM ALMOST START TO FINISH."
3,Smoother Shave..,"Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave Original, 3 fl oz, definately makes an annoying choir a little easier. I've never been a huge fan of electric razors, because I haven't found any brand that gives me as good a shave as I get from even a cheap blade. Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor. Williams Lectric Shave allows me to get a smoother shave when using an electric, but its smell, while not offensive, is almost overpowering.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
3,"Not a bad product, just bad bottling",This is product should come in a spray applacation so it can be applyed on the face easier. When put on hands it runs down my arms and when applyed on face your pushing the hair down with your hands so that is defeating the purpose of the product intentions. It would be less messy as well.
5,Williams Lectric Shave,It's a good way to lube your Face befor you use your Electric Shaver.It Mosturizes your Face. Keeps your Face Feeling... Good.
2,Small for the Price,I thought it would be a great deal online but the bottle is half the size I get at the store for the same price. Buyer beware!
3,goodproduct..,I have to place a order for it on line. I had given up on razor blades because regardless of the razors I still get razor burn. With electric shave that all goes away. I get lots of compliments on how good my skin looks.
3,Getting too expensive.,"Have used Lectric Shave for 45 years. Formulation and aroma has been the same as always. It's a good product but is now over priced. In today's economy, three bucks for 7 oz is about right. I get really tired of seeing 10-15% hikes every time I buy it. By contrast, Gillette products have been rising about 5% during the same time periods. P&G, while never cheap could introduce a good competitor for around 3 bucks. I'm sure some corporation will rise to compete at nearly 6 bucks for 7oz."
3,Small Bottles! 3 oz,"Beware, these are smaller size bottles. Pharmacies usually carry 6oz bottles and these are only 3oz."
5,7.5 Hours of Live Grateful Dead Concert Video,"I had originally wanted the long-awaited release from the Grateful Dead Video Vault - View From the Vault. I was at the Louisville, KY show and the Pittsburgh show, and was interested in having View From the Vault on video. Then, I discovered the DVD boxed set that is known as Live Dead the Grateful Dead in Concert. What accompanies the 1990 Pittsburgh show are 2 previously released video gems, Downhill from Here (1989 Alpine Valley) and Ticket to New Years (1987 Oakland Coliseum). There is no better way to immediately amass a Grateful Dead concert video collection. The video quality is scary, it's like having 5th row seats at each show. Definately recommended to fans and those that wish they'd have seen the Dead live."
3,Not Their Best Effort,"Well, This is the first dvd I bought for my first dvd machine. I excitedly read glowing reviews on this very site for the set. The View from the Vault is fantastic in both picture and sound quality; seriously top notch. The actual show is a different story. Weak versions of everything. It seems as if Jerry just didn't have it together that night. Downhill From Here provides a better effort from the boys, but inferior video (it looks blurry) and audio (not as crisp). Ticket to New Year's I owned on vhs and also features less video clarity, but has the best set list and by far the best actual 'playing' from the band. The 'extras' or special functions on the discs are negligible at best. As a true fan and show veteran, it's cool to own these to get a taste of the good ol' days, but not the audio/visual masterpiece you'd most like to have."
2,Fastener broke in a couple of month,"It works fixing garden host, but the fastener on the first one I use broke in a couple of month. I lost tons of water as a result"
1,Bratz are BAD news,"I think that these Bratz things are so dumb. They dress very inappropriately and I think having boy ones are over the line. Little girls are playing with these prtending like they are grow up divas. Children already grow up too fast why make it go faster with toys like these that encurage it more, not to mention they promote dressing inappropriately and liking boys at a young age. Let little girls stay little girls while they can, don't buy this."
2,Not worth the money,"This disco was a big disappointment! It is so cheaply made yet so expensive to buy. My sister in law and I put it together on Christmas eve for my 8 year old daughter. My sister in law could not believe how much I paid for this toy because it is so not worth the money. It also does not work that well. The dolls usually fall off the moving runway and there are so many little pieces and only one little drawer to fit it all into. Also, the dolls are unable to sit on the chairs. My daughter was excited to get this toy but after playing with it for a little while she told me that it looked much funner on tv. I forgot to mention that it falls apart if moved so make sure you have it where you want it before you start playing with it. Don't make the mistake I did, don't buy this toy! Your child may think that she wants it but once she gets it and TRIES to play with it she won't be as intrigued as she should be for a toy you spent [this much] on."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We had all of the problems the other reviewers listed with the toy falling apart etc. My daughter is 5 and she just did not even show any interest in all the little pieces because there were just so many. In addition the limo radio would not play when hooked up to the runway. Even if everything worked I think it was just too detailed for her and the recommended age should be moved up to 7 or 8. The only bright spot in the whole thing is that Toys R Us took it back even though we did not still have the box. So she got a wooden doll house and some bratz furniture and she is now happy!
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This is the WORST toy ever! My 6 yr old received this toy for Christmas 2003. What a joke. It is cheaply constructed and falls apart very easily. The doll doesn't stay on the motorized runway for more than 5 seconds. Speaking of motorized runway, its loud and sounds like its dying. What a disappointment! For $100, you'd think it came with some kind of music. They actually have the nerve to give you a little cord to hook up to your own radio. And the cord is not even long enough! Save your money, your daughter(s) will only be disappointed! Back it goes."
4,Mixed emotions,"I got the Bratz Disco against my better judgment for my 4 1/2 year old. She wanted it so bad that I finally caved and got it for her on Christmas Eve. She loves the toy but it really can not be moved, when you go to move it, it all falls apart. For [the money] you would think it would be a little better constructed. I also think it should have its own music instead of having to spend [more money]on the Limo, which my daughter already wants for her birthday in March. Bottom line is that she loves it. The lights, the moving stage and all of the accessories keep her interest she really loves it. If you keep it in one place, I think it will be OK. But it is big and bulky if you do not have a lot of room in your child's bedroom I do not recommend."
5,GREAT TOY!,"I recieved this toy for Christmas and it is very fun! You can hook up a cd player, stereo, or even the FM Limo to the runway and it will play music. You will have so much fun making the dolls go up and down the runway with the lights blinking. It comes with so many accessories! From bushes, to compacts, to soda bottles, it has accessories that will make the playset even more fun. It also comes with a new doll, Nevra, who is positivly gorgeous. This is a great toy for any Bratz lover."
5,BRATZ RUNWAY RULES!,"Don't listen to the other reviewers. I recieved the Bratz Runway, the limo and other Bratz stuff for Christmas. It is durable. The runway is awesome and it does stay together. The runway works and so does the lights. A must have toy! Parents: Any girl would love this set. It does work and is pretty durable."
1,junk,Have bratz spa and salon. Plastic junk. Never play with it. Falls apart when finally put together. Toooo many small pieces. Can't move it after put together. Hard to keep dolls in chairs. I am sure runway disco is the same. Way over priced at 50.00.
5,Get the toy nowwwwwwwwww. Why?,You should get the RUN-WAY DISCO because it's fun to play with and if you really wanted the disco you shouldn't get tired of it because i know i'm not. I still driving my mom crazy beacuse I love It so much why should I get tired of it. It come with 50-67 pieces and any girl that want it should keep begging their parents. 5 reason why u should get it......1) It has alot of pieces2) It's worthy for ever thing the disco have.3)The price went down because didn't u parents say I'll get it when the price goes down. Yes4) The disco has real music.5) Last u won't have to worry about your children crying anymore.p.s crying just for the run-way disco
5,IT ROX!!!! TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!,I MEAN LOOK AT HER FROM HER HEAD TO HER TOES SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE BYONCI AND FROM HER NOSE TO HER TOES SHE IS OUTSTANDING!!!!I GIVE THIS 5 STARS!!!!
3,Bad Choice,"My 6-Year old cousin had this toy. Whenever I go over to her house, we always play with it. It always breaks and everything falls over. It's not made good at all. Just get more Bratz with the converible car instead."
1,Worst gift ever,"My daughter, age 9, wanted this for Christmas, so Santa got it for her. Christmas afternoon turned out to be an episode in frustration as the doll would not stay on the track, the runway lights no longer worked, and every flimsy piece kept falling apart. Finally, after a few changes of new batteries (the compartment, by the way, is located on the bottom of the platform so that a battery change requires dismantling the whole thing) my daughter said, ""Dad, let's return it"" and so we did and Amazon refunded the money. I took her out a couple days later and bought a guitar which she is happy with.. Hopefully, your experience will be better, but for [the price] this is the most overpriced piece of junk yet."
2,WHAT?,WHY ARE THE PRICES FOR BRATZ MERCHANDISE SO HIGH?? It's ridiculous to pay so much for something so small!! And 9 dolls together for $300?! What were they thinking?
5,This toy is awesom!,Hi I have this toy because it's very fun. I also like that it comes with a lot of acceries. It's very fun and for anybody who loves Bratz I would recommend this.
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,I bought this for my Daughter against my better judgement. I should have learned from the Brats Spa. Very expensive for plastic garbage. They just came out with the Sunkissed Bratz pool. I will not waste my money. Please use your money more wisely then I did. My Daughter played with the item once. Junk!!!!
2,it REKS !!!!!!,"I got this toy for Xmas, everytime I set it up it falls down. Sometimes I get so mad that I feel like tearing IT down !!!"
3,Stylin Disco?,"The toy is great fun, but not spectacular. It does come with tons of accessoriesI had no trouble putting it together and I find it very durable. The best part is when you put the dolls on the runway and they do a little twirl. Way cute."
4,my daughter is very happy with the product and I also am.,"I have read many of the reviews and I have to say i am very happy with this toy and my daughter plays with it all the time. It is a little easy to come apart, but this is made for a child. I have her take it apart and put it together each time she wants to play and it teaches her responsibity. This saves space in her room and she can play anywhere she wants to at the moment, she is not stuck only playing in a certain part of the house. She has a good time setting this up and playing for hours, I feel it was worth the money and getting the Limo was a added bonus. I will be buying more of the pieces and the dolls. I would say this is a very good choice for your child to own, it just takes patience and imagination, something all children have, some of us adult may need more of these."
4,The Bratz can boogie down....sort of...,"We don't have the FM Limo so my daughter hooked it up to her walkman and played CDs on it. The sound was kind of choppy. The Bratz fall off the runway very easily. It's cute when it works with the dolls turning at the corners of the runway. I thought it would have more lights on it. This was the #1 toy on my daughter's Xmas list and she was thrilled to get it. If your expectations are realistic about this plastic toy with battery-operated moving parts and tiny speakers, it's OK."
5,SOOOOOOOOOOCOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It is so fun! Its the best x-mas present yet! I dont have it, but still its so awsome. Hey kids! Beg your parents for this. (Is better than you think!)"
1,Expensive Runway Disco from MGA,"I do not own this thing, but I HAVE seen it in stores and it is way too pricy. I curently am not happy with the MGA company, and now I am even more unhappy! It is too much money for one toy! There are other expensive toys that exist, but they are WORTH IT and are GOOD QUALITY TOYS! It is not fair to the makers of these toys that all of the Bratz stuff is practically flying OFF THE SHELVES! Never buy a Bratz doll- EVEN IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!"
2,Bratz runway Playset,This toy is a great toy for a young girl. There are four dolls that you can play with it.
3,Frustrating,"Very difficult to keep the doll on the runway. My daughter was very excited to get it all put together only to be frustrated when the doll kept falling off. Also, since the piece that holds the doll on the runway is clear plastic, it was difficult to keep track of it. It should be made of black plastic."
5,bratz' biggest fan,i don't have this bratz and runway disco but i might get it for a present.i think this is a great gift for any bratz lover.i have have 7 bratz but i think this is the best one iv'e ever seen.her outfit is so pretty.the runway disco is also so cool.her makeup is so beautiful and so is the coat.she comes with:1 shirt1 pair of pants2 pairs of boots1 coat1 purse1 hatand tonz of acssesoriesi hope this helped you.thankz for looking.
2,This toy falls apart when you put it together,"Bratz has some great designs, and boy was this item priced right when I saw it on sale...but much like the other Bratz products that require assembly, I was very disappointed when the parts did not stay together and kept on falling apart. Until the company puts more time and effort into engineering their products better so that they actually stay together, save your money and don't buy any Bratz plastic products that require assembly. I'm an avid Bratz collector and I've assembled many of their products, and I've had to take almost all of them back. Save your money and buy something that will stay together like Legos."
2,Bratz runway...,"I bought the Bratz runway at an auction for less than retail, thank goodness! The toy we got (new and sealed in the package), while nice concept and cute and all, just doesn't stay together very well. Pieces that were supposed to snap together - didn't! - and came apart/fell over while play was in progress."
1,Very cheaply made - Everything falls apart,My child received this toy for Christmas last year. The dolls will not stay on the runway. The toy will not stay together. There is always something falling off. I e-mailed the company about how cheap this product was and they told me to return it in the original package. The package was thrown away on Christmas morning. They told me there wasn't anything they could do. My daughter was very disappointed in the toy and became when the toy kept started falling apart. It is not in peices in her closet.
3,bratz disco,Yes...pieces are always coming apart but my daughter still loves it. After you build the disco just whatever you do DO not bang into it! Otherwise the pieces will easily come apart. If you balance the dolls just right on the runway they will stay on and spin around and go in circles. Its a fun toy and has been worth the money for me.
4,BRATZ DISCO DISAPPOINTMENT,"My mother bought this for my daughter for Christmas based onreviews I had read. I was immediately excited to see all the detail and accessories that came with it. That changed pretty quickly as I started to assemble it.The pieces do not fit together well at all.When assembleing the speakers the rightside of the stage when it is facing you does not fit togetherproperly.On close inspection one can see that the grooves for thesections to slide together are not carved correctly. So it keeps falling apart.I called the company as requested in the instructions and asked them to send me new speakers that fit properply. I was assured they would get back to me in 48 hoursand it has been a week and noone has called.Needless to say I am very disappointed in the manufacturing of this item. By the way Iam in product developement and engineering - not a novice at thisas some reviewers claim when they read about problems in assembly.it is a great concept ,but poor design."
3,[just finished putting this together],"I just finished putting the disco together and was also disappointed with the flimsyness, etc. etc..."
3,Too many small pieces,"I like the Bratz and find it nice to see Barbie get some compition however the pieces to these dolls are so much smaller than Barbie pieces. This runway is hard to store when not being played with. I bumped it with my foot while putting other things away and it fell apart (it didn't break) and had to be reassembled which is a pain. Other than that my daughter enjoys it. I, as a mom, think it is a pain."
5,An inspiring and entertaining book.,"A very inspiring and fun read! Written by a couple who had the courage to pursue their dreams, this book is written for you and me with lots of details, wit and humor.One of the funnest books I have read in years."
2,"Disappointing (the video, not the music!)","This DVD is definitely ""old school"". Compared to other children's videos of today, it looks amateurish and low-budget. The film is grainy, and it is definitely dated (see the clothing and glasses worn by the audience!). We LOVE Raffi at our house, but my 2-yr-old daughter won't be bothered to watch this--I guess she finds it boring. A lot of other reviews refer to it as a ""CD"" (listening to it in the car, etc.) and sound as if they are reviewing ""Singable Songs"" the CD, which IS great--no argument there. THIS IS JUST A BORING VIDEO of an amazing singer. It was a waste of money for us--I should have just used the money to buy another of his CDs."
5,Timeless,"I had this in VHS version many years ago when my first 2 children were infants/toddlers. They LOVED it! My son and daughter would watch it in full without moving--other than dancing. I will say, however, that some kids don't get into it. My nephew would lose interest in just a few minutes. I am ordering it today for my 5 month old... I cant wait to start playing it. It will bring back good memories for all of us"
5,All 5 of my Children Have Loved It!,"Forget all the hyped-up, fast-moving children's entertainment out there.... It takes a very special talent to entertain children these days, especially with a simple guitar on an otherwise empty stage, and Raffi has it in spades! This man's love for children is entrancing, and he has had an endearing effect on all 5 of my own. If I could recommend ANY video for children in the vast world of entertainment today, it would be this pure and simple stage performance. This one has staying power! My family has loved it for years!"
4,"came fast, 2 dishes, came w lots of instructions & silicone","Our bath remodel is going slow so it will be a long time before these get installed. The vendor shipped these VERY quickly and well packaged. I was pleased to realize I got 2 little soap dishes - they are about 4 inches on a side - was only expecting one, and didn't expect to get a full set of instructions AND a tube of the proper silicone adhesive - NOW I understand the price better and I'm very pleased. It will be nice to have places for his n her soaps. They are well made and the side supports provide a pretty wide area for the adhesive to attach. Its hard to tell that from the pictures and description. I think we'll like them when the whole thing is done. Now when can we get the plumber in to hook up the shower?........"
5,Scary!,"The Mist is one of King's scariest novels. Not a very satisfying ending, but leaves the reader with lots to think about."
5,Spooky....,"Keeps you reading and lets you know that most anything and everything to do with weird happenings are connected to outside sources when it comes to flying monsters and green mists. It seems the government is at it again. The actors in the movie are great and the book superb. Again, a King skill."
2,Alfred Hitchcock Ending,"While I have enjoyed many Stephen King books and movies over the years I could not get interested in The Mist. I kept reading - it is, after all, short, so it didn't take much time. But after reading to the end only to have an Alfred Hitchcock non-ending, I was really disappointed. The fact he even warns you in the final pages it will be what his (the main character) dad called a ""conclusion in ambiguity"" or a 'cheap shot' ending, makes it an even bigger slap in the face. The cop out excuse is the reader/listener/watcher is to use their own imagination but that is the whole point of TV, Movies, Books - we are paying the author to give us a story with a beginning, a middle and an ending. If the author can not complete his work and instead leaves it to me, then I should skip his work and do my own - AND I'd the one getting paid.It is one of my pet peeves when an author doesn't give us an ending. Bad, good, sad, happily ever after, give me some sort of an ending."
1,I wish I could get my money back,I was disappointed with this CD.I was expecting the reading of a short story (only 1 CD) with special effects from the 3d sound. What I got was a poorly executed radio play where the sound effects blast at high volume and the dialogue is so low and mumbled I had to keep turning the volume up to maximum.I have a lot of Kings Books (both audio and hardcover) and like the way the characters develop as the story moves along.In this audio adaptation of Kings Story none of the characters flesh out. They all remain flat and uninteresting.Save your money and read the book or wait for the movie.
1,Radio Play,"I was impressed with the audio that goes with this adaptation of the book. I know it's listed as an audio book, this is no audio book. It's more to the point of being like one of those old days radio plays instead. It's deffantly not by the book. I'm glad I bought the book because I would of missed out on a ton of stuff that this so called audio book left out."
1,Sound leaves much to be desired,"Ten minutes into the book, I gave up. There is SO MUCH background noise that you have to turn your volume way up to hear the conversation, while the background noise SCREAMS in your ear. They should've gotten a ""professional"" to read the kid's part. I was not impressed!"
1,Totally commercial,"Some of the story managed to get in between the shameless mentioning of name brand products, mostly food items. (It takes place in a grocery store)I would give it zero stars, if it was possible. Save your money."
3,And Knowing is half the battle,"I've been thinking about this 3-D audiobook/dramtization quite a bit, since I first heard about the movie. I owned the audiocassette version back in the mid-80s, and I assumed it was out of print. Well, you know what happens when you assume. I remember being more impressed with the ambition behind the production than the actual production (having always been a fan of old time radio drama, especially Suspense/The Whistle and similar scary anthologies). Still, while some of the performances were lacking, there were still many elements of the production that were really effective, and it's definitely worth a listen. It's something I'll be adding to my Christmas Wish List.Oh, and according to imdb.com, the actor who played David in this dramatization is William Sadler, who costars in the Frank Darabont movie as nonbeliever-turned-true believer-turned scared-witless-born-again-drone Jim Grondin. So now you know..."
2,Very poor quality,"I just finished listening to this audiobook and was extremely disappointed. The quality of the audio was just plain awful. I constantly had to keep adjusting the volume up and down. One minute the effects and music are blasting me out, the next, dialog is being delivered that is so low that even at max volume I can't make out what is being said. Some times the actors sound like they are talking from the bottom of a coffee can and sometimes they are clear and distinct. At other times the actors sound like they are 50 feet from the microphone talking to someone who is standing right next to the microphone. You can hear part of the conversation and can only guess about the other half. Don't even get me started on the kid. That's another story all together.All in all, the story seems pretty good, but the delivery of the story and the low production values just drug it down. If you can listen to it free, I would recommend it, if you have to pay for it, take a pass."
3,Matter of opinion.,"The Mist in 3D sound obviously has a lot of great sound effects. A good story line. It all depends how loud you crank up the volume as to how scared you get. The louder it is the more you are likly to jump. Some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. And although some of the actors/actresses really try, you really have to try hard, use your imagination to really see in your own mind what is happening. The people are stuck in a super market, so when you think about it, there is only so much you can do. You cant go very far. You can eat yeah...but thats is. As the story progresses you expect a terrifying climax in true King style. I, however, felt let down. But I leave it up to you. Personally, I prefered the book. But this is nice for a change. Give it a try and see what you think. Remember that this is only my opinion. I am a King fan but I'm also honest...my email if you'd like to get in touch...belfastbadboy@hotmail.com"
1,The Disapointment,"I realize that Stephen King is one of the most esteemed writers of our generation, but you couldn't prove it by this 'book' (actually a short story lifted from a book of collected stories). To say that this novella is wordy is an understatement. It takes a full 1/4 of the book to get the story going and when it finally gets underway, the action/scary parts are relatively few and far between, and the ending, well, isn't really an ending but more like Mr. King simply got bored and walked away. I'm a huge fan of Mr. King and I thought the premise of the book to be really interesting but it just is not up to par with some of his other works that he has put more thought and interest into. As a short story (which should be offered for 99 cents), I would recommend it as something to pass the time, but put out as a book (for $6.99), you should give The Mist a Miss!"
5,Very good book,I can't believe this book was just like the movie. Different ending then the movie. Great book can't put it down.
5,A Must Own,"This is what audiobooks should sound like, and the perfect story for it. Put on your headphones and turn off the light and you're right in the middle of the story. The sound effects will make you jump, and even the music score keeps the tension going. You got to hear this one."
2,Don't purchase if you intend to listen in your car,"I recently rented this audiobook from the library on cd, and although the story itself is pretty good, the audio kills the book. The disc starts off discussing the whole 3D quality audio which seems like a neat feature, but for some reason it doesn't adapt well in the car. I found myself having to turn up the audio to hear the characters only to suddenly need to turn it down so I didn't lose my hearing from the sudden scary stuff in the story. Because of this, I just found it hard to truly follow the dialogue and after listening to about half of it and still being confused about what's going on, I don't want to finish it. Listening to this just makes you either want to see the movie, or just sit down and read the book so you can understand it better."
3,"Great Buildup, Weak Ending","The Mist grabbed and held my attention for the first 90% of the story. While Stephen King is truly a first class American writer, it seems to me that his endings can be somewhat weak and predictable (some will view this comment as blasphemy). In this instance, there was a wonderful buildup that culminated in something along the lines of ""...and then we left."" Little was explained, since the story is a first person account from a person who had no idea what was happening. In the final analysis, I enjoyed The Mist, but felt let down when I finished."
5,great book,This book was great and kept me wanting more. Def worth the read and made me watch the movie afterwards.
2,Formulaic and lame,"As a person who purchases over $800 worth of audio products each year I can say I have some experience in regards to audiobooks. As far as production goes this book is pretty good. The sound effects are nicely done and some of the actors play their roll well. Waht fails for me is the story. I mean folks its been done before over and over and over and over again. Of course there is the added annoyance of the kid's voice and that one cheap sexual encounter. Add the abrupt ending and what do you have left? An audiobook full of great sound and sound effects and nothing much else. If you want something a bit more better, try the audio play version of Pet sematary done by the BBC; that one is much better and a whole lot more scarier then this mess. My copy ended up in the garbage after all."
4,Best With Headphones,"The sound on this CD is wonderful, especially with headphones as that is what it was designed for. The little boy gets kind of annoying (he sounds as if his tongue has swollen past the capacity of his mouth) and the constant descriptions sometimes sound like the characters are selling the product. (""well we've got skippy super crunch or..."") But if they didn't describe these things we wouldn't know what they were doing, eating, drinking, running away from, etc. Anyways, this tells the story of a town caught in the grip of an unusual mist that rolled in of the lake on a warm day, after an unusual storm the night before. Perfect for an hour drive or an evening alone with the headphones, even better if at night."
4,for those complaining about the audio quality...,it is a binaural recording. basically it is a recording technique that was meant specifically to be listened to with headphones. when played through a home or car system the stereo image completely collapses and sounds terrible. listen to it through a set of phones and I think you'll have a dramatically different opinion of the sound quality.
3,Not what I thought.,"I like to listen to audio books and follow along in the book at the same time. I couldn't do that with this CD. The story is good just the same, but it wasn't like ""normal"" audio books. It didn't ""read"" the story. To me it was like hearing a movie that I couldn't see. Not a terrible thing, but it wasn't what I thought."
2,"Story good, execution...bad",This audio production turned out to be difficult to listen to because of the overpowering use of sound effects. The voice quality in the story was poor also; had to keep turning it up to hear what was being spoken and then quickly turning it down when the sound effects came crashing back. The story is good but the execution of it in the audio version was disappointing.
3,A Beginning,"This 3D audio endeavor has great intentions. However, the story lost much in the audio presentation. I had to turn my volume almost up to max to hear some of the dialogue. Two or more characters often speak at the same time, making it difficult to distinguish the dialogue. However, I applaud Stephen King for his efforts to make us ""books-on-tape"" fans happy. It was a bold effort...a beginning in this medium that can be looked at as a building block for future audio books. If I was looking to get the most out of this story, I'd read the printed word."
2,A Great Short Story Turned to Trash,"I loved this short story when I read it, but this so-called ""3-D"" version of the story on audio tape cut out essential scenes, sounds cheap, and was poorly cast. If you liked the story or if you like Stephen King at all, don't punish yourself with this audio book."
1,eh...,"I listened to this audiobook in a hotel room in the dark by myself and was bored. It's very short, anti-climactic, and very rushed. I didn't feel any emotion with any of the characters or their storylines. It sounded like a reading done in a high school english class with a cheesy sound effects board. I am a giant Stephen King fan, but this wasn't worth the cd it was burned on...Read the Dark Tower series, or buy audiobooks that are read by Stephen himself...Don;t waste your time with this..."
2,"Stephen King Fan, Greatly disappointed.","Imagine my suprise when I found ""The Mist"" on Amazon.com, I have been looking for this recording for years. I ordered it immediately. I got it today and couldn't wait to sit down and listen to it. Though the 3-D sound was incredible the story lacked substance and seemed to jump all over the place. In one part a man is trapped in a store with his son, his wife is at home miles away and probably dead, so he decides to sleep with another woman. What this had to do with the story or the plot is beyond me.Don't get me wrong, I've been a Stephen King fan since I first started reading thrillers, you could even say that he is my favorite writer. But, ""The Mist"" is nothing like anything by Mr. King that I have ever heard before. I was disappointed.Maybe it was the medium used to deliver the story that disappointed me? If it were in book form I might have been able to ""crawl into"" or ""become part"" of the story and then I may h! ave enjoyed it."
2,"Great Story, Horrible ""3-D""","I read the story awhile ago and decided to get some CD's to listen to on my drive to work. This is not an actual reading of the book, but more of a radio drama. I have no problem with that, but the audio mixing is horrible. The music is sometimes too loud and I could no understand the dialog. The little boy does a terrible reading and has a very minor speech problem that makes him difficult to listen to. I found it to be a very annoying CD to listen to."
4,Mistifying,Enjoyed this little book. It wasn't scary or creepy though. King did not stray from who he is and what makes his stories stick. I wish we knew more at the ending...
4,I thought it was good.....,"I am a big fan of Stephen King. However I did not know that this was a novella and that it was also published in skeleton crew~ Anyway, very good!!!! I liked the fast pace. I was a little worried when I got the book since it is only about 100+ pages, I thought oh this is going to stink. However, I totally got into it and was able to put myself in that position and totally freaked myself out! LOL~ I cannot wait until the movie comes out on DVD... Loved the ending as well~ VERY CREEPY!!!!!"
5,Great atmospheric(no pun intended) horror story!,I would rank this audio book as one of the best produced that I have heard. The 3d sound is amazing and the acting is superb. You feel a palapble sense of impending doom and horror as the story enfolds. A simple straightforward horror story done in a very entertaining way.
4,"The Mist, a quick little horror story","I hadn't read a lot of Stephen King for awhile. I loved his earlier work, but wasn't crazy about his later books. After buying the Mist, I found it was from his short story book, ""The Skeleton Crew"", which I have but never read. Oh well. Anyway, I really enjoyed the story, it's characters, and the ending. I'll be reading the rest of The Skeleton Crew now."
2,Chris,"It may be very different if you listen to the CD through head phones, but it is hard to listen to it in your car. When you listen to it in your car there are characters that scream in your ear while they talk and others you cannot here (because of the special audio mix). Also, did they review this CD before they released it? The child actor is just reading his lines, he does not act like the others. I thought the story was ok, but they should have left you with an ending. I would say it was worth about less than half of what I paid for it."
3,Good for listening on a stormy night!,"I've had this CD for years and it is wonderful to listen to with earphones on because it really does make you feel like you are in the middle of the story. My sons were in high school when I asked my oldest one to listen one evening. My headphones didn't allow him to get far from the player, so he sat in the middle of the room in the rocker. The only lights on were in the family room, and he kept looking over his shoulder out into the dark hallway, totally spooked. He was totally hooked on King after listening to this.My only complaint about this radio play was the child who sounded like he was reading his lines and not doing it well. The adult actors and the sound effects people did a great job! I'd recommend this to all King fans."
1,What I think of the Mist,"This is the worst book on tape I have ever listened to! I am an avid Stephen King fan, and I loved this story when I read it. I also listen to many books on tape (probably 3 per month) on my drive to work, and I like them also. However, this one was difficult to finish. There were way too many things going on at once. Too many voices, too many extra sounds, too much loud music for the effect. I wasn't able to understand almost half of what they were saying. This would be much more effective if one person read the story, right from the book."
2,"Stephen King Fan, greatly disappointed.","Imagine my suprise when I found ""The Mist"" on Amazon.com, I have been looking for this recording for years. I ordered it immediately. I got it today and couldn't wait to sit down and listen to it. Though the 3-D sound was incredible the story lacked substance and seemed to jump all over the place.

2,Disappointing,"This story certainly has it's creepy moments, but unfortunately it provides no resolutions at all, nor any explanations for the things that happen. I'm all for ambiguous endings, but this one felt like the author just ran out of steam and wasn't sure how to end the story...or how to explain what had happened. Also, most of the characters are unlikeable and hard to root for. Particularly the main character who often has his 6-year-old fetching beer for him. I'm a Stephen King fan, but the lack of follow through on this one ultimately made for a dissatisfying read."
1,Not impressed!,"Ten minutes into the book, I gave up. There is SO MUCH background noise that you have to turn your volume way up to hear the conversation, while the background noise SCREAMS in your ear. They should've gotten a ""professional"" to read the kid's part. I was not impressed!"
2,Dreadful,"The 3-D sound is a great concept, but it fails in this adaptation. The dialog is pretty unnatural in many places and the acting sounds like bad community theater. Other reviewers are correct when they say that the sound effects and music get too loud, especially when competing with the overlapping dialog of panicking characters. And, the product placements are way over the top. As other reviewers said, the kid is not a good actor, but he is a kid. I'm more concerned about the female character that drifts in and out of a thick Irish accent. Ugh!DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. Borrow from a library or Cracker Barrel . . . better yet, get it from one of the other reviewers who would be happy to offload their copy!"
3,Texas Wildfire by Wanda Owen,"Tony had no time for spoiled, wealthy Amanda. But when her innocent blue eyes haunted his days he knew he had to take her and satisfy his desire. She never dreamed that they would be caught in the flames of love."
1,De Longhi Electric Percolator-2-12 cup,"I have had nothing but frustration with this coffee pot. I have to use much more coffee because it doesn't perk longenough and is weak. Also, it isn't hot enough. I do nothingbut add coffee and keep pouring it back into the pot which makes a mess. I timed it today and it perked one minuteand was cold and weak. I am taking it to an appliance store today to see what they can do as this was not a cheap coffee pot. All the new electric coffee pots should perk much longer than they do. Nancy Hassett"
1,really bad product!!!,I purchased 2 of these within 6 months- and they both broke and were unrepairable very quickly- they cannot handle frequent(2-3 times ady) use and get clogged immediately. I would never buy another!!! Very disappointing!!!
3,Makes tasty coffee,"I have found that this coffeemaker makes better tasting coffee than a drip coffeemaker and it is fast! The only problem I found is, if you want to make a second pot, you must wait for it to cool completely or it will not brew the second pot properly."
2,Great coffee---for awhile!,"We received this as a Christmas gift a year ago (2002). For the first few months, we were dazzled; the coffee was terrific and it perked up fast. Then the plastic top cracked (at about 6 months). At about 9 months, the top could only be rested on the metal portion of the lid, so of course coffee leaked out during the perking. At 13 months, the heating element died and we're now in the market for a new cordless percolator. However, after reading customer reviews of the few other cordless models on the market, they seem to suffer similar weaknesses, so perhaps we'll just go back to a non-cordless model."
1,More Promise Than Truth,"Purchased this item about 6 months ago. Although good looking, continually had to pour brewed coffee back through the unit to get results, the glass top separated from the metal ring, the warm setting would burn the coffee, and finally a pin hole developed in the side letting water leak from the unit."
3,Percolator review,"The machine functions fine, but the coffee lacks the subtle degrees of smooth flavor achieved with a dip coffee maker. That's probably endemic to percolators and not a fault of this particular model."
5,Corporon does it again!,"Yet another success from the Klavier Wind recording project! As a member of a university wind ensemble, I greatly appreciate Klavier's dedication to recording new music for wind ensemble, a previously neglected medium. The selection of pieces on this recording is good and Corporon's interpretations are excellent. I have never heard such a flawless performance of ""Lincolnshire Posy"" which is quite difficult standard band literature. I was amazed by the ""Concerto for Solo Percussionist."" The composer, William Childs melds classical and jazz styling in a very effective way and the solo work is jaw-dropping. And, of course everyone will love ""Cartoon"" by Paul Hart. This piece brought me back to the classic cartoons of my childhood. This CD is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in wind band music."
1,MicroSuede Down Throw Brown,"Unfortunately, an alternative to the product I ordered was sent to me. Alternative was not acceptable. Am presently working with merchant regarding refund. Spokesperson from merchant has been very prompt and courteous."
2,You get what you pay for,"As a beginning moustache grower I read a few articles on how to maintain a moustache. I purchased this set and within the week the comb snapped in two and the teeth of the comb had already began to break off. The comb is a cheap piece of plastic and I was very unsatisfied. The wax itself was pretty weak. It is more greasy than waxy, so it did little to hold my moustache in place. An hour after I put it in my moustache would fray out and lose its shape. Ultimately I would suggest not purchasing this combo."
1,don't buy this,it sucks. it's hard and dried up... throw your mony in the trash can... never use this service... don't be stupid... i was...
3,works fair,"Works fair, but has a strange smell. I am still using this product and will also try others. Dont think I will reorder this product in the future."
2,Not the wax for a stubborn stache,"Wax doesn't keep its hold. Keep having to reshape stache. Is really hard to get it to not look like dandruff in your mustache. I'm Looking for a stronger wax to tame the hairs, and one that blends into the hair. Might work for someone with white mustache and hair already growing in the direction u want."
2,Buy anything else!,"I've had a handle bar for almost 4 years as such I have purchased Clubman's several times, only because it is readily available. It is by far the worst product I have ever used. It does not go on uniformly, you always have little chunks of wax in your stache that do not dry clear, which makes it look like you have mustache dandruff. It has never lasted me through a whole day; I used to carry it around in my pocket so WHEN it stopped working I could fix my mustache. But that was a problem because the tube ALWAYS springs a leak. It is also very hard to apply when your mustache is wet, which in the morning after a shower it usually is. I would recommend any other wax. I prefer hard heat per use waxes, but if you want something fast choose pretty much any other semi-firm wax. There are 2 things keeping me from rating this one star: It actually smells pretty good, and it is inexpensive so I never feel too ripped off when I break down and buy it."
1,Wrong one,"I ordered this black wax because I have a black mustache and I thought that I needed the black one. Boy was I wrong! I made a mess on my face, lips and hands, even the sink was full of blackness. It didn't hold on very well either. Dont buy the black one at all, get the white one."
4,"Good hold, color too light","The wax is stiff and provides a good hold, and is easy to apply with the included brush (I watched videos for pointers. A little goes further than you think it will. If you have dark brown hair, you will find this product too be too light a brown in color. I intend to get black and see how it works."
3,Good beginners wax,"I picked up a tube of this after I started to grow my moustache out. Some pros & cons:1. This stuff dries odorless... but while it sets (@ 10-15 mins), it smells like weird, old timey medicine. I don't mind it, but if you're not down with that, this is not for you.2. The hold lasts a while, but not all day (I now understand why Snidely Whiplash twirls his moustache; he uses Clubman). I have reasonably wavy hair though, so it may be that; or it may be the creature on my upper lip attempting escape. Who knows."
2,Wax extremely dry,The wax in this tube is extremely dry and difficult to extract. A can or tin of wax would be better and make for easier removal and usage. And the black coloring comes off easy and smudges on face!
2,Bad,"Maybe I did it wrong (although I followed the directions) but the stuff behaved just like boot polish would have. It was a bit greasy and it hardened to my mustache. What is more, it is not a natural shade of black so it looks very foolish when it is stuck in your beard and mustache. I would recommend trying a different product."
3,Good but tube broke,The stuff works pretty well but the tube its in burst before it was half empty. This wasted over half the product.
2,Its ok,this is ok for moustache wax. It smells good. The comb is useless. I prefer the moustache was that comes in a tube like chapstick. It works ok. I might buy again if I can't find the one I prefer. Price was fair and shipped quickly.
4,Holds Well!,"This wax may not last you the entire day, but it lasts me pretty much the whole day! Not too stiff but holds well. Make sure to get a color that is very similar to your natural color or else it will look a bit odd ."
5,Fantastiwax!,"This is a tremendous product. It delivers a firm, but organic hold. It does need to be a little warm to spread on right, but your body heat from keeping it in your pocket is sufficient. The little comb is neat, but not that necessary. I will use it as long as I have a moustache."
5,Envigorated my mustache with a subtle touch of class.,"Works as advertised. Provided a sensual brown tint to my mustache, instilling the vigor and confidence I needed. Goes great with my yellow Mazda Miata and my impending mid-life crisis."
3,Wax; does its job,"It's plain and simple mustache wax. I used my friend's hair wax before this got sent to me to properly form my handlebar mustache, and that worked just as well. And now that I've trimmed off my mustache, I don't have much use for this. I'd recommend getting some hair wax, which seems to work just as well, and then you can still use it on your hair..."
4,Newfound mustache glory.......,"I am a fledgling in the world of fancy facial hair so I bought this product based on the reviews and on the ""buzz"" on mustache forums, yes there are mustache forums; who knew!?! I think this is a great product for taming the beast that has been calling my upper-lip home for the past 9 months. The only grip I have is once wet the wax breaks down and my mustache looks like the morning after a binder. I know its for ease of cleaning etc, but I wish I could get further along in my night than my 2nd drink before i look like a mountain man!"
4,Great Hold But VERY Dark,"I have a light brown beard and moustache, so I purchased the ""Chestnut"" wax. Even this product color is way too dark. I look like Groucho when I use it. The product is very good, just not for people with light brown or light facial hair!"
3,It's okay,"This wax worked quite well at first, however it did not hold as well as I had hoped. I curled the ends of my mustache with it and it worked superbly for about an hour before my curls began to droop."
2,Not for me.,"I read a series of good reviews for this wax, and after trying it for a week, I have to give it a big thumbs down. I have a pretty coarse moustache, and to get this wax to even begin to hold I have to use about an 8th of the tube, and if I manage to get it the way I like it, it will barely hold for an hour. I bet that many a man will find clubman wax more than satisfying, but if you have very thick, coarse facial hair, clubman may not be up to the challenge."
3,Not for me.,"I've been growing out my soul patch for some time and decided I wanted to draw it into a point. I purchased an assortment of waxes which included Clubman. I quickly noticed a couple of problems with the product.1. Even in small amounts, the ""neutral"" color never seems to blend properly into my light brown facial hair. There are always small bits that are visible no matter how much I blend or comb with the included tool.2. It smells like shoe polish. It's not floral to me - it smells of harsh chemicals and is not pleasant to have on my face.On a high note, the shipping was lightning fast and the product was exactly what they are showing. If this product works for you, the price is good and it'll get to you quickly."
2,Didn't work for me,"I have a lighter brown/ dirty blonde facial hair and the neutral wax leaves my hair looking white and crusty which is not, in any way, the look I was going for. If it would blend in better, I would give it 5 stars as the hold is great...even like the smell. The lack of neutral properties of this product is why I would not reccomend it to folks with lighter hair."
2,it works for a smaller stache...,"When I first started growing my handlebar the clubman worked fine. As the stache was smaller it was easier to tame and keep its hold.Now that it has gotten significantly longer the Clubman no longer holds very well, I need to keep applying it throughout the day.Also the fact that its water soluble does not work for me. I have a cup of coffee and some gets on the stache the wax just dissolves.It is nice when washing it out or getting it off your fingers but in the rain, humid areas, or an accidental beer or coffee on your stache sends you to re apply again.Again, it is good for a smaller stache but not too good for a larger stache... in my opinion."
2,not worth it,It never held anything in place. That is what wax is for right? It also smelled bad. The people selling it were great as far as getting it to me fast. It just didn't work. Even after working it in for a while it still was visible.
3,WATCH OUT FOR WRONG PRODUCT !,I ordered approximately 10 Clubman Moustache Wax Chestnut products. I received 3 that were chestnut and 7 that were dark brown. I sent the 7 back and have yet to hear from anybody. In all probablity I was ripped off times 7. BE CAREFUL !!!!!!!!!!
5,Clubman Moustache Wax,"This moustache wax allows me to have a long (15-inch) handle bar moustache living in the desert climate of Las Vegas. I started using it 6 years ago when I could buy it at the local pharmacy. They went out of business, but fortunately I can order it on-line at Amazon. Thank you, Amazon!"
3,Mustache wax,Works good but seems to have impurities in the product. It does a good job of training my mustache to be combed.
5,Awesome,"I decided to grow out my moustache and needed somethingto do with it. The only thing I could think of was to twistit up on the ends until it started to really grow out. I sawsome other reviews of this product so I purchased a tube.It works great, a little goes a long way and it holds for a longtime.If you decided to finally become a true man and grow out your facialhair, I would highly recommend this product for your moustache."
3,It' mustache wax!,"C'mon, it's mustache wax tor crying out loud. The only reason I got it online is because where I live you really can't find much of anything. If it ain't at Wal-Mart, you're screwed...and WallyMart doesn't have this product."
1,"Horrible company, horrible product","I have never dealt with such a bad company. I deal with electronics companies daily, but this one takes the cake. I bought the PFD22 from a direct distributor and got the product, with outdated software that would not work on my Axim, OR my WinXP machine. They said I had to pay additional money for the updated software on CD that I just paid for the previous day. I would never EVER recommend this product to anyone. Customer Service at Pharos also took DAYS to get back to me on each reply."
3,What happened?,"Fangoria did a spread on the makeup effects, and the images were very cool. I watched them film the demon baby at a warehouse in Houston, and it looked like it was going to be cool also. Something happened. The resulting film is a typical horror story on a very low budget. Nothing to see here. Move along. Overall, I was very disappointed in what initially looked to be a decent horror flick.An aside on the baby: I watched for at least 3 hours as they dropped that baby onto a raised platform and they were still trying to get it to ""bounce"" properly when I left. These were all nice guys who made an unmemorable film. Still, it's worth watching if you're a horror fan."
4,Nice and comfy but..,"after a while my left shoe started widening at the heel, making it difficult to walk. I'm not sure if it's my foot or the way I walk or the shoe. But other that that, super sexy and very comfortable."
1,Fit wrong,"I always buy 10M, but in this case... the shoes are very small. They don't fit me well. Unfortunately I live in Chile, and is very difficult and expensive for me return or change a package..I will recommend brands like Naturalizer or Nine West. The number is correct all the time.LCR"
3,Not Brian Connolly,"This live cd although good does not feature original vocalist Brian Connolly, nor does it include original bass player/vocalist Steve Priest The Lead vocalist on this cd is Paul Deanno original vocalist of Iron Maiden."
5,Great Biblical Explanation of Reformed Theology,"I love this book. The description of Reformed theology (Calvinism, if you must) is much better than my book, and in much less space.But even more, I love the fact that this is one of those few books able to point out that Evangelical and Reformation orthodoxy was birthed and nurtured not in Europe, but in Africa. Christianity owes a great debt to those African saints who fought for the faith and were martyred so that we may know the truth. Origen, Athanasius, and the master theologian Augustine and many others all were Africans who were used powerfully by God to shape my faith. These men are among our spiritual fathers, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude. I owe them honor and respect, and each of us individually. I look forward some day in eternity greeting these great saints of God.This book is a great recounting of how important the diversity of culture in evangelical faith is to both our history and our future."
3,Not existentialist philosophy.,"Roberts' subject although interesting isn't quite what I'd hoped for in a book about creative authenticity. Oddly there's a book written by Dr. Eric Meisel, ""The Van Gogh Blues"" that takes disposition to Roberts' fourth principle: ""the Van Gogh Syndrome."" But that principle is easily digestible for Roberts book does not reach that level of psychology."
4,impressive,I am impressed by the contents of this book. I have been thinking most of these thoughts but this has put these thoughts all together in a way that solidifies all of those thoughts on creativity. I am about half way through it now and will certainly be going back through this book many times over. I do wish that it was available in an audio format. Those of us with failing vision really could use that kind of help.
4,"...from ArtsyFartsy News, July/August 2008","Yeah, I know, not another one of those ""artist self-help books."" You never finished reading your last one! But get this one - it's paperback, portable and you will get real answers to your ""artist problems."" You already know how I feel about painting everyday - strong, relevant and integrated. Ian Roberts is insightful, as well as being a fabulous painter.Here's what other book reviews have said about Creative Authenticity: ""...direct insights that are timeless and resonate for artists in any medium,"" ""could help in a big way if you run into personal and practical obstacles"" and ""...enthusiastically recommended reading for anyone wanting to engage in their own artistic aspirations.""So it's not just me! I've read it twice. If you want to make a difference in your art and your painter's life, this book just might be your new best friend.PS-- Not a step-by-step painting book! Get this book and read it!"
5,READ THIS,"I am a painter. I know all this! Yet, I NEED to read this book over and over! Ian Roberts is RIGHT ON!.....CLEAR and BRIEF. His ""painters soul"" shines in this small jewel of a book!"
4,a good book for serious artists....,"As a practicing graphic artists for many years, and always trying to understand the creative mood swings in making and creating art. I completely enjoyed the insight Ian Roberts writes about being an artists. Even though he writes from a painter's perspective, his book is completely applicable for all visual art makers. Being a serious artist is not easy and it shouldn't be...doing art is about stuggles...looking at a blank piece of paper or canvas can be frightening and this book breaks down the various areas to help understand and ease that fear. I highly recommend this book to any serious artists who is seeking to understand their own creative process."
1,Junk,This item is garbage that never worked at all.Plus the documentation is lacking. There is a scan button on the unit that is never mentioned in the instructions.
2,Unhappy with software,We have a version of this scanner from last year. Even with a new software download the print function is very unsatisfactory.
4,This product took some time to get used ...,"This product took some time to get used to. It was hard on my gums for the first week -- even made them bleed. But after awhile it toughened up my gums, and left excellent, refreshing breath! I'm still using it!"
5,After the first time I used this sort ...,"After the first time I used this sort of product, I almost didn't use it again! For the first few times that I used this, my gums were sore and raw from the baking powder. However, now I LOVE it!! My gums have gotten tougher and everytime I brush, it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist. It's a little gritty, and it smells weird. Overall, I think that baking soda toothpaste/powder has come a long way -- this is the proof that it did get better!"
2,Arm and Hammer Tooth Powder,"I have used this product for years, and I like it very much. I do not enjoy using toothpaste."
3,"Well, this was my first time using a ...","Well, this was my first time using a tooth powder for brushing. A lot of it got wasted while applying it on my toothbrush. Unlike toothpaste, this was gritty and had a bad taste!! I felt like I put a spoonful of salt in my mouth, although it did leave my teeth feeling cleaner than toothpaste does. If you can get around the grittiness and the taste, then this is a great product. But if you can't overlook those, this isn't a product for you."
3,I didn't like the fact that not much ...,"I didn't like the fact that not much of the powder was evident on my toothbrush. My teeth didn't feel as sparkling fresh. Also, it was a bit sweet."
3,The product didn't give my teeth and mouth ...,"The product didn't give my teeth and mouth that clean, fresh feeling that some toothpastes do. I wouldn't buy it."
3,Very more expensively,"For such money it is possible will buy Flashlight, and a knife. If that that happens it the goods to you will not help"
2,Alarm started going off,"I have this on my key chain and doing construction work I guess to much dust got in it. So the alarm started to go off randomly so I had to take the battery out. Now that those features don't even work anymore its just bulkier than it should be. I have not used the seat belt cutter or the spring-loaded point yet. I recommend getting the ResQMe version even though I have not used it, it does the same thing as mine now."
2,Disappointed in the lyrics...,"My daughter absolutely loves Shoo Fly, so I looked for other books by Iza Trapani, and found this one. I've always loved this song, so I bought it. Unfortunately the lyrics are all different, and not that very good on top of it. I could see (maybe) getting rid of the ""sword and pistol"" line, but the rest of it didn't need to change. I haven't even showed this to my daughter. I'm so afraid she'll like it, and I'll end up having to read it. I'm going to donate it to her childcare facility. The illustrations are beautiful, though!"
3,Great game...too bad it is no longer made,My best friends son loved this game from last year. I now understand it is discontinued so the game cartridges are no longer available for it. Very disapointing for him and my friend.
5,700 pages- pretty good.,"700 pages. OK, that says a lot right there. Of course it's apparently not in print any more. This is good; I would compare it to favorably to a rough equivalent,Diccionario Militar Ruso-Español (Spanish Edition), with 424 pages, one of two volumes, which has slightly more detail in what it covers."
1,delonghi deep fryer,This product fell apart a little at a time. 1st was the heating element where it enters the plastic housing. Second was one of the plastic feet. Third was the plastic part which holds the heating element to the fryer. Notice a theme here...plastic. Plastic does not hold up well to heat.Don't get me wrong this fryer worked great despite the broken plastic parts. The final part that broke was an internal switch which allowed no power at all. This switch could not be replaced since Delonghi uses special screws requiring special tools to remove them.
1,Owned competitor's model,"I was very happy with the cooking results from a unit that was produced by a competitor of DeLonghi, and it was very similar, however from the reviews that I have seen for the DeLonghi device it is evident that the same basic flaws were never corrected. I had to send my fryer back becuase the plastics used in the main control housing cracked and opened up the electrical areas to hot grease "" just waiting for a sudden fire"". As an engineer and an avid cook I would say do not risk your safety. I would say BUY a similar product only if the company ever stops trying to save a few bucks by using ""plastic"". I wish they would realize that customers would pay even twice as much for a GOOD and SAFE product."
1,Great deep fryer if you can get it to start.,"This has a detachable cord which is great for people who has small children, but it is also horrible to get the deep fryer to work. I bought my first one and I end up returning it to the store because there was no power. I bought another one that was on sale. I was happy because the second one worked and it fried great; however, the second time there was no power. They asked me to send it back and will provide a replacement. I hope the defect in the power source is corrected in the replacement because I love greasy food."
1,Don't let the pretty looks fool ya!,"Bought our unit with the intent of having it around for a while. Liked the seemingly unique design and functionality. WOW! WHAT A BUST!!!! Same problem as the other good folks in previous reviews. Powered it up one day, and the burners were INOP? Huh, must be the reset eh? nope??? Maybe the burner switch was not engaged? NOPE! Maybe an internal glitch or loose wire? Grrr! Couldn't pull the screws out do to the manufactures ""theft proof"" style design. Ended up cooking fresh halibut on the range. Sooooo I tried in vane, (written and verbally), to contact the company without any luck, (I'm still trying to figure out why it's called customer service?)My advise in short is to run from this product and don't get lured in by it's shiny design!"
5,Banjo Bandits Roy Clark/Buck Trent,"This is a great banjo album. How Roy and Buck can play that fast and in unison is a mystery to me. If you like 5 string banjo, this is a good album."
3,"Good...kinda weird, but good","I'm a bluegrass banjo fan and I found this CD to be pretty good...kinda weird....but pretty good. Roy proves himself to be a master with his hard driving banjo style particularily the double banjo pieces with Trent. However, some songs have drums and even keyboards, which, when coupled with banjo, yield a bizarre ragtime sound. I don't want to sound like the bluegrass police or anything, but some stuff on this CD like ""beerbarrel polka"" are definitely not bluegrass. Still, it's well worth listening to."
1,Tangled disaster,I don't know exactly what is wrong with this brush but every time I try to use it my hair becomes endlessly tangled. Maybe I need to break it in... Or maybe it only works on short hair. Either way it was a waste of my money. I've chosen to use my old brush -- that has 1/3 of the bristles missing -- over using this one. Tangles
4,TIMEZ ATTACK,"We homeschool our two sons and this game is a great way to practice the times tables. It is fast and repetitive - which is exactly what you want to really memorize these essential facts - yet exciting enough that our boys want to keep on playing. Kids retain so much more information when ""school"" is fun! Thanks for a great product!"
3,They need to work out the bugs,"This would be a great game if it wasn't for the ""bugs"". We have version 2.44 and it occasionally freezes when my son puts in an incorrect answer. The customer service dept. is very nice but they haven't been able to resovle the problems."
5,It takes some practice but multiplication skill increases,"My son (in 4th grade) likes this game a lot. At his school they do a weekly drill to write down the answers to as many multiplication problems as they can do in a minute. He went from the low 20s (before this game) to mid 30s (after playing this game after a weekend). It does take some practice to get used to typing the answers on the keyboard. His words:""Timez Attack is the best multiplication practice game that I have ever played. From playing it, I know up to the 12's (12 times table). I would recommend it to anyone who wants practice with their multiplication (and likes video games).""I added the parts in parens."
2,OK wand sprayer,"I purchase two of these sprayers to replace some I purchased at Wally World three years ago. They came in bent up from shipping, but I was able to straighten them out enough to use, but was disappointed that it didn't have a soak-er setting for watering plants. It didn't give all the type spray settings in the description, so needing sprayers badly, I kept them...Price was ok!"
5,Battle Stations - Lancaster Bomber: Target Germany,I bought this for my 86 year old father for Christmas 2006. We all watched it together and it was fabulous! He was a career RAF officer and flew Lancaster's during the war. It brought back a lot of memories for both of my parents and made me realize just what he'd gone through over 60 years ago. I highly recommend this DVD.
3,The Roman Empire in decline,"This book is a fascinating blend of history, legend, and fantasy. This book was clearly heavily researched and includes numerous footnotes explaining the authors' interpretations. In this first book of the series, we are introduced to our protagonist and the city-state of Ys. This book sets the stage for the rest of the series and starts slow, but it provides a wealth of historical detail about the waning days of the Roman Empire."
2,NOT TEAR FREE,"Just make sure you know this is not a tear-free formula. I only found out when my son started screaming while I was washing his hair. On the flip-side, I have been using it for my own hair and love it. So, buy it for yourself but not for the baby."
5,Good for Grownups,I bought this for myself and love it. It lathers and rinses out easily and doesn't strip my hair.
1,Not TEARLESS,"Love the smell, brigs back memories.Sadly this was included in items to be used on the newest of newborns which I used. Its now wonder she screamed and cried. I tried it out on my own eyes and i was down for the count. should be listed to be used on BODY only."
1,Too bad it burns baby's eyes!,"I am a big fan of Burt's Bees products, however, I will not be purchasing this again. This was included in a kit that I bought for my child and also for a friend who just had her first baby. Unfortunately, I discovered that this product is NOT TEAR FREE while I was washing my little one's hair. She began to rub her eyes and cried when it ran down into them. Why on Earth would anyone make a bath/hair product for children that isn't tear free? It makes no sense to me."
5,Third Eye Blind's 2nd and 3rd CDs followed the 1st but got no credit!,"I just want to let everyone know that if you don't have blue and out of the vein, then you need to purchase them. 3rd Eye Blind became one of the most under rated bands due to their terrible exposure. This CD has many of the great songs from those CDs, and I guarantee you will enjoy it."
3,Is anyone else surprised that there are 19 songs on this,"Is anyone else surprised that there are 19 songs on this hits collection? If you can name 6 songs or more that were released during Third Eye Blind's fifteen minutes of fame, then you can't go wrong picking this up. I must admit that the songs I'm not familiar with are just as good as their commercial stuff. Although, if you're among the many that can't name 6 songs, you can hear ""Semi-Charmed Life"" on the radio everyday."
3,"Where's ""Never Let You Go?""",op po op po op po op po op po po p opo po pop opop o popop popoo o o o o o o o o o o o p p p p p p p p p pp
3,Missing a vital track!!!,"In my opinion, any ""greatest hits"" that fails to put in one of its best songs musically as well as lyrically needs to get a poor review. ""London"" is one of Blind's best songs, clever, campy and it didn't even make it onto the album!???!!!??? This to me is absurd. Chalk this ""compilation"" up to nothing but that...a compilation. Thankfully all of my other favorite songs are on it so I'm not trashing the whole album. It just seems that I've never ever seen a greatest hits come out that has all the songs it should. Maybe it's mere opinion, but when everyone I know who likes Blind says ""London"" is one of their favorites, and then they don't put it on the ""collection""???!!! Something is serious awry! - a disgruntled Blind fan"
5,The Best 3rd Eye Blind CD Yet,This CD is the Best Yet. I like 3rd-e-b but after i listened to this i loved it. It is definently worth Buying
4,Great Mid-to-Late 90's Group,"I enjoyed Third Eye Blind in the late 90's, especially ""Graduate"". Had never heard a white-bread group ask the musical question ""Can I get my punk ass off the street?"" before. Most of the songs have very catchy hooks, even the ones I am not that fond of. They bring a lot of energy to their music. I always felt the only downside for the group was leadman Stephen Jenkins' tendency to be a little annoyingly theatrical. Always enjoyed the guitar hooks and solos. Definitely worth a $5 purchase!!!!"
2,Tippmann 98 Custom Kit,"The gun works well but the remote sucks. You cannot use the quick disconnect on the remote because the o-ring swells up and pops out. It is a pain to put back. I waited for it to heat up after use (6 hours later) it still popped out The ""anti-fog"" mask, well lets just say it's not so anti-fog. I have played 4 times and my harness/pod holder broke. One of the pod sleeves came unsewn."
3,Uh Oh! This book is in Spanish?,"The only reason I gave this item 3 stars is because it is in Spanish. When I ordered the book for my daughter, I intended to get the book in English. Boy was I suprised when it arrived! I LOVE the book in English and plan to order it that way next time. Please double check the book description before you order. I only found it listed in one (not obvious) place in the description! Don't make the same mistake I did!Elmer"
1,didnt want spanish,"I had no intention of ordering 2 spanish versions of this book. I am not happy that I will have to pay to return them since ""I"" made the mistake. I went back and rechecked the description and it didnt mention that the books are in spanish. Not sure what I will do from here but not too happy about the situation. I have a class waiting for these books."
5,A great master applies quantum mechanics.,"These are the notes of the Fermi lectures on nuclear physics at Chicago. As a book on nuclear physics they are, of course, too dated. However, I strongly recommend this book for he who wants to see a great master solving problems of various kinds. Besides the usual topics of alpha and beta-decays, nuclear models, scattering, etc, there are beautiful treatments of passage of radiation through matter, origin of cosmic rays and action of the Earth's magnetic field on incoming charged particles. The book is a monumental collection of very good exercises of quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, relativity, etc. In this sense , it will never become obsolete."
5,Wool Parisian Beret,"This is a nice beret. It's just the right size. It comes down over my ears and allows stud earrings to show. If it's really cold you can unfold the band and cover up your ears completely for warmth. It's hard to find berets in the stores and the ones you can buy on the street are always too big. It was not very expensive, it's nice and warm, and looks good on me."
3,OK but not great,"One-size beret, nice color, decent quality, nothing like a real French or Basque beret, seemed overpriced, looks pretty good."
4,A great book for Confined Space Rescuers,This book is a good summary for Confined Space rescue training - better than other recent CMC works that serve to advertise CMC products.
4,Diamond Head - 'Friday Night Rock Show Sessions' (Raw Fruit),"Nicely archived live CD release. Likely very hard-to-find without spending an arm and a leg. I've always liked this long-running 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' band. First two tracks here are from a 1980 in house recording session ""Sweet And Innocent"" and the *ss-kicking ""Lightning To The Nations"". The rest ""Am I Evil?"" (heavy influence to Metallica), ""Borrowed Time"", ""Play It Loud"" and the other three come from the 1982 Monsters Of Rock festival in Donnington. Line-up: Sean Harris-guitar & vocals, Brian Tatler-guitar, Colin Kimberly-bass and Duncan Scott-drums. Good live import disc to add to your collection. A definite should-have."
2,Falls short,"True, the Harry Potter series is one of the best around, for kids and adults with imaginations. However, this pop-up book falls very short of any expectations one might have. There are very few pages to look at, no words at all, just cartoonish scenes."
3,Creative yet bulky...,"Need I say more? The pop-up book is cool, yet it is too big, and it's hardly a book. 12-pages? More like a 360 degrees book."
3,Macedonia,"The birthplace of Alexander the Great. The video itself is very interesting and the excavations at Vergina and the discovery of King Philipp's tomb is outstanding.I would give this video a 5,however the narrator as well as the overall presentation is terrible.Archeology is great.This great video should be redone in a more modern mannor.I hope that a new one with a better narrator will be presented to the public.It looks like somebody is reading without any enthousiasm of this fantasic place like Macedonia.Absolutely no feelings into it."
1,Worst buy from amazon.com in the past year,"Imagine the worst low budget movie you ever seen. Well this was worse. The music is bad and picture washed out most of the time. The information would be somewhat useful if the Greek propaganda that all that Macedonia was, is now is in Greece's territory. Historically untrue and full of speculation. Worst buy from amazon.com in the past year."
4,"Very moving, original love story between an unlikely pair",I loved this book and can't believe it's out of print. It will get you hooked on fiddleheads too.
5,BLISS,"I love this story. It's a yearly reread, just grabs me and I can hardly put it down. I need it for my Kindle!"
3,Just OK,This book has a nice format but is much easier than the problems you will find on the actual test. It is probably worth looking at as a secondary reference only.
4,Solid -- especially helpful for the writing section,"This is a pretty solid all-around GRE prep. Especially helpful, though, is the part about creating templates to deal with the analytical writing session. This advice in itself makes the book worthwhile."
1,yet another complaint about the software,"I fully agree with jorinwolf's contempt for the software, but I wish to add another complaint: the practice exams, in my case, were significantly *easier* than the actual test. That, of course, is the opposite of how it should be--you want difficult practice tests that make the real thing seem easy.Imagine my shock when I realized, halfway through the actual GRE, that it was taking me much longer to finish than the practice exams had. I panicked and almost froze up.In the end, preparing with this software probably *hurt* my score."
2,Worthless software,"As many others have noted the book is passable, but the software attached to it for the computer simulated test is simply a disaster. Not only it sometimes ditches your whole test instead of grading it, it demands a registration (which results in a lot of spam), and the program didn't even adapt itself to my display format (i.e. you have to hold the ""appropriate"" display mode or part of the screen (including the crucial bottom buttons) will be offscreen. Considering I basically bought the book for the computer tests besides making it REALLY annoying to read the long texts with small font, this is just worthless and the work of complete amateurs. Granted the GRE is a silly test, but I would have expected some level of professionalism from those who describe themselves as experts. The book itself I found nearly worthless since the questions in it are too easy and you are simply not going to learn math and vocab from one single book in a rush."
2,So-so review,"Hi everyone,I took the GRE's in 2004 and did well. I received my acceptance to graduate school! (Yeah!). Regarding this book, I originally bought it because I heard all Princeton Review books were a must have. At first, I thought so. Most of the review for the math/verbal section is basic, and for me, I felt the book talked down to me. The only valuable information I found was in the Writing Section. The Writing section provides a good starting point/helpful pointers for people who do not know how to start essays. But watch out. They follow the same pattern in each essay, so make your unique. I would rather wait for this book to be in the library or work/read the essay section only. DON'T waste your time on the CD-ROM. The CD-ROM is not updated to the current MCAT -- the Analytical section is still on it."
4,"Decent for beating the test, not the material","This is the ideal book for those who don't have the time to study the actual material. It is chock full of hints and strategies, but the review of the actual material was pretty good. I found that what I really needed was to review the material, and the test-taking strategies really got in the way. Unlike many others, I did not have trouble with the online tests, though it took me two days to get my computer updated with the proper software. In the end, I ignored the online tests, using them only as a way to practice taking the test, not for evaluating my progress. I then focused on studying the discussion of the material itself, and did really well. My advice? Ignore the test-taking strategies, focus on the review material, and don't use the online tests to evaluate your progress."
2,Practice material did not correspond with actual GRE,"I had taken the GRE in 1999 on paper. When I was preparing to re-take the GRE, I bought this book to understand the changes in the test and to practice on the computer. My practice scores were excellent (far exceeding my performance in 1999), so I went into the actual test expecting to do well. However, my verbal score was 80 points below what it was in 1999, and 120 points below my average practice test from the CD-ROM. While the information for the analytical section was helpful, the verbal reasoning practice sections and vocabulary are not challenging enough. You would do well to look elsewhere for verbal practice."
4,"Tink Tink, No Boom Boom","I put two of these 5.25"" Alpines in my Honda CR-V 2003 EX. I made spacers out of 1/2"" gatorboard. I had to take off the door panels and drill 4 holes in the metal of my door. Nice & bright sound - I have my highs/treble back that were not present in the factory speakers. However, the bass and even lower rich midtone is lacking. I would get these again and use in perhaps two doors, but I would not recommend them all the way around. Many people are using 6.5"" speakers that offer more mid-bass in CR-Vs with minor mods. Construction/build is very well done!!! - nice hefty magnet and only 2"" surface mount depth. Comes with speaker wires that are useful as the have connectors that fit onto the speaker terminals securely. The pivoting tweeters let you aim the highs (upward, in my CR-V's low-mounting position). Possibly the best buy for the money. If you have a subwoofer, you are set. If you are using the factory radio, consider 6.5"" ?"
1,Terrible sound - no buy recommendation,"Don't believe on the ""deep base"". This thing is base free, it simply booms if you put base to it. Use a filter to avoide bases and use a sub, as the other review suggests. Or buy Infinities."
5,adidas,"i ordered the shoe originally in july with a bunch of other stuff but never received the shoes, reodered and now that i have received them i am completely satisfied. just wish my lil boy could wear them longer. his foot grew a lil bit in a few months but other than that its a great shoe and once the order finally shipped it didnt take long for me to get them in alaska!"
4,Interesting but slow reading,I'm not a political scientist so this was a slow read for me. It's thought provoking however and is an interesting oversight of late nineteenth century American history. Probably not a beach book for most people but well worth reading.
4,"Quite fun, and clever","This is not a chummy kitchen science experiment book. The science is serious and some principles obtuse. I studied this sort of thing in college and found some of it tough going, though I do think I came away with a lucid understanding for the effort.The author rambles a bit, mixing exposition and reminisces. This is not a terrible thing, but may not be what you expect. Some of the experiments are elegant and clever, and impressed my 6 year-old considerably. The author's bent is towards optical phenomena, such as why the sky is blue, more than the meteorological, though there's plenty in there.A fun and interesting book in a conversational and sometimes amusing format. And yes, I finally can explain why the sky is blue."
5,Wisdom Through Wonder,"My husband is a student meteorologist and interested in atmospheric physics; this book is written simply enough that it is enjoyable to read and understandable even to a layman like myself, while sharing enough scientific detail that my husband enjoyed it. While you could conduct your own experiments with this book, the experiments are explained as if the author is telling an interesting story and always followed by a scientific explanation about how the prior example relates to atmospheric physics. It's really not necessary to recreate the experiments yourself, unless you want to.I thought it was an enjoyable book that sought to make the reader more curious and interested in atmospheric physics through examples and topics we could relate to. Nice gift for a scientifically inclined person, at a reasonable price."
2,"Clues, but not one idea","This is a terrible book with an attractive title. It i a collection of inexpensive experiments to teach atmospheric physics 1.01. The author was happy to publish his lectures notes: that can certainly be useful to another teacher, but it does not make a book. For instance, the book is made of a series of experiments: it is not organized by concepts and the concepts are not explained. It is not a book. You can find hundreds of such experiments for free on the internet, many of them on Youtube."
3,Kirk & McCoy save McCoy's daughter.,"One of the early ""Kirk must save the planet"" novels, with Mccaoy's daughter thrown in for good measure.Medium quality Star Trek novel.""A Science Fiction Book Club Alternate Selection"""
3,Where are my two faves?,"Although all of these tracks are terrific, my two favorite PJ Harvey/John Peel tracks were NOT included! Where are ""Claudine (My Inflatable One)"" and ""Primed and Ticking?"" Those are two of her best songs ever, and I was extremely disappointed to find them missing. Definitely detracts from what could have been a perfect (and more complete) collection. Now I'm waiting for the sequel!"
5,Swamp rock for sure,"I bought the LP version and on the cover is a label that says, ""SWAMP ROCKIN' TEXAS TRIO KICKS SOME SERIOUS BUTT""That is exactly what they do on the recording. My favorites are Crawfishin' and Sidewinder."
5,great shampoo,"This shampoo is great, especially for people with dry, frizzy, or color-treated hair. It smells great too!"
3,no more online,"i purchesed tis game elsewhere, i tryed to play it online and the tribes mother server has switched to tribes 2 and its not much fun alone so i sugjest u pay a little extra 4 the usable online version"
4,"Great game, but why pay for it?","You already know that Tribes is a great game from the other reviews, but did you know you can now get it for free?With the upcoming release of ""Tribes: Vengeance"", Vivendi Studios has made Starsiege: Tribes available for free to the public, downloadable off of www.fileplanet.com. So don't bother paying tewnty bucks for the jewel case, when you can have the full version of the game within hours for free, instead of within days for upwards of thirty dollars."
2,Haven't gotten this product to work,"I have a Motorola V400 phone (Motorola says this is the right kit for this phone, although it is not on the list of compatible phones at Amazon). Anyway, I can't get the phone driver to install on Windows XP. This may not be a problem for other phones, but I wanted to warn buyers who have a V400 that ths product did not work with my V400."
1,You'll either love it or hate it,"This is the type of software that you either love or hate - as you can tell by the other reviewer's ratings. If you simply want to sync your phone with MS Outlook (which makes entering contact information a breaze), this product is for you. If you are a person trying to sync ""popular Personal Information Management (PIM) software"" (direct quote from package) with your phone, it doesn't appear to be possible, so don't waste your time or money.I bought this product to keep my v60 phone in sync with my Palm software. Basically, I'm screwed. I've been trying (on and off) for the last 3 months to find a way to download a Palm sync application. The package says that ""additional PIM application support available via online product updates."" THEIR ARE NO ADDITIONAL PIM APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE! Don't be mislead.If you want to do anything besides sync with Outlook, this product isn't worth its shipping cost."
1,Useless and unsupported buggy junk,"I ordered this kit when I purchased my v.60t phone last year. Software arrived with very poor documentation. I wasted about 5 hours trying to get it to install on win98se and winME with no luck at all. Could not reach any form of human tech support, and finally gave up and returned it for a full refund. I am now going to try some newer third party software and see if it works. I can't believe Moto even released this junk...the only people I know who got it to work run win2k and are IT professionals.Don't waste your time or money."
1,Why Bother,"I purchased this cable because I was interested in wireless internet connection. My local ISP only pulled in at about 14kbps and I was looking for a reason to drop my wireline connection anyway.I only have one thing to say. SLOW!!! It only pulls 9.6kbps max. This was confirmed by Cingular's customer service. If you are looking for wireless internet, this is not the way to go."
4,"look at the plug on the phone side, supports T722i too","mainly, I use the cable only, and I found an interesting socket on plug to phone, that's power passthrough, that is a must if you use phone as modem to go internet for hours at a time, and keeps charging the phone even it is connected to computerrecently, I got T722i with tmo internet (GPRS, 40k max), and I found the power passthrough is very useful, then I don't have to worry the battery runs out (the power passthrough connects the travel charger)one more, the cable supports T722i as well, when the software don't (except the driver, uses T720 driver)"
1,Not for all phones listed,"I bought the data kit mainly because I needed to synchronize my calendar. I have a V120t phone and when I try to synch, only the contacts worked. The program didn't gave me the option for the calendar. I downloaded the upgrade with no effect. I tried contacting starfish and Motorola for help and Starfish told me that they do not provide support for motorola products, Motorola haven't answer my mails...What a waste of money."
4,Great sunglasses,"This is the second pair of RB 4075 Polarized glasses. I lost the first pair on my move back from LA. I liked them enough to re-buy them.The only con with these glasses is if you are switching from glasses that have a thinner arm, you will notice you lose you peripheral vision. The thick arms tend you block you ability to quickly check your blind spot while driving. However you will adjust.Oh yes, Ray-Ban also adds a ""P"" after their logo on the lens to indicate that they're Polarized. I think it's a tacky addition."
5,Great quality lenses!,"I bought the black frames with the glass G-15 lenses and they're great quality.I previously had a pair of Ray-bans with plastic lenses and in addition to the concern over scratching them, they just didn't feel substantial enough.However, the RB4075 has restored my faith in the quality of Ray-ban products!"
5,Great Purchase,"I was very pleased with these Ray Bans. Got them for my son-in-law, he loves them. They feel like silk as you put them on and have a feather-weight on your face. This lens style is a bit wider than the classic style but unmistakably Ray Ban. The crystal green lenses appear black and very stylish. They fit him perfectly. Do pay attention the the size when you order a pair of Ray Bans. 61mm is one of the wider ones."
4,great glasses,"I really like these glasses. They are a bit larger than I expected, but it seems all glasses are that way these days. They have a nice weight and do not hurt my nose or pinch at the ears. Looking through them feels quite comfortable."
3,"Not matte black, gloss black","I like the glasses but I ordered and wanted them in matte black. Oh well, the price was right and returning them is way too much hassle. I'll live with it."
4,Early work that looks forward to Jay and... on to Can't Buy.,"To even touch this collection, you have to be a serious enthusiast. There have been several ""compilations"" of various versions of these songs released, beyond the bootlegs. Anyway, a look behind the curtain before Denny, Skunk, Carlton, and probably ""The immortal"" engineer. Recommended for the serious old or new Dan fan. Good hunting."
4,Great Stuff,"This ""Masters Album"" is better than the other demo albums because of how much music it includes. Its got ""A little With Sugar"" and ""This Seats Been Taken"" which a lot of them dont. ""A Little With Sugar"" by the way is great, and whole slew of other raw recordings that may not be the best songs, but are worth having in your collection."
1,Becker must have fallen off the wagon to release this album,"I made better recordings at age ten with my five button recordmatic. The kind you had to push record and play at the same time, and hold up the little black microphone to your sisters Barbie Phonograph to make a cassettes. Don't get me wrong, Steely Dan is my all time favorite group. However, this ""compilation""is embarassingly sophomoric. This clearly is a slap in the face, to what is perhaps the pinnacle of sophistication in Jazz. Stick with the box set to get some rare cuts, this CD is not all there."
3,Is In the Kindle Store or Not???,"I'm rating three stars because I'd love to read the book, but even though Amazon says it's got a Kindle version, the Kindle store says not. Does anyone know if it's really possible to get a Kindle version of ""Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military""?"
2,Hypocrisy,Mr. Haqqani has dubious credentials as he has served in a number of very corrupt governments in Pakistan's problematic history. Although I agree with some of his views overall he has vested interests that do not allow him to be a honest contributor to Pakisan tumultous history.
4,The author is the current Pakistan Ambassador to the United States,"Given his current and past roles with the Pakistan government, the author is uniquely positioned to provide commentary on the establishmment and recent history of Pakistan. The book describes the country's role in nuclear proliferation and fostering of terror groups active in the West and in India. The combination of military rule, based on Islamic support, US alliance and an anti-India policy have defined its entire existence and brought it to the condition it is in today. The discovery of Osama hiding in a military controlled Pakistani city is now causing some re-examination of Pakistan-US ties by both sides.Very relevant reading on the most dangerous spot in the world today."
4,Pakistan and Learning Our Future National Interests,"This work provides excellent survey and basic political history of a nation far too long ignored by the United States at all levels. The reader here can avoid the pitfall of popular historical and political writing that too frequently bogs down in cultural minutia. The complexity of modern Pakistan is presented to the reader who wishes to be brought up to date on an old international player who has a new key role not only in American foreign policy, but in matters of international security. Pakistan has the second largest islamic populace in the world, has been governed more by generals than candidates from the body politique. A developing nation from the residue of British imperialism that is threatened by islamic radiclaism, and tribal and ethnic based banditry and insurrections and with a nuclear weapons capability that has been recklessly marketed abroad. Those stories and more are in this work."
5,Gotta have it...,"HAHA, ...'s review is really funny. Creed and Nickelback...this band sounds nothing like the [stuff] you hear on the radio today...thank god! Fred Durst musical genius? Oh my god shoot me now. Go get this album and while you're at it check out Modest Mouse, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Tortoise, GYBE, Arab Strap..."
4,Eh.. 3.7 stars,"Don't get me wrong, ""Relative Ways"" and ""Homage"" are awesome songs, but the other two songs drag down the quality of this ep.""Relative Ways"" is a great song, but ""Another Morning Stoner"" should of been the first single off of the new cd. ""Homage"" is one of the most chaotic songs TOD have recorded, starting of violently fast, then slowing down for the chorus.However, the next two songs, ""Blood Rites"", and ""The Blade Runner"", are not good. ""Blood Rites is a halfway decent song, while ""The Blade Runner"" is not a song.So, if you want the first two songs, buy the AMAZING new ""Source Tags and Codes"", but if you're a completist, go for this."
3,Not bad...,"The albbum has some great songs. The duo with Bono is really great and can't be cranked up loud enough. The song from Last of the Mohicans is great. The rest fo the them are ok, more traditional irish music than a blended crossover of Irish and pop, which is where Clannad really shines (such as the song with Bono). Not bad..."
2,"Definitely ""underwhelmed""","Well, there's no use trying to rationalize it -- this ""best of"" collection was definitely a disappointment.The very first cut, ""In a Lifetime"" has Bono groaning and screaming on it, and I was certainly not expecting to hear THAT on a Clannad album at all! If I listen to this album much, I'll cut a duplicate CD, but leave the first track off entirely. Bono should stick to being trendy-and-cool while wearing his tired, old big-wrap sunglasses, protesting the indignities of the world, and pretending that it's still the '70's -- but NEVER appearing on a Clannad album again!The rest of the album is OK... if you've followed Clannad much at all, the songs are somewhat familiar to you. Nothing really fresh or interesting about it, so, if you already have these songs on other Clannad albums, there's no incentive to buy this CD. They have a number of ""best of"" albums out, so if I had this to do over I'd pick one that didn't have Bono on it...."
3,I love Clannad but.........,"Clannad is one of my top fav groups. However, this is nothing but redo of redo. When are they going to do something new? If you have never bought Clannad this is fine album. For fans, YOU HAVE ALL THESE LIKELY SEVERAL TIME!! BEWARE."
1,what a waste,This album bites. The brief interludes of prostituted classical music are the only redeeming qualities. What is with the irritating children's vocals?
1,ripped three in 15 minutes,"I put them on, within the first 15 minutes driving, two were ripped and a third tore off. The metal mount plate remained secure, but the polyurethane was ripped or broken off. This was on a 4000 pound SUV."
4,Clean Teeth,I find that in using this product this incidence of plaque is reduced. The baking soda content seems to work.
4,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling very clean, ...","This toothpaste left my teeth feeling very clean, like I'd just come from the dentist. The texture of the toothpaste was different from my usual brand, and at first I thought the taste was awful. But after using it a few times, the flavor didn't bother me quite as much, especially if I used a mint-flavored mouthwash afterward. I'd consider buying it again, if the price were comparable to my usual brand."
4,"BUY IT NOW (Oct., 2005)","I paid $79.95 a few months ago. I liked it. Now it's $39.95.BUY TWO, give one to a friend. Looks good, works great. Four slices, all equally well toasted. The extra-lift lever gets that bagle or English muffin out where you can grab it. No tongs needed. First toaster that I ever owned that drew envious glances, from a MAN!"
3,Family story,It is a bit repetitious and not particularly interesting in the manner in which it was written - more like a family diary rather than for public consumption.
4,A Gem of History,"Without this book, a bit of history which deserves to be known, would have disappeared from human knowledge. From that standpoint,it is a woderful book and deserves a 5 rating. From a readability standpoint,it is filled with details which are often repeated, This takes its rating down a bit,in my opinion."
4,Researched history about the Holocaust,"This book is a well-written and documents the research of various individuals, and provides solid vindication and a basis for praise for Major Karl Plagge of the WWII German Wermacht. Enough detail was provided to keep me rivited and yet not enough to gross me out. This is the expanded edition, containing specific names, etc. for the interested WWII buff."
5,Great book,An exhillarating adventure about a man who stood up not for what is cool or in style but for what is right
4,The Search for Major Plagge: The Nazi Who Saved Jews,Major Plagge got long overdue recognition at last; story is a little dragged out but a good one. I think there must have been many good people in Germany who dispised what Hitler was doing but didn't want to jeopardize their families and friends.
3,Dragged on too long,"I always like to read books about WWII. This one started off well enough. I enjoyed reading about the families involved. However, it dddrrrraaagggggeeeeedddd after the halfway point."
3,Ding Dong,This bell looks nice and is real easy to connect. But the bell is not very loud and I can't hear it if I am in the basement. But I will keep it since it looks nice and I don't know if any other bell/chime would be louder. I don't want music and i don't want the long chime tubes hanging on my wall.
5,Arm and Hammer Dental Gum,"After using this gum between brushings my dental check ups were phenomenal...the dentist could not find any plaque to clean. She said ""This doesn't happen, what is your secret?"" Arm and Hammer Dental Gum, that's what my secret is. Then it became unavailable...Where did it go??? Arm and Hammer PLEASE bring it back. No other product works like it, and my teeth are suffering! If anyone knows where to find some please respond."
3,Not Magnetic Hematite,"I was wanting to buy a hematite bracelet to see if it would really help with my health. Hey. Don't laugh. I'm willing to try anything at this point. lol. Some people actually believe it works. Anywho, back on track. It's not hematite. I am still going to keep it because it is pretty and fits nicely. But if you want a hematite bracelet/anklet, this is not it."
3,Amusing,"I do enjoy all of Lansdowne's books, she always brings such wonderful characters to life. It is the animals in this series that are my favorite, from Lord Nightingale to Stanley Blithe. They think like people and are just as interesting. However, this book was not as enthralling as the first two. It was just a little too light-I didn't think I'd ever say that! Problems were just too easily solved and things too easily dismissed. I'm looking for the next installment!"
4,An Authentic Voice,"Autobiographies are at the same time the best and the worst sources of life stories. You get the authentic voice, but that voice tells you only what it wants you to believe. Both these characteristics are particularly strong here because Cody's voice is such a distinctive one and because of his status as a supreme self-promoter. So this book will not give you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but it will give you a real insight into the mind of a man who in many ways epitomizes the culture of the historic American West. Some of it may shock you; Cody describes how he shot a mule who had annoyed him by running away, and boasts of how he scalped his fallen enemies. Hardly the stuff of popular myth. If you want to know how the west was really won, then reading this book (some of it 'between the lines') will tell you much."
4,Buffalo Bill,"EXCITING STORIES OF THE OLD WEST AND BUFFALO BILLS ADVENTURES .... BUT THE END WAS ABRUPT, IT NEVER GAVE ME INFORMATION ABOUT HIS FINAL DAYS OR WHERE HE WAS BURIED."
2,Boooooring,"Ad nausem stories that go on forever and ever. Stopped reading halfway through because of tedious, endless, self promoting tales."
2,Interesting as semi-history...,"Well, what could we expect of ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody? Self-aggrandizing, overly-exaggerated claims of his own greatness. I suppose this was common in similar ghost-written autobiographies of the age...It's interesting to read a portrait of the western frontier in it's waning years. The writer will inevitably cringe at the cheerful callousness with which Cody describes the systematic destruction of Native Americans and their way of life. Interesting fact from the book: did you know he earned his moniker by killing scores of buffaloes just to win a bet? It's not clear, but it sounds as though the slaughtered animals were left to rot in the plains. Then this buffoon goes on to scratch his head at the animosity the Plains Indians have toward him."
2,interesting,"Good reading if you consider the man and his time in history. Otherwise, you may have trouble with some of the descriptions of native people."
5,First person account without puff or bluster,"Cody's autobiography describes fantastic events and times. It is a sometimes grisly story with killings of Indians and buffaloes. He himself killed over 4000 buffalo. He wrote about how he scalped an Indian ""scientifically,"" that is quickly, after a one-on-one fight in which he killed the Indian.Cody was a Pony Express rider, a scout for wagon trains, and a scout for the US Army in the Indian wars of the 1870s. Journalists wrote about his exploits and Cody became a superhero of the late 1800s. Easterners coaxed him into taking part in a stage production about the Wild West even though he was overwhelmed initially by stage fright. Eventually he was able to perform on stage.Cody was a friend of Wild Bill Hickok and got Hickok to take a starring role in some productions. Hickok would make the Indian actors in the play jump and dance realistically by shooting the black powder blanks so close to the actors that they would get powder burns on their legs."
3,Not the best,"I have read better stories about Buffalo Bill. This one is too back and forth, no continuancy. It would have been better with more family information."
4,A glimpse into an interesting life,This book is worth reading to get a glimpse into recent history. The core of the book is about Buffalo Bill's life as a buffalo hunter and Indian tracker. The accounts of casual slaughter are appalling but an interesting insight into an era when the wild buffalo herds seemed inexhaustible and the various Indian tribes were trying to figure out how to respond to the changes to their traditional way of life.
4,The perfect guide,This was fun to read. For us it is history but for William Cody it is his time. Life as he knows it. Books like this help us know ourselves better.
5,puts it all together,"some real classics, UT2004 and Unreal 2 will still be playable for years. all in one place. lots of fun."
5,Thanks,"Wanted to get it anyway, instead of downloading (which take longer time due to my internet) these are pretty good. Only thing is, for a newbie, having to find out and learn more thing to have stuffs set up properly (which patch is for what, etc) and then it's good to go."
1,Disgruntled at my purchase,"So, i ordered this game, because my spare copy is severely damaged, But when it arrived in my mailbox..I opened the package, and i noticed..It was the Sold Out software edition. Now i didn't find this as a problem, that was until i launched the installer.EVERYTHING..was changed, compared to my previous version, The ""Sold Out"" version is horrid. I was sincerely expecting a US copy by looking at the images. Guess i was wrong.I was very dissapointed at my purchase. I know this may be a little problem, But it just Doesn't have the same feel like my US copy did."
2,Unreal collection,"Sin el fallido UT2003, esta collecion de juegos Unreal es la mejor hasta ahora, y mas aun con todos estos 4 titulos en un solo DVD y claro un pekeño CD de la banda sonora de algunos de ellos."
1,Misleading support,"All games included in this collection support linux. The box has tux on it, however this collection repackages things and does not support it anymore.This should be considered false advertising and someone should sue at some point. Maybe a class action where we can all get our money back?"
5,Loved by this reading specialist,"I'm a reading specialist and author (""Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies""). If your child is beyond beginners books, like Bob Books and Dr Seuss, but isn't ready for chapter books, like Bailey School Kids, here's the perfect bridging series. I have the whole Solo series and use it with nearly every child I teach. The stories are great, the books have short chapters so kids can feel proud to be on chapters, the illustrations are lovely. Solo Books have won awards, and deservedly so."
2,Don't Buy the DeLonghi XM5080 - Battery Fails in Few Months,"The DeLonghi XM5080 wet/dry vacuum cleaner might look nice and has some noticeable suction power but if the battery wears out in a few months, its not worth it at all. The battery runs out of juice in a few months to a level it cannot even pick up small pieces of debris. I tried getting a replacement under the 1-yr warranty but couldn't. DeLonghi is not customer oriented."
1,Piece of Junk Product,"Bought four of these because I like their floor heaters and expected a good product. The usage on all four combined is less than a few hours. They don't hold a charge. They don't have good suction. They are heavy, and now two of them do not even work. I have asked Delongi for my money back or replace them with something of quality. By first thought was to throw them in the trash, but I did pay about $140 for the four of them including shipping."
1,It stopped working after only 8 months!,"I thought I was going hi-tech getting this thing, but I'm back to using the low-end, no-name brand I thought I was replacing. I hardly used it, but in just a few months it went dead on me, although it says the battery is charged. I can't find the warranty, if there was one, and they have no website (though a page says, not in English, one is under construction) so I guess I'll just have to throw it out and buy something else."
1,Can't empty the dirt!,"The first time I used it, after only a few minutes of vacuuming, the suction was greatly reduced so I went to empty it. The dust/dirt got wedged in-between the cloth dust filter and the plastic cassette and it couldn't be shaken out, and there was no way to disassemble it to get the dirt out! Instead of just being able to shake the filter out and resume vacuuming, I had to rinse it out in the sink and give it a vigorous shake to get the dust/dirt to come out! The instructions say, ""Take hold of the permanent filter and knock out the dust."" No way!!! According to the instructions, the filter should be allowed to dry before vacuuming or the performance is reduced, so this caused further inconvenience. This is a terrible design! I cannot understand how DeLonghi could manufacture a product so poorly designed. I wanted a convenient way of vacuuming up a little dirt or pet hair, but instead I got more trouble than it was worth. I'm returning it."
4,"Works well, but loud and heavy","The Hand Vac picks up dirt great. It is loud, however, and it's good if you have a strong arm when you use it."
2,Missing Too Many Pages!,"I was so excited to see a re-print of this book so I ordered it immediately. Unfortunately, almost every single page in this ""re-print"" is completely blank. This is mostly a book of blank pages with an occasional printed page. There are only 19 pages in this book that aren't blank, it is such a disappointment! Some of the pages have a grey shadow on them like something was attempted to be copied and put on the page but nothing shows up. I would not have bought this product if I had known it would look like this and I don't think it was worth the price I paid."
3,Age of Reagan book,The book arrived in good condition but with no dust jacket. I assume all hardcovers to have a dust jacket unless stated so this was very disappointing.
4,Moments of Great Insight,"Over the top with rhetoric in some places, but jammed packed with incredible insights. Being 'moderate-left' this is not a book I would readily pick up, but was drawn to it by the memory of watching the 2000 presidential debates. Watching Gore describe how he would impliment a tax cut, lef tme thinking, ""We're still living in the age of Reagan"".The 1st 224 pages are the strongest. Hayward does an excellent job of weaving the various threads of the Liberal collapse of the 60s. Having been on campus at that time (Northwestern `69), I can attest to how the student movement both toyed with and split with the Black Panthers, but only after we had trashed our ties with organized labor and the Democratic Party. We lost blue collar America and have never gotten it back.Haywards liberal bashing gets overheated in some places, and the part on the `76 campaign drags. But overall, it's worth the price to add to your library."
1,Not a good product,"I bought a bottle of this pre-shave, and after 3 uses I can say it was a waste of money. I did not find it helped at all, in fact I think it made my shaving a little worse. My razor seems to pull the hair out rather than cut it. Razor works fine without product. Once you put it on, you have to wait until you clean your hands of the product or get it all over your razor. Poured the remainder down the drain.!"
5,Wonderful book for students and parents,"Want to be a winner on and off the field? This inspiring book by Elwood Scales III tells you how. The author uses Christian principles to impart lessons about being your best and living a life that makes you proud.Written in a way that lets you know he's been there, Scales infuses his book with history and anecdotes that share the hazards and joys of being a student athlete. He gives strategies for succeeding in the classroom, on the team and in life. An insightful book and must-read for student athletes and people who love them."
4,A NO MAKEUP LOOK WITH AN ADDED GLOW,"The beauty of Mally Visible Skin is that it makes imperfections invisible. Let's face it (pun intended), some days are better skin days than others. On good skin days this foundation can be used dry, providing a full yet very natural looking light coverage that simply allows you to put your best face forward.On those other days, times when skin needs a little extra TLC, apply the foundation wet. This will provide further coverage yet skin will still remain ultra natural in appearance. (Hint: apply with a damp, not wet sponge.)Either way Mally's fantastic foundation delivers a poreless, flawless finish, a no-makeup look with an added glow.As my skin is light my favorite shade is ""Fair."" Love the slim pink compact with large mirror and compartment for the included sponge puff - love what Mally does for skin!- Gail Cooke"
5,I love this,"I'm a temp leasing agent and I wear this makeup everyday. So easy to put on. Not cakey looking. I'm African American. I'm not too dark or too light. So it's hard to tell what will work or me or not. But when I put this makeup on, I got this in Rich, it really does blend into my skin and it really does ""visibly adjust"" to my skin tone and I look fresh and awake before going to work even when I've barely had sleep. It's a keeper, I must say."
1,I was rob,"It's probably an oversight on my part, but the movie was not in english. Really couldn't enjoy the movie"
1,where were the dinosaurs???,"well, as much as i appreciate the effort shown on Jet's part to do a wholesome kung fu documentary, i really must protest the total lack of dinosaurs. What the heck? you really can't expect a decent, God-fearing American to sit through hours of this mindless drivel when there are no dnosaurs present... honestly... Good kung fu, totally worthless special effects, the one lizard that i happened to notice looked like it was an iguana just chilling on the set, i mean, did they even want it to look like a dinosaur? Sometimes i think they didn't... that's how bad it was.Trust me, if you are looking for kung fu action without the dinosaurs, you're wasting your time. If you're not retarded and want some Rex Kwon Do, you know that you should be looking for some real action.yes this review was a joke. I'm bored. I haven't actually seen the documentary, but i'd like to."
4,Great stuff,"I love Namie! My favorite songs are Can't Sleep, Can't Eat; and Violet Sauce. Luckily you can get a number of her songs and singles on iTunes for a hell of a lot cheaper than this. Check it out."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I bought over ten GMAT prep books. This one has terrible questions and does not resemble actual tests. I did not bother to finish reading it. I would definitely suggest ets, princeton review, kaplan's, dummie's guide, and arco over this."
2,Peterson's Guide Leads GMAT CAT Test Takers Astray,"The Peterson's Guide has turned out to be a disappointment in helping me to study for the GMAT CAT. The most blarring problem with this study guide is that it repeatedly gives you advice on how to take the written GMAT, yet it promotes itself as the 1999 version. Perhaps Peterson's doesn't realize that the GMAT is now only offered on the computer (CAT) for students in the United States. I don't think the CAT test centers would appreciate it if I were to circle key words or phrases in the Reading Comprehension section, as the Peterson's Guide suggests.While the math review is sufficient and some of the suggestions are well-made, I've found that this information can be found in other study guides that will also focus on the GMAT CAT.If you can't decide, ""What is the author's tone in this passage"", I suggest that you look somewhere other than Peterson's Guide to find the answer."
2,DOG POO,The answers were arbitrary and capricious in many instances on verbal section. The math reviews are reasonable but less exhaustive than I wanted. MAth maybe a little to simple in general. The CD was garbage.
5,Never thought I'd buy toothbrushes online,"I can't find these at Walgreens, Walmart or Target anymore. This is terrible. I can't stand the tooth polisher toothbrushes that Colgate and other brands have now. This toothbrush brushes btwn the teeth!!!"
2,Disappointed!,"After using this toothbrush for only a week, I must say - don't bother! Here's why: a. `medium', not exactly... it's really harsh on your gums. Too much pressure and ... your gums are bleeding profusely. b. starts to look like a very old tiny broom you bought at Dollar General few years ago, right after three days of use. c. it has a good grip, really? Sorry, I haven't noticed that! Slipping out, like it's heavily oiled. My comparison's based onto my favorite Oral-B (full, medium), which is kinda pricey, but definitely worth it. I'll never buy this product again."
2,really awkward,"I love her voice and the drums are cool, but the music is so awkward. It sounds like she made it with Mario Paint (if anybody knows what I'm talking about). It has a very disjointed unorganized flow. My favorite track is #8 My B-Sides Rock Your World and that is only because of the trippy chorus ""hello boy."" If Miss Solex were to get herself educated on composition I believe she could craft a very nice tune."
3,not the best light,"should be known this light gets super hot ..so hot will melt the cheap screen they give you faster then you can get it out of the box. the light is also not as good as other lights, very small space light.. reallly didnt like it compared to the other lights i got ."
4,easy to use,These glue sticks do a good job holding foam strips together without melting or distorting them. Not much else to report.
5,baby jesus set,this toy is the first playmobil i had now i have a lot of them. it is fun playing the playmobil way. it is great for people who love jesus. it tells the story of baby jesus.
3,not for little ones,"this nativity scene was cut, realistic, but very intricate. the figurines had many very small parts, and clumsy little fingers could not manipulate."
2,Playmobile Nativity Set,The product was a little too flimsy for a child of 3-4. Easily broken and difficult for them to play with. Not the type I was anticipating.
4,Very cute - too many little pieces,I bought this set for our family. It is very cute and fun (you can even take beards & hair off) but there are too many little pieces to get lost and the pieces tip over easily.
5,wonderful toy,We set up this nativity every year! I was so pleased to see Playmobil made this available. it is good that my kids have a nativity they can play with and use to practice telling the Christmas story.Wonderful toy!
4,"Little Red Caboose Chug, Chug, Chug","As a child I loved the song Little Red Caboose. Now as a mother I am teaching this song to my two year old. We were delighted to find such a colorful and accurate book of all the train cars, including the red caboose. Now when my son sees a train, he immediately break out into song and wants to read his Little Red Caboose book. The book is excellent for teaching colors and the pictures are sure to delight very young readers. It is good to be able to tell a child about the way trains use to be."
3,Just What I wanted!,"I was looking for a ""best of CD,"" that didn't leave off one hit single and found it with this compilation. I don't like it when you are forced to choose between CD's because their is a great ""hit"" left off of one and placed on another. I am very satisfied with this purchase!"
3,More of the same,"I agree with Dana in her 2004 review of this disc. Why can't Sony/BMG realise how successful the three first Planet albums were, and give us more of them: Energy, Priority & Special Things. These were all excellent albums and deserve to be remastered and reissued as prime examples of The Pointer Sisters, who were more than just the sum of a dozen hit singles. Give us the classic albums as well, instead of this Chinese-water-torture technique of releasing a 'best of' CD with one non-charting album track. These ladies deserve better."
2,I wouldn't recommend this product. Chewing it was ...,"I wouldn't recommend this product. Chewing it was like chewing tin foil ... it left a metallic taste in my mouth. I chewed all of it, as directed on the package, in hopes of growing to like it - but, no luck. I could stand to chew it for only about 5 minutes but the taste got increasingly more metallic. The package says it cleans your teeth and freshens your breath, but any mint gum will do the same thing. I personally would prefer a tic-tac."
4,I really liked this gum; the only problem ...,"I really liked this gum; the only problem I had with it was the taste didn't last long. It cleaned my teeth very well. After I put it in my mouth, I could feel that my teeth were clean."
4,I liked the cool minty taste. It actually ...,I liked the cool minty taste. It actually tasted like real mint from the garden unlike the fake sugary mint of other mint gums I've tried. A real breath freshener. I'd recommend this to my friends and family.
3,Holds up relatively well,"It's exceedingly difficult for 80s cartoons to hold up once Father Time gets ahold of them (Garfield & Friends and Batman: TAS are among the best of the lot), and The Real Ghostbusters does well enough to justify a purchase of a few non-season DVDs. The price is right and it's convenient that you can grab a few episodes on DVD without having to plunk down over $100 for the upcoming full series set.Take a stroll down memory lane with Spooky Spirits or one of the other Ghostbuster releases, but the trip is short."
3,Good for its prize but Sony should release Complete Season Sets,"Ok,I know that buying this the studio will see if customers are interested in the show but Sony should make an effort and release complete seasons sets.Fans will buy more sets even if prize is higher.This Dvd has many flaws.No commentary or special features.Image quality is bad in some episodes.But has CC and I have bought similar Dvds with 2,3 o 4 eps that hasn't any(cheap transfer and unknown studios)that hasn't any and had a higher prize."
4,"great, but...","Sony just released these three discs to see if people would actually buy them, and i must say that this is great! i bought all three and am just waiting for the boxed sets to be released. Although there are no extras at all or subtitles (i love subtitles)i'd still recommend them and the boxed sets (if they come out anytime soon)."
4,Great Fun,"The storys are funny, spooky with a big dose of mystery thrown in. Doesn't get any better."
5,Good Size to take in the car but a little overpriced,This is a good item for keeping a leapster safe and sound.It also works well to help keep the leapster games all in one place since they are little and can have a tendency to get misplaced.Great carry along for the car and doesn't take up alot of space.I kept waiting to see if this item would ever go down in price and it never did. I think it is a good product but realistically I think a better price would be $10
4,Not a bad way to go,"My main problem with this bag is that it is easy to lose the games out of. Once you open the big or the small section they are just in there, not held down by anything. We've already lost one cartridge, but otherwise it is a great way to carry the Leapster around!"
2,It's the little things...,"I purchased two of these ""Backpacks"" for my children for Christmas this year. I was disappointed to see how SMALL these packs are. For the price ($19.99 each) I was expecting something much larger. But, I know my kids will be in the car a lot with them, and sets of headphones, so The extra storage for the wires and accessories should be nice. I'm wondering how well they will hold up to two 4 year olds though. My kids are real rough on stuff."
4,I'm Pleased,"I bought this back pack for my 4 year old grandson. I read the reviews on the other case for the regular Leapster and learned that other people were having a hard time finding a case for the L-Max since it would not fit.I did not want something really big, but big enough for the L-Max and some games.This is adequate in size but not too big and bulky. Everything fits. It works for us."
4,Really really really GOOD,The Burning was like wow!!! It got kind of annoying that Soren was ordering everyone around including his sister though.
3,A Book on Your Opinion,"Guardians of Ga'Hoole Book 6 The BurningA book on your opinionI chose this book because I have already read some of the authors books before in this series. I would rate this book a 3 out of 5. I would recommend this book for 8 and up. The first half of the book was a little bit boring. Then it starts to pick up. It talks about how the Guardians [Guardians the good owls] and the Pure Ones [Pure Ones are the bad owls] are planning an attack on each other. There in battle the Pure Ones leader Kludd gets killed. Who was the one to that killed him find out. This is when the story gets exciting. The main charters are Soren, Gylfie, Digger, and Twilight. If you like action or planning this is a book for you."
2,Bad Customer service outweighs the product,"I purchased one of these for my husband's birthday. Within a month and a half, he made 3 batches of rasberry sorbet and 2 batches of fresh peach ice cream but then blue gel started to ooze out of the seams of the machine. We sent it to Delonghi's Warrenty office in San Francisco and have not seen it since. That was over four months ago. If you are considering a Delonghi product, check out the website and you will see that the customer service is hidden. The irritating ambient music and graphics act as barriers to actually getting any information or finding a way to contact their customer service department. It is too bad, we liked the appliance when we first got it but because of the bad customer service, we will not purchase another Delonghi product."
5,Up All Night,"This Unwritten Law single contains the song ""Up All Night,"" from their upcoming album ""Elva,"" to be released on 1/29/01. This album also contains two other tracks, ""Darkside"" and a demo version of a song, neither of which is on UL's upcoming album ""Elva."" This is definately a single worth getting as you'll receive a great song and two more unreleased songs from Unwritten Law. A must buy for Unwritten Law fans!"
1,boring for middle school,"I teach sixth grade Social Studies. this video is not engaging enough for my students. The narrator has a thick English accent which right there tunes out my kids, also the camera is just pointing on art work . Not interesting .I expected much more."
2,Ancient Greece Traditions of Greek Culture,This is not a film an educator would want to show in a classroom too graphic. Informational not educational.
3,romancing mister brigerton,"it took them so long to send me the book i thought i was not going to get it, just like once before and i had already gone to the book store and had them order it (hastings). i got both the old book and the new one from the book store on the same day. i had waited 21/2 weeks before i went to the book store to order and i got both just last week. considering i paid as much for the shipping cost as i did for the book for this lady and i think i should have gotten the book within a week"
2,Love Julia Quinn but............,Her mistake here was making Penelope Lady Whistledown. It overwhelmed the book and took away from the romance. The byplay between both characters on a personal level was lacking as Lady Whisteldown overwhelmed most of their conversations. Still think she is a great writer but this one should have been edited a little bit more.
1,Rrrrrrip -- is that a bodice I hear?,"Snore. The fun of Regency romances is their structure -- no sex, a significant economic reason why the heroine had better find a mate, a flawed hero ... not this 21st century superimposition of sexual desire (and relief), a financially independent heroine, and a perfect (athletic, handsome, tall, shapely, well-spoken, intellectual, did I mention handsome, tall, shapely?) hero. Skip this book unless you really just want to read about another perfect initial sexual encounter nominally staged two hundred years ago."
3,The Weakest Link,"To me, this book is the weakest and least imaginative of the delightful Bridgerton series so far (I'm reading in order.) The plot doesn't seem to advance- it more gets a repeated rehash every few chapters (with a slightly different spin) followed by a sudden resolution at the book's end. I was disappointed, in part because of the high expectations I've developed for this author. It felt like I was reading filler for a good part of the book. I wasn't captivated; I felt instead that I just got through it to get to the next book and I grew somewhat bored at various points in the book. Due to the revelation of a mysterious character's identity in this volume, you may want to leave this one to the last if you plan to finish the series.Decent enough reading, but I'd check out others by this author to get a far better example of her capabilities."
2,Do not read this book in series,If you read this book in the series first you will not want to read the other books in the series. Too much time communicating about previous present feelings and emotions. I thought the book did not live up to it's title. Very little romance or excitement until the end of the book. This book should be removed from the series.
5,"The best of the Bridgertons...Good work, Julia Quinn","I'd waited a long time to read this, and thought it was Quinn's best yet. The sub plot of discovering the identity of Lady Whistledown allow Penelope ""The Wallflower"" Featherington and Colin ""The Charmer"" Bridgerton to discover themseves... and each other.Fast paced, witty dialogue had me laughing out loud, and some beautiful moments(especially the ball scene at the end) had me tearing up. This was different and better than some of the other things Quinn has written becuase of the careful, believable and just plain old excellent characterization.This book isn't as ""fluffy"" (sorry, Mz. Quinn) as some of her other work.I have to admit, though, I was a little sad that Lady Whistledown is no more. But that won't stop me from reading more-I eagerly await Eloise's story.I reccomend checking out the other Bridgerton books, especially ""How to Marry a Marquis"" and ""How to Catch an Heiress""."
3,Very cute...but not a romantic love story...,"I really liked this book from the start. Loved Penelope!!!! However it really isn't a very sensual or romantic story. I thought the chemistry between Penelope and Colin was really lacking.Still love Julia Quinn!!! ""How to marry a Marquis"", ""Dancing at midnight"" and ""Splendid"" are my favorites!!! And much better than this one."
5,a refeshing change!,"I've been waiting, ever so patiently for this novel, and I was not disapointed!I loved the turn of emotions in Colin as he began to see Penelope in a romantic light after having befriended her for years. Their emotional adventures together was wonderful!It was very refreshing to finally met a heroine that was not the picture of absolute beauty. Let's be honest, most of us woman are not what society depicts as ""perfect"" as many of the heroines in romance novels seem to be. I loved watching her finally see her dreams come true and the man that she's cared for for so many years finally return her love, and to hell with looking perfect! It was great.Thanks Julia for another wonderful adventure!!"
4,Another fun addition to the Bridgerton Family,"I loved that this story included the poor Penelope from the previous books, I loved her quick wit and kindness and it is really showcased in this book. It is also nice to really get to know the fun loving rake Colin and see the depth of his character. Their story is one I will save."
5,Oh Colin!,"Colin is and always will be our favorite Bridgerton...and I've loved Penelope from the start!Highly recommended...A must read..so if you haven't read this one yet, read this today! It's a treat!"
3,Not the best Quinn,"Julia Quinn is always a top notch romance author. So this book is still 3 stars, all in all, however this was not my favorite book. I never felt connected to the characters and I think too much emphasis was placed on the Lady Whistledown plot line. Penelope was an interesting character, but Colin felt a little flat and never rose to the 'greatness' that Penelope constantly attributed to him. He just didn't seem worthy of her adoration."
5,Romancing Mister Bridgerton,"This is the best Whistledown novel out! Penelope, Eloise, Hyancinth, Felicity, Lady Bridgerton, and of course Colin make this book. It makes you laugh, cry and laugh some more. The characters really do come alive in this Julia Quinn novel."
4,My First Julia Quinn Novel,"I read this book after surfing Amazon one day for my favorite author Nora Roberts. Someone had a wish list or something and mentioned that they loved Nora Roberts and Julia Quinn. I then went to [a bookstore] where they were having a buy 4 get 1 free sale. As my free book, I picked up this one. Suffice it to say, I was not dissappointed. This book was just plain fun! I read it in no time. I admit, it did get a bit slow towards the end, but I still liked it. I feel that the good parts, made up for the slower parts. After reading this book, I went out and bought Anthony's novel, which I shall review later. After reading the reviews on this book, however, I must say I am even more excited to get her other books, since this one does not seem to be her most popular by any means."
5,Romancing Mister Bridgerton,"Julia Quinn hit her stride on books 3 and 4, then she lost it. Romancing Mr. Bridgerton was great. I've always thought Colin was the best Bridgerton because he has his hands in everybody's business. He was probably the most fully developed of the series. P.S. I knew who Lady W. was since book 2."
3,Disappointed,This story started out so wonderfully than it just crashed. Once the characters were married all the sizzle seemed to end.
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I have been waiting for this book for months on end, but Julia Quinn, this time around, did not deliver. There was a decided lack of emotiveness, feeling, chemistry, call it what you will, on either Colin's or Penelope's part, especially Colin's. He appeared to go with the flow of the idea of being in love, and even after declaring his love, there was no that sense of well being one gets after reading a scene that is supposed to move you. For those who are reading JQ's book for the first time, then it can be passably good, but having read her earlier books, like the _Duke and I_, _Dancing At Midnight_, this one was terrible. Just to be generous 2 stars will suffice because it's JQ but otherwise......"
2,Not as good as the first three in the Bridgerton series...,"This is my first experience reading Julia Quinn's novels. I started with the first book in the Bridgerton series, The Duke and I, and I was hooked. I truly enjoyed the first three in this series and couldn't wait to read Colin's story. I loved Colin's character in the first three books. I was so looking forward to reading a novel that included Colin's happy-go-lucky & charming disposition, but instead we got someone completely different? His character was nothing like the first three books. He was bitter, jealous and angry? I was so disappointed. I thought it would be refreshing to have a hero that is charming and not so brooding. Penelope was weak and I really could care less about her character. The romance was not believable between these two characters.Since I enjoyed the first 3 books, I will continue the series only b/c I don't think it could get any worse than Romancing Mister Bridgerton."
3,"Good, But Not Her Best Book","I rushed out to buy this book the day it was released, because Julia Quinn's are usually the most reliably well-written romances. However, I found this one to be someone draggy - the first fifty pages will bore anyone already familiar with the Bridgerton family - and lacking in a ""momentum event"" (ie, stangers meet, a death occurs, etc). Penelope, with her long-unrequited love for the selfish dilettante Colin, and her submission to her abusive mother, comes across as a doormat/drip. I look forward to the next book in the series, which will feature the (much more dynamic) heroine, Eloise Bridgerton."
4,Good Read,"I have enjoyed all of the previous Bridgerton novels, when I heard that Colin was going to be paired with Penelope, I thought how odd. It works! All of the Bridgerton stories have been highly enjoyable. Lady Whistledown is finally unmasked, what a surprise. I enjoyed interaction between Penelope and Colin. The book added greatly to my appreciation of Julia Quinn's work. Every lady should have a life's work."
3,not sensual enough,"everything else is pretty good. i actually like this one better that the viscount who loved me. but it has the same problems for me,which is that just too much talking and not enough sexual tension. and the sexual scenes are not sexy enough."
2,Boo-Hoo,"I waited and waited and was so excited when this book arrived...but the excitement was quickly forgotten. The story line is not good. I believe the writer could have done a much better work. In the beginning of the book the heroine ""Penelope"" is soft-spoken, shy, and has low self-esteem. Then all of a sudden she decides midpoint in the book that she shouldn't be this way..then it's like she changes out of nowhere. She starts to be outspoken and seeing that she is valuable. Nothing is wrong with this of course but it just wasn't believable.The hero ""Colin"" was way too nice. It was almost as if he was perfect. Nobody's perfect. I think the story line would have been better if he was a little bit more mean to her.Bottom line...out of all the Bridgerton series....this one has to be the worst."
3,only so-so,"Well, I liked all the aspects of friendship before love etc. But overall I think it dragged in places and I found myself waiting to get done with this book."
2,Romancing Mr. Bridgerton,"Was so looking forward to another great Quinn novel, and was so very disappointed. Just not her usual wit and banter. Found it rather lacking, which is a FIRST for one of her novels. I've read them all, and have loved them all, except for this one."
3,(what's with the parentheses)?,"I've read a few of Julia Quinn's books and they're pretty good. This one was OK. A decent read. I did skip parts trying to get to the sections where the hero/heroine would interact. The romance was just lukewarm. I did enjoy the ONE love scene though. There just seems to be something missing from certain books that would take it from being just good, to great. This book seemed to be more focused on the secondary story of unmasking Whistledown than to the budding relationship of Penelope and Colin."
3,Not her best work but must have for Bridgerton fans,"Not her best work, some parts were kinda ho~hum, but like I said still a pretty good read and a must have for any Bridgerton family fans!"
2,Very Disappointed!!!,"Not her best at all!! I even re-read her 3 other Bridgerton books to prepare myself for this new one, and after laughing and crying through the other 3, I had to force myself to finish this one. Colin was a one dimentional character who never really fell in love, and was always whining about something. I'm not appreciated! I'm not good enough!! Everybody loves me but doesn't know me! Shut up!! And Penelope! I thought she was one tough cookie, but everytime Colin kissed her, she's be this empty headed little girl who forgave him for everything! I would give it one star, but I'm not that heartless."
5,Wow!! What a great book!,"This book was fantastic!! I've read all of the books in the Bridgerton series, so when I saw this novel on the shelf in my local Wal-Mart, I promptly bought it, went home, and read for the next three hours. I couldn't have enjoyed my time more. Although the other books in the series were good, I think this latest installment was pure perfection. If Julia Quinn can top this novel, I'll be camped outside my local Wal-Mart for the next release!!I would like to warn would-be readers, that although the author does a good job of making this a stand alone story, I think you'll have a lot more fun reading this book if you've read the rest of the books in the series. Ms. Quinn does a wonderful job of seamlessly fitting in characters from previous books, and it's a shame not to know their backgrounds before you read this book. Most authors can't accomplish this smoothly, and she does a remarkable job of tying everything together.Yeah, Julia!!!! Keep them coming!"
3,"Okay . . . but not a page-turner, stay-up-all-night book","I'm surprised by all the five-star reviews. This is a fair read. Colin and Penelope are engaging characters and it *is* fun to read about them again. However, the book drags down in so many places I found myself wondering if publishers don't hire editors anymore. Really, some of the conversations re. Lady Whistledown's identity and Colin's angst over a lack of purpose were plain insipid."
3,Almost....,"I really wanted Penelope and Colin to get together, and I adore the Bridgerton family. I re-read parts in other books just because they make me laugh. While the Bridgerton family was in full force throughout this book, it seemed replayed. Colin's trauma just semed like a replay of Benedict's problems. The way the relationship with Penelope and Colin moved, was a little flat as well. I expected something like the other three books, origianl and witty. Instead, Colin randomly seems to decide he loves Penelope. Their conversations are interesting, but their romance is not. Plus, frankly, Lady Whistledown was a let down. I think Ms. Quinn could have made it more creative. I will definitely read more books by her, and pre-order the next Bridgerton book. But I was most definitely dissapointed"
5,Wonderful Romance,"The story of Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton is a delightful one. I liked the fact that Penelope is different from most heroines and Colin is a wonderful hero. The lack of love scenes was not even noticed by me until I read some of the reviews here. Colin and Penelope's relationship develops through actions and dialogue in such a way that the reader can understand why these two are made for each other. I'll take Quinn's masterful dialogue over thrown in love scenes any day. In a lot of romances, authors make the mistake of replacing deep and meaningful conversation with love scenes to explain why the hero and heroine are in love. This story is funny and enjoyable and the reader is not left wondering whether or not the two main characters are in love or lust. It is obvious Penelope and Colin are head over heels in love!"
3,"It should have been titled ""Discovering Lady Whistledown""","After reading the reviews on this book I had to comment. I think that Julia spent way too much time on Lady Whistledown, and not enough on the ROMANCE between Colin and Penelope. I waited patiently for this book, and only gave it three stars because it's a Quinn. Because unrequited love is something most of us can identify with, we want more than just ""the wedding was magical-and the wedding night-well, that was magical,too"" (page 298)We want DETAILS, Julia! Where's the ROMANCE?? How could you gloss over such an important part of the story-the culmination of Penelope's infatuation of many years? I hope that Eloise's story is more like the Quinn I know and love."
4,I Laughed on the First Page!,I buy her books sight unseen. This may not be the BEST Bridgerton story but it is still Great. I laughed on the first page and did not stop. Penelope and Colin's story is great. They both have known each other for ages and Penelope has loved him since she was 16. Now she is 28 and he is 33 and things just come together and they see each other how they really are. This was a fun story and the characters were great. You get to see all kinds of old friend and family and see how they have been changing and growing. You do not want to miss this one. And oh you get to find out who Whistledown is. I won't tell you who since that is half the fun of reading the story!
2,Disappointment,"Julia Quinn is one of my favorite authors, and I was anxiously awaiting this book. Unfortunately Romancing Mister Bridgerton was truly disappointing. Colin and Penelope's story could have been so much better, but it was trite and forced. One had to wonder what these characters saw in each other. Not that they were unlikable, but they were an unlikely couple. They lacked chemistry, the story lacked conflict - simply put, the book lacked the creativity and humor of Ms. Quinn's previous novels."
5,Julia Quinn keeps getting better!!!,"I don't consider myself an expert on literary matters, but I read A LOT of romance novels (mostly regencies), and I LOVED this book. Books in a series do not always live up to the anticipation, but Colin and Penelope's story surpassed my expectations.Colin is just the sweetest thing! I love how different from his brothers he is. It is obvious that Julia Quinn becomes immersed in her characters and story lines because this book, the fourth Bridgerton story, shows that the entire series was thought out to perfection.Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series is now at the TOP of my list with Stephanie Lauren's Cynsters and Johanna Lindsey's Malorys. I will eagerly await Eloise's story in early 2003, because I know that I won't be disappointed..."
2,This one definitely dragged....,"I've read the other Bridgerton romances, and found this one completely uninspiring. Naturally, having met 'poor Penelope' in the other stories (I tried to read them in order), I could not get excited about her finding love, finally. I also got a little tired of the 'this son doesn't have the title but he does have a fat purse, engaging smile, yadda yadda.' I kept wanting to shout, 'Get on with it!' This is the first one I've put down without finishing. It's still not finished, and has been relegated to a certain room in my house. The ultimate book insult."
3,Whole lotta NOTHIN goin' on!,"Julia Quinn, whose books I usually adore, has written a whole lot of nothin' in Romancing Mr. Bridgerton. I've followed all the Bridgertons from Daphne to Benedict and enjoyed their charming, hilarious romances. Here we have the perfect foils: adorable, smart Penelope Featherington and handsome, charming Colin Bridgerton. As characters, they are as endearing as Daphne and Simon & Kate and Anthony. But NOTHING HAPPENS!! Page after page of inane dialogue that goes nowhere. No plot, no action, no purpose. Even ""comedy"" scenes, where the characters end up falling all over the floor in hysterical laughter failed to elicit a smile from my lips. Come on, Julia - you can do MUCH better than this!!"
1,Boring,"This is a story of a 33 year old man who has traveled the world, and a 28 year old woman who has been in love with him since she was 17. That is about all the importance given us as the reader to the hero? and heroine? From there on we could get out the crayons and coloring paper. This would be good reading for my 5 year old and she would be bored I am sure. What tripe!!!!!! And I hate that I paid good money for it. No love, no romance, no humor and no time to waste on garbage."
3,Disappointed!,"After reading The Duke and I, I had high hopes for this book. I thought it would be a great story after I read the introduction. However, the main characters lack chemistry and I just wasn't excited about them. It was just dull. It's still a decent book, however,not a keeper."
2,Dull and disappointing,"Truly a snore. Good god, nothing exciting happens. Nothing really happens at all! The dialogue is flat and lame. A lot of fluffy polite conversations about nothing. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. However, the greatest disappointment is that we FINALLY discover who the notorious Lady Whistledown is (a big plot in this book) and THAT character is at best, anemic and bland. She's not remotely believable as the wickedly sharp, funny, insightful, intelligent, mischevious Lady Whistledown. It does not do that mysterious and saucy character justice. The story of Lady Whistledown had such tremendous potential, but it falls miserably flat. A horrible disappointment. Lazy story telling. What a waste.P.S. the hero of this story isn't particularly exciting either."
2,Sweet Valley High!,"I LOVE Julia Quinn, and I think she's a talented, funny writer. Having said that, I don't think I should FORCE myself to finish this book. If I didn't know the quality writing Julia is capable of, maybe I would like this... not sure.The beginning reminded me of all those Sweet Valley High books I read as a (very!) young girls (and if you read them too, you know just what I'm talking about) where the 2 main characters (twins Elizabeth and Jessica) were described in the same way, and the first chapter was the same in all 100+ books. Ms. Quinn actually includes a LOT from the prior her earlier books- it feels more like filler than background or perspective. And I have NO idea why Colin is falling in love with Penelope. It just doesn't work. But I love Julia, and I'll be back for the next book! I guess that means I should finish this one (groan- homework!)"
5,So brilliant!,"There is something very personable about Penelope and Colin. That Colin doesn't know what to do with his life isn't a usual dilemma the hero faces, but I understand that about him so well! That contrast in Penelope, at once self-doubtful about herself because she's a spinster and also so strong and certain as a friend/writer/sister is soo endearing and admirable. This is all made possible because Quinn is a hilarious writer and develops her characters well. It's a lovely story about a friendship that develops into a love. And that scene on the balcony in the end has to be the most cleverly written, wonderfully romantic, hilariously dramatic scenes of all time! :)"
3,This book felt like it was difficult to write.,"Was Romancing Mr. Bridgerton well-written? Sure. Was it pleasant? Absolutely. Ms. Quinn always writes well, and her characters are witty and charming. Unfortunately, all the witty turns-of-phrase and arch glances in the world can't make up for an obvious lack of inspiration."
5,A delightful read,"Julia Quinn has done it again. ROMANCING MR. BRIDGERTON is an enchanting read. I love Penelope and Colin. They are so perfect for each other. I love the fact that Colin seems to have everything and need nothing but discovers that he needs Penelope. The unveiling of Lady Whistledown adds a fun twist and I love the love scene with Penelope and Colin. It is one of the nicest and most sensual, without being over the top.This is a wonderful, feel good read that you won't be able to put down. Thank you Julia. I can't wait for Eloise's story coming early 2003."
4,Fun Summer Read,"Another great read from Julia Quinn just in time for summer reading! As always, I love the characters with their usual humor and engaging dialogue."
2,A Lousy Bridgerton Tale,"I hate to rain on the parade, but this book was just plain lousy! Quinn introduced us to Colin in previous novels but even his charm couldn't save this disaster.It was a pleasure reading the other Bridgerton novels (Daphne, Benedict & Francesca's stories so far), but I had to struggle to get through this one. Colin and Penelope's romance took a back seat to the entire ""ton"" trying to figure out who that irritating Whistledown woman was. To me, Mrs. Whistledown was the most irritating force in all the books!"
3,Not a great one!,"As the other reviewers profess, I too, was quite disappointed with this novel and the character development. The identity of Lady Whistledown was highly unbelievable and while I was surprised, I didn't like who Julia chose to be Whistledown. It just didn't work. As for Colin, he's the worst brother in the family. The other brothers were fantastic and had great personalities; however, Colin's problems with his writing and being horrible to Penelope was bogus. That part of the book was awful and just dragged on. Penelope should have shot him. All in all, I would only recommend this book because it's a part of the series, but you certainly don't need to read it to continue with Eloise."
2,So much for expectations.,"I have read all of Quinn's books on the Bridgerton family and have become a fan of hers as a result. This book was a long time coming and perhaps I've expected it to be the best of all the 'Bridgerton series'. Sad to say, I was disappointed with what I've read. I found Colin falling in love with Penelope too sudden and the chemistry between them lacking. It was as if the book's only purpose was to unveil Lady Whistledown and to let Colin find a partner like the rest of his siblings. These two characters seemed more interesting when they were mentioned as supporting characters in other Bridgerton books."
2,Tepid!,"This was not one of her better books! The romance was tepid, the love scenes....what love scenes? Colin is a shallow little boy with a ""poor pitiful me"" attitude and Penelope is well, to put it nicely, BORING!! There was very little chemistry between the two and what was there was room temp. at best. This one is definitely not a keeper on my shelf."
5,This book was great considering I want a pet also!,I really want a pet and I relate to these kids because they couldn't have a pet also. Now I have a hamster and am working on getting a dog or a cat now!!!!!I really loved this book[it is my FAVORITE book]so I definately recommend it to everyone from ages 1-100.
3,An OK book,"I thought the book was okay. It was cool how you could see everything from one of the kid's view. I didn't like the chapters about the littler kids, Jan and Ira very much."
4,Great kids' book!,"The Rosso family includes 10 kids, but no pets...because, their mother says, that many kids is enough for any household. Despite her stubbornness, the Rosso kids are just as stubborn, and determined to get a pet of their own.Each chapter is told from the POV of a different Rosso kid, from 14-year-old Abbie to six-year-old Jan. For those who grew up familiar with Martin's Baby-Sitters Club series, the happy, noisy Rosso clan is a bit reminiscent of the eight-child Pike family...Overall, a light, but enjoyable read."
1,Didn't last long at all - terrible!,"This product worked fine at the start but after one summer if failed to work properly. The handle when depressed would only let out a little amount of water. After some adjustment, taking apart the nozzle and configuring it the thing still didn't work. The spray adjuster in the front fell off so I screwed it back on but it still gets loose. The rear adjustment screw doesn't work at all now and it is impossible to maintain water flow. It is in the garbage because it won't work at all. JUNK!"
1,Copy-Protected?!?,"Don't misunderstand... I have absolutely no desire to make a copy of any of the material on this disc. That having been said, I was rather put off (to say the least) upon receiving this disc after eagerly awaiting its release, only to note the tiny ""Copy-Protected"" icon on the back --- right next to the Sony label. Given Sony's rootkit fiasco with their CD's, I'm debating whether even to open the shrinkwrap, whether or not simply to return it to Amazon. Yes, Amazon mentions RCE prominently in the description of this release, but nowhere do they say that this disc features copy protection.Other than that, I'm unable to do a cognizant review, since I'm afraid to play the blasted thing. If it weren't for that, I might give this a higher rating (I love the series)."
1,Season Three is Unrecognizable,"NewsRadio Seasons One and Two are on a par with the best sitcoms ever to air on broadcast television.Season Three took all the original wit and intelligent writing out of the show and replaced it with wacky, staged gags. I'm interested to know who or what changed behind the scenes between Seasons Two and Three. Whoever is responsible for this hideous makeover deserves a beating. I hope the show came to it's senses before it went off the air, although I bet that never happened.If you loved NewsRadio Seasons One & Two steer clear of these episodes."
3,"They phoned it in (the extras, at least)","I am a big Newsradio fan. But in what you expect from a DVD in terms of extras, this third season DVD is far inferior to the DVD for the first two seasons. There are only commentaries for 10 of the 25 episodes; the first DVD had 20 commentaries for 29 episodes. But the quality of the commenatries has completely collapsed. Most are just rambling messes. Quite often, the commentators have no idea about which episode they're commenting on. In one case, Maura Tierney has to be contacted by phone for her contribution. Of course, she can't even see what she's commenting on so someone has to describe it to her. The first DVD's commentary sounded like the participants cared about the program. You don't get that sense of pride in this DVD. And that's a real shame because Newsradio deserves better than these throwaway commentaries."
5,great stuff,"this is such a great show, i miss watching it and am glad to have this in my collection. i highly recommend getting this show."
1,Completely Dissatisfied,"I ordered 3 fans at one time. All 3 are noisey and move no air. All in all, they are worthless."
3,"Fine as mechanical pencils go, but...","I like the feel and action of the Dixon Ticonderoga Sensematic better. Unfortunately, the 0.5mm version of that is no longer made, but the 0.7mm is here:Dixon Ticonderoga 99995 Dixon Ticonderoga SenseMatic Plus Mechanical Pencil, #2, 0.7 mm, SR, 5/Pk"
1,Don't buy,Bought this to house my daughter's new L-Max...cheap fabric and no padding. Any kid's backpack will work better than this one for the L-Max.
3,Average Bag,Looks better online than when it arrived. I purchased my son a blue bag that was shown next to this one and it is much better quality. The straps are a little too big for a Preschooler..
3,Very cute but poor quality!!,"I saw pictures of this backpack & thought it very cute..I was right, it is cute...however, it is not worth the money. I was very, very disappointed in the quality..the inside is almost paper thin. Shame on Leapfrog for making such a poor product to hold such an awesome thing as the Leapster....Note: the ""3"" stars is because it is cute & my granddaughter loves it."
1,Not worth the money!,"Cheaply made. Hardly and padding and nothing to secure the cartridges. Considering the cost of a leapster and the games, LeapFrog could have done better on the backpack."
3,Cute but doesn't fit our mattress,"It matches the bedding, but was too long (deep?) for the bed. Maybe we have a shorter box spring or the legs of the bed frame were shorter than average. I just pinned it to the boxspring to make it sweep the floor."
3,The Aim baking soda gel toothpaste was okay. ...,"The Aim baking soda gel toothpaste was okay. However, I still prefer the Colgate Total paste I normally use. Aim didn't have the easy flip top and didn't make my teeth feel as clean as Colgate. The minty taste was pretty good. Also, the price seems reasonable. I'd recommend it to friends who like gel toothpaste. As for me, I'll stick with my Colgate."
3,I've never used Aim toothpaste before. My teeth ...,"I've never used Aim toothpaste before. My teeth didn't feel as clean as with other toothpaste I've used. It didn't make my mouth feel fresh after use. Although, it went on to my toothbrush easily, I wouldn't recommend this to friends or family. I did like the packaging, but the toothpaste was just so-so."
4,Laugh-out-Loud Funny,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How could you not laugh out loud when he describes breaking the skull of his blind aunt (sounds sick, I know, but taken in context...). I recommend this book to anyone who needs a light read. I think this book is quite good."
2,Eh,"Eh? It was interesting but not a book I would recommend unless you are fascinated by the author through his other endevours. I just find it all a bit confusing and jumbled and there just didn't seem to be much of a point to the book. It was kind of like reading a [...] teens journal and seemed to just be a string of unrelated events that really didn't tie together for me.There are better ""autobiography"" type books out there, I would pass on this one."
1,Sub Par,"I found this book to be sorely lacking. The writing is purple prose, at best. The author's search for fabulousness is incredibly shallow, and this really comes through in the book. The tone of the book-superficial and supercilious-tends to repel the reader,rather than draw them in. I wish the author had dug deeper. I really didn't find it that funny at all."
5,They've done it again!,"How can Faith Massive continue to put out the high quality sounds on each track? Well once again, they have! If you want to call it Ambient Drum and Bass you can.... Now if you want to call it Smooth Jazz Drum and Bass you can. Faith Massive does things slightly different for 2 tracks on this CD. The beautiful song called ""Shelter"" sounds as if it came right out of smooth jazz radio. Fortunately, they do things just as well with this style as they do for D&B(Drum and Bass). The song called ""Eternity"" is another favorite of mine. This song is of more traditional D&B. You know what? There's nothing I can say that even remotely comes close to negative for this CD. These guys are simply awesome and their work proves that! From Track one to Track ten, it's a masterpiece!"
5,Awesome- buy this album!,This is it! You will not regret purchasing this album. It will soothe your mind and shake your tail at the same time!Highly recommended!
5,I started liking D&B again,"This cd changed my opinion on d&B music. i used to think of it as a little boring and too hardcore, and than i found this CD that has nice sounds and creativity. it has a positive Spirit that takes you into a personal journey. it's a nice Cd for atmosphere, play in your room at night, and some of it is even more for the crowds. VERY SPECIAL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and I'am glad these people are also Brothers in CHRIST. Halelu_YA!"
1,The most idiotic button setup ever.,"Hey! Let's make it so that you can conveniently remove the water tank and fill it at the sink, then reattach it.Hmm. We need a button to do that.....let's put the button EXACTLY where you press down with the palm of your hand when you're ironing! Yeah! So when you're pressing hard to get a stubborn wrinkle out, the water tank pops off!Please, please, buy a different iron. This iron is lovely, it works wonderfully, but I have had to cover the button with a plastic cap to keep myself from depressing it while ironing. I'm too stingy to buy another iron, but maybe I can save you the trouble. :)"
2,Overpriced UNDERPERFORMER,Bought a dozen and just had the last one fail for use in a motion sensor. It worked for 6 weeks. Some of the others lasted 3-4 months. Other batteries that cost far less have lasted 4-6 months in the same motion sensor. Look elsewhere for a 9V.
4,Great Gift!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. The ring is sturdy and very nicely made, especially for this price. I was impressed as soon as I opened the package. Plus, my boyfriend loved the ring and has worn it every day since Christmas."
4,very nice,"It's a very nice and heavy ring, and the cut out design is very cool. Because it's silver the details on the lines aren't as sharp as they could be, but it gives it a hand made feel."
5,PLAY is the Best!!!,"I've been a fan of Namie's for years and this is her best hip pop album to date! Her hip pop style has been infused with electronic beats that make every track unique & addicting. Very danceable beats, even with the slower Baby Don't Cry. A must-have for fans!"
3,"Namie Amuro ""Play ""","Namie Amuro is one of my favorite Japanese singers. When this new album came out I couldn't wait to put it in my cd player and give it a listen. The longer I listened to the CD,the more I realised she was copying (maybe unintentionally) Janet Jackson!!! Many of the songs (not all of them) have the same type of style and background harmonies that are identical to Janet. All and all the album isn't bad-in fact if you pretend it is a new Janet Jackson album you will really like it!Having been a Namie Amuro fan for many years (I have all her cds), I have to say this is my least favorite. The songs are pleasant enough to listen to but are nothing really special. (SORRY NAMIE!!!)One exception is ""Baby Don't Cry"". This song is surperb!"
2,Ugh,"I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it. The plot is boring, the characters are offensive, and although some find the main heroine ""sassy"" I just found her irritating and crass. The overall book is lacking in depth or structure. Awful - just awful."
4,Funny and not condescending,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said it took a while to get into this book, but once I got past the slow start, I really got to like these characters. Yeah, I knew from the get-go who was involved in the murder, but that didn't detract from the enjoyment of the book. I'd like to see more from this author regarding these characters.What I particularly appreciated was the way the author resisted making the trailer park residents stereotypical ""white trash"". Instead she showed the various types that live in a park like this, mostly because it's cheaper than rent or a house."
4,Oldie but still a goodie...,This is a great cd for someone that likes the old gospel songs and country music. My grandmother recently passed away and she absolutely adored this cd - it brought her much joy.
4,Merle's Gospel Album is a Pearl!,"I have always loved the deep tones of Merle's voice, to hear it praising God and portraying the even deeper truths about the God of the universe was a real thrill for me!"
3,Haggard Gospel CD,"Well, this CD wasn't what I expected but it's a keeper. I'd rate this CD as mediocre."
4,total harmonic distortion,"i first heard of these guys on the enchantments compilation on cleopatra records and after a long time searching for this found it on amazon.even though they are american it sounds like they could be from canada or europe .best songs are 1 and 9.if your a fan of skinny puppy ,front line assembly ,etc i would highly recommend this cd."
4,"If you still use standard cassettes, this is the unit to get.","As far as I know, it is pretty much the only standard cassette voice recorder with a sliding recording switch, so if you need one, this is it, you either buy it or go with microcassette or digital.Pros: Built like a tank, easy to hold and operate, has all the features you would need in a dictaphone.Cons: A bit on the bulky side - this is standard cassette, after all. Battery life could be better - I would definitely suggest a set of rechargeable batteries. Does not come with an AC adapter - you'll have to buy it separately if you need one.Bottom line: standard tape is kind of an anachronism in this day and age, but if your office still uses that for transcription, this is the best one out there."
3,Re-recordings,The familiar hit songs you see on the track list aren't the original versions -- they're re-recordings.
1,songs wont play .just a few just like the other one didi,"it has also quit,now i have two thatjust want work,i just want to sendthem both back. and hope i canit somewere else."
3,Lasted Only A Few Days,"The crystals were very pretty, and I loved it on my ankle and the ease of getting it on and off; however, it caught slightly on a chair and broke instantly, so caution is needed when wearing."
2,pretty but broke after two days when i was taking my pants off!,i liked it when it came but did not last. u need to be very careful with it if you want it to last
4,"good workout, but not as fun as originals","This is a tough, sweaty workout, and a lot of fun. However, the enthusiasm that made the originals so motivating and engaging seems to have disappeared. Blanks is still his outgoing self, but his disciples aren't near as energetic as those from the original vhs set. Nobody answers with screams or counts except for that poor girl with the perm and the awesome abs, so she comes off as annoying because she's the only one getting into it. If I were the director, I would have ordered a reshoot and given them all some RedBull. Also, I think the workout was a bit easier, probably as a result of the complaints of health professionals that some of his original workouts were not so good on the joints (if people didn't warm up or follow the instructional video properly). All in all, it was a fun variation, but I'm going to find a vhs player so that I can do the old tapes."
1,LAME!,I've been doing tae Bo for 15 years. This DVD is slow and boring. It never gets going. For a beginner it may be a good intro but don't expect results. I recommend tae Bo get ripped advanced. It's old but good. Also the original tae Bo advanced VHS is a classic that still rocks. This DVD is a waste of $$$
5,Tae-Bo Live! Better than Original,"After having purchased the Original Tae-Bo VHS series from the late 90s, I decided to try the Tae-Bo Live VHS series, and I have not been disappointed! I skipped right over the Instructional and went straight into doing the Basic workout. The Basic Live workout is far better than the original and TO ME, it's a very good, solid, FUN workout. The music is better (at least to me), and Billy mixes up the moves quite a bit. Those speed bag routines are MOIDER on my arms but highly effective in getting results!I believe I did the Advanced workout ONCE, and have not attempted it again. It's certainly somewhat more challenging than the Original Basic workout.I'm a Tae-Bo enthusiast, so I like almost everything Billy Blanks puts out. I also work out using Walk Away The Pounds 1, 2 and 3 mile DVD set to vary my workouts on a day-to-day basis.At any rate, Tae-Bo Live is a keeper!"
2,"Tae Bo is Excellent, but skip this one","Tae Bo is an excellent way to get fit and Billy Blanks is a master motivator, but skip this one. Billy often times seems like he's making it up as he goes and loses track of his count and excercizes. Moreover, the constant yelling of his assitant with the headset gets very annoying."
3,Too Easy and Too much Advertisment,The major drawback of this DVD is that before the advanced work out there are many advertisments you have to sit through before the video begins. This is extremly annoying and makes me mad everytime I do the workout. I have only done the advanced workout and it is not as intense as his other advanced work outs. One positive thing about it is it has a really good ab workout. I would not have purchased this video if I had tried it first.
5,great!!,"I really like this DVD. It's really nice to have the four different versions all on one. The advanced segment Kicks My Butt, I love it!!!"
5,"A fresh, well-presented combination of depth and practicality","This is a very well-written book giving a practical, hands-on overview of neural networks (NN's) as applied to pattern recognition. Dr. Looney includes most of the ""modern"" neural networks that perform best on pattern recognition problems (no historical one-celled perceptron overviews here!). I was particularly impressed with the radial basis function network description.This book provides an unusual combination of depth and practicality in easy-to-follow text with plenty of clear diagrams. It isn't an ""intro to neural nets"" book, but then it doesn't claim to be one. If you need to solve a pattern recognition problem, and are beyond the level of ""this is called a cell -- it has inputs and outputs"", then Dr. Looney's book will tell you which NN's would probably work best, here is how they work, and here is some pseudocode for them."
3,"Nice, but could have been better","To have a book of ""round the world trip 1933"" must be great? Well unfortuanetly one gets the feeling this book could have been better. More pictures, as Fulton was a very talented photographer in his days. Some countries are hardly represented: Japan 2 pictures, France 1, Java 1. It wouldn't have hurt to include more photographs, as hardly any text is included. I felt the book is not really giving a deep insight in his travels / experiences he had in the 1930's."
1,Mediocre performance destroyed by neo-modernist staging!,"UGH! Another terrible purchase. WHY oh WHY do these modern staging fanatics get their way with period operas? Just as Boris Godunov was ruined by grotesque modern costumes and staging, Berlioz' ""La Damnation de Faust"" is virtually unrecognizable due to hideous staging and costumes from a mental institution.When will the producers of DVD's learn this sort of trash has no appeal for many classical music / opera lovers?The storyline of this opera in particular is almost impossible to follow due to the wretched distractions in bizarre stage design, costumes, and stage direction. Without the sound one would never guess what was going on.Speaking of the sound, I find the performance itself quite lacking. It's dull at best and in competition with the horrible images on screen the music loses the battle.BOYCOTT ALL SUCH MODERN STAGE PRODUCTIONS OF OPERA!"
1,Botched Berlioz,"The German orchestra play this rhythmically vibrant, linear, melodically sprung score as if it was Beethoven or Brahms. It plods, four square, without the fire and thrust of Berlioz' most transcendent score. (Yes, arguable I know.) Avoid this performance; the visuals add nothing, but the good news is neither do they detract from a yawning orchestral ""missing of the point"" and almost total failure to communicate the unique Berlioz profundity and panache. If I seem overly harsh, it is only because I wanted to embrace it so enthusiastically. Stick to the Colin Davis Phillips CD recording. Even the Kent Nagano is well done for the most part, although his singers are inferior to Davis's."
3,travel charger,Works but not what it said it was.Doesn't have folding blades and not the same as picture.
1,other people must be reviewing something else,We bought this product strictly on the advice of the Amazon reviews. Big Big mistake. There is absolutely no learning potential in this toy. It's flimsy and will cause your child pain if they try to use it to stand up.(which is the thing's purpose). The keyboard sounds absolutely terrible and there's no words to the songs! My 12 month old looked at it for about 3 minutes and then started playing with her other toys. There's nothing positive to say about this toy. Other than the cheap price that is. It's like they always say buy cheap buy twice. DO NOT BUY! Spend the extra ten bucks and buy something from a trusted manufacturer like Leapfrog or Vtech. Fisher Price toys are also useless. I'm thinking all of the positive reviews of this product are written by Chicco. Amazon should be looking into it.
2,Not great at all!,"We bought this table as a downstairs activity center - we have the leapfrog table upstairs and our baby always loved it. First, this table is completely unsteady. Our daughter has flipped it over on multiple occasions. As far as activities - she grows bored of if quickly in comparison to the leapfrog table. It isn't nearly as exciting. The construction is also shoddy - even as it stands on a rug it is still wobbly. There is no central bar to secure the two legs - would not recommend and will likely be replacing!"
3,For a younger child,"I bought this for a 16 month old and she seems to be a bit to old for it. I see her playing with it every once in awhile but not much. For the price I think I could have bought her something she would have enjoyed more. It also came with only a few blocks, not enought to build anything with. And you cant buy them any where to fit. All In all I would not tell a friend to buy this toy."
3,ok,Buy this for my son's christmas it quite what i was expecting to me it just plays a lot of crap sorry i did not buy him something v tech instead
4,"Fun toy, but the piano keyboard not so great","It's a fun toy. My 9 mth old loves it. However, the piano keyboard doesn't let you play music on it like you would on a real piano. You press one key once, and an entire song will be played. But my 9 mth old likes it and would spend a whole 15 mins on it (it's considered a long time for him). So it's not bad."
5,Music and Play Table,"She was so exicted playing with this toy. She laughed and screamed as the music played with the lights. She is 8.5 months old and standing up to play with it. She did tip it over but it was not a big deal.We have not flipped over the table to play with the blocks yet, but can't waitWorth the money!"
4,Music N' Play Table,"I think this toy is very educational but at the same time kept my brother very entertained instead of bothering me all of the time. It is a 2 in 1 toy because it has blocks and it has all of the other stuff. When i was 7 I used to love legos but my mom would vacuum them up since I wouldnt pick them up so I decided if I got bigger blocks then that would help. This is a great way to keep your son, daughter, brther or sister entertained and then your parents wwont wvacuum up all the blocks.Thanx a bunchMissy ( Marissa)"
2,Not for a baby pulling up to stand,"My 9 month old is pulling himself up to stand, and while he is very interested in playing with this toy, it VERY EASILY tips over when he tries to stand up. I've had to remove the legs to make this safe for baby to play with. This is OK I guess, but part of my initial interest was in having a toy that would be safe for him to stand and play with. That said, he really likes all the bug sound effects and this is helpful in developing his fine motor skills."
4,Good quality and good price!,Good quality and good price!Thank you very much and will buy again for gift to my friend!Thank you again!
3,Flimsy when child leans on it. Too low when sitting,I purchased this before my daughter started standing well. When sitting it was soooo low she could not reach anything. Once standing her weight would knock it down. Yes it's very educational and entertaining but how can she utilize it if she can't stand or sit. Then when she was able to stand/ taking steps. It was too low. She was bending over to use it which is not good posture.
4,"Decent Toy, Maybe over priced!","My son loves to play with it though he loves a similar toy that is half the price even more. I am glad I got it though. The top easily come apart from the base, and the blocks don't stick well to the base when you use the flip side"
5,Fun and Versatile,"My son loves this toy. The piano on ours detaches and that makes it even more versatile, since he's not standing yet and can play with it on is tummy. The piano has a bunch of different songs and play modes. This is one of our favorite toys:-)"
5,Perfect for my 8 month old,"They call it a 2 in 1 toy, but I'd call it a 4 in 1 toy. We bought this for our 6 month old. At first we would remove the top and let her play with it on the floor. She mostly would bang on the piano and LOVED it! We couldn't pull her away from it! As she has grown she's now able to pull herself up to play with it on the stand. We've never had a problem with it tipping over or being unsteady. I know that as she grows more and gets a little older, she'll start to enjoy the building block side of the toy. Right now she just likes to pull the blocks out of the storage area. That's the other thing, it has has a storage area for the blocks when the piano side of the toy is being used. It's really the prefect toy for this age group!"
3,ok,"i think for the price its really good ,i know my test level boosted allot helped in strength but no real real gains , for a test booster ill buy it againcant beat the price"
4,A nice little covers record,"I remember the first time I heard this record. I was in my friends car and he put this CD in and Goldfinger's thundering fast punk cover of The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"" came blasting on the stereo. I almost nearly had a heartattack laughing and listened in horror as I heard a great song be in, my first impression, butchered. I wanted to scream when he told me they covered ""The Kids Are Alright"" but then he let me borrow this album and after several listens, you start to like the covers and you kinda gotta admire Goldfinger in a weird sort of way for covering songs outside of their genre. All and all, this is just a fun covers record. I would not run out to buy this album but get a burned copy from a friend or find a cheap used copy."
2,A bomb for goldfinger =/,"There are only 2 decent songs on this CD. Goldfinger has made my favorite CD, ""Open Your Eyes"", so I bought this and it definitely wasn't at the same level as Open Your Eyes. If you buy one of their CD's, don't get this one."
4,works decent,"installed this a few months ago, great ot have on the highway or long rides. its kind of bulky and rubs against the thumb. installation was a little tricky due to the poorly written instructions, but it is not that hard to figure out."
5,Throttle lock,"This is well worth the money I spent. 26 bucks and no shipping fee. The picture on the back of the package is less than desireable but with the help of my wife, we were able to decipher the dirrections. All the parts were there and they all got used. Thanks Sound of Rec!!!"
5,Shuttle PC50 300 watt power supply for XPC,"A very tight fit to install ... also required that the Shuttle case be trimmed a bit on the back side to provide clearance for the power plug receptacle. Otherwise, works AOK with no problems. A very needed upgrade."
1,Wrong pin-out for SS51G,I have an old Shuttle SS51G with a bad power supply. This product lists that model as compatible but it is not. My motherboard uses a 1X4 plug and the power supply has a 2X2 connector. Check your connectors against the picture provided before you order.
1,The worst mistake ever,"I have never had a problem purchasing products from amazon.com. But this time i had a hudge problem. I have purchased the power supply for the spesific XPC Shuttle computer. In the description there was listed my PC. I find out what this power supply is not compatible with my PC and had to ship back the product, paying for shiping, and loosing about 50$ in total. Amazon.com Returned 60$ and the part cost me 95$.So be aware of this bull.... Ask expert for the right product. You will save time, nervs and money."
3,Put It to Rest,"Alright it's been awhile so let them all rest....but really folks did not Ireland benefit from the restrictions of the Church being loosened and perhaps the Bishop and Annie (the pawn) were used well on this chess board of politics emeshed in religion. I lean towards givin them a break-- they served Ireland well. The Bishop is doing his work, Annie, foolish in her choices, has paid a dear price. Perhaps you might remember before ever going public, Annie took Peter to Ireland for 6 months just so the Bishop could be given the chance to approach his son which he obviously choose to ignore--- so ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE!!--- So all of you who point the finger soley at one or the other STOP. ATM and that doesn't stand for automated teller machine"
4,a real world story,Annie Murpy had shown in her book how it can happen that a woman fall in love with a bishop and the problems who are caused by this love. Its a real live story with no happy end. The book shows how to people love each other and also fight each other with the same passion. It shows real persons no complete angels or devils but people with their betrails and antruth how it happens every day.
1,Trash,"The book causes you to sympathize with bishop at the end (though I have no respect for religious figures in general). Annie Murphy, a truly professional black mailer, destroys this poor man's world while claiming through out the book that she is the victim. What an abuse of the freedom of expression. Reading the book was a waste of my time and money."
4,64 airline painting schemes of the Boeing 707 up to the 80's,"This full-colour book portrays the markings of the Boeing 707 of well known international carriers as well as lesser known and smaller airlines. A whole page is devoted to each individual airline, with a colour photograph of the painting scheme and descriptive text alongside.Very useful documentation as a reference and for historical study on airline markings."
1,"Should Be Called ""Bluetooth Mystified""","This book has absolutley no practical value. I purchased it in order to answer some very simple questions about the technology, none of which were answered. Instead, the book strays off into a thorough description of WAP and other tangentially related topics.All I want to know is the following: Do current Bluetooth enabled devices use the devices TCP/IP stack, or does Bluetooth depend on some other non-standard protocol? Answers anyone?"
4,table 1.4,"table 1.4 page 23: Performance Characteristics of Bluetooth Productsitem: Range Up to 30 feet(???3 meters???) -> 9,144... meters"
4,A manual for Toyota Landcruiser repair.,"If you want to do-it-yourself repair a Landcruiser you may need a book, and there aren't many choices available. Like any book that covers multiple models, it is nearly impossible in 544 pages to cover everything, and it can get confusing finding the information on any specific item or model. For example, I bought this book to find the location of EGR valve on a 99 L/C but this book didn't help. Good as a reference if you can't find a manual more specific to your year/model."
5,Love this...,"I've been using this dish brush for years and was excited to see it on Amazon. This is the only brush I've used that does not leak and lasts quite a while (typically over a year) before needing to be replaced. The replacement heads are cheap and last a few months- at which point I replace because they are grimy but still work properly. I prefer to purchase this brush over a cheap one that, if I'm lucky, doesn't start to leak until after the first month."
3,Liked it,It looks sturdy and well made. Soap doesn't leak and cleans well. Only negative i can think of is the brush bristles are not strong enough to remove tough grease. You need a scrub to remove those
4,"Rubber cover ripped after 8 months, but OXO replaced it!","I love this brush but the black rubber cover/button ripped and leaked soap after 8 months of moderate use. I emailed up OXO and they replaced it for me after I shipped them the defective unit. (All their customer rep's seem to call themselves 'Martha' for some reason, but I digress).I'm happy with the product over all.On a second note, this brush seems to have problem squirting soap when the soap in the handle runs slow. Add some water if you're too lazy to re-fill in the middle of a wash (like me :) )."
2,Attractive Junk,"I found this item in our trash can the other day and asked my wife why. She said that it had never dispensed soap correctly and that finally the diaphram had just torn and quit working. She also said that the bristles had become stained and even bleach wouldn't clean them. There's a new, cheaper grocery store scrubber beside our sink now."
3,OXO Dish Brush,"Like it, but wish it came with a base like the cheaper model did. Also the dish soap filling hole isn't as friendly as the other one."
3,Weak point is rubber cap,"I've bought 2 of these because they work well for scrubbing most dishes, but both of their rubber caps (where you insert the detergent) developed a crack which leaks soap over everything."
2,Refill & squirt location could hardly be worse...,"Bought this for the same price at a brick & morter store. I was looking forward to using it. But it's clear no one ever tried to use it after designing it.The soap chamber is managed through a rubber stopper (see the black in the middle of the handle,) that isn't held in by anything other than a very low tension rubber stopper. So what happens when you go to use this brush? One of three things:1) You pull open the rubber stopper and the soap comes out all over the place.2) You push the rubber stopper and soap is squirted out when you don't want it to be.3) You hold the brush above the stopper, awkward or you hold the brush below the stopper, awkward.Maybe the palm brush is better laid out.There should be a screw top for the soap chamber and button to squirt the soap out shouldn't be where you're going to hold the handle to wash dishes.Very disappointing."
5,OXO Dish Brush,"I have never been disappointed with an OXO product, and this is no exception. It is easy to fill and to use."
4,Very convenient.,Love the fact that I don't have to pull out the dish soap every time. Great brush and love the ability to replacethe brushes with refills. Haven't had this for very long but so far so good.
1,Not what I wanted,"Too thick to hold comfortablyDoesn't stand up, so you have to lay it on its side or put it in a containerLEAKS after about a yearSoap clogs often"
3,"Good Brush, but stains a little and bristles mat easily","I've been very happy with the cleaning ability of this brush, and the soap dispensing is perfect for regular cleaning. My only problem with it is the bristles don't appear to last very long (I've only had it a month or so and I think it's due for replacement heads) and they do stain from colorful ingredients. The stain goes away eventually but it just makes me a little uneasy when cleaning."
1,I should of listened,"I ignored the negative reviews like I usually do. Don't be fooled by the shininess. THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP!!! Instead of making the handle like a well, it is two halves (poorly) stuck together. I now have to put glue on the bottom to prevent leakage. I shouldn't have to fix something I just bought. You couldn't give me this product for free. Don't ignore the negative reviews like I did."
1,So so design,"I'm not excited about this. Its large enough it does not fit into most glasses. The soap filler sticks up and catches on things, causing it to open and leak soap everywhere. The supposed build in scraper is not really a scraper - its just an edge you can scrape with - its not shaped to be effective as a scraper. I have one of their knife sets and a measuring cup that are excellent products and unfortunately I think this product is poorly designed."
2,"It's ok, kinda disappointing, tho it looks nice.","The soap does leak, and its hard to manage the amount of soap when using this. I found it too big, unwieldy, complicated, so not comfortable to use regularly. Went back too putting a drop of soap on a sponge for quick clean up when there are just a few dishes. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,My worst purchase,"This brush didn't work as intended from the beginning. The button didn't dispense the detergent, the detergent all leaked out of the brush, and after two uses, the stopper/button broke. Wasted money. This is the first time I've rated anything, and the first purchase from Amazon that I regretted."
3,Liked the plastic version better,"After using the original all-plastic OXO day in and day out for over 5 years, the tab that keeps the brush head in place finally gave out. It owed us nothing! :) When ordering I decided to upgrade to the stainless steel version of the brush, thinking it would be a more substantial version of the original. Not so...The soap is difficult to dispense in this version. In the old one, all I had to do was pump the dispenser button once or twice and I had a perfect amount of soap for washing one item. With this one, I have to push the button several times, and bang the brush on the pot/dish/whatever to get the soap flowing. Kind of a pain. The steel surface looks great, but is slippery and hard to hold onto when your hands are wet.All in all, I'd say stick with the original version. Works better, overall."
4,"Steel is cosmetic, not structural","I bought this to replace the similar but non-Steel Oxo Squirting Dish Brush. Both have replaceable heads, but the head receptacle on the non-Steel one that I had cracked, so I figured I'd try to the Steel one as a replacement. Unfortunately, the head receptacle on this is PLASTIC like the other one, not Steel as would be implied by the name.I'm still happy with the purchase; it just wasn't quite as I was hoping. I hope that this one lasts longer than the last one."
3,"Only lasted 7 months, disappointing","While it was intact, it was fine. I don't have a dishwasher, so this was the go-to tool for scrubbing dishes. The plastic that held the head chipped off chunk by chunk until it was rendered useless. Not sure I want to keep spending my money on Oxo scrub brushes, as they haven't lasted longer than 8 months. Gets expensive!"
2,Only works when chamber is full,"I really wanted to love this brush, but the reality is that it doesn't consistently work. When the soap chamber is full, it easily dispenses. When it is less than 3/4, the air in the chamber prevent the soap from dispensing. My palm brush worked better.Great look, but you'll go through a lot of soap."
5,Good PA Speaker,I use this for a PA speaker on my jeep. The speaker is loud and was really easy to hook up. I sprayed it with some flat black spray paint to make it less noticeable underneath my vehicle.
5,Horn Speaker,This product works perfectly for the intended purpose. It's inexpensive and stands up in the rain. Would definitely purchase again.
4,"Good simple gospel music, horrible cd release.","I prefer this record to The Troublemaker. They are both filled with great gospel songs. This record is much more intimate instead of a sounding like a jam session. So I'd give the music 4 stars.As a CD reissue, I give this 0 stars. It's really pitiful. This CD is a reissue of the Family Bible LP from 1980. They changed the order which I don't mind, but they dropped ""An Evening Prayer"" which is unfortunate. They changed the cover from a charming studio photo of Bobby and Willie to a New England postcard. They spent no time remastering the sound. I transferred my vinyl and I did a better job that the record label, and they had theoretically had access to the masters."
2,"So-so book, resources offered","This book is not that good. The instructions are sometimes lacking... Nor is it a ""very good"" reference book to keep on hand. And decidely it is NOT for the anyone more than a raw beginner - the projects are mostly ""simplistic,"" although they are supposed to be for all levels of beaders.I was especially upset that the author lists an entire page of beading resources for those NOT living in the USA - those in the USA get a total of 3 (mediocre at best) resources!Why bother to do even that? Keep your precious book and resources out of the USA - plainly the author wants the good-old USA $$, and that's it!!"
2,Better ones out there,I bought 3 of these to give as gifts and one for myself. I was not impressed with all of the water pistol like pressing I had to do throughout the cleaning. Too much work to get varying amounts of steam. Once in a while I got some good blasts but really had to work for it. Try another brand.
4,Good product,"The reviewer below should note that the burst of steam comes only after you pump the trigger a few times to get enough water into the device. The instructions don't make this clear and I almost returned mine before I figured it out.Once I did, I was very pleased with the steamer. It's powerful enough for most household uses and the attachments add to its versatility."
1,"Disappointed, Returned","Although my expectations weren't high, I still ended up being completely disappointed. It is definitely NOT powerful as advertised. I followed the simple instructions closely but there was no ""burst"" of steam what-so-ever, only a trickle of hot water. I bought it to help keep my baseboards clean but it can't even handle that. Maybe it is defective, maybe not - through my experience, I returned it and I don't recommend it."
1,Not Pleased,"I purchased this and after pressing the trigger for about 45 minutes, it still did not emit any steam. I am not pleased at all with this item and would not reccomend this item."
4,murder on a horses trail,it was a very well written and interesting book-the only problem I had with it was it was a little repetitive in places.I would highly recommend it
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this toaster because I like the retro style. After 3 months, the light went off, after 1 year, the on-off knob stopped working - it stays on (will not shut off - I now have to unplug the toaster after each use. However, It does toast and cook evenly. But it is not worth the $... that I paid for it. This is my second and last DeLonghi (the first one, the door will not close properly 5 months after I bought it."
2,died in 2 years,"After about two years (of course after the warranty was up), this toaster oven died suddenly. For an expensive toaster oven, I expected more than two years of use. I called the customer service center and they were rude and unhelpful, not allowing me to speak to a supervisor, and although I had registered the item and she had all me information in front of her which I had not given her), she lied and stated she did not have the information. This is when she stated that I could not speak to a supervisor. I am very disappointed with this company, their product and the ""service""."
1,Not my old Delonghi Toaster Oven,"Bought this oven because I had had a similar model for 15 years with only one repair--looked good and worked great! When the first Delonghi died, I immediately wanted to replace it with the same model. Thought the retro styling was an added benefit. What a piece of junk the new one is! It is NOT self-cleaning and the timer dial went out before the warranty and it gets way hotter than the dials say. Sent it to be repaired which happened quickly but the repaired unit still doesn't perform like the older one. After reading the other reviews, I think the overheating is a fire hazard. I am replacing this expensive mistake right away."
2,Doh! Now I know why everything went digital...,"This toaster oven LOOKS cool. Everyone who comes into my kitchen comments on it. And frankly that's why I bought it. I figured all toaster ovens are alike, why not get one that looks different. I'll tell you why. The loud clicking of the analog timer is semi-annoying, but if your toast (or whatever) is ready before the timer runs out, you can't just push a button and turn it off. The timer has to tick through to the end. The timer broke the 3rd week I had the thing (ok I confess, I got impatient and tried to turn the timer off before it was done).This toaster oven serves to remind me that looks aren't everything.However it's a roomy little thing and comfortably fits 4 slices of bread. It has a nice baking tray too.Something splattered on the inside of the glass on the door and I cannot clean it off. I don't bake in it and don't use it much so it's just a few spots but they are buggin me because I can't get them off.What I've learned? Go digital. :)"
1,Juck!,this oven is junk - it will not turn off (a slight fire hazzard).I am just holding on to it waiting for the product recall.
1,don't buy this delonghi retro oven,"This is my second delonghi oven. The first was awful but I wanted to give the company one more chance. Big mistake. At about a year, like some other people who wrote a review, the timer button broke. I had it repaired and now six months after that it just died completely yesterday. What an awful product that this company gets away with selling."
1,the worst appliance I've ever owned!,I have the same problem as the other reviewers - this toaster oven doesn't toast or turn on until you play with the controls for a while - I can't wait to replace this horrible oven! Don't buy it!
2,Bad Design,"I used this oven a lot over the last couple of years. Loved everything about it and was not bothered by the timer issue that other people talk about. Although this size oven is a great alternative to cooking in a conventional oven, the negatives outweigh the benefits. It is not at all easy to clean, holds food stains on the outside & the door glass, and after about a year, the door started to jam (would not close without slamming it). We don't have a repair site nearby, so we just dealt with it. Eventually, the door completely broke and now it is useless. I would not recommend this product."
4,good toaster oven,"I was surprised to read all the negative reviews, especially since so many had to do with the same problems with the dials or power on/off. Mine is a black, convection model--not the Retro model--and it's at least 2 years old now. It works fine. The door sometimes has problems shutting completely, but usually opening and closing it a few times fixes the problem. I've baked cookies, pies, pizzas, muffins, chicken, nachos....everything...in this oven. I use it at least once a day. Usually, I'm using it to make dinner for the kids because they're too impatient to wait for my whole oven to heat up. I'm buying a convection toaster oven as a gift for Christmas this year for my mom. (But I guess I'll definitely stay away from the Retro model!)"
2,Sometimes it works,"Sometimes this toaster oven works -- sometimes it doesn't. Ours decides sometimes to toast both sides of the bread -- other times it's just too lazy to complete the task correctly. I long for the old deLonghi toaster oven I had for more than ten years. I'd like to ""retro"" back to that one -- this one is junk."
2,"Burns toast on ""bake/toast"" setting!","I have had this toaster for three years now, and I haven't had any problems with it functioning, except it ALWAYS burn toast on the ""bake/toast"" setting. In order to toast evenly, it must be on the ""broil"" setting! Not a huge deal, unless the person doing the toasting is unaware of this, as items will consistently burn. I found this out the hard way; the first time I used the toaster my entire apartment was filled with black smoke! Although it's still working after a few years of consistent use, I would recommend not purchasing this item."
1,Item did't worrk,Item did not work and I lost money because I had to ship it back to dealer in order to get refund. It cost me $14.00 which I was not reinbursed.
1,What happened??,"Similar results to other reviewers. We got this toaster about 18 months ago. It started out great and looked perfect with our stainless steel appliances. Toast would come out perfect and the oven did a good job on small tasks (french fries, chicken nuggets, etc).Move forward to today. Yikes. It has fallen off a cliff. Half the time it toasts to perfection, the other half it completely chars the top and under-toasts the bottom. Plus the bottom heating elements have fully warped and now only work half the time which ruins the small oven jobs. I can't wait to replace it with a Krups or a Cuisinart. Delonghi should recall this piece of junk and refund all of us...."
1,Crap!,"I bought that toaster oven on eBay, the look got me! After placing my bid, i made a quick search for consumer reviews and it was a big deception! I prayed for days that it would arrive in perfect condition but unfortunately, the timer is not working well! I can't turn to On/Off knob to the On position. So all i can do with this is make some toasts!The look is truly great but i noticed that it gets really really hot! I'll have to keep my little one away from it!it's not worth buying it!"
2,DeLonghi toaster oven,"A lot of money for something that is already broken, having used it for less than 2 months. No service center in my area and I have to mail it (at my expense) to a service center for repairs."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!! SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE,"I bought this toaster oven based on it's stylish appearance. However, after using it a few times, the dial has broke and the heating element has gone out!After phoning DeLonghi customer support, they informed me that my warranty is VOID because I bought it new from an eBay merchant. They claim that any eBay purchase (new or used) voids your manfacturer's warranty!!They then told me that if I needed service, I would have to ship the unit out of state and pay all costs involved with repairing it!For the premium price I paid for this toaster over, I have received the level of service that one would expect if I had purchased some generic toaster oven 'Made in Taiwan' from K-Mart!DeLonghi does NOT stand behind it's products. What a disappointment!"
1,Dangerous failure mode,"I have had this unit for several years and liked it. However, the timer switch failed, and THE TOASTER TURNED ON BY ITSELF! Apparently the mechanism that stops the timer failed, so now the switch continues past the timer stop to the ""on"" position.VERY dangerous. A better engineering design would have prevented this type of failure from being possible."
2,"""Wrecked 'em?......Hell, almost killed 'em!""","I have had my DeLonghi Retro Toaster Oven for about a year. I was attracted to it's distinctive appearance. I read reviews that warned of knob malfunction, but ignored them. After almost burning my house down a few days ago however, I wish I would have listened. While cleaning the countertop around the thing, I must have bumped the dial. ( A very light touch only.) It turned on, but I did not notice. A while later, I was realxing and watching TV when a horrible noxious-- and rapidly escalating stench enveloped me. I had the habit of storing the little grabbing device for the rack inside the thing. It has a rubber handle. It chars rather thoroughly. There was no actual fire, only dense nauseating fumes. After I aired out my house, I actually tested the dial again, and sure enough it malfunctioned in various ways--including failing to turn off. I would advise against this product, based on the fact that it could possibly kill you."
2,Faulty Timer,"I have had the same problem as Tom just a week ago. Our timer keeps ticking, but won't toast or turn on. In order to toast we have to manually hold the timer all the way on dark. The toaster also keeps ticking and seems like it is a fire hazard unless we unplug it everytime. I took it apart, and found a part number on the timer, and am trying to replace it. We'll see how easy it is. Of course ours broke 13 months after buying it (1 month out of warranty)."
1,Looking for reliability? Look elsewhere.,"We've had our XR640 about 1.5 years. It looks cool, and worked fairly well for a while (bit slow to toast).Recently we noticed the back, bottom heating element begin to curve downward. In fact, it looks like the element has stretched with age and now curves in a gentle S-curve. The front element is bowed up. I was going to try and order the elements and replace them, then the toast dial quit working. I've used $30 B&D; toaster ovens that were better quality. I expected more ..."
3,Quick Calculus,This book came very highly recommended to me by a friend. I purchased the book because I was having a hard time with Calc 2 at UMCP. The book did not cover the more advanced calculus of calc 2. The books last chapter was the first chapter of the class. I think the book would have been good for calc 1 but for me it was not very helpful. I also have had a terrible time with calc 2 after doing well in calc 1 it really depends on where you personally stand in your math classes.
2,Great format marred by terrible formula notation,"This book starts strong with a great concept, but by the time you reach derivative rules (one of the more important chapters), the arcane notation used really gets in the way of understanding the lessons."
4,quick shipping,Quick shipping & it was the exact book we needed for my son's class. Couldn't find it anywhere else!
5,It is amazing!,"I am not a big fan of country or rock-a-billy, but I saw Suzy Elkins with The Drapes at their reunion, and it was fantastic!I simply adore this CD, I listen to it all of the time. You should at least try it out!"
3,Bang That head.,"This is really just Thrash metal with black metal vocals,dont get me wrong It does rock and its great to bang your head to,but after a few listens it has no real lasting affect."
5,Loved This Book,"When I saw this book, it was the cover that caught my attention. I was in the band and a lot of my life had a musical theme. I didn't read the notes about the book, I just decided to get it. I read it that night until I couldn't keep my eyes open and finished it the next day. I decided that I wanted to have a copy of this book and ordered it at a local bookstore. I re-read it when it arrived a few weeks later.It is truly a great book and I'm sure my sister will enjoy reading it, too."
4,"Very good stories. Well categorized, and a great preface","I'm a big fan of Horror anthologies, and this is one of the best I've ever read. From the terrific introduction by the editor, to the last page, it was very satisfying. The stories range in intensity from the sheer grit of ""Bad Guy Hats"" to the quirky ""Bob the Dinosaur Goes to Disneyland."" There is something in here for everyone. Everybody gets a chance to be scared by something in here; all bases get covered. If you like horror anthologies, this is a must-read."
1,Amazing Earth,"My husband and I bought this DVD in hopes of learning and seeing more detailed information on earthquakes, volcanos etc. Instead, we were VERY disappointed in this DVD.It turned into a propaganda film to promote evolution. If we had wanted to purchase a DVD on evolution, then we would have. But we did not.It also showed very little interesting footage. There were a few volcano before and after shots, which were good, but otherwise, I got tired of watching hot lava and aged rocks over and over again.There were also several scientists reporting their theories, but none presented any real conclusive evidence to back up their findings, besides the carbon dating of rocks.In the end, my husband (who is more logical than my self and did not want to waste the money we spent on the video) suggested we resell it to some other unsuspecting person, I personally would rather have just tossed it or burned it."
3,Mostly a picture book,"I have to admit, I don't use mudras much, but I am intrigued by the idea. This book presents MANY different mudras and has great illustrations to go with them. Very easy to follow. I would have liked more explaination on how and why they work."
5,love it,"I love this book, doing the mudra on a regular basis has helped me in so many ways. I think every one should have this book. There is a mudra for just about everything. The change and healing starts from with in."
2,Disappointed,This book is glamourized and lacking important information to back up mudra practice. I sent it back.
1,Chicano Colloquialisms are Non-Existent in this Book.,"I had a California literature class with many Chicano colloquialisms, maybe even regional Californian?? So, not one, I mean, not one of the bunch of words I looked up for translations were in this book. Of course, I've been told that you have to distinguish between Mexican and Spanish dictionary reference books, after the fact. So I'm suggesting this consideration to you before you make the wrong purchase."
1,Does anyone think this is funny?,"I bought this book as a gag Christmas gift for an avid golfer. I had to bring it back. The jokes are terrible. The writer is a complete hack.I could go into detail, but why? Here's just one example. Open to page 1 and you'll notice that the people in jokes have names like Mogridge, Balaban, Grimsby, Myers, and Monroe. Does anyone think this is funny?The book is a waste of money unless you get it for free, in which case it would make for good kindling."
4,Compact & Dishwasher Safe.,"This is a very well designed spork. The spoon side has the deepest bowl of all readily available sporks both compact (Moscardino, Bambu) and regular (Light My Fire). The deep spoon makes it easier to scoop soups and sauces, while the tines of the fork side are long enough to work as well as any regular fork. Unlike most other sporks, this one being stainless steel, has a good weight to it and is dishwasher safe.Perfect for frequent travelers and for everyday use. Highly recommended."
2,Creation-Complete ballet is not a ballet,"This release by Art Haus Musik is not a ballet, but a concert preformance. Haydn wrote this as an oratorio, Sometimes such a work is reworked as something else. But this DVD is a concert preformance. See ""Sound&Video""Magazine October 2000 for a review."
1,Bad Description,Unit Weight: 0.2 oz.Size (in inches): 2.25 x 5.25 x 0.75This battery seriously weighs 0.2 ounces??And it's 2.25 inches by 5.25 inches? That far bigger than the entire phone!Whoever wrote this description needs to pay attention to the measurements they are asking for.
3,"Good value, not quite as shown","I purchased these to make some bookmarks as gifts. The product itself seems well made. However, when the package arrived, it did not come in a retail package like the picture shown above. Instead, I received an unmarked box with no instructions and no design templates, just 100 blank bookmark pouches and 2 laminating guides (presumably you insert the bookmark into a guide before inserting it into the laminator, but again, no instructions were included). If you have any experience doing laminating, then this is no problem, but the lack of instructions and templates may be a little uncomfortable for beginners."
5,Learn to fly and sail an airplane,"Yes it's a great intro to float flying prior to getting your seaplane rating. It's also great for a quick reference during your recurrent training and all of your float flying years.You'll see how to take off, land, and ""tie-down"" your boat,er..., your plane in various conditions (winds, waves, other obstacles including your own limitations).Fits perfect in your airplane's document pockets or your flight brief."
3,Works as advertised,"This product performs as specified. It feels sturdy and spray patterns are fully functional. Word of caution, this requires significant grip strength to use for extended periods of time. It does have the trigger lock, which helps with that issue, but if you want to adjust the flow rate, it makes it tough. My kids do not have the strength to operate it."
5,Love my dog,"My 14 year old Aussie has arthitis in both hips and this product keeps her moving. It is going to be a sad day when she is gone , so I appreciate anything that keeps her pain free until that sad day."
3,Great but I pass. I want season sets Sony.,"I don't like 'best of' DVDs because they never include all the best episodes and even if an episode is only average it should still be on DVD.I only want the first 2 seasons of the Real Ghostbusters(RG) on DVD. During the first 2 the show had great plots, funny and witty dialogue, and great chemistry between the characters. Everything worked. Then the show really did a 180 quality wise after season 2. The show lost Lorenzo Music (Venkman) and Arsenio Hall (Winston). Also the plots and dialogue were not up to the standards of the first 2 seasons. Last but certainly not least Slimer became the star of the show.In short after season 2 the RG became just the average Saturday morning kiddie cartoon show. In fact Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon was actually much better than this show after season 2. That's how far this show slipped.Anyway Sony, release season sets 1 and 2 and I'm there. Until then I'll pass."
4,"Okay, now we want the boxed sets","I hope that Sony decides on doing boxed sets with The Real Ghostbusters. I also hope that they take the time to clean up the video because as it is, it looks almost like old VHS tapes. Other cartoon's from the 80's (some that were much inferior to RGB in both quality and popularity) have had very decent DVD releases.While the shows on this DVD are all pretty good (specially Night Game and Lost and Foundry), there are many more, great episodes that must be put on DVD."
2,Heads Up Ghostbusters Fans,"There is a complete series box set that even has the original pilot episode and the entire slimer and the real ghostbusters series in it. Time life got a hold of it, it's about 140.00 to 150.00 dollars but it's got a metal case for all four disks of each season, concept art drawn in each case and a collectible firehouse shell for storing each of the box sets in. Go to [...] and do a search for The Real Ghostbusters, you should be able to find the box set. This DVD on the other hand, has one of the best episodes and I think one or two of the real flop episodes on it, I wouldn't suggest it, it really isn't worth it compared to the other 2 dvds that were released around the same time."
4,Ghostbuster cartoons,"I love these dvd's! brings me back to when i was a kid watching the real ghostbusters. The dvd only has 4 episodes which was a draw back, i don't really think they added the best episodes on any of these dvd's, but it's the original cartoon in dvd form, so it's all good!"
1,very bad movie,no link`s btween the tital of movie and the movie ....very very bad ????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Highly recommended,"I am so impressed with the results of this product, It's now my nightly ritual before bed. Will be looking into more of Trevor H Scott self Hypnosis CDs."
2,Dublicate,"If you buy this CD do not buy the ""Motivation to Move"" CD because both CDS are repeats with same words and etc. I tried to call the phone number printed on the CDS to voice my concerns but the number is not a working number. BEWARE!"
3,I am VERY pleased with this system!,"I purchased this stereo because I wanted a small stereo that had great sound. I had read other reviews and decided to puchase this stereo/CD player and I am very glad I did! The sound is the best of all other stereos I have had in the past! What is really funny is I had to leave town last minute and my housesitter was blown away with the sound quality! She said she saw this small stereo and was blown away by the quality after she inserted a CD! She wanted to know right away where she could get one too! The only negative I have is the awkwardness in putting the CD into the player. You have to push the CD until it clicks in without pushing the unit itself(when it is not wall mounted), but the sound quality makes up this little inconvenience!!"
4,"Nice, but not really ""wall mountable""","Although no photo appears on the Amazon site, the TEAC MC-DX20B is described as ""wall mountable."" However, the larger, bulky subwoofer cannot be hung on the wall easily and would look goofy on a table top. And of course, the subwoofer really needs to be located near the speakers for the optimum sound - the instruction book even states that it needs to be positioned nearby.I rated it four stars, however, because I would say that with respect to what is important in a stereo - the sound - it is definitely a winner. Unfortunately, I'll be returning mine for a more petite model that will fit my needs better."
4,Surprisingly Nice System,"First of all I want to say that I love Amazon and how efficient and timely they are. The Teac system is very sleek and compact and sounds great! I bought this for my partner who wanted a single disc system, so she is loving it. I would personally prefer a system with multi-disc capacity. The remote is surprisingly heavy; not a bad thing. There seems to be some difficulty in consistent response to the power on/off function from the remote. All in all this system well exceeds any expectation I would have had for so inexpensive a product."
4,Wide-Ranging Collection of Songs,"This book has over 100 songs - a great deal for the price. It has many well-known songs, but perhaps even more less well-known songs which makes it a wonderful collection - you are less likely to have duplicates from other ""collection"" books. At the beginning of each song is a brief history of that song - a nice feature. Overall, I'm glad I added this book to my music library."
4,The French did Baroque too.,"Okay, so you've heard the Masterpiece Theater intro. They only play the Rondeau. Mouret wrote more and no one plays it, but it is lovely. Delalande's music makes you think you are being rowed along the canals of Versailles.Enjoyable at a reasonable price."
4,Mouret's Suite of Symphonies No.1: The Complete Work,"This is the only COMPLETE recording of the suite no. 1 that I could find - which is not to say that there are no others. I believe there is a pricier boxed set of Maurice Andre that contains the same recording. Although a DDD recording, this is not audiophile quality. Vivaldi's RV 534 struck me in particular as lacking in dynamic range. But with Maurice Andre, Mouret's complete suite No. 1 and a great price, it's hard to go wrong."
3,I wanted to try the Aquafresh Sensitive Toothpaste ...,"I wanted to try the Aquafresh Sensitive Toothpaste because I have sensitive teeth and I dislike most of the other """"sensitive"""" toothpaste products on the market. Unfortunately, I didn't find this product to be much different than other products that I've tried. The freshness was okay, but not as good as with some of the non-sensitive products out there."
3,I liked the toothpaste because it made my ...,"I liked the toothpaste because it made my teeth less sensitive to hot or cold. It also helped with tartar. I'd like to see it with a stronger mint taste, though. It doesn't bubble up as much as regular toothpaste does."
3,I thought that this toothpaste had a very ...,"I thought that this toothpaste had a very nice taste, but I found a couple of problems with it that would cause me not to use it again. First of all, it didn't leave my teeth feeling as clean as when I brush with my regular toothpaste. Secondly, it has a warning on the package that says you shouldn't use it for more than 10 days at a time. When I purchase toothpaste, it's for use until it is gone, not for periodic use only. Maybe this product would be good for someone who has just had dental work done and needs it only for a very short time."
4,I'm recommending this product to all of us ...,"I'm recommending this product to all of us that, for one reason or another, have sensitive teeth. The taste was pleasant. I brushed my teeth without the pain that I've experienced with other products. It greatly helped in keeping me on my oral regimen."
3,Not Bona Fide,"The reviewer who said ""Too Much Sax"" got it right - the others have missed the mark.Any resemblance to the previous excellent CD ""Royal Function"" is purely coincidental - the group seems to have changed its core approach - they have traded in their million $ piano and keyboard sound for a cheapskate shrill saxophone sound. why they chose to do this - the only explanation that I can suggest - is they sold out to ""commercialism"".This CD does not come close to their outstanding ""Royal Function"" CD. If they could ""revert"" back to their lush, gorgeous, piano sound - they could do wonders.Overall, a very disappointed fan. Hope they can put their ""Bona Fide Horns"" on the back-bench and put their superstar piano/xylophone/keyboards front and center where they belong."
4,something to think about,"I am planning a root cellar, and this book was a big assist. I am a little farther south, and so it had a lot of information that is less applicable to me. Valuable for the northern half of the U.S."
3,Good for One Specific Design,"This pamphlet contains fairly detailed instructions on how to build a 12'x8' root cellar on a flat piece of ground (dig 4 feet down, stack the cinder block walls, put on a wooden roof, and heap the excavated soil over and around it. It contains no information for modifying or enlarging the design, how to use the cellar, or anything else. Still, it's reasonably priced, so I was satisfied with the limited info."
4,Root Cellar,"Short, sweet, and to the point. Even I could follow the directions, and I'm not a building contractor. Bought it with ""Root Cellaring, Natural Cold Storage of Fruits & Vegtables, by Mike and Nancy Bubel"", and between the two, have a pretty comprehensive idea of what to do, and how to do it."
2,Not Practical,"Certainly informative and thorough, however I question the practicality of their plan for the type of person (me), who would actually build something like this. This is a plan for the Rolls Royce of Root Cellars"
4,Great!!!,"This is a great book for people, like me, who have some experience with tools but aren't super-skilled. The author also encourages DIY folks to modify his plan, improvise, and use what supplies you have on hand. Thanks!"
4,Good but not big enough,"I realized when I purchased this book it must be small. That is the only sad part of this book. I loved the hows, just wished there were more variation to building various types of root cellars. It gives a very detailed version of a block wall underground cellar. I would like other ideas."
4,how to build a root cellar,"was quite informative for me,as i was looking for info on building a root cellar. was hoping it would have a few more ""styles"" or ""designs"".but,as a ""basics of.."" kind of thing it was great.i'm hoping the authors will do a new version that wil add more designs.i'm glad that they did this book."
3,Build Your Own underground Root Cellar,Build Your Own underground Root Cellar is a pamplet and not a book It failed the info vs cost ratio.
4,The old ways are Sometimes the best,Good book will come in handy if the power grid goes down. People could use this book to keep food and stave off starvation if they have the space as i do to build a root cellar.
1,farm,information in side should have been sent for free with two other storey book purchases would not reccomend this to others
4,"Overall, a great book!","This book was informative and an easy read. As a lesbian parent of a small child,I was really looking for a book on lesbian parenting. This book includes a great deal about becoming a parent so I would recommend this book to gay or lesbian folks who are thinking about becoming parents as the chapters on adoption, co-parenting, donor insemination, etc. were well written and seemed to cover just about every aspect that goes into the decision to be a parent and how to become one. Even though only 1/2 of the book covered actual parenting and some of it included the authors heartbreaking personal experiences, I found the information to be very helpful to me as a lesbian parent."
4,not easy,"ok, it works fine. The negative is its hard to put the feeder tubing on the outlets. i had to heat the tubing to get them on, even so it was hard."
4,"So far, so good.","I have owned this retro convection oven for 3 weeks now and have no complaints. Today I used the convection feature for the first time - and wow! My filo tarts were done in half the time, crisp on the outside, just perfect. I may retire my microwave. The toaster aspect works well, though you can't turn off the timer once you begin toasting - but that's no big deal, I figured out what setting I like right away. I admit, I was seduced by this oven's retro style, and am pleased that it works as good as it looks."
4,Delonghi AR690 Retro Convextion Oven,"If you had a 1/2 rating I would give this product a 4 1/2. The only flaw it seems to have is in toasting, it drys out the bread rather than actually toasting and turning toasted color.Other than that I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,Am I the Only One???,"I have so many problems with trying to just TOAST in this thing! I love the design of it, but I have tried every setting, every placement of the toast, etc. but it BURNS every time, or, better yet, putting it on the lighter setting, does nothing. Wheat fields are crying at the waste of bread that has gone throught this machine. It really is like a ""dumb blonde"" joke, it should just sit there and look pretty. Ugh!"
4,Orion's Beethoven - 'Superangel' (Universal),"Originally released in 1973, this was the Argentina progressive / psych / symphonic trio's first of two lp's. I was a bit taken with how much I wound up liking this CD reissue. Tunes that I thought showed just what these guys are all about are the well-played title track ""Superangel"", ""Retrato De Alguien"" (with it's Hendrix-like guitar) and the awesome thirteen-minute ""Hijo del Relampago"". Line-up: Roman Bar - bass & vocals, Adrian Bar - guitar and Jose Luis Gonzalez - drums. Might appeal to fans of Emerson Lake & Palmer, early Bad Company or possibly even the first couple of Zeppelin albums."
5,very fun,"as all the lower star ratings say.. it takes a good 30-40 to learn if you have never played. its like a modern day risk, but i get bored with risk so this is way better. u can constantly be interactive even when its not your turn. i would reccomend figuring it out before you play with new players. i will admit the game gets better as everyone has played once or twice. i loved this game, was a great christmas game to bring out when things were getting slow. the expantion pack changes a few game rules so be aware of that. over all A+ game."
5,My dreams came true,"Since somebody told me about this game, I always wanted,but was a little expensive, and when I found this bundle, I bought it immediatly. It's the best gift, great game, I'm sleepless just for playing. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Great Game!,This game is one of the best I have played. Great for older kids and adults as well. After several of our friends played it with us they bought it right away. Amazon has the best price for it as well with free shipping!
1,Too Complicated,"This is a very complicated game even for a very bright 11 year old, and much too much for me at 74, even with a Doctorate in eduction."
4,Great Game,Settlers of Catan is a great alternative to the normal board game choices of Monopoly and other overly simplistic possibilities. I enjoy the game play but felt that the quality of the board could be improved. I was playing in an extremely humid environment and the hexagons immediately warped making it difficult to fit the board together in an organized fashion. Other than that I have no gripes.The expansion pack is good for larger groups but I wouldn't suggest moving on to games of those size until most of the players have a solid grasp of the original 3-4 person game.
5,good game!,"Have enjoyed playing this game with the family - glad I bought it! Challenging, but not overly so. Basic game rules are well-explained. We especially like the ""almanac"" of game terms."
5,Fun Game,Gave this package to our daughter and son-n-law. Pulled it out the other night and played for the first time. We had a ball. Thinking we might need to add a couple of the add ons.
5,FUN board game for a wide age range! We're HOOKED!,"Friends of ours invited us over for game night to play Settlers of Catan (we had never heard of it before) - and now we are HOOKED! It's fun, fast-paced and includes a good mix of luck and strategy. Can be played by older kids as well as adults. The best part? The rules are SIMPLE! Just a few short pages and your ready to begin play. Great game. Great concept. I'm just bummed I didn't learn about this game earlier in life!"
5,Great way to 'waste' many hours,"Had never played this game until my friends got me hooked on it recently. Even though I received it as a gift, I did the ordering myself so I know that it is shipped in a timely manner. This game will be slightly confusing at first as you get to learn the finer points of it, but once learned it will be a blast. My friends and I play this game a couple times a month and it still plays out different each time. The point of this game is to collect materials (such as ore, brick, wood, etc.) in order to construct roads, towns, and cities. Each is worth a point total and the first player to reach a certain amount of points wins.This game often lasts around an hour although this can be lengthened by the numerous add-ons/expansion packs available. This game is very fun and one that I would recommend to anyone. Great way to spend an evening."
5,"Extremely fun game, and definitely not just for kids!","I've been playing this game with friends about 6 years now, and we love it. You definitely want the expansion set so you can play with more than 4. And don't let your kids have all the fun. I'm single, and my friends and I love playing Catan on a rainy day or cold night. If you like Risk, you'll enjoy Catan. If you don't like Risk, you'll enjoy Catan. Just play it!"
4,Hours of competitive pleasure await you,"We played this game at a friend's and had to buy it for ourselves. My pre-teens saved their own money to buy the bundle (a huge feat for them--that's how much they loved it). They wanted to be sure more than just 4 people could play at a time. (You need the expansion pack for that.) This game teaches all kinds of reasoning and logic skills, bargaining, stock-piling, thrifty spending. It's fantastic. Our only complaint is that we can't get it to lie quite flat on the table with the expansion pieces in place. It's fine if we just play the smaller version. The ability to rearrange the board every time you play gives endless combinations to challenge you. Have a great time. Note from the kids: DON'T invite 10 and under kids to play unless they partner with an adult. It's too long and complicated for their mental reasoning level."
4,Catan,"My friends and I sometimes play Catan at school, and everyone always excited and gathers around the table when the guy with the game starts setting it up."
5,"All time, long term favorite family game","My son, myself and close family friends have been playing this game steady every week or two for approx 4 years now. It's always fun, always challenging, always a loud and boisterous time. We usually use the wonderful addon Seafarers of Catan with it. On our own, we've added another die so we roll three each turn. We've added more rules, switched some of the old rules up a bit just for added challenge. And two of my son's friends have created their own versions--one is a zombie version and the other is based on the Native American fight for their land. Catan is amazing. My recommendation for beginners, do the online tutorial first, play basic catan until you 'get it' then expand to the seafarers and you def need both 5-6 player expansion packs."
5,Great Game,"This game is challenging and addictive. Though it does play the best with six people (requires 5-6 player add on). Be sure to check that all pieces came with the game - mine was missing a few pieces, but Mayfair games quickly and effortlessly sent the missing pieces once I notified them."
5,Excellent purchase,We have enjoyed playing this game as a family very much over the holidays. We highly recommend it to others.
2,Do not buy the US version of this game!,"I am a Catan player for more than 10 years and I have played with the German and the Dutch versions.The US version is BAD! First of all, the development cards and the resources cards are huge! They are almost the same size with regular playing cards which makes it difficult to control. The other bad thing is, there is no place to hold the cards separated during the game!!! It is crucial! It is very bad! If you are a player, you would know what I am saying! The German and Dutch versions have containers to hold these cards!This version is extremely bad, I am very unsatisfied and I will return it."
5,A wonderful game,The game arrived in excellent condition and we play it all the time. It's absolutely wonderful.
5,It is great!,"This video is the funniest British television show that I have ever seen. Patsy is the cruelist and the funniest person! She is always mean to Saffy, but she can be so hilarious when she speaks about her!Erin of California"
2,I only understand American English.,I know this film was a smash hit with everyone who saw it.I'm sorry but it was a disappointment to me. I almost couldn't understand a word that these British actresses said so ofcourse I could not figure out what it was about.
1,the ultimate idaho,You will be better served to buy a road map. Black and white with lots of facts and figures. Nothing in color other than the cover and no commentary about what a newcomer can look forward to. Don't waste your money.
2,"Mediocre, but an overall poor value","This was my first Brubeck disc. The music, as others have noted, feels undistinguished overall, and though I approached the Chromatic Fantasy Sonata with high expectations, it was disappointing, seeming to wander aimlessly without any sort of unifying idea. The sonata--the disc's major work--lacks any melodic cohesion and only passingly refers to Bach. The pianist plays with a consistently harsh and loud dynamic, and the music itself is less interesting than a jazz improv session. Fans of classical music and Bach in particular (whose own masterful 'Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue' is used as a starting point for Brubeck's sonata) will be highly disappointed by this sub-par disc."
4,Book for Literacy class,"This book is good fo learning about literacy research and strategies in teaching children how to read and write. I bought this for one of my grad school classes and although it is not necessarily an easy read, it is very interesting, considering I am passionate about the subject!"
2,DISGUSTING,"My title is a true heart felt reality to this slow series. Since I am not off into politics, I got exactly what I paid for."
2,All the James Carville you never wanted to see and more.,"All this HBO series serves to prove is that, despite its other great series that they also can make large mistakes.This series really makes one wonder how thick the cataracts on Ms.Matilins heart, mind and soul are, as well as the obvious ones on her eyes!"
1,K-STREET?,"I'D NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A CHANCE AND BUY IT-IT TURNED OUT TO BE A WASTE OF MONEY. THIS IS THE WORST ""SHOW"" I'VE EVER NOT WATCHED. GIVE ME A BREAK-PURE GARBAGE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TITLED ""DIRT-STREET"". PEACE..."
1,just not for me,"This show is so boring all it's about is poltics. What was HBO thinking having the one of the oddest shows out, it doesn't play no background music even when it's going off. And all the people do on that show is argue like petie little children, in one episode I found very shocking to hear was from a blond hair woman saying the two oldest sons of Saddam Hussian that died they made their bodies into make up she said it's so (Queer Eye for the Straite Guy) and another episode she call a gay a fag, I didn't know she had that in her. What I found weird was why would actor George Clooney would talk what the show is all about during previews, he has nothing to do with political things. Thank god ""K-Street"" never did get a second season."
1,Deadly dull,"I can't see ever finishing this series. I'm not sure I want to put myself through it. It's totally annoying and rather tortuous to watch. We do need to watch those who make/sway policy but surely there's a less excruciating and easier way. Not meant to be an expose, anyway, or they could have done a better job."
1,Don't throw away your money like I threw these plugs,"I put a set of these in my '95 Camaro. 6 weeks later they are in the garbage and a set of AC plugs are in.Misfire and backfire at speed. I thought it must be wires so a new set of wires I put in. No change, so a coil and ICM. No change. New distributor and no change.Back to basics starting with the plugs. Sure enough the Bosch +4 were the problem, so I can not recommend these since they caused me several hundred dollars in components I did not need. Plus the extra cost of new plugs and waste of money spent on the Bosch.Think twice before buying these."
1,Terrible Fuel Economy,I was getting terrible fuel economy on my Corolla with these Platinum 4 plugs. They cost 6-8 times more than the OEM NGK plugs and for what? 12-15 mpg city+freeway mixed driving for an econobox?I installed OEM NGK plugs and saw to my satisfaction that cheaper OEM plugs brought me better fuel economy 25+ MPG.Always use OEM parts on your cars.Do not be misled by pseudo performance increase claims.Keep your money in your pocket.
2,Only worked for 5 months...,"It only worked for couple of moths and it started giving me problems, my MDX started clinging when starting up, these spark plugs made me change a starter on a car because the car didn't start ones or twise. I also made sure that the battery was good. Just get OEM spark plugs if you don't want any trouble on a long run.P.SOnyl reason I gave it 2 starts is because it increased fuel efficiency just a little bit (and I'm guessing it's because that I had old spark plugs before."
1,"no me llegaron,,",good morning I missed the spark plugs was not what the problem came the spark plugs cables but I would not know if the problem was you or the carrier if the carrier would send me something to confirm that you brought that to my mailbox for my move to Venezuela
3,Mirazyme seems to work OK,"Mirazyme seems to work OK, although for my mountain biking pads, it did not seem to completely remove the odor. I eneded up just washing the pads, and regular detergent did a better job. As far as being unscented, it actually has an odor that I found somewhat unpleasant. Maybe once the treated product has dried, it should be rinsed a few times to get the smell of the Mirazyme out."
5,Great product,"Did a good job with two applications. Normal strength application was not enough to cut the stink in my heavy use backpack with odors accumulated in more than 3 years and 3,000 miles. Removed offensive odors without leaving perfumed scent. Gutsy."
4,The Light of the Soul,"This book is a paraphrasing of the ""Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali,"" as understood by Alice Bailey. The Sutras are the basis of Raja Yoga, which is the Science of the Soul, hence the title, ""The Light of the Soul."" The 51 Sutras are explained in Book I. Book II consists of a description of the steps that lead to Union, i.e., the means of attaining that state which has been traditionally called the ""mystical union"" in Christian faiths. The results of this Union are shared in Book III by explaining another 55 Sutras. The last Book, # IV, is by far the most difficult to understand since it treats of ILLUMINATION, a state unattainable by man. The 4 Books are bound into one: ""The Light of the Soul."""
5,Fantastic!,"Not much to say except ""GREAT"" Very well put together and enjoyable to listen to. This cd is a good choice for someone looking for new stuff. Way to go!"
5,PERFECT FOR SLOW READERS,"When I stick my neck out and try to read a whole book, it better have lots of action to keep me awake and not all those big words that they always put in ""literature"". This book has lots of hot scenes (if you know what I mean) and keeps jumping to different countries so you don't get bored. Plus it's really easy to remember who's who since each character basically just acts one way for the whole book."
4,Deep waters but entertaining,"The Triumph and the Glory is a novel that has been crafted to appeal on more than one level, at least that's how it struck me. I've read it twice and it seemed like a different novel the second time around. Just as good, but in a different way. I understood the characters' motivations differently, gained different insights from the same dialogue, found myself seeing the action unfold from a new perspective, and appreciated for the first time the subdued inner theme shining just beneath the surface of the primary theme."
4,A new Michener,"I was a little intimidated by some of the earlier reviews I've seen here, it is apparent that people who like this book REALLY like it and are very good at expressing themselves. I can't write that well but I can say that The Triumph and the Glory lifted my spirits, restored some of my lost faith in humanity, and made me realize that each of us is only here for a little while, that life is fragile, and that the greatest joy in life is to reach out a hand to someone who needs your help."
4,Eloquent writing,"I've heard a lot about this book and had to find out for myself what all the commotion was about. The Triumph and the Glory is brilliant at times, and very effective at presenting a vivid, realistic account of the war years and the challenges, suffering, and courage required of the men and women who lived through those memorable times. I was very impressed with the ending, it was so unexpected, yet SO RIGHT."
2,"Simple writing, mediocre plot","I can't believe the people raving about this eighth-grade book. makes me wonder if someone's stacking the deck. Wasn't bad, just a Sidney Sheldon style treatment of WW11."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you really want to read some good fiction, look at some of the four- and five-star reviews below."
1,The fiction equivalent of paint-by-numbers,"I had high hopes for this book based on all the detailed superlatives below. It was unbelievable. The writing is at an eighth grade level. The stereotypes and historical mistakes are irritating. By the end, you feel like the book has dragged on longer than the war itself did."
1,Terrible,I thought all the great things everybody said on Amazon meant this was an awesome book. I was so wrong. It has lots of mistakes and the story isn't even very good.
4,Hard to set aside,"Triumph hit nothing but net when it came to depictions of combat, the confrontations in the skies over japan and Germany were done with an expert touch, I almost got airsick. I followed the subplot shifting without any problem, I like books that feature a multi-character story, the Children of the Lion series books by Peter Danielson were done in the same format, and very effectively I thought. Triumph hit the rim a few times on the political sections with the leaders and all, Stalin et al were just sideshows to the real plot so I didn't get much out of those parts. This is a 5 star men's adventure novel but a 3 star mainstream fiction novel, if that makes any sense."
3,OK,"This novel is OK. The book is not Hemingway material. The book is NOT unreadable. The Triumph and the Glory is your basic action novel set in wartime and entertains the reader with the basic dramatic situations that would ensue under such conditions. I guess San Francisco must have dug down pretty deep in his pocket for that four dollars he shelled out for Rustad's book to be claiming in self-righteous frenzy that the publisher and the author and amazon are in league with the Antichrist to bamboozle him out of so much cash. When I'm disappointed in a novel or movie I like to think I'm a little more mature about it than to go around hurling abuse in all directions. This book is very good at times, but suffers from some hasty narrative here and there, and an urgency to move the story along. Three stars. I'd buy it again."
5,FIVE STARS,"Searing irony, heart-pounding battles, betrayal lurking just around the corner, love, unrequited love, killing to keep from being killed, political scheming, surprises, anticipation of bright future, longing for home, brutal villains, final goodbyes. No, I'm not talking about an hour in the life of President Clinton, I'm talking about this riveting novel. Good. Good. Good."
5,SUPER,CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. The story just grabbed me from the start. I loved the faith in humanity that Yuri displayed. Too bad he and Kathe couldn't have found each other. Maybe in the sequel . . . .
1,overblown tripe,"This is possibly the dumbest book I've ever had the displeasure of reading fifty pages of. Just awful, awful stuff. It's WWII by way of ""Hart to Hart"" or ""Dynasty."" What's with these reviewers? Could they use the word ""epic"" any more often? Are they all the same person?"
1,Superficial drivel,"Lindberg is a cardboard character. The scenes are flimsily pasted together, lurching from one WWII newsreel highlight to the next. Everyone talks as if they were trapped in a B-movie. Don't waste your money. Get ""The Winds of War"" or ""The Naked and The Dead"" or ""Catch-22"" or ""One to Count Cadence"" instead."
3,"Buy it, read it, but don't expect much","I'm reading and enjoying Triumph and Glory, but Its not the kind of book I'd keep on my shelf for re-reading. I paid full price for it, but I'd suggest waiting till it is remaindered.Rustad covers the main theaters of the war, and makes several good historical and political points. But, the characters are poorly and thinly drawn. They never really seem to come to life. The plot occaisionally gets up to weak. He gets his historical facts right, and...this might be a painless way of getting some history.But, Rustad also gets his details wrong. He has a Marine recruit going thru boot camp with an M2 carbine. The M2 is a carbine with a full auto switch. Almost certainly a recruit would have been issued an M1 Garand semi-auto rifle, tho he might have used a carbine in combat. A Russian soldier is armed with a Kalishnikov, a weapon not developed until several years after the war.Jerome A. Schroeder"
4,A good war novel,"My first impression of this book was good, it created an urge to read on, so I did. The story is mainly about a pilot, Wilson Lindberg, and his determination to prove his courage, both to himself and his crew. The novel then expands to bring in the rest of a cast of characters including the pilot's younger brother, a Marine, an idealistic war correspondent and his mistress, and a Berlin hausfrau and her Luftwaffe husband, among others, and weaves a number of tales throughout the main plot. It worked well, I thought, there was a good balance between scenes and they served to propel the plot ever faster towards the concluding scenes, which were very moving. The only criticism I have of the book is that it should have focused more on the great drama of the Berlin Airlift, the author should have devoted another chapter or two in the last part of The Triumph and the Glory. This was a good start to the series, I'm looking forward to Winds of Judgement."
2,You don't expect me to believe that!,"This was an entertaining, easy, light read, but the coincidences built into the story line are a bit much to swallow. It's not enough that one character meets Solzhenitsyn in the Gulag, another happens to meet JFK in a bar, a third fights at Iwo Jima and helps raise the flag, and a fourth character happens to be at Churchill's famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech. At the end all of the characters lives become linked. Save this one for the beach!"
4,Good read on a rainy day,"I wouldn't call this a masterpiece like some other reviewers, but still this is an excellent book on WWII. Memorable scenes like the Russian invasion of Berlin and the sadness at the end. Buy it, the hours will pass by quickly."
4,Excellent inside look at WWII,This is a very absorbing look at WWII and it's resulting affects on the lives of a small cast of characters. It will educate the uneducated about this epic period in history and entertain those just in the mood for an exciting love story.
4,Wonderful fiction,"I loved this novel. The style was compelling and the inclusion of real characters effective for introducing even more intrigue and tension into the plot. The relationship between Wilson and Gabrielle was so bittersweet! And the farewell scene with the Russian nurse and young Yuri was great! But some of the reviewers need to get a grip, The Triumph and the Glory isn't Hemingway calibre. But I liked it!"
1,Please don't believe these ballot-stuffing lies!,"This book is a bore - please ignore the false reviews below. It is cliched, hackneyed tripe. It's full of historical inaccuracies and purple prose. It's quite obvious that the author or his publisher is writing false reviews to bolster sales of the book. Please don't be taken like I was."
1,All these 5 star reviews can't be real!,"After reading through reviews for this book that compared it's author to Hemingway, I thought I had found a real winner. Sadly, I was mistaken. It's obvious to me that someone is writing false reviews for this book. No one in their right mind would compare this guy to Danielle Steele, let alone Hemingway. What a disappointment."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK BASED ON ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS. THIS BOOK IS SO DISAPPOINTING. I ALWAYS LIKE TO FINISH A BOOK EVEN IF IT'S TERRIBLE, BUT I THINK I HAVE ALREADY WASTED ENOUGHT TIME ON THIS ONE."
4,Death claims unlikely victims in the crucible of war,"Sudden death lurks in wait everyone in this book. The Soviet boy-soldier Yuri is the most intriguing character in the novel. Motivated by pure and simple love of country to run off and join the Red Army, he finds himself in the brutal slaughter of the Eastern Front, and what makes the book is that his greatest danger is not from the Nazis-- although they nearly get him time after time--but his own side. Framed by a scheming weasel of a political commissar, Yuri gets thrown into a punishment unit as cannon fodder and finds sudden death a constant companion. Rustad chould have developed this part more, and maybe not had Wilson's younger brother in the book at all, he was just sort of a clone of Wilson anyway. The Arlington scenes with Truman and Bradley choked me up, the emotion was intense at that point. I wish the ending would have been different, it was almost too much to bear."
3,Good but lacked depth at times,"The Triumph and the Glory really needed to be seven or eight hundred pages to accomplish the ambitious task of covering what it set out to cover. I loved the scenes but most of them seemed to stop just when they were really grabbing me. It was frustrating, but the next scene was also good, so that was OK but then it too seemed to get cut short in order to move along to the next subplot. Still, the book was VERY interesting and left me satisfied. It hust could have been So much better if the editors hadn't squeezed it into 400 pages."
4,Gripping tale of betrayal and redemption,"The best passages in The Triumph and the Glory were devoted to the Rostovs, Yuri and his father, and their respective fates at the hands of the Soviet Secret Police. The novel of course, spreads its wings far beyond the intrigues of the Eastern Front, the main character, Wilson Lindberg, is a B-17 and later B-29 pilot who faces the ultimate challenge in the skies over Berlin AFTER the war ends. The female characters--Kathe, Katya, Maggie O'Rourke, maintain a powerful presence even when they are far from the action. This is a fine novel, I would encourage anyone with an interest in the fascinating dynamics of human reaction to conflict and threat to read it, you won't be sorry."
5,Magnificent! Just magnificent!,"This book is a reading experience to remember, seldom have I ever been so moved by a novel. The Triumph and the Glory resounds with epic action, glows with the beauty of young love, and aches in soulful moments with bittersweet longing. Wilson, Katya, Sinclair, and Yuri, you will come to know these characters and love them as family. Then there's the ending! When the redemption sought for so long against such impossible odds is bestowed at last upon a flawed, forgotten hero, you will experience emotions seldom drawn from your soul by words on a page. An unforgettable novel!"
4,Just try to put it down . . .,"The Triumph and the Glory will appeal more to Tom Clancy or Stephen Coontz fans than members of Oprah's legions or faithful followers of Anne Rice's vampire books. I happen to have broad tastes in fiction and enjoy all of the above, depending upon my mood. Triumph is a very good war novel, a very good historical fiction novel, and should be judged on it's content, not on whether someone saw a rave review somewhere, bought a copy expecting the moon, sun, stars, and ecstatic happiness forever, and then whines because they didn't see God after all. I enjoyed the book, it was suspenseful, interesting, emotionally satisfying, and graced with a finale that left me thoughtful and reflective. I consider my $4.79 well spent."
3,Good book: but many typos,"This is a really great book, with a great subject matter... My only complaint is that there are a lot of typos in this book.. Many words are misspelled, and accents are used spontaneously."
3,Kindle edition,"Stout's stories are fabulous. The kindle edition, however, is terrible. There is missing punctuation throughout, making the book surprisingly difficult to read. For almost $7, I'd really expect better. Honestly, I'd like my money back."
2,Overlapping Stories,"Some of the stories (or novellas) in this collection are found in some of Stout's other anthologies, making it somewhat frustrating for the aficionado. Susggest skipping this one in favor of ""Trouble in Triplicate,"" which does not reproduce the weakest of the stories here."
2,Not as nice as the prior model,I loved my Sudini shoes from 2 years ago and bought these because I thought they were the same. The heel was not as high and the toe is very sharp. I returned them.
3,Visual evaluation,"After unpacking the unit I was disappointed in that the door does not seal. In addition there is a gap at the right upper corner which would cause heat to escape and force the oven to cycle more frequently to maintain temperature. I purchased this oven for use in my polymer clay business and require a steady temp. I will be returning the item. The cosmetic design is very appealing, but more thought and attention are required in functionality."
5,Much more than a toaster oven!,"We've been using the Delonghi Retro for a few weeks now, and it works great! So far have only used it for cake baking with the air-bake feature, and they come out perfectly! We had another Delonghi toaster oven for maybe 15 years, and it was still working except that it was getting a little rusty looking inside. The new Retro oven is a large unit, which you should be aware of if you have limited counter space. The instructions suggest that you keep a space of about 4 inches between it and other things on your countertop because it does get hot on the outside.I recommend the Delonghi very highly based on long term use of their products. Also, the Italian design is gorgeous."
3,Not for the serious cook,"The interior of this oven is an awkward size. The manufacturer expects one to use the provided lasagna and broiler pans. Few of my pans fit. A standard sheet cake pan is accomodated in the side slots but a regular quarter sheet cookie tin is .5 inches too wide; a special rimless cookie sheet will probably work.Standard Pyrex roasting pans are also too wide. Two 8"" cake pans will fit but not three without some funky adaptations which will probably throw off baking times.In other words it is fine if you don't cook much. Not for the serious cook with limited space."
2,Marginal at best,"My oven came with chips on the enamel baking surfaces, 3 on the oven and one on one of the slide in trays. It did'nt sit level on the counter and the door didn't close evenly. I sent it back. Looked nice but Quality Control must have had the day off when it was built."
2,Delonghi AR1070 Convection Oven with Rotisserie,"I bought it because of the rotisserie function, which I use a lot. This model has no variable temperature control on that function. There are some things I cook at a lower temperature for a longer time to get the proper doneness. I don't know why when they wired the machine they didn't route that function through the temperature control."
4,Love this oven!,I love this oven! Everything cleans up easily and cooks fabulously. The large interior and classy exterior are a hard combo to beat. Summertime cooking just moved to the deck.
4,Nice but ...,"I received my oven and after a few days I noticed that the top heating element would not stay in place, and that it would drop down towards the food being cooked. The oven is a nice looking appliance, quite big on the counter. It also does not have a toaster setting so you have to use broil and then flip the toast, etc over. [...]"
4,Great Resource for Teacher and Librarians!,I bought this book because I am a Children's Librarian in charge of our Story Times. This book has some great ideas for activities to do with the different ages and levels of the children. I found it very helpful in planning my programs!
2,Not What I expected,"I wasn't sure if this was suppose to be teen book or not. One would think with name and the cover that ""Brazen"" is not a teen read. The story was dragged out to long. I think they should have gotten married and concentrated on there relationship. I don't know but this book was not good at all."
4,nice,"this is better than lots of new agey cds, but I have quite a few that I like better. It's worth getting if you want a collection...if you teach relaxation or do bodywork, however, if you are just looking for one or two amazing, knock-your-socks-off cds, I'd keep looking. I have more than a few to recommend...I'll make a few lists one of these days soon..."
3,Eagle River,"While not as good as some of his other CD's, this is still a nice, relaxing CD when one is stressed out."
3,Dry mouth patient reviews Biotene gum.,"I like chewing gum for my dry mouth, but Biotene is not my favorite: it is expensive, hard to find, and, in my opinion, not any better than many traditional chewing gums. You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra. It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth. Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum. (I do like Biotene toothpaste , though.)"
2,Not a fan,"This stuff is expensive, doesn't stay soft & loses flavor quickly. I could deal with all that if it worked but I just don't think it works any better to relieve dry mouth than regular sugar-free gum."
1,For a more balanced and more historical review,"If Bates is a historian then perhaps he failed to consider the the more historical roots of the controversy. For a more balanced view of the historical roots of the schism see ""The Developing Schism within the Episcopal Church: 1960-2010"" by Nancy C. James, Mellen Press, 2010."
1,Teen-reader,"At first glance this book,Church at War:Anglicans and Homosexuality,looks promising.But once the reader delves into its biased pages, they will not see a fair and balanced book, but a mean spirited, one-sided,and un-polished view. The author, Stephen Bates, portrays conservatives as ( and these are quotes),"" Portly and Red-faced,"" and also,"" Older, white,and mousy."" Keep in mind these are people he obviously does not agree with.When describing liberal people however, he says things like,"" Young, bright and black."" These comments are offensive to me. My vote is a thumbs down."
1,Bates Motel,"Unless you are a liberal, save your money. Stephen ""Norman"" Bates' book belongs in the slasher novel category. He is guilty of lobbing grenades at the orthodox and conservatives. After reading Bates book, the reader can understand why Nigerian Archbishop Akinola and Dr. John Stott didn't grant Bates an interview. Bishop Edward Little must wonder why Bates called him ""mousey"". What a shame Bates, an Oxford historian, marred his book with such an infantile description of Dr. David Virtue. His book fails miserably at helping the warring factions to understand each other. Until Bates gets to a gym, he should refrain from calling others ""portly"". Mercifully, he spared the reader his mug shot."
3,Uplifting and Scary?,"Even though it was the end of the Victorian Era, it was great seeing a woman get published and be able to let others here her views in a time before Second Wave Feminism. However, I think she advocated anti-government tactics that would horrify those of us influenced by Gandhi, Dr. King, and others. No one fears anarchists now, but they were a real threat in her time. Some viewers may see this disc and the content as feminist and empowering; others as violent and creepy. This may be a work good for students, at all levels, who want to know more about early 20th-Century life in America and how immigration affected that."
1,"Should be titled ""Catholic Blathers""","Another apologia from snarky theocon Reverend Neuhaus for the Church's ""Command and Control"" theology."
3,Jumps around,"Part memoir of his early life and conversion to Catholicism, part story of the tumultuous years after Vatican II, part recollection of Pope John Paul II's death and Pope Benedict XVI's election, this book would be better if it were any one of those. As it is, each chapter seems to jump around, covering a lot of ground, but each subject is only briefly touched upon.Fr. Neuhaus is an excellent writer and speaker and there are portions of the book that really shine, like his Rome Diary, but over all, this feels like 6 very long, separate articles from First Things that he tried to stitch together into a book, and unfortunately they don't fit together that well."
3,Well Done,"This was very well written and insightful. I don't think it would persuade those who view themselves as ""progressi ves"" or who otherwise find themselves at odds with the Church. But I do think it provides a well-written consise summary of how a ""traditional"" Catholic views the issues of Truth versus Modernity. This is especially the case for those of us who are not theologians or really into the insider debates involving complex theological terminology"
4,A long and little bit of everything workout,"This is a 96 minute workout so you do get a lot of bang for your buck with this one. There are also about 6 premixes for shorter workout options, including only cardio, upper body, circuits, etc.I would recommend this to people already used to Cathe's choreography as the step workout is fairly intermediate. There are 4 power circuits which are quite good. The part that I found the toughest was the upper body workout using the stability ball.The music is fun, using 80s hits like ""Don't You Forget About Me"" and ""Jessie's Girl"", etc.I wouldn't say this workout is as high intensity as Cathe's IMAX workouts, but it is good for circuit or intermediate step, etc."
5,Great workout!,I love this workout. I do it once a week or once every other week. The step cardio section is fun with great music. I love the intervals with the lower body exercises with the cardio and the upper body and abdominal workout is fabulous. It really helps keep me in shape.
3,Looks great. Otherwise so-so,"Have had this product one year. It looks great. Use it mainly to toast Thomas english muffins. Toast 3 muffins on most mornings. No room to spare. Muffins need to be cut perfectly. It was great at first, but it now takes 2-3 passes to fully toast each defrosted muffin. The heating elements should not be failing at the one year mark. I just ordered a Toaster Oven from Amazon to replace this item. If you want a toaster with the Wow factor, and are willing to accept a high priced toaster with questionable reliability, this may be a good choice. It's that nice looking."
4,Its da bomb!,This CD has lots of tracks which all sound decent. Its a good CD to have especially if you like RNB. Some tunes are quite old but still they are the best.
4,A Book to Cherish,This is a lovely gift book for expectant families - I was particularly drawn to the wonderful photography by Susan Wingate. Ms. Wingate is a talented photographer who so poignantly captures rich emotions and relationships in beautiful black and white images. Mr. Brenner adds enhancement to the images with his poetic and heartfelt words.
2,Set only contains 5 cards!!,"If you own Animal Crossing for Gamecube you can take your game experience further by linking your E-reader and Game Boy to your console. Obviously, you would also need the Animal Crossing-e Cards and the cable that connects your Gamecube to the Game Boy Advance. No problem, more money for Nintendo. What really made me angry was that they don't tell you here is that this set only contains 5 cards! For the full experience you would need to buy this product over and over again until you collected all the cards...ripoff.On the plus side, if you are really, really lucky you might get one of the cards that unlocks one of the two available NES games."
2,The English Dubbing Killed the Movie,"For an old Chinese kung fu movie, it is not bad for the fighting scenes; but the English dubbing made the characters sound idiotic."
2,Little Ugly,This is obviously a craze with kids but the workmanship involved is pathetic for the price.
1,Battered packaging and missing items. Looks used.,"This arrived today taped up in a box that had obviously been opened before. Also, it's missing the AC adapter so I am unable to even use it! Very disappointing..."
4,Does Its Job,Well constructed unit that provides firm lumbar support and conveniences such as a soft reading light and side pockets. Its comfortable enough that even a bad back like mine can enjoy an entire movie on a portable DVD player while sitting up in bed in it. The massage and heat are basic but effective.
1,Stiff as a board,"Everything works and it seems durable. Definitly not relaxing, unless you find it relaxing to sit perfectly straight upright while you read! Don't waste your money. I would send it back but I threw out the box too soon."
4,Relaxation,"I received my product, it was a dark charcoal grey, not black. Is great when sitting in bed, heat and massage function do offer a nice addition to relaxation. WOuld like a better spine fit, otherwise, I love the product!"
4,review for back pillow,"I t is a bit bulky and stiff, agree with previous comments on fabric...heat and massage are nice, I replaced light bulb at radio shack and it is more than adequate...by the way, even xlarge fits in this so I have no idea why the skinny 5'6 lady said she did not fit....I use it against my headboard as well and have never tipped over...I have not seen anything similar on the market...got mine at a church sale for 5.00 so I think it's great....haha"
4,Relaxing and supportive,"I am 5'3"" and the configuration of the back and neck rest work well for me. The light is enough in a dark room yet does not disturb my husband. I am happy with the support it provides when I want to sit up and read. Normal pillows just can't do what this does.I also like the firmness of the cushion. Great product.Only thing I would add is a cupholder."
3,Not Very Comfortable,"This product is comfortable, however only when you put a regular pillow where your back rests. The wires are very hard, and the pillow makes it hard for the massage aspect of the product to work well. The light is always hitting me in the head also. This product does do what is is supposed to, however it is not the most comfortable product on the market. If I could do it over agian this is not the product I would choose."
2,Orbit Oscillating Sprinkler,"This product worked just fine for a few days. Then something came undone in the oscillating mechanism. I found this to be unfixable and called the company I purchased it from. The representative was very sympathetic, said she would talk with the Manager and that I would receive an email in response. Because by that time the sprinkler wouldn't work at all and I was ready to return it. The email came 48 hrs later and in it they said credit would be issued and I didn't even have to return it. I also heard from Amazon.com at the same time via email saying credit was being issued to my credit card.The response to my problem was quick and efficient. Thank you very much.Trudy"
1,"Engage Workers First, then talk about PRICE","Great ideas if anyone can find government workers or teachers who know anything or care about ...budgets.Focus on getting workers engaged in the planning process first before introducing even the word BUDGET or PRICE of Government.Also, using the terms PERMANENT and CRISIS in the same sentence does absolutely nothing except cause eyes to glaze over."
3,Simons Novels,"In this skin is a good book. However it is not Clarks best work. I have been reading Simon Clarks novels for years and I have to say if you have never read a Simon Clark novel dont start here. Please read ""Blood Crazy, King Blood or vampiric.I dont agree with the comment that its bad writing. It doesn't lack a story, also if you had read any other books by Simon you would know that he likes to tell the same story from many different characters point of view.I gave this book 3 stars which is still good and I will always place Simon Clark over Stephen King everytimeBuy this book its only a few $$, you cant even go to cinema for that."
1,This book is terrible,"I bought this book on clearance for $1.00 and I think I over paid. This book reads like a child's essay that had to meet a certain number of words and so many pages. There is an excessive amount of repeating what was just said. Chapters are only 1-2 pages long if that. The story has no flow and over all was quite a challenge to get through because it failed to keep me interested. For the record I did finish the book, but usually I never get rid of any book due to the fact that I might want to re-read it again in the future. Let me say with ultimate conviction that this book will be going to goodwill. Don't waste your money. Some of the other reviews say this author's other books are better, but right now I'm gunshy due to the old saying, ""Fool me once shame on you....Fool me twice shame on me."""
3,Good Game... but doesn't follow storyline,"now unless Vorador's death is explained in defiance2 that is one big error, for all those who do not know, in Blood Omen Vorador dies at the hands of the Saraphan whilst Kain was on his quest to revive the pillars... and this game takes place sum 600 years later (400 years after blood omen was the war and 200 years after that is Kain's awakining)The Game is fun to play, with all of the cast from the previous games coming back to voice over.I was actually expecting to see Kain raise Raziel in this game, but i was left in the dark, alot of questions about kain's past is still left un answered...this games is really a filler story to the actual one of Legacy of Kain, and therefore there really isnt that much of one, especally compaired to the others.This game gets only 3 stars, because it just doesn't fit into the Kain continuum..."
3,"Blood Omen2-The part vampire, part human, part crap game","This game was a great game. I rented it and played it for the 2 days I rented it as a new release. I had just met the seer and had to return it. Then I walked next door and bought it at Wal*Mart. BIG Mistake. It seems the copy at blockbuster was the golden copy. After that the rest of the game is glitchy and bad voice over. There is no replay value. You get frustrated by the bad combat control.By the way, every boss is a puzzle fight. It's always hit hit, flip switch, throw into steam. Do that 3 times and the boss is dead. Rent this game.(Note:My copy was not a glitchy copy. I wnet to my friends house and played his blood omen 2. same thing. also wasn't the playstation2 either)"
1,Stop don't do it... Buy lottery tickets if you need to throw away your money,It is bad... The graphics are poor the game is lacking in so many ways. Story does not mesh with the Soul Reaver series (which is worth buying). It was dull and boring... I can not stress how bad it is. Save your money.
2,Not USB 2.0,"Sure it is my fault for not checking on this previously, but it isn't listed anywhere on this site, and this item is the same price as other 16' active extensions that are 2.0 in other brands....So BEWARE, this item is ONLY USB 1.1 and is not up to the USB 2.0 speeds."
1,USB 1.1 only!,Note that this cable is a slow USB connection and will slow down the peripherals connected to it to USB 1.1 speed! This was not noted in the product description.
4,Good info for those studing British history,"Sometimes I get confused reading British history and they start throwing out titles and ""Lord"", ""Sir"" or titles for people in government. This book helped me sort out what these meant and helped dispell some misconceptions I had about Heraldry too."
5,Great book!,"I just read this book out loud to my 11-year-old niece for the fun of it (though she could have read it herself). She squealed with delight with the adventure and suspense at every turn. ""I LOVE this book!"" she kept saying over and over. ""This book is SOOOOOO good!"" I couldn't put it down either and we stayed up late that night gripped by the book and finished it the next day. Its discussions of tracks, snow and weather conditions, and how to be responsible in the outdoors are credibly accurate yet seamlessly woven into the story. And the messages that we are capable of caring for others, believing in ourselves, thinking our way through difficulties, and fully meeting life's challenges are invaluable for children, especially girls."
3,Not the best Dick Tracy serial,"This is the 3rd of 4 Dick Tracy movie serials, as usual it features Ralph Byrd as Tracy, and that is pretty much where the similarity between the serials and the comic strip end. And in typical serial fashion there are fights galore, lots of chasing, but it's all good fun, if you are interested in the Tracy serials, this wouldn't be the one to start with. For some extra fun keep count of how many hats Dick loses throughout the 15 chapters!"
5,The best of the four Dick Tracy serials,"Well, I think so anyway. Bill Witney and John English directed the three sequels to the original and established themselves and Repulic studios as masters of the serial genre with the choreographed fights, well crafted chapter endings, and overall care in making these entertaining.I put this one above the other Dick Tracy serials because they really outdid themselves in packing it with continuous action and imaginatively crafted scenes including ones in the middle of chapters which rivaled the chapter endings. This one does have a higher body count than most serials. There are six suspects who may be the invisible ""Ghost"" at the beginning and only two still alive by the start of the final chapter.One very unusual thing to note is that unlike most of Republic's crime serials, there is no ""economy chapter"" in which we have flashbacks to scenes in previous chapters.If you enjoy serials, you should love this one."
3,great book,"this book explain basic things like logistic and supply chain, but don`t get deeper in it, the bes book ever for logistic and supply chain management is STRATEGIC LOGISTIC MANAGEMENT, FROM JAMES STOCK AND DOUGLAS LAMBERT MCGARW HILL"
4,"Love it, priceyyy","Love what I can do with it except that the arm cannot go up or down verticaly. Mine came with a defect so i could not hide one of the bolts with a provided black cap, I found out after I installed it and I dont feel going through the process of a return. expensive but worth it"
5,This original release is a steal.,"This performance has just been re-released at three times the price. Get this original version, enjoy the wonderful dancing, and make your mother proud of your shopping ability. Ananiashvili is the star and deserves all the superlatives you can think of. Fedeyetchev is a powerful dancer and a pleasure to watch, although his acting is not as engaging as Nina's. But the performance is enjoyable throughout with no let-downs or disappointments. Watch for the Hedy Lamarr-like dancer in the gypsy camp."
5,Great foundation,"This is definitely one of the best foundations I have ever used. It has great coverage, is very shine-free, and has exceptional staying power. The only foundation that comes close to it is Maybelline's liquid mineral foundation. I recommend both of these products!"
1,Not so good,"The mousse feels like it has a great texture but it leaves the worst cakey, matte finish on your skin that just looks horrible and VERY washed out. I even tried applying it lightly with a high end cosmetic brush and it was still awful. I would stay away from this one and even would recommend liquid foundation over it, but ideally if you can fork out the cash go for Bare Minerals foundation and you will not be disappointed. Cheers."
5,"Emile Henry Butter Pot,",recieved an Emile Henry Butter Pot as a gift. I have enjoyed it so much I have decided to gift my friends for their special days with one.
3,Broke Mine on Day 2,"I LOVE the red color, I like the fact that the container holds 2 cubes of butter. Before buying, I did read that the holder was slippery when wet, and in spite of my being careful, I broke mine because I lost my grip on it due to it being wet. The product is a great concept, and I bought this one because of the color and the capacity, however I wish they would design it a bit differently-perhaps more like the Butter Bell--so that you have something to grab on to.In the mean time, I'll try to Super Glue the holder together."
1,The Book is Fine BUT,"is FULL of errors. Many, many typos make it a task to read...the publisher really messed up on this. Sledge deserves better than this."
4,"A follow up to ""With the Old Breed""","I read this as the follow up to Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"". ""Old Breed"" ended a bit abruptly (which apparently was due to editors and not Sledge) and ""China Marine"" finishes off Sledge's emotional journey. I'd recommend reading it if you've read ""Old Breed"" and want to ""listen"" to Sledge some more. He continued the same conversational writing style which I enjoyed reading.This memoir does not have the impact of ""Old Breed"" but is a worthwhile follow up to ""Old Breed"". I'd recommend it as such."
5,Very sensitively written,"The book reminded me of Herbert Werner's Iron Coffins and Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier. All are written in a remarkably sensitive manner. I particularly appreciated the author's candid discussion of his ""decompression"" period, once returned to civilian life, and how he dealt w/ his PTSD."
3,China Marine,"I liked this book, but it wasn't the equal to Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"". Reads hard at first, Post-War observations are tedious to get through. After awhile it reads well. Took awhile to get through. It is interesting how Post-War chinese, who were fighting a Civil War with the Communists react to American Marines stationed there, who are supposed to keep neutral."
4,A man who made history,"China Marine is the first person account of a WWII Marine veteran who lived through the hell of combat only to be sent to China after the war to help in a time other history books skip and the collective memory of society has forgotten. This book is a vehicle to increase understanding of this vital and volatile time in our history, and to increase appreciation for the guys like ""Sledgehammer"" who did their duty and lived (or died) in hell. This book may not be a great literary work, but it is well told in provides insight into the psyche of those who have earned the right to be understood."
5,Great Finish,"Finally getting to read Eugene Sledge's account on what went on after the abrupt ending to ""With the Old Breed"" was well worth the wait. I wished I had read them both back to back though. Sledgehammer's writing style was still quite clear and evident and it was easy to tell the effect of the duty in China as well as the personal relationships made there had a great impact on him. Definitely a must read if you've read ""With the Old Breed."
1,wrong book inside the right cover,"A weird thing happened with his book: the cover is the right one but inside there is another book titled ""Common Morality"", by Bernard Gert, Oxford Press 2004ISBN 978-0-19-531421-2. I guess someone made a mistake in the printing house. I do not know what to do with it now. It is not what I like to read."
3,China Marine,"This book was the real ending for E.B. Sledge's book ""With the old Breed"". It described his units involvement in China after the war and his return home, obtaining his education, marriage,children and career. It was interesting, but not as captivating as his first book. But it did bring everything to a conclusion for the reader. I do recommend it for all fans of his first book ""With the old Breed""."
1,Fooled By A Feeling CD Review,"The greatest thing about this compilation is the number of rare cuts that were digitally remastered and included on it. ""Take Care Of You"", ""Look What Love Has Done"" (one of Mandrell's best cuts ever!!) and ""It Can Wait"" were placed on it and makes Mandrell fans yearn for more of the same type of compilations! Her singles with her MCA tenure were spectacular, but, by the same token, some of her album cuts were equally as compelling!!Other standouts on this CD are more of her lesser-known Top Tens like ""Fooled By A Feeling"", ""Only A Lonely Heart Knows"", ""No One Mends A Broken Heart Like You"" and ""Hold Me""!This collection is WELL worth the purchase as far as a break in the repetitious compilation releases of Mandrell's over the last few years! Please, MCA Records - put together more of Barbara's releases like the ones included on this CD!"
5,The Best Of B. J. Thomas Gospel Live,I truly love listening to this CD. When he sings The Old Rugged Cross it reminds me why I love that old hymn so much. Excellent.
1,Disappointing,"I have always loved B. J. Thomas' rendition of Mighty Clouds of Joy, but this Live album and its jazzy version of traditional songs was a huge disappointment. So much so that I returned the CD after hearing most of it. Having heard the previous versions of the same songs by B. J., I can say that this CD and its renditions have not aged well."
2,OK,Different design on handle than what was shown. The design shown was the reason for the purchase. Real cheap steel.
2,Not new,The knife came with a different design than the picture. There are scratches on the side and the blade is dirty.
3,My Thoughts...,This band has a real hip hop flavor...Their R&B style with the DC home Go-Go flavor has the DC audience very interested. The only problem is they don't have a complete original old school audience nor an orginal Go-Go conductor.. If you ask me I would incorporate one of orginal Go-Go maestro's such as Lil Benny or Funk... into one or two larger shows.
5,Outstanding,"This CD provides both great music and a look into bebop as it was beginning to make its mark on the American musical scene. In addition to Dizzy and Bird, the musicians include Al Haig, Curly Russell, Max Roach, Big Sid Catlett (on two tracks), and Don Byas (on one track). The sound has been very nicely cleaned up with digital technology, the tunes (four written or co-written by Dizzy) are excellent, and the playing is superb. The photographs, most taken very close in time to the performance, are a nice bonus.Highly recommended for both its historical importance and the quality of the music."
5,Ahhh the music's so good I could just lie down and kill myself!,ahh the music is so good i could just lie down and kill myself!!!!! lol
4,Good to hear them stretch out,"When I began listening to Bebop (song 2), I was disappointed - it sounded like the mic's weren't in the same hall as the musicians. The sound quickly gets better, and is pretty good except the bass is hard to pick out. The songs are about as long as more ""modern"" albums from the 50's, so that's a revelation. The 4 Dizzy songs are among his best and most familiar.I only give it 4 stars because Diz and Bird blitz through the solos. They aren't very memorable. Also, 'Hot House' doesn't do much for me. The Quintet At Massey Hall has better playing - you can hear the musical growth in the eight years between Town Hall & Massey Hall.I recommend this because if you don't have a lot of Diz or Bird this is an interesting example of their playing. If you have a lot of Diz & Bird you'll want it to complete your collection."
1,"""discovery of the century""? no. white elephant of the century","some lost tapes should stay lost. avoid the hype. your precious music dollar can be much better spent elsewhere. these guys are phoning it in for whitey here. look to savoy for a much finer taste of parker. look to allen eager for a suprisingly fresh period bob voice rarely heard. yes, parker at his best was great. but lets not worship every known poop from these sacred cows."
5,Excellent reference for horse breeders,"This book takes you from start to finish, it not only gives a general summary, but some important details too."
5,power with nature,"I had already built 10-60 watt solar panels when I bought this book, but I am grid-tied now and this book has really heightened my awareness as to what I need to become grid-free, because of the input I received on batteries and chargers and inverters.Great book and really funny at times."
2,Too metaphoric,"If you are a creative type that prefers abstract thinking and colorful visualizations, then this book is for you. For the rest of us, I found little use for it. In fact, I found it annoying with dogs and cats becoming part of the energy grid and talking animals demanding new parts for the author's systems. Frankly, if my pets started talking to me, I'd be concerned. I had to read other books first, before I could even begin to understand what the author was talking about. Not a good book for linear thinkers."
4,Want just facts? Skip the fable at the beginning.,"Obviously some reviewers couldn't get past the fable at the beginning of this book. If you enjoy a good yarn, read the fable. Rex is a great storyteller. If you only read for the nuts and bolts, skip the fable. Rex covers the nuts and bolts, in detail. He has a wealth of hands-on personal experience with solar and wind systems. That makes for more useful descriptions of how to do stuff, and more honest appraisals of whether you need to. This is real-world experience talking. Learn from his mistakes. Rex has an engaging, folksy way of explaining highly technical stuff that's easy to understand, and fun to read. He covers everything you need to know about, whether you're off-the-grid, or selling your excess electrons to your friendly local electric utility. Lots of great pictures, graphics and sidebars to keep it interesting. This is one of the best, maybe THE BEST, renewable energy intro book available."
1,2nd Ed. doesn't add much to the 1st Ed.,I love this book and give the original edition five stars but was disappointed that the 2nd edition didn't give a whole lot of additional info. Save your money and pick up a used 1st edition.
4,Jones offers a strong defense,"Clarence offers a strong defense for anyone caught in the unfriendly glare of a TV camera. If you follow Joens' advice step-by-step, you will come across in your best possible light."
1,"This is a technology 'review', not a technology reference.","I am an engineer who purchased this book seeking low level details that described file and data formats such that I could write software which interpreted, analyzed, compressed, or displayed compressed video. This book is written for salesman and marketing people who need a high-level description of the various types of video compression and formats without going into any implementation deails. The front cover highlights on insided content is misleading. A totally useless book for engineers - save your money."
4,Not by Little Richard - by Little Anthony (1980),"Many R & R singers have recorded full gospel abums, including Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Dion, Al Green...and Little Anthony.The latter has delivered a very well produced and deeply felt collection, which should be bought by fans and at least *heard* by anyone who has loved ""I'm On The Outside, Looking In"".New ballad, ""Reach Up"", should be in any Best Of Anthony collection. A wonderful Gospel song."
3,This product seemed very basic -- I'm sure ...,"This product seemed very basic -- I'm sure it works great at cleaning your teeth, but I typically look for other added benefits in a toothpaste (i.e. whitening, tartar control, etc.). It has the same great minty flavor as all other Colgate toothpastes. It's inoffensive, but I'd recommend Colgate Total."
4,"This product passed the test with the kids, ...","This product passed the test with the kids, who are pretty picky about their toothpaste. The taste was good, which is important in making kids brush regularly. I'd recommend this product to family and friends and we'll be purchasing more."
5,Dave Vogler's essay is hilarious!,"Designer David Vogler always contributes to these design books churned out by Mr. Heller. And once again, Vogler has cooked up a hilarious editorial that thumbs it's nose at the industry while making valid observations. This is worth the cover price alone. My staff laffed out loud."
3,Awesome Tapping & Castanet Performance.,"Flamenco is divided into: Cante(song), Guitar, and Dance.If Cante is your thing, then don't buy this DVD, 1st part has no cante & the recording in the 2nd part is terrible (the sound keeps fading in & out).If Guitar is your thing, then don't buy this DVD, the camera hardly focus on the guitar player, and as I said, the sound recording keeps fading in & out.If Dance is your thing, then you should definitely buy this DVD, but keep in mind this is not the Pure Gypsy Flamenco Dance, this is more the Commercialized Flamenco Dance with a lot of Tapping & Castanets which were added to Flamenco Dance for Tourist Attraction."
2,I just didn't like it.,"Film quality is good, but performances are riddiculous. Maybe shall please flamenco experts.Performances were filmed in black and white and participants are very old stiled flamenco dancers."
4,for die-hard mecha fans only,"This is definitely an anime to get if you are a die-hard mecha or drama fan. Other viewers however might get a bit bored after wading through numerous scenes promoting the political and spiritual aspects of the plot. The fight scenes are sparse and short compared to other mechas such as Evangelion and Macross. The mech designs in Gasaraki are unique and realistic (as far as weaponry is concerned) and their battles are fun to watch despite its shortness in length at times. This is definitely an anime to get if you have the patience to watch the whole series through as it develops, but not for those looking for a fast-paced high-action mecha anime fix."
4,"Excellent, a worthy addition","Without a doubt the Japanese have been watching the X-Files. This is X-Files meets Evangelion. It is mysterious and pulse pounding. The mechs are believable, and move realistically.The protagonist of this story is a mysterious dancer, who is a member of a powerful japanese family. They have somehow merged some supernatural forces for military applications, and our hero is the key to it.Animation is excellent, and english dub is excellent. I left the language on English because it was so good.Like the X-Files and Evangelion, all you need is one to get you hooked. The story and conspiracy plots will keep you coming back.The reason this didn't get 5 stars is that I don't like the way the mechs look. But that is just me."
4,An Evangelion clone?,"If you enjoyed Evangelion, you'll probably like Gasaraki. Heck, this is practically a carbon copy of Evangelion with its political intrigue, secret projects, terrific mecha, and two gloomy main characters who could be clones of Rei Ayanami. The four episodes on this DVD start off the series in much same way Eva starts off- right in the middle of things, leaving you with plenty of unanswered questions. The animation is very impressive for a TV series and the overall atmosphere is enhanced very well by the music which combines martial themes with Noh music. And the mecha! They're not flashy, but if combat mecha actually existed, they would probably look like this.Although Gasaraki may seem like an Eva rip-off, it's still quite enjoyable, especially if you like your anime with realistic mecha and lots of politics."
2,Uhh... What's Everyone Raving About?,"Let me start off by saying, I thought the Patlabor films were brilliant and Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the all time best series. However, Gasaraki doesn't come close to either. The animation is nice and the mecha designs are neat but to put Gasaraki in the same league as a NGE boggles the mind. Gasaraki's story is far too sloppy and conveluded to keep me interested at all. Furthermore the characters are hardly likable including Mr. dancing kabuki man. Two words sum up Gasaraki, pretentious and boring."
2,Nice animation but kinda boring,"I picked this video up under the assumption that it was something like Gundam and Evangelion. It is, and it's not particularly original. The animation is better than a lot I've seen, but that's one of the few good things I can say about it. The characters are monotonous and the story line is too confusing to get anything out of. The mecha is realistic but boring. I'm completely lost on the whole Noh thing! This video didn't offer me anything I hadn't seen anywhere else, and to top it off, it was confusing and boring, so I can't really reccomend it."
2,not for me,"I thought that this series was going to be as good as Neon Genesis, but it dosen't come close. In Those regards it is nothing like that series at all. There is this espionage thing going on, there is this mecha thing going on, and there is this crazy dancing stuff. What does it have to do with each other? They never explain it in these four episodes, and all these elements feel like seperate different anime themes just thrown into the mix. The anime itself has some good art to it, but without the story to back it up you find yourself baffled while watching it. At times you felt that there was a build up to some excitement, an explanation, or even something interesting, but the episode would just end at that point. The next episode would not build on this excitement, but would just add more elements to the unexplained story. The overall feel is that you started watching this in the middle of the series. If you like espionage, mechas, and crazy things then this is right to your tastes."
4,Gasaraki - Volume 1 - The Summoning,"Intrigued by the artwork and content, I was also inundated with confusion. It's a little hard to follow, and a little slow to begin with. The creators of Gasaraki seem to just jump right in, mid-story, and proceed without explanation. Although, I was captivated by the combination of traditional Japanese dance sequences and military efforts to invoke some sort of sentient being. Highly captivating, one that must be watched closely, Gasaraki is beautifully done. Do you like waffles?"
4,Uncle Daddy,"When I think about reading Uncle Daddy, love comes to mind. This book is very loving in so many ways. There is love from friends, family, ones who were known for short amount of time and love from others that were never really known. This book is a very easy to read book with a good story line to it. If you have troubles comprehending what you read or want something easy that¡s entertaining, this would be a good book for that. I enjoyed this book because I don¡t like stories that are hard to understand. I like simple books that are good. I really recommend it!"
5,A Bit Corny but Absolutely Delicious!,"This combo cd recorded is absolutely is perfect for anyone who loves or even likes Steve & Eydie. All the songs are catchy, perky and delightful. Simply listening to this cd will make you happy. The sweetness of their youth and marriage is evident in every song. My husband, who is a die-hard ""60's man (Dylan, Collins, Baez) even gets a charge out of it! Nothing beats Eydie's Applie Blossom Time!"
2,this is your parents' music...,"...because my parents hung out with them on the beach in Beach Haven, NJ. My dad always said, ""If you ain't behavin', you ain't goin' to Beach Haven."" Well we did, and we hung out with Steve and Edye.It was like having an extra pair of parents. They wouldn't stop singing. They sang after dinner, breakfast, lunch. They sang on the beach to a crowd of ten while Edye was polishing Steve's back with the coppertone. Oh, what memories!"
2,If it weren't for the illustrations.....,"The eerie life-like pictures in this book are exquisite. Dolores Avendano keeps your interest in this book when the words fail. She hides two little kids on each page whom are fun to look for and find. This is a poetic counting book from 1 to 13 in honor of Halloween. Every page ends with '...on halloween night. Oo-oo-oo-ooh.' Even though a few of the words change from page to page, the repitition is boring and uneventful."
2,Not the same as his original recordings from the 60's-70's,"I purchased this CD because my parents have a Christmas album of various artists and songs with Gary Puckett singing the most beautiful version on Oh Holy Night ever recorded. I was so disappointed that he did not sing the song the same on this CD. It was mediocre at best. In fact, he doesn't even sing all of the verses on this CD. Oh well, I tried!"
2,Very stilted,"I didn't know Gary Puckett had a Christmas album out till this evening...I read a few of the reviews but when I heard sample tracks (luckily I didn't have to pay for them....) I thought, no, this is not for me. I was not expecting the Union Gap and I know Gary has aged a little...ok, not so ""little"" and his voice is still powerful but much of what I heard was out of tune and very stilted and stiff. Not smooth at all, I didnt hear any warmth or feeling in it. Good voice...typical Christmas songs...but somehow, the voice and the songs just didn't meld. Disappointing, in my opinion."
3,Nauseating: old food smells mixed with a strong almond scent.,Worked like a dishwashing liquid. My husband hated it and I grew to hate it. It has a strong almond scent which I loved at first but that strong almond scent mixes with the dirty food your washing off the dishes and it is disgusting. I started to get nauseous when I washed the dishes. When this box was done I bought a dishsoap with lemon and never looked back. It'll take a while before I can smell almond again.
3,"Be careful not to use too much, especially in water bottles!","I have purchased this dish soap twice and while I love the scent and the price, I have realized that you must be careful to use a very, very, VERY small amount when washing things like water bottles, coffee traveler mugs, etc. I have a couple of Sigg water bottles (LOVE them!) and have noticed an almost unbearable scent and taste of the soap whenever I wash them. Don't get me wrong, the almond scent is great, but not when you can actually taste it! I have not experienced this with other natural dish soaps, so just be careful!"
3,I like many Earth Friendly Products...,"I don't care for this detergent. It is watery, does not make suds, and doesn't seem to be an effective cleaner. I prefer Seventh Generation, Planet, or my fave - Stonewall Kitchen (pricier, but fab!)"
2,poor cleaning unless applied larvishly,"I did not buy this from Amzon, but would like to warn potential buyers that this product is only 1/5 to 1/10 of the cleaning power of Dawn dish detergent, despite the boasting on the label that '""ultra Dishmate"" is very concentrated'. I need to squirt it on my sponge 5-10 times during my dish washing which used to require just one squirt of Dawn. The contrast between its claim and cleaning result is so big that made me wonder how ""earth friendly"" this product really is. Not recommended."
2,Damaged bottles...,Don't really like the scent and it feels like water down dish detergent..also some bottles are leaking due to the poor packaging.
3,Not as concentrated as I would've liked,"I ordered this product because it was all natural. After trying it, however, I found that because it is not as concentrated as other dish detergents, I went through an entire bottle of 25 oz in about a month. Our last detergent required us to use only half as much this one. So, although I like the fact that it is all-natural, I don't think I'll buy it again. If I don't find another natural dish detergent that suits me, I guess I'll just have to go back to Dawn..."
2,Short box very slick,"the stamina short box may be easy to buy and it is less expensive than Stott, but beware! the top fabric is very slick, so my clients start to slid off as they press back. Very annoying~"
2,Bad review book for LSAT,"I got this book 2 weeks ago, I am about 3/4 way through the whole book, so I think I am fairly qualified to rate this book now.It sucks! As with most Princeton Review materials, this book is really chatty, it talks a lot, but gives you very little information.The overall oganization of the book is poor. Main points are not emphasized enough.And here is the worst part, I don't think their technique is all that useful on the test. Most of their strategies are really time consuming, if anyone follows the steps they outlined, this person would be lucky if he can complete half the exam. Oh yeah, the book constantly tells you to skip questions. That is not a good strategy to me, to skip things. The two practice LSAT included with the book are not real exams, they are made up by Princeton Review.This book is okay for overview, to give you an idea about LSAT, but to really prepare youself to be ready for LSAT, you should look elsewhere."
5,Drowning Anna,"Drowning Anna is a great book where a 13 year old girl moves to a new town and is a straight ""A"" student. She becomes friends with a girl named haley parkin and they are great freinds and just when it seemed that their friendship is growing stronger, haleyy all of a sudden isn't Anna's friend anymore. Anna doesn't understand and becomes friends with Melanie Blockwood who is in some of her other classes. It starts out in present tense then Melanie takes you back to where it all started. it got worse and worse. Anna couldn't handle the pressure of all that taunting and teasing (pretending to be her friend one day and the next she hates them). It got to the point where Haley was violent. Anna started cutting her arms and her mom tried to fix the problem but it only got worse. Anna OD's and is sent to the hospital where it a ll begains to unfold."
3,Book Review of Drowning Anna,"When smart, talented, and beautiful Anna Goldsmith moves to town she soon makes a friend. Hayley and Anna become great friends. Though as soon as Anna settles down in her new town, Hayley starts to insult and bully her.Hayley also hurts Anna physically. Soon Anna feels she can't take it anymore. So Anna does something drastic that no one could have anticipated.This book is told through many perspectives: the reading of Anna's diary, her parents and her only friend, Melanie. This is a great book describing the cruelties of teens.This book is an excellent story because it tells you the truth and all the details of what it's like being bullied. It's also is hard to put down, because the author writes an amazing story."
5,Excellent Book,The book Drowning Anna is definatly an excellent book it kept me turning the pages. This was the first book i read by Sue Mayfield and i truly think shes a incredible author. This book really helps people understand that no matter what if people are bullying u and bringing u down or have turned there back on u there is no reason to blame it on yourself..always be true to yourselfthere were moments i have to say where i cried in the book because it got so sad..but this book is definatly a must read!!
5,One of a kind!,"B.P.M. is unlike any rap I have ever heard. It is a mix of old-school and jazz, but his style is so smooth and laid back that you can't help but love it the first time you hear it. This is one of my favorite albums and I would recommend it to anyone who remotely likes gospel rap."
5,TWO GREAT VOICES SINGING GOD'S PRAISE!,HOW THANKFUL I AM THAT THESE TWO WOMEN GOT TOGETHER ANDSANG THE PRAISE OF OUR LORD! OUR EARS HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH THEIR JOYOUS AND BEAUTIFUL VOICES! GREAT BUY AND A LORETTA LYNN AND/OR PATSY CLINE FAN GOTTA-HAVE! SUSIECOOL
2,Incorrect picture,The picture is wrong. Its not the thermometer that sale. Sending a thermometer without Centigrades scale. Not that i want. Attention please.
5,Very versatile!!!!,Hangs out of the way in several positions in both the refridge or freezer. Easy to read from all positions.
2,Can't read with a magnifier!,"I bought this and one of the metal standikng ones. I will buy a couple more of those, since this one is quite impossible to read. It also fogs over by the time you've tilted it enough to try to see it. The simpler metal ones with the arrows are cheaper and easier to read and appear quite accurate."
2,"It""s OK",I was hoping it would be easy to read. It does hang on an angle so you need to lift it up to try to read it.
3,Update to information,My wife remembered this album from when she was a kid. So I ordered it for her. The album is an import from Japan so much of the writing is in Japanese. But the songs themselves and much of the text inside are in English.We had to risk it since Amazon didnt know if it's in English. Wanted to make sure future purchasers know that it's in English.
2,Not enough songs!,"The CD cover is the same as the old LP we had purchased in the 1970s, the title was the same too, but the content was only seven songs compared to thirteen on the original. It was quite disappointing, but when I notified Amazon.com of this, their response was speedy and most satisfactory. Delivery of the CD was prompt, arriving exactly on the day it was expected, so while I was disappointed in the lesser content of the CD compared to the LP, I was more than happy with the service provided by Amazon.com."
3,Hmmm...,"Well, I'm not necessarily a fan of the Daleks unless the overall production makes them either truly frightening or campily funny. ""Genesis"" tries to do the former and fails miserably...at least for the tastes of someone my age. Children might be impressed, though. The Daleks are slow and stupid and none of the actors do a really good job except for Baker and the ones who play Nyder and Davros. The plot is well-paced, though, even for six episodes.I think the real treat here is ""Sontaran Experiment"", a grim run through the heath that used to be London and is now a wilderness with not even an animal alive and a sinister alien skulking among the rocks and abducting hapless castaways. Very eerie and well-acted by all, but only two episodes long, so it can't raise the rating.Overall, not bad and not great."
5,"An excellent set and a great place to get ""into"" Dr. Who","This two tape set is a great place to start into Doctor Who. First, you get the Sontaran experiment. The story is short, interesting, and good enough to ""whet the appetite,"" so to speak. And the Harry/Sarah/Doctor combination is excellent.Genesis of the Daleks is a fabulous story to be caught up in. An intricate tale that is both brutal and sophisticated. Michael Wisher as Davros and Peter Miles as Nyder play their parts to perfection, able to convey their manipulative characters with authenticity. This is also a great place to learn of the Daleks as this is perhaps, without a doubt, their best story. Buy this one with confidence!"
4,Spiroli,Very easy to use and clean. Great for raw food dishes. Time will tell how well the plastic parts hold up.
5,LOVE this item,"This is SO fast, easy to use and the clean up is a breeze. I'm so glad I have it in time for the holiday gatherings. I can present my veggie trays in such attractive shapes. I store mine right in the box so I can see the illustrations on the box. It reminds me of the creative possiblities. Every kitchen should have one of these."
4,World cuisine Tri-Blade Plastic Veg slicer,"I primarily bought this slicer so that I may use it to make raw zucchini spaghetti and I am extremely pleased with it. My raw spaghetti turned out perfect and so yummy! I find that it slices soft veggies & fruit such as zucchini, onion, apple, cucumber and the long, slender eggplant varieties easier than carrots or yams. All in all, I am very pleased with it. It's easy to use and does not take up a lot of space."
1,DISAPPOINTING - NO INSTRUCTIONS,I am very disappointed with this purchase. There are NO INSTRUCTIONS and I have absolutely NO IDEA how to use this product.
5,Easy to use,"As most of us with busy schedules, I'm into quick and easy. I have only used it on zucchini so far and it is definitely easy to set up, spriralize into spaghetti like strands and then clean up. This was definitely worth the price and the convenience."
2,Disappointing,"It is an interesting gadget but not fully developed, at least not as promoted and described. The first time I tried to shred a carrot one of the teeth on the rotating holder broke. I am returning this item. If they improve it can be quite useful, I think."
1,Waste of money,"Flimsy, dollar-store quality. I was afraid I'd break it just taking it out of the box. This is worth $3, maybe. But $30? No way. The shipping alone cost more than the actual worth of this item."
4,A fun new way to encourage raw vegetables,I have enjoyed how easy it is to cut vegetables in a unique way to make them more appealing to my kids. We have also enjoyed baked curly fries too. The spiral cutting of the carrot did not go as smooth as it looked on the box but the rest of the vegetables have turned out well.
5,Paderno Veggie Slicer,"Product works incrediblely well, kids are eating squash and loving it. Easy to clean and store. Product arrived rather quickly and i would recommend this product to anyone."
4,Spiral slicer,"I am very pleased with the performance of this product. It is as promised. The first recipe I made was zucchini spaghetti with a fresh tomato, basil, garlic, parsley sauce. I loved it and so did my husband (who is a real meat and potatoes guy)!"
3,fun but not only if its limitations are met,"I thought this was a fun presentation but only if the right shape, texture and size were met. Therefore it was more limiting than I expected. However the cost also reflected its use. I am happy with this product but it is not a staple in my kitchen."
4,It's worth it!,"Don't let the ""it's plastic"" dissuade you from getting this. I was quite surprised to find that it's sturdy and the blades can handle hard vegetables. Now, all I want to do is ""spiralize"" all veggies. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because, who knows? it may break in 5 years, so I'm leaving room for the uncertain. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got it and recomend it."
3,DO YOU REALLY NEED IT?,"I think is a good buy if you are on a raw diet or want to eat a lot of vegetables. If you don't want to eat pasta, try the yam noodles, they are low carb, if you are worrying about eating to much carbs, which is not my case. I dont think I will buy it again if mine breaks, also when you do the carrots it stains the white plastic, even if you wash it right a way!"
4,Fun & Fast,"What a neat little kitchen gadget! It really does make long noodles out of vegetables. I can make a big bowl of pasta with just one medium sized zucchini. It's simple to use and cleans up in no time. It also has suction cups on the bottom so it doesn't slide everywhere when in use.*The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because 1) the instructions are not helpful at all and 2) there's a safety issue. There are only two slots for storage. So one blade has to be exposed all the time.Also, for the blades that do have slots... Instead of pulling the blade out, push the button to release it. It's really easy. I make vegetable pasta with this all the time."
5,In love<3,I love my new Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer its totally amazing especially if you're someone who wants to be a rawist or wants another alternative to pasta. This product will change my life forever for good.
5,This thing is awesome!!!,"I love this slicer! I recently went raw and I love the zucchini spaghetti and other things I've made with it. It's awesome!! It's easy to use, you get it quickly (i did at least) and it cuts everything so easily! If you are looking for a slicer I think this is the one to get. It's kinda plasticy, but for the price and what it's being used for it's perfect. You'll need a little bit of counter space though if you're going to use it frequently. That's the only thing I don't like (because I like my other appliances so much I don't want too move anything)"
3,not what i expected,I was hoping fo a Japanese style spiral slicer. This is meant for American kitchens. The Japanese have a smaller blade for thinner cutting. I am a Culinary Chef-Instructor and wanted this slicer for a sushi demonstration and it did not measure up.
3,Love the way it works but thinking of returning it because clean up is terrible!,"I love my new spiral slicer for many reasons....especially my zucchini noodles. However...I find it difficult to clean the blades and further this is cheaply made..The slicer wobbles all over the place while you are trying to slice. It has ""feet""...but the ""feet"" don't help hold it steady enough.I don't know if I would have been happier with a different type of slicer or not...but I though I would review this product so that maybe people will investigate furtherinto what sort of spiral slicer they might like."
2,Subpar quality,"I very much looked forward to the spiral slicer and used it a couple of times to create zucchini noodles. However, when I used it on carrots, the plastic turn handle broke and this was the end of it. It looks like the slicer is good for softer vegetables, such as zucchini for example, but not as good for harder vegetables such as carrots although the picture on the product suggests otherwise. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,Works great but plastic!!,"This item works great! We have used it for potato twirls and zucchini. My only problem with it is that it is plastic and can be a bit flimsy. Also, if the piece that holds the vegetable is not positioned just right, the little needle-like peices can get grated as well!"
5,World Cuisine Spiral Cutter,"This product is wonderful. We have had a blast spiraling beets, cukes, zucchini, and other roots effortlessly. I have ordered three of these gadgets total to share with friends and family."
2,"Love it, but.....",This is a great little machine. Does exactly what it says it will quick and easy. Our only problem is that the end of the handle broke on the first use. Of course my husband came up with something using a wrench from his tool box. I would however like to purchase a new handle. It looks like the end of the handle justs screws in. If anyone from world cuisine is reading post please contact me so I can buy a new handle.
3,FOR LIGHT USE ONLY,It is a decent item for the price. If you have light use it may be ok otherwise it may not be able to handle more frequent or heavy tasks.
5,AWESOME!!!!!,A must have. Makes you eat more vegi's! Makes salads fun. String zucchini and use it instead of pasta. Gives a more palatable texture for any vegi! My son will string cucumber and just eat that with nothing on it. I have to buy more vegetables for the house now. A GREAT sign that we are getting triple the amount of vegi's than we used to! YEAH!!!
4,Useful Tool,"Very light weight (which is nice). I love what it can do, but I'm a little concerned it may be over priced."
1,Junk,Parts stick together. Will not do carrots. Manual is not well written and does not cover everything. It is better to spend more money and have something that worked.
1,Plastic handle split within months,"I have been barely using this slicer (less than once a week) and already the plastic handle, which is absolutely essential to slicing the vegetables, is now unusable. I cannot even turn the handle correctly or cut anything. I was wondering if I could get a replacement as I am no longer satisfied."
2,flimsy and bulky,"i have not had much use of it. Got it on friend's recomendation but it is so much easier to just use your reagular peeler, slicer and a simple knife. This is a toy for your kitchen. If you have nothing else to do with your time, go ahead and play with your food. I am too busy. This one is getting recycled as a gift to someone else."
1,Not good,"This product was all thin plastic, and very poorly made. There were no instructions for use included and it was impossible to understand how it would work. I sent it back. Amazon was very good about the return, however."
2,Difficult to operate,"I am still trying to understand this product. I does not really fix the vegetables that I try to work with. Maybe for the time being I don't know how to work it but I will continue trying. The problem I really have with it is that it is made out of plastic and it's not as sturdy as some other products that were made out of metal that did not work either. OK, maybe I am picky but to charge thirty some dollars for something that difficult to work and made out of plastic¡¡¡"
4,Spiralizer,"I used this product with yellow squash and zucchini and made it spiral. I then tossed it with a red sauce and chicken and you get the feel that you are eating spagetti. Works great on almost any vegetable. Be sure and have a good firm, straight surface to adhere it to."
4,Zucchini Pasta,"I bought this because a friend of mine made zucchini into pasta that could sub for regular noodles (small blade). It works great for that! I like that there are three blades. I thought the medium blade would make good sweet potato fries, but the size is too small for that. Still, this machine is definitely worth it just for the pasta. I also used the ribbon blade for eggplant."
4,Pretty Good for 28 dollars..,I've only had the machine for a month. I haven't used all the parts yet. But it works well. small and compact which is good. Good machine for 28 dollars.
4,spiral veggies,"So easy to use, a 3-year old girl was making veggie noodles from zuchinni and sweet potatoes! Cleans quickly. Especially like the blade storage."
4,Tri-blade Spiral veggie slicer,Pros:Comes with 3 seperate attachments that may used for different syle and sized cuts.Has a convenient storage area for 2 of the attachments to be tucked away when not in use.Has suction cups at each corner of the base for movement restriction.Has an extra handle on the side making it easier to push the produce through the cutting implement.Cons:Many pieces to clean but not too difficult to do so.It's plastic.Overall I am happy with this product. It is a good tool for those interested in raw food cuisine. It has definately increased my options for meal preparation and creativity.
5,Great for the price--very glad I purchased this!,"Yes, it's plastic and not metal, and its lifespan will probably be shorter because of it. That said, the plastic makes it lightweight and easy to handle. The suctions cups are tremendous--they really hold the slicer in place! The varying blades are very, very sharp (be careful when washing in a sinkful of sudsy water). And the cleanup is a breeze; I wash in hot, soapy water as soon as I'm done using it. (To clean the blades I highly recommend using a scrub brush.) I am hoping they eventually come out with a set of replacement blades, and maybe even one that makes skinnier noodles (like angel hair pasta). Now that I can make zucchini ""pasta"" I no longer miss wheat pasta at all. :-)AND, since I purchased this slicer, it dropped $5.00 in price--don't hesitate to buy this one, it's fantastic!"
5,Spiral Slicer is a winner,This spiral slicer is so easy to use and makes vegetables look like spaghetti .... great product
4,Great Product,"Great product, poor instructions on how to use tho....buy extra produce for the first time use until you have learned how to make the cuts you want!!"
5,Very pleased,Product meets or exceeds my expectations. Over all very pleased with my purchase and I received it in a very short period of time.
2,"Great concept, poor materials","I was so excited to find this product and use it for the first time. It gave me the most creative zucchini - right up until the handle broke off in my hands on the first use. Then to add insult to injury, AMAZON'S RETURN POLICY IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EASY. It wouldn't recognize my order, and there's no customer service email on the site. This could make a person stop ordering things from Amazon."
4,Great for zucchini noodles!,"After going gluten free I missed spaghetti more than anything. The noodles this makes are great. I use about 2-3 zucchini's for two (big eaters) people and after slicing them up on this, Idrop them in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then take out and immediately run cold cold water over them to stop the cooking. Then I pour the hot spaghetti sauce over them and it's a super quick and super easy gluten free meal that even my (very gluten loving) boyfriend considers one of his favorites! Everyone's happy!"
1,Broke within 5 minutes,"I couldn't have been more disappointed with this product. It is made from a flimsy plastic and literally broke in less than 5 minutes. It couldn't even handle a zucchini, which is one of the softest vegetables you could use. Would love to find a better product to replace this one."
5,Really cool!,"I love this thing. Once you figure out how to use it, it's awesome. Cut the veggie short enough to anchor it and you will have no trouble using it. I love the zucchini noodles."
5,AWESOME!!!,"Love this product!!! We just became Vegan a few months ago and wanted to put some good/fun Raw items into our diet. By spiraling our squash and zucchini I make our ""pasta"" noodles (which the kids think are real pasta and eat them! bonus) and we food process our own sauces out of herbs, tomatoes, ect (make pesto or tomato sauce) and it is a great alternative for lunch or dinner a couple nights a week, only takes minutes to make and seconds to clean up. LOVE IT and would HIGHLY recommend! I watched a 10 minute you-tube demonstration on how to use it because the directions that came with it are one page, but very dark and hard to see."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I really wanted to love this slicer. We are on the Paleo diet and love it but I thought it would be fun to experiment with different types of veggie ""pasta."" The construction of this slicer was far too flimsy and lightweight to handle repeated use and I didn't think it would hold up. I ended up returning it."
3,Sturdier than I thought it would be,"It's easy to think this would be a low quality slicer considering the price. It's not. I'm always a little hard on my kitchen gear and didn't go easy on this just because it is made of plastic. As long as you don't toss it against the wall, it will hold up. I wasn't thrilled with the blade choices though. The ribbon attachment is a little too thin and makes more of a potato chip, nice fries. Same for the spaghetti style blade. It did make very thin, crispy potatoes but I'd use it in the future for nests or some other decorative side, not really for a decent plate of fries. For the price, you get something fun to play with and you can dress up your plates. I'd like to see the ribbon slicer just a bit thicker but will definitely use it again."
1,no way...returned it!,I ordered this and loved it but only for a round large vegetable....otherwise it does not work and I returned it!
4,World Cuisine Tri-Blade Spiral Slicer,"I love this spiral slicer. It's very easy to use, you don't have to apply a lot of pressure for it to work. It has suction feet that actually work and hold the slicer to the counter. Very easy to use and has three different blades."
2,spiral vegetable slicer,"The concept of this slicer is wonderful,,,however, the handle and spokes to be placed in the end of the vegetable to be sliced is a joke. The little spokes, and I mean short little spokes do not stay in the vegetable which then makes it very difficult to use the attached crank. I have had to turn the vegetable itself by hand being very careful not to cut my fingers on the blade.However, the spiral cut vegetables are very unique, taste different from just slicing the vegetable and make salads very healthy because you don't have to heat the veggie...other than the handle apparatus, this machine is good, but perhaps not worth the price I paid..Kay"
5,Absolutely great,"I needed to write this review because I just want people to know how fabulous this product is. I am diabetic and react badly to wheat pasta. I mostly use this spiral slicer with zucchini to create a vegetable pasta-type noodle. I've also used it with daikon radish to make a bean sprout and radish Chinese salad. Its sturdy and cleans up easily. The three different blades give you choices as to type and thickness of your ""noodle."" The instructions are terrible and you have to figure out how to put in and remove the blades. To remove the blade attachment, press in on the back and bottom of the plastic surrounding the metal blade and pull up at the same time. I've given this product to friends as gifts and everyone loves it."
3,Good and Bad features,"For the money this is not a bad spiral slicer considering some list for over 100 dollars. The real sticking point is the fixed forward axle for whatever you are slicing. It consists of a round hollow cutting edge with an approximate 3/8 opening. This simply means whatever you are slicing will lose a 3/8 cylinder from its center. This is accepatable with Cucumbers and Zuchini but does not leave much when slicing Carrots, Raddishes or any other small diameter veggies.I would not recommend this if you intend to use it for these smaller veggies but for potatoes, Apples and the like it is OK."
4,Perfect for veggie spaghetti,I bought this after I returned the Saladacco. I was looking for something to make zucchini spaghetti and this is it! Easy to use and clean and the spaghetti is firm. The Saladacco creates fine garnish type shreds out of carrots but makes a mess out of soft veggies/fruits like zucchini and apples. This has suction cups to keep it from sliding. Requires a little pressure to be applied as you shred but definitely not as arm twisting as the Saladacco. This will not make angel hair pasta since the cutters are not that small.
2,Don't buy it if you expect it to work.,"Used it four times and it does not make spiral pototos as it is supposed to.The center piece slid out the other day and fell on the floor and the handle that you use to move it forward during the cutting process broke off, now I have to push on it where ever I can to move it forward."
1,Get the Saladacco Instead!,"Unfortunately, when I tried to make angel hair out of my zuchini with this spiral slicer, all I got was mush! :-(The Saladacco Spiral Slicer, on the other hand, gave me a plate full of perfect angel hair zuchini! :-)"
1,Worst purchase ever,"I made a mistake when I fell for the advertisement for this product. This was a waste of money, and hopefully I can keep someone else for making the same mistake. The product is clumsy and does not do what it states, period."
4,"Excellent, but not perfect","This item does what it says it will do. I was slightly worried about the plastic construction and the possibility of breaking the handle, but not so much after having used it 10+ times in the last month. I find it excellent for making raw salads out of carrots, parsnips, daikon, radish, zucchini, etc. My only complaint is that I wish it had a blade/spiralizer insert which produced thinner strings -- more like angel hair pasta. The strands it produces are a bit bigger than spaghetti sized. Overall, however, a very good item and I'm definitely eating more vegetables now!"
4,spiral slicer review,I like the product and find it easy to use. The plungers stick to my counter very well holding the slicer in place while I use it. The only thing I wish were different is the large center piece that doesn't get sliced. It would be so nice if it sliced the entire vegitable to the center without wasting any of the vegi. Other than that I think it's a fine slicer.
2,poor Instructions,"I was excited to get my machine but it has not lived up to expectations, the instructions are almost non existant and I still cannot get it to make the spaghetti from the vegetable that I wanted it for so all up a big dissapointment, yet another peice of junk at the back of the cupboard."
4,Great Buy,"Everything about this product, from its durable quality, to the precision of its craftsmanship makes it a good buy.I use it predominantly to make ""spaghetti"" from zucchini as a pasta replacement, and I have to say that I barely miss it.The only thing I have to say is that it should have included an ""angel hair"" cut attachment as well."
4,Great for Fancy Veggies,"I wanted one of these to create interesting raw vegetable dishes, like vegetable ""spaghetti."" It doesn't disappoint. Easy to use and clean up. It could be a little more durable if it was made of metal but then that would just make it more expensive."
4,It's a good product,Ok...it's plastic but it does what it claims to do...I lovethe fact that this has suction cups too - Blades are verysharp - getting the blades out was a bit tricky at first butthen I realized I just neeeded leverage with a spoon.
1,Do not waste your money,"Bought this with excitement, but realized when I opened it to use of course after the return window expired, that the handle turns but the screen inside is stripped. Therefore it won't hold any vegetables to slice, at all. I recommend not buying this, or if you are going to buy something like this get it at Costco where they have an open window of return on all products."
5,Love it,"Easy to use, Easy to clean. Can make many different style spirals. I made spiral squash 'pasta' in less than 2 minutes."
4,Paderno World Cuisine Tri Blade Spiral Vegetable,"It important to choose the right diameter of vegetables. Jicima is perfect. I love working with this gaget. A nice helper for making low carb ""veggie pasta"""
5,Wonderful gadget,"This is a great kitchen gadget that I actually use... Kids are now eating raw zuccini and lots of other things. Even made ""spaghetti"" out of potatoes by spiraling them and then boiling them quickly and adding it to regular spaghetti... fun! Beets, carrots and any other long and thick veggies work great. Easy to clean, just rinse it off."
4,"Easy to use, not so easy to clean","Taking one star off on the cleaning part. I used this to make apple chips, since I don't have a mandolin. The chips are paper thin and dehydrates very well. Since it is white plastic, orangey vegetables can stain the plastic, no biggie though."
5,Great!,"This is well designed, sturdy, easy to use, and gives magnificent results. It's a must for any raw foodie and anyone looking to add variety when eating their vegetables (like myself). It's not just for squash either, I've never had such an easy time slicing an onion! The small ""noodle"" blade worked so well on cucumber that my carb-loving husband said he didn't need to have pasta anymore! Zuchinni noodles with meat sauce, a creative Greek salad on a bed of spiraled cucumbers, cinnamon sugar apple strands... the list goes on!"
5,Such a cool device,"I didn't believe you could replace pasta with something healthy, and have it taste good, but this does just that. My favorite thing so far is cucumber pasta. I didn't even like cucumbers prior to trying this! I placed the cold spiralized cucumbers in a bowl, then placed a combination of heated Kirkland (Costco) brand marinara (75%) with Kirkland Salsa (25%) on top, then sprinkled with a little parmesan. Sooooooo good! I couldn't believe how good it was, and just how great of a pasta substitute this would be. I wish it wasn't plastic, I hide it in a cupboard because of the platic, but I still very highly recommend this device. I think kids would love the cucumber spaghetti too, which would be a huge plus."
2,poor design,"The spiralizer isn't easy to use, and I think the design is wrong. The suction cups don't stay put, which makes it impossible to apply enough pressure to cut the vegetable."
2,does not cut but rather mutilates,"maybe i am using this with the wrong vegetables/fruit.......... apples, potatoes, sweet potatoes. i tried all the blades with the cuts as directed in the directions and this cut very poorly, if you could call it cutting. when cutting apples, it cut so thinly that the apple pieces fell apart with all blade options. i tried the curly attachment with potatoes and it cut such tiny/thin curly sections that they would not fry properly in the fryer. forget even trying a sweet potato with this toy. as i said, perhaps these items are not meant to be cut with this and i will try other vegetables. if any of these do better, i will amend this review but for now, i am very disappointed with this product."
4,Great kitchen tool for spiralizing,"Most of the reviews here make good points about this great little tool...it works well for ""spiralizing"" veggies for raw food cuisine. I haven't had any problems learning to use it. 4 rather than 5 stars because of the small slice and core that remains at the end of spiralizing. Someone else pointed out that the cores can be added back to the veggies in your recipe. Works fine for me."
1,Guess I'm stuck with it now,I have been trying to 20 minutes to spiral some zucchini. It has gone all over my kitchen except in the bowl. Missed my window to return to Amazon. Ebay here it comes. I should have purchased the vertical type. They make the videos of usage look so simple.
1,Returned,The handle on this item broke with the first use. The design is good but the quality if very poor.
3,Works For Now,I've used it once and it already started to break. I used it for potatoes and the plate I used cracked around the metal. I wonder how many times I'll be able to use it before it breaks completely. That's how cheaply made this is. Part of it was already broken but it was just a part of the plastic that holds the plates you aren't using in place so I shrugged and dealt with it. It made a mess but I guess that's to be expected. It will work but I really don't know for how long.
1,Run!,"I was so excited to get this until I actually tried it. I used it on one sweet potato and after turning about half way through the potato, I heard a crack from the handle. I sent it back. The design is good, they just need to improve the quality of the materials. I ordered a Japanese one in hopes that the construction will be much better."
2,I wanted to like it,"I really did want to like it. After being on my wish list for quite a while, my daughter got it for me for Christmas. It does fine with zucchini, but did not do well at all with beets or carrots. WAY TOO THICK. The zucchini looked just like spaghetti, but the beets and carrots were really too thick to enjoy as ""pasta"". Some of it wouldn't cut all the way through so I had really thick slices. I ended up juicing the result so as not to waste it. In my experience, hard veges don't work well with this machine. I had to send it back. Oh well...I really really did want to like it."
3,fun to use,"The spiral cutter is fun to use and I have made spaghetti out of yellow and zucchini squash a couple of times. I do wish it was made out of sturdier material. The plastic doesn't seem like it will hold up for very long. Also the ""points"" that help to hold the vegetable in place are plastic and if you aren't careful you can break them off while ""spiraling"" your vegetables. It is fun and a great way to eat healthier."
2,"Good Idea, Poorly Executed","I bought this because it looks like it should be easier to use and more sturdy than the Saladacco.1. Sturdy? No. The plastic is flimsy, and the crank (all plastic) is less solid than the Saladacco crank which at least has a metal arm.2. Easy to use? No. I could spiralize carrots in the Saladacco but not in this thing.3. Overly large and bulky? Yes. Twice the size of the Saladacco.4. Can you get ribbon thin spaghetti-like spirals? No, I couldn't. Using the smallest blade the spirals came out in quarter inch chunks.5. What's it good for then? It seems to do a good job of purposefully wasting a large portion of the fruit or vegetable you're trying to slice by pushing it through a hole that cuts a half inch core out of the fruit or vegetable.6. What are you going to do now? Send it back and resign myself to using the Saladacco, which is not a perfect solution, but until someone somewhere designs something better it seems to be the only option."
5,Works Great,"I love pasta but needed to cut way down on my calorie intake. Now make huge bowls of zucchini noodles for all kinds of pastas in just a few minutes. So far we have had excellent Alfredo, spicy Thai, pesto etc. delicious low cal meals. Also I save the centers and cook em up later or chop them and add them to the pasta. Also it cleans easy and is pretty fun to use."
4,spiralizer,Easy to use. Makes an excellent alternative to pasta. Several different size blades. Clean up involves a fair number of parts but they cleaned well in my dishwasher.
1,not cool,I did two separate orders and they both reached at the same time but i got one box with four plugs and one single plug which totals to five spark plug. This means my order was not properly filled as i am missing three plugs. this is disappointing as i cant do anything with one single plug

2,Strengths and Weaknesses,"The worksheets are helpful in applying what Malphurs has just covered. The book is loaded with practical hints and tips. The biggest drawback is that Malphurs relies too heavily on statistics that are questionable and cites some that contradict each other. By that I mean that he cites a statistic about 'Protestant' churches which includes Mormons and Jehovah's Witness. Instead I would recommend Stuart Murray's ""Church Planting: Laying Foundations""."
2,Theology lite,"As a PhD Student in Practical Theology, let me say, if you're looking for a theologically thoughtful book on church planting, you'll be much better off reading Stuart Murray's Church Planting: Laying Foundations. Planting Growing Churches breezes over this theological work and simply (and repetitively) asserts that church planting is biblical and that it is the best way to do evangelism, which is also biblical. Murray, on the other hand, situates church planting in its proper missiological and ecclesiological context, grappling with critical concepts such as missio Dei, incarnation and the Kingdom of God. Find my full review of the theology underlying each here: [...]"
3,"Nice how too ... but,","This is a good book for those who have no real idea about how to plant a church. It gives quite a few ""to do"" and ""how to"" lists, which is fine. Overall, however, I feel the author leaves the move of God out of the picture. You can dot all the ""i's"" and cross all the ""t's"", but if God's not in it, success isn't going to happen."
3,Planting Growing Churches for the 21st Century,"This book is written with an obvious new evangelical slant to it. IT is teaching the reader be ""seeker friendly"" while we are taught in the Bible to be ""sinner seekers."" If you like your mind being polluted with such nonsense as postmodernism and post-Christianity this book is perfect for you. The book does have good ideas, but it is tainted with liberal views. It snuggest on a couple instances of using a pub for a meeting place. It also takes a cheap shot at denominations in chapter 10. It stresses programs to build a church and very rarely mentions evangelism (which is how churches are to be started). I really enjoy the fact that the author gives help ideas for picking a location. He gives the pros and cons about each type of location. He also states the importance of having a support group with you. He refers to it as the ""core group."" He gives a detailed list of how you should go about developing the group."
1,Derogatory Toward Women,"I was shocked at Malphurs treatment of women in this book. He places only the male in the leadership role and their wives as mere supporters. Malphurs asks whether wives should pursue a professional career if their husband is a pastor. His response reads, ""If there are no children, there is no problem with this as long as she is able to love her husband, maintain the household, and encourage and support him in his ministry."" He goes on to say that once the couple begins a family ""the wife should be at home rearing the children.""What if the wife has her own dreams and goals in life? What if she is the leader in the church plant team and not the husband? I am sorry that I wasted my money supporting an author who still holds outdated and derogatory views of women. Christianity suffers in the eyes of those who are not religious because of discriminatory comments such as those found in this book."
4,GREAT CD,"This cd is timeless it could have been released in every decade. Flaors of punk, rock,alt rock and new wave. Take a chance surprise yourself. You will probably be able to convince soe of your friends that this is a new band. Thank you"
1,Not very helpful,"I am not instrument rated, but I travel alot in my plane so I needed to know about the weather. I thought this book would offer some insight about how to fly the weather, but since reading it, I have flown into IFR conditions more times than I can count, flew into a thunderstorm, and got so much ice on my airplane that I was very scared. This book will not help you avoid any of these situations."
5,So great!,"I thought I'd dislike the book since it was 3 short stories and I love long novels. But I LOVED this book!Jackie & William were my least favorite just because their story was...well, kind of boring. William was sweet though, and it was cool that he was a virgin.Cale & Kane were great! Cale was absolutely hilarious, she cracked me up. Kane wasn't NEARLY as amazing as his brother Mike, unfortunately.Dorie & Cole were my favorites - they were sweet and funny. I love how Cole falls in love with innocent little Dorie! They were both great characters.Definitely wanna read this book again someday."
1,Very Very Very Boring,"Love the ""A Knight in Shining Armor"" by this author. But I will not recommend ""The Invitation"". The three stories in this book bear the same trait - too much repeat of the internal thoughts by the heroines. It gets tedious after a few chapters and makes you think the author an old lady who keeps mumbling the same things. (Since I know she is not, maybe she just had too much coffee.) Also the storylines are so very juvenile... Even though the second story has some comical highlights, the book really isn't worthy of your time."
1,Dire......,"Ask a 5 year old to write a tennis love staory and this is the predictable tripe you'll get. Not bad acting, but the usual bad English cameos and gratuitous shots of Tower Bridge. Avoid and wait for Bridget Jones 2."
1,Very Disappointing,"I really love seeing cute films with Kirsten Dunst, but this one just plain sucked.Two world class tennis players (one up-and-coming, and one slipping ""old-timer"") meet at Wimbeldon. They explore their relationship through the trials and tribulations of competition, encouragement, an overprotective father, a family that is written to be witty (but fails), and lots of sex.The acting wasn't so bad, but the script lacked any real depth, and outside of a few facets (their relationship with their family, and their love for tennis), the characters were very simple and hardly explored. This one was literally a snooze-fest."
3,Romantic recipe - Nothing new,"Wimbledon is a cute romantic comedy, that follows all the rules of the genre. What makes the movie good is the tennis. Even if you dont like the sport, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as you watch the matches."
3,Tennis Anyone,This is a nice romantic movie. It starts out with two competitive tennis players. One who is declining and a rising star played by Kirsten Durst. Who will meet and fall in love. but alas there are obstacles. Will love conquer all? You have to buy it to find out. But it's worth it.
1,Scary sign of the times,"The only reason I gave this movie one star is because there isn't a lower rating. THis is a terrible movie, and a somewhat scary portrait of modern thinking. This movie can be summed up simply,""Sex equalls love"". This is one of the shallowest and most superficial films I have ever had the misfortune to spend money on. Don't watch, and for Pete's sake, don't let your children watch it. It'll suck the intelligence right out of them."
2,DULL TENNIS ROMANCE,"Wimbledon is a dull romance centered around the tennis event in Britain. A washed up tennis contender, retiring at the end of the season improves his game and goes onto win after finding true love with Kirsten Dunst. Conversely, her game suffers because of their romance.Bottom line, there wasn't enough going on with the characters to make the viewer care."
1,Horrible and Stupid Movie,"My wife, who usually likes this kind of cra#, even full asleep. Gee, Will the underdog rise over adversity and win the girl? Us your brain and don't rent or buy this piece of garbage."
1,only their love is superior,"It is about a guy who ranked not even world's top 100 in tennis, and because he found ""love"" and ""sex"" with the girl, he became number 1 in the world and won the wimbeldon.yes, only his love and sex is superior. could other tennis players have love in their heart too? yes, you bet. but the movie tells you that no one else's love is as good as theirs. their love is simply superior to everyone else's."
3,A roller coaster ride,"Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany fall in love at the Wimbledon championship. Paul plays better when he is in love but Kirsten's game suffers when she falls in love. They learn from each other and find a way to have it all and they do just that. Paul did a great job in this movie but I have seen Kirsten play better roles. Overall, they are worth watching. The writing was a little lacking for me."
4,The Stars Carry the Film,"This little movie would be a footnote of film history if not for the fine performances of the stars, particularly Bernard Hill, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst. They were excellent and convincing in their every scene, converting an otherwise tepid sports/chick-flick into an interesting romantic outing. Truly amazing, though, was the ending. I had absolutely no idea who would win the men's title in the Wimbledon tournament, or how the tumultuous relationship between Peter and Lizzie would end up -- the ending completely blind-sided me."
3,"Not bad at all, but it's not a comedy!!","This movie is not a comedy. It's a gentle, romantic kind of drama that happens during the famous WImbledon tennis tournament. Yes, there are a few laughs here and there, but this movie should not be classified as a ""romantic comedy"", never!The cast is highly skilled. Both Paul Bettany and Kirsten Durst give solid performances. There is also Sam Neill and even Bernard Hill! (King Theoden of the Lord Of The Rings films).The match escenes required a lot of effort by the special effects team, but they succeeded wonderfully. The plays are convincing. (ex- tennis pro and Wimbledon champion, Australian Pat Cash, was the technical supervisor for the actors)"
4,GREAT MOVIE,"THIS IS MY FIANCES FAVORITE MOVIE , SHE COULDNT FIND IT ANYWHERE, LUCKALY AMAZON HAD PLENTY OF COPYS AND AT AN INCREDABLE BARGAN . DEFINITLY EARNED ME SOME BROWNIE POINTS , THANKS AMAZON"
3,Frauds and Frenzies,"In this short film Stan and Ollie get caught commiting fraud and are sent to prison from which they soon escape. Trying to go straight, they both (naturally) fall in love with the warden's daughter. Fun but not fabulous.[...]."
4,Sweet,"This is a fly southern-rap album but is also very lacking in true skill expression. Every song on the album hits, and hits hard. Most tracks have good production overall but are just tracks... no real points or content.If you can find it, I HIGHLY suggest Dro's Mixtape ""I Still Got That Dro"" with DJ Burn One over this album any day. That was where Dro truly showcased his content and skills."
4,pimp muzik,4.5 really Its snappin dro aint no hoe man. yall gotta look out fo this boi. only problem is he brag lil too much utha than that its killin the game fo real
3,"Its ok.... not great, but ok",This cd is alright... only 5 good songs... other then that... T.I. Is the man...
5,Absolutely Worth The Money,"I've watched ABFAB numerous times on the television and I've also rented the complete collection and had an ""ABFAB NIGHT"" with a few friends. We bought some Boli and Stoli and dressed as our favorite characters. It was a blast. I'm biting the bullet and spending the money to own all seven videos. It will be Absolutely Worth The Money!Marie C. Ruddy-Gutscher"
5,There is no better written show,Jennifer Saunders makes American television writers look like hacks. Once you have seen AbFab you will have a hard time watching anything else that dares to call itself comedy.
5,The most absolutely fabulous British comedy ever!,"Jennifer Saunders is a comic genius. She has created characters so real, you wonder if she doesn't really know these people. Dysfunctional takes on a whole new dimension in Eddie Monsoon's world of drink, drugs, and immorality. The one-line cracks are the best. Even though the subject matter (alcoholism, drug abuse, promiscuity, bad mothering, extreme materialism, lack of concern or care for anyone else in the world) is heavy, it is never treated with a heavy hand. Just remember, Jennifer Saunders (who plays the lead character) is making fun of what she portrays. And listen carefully: the British accent can make you miss some jokes when they go by too quickly. I have every tape in this series memorized, word for word, and I am not a big fan of watching TV or videos. By the way, Bubble is the most underrated character in this series: Jane Horrocks is HILARIOUS! This box set is worth every penny."
5,Screwball Isn't Dead,"These beautifully funny shows rival the old screwball comedies of the 1930's & '40's for roll-on-the-ground laughing madness. In fact, the old and rarely seen adjective ""madcap"" describes the shows perfectly.Edina Monsoon is a self-absorbed slacker who lives high by ripping off her ex-husbands. She and her friend Patsy Stone get into almost as many misadventures as they do bottles of vodka. Saffy, Edina's long-suffering, introverted daughter provides the foil for the madness.Jennifer Saunders has talent coming out of her ears; not only does she perform pratfalls and other physical comedy without the help of a stand-in, but her non-stop delivery would be funny if were just reading the phone book. As it is, the scripts are works of art, much funnier than Seinfeld, funnier than Monty Python even.The only problem with these shows is that you can't eat while watching them, because you can't eat while laughing unceasingly."
2,???,"Am I the only person on the planet who found this show to be painfully unfunny? I'm ordinarily very much into British comedy, but this does very little for me. It's just...not funny. Okay, it has the odd moment of levity, but it's really not enough, and the characters are less than appealing as well, so it doesn't even work very well in that regard. Hmph...I suppose its very lack of humour is the reason it's so popular here in the U.S. The American sense of humour has never been exactly sharp, after all, based on the garbage that passes for situation comedy made over here."
4,"came with belt clip, not neck strap","nice case, hard plastic with interior padding. Plastic screen cover protects my video screen. All accessories plug in well without having to remove it from the case. Extra padding included for 30GB thinner video ipod (which I have), you can remove one layer of padding to fit the 80GB. But it came with a clear plastic belt clip, not a neck strap. But clip works well and removes easily if needed, leaving a clear plastic small knob on the back."
3,what you see is what you get for less than $2.,"for less than $2 you get a sturdy aluminum case for your ipod classic, and that's the most important thing - hardshell protection for your precious music player. i have an old yet still working 30gb ipod video, and it fits this case just the same. i don't like the belt clip though. it's made of clear plastic, which makes the whole thing looks cheap. well, come to think of it - it is cheap! anyways, if you's still looking for a tough legacy case for your legacy ipod, then this is the one."
1,this ipod case suxXx,dont buy this unless u want ur ipod to fall out constantly and the clip to break the first day u get it
5,You've all done very well!,"Are you being served? is the best brit-com ever! I already have all the episodes on tape at home and I would suggest this giftset to everybody! I have never found a show this hilarious, one great joke follows another, the characters are amazing each in their own little way, I just can't imagine someone who wouldn't laugh watching these episodes! My friends all thought I was old-fashioned for loving this show so much, I asked them to watch it a couple of times with me and now they like it! Of course it's very british, and that's what I like about it. Here in Canada it plays everyday on tv, but for those of you who can't watch it, buy this set and you won't regret it!!"
1,Nigh Unreadable,"I play a lot of BloodBowl. I run a local league. I go to tourneys. I play online. Everyone I talked to who had read this book (or any in the series) said it was awful. I wasn t ready to pass judgement. The game is intended to be light-hearted, very tongue in cheek fantasy sports action. Kinda hard to screw that up.So I got a copy of this book for free at a Games Workshop sponsored event (even signed). And I read it. Or at least tried to. It was every bit as awful as I had heard and worse.The writing is amateurish at best. The story horrid. The pacing terrible. Everything about the book is abominable.Now, mind you, gamers hate this book. Gamers are used to the very low standard of mass produced GW fluff books, WotC D&D; campaign setting hacksand a thousand poorly conceived Star Wars/Trek pastiches. To turn them off takes a powerfully bad book.Do not buy this book. Seriously."
3,"Fun, but lacking funny","This was a pretty fun book, with non-stop action and blood bowl hijinks...which is what you are looking for, right? But I was hoping for a little more humor. This is definately not Terry Pratchett."
2,What the heck happened to Tom Dicillo?,"I can't totally pan a film that features a nude scene from Liz Hurley (no matter how brief), but overall, this thing stinks. In no way does it measure up to anything DiCillo's done previous to this. I like all of the actors here, but they're given basically nothing to work with here, short of some really anemic Tarantinoisms. Avoid."
2,Just tries way too hard...,"...to be oh-so-hip, so Tarantino-esque. More of an attempt to project ""attitude"" or ""vibe"" than any real or spontaneous substance. There are a few funny and satirical moments in there, but overall it has the amateurish feel of a made-for-TV movie.Result: sad waste of some prime acting talent, especially Steve Buscemi adn Luis Guzman. Dennis Leary has always been a mediocre actor with a very limited range, and he's in way over his head as the central character here. Elizabeth Hurley is gorgeous to look at but also possesses a very limited acting range, and WHAT nude scene are the other reviewers talking about? I didn't see anything more than the side of her breasts for about 2 seconds! C'mon guys, you can get more revealing pics of her on the Internet for Chrissakes! As much as I like her, it definitely WASN'T worth sitting through this one."
2,One confused movie,"This movie does not know what it wants to be. A comedy? Love story? Crime drama? It has multiple storylines that we expect to somehow come together (and they do), but they are so different, it simply does not work. The beginning is very funny and entertaining, so you expect to be in for 90 minutes of great movie fun, but right there, the sad urban drama line kicks in and ruins the whole thing. In the end, the sad and the funny parts cancel each other out, bringing the whole experience to NEUTRAL. The only positives are charming Liz Hurley and the cuddly New York setting. But even that is not worth paying for in this case."
2,what has happened to Denis over the years?,"With Denis Leary and Steve Buscemi in this movie you would think this would be a non-stop laugh riot right? WRONG!. If you like jay leno/Johnny Carson kinda' jokes, then maybe. I thought this movie was very disorganize, very mild in humor, more of a drama/love story, and had about the same enjoyment as stepping on your kids toys in the middle of the night. Denis, please go back to stand up! (I love his ""no cure for cancer""!!!!!!)"
3,"False advertising, good product","The dvd cover art, the images of the known actors, the name of the film----they all convey some sort of comedic romp. What we have is a failure to communicate....but, you end up with some funny moments thrown in with truly grotesque violence. The story of good cop gone stale, Dennis Leary, and the recurring themes of his wife and child in flashbacks do not mesh well with the current dystopia/humor/despair that Leary finds himself in. Buscemi is hilarious, the plot is amusing, in the end, even if some of the elements of the love affair with Liz seem forced. A sort of a fairy tale-in-the-city with some blood and death in the middle scenes.It is definitely worth seeing for the high points, and I will add it to my collection."
5,Woohoo,"Check out that gorgeous little Melonie Diaz!!! WOW, it's worth buying the film to watch her in her catholic schoolgirl miniskirt, pleated outfit. The film itsekf is artistic, fun, comedic, and slightly gory in a funny way... Well worth purchasing for artsy fartsy people..."
1,There's a good reason why this wasn't released theatrically.,"I recall reading an interview with director Tom Dicillo where he expressed frustration with Lions Gate's handling of this film. The film sat in limbo for quite a while only to be denied a theatrical release in the US.After one actually watches this limp, half-baked mess of a film it's easy to understand why it went straight to video.After high profile bombs like Bedazzled and Serving Sara, it looks like Liz Hurley isn't having any better of a time in the wonderful world of ""too hip to have anything resembling a plot"" Indie films.Hopefully this means we won't be seeing her again any time soon.Eventually Dicillo will stop pouting and get back to making films as enjoyable as Johnny Suede and Living In Oblivion."
2,Will Denis Leary ever figure out he can't act...,"Well the title kind of says it all. Dull,ugly,boring men in a dull,ugly boring movie. Also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world. Stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley with ugly, skinny, beaked nosed Denis Leary.Steve Buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film."
5,Exciting and entertaining adventure for kids and adults.,"Although I originally read the book with the intention of sending a copy to my nephew, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the book. The fact that all the adventures were indeed true and happened to the author made the stories more exciting. The book is made up of many individual stories that made for easy reading and allowed me to read as much or as little as I wanted to at a time. A must read for kids or adults interested in adventure, history, military life, the boy scouts or the mischief one boy in a far away land can get into."
2,too long,"too long and involved - I own 1500+ sci-fi novels and enjoy 75% of them. This was one of the exceptions. The concept is good but there were too many charactors and I found myself frequebtly going back to identify who was talking ??!!??!! The other problem was the overly discriptive torture of women and children throughout the book - evil can be so evil that it becomes mind-numbing and the reader just puts the book down for a while and then has to get ""psyched-up"" for the next round. It became a contest to see if the book would defeat me or if I could complete it - which I just barely did."
4,Makes you think - I loved it!`,The writing was great. I loved the thoughts that were put into it. Best reading for anyone. The twist you put in about universes was the best. Made me think ALOT! Thank you. I loved the whole Powers of Light Trilogy.
2,a poem for the knowledgeable,"I purchased this ebook for my Kindle because it was free. The justification - it costs nothing, so it can't hurt, right? And the title sounded promising. As I started reading, I quickly realized I was in way over my head. First of all, the poem is written in an Old English style, using ancient spelling. And there are many references to Greek mythology - Bacchus, cupids with arrows, Queene Guendolen and Pans pype. I think if I had a wider knowledge of Greek mythology and more experience reading poetry, I could really enjoy reading this poem. One line I really appreciated was:""Reade bookes, hate ignorance, the foe to art,""Obviously, the poem has promise!Posted by Poor Richard's wyfe"
5,Beautiful!,"Got this as a Christmas gift from ""my kids"" heh-heh. Hubby did a great job. This is a beautiful gift and a gorgeous chime. I'm thrilled with it and am going to buy it as a gift for someone else. It really does sound like the beginning of ""Amazing Grace."" Great gift for any Christian porch-sitters on your list!"
4,woodstock amazing grace,has held up very well; not so sure it sounds like amazing grace but it is a beautiful sound. highly recommend
4,Restful sounds,"One morning this spring I went to the backyard, where I have multiple windchimes that I got at various inexpensive places, and listened. I realized I needed some quality sounds to compliment the spring wind. I went to Amazon and was able to put in the type of sound I wanted and get a nice selection to choose from and I got Amazing Grace. Do I hear anything that sounds like Amazing Grace, NO but do I hear quality, not tinkling sounds, YES. The quality if fantastic, even my husband said he will sit back there and listen to the chimes and even help them along sometimes when it is windy. By the way, there doesn't need much wind to sound."
1,Wind Chimes,"The chimes broke just past the warranty period. Very disappointed. Called the company and they sent me the string to redo them. Otherwise, it would have cost me almost as much as buying a new one."
3,Not what I expected,I thought I was buying a large wind chime - the metal chimes are only about 20 inches long - hanging up it might be a 40 inch chime including the strings and wooden piece at the bottom. I almost sent it back.
5,A Well Appreciated Gift,I gave these to a dear friend for her birthday. I live in another state so I haven't seen or heard them but she loved them and said they sounded beautiful. She and her husband could pick out Amazing Grace.
5,IN TUNE!,"My husband and I are professional piano tuner-technicians, so we looked a long time for wind chimes which wouldn't drive us crazy being badly tuned. These chimes are soothing, gentle sounding, and best of all, in tune!No, you probable won't hear the exact, in-order notes of ""Amazing Grace"", but that's because of the vagueries of the wind blowing the chimes against the wooden clapper in the middle. However, the notes of the first 4 measures ARE there. The effect is supposed to be subtle and subliminal, so please don't get all upset when you compare the written hymn with the chime's sound.I purchased my chimes in February of 2009 and installed them when the weather warmed up in May. When the window's open, the deep, sweet music is enjoyed by everyone. My daughter in law's blue-heeler dog sits by the window with his head tilted to the side, listening, and quietly crooning along with the sounds he hears!I'm in the market for another set, maybe even deeper, for the front porch."
5,Yet another great Woodstock wind chime!,I had to get this one for my collection of Woodstock Chimes. The tones are beautiful. This is quite a large wind chime and a great value.
4,Very nice tone,Very nice choice of tones on this wind chime. It was purchased to replace a similar item from Sam's Club which had Asian-sounding tones. This chime has a very pleasant sound consistant with Western music. Not sure about the quality and future durability of the support structure.
4,chimes,Great gift. Very sturdy and well tuned. Has a nice basic look to fit most outdoor porch sites. Would also buy this for myself.
1,MADE IN CHINA,"made in Communist China. See other brands: Shenandoah, Corinthian & more made by QMT. Buy USA Write woodstock & complain as originally produced in US & now made in China."
3,STRING CORDS,IT MAKES A NICE SOUND --BUT THE CORDS ARE JUST STRING AND THEY WILL ROT OUT IN THE WEATHER -- TOO MUCH MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WONT LAST MORE THEN ONE SEASON
1,Giving chimes is an awful gift,"Unless you are sure the recipient actually likes chimes they are not a good idea for giving. I was presented with these chimes and while trying to actually have them hanging out on the deck when the gift giver is expected they make peace and quiet for me at least, impossible. The sound is better than that of breaking glass of many chimes but oh, if I could only get rid of them permanently!!"
5,Woodstock Chime,Wife loves this chime. has a lovely sound and is well made. Only chimes in moderate wind which is a good thing.
3,Some what helpful,"I got this for both myself and my spouse. While I found it somewhat helpful my spouse said the voice was not soothing enough to work on them. My spouse has been under before so it maybe that I had no expectations or past experience to draw from. I found that I did sleep better and while I usually don't have a problem exercising anyway, I would say it helped to listen to it to prepare for the next day's routine."
2,adequate,"I have used the Motivation to Move hypnosis CD for a few weeks now, and am not noticing a change in my behavior. I will admit that I generally fall asleep before it's over, but my understanding is that the message should still get through. I have not been using it at other times of the day (for fear of falling asleep!), so I don't know if it would have a greater effect. At this point I would say it's great if you need to fall asleep, but for me, it doesn't seem to be helping me become more active."
2,Did nothing for me,I purchaed the CD.. listened to it for 21 days as directed and it had no affect. Did nothing for me. I would not recommend this. WASTE OF TIME
2,No motivation,I liked the tape for one good reason. I never slept better. When listening to this tape I slept better than ever. Never motivated me to exercise more though.
5,excellent learning tool,"This is a great book for beginners. The very first day the student is playing a little song. Easy to follow and understand even if you have no prior piano experience. I have tried others and did not like them, but I would definitely choose this method again and recommend it to others. The price is very reasonable and it comes with the CD."
5,Excellent program for 6 year old.,"I'm using this to teach my six year old, and couldn't be more pleased. It moves at a really slow, easy pace which is exactly what she needs. She does not feel overwhelmed and yet finds the exercise challenging. She also gets the songs stuck in her head."
2,"Super thin cards, smaller than normal deck","The cards are ridiculously thin and small. I'm talking barely-thicker-than-notebook-paper kinda thin. Plus the deck is much smaller than most other tarot decks. Unless you're married to the graphics for this deck, buy a different one. Not worth the cash."
5,Beautiful images,Perfect pocket-size tarot deck when you're on the go and someone happens to need a reading!
5,Beautiful!,"I loved this tarot deck. The cards are beautiful, full of colors and details. It became my favorite cards since I've receveid them."
4,Zerner Farber Tarot Deck Review,I Have This Deck And I Like It. I Like That The Cards Are Small And Easy To Handle But The Only Thing I Don't Like About The Deck Is That It Doesn't Keep The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck As A Format. It's Just A Weird Deck. I Can't Say I Would Recommend This Deck But I Will Say That It Is Cute And Handy.
3,Religious anthropology,"Keep in mind that this is essentially a work of anthropology. It shows the human side of the Carthusian monks, but does not really explore the spiritual side in any depth. Those who know about Carthiusians will not learn too much, but it does give a more clear perspective on the ways friction can occur even among men who are living in near solitude. The book shows how the personality of a single person can affect the life of a community as a whole. It also shows the inner conflicts of those who are not sure what their roles are or what they want in their spirituality. At the same time, it gives a feel for who would really benefit from this lifestyle. I am truly glad someone took the effort to do such a study.Those who are creating new intentional communities can probably learn some important lessons from this work.However, spiritual seekers may not get much out of it."
5,A page-turner,"Contrary to what you might think, this is not a religious book, although the setting is a 1084 Catholic monastic order. Nor is it a boring recitation of facts. Actually, it's a page-turner, reading like a novel. It is a cultural history, a coming of age story, a mystery all in one.I was surprised to find myself clarifying my own spiritual beliefs as I read about their quite strange practices and also having a great deal of compassion and sympathy and even admiration for them. This is due to the brilliance of the author, who has us walking in the shoes of these 5 young men. You can feel the dampness of the ancient buildings and irritation of the other monks, and the living conditions. The mystery is... which one of the 5 young men will remain after 5 years to commit his life to the Order."
5,A window into an unknown world,"This contemplative, low-key text shone light into a realm unknown and unknowable to most people, and offered insights into the daily rituals and rhythms within this cloistered context. The men described were well-drawn, human, and treated respectfully, and each vignette offered different perspetives and angles on the experience inside the walls.I have recommended this book to friends interested in learning more about lives of meditation and solitude. I found it raised many points of comparison to the lives of Buddhist monks and nuns."
5,Excellent work on the lives of Carthusian Monks!,"This work takes you inside a Carthusiand Monastery and lets you see some of the daily hours of a Carthusian Monk, It is done from the viewpoint of five young men who have chosen to enter the Carthusian Order and seek the Ladder to Heaven"
2,Subtly problematic in some situations,"My one issue with this book is that it tacitly discourages formal legal complaints or action by emphasizing the need for continued discussion/rapprochement between therapist and client, ""not revenge""; a frequent refrain is on ""healing the relationship"" between therapist and client. For clients struggling with egregious or very hamrful boundary violations, this book would be inappropriately and subtly persuasive that they should keep working with a troubled therapist."
3,Pertinent however....,"A friend recommended this book to me to help increase my feelings of self awareness in a more violent society. While it does contain some useful information, I think that it tends to present the idea that one needs to be overly suspicious to be safe. To me, there is a different between awareness and paranoia. I would not recommend this book."
3,As Funny (and substantial) as a Greasepaint Moustache,"If you like Groucho, you'll probably like this collection of songs (plus a few scratchy-sounding routines lifted from the Marx Brothers movies).The main drawbacks are that it's kind of short and the numbers seem to be collected almost at random. And it's lacking one of Groucho's most famous numbers, ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"".On the other hand, you DO get: ""Hooray For Captain Spaulding"", his theme song (this one's a '50s studio recording); ""Dr. Hackenbush"", a song written for Groucho's ""Day at the Races"" character, but never used in the film; the silly but surprisingly warm ""Omaha, Nebraska"", a parody of home town tributes; and the toe-tapping health food parody, ""Black Strap Molasses"" with guest stars Danny Kaye and Jimmy Durante.This doesn't qualify as the Groucho Anthology or even a complete ""Best Of"", but it will entertain any Groucho fan who can't find these songs elsewhere."
5,excellent,An excellent read. Goes straight into my list of top 5 books. The story of Harald Sigurdarsson (harald Hardrada) and his journey to Byzantium to serve in the Varangian Guard. His return to the kingship of Norway and inopportune defeat by Harald Godwinsson at Stamford Bridge. I hope the author continues in this vein. There are so many stories to be told from the North.
3,Byzantine story,"A number of years ago I picked up John Julius Norwich's book, A Short History of Byzantium, and became enthralled with Byzantine history and culture. There are very few novels that have been written about Byzantium and when I learned about this one, I had to have it. The book is ok, but anyone who writes a book about a place really ought to like it. Virtually every Byzantine character in this book is evil and corrupt. Plus, as someone who has picked up a lot of Byzantine history, he has more than a few details wrong. That part I don't blame him so much for since this book was written over 20 years ago, before the internet, where you can find a lot of this information. But really, there had to be a few good guys in Byzantium!!!"
3,works but did not fit,"the screw threading or the diameter of the male end of the device did not fit exactly on my 98 impreza, it screws in enough threads to function but definitely not seated as the OEM part was seated in the socket. Hose fit fine."
4,Cool Water for Ladies,"It smells Great, and my Lady likes it. What else you need to know about it? ! ! ! !"
1,Diuplicate / FakePerfume provided by vendor at amazon.com,I ordedred this perfume Cool Water By Zino Davidoff For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz.But to my surprize whenever my wife would use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Cool Water Davidoff I ever got from this Vendor. I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perumes from vendors at Amazon.com
3,Listed as new and was a used bottle,"I reported to the vendor that the box was opened the conent wasnt full, nearly 1/3 of the bottle was gone. And hope that they will adjust this problem, or at least answer my email!"
1,Fake perfume!,I just bouthg a perfume by amazon.com and the one the just send is so fake don't even smell like perfume pure alcohol.. I'm so mad! This is gonna be the last time that i go to shooping in amazon! So disaponnted!
2,I didn't like it!!,"the box looked used and I was upset because it was a gift and had no time to buy another, I was very disappointed!!!"
3,"Try ""Ibiza Sol"" instead..","I always thought Cool Water by Davidoff was a really nice, deeply refreshing and aquatic scent. I would have given it 4 stars had I not smelled my absolute favorite perfume last year, Ibiza Sol by Mark. I like Ibiza Sol more (hence why I own 5 bottles LOL) due to the fact that is adds what Cool Water lacks, which is just a little more sweetness. If you like Davidoff but habitually have this feeling that something is ""missing"" like I did, give Ibiza Sol a try! You won't be disappointed!"
4,smells fresh,"I love the smell of this perfume - very fresh and outdoorsy. I always have a bottle of this at hand.It isn't over powering. I would say its more of daytime wear and keeps it casual. I love the blue bottle which reminds me of a ""genie in a bottle"""
3,Weak,"Don't get me wrong: I love this scent by Davidoff, and I am a total fragrance snob. I was absolutely ecstatic when I first sniffed it at a department store counter.However, I am disappointed by its longevity. I know fragrances work differently with everyone's body chemistry, but Cool Water does not last on me. After two hours, it's like I didn't use any perfume.Hopefully it will work better for you. I'm looking for something else."
1,Scent weak and doesn't last long,"Save yourself the trouble. If I hadn't thrown the packaging,I would be returning this one. Still puzzles me how Amazon carried this perfume. Usually bought this for my wife in big department stores. Surprised to find them here for a lower cost. Took the gamble, was excited for my wife upon receiving it but to our dismay, the scent is not good as her previous one and doesn't seem to last that long.I have to admit that I didn't read the 1-star reviews and trusted the overall rating and being sold by Amazon. Well, lesson learned and I hope this review also will make you think twice before buying...or better yet, don't buy at all.You have been warned!"
5,The real deal,"I don't understand all the negative reviews and claims that this product is fake. I was somewhat hesitant to order it because of the reviews here, but I decided to take the chance. Besides, ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- how could that possibly be fake?! It's not. This is the legitimate product, packaged in bubble wrap, new box, unopened, full bottle, with real perfume inside. What a concept! Not only that, but I selected ""Free Super Saver Shipping"" which said it would arrive within two weeks. It was here in TWO DAYS. Thanks Amazon!Others complained that the scent is too weak. I have a tendency to agree, but guess what? That's what ""eau de toilette"" means: it's not as concentrated as perfume. So if you are looking for a strong perfume, find one that actually says ""perfume"" or ""parfum"" on the label! But if you're happy with Cool Water like it is (as I am), then order this and enjoy."
5,Best fragrance,"One of the best fragrances - very pleasant, not too strong or overpowering..perfect for work or casual wear.Everybody will love the smell - last long enough - probably for abt 8 hrs without needing to respray."
4,Fresh and light,"I am 38 so I am a fan of Cool Water, especially the one for men, the womens version, is also very fresh, not very flowery, it is also very light which is a plus and a minus."
1,Poor packaging; looks like old returned product,"Poor packaging, it looked like a returned product. Neither does the fragrance last.Bought this from Amazon thinking it would be better from others; but it turned out to be worst! Amazon won't let me return this product."
5,Great product!,Great product! Really like it.. The best perfume in the market. Highly recommended to everyone..would like to buy again.
3,SOCOM US Navy Seals Fireteam Bravo 2,The game is OK to start with but it gets boring real fast. The graphics are not good either.
3,No variety,"This game takes place entirely in Adjikistan. It's not bad to be there, but I prefer other socom games for PSP and PS2 where I can go to several different countries and change scenery. Adjikistan was OK, no real complaints; I didn't feel like we are a special forces team that travels the globe. Instead I felt like we were more like regular army part of some occupation compaign. It was kind of boring."
1,Socom 2 psp,Well i love the PS2 game but the controls are wierd on this game i just couldnt get into it
1,Wrong Rating,"I am very upset. I ordered this game for my son who is very into army games and is getting a PSP for Christmas. We are very strict about NO rated M games. This says it is rated T. However, when I received it, it is rated M. I am returning it and want a full refund."
5,Good Title,"I like to play the PSP when I am stuck at airports and flying on planes. The SOCOM games really make time fly for me. Maybe not for the hardcore everyday gamer, who logs hours everyday but for the average guy to pass a little time it is great."
4,Husbands Review:,FIrst thing he said is it is a great games but gave it four stars because its not THE best. He says he likes the different maps and multipal tasks but not having to have a 'partner' in the game. (Not someone else you need to play with but a bot you have to protect.) It grades you at the end of each level as well which he likes.
5,Great Buy,I just picked up this game and I love it! The graphics are great and its a solid upgrade over the first one for PSP. The current price tag of $15 alone is reason enough for everyone to get this game.
4,All right,I bought this game to play online but when I got I hurried to play online. I went on infrastructure and it said servers are down. I looked online and saw that sony closed down their servers and I was like this sucks the single player pretty good.
5,Love it,Great selection of all types jewelry. I love the stretch ankelet. So much easier to put on than the typical anklets. I will be shopping this site again.
4,A few surprises,"This is a good album for Astley completists. Not quite as comprehensive as the U.S. or UK greatest hits releases, but this album has a few tracks that were previously unavailable on North American Astley albums - ""I'll Never Set You Free"", ""Just Good Friends"", ""I'll Be Fine"", ""Some Kinda Love"". There is also a good short mix of the somewhat popular ""My Arms Keep Missing You"", whereas the U.S. greatest hits has the 12"" mix. The liner notes are brief but interesting; they err however by stating , ""After four albums and a string of hit singles, Rick walked away from the record biz with no regrets."" They neglect to mention Rick's fifth album, ""Keep It Turned On"" from 2001, and of course there are no tracks from it here. For the price, you can't go wrong on this one, and you'll get some rare tracks."
4,Poker Chip Set,The quality of the chips is outstanding! The playing cards are thin and not too durable but you don't buy this set to get playing cards.Easily the best set of chips I've seen for the money. Definitely a good buy!
5,For the teenage poker game,"Our grandson was the hit of his poker night with this slick outfit.Everything they needed was there, in a Cool case.(he LOVED the case!)"
4,Not a bad set,"I liked this set because it had a lot of $1 and 5$ chips plus the dealer and blind coins. It also came with other coins, cards and dice. This is one heavy set. I do worry that the aluminum case isn't durable enough. I can see the handle breaking if you are not careful. Just handle it tenderly and you should be fine. The felt lining inside the case also isn't designed to handle the weight. Still a good set for the price."
5,Very nice set,Just got these the other day and had our first poker night. This is a very nice chip set for the money. Nice weight with quite a few demonitaitons and extras included in the set. A must have for the poker party host!
4,Good book,The book has good information and is exciting. It shows how we were aware of electricity and electromagnetism thousands of years ago and discusses some our lost technological treasures. However some of the stories seem to blur after as they are the same story just different setting. If you can get beyond that the book is a wealth of knowledge and is very well written.
1,"This is NOT ""The Scabs"" w/ Bob Schnieder","If you are looking for ""The Scabs"" w/ Bob Schnieder, then don't buy this!Those albums are Freebird, More than a Feeling, and Destroyer.The Scabs w/Bob Schnieder don't have ANY Imports!!!"
5,Some of the best music Made in Belgium in the 80 and 90,"Yes import for you but great import. This is without a doubt the best band of the eighties and nineties in Belgium. The songs are timeless and still rock my world. Guy Swinnen, the lead singer still makes very powerful music. His new band is called Swinnen."
3,on drugs,"this guy is way out here, these books of his are informational to a point. he collects his ""data"" from other people. he does not really do anything himself and creates a vivid story . kinda like dan brown does."
2,"Everyone should read it, not everyone will like it.","The book itself contains much that is good. Everyone should be made aware of the warning that is in the book. My problem with the book was the repetiveness. I can understand Mr. Geryls' use of words rather than putting a lot of math into the text. but still I believe that he might have done a better job of speaking to the audience. But then I understand that the general audience that he was trying to reach may have to have things spelled out for them over and over again to get the point. I also do not agree with his placement of Atlantis on the Continent of Antarctia. But I'm more than willing to allow for differences. All in all, I believe that everyone SHOULD read this book."
4,Good research and explanations,"Mr. Geryl did an excellent job with his book. Many years of research went into it. A solar superstorm will happen again, and it could be an extinction level event for mankind. I highly recommend reading this book."
1,World Cataclysm review,This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The guy goes through ridiculous number gyrations that make absolutely no sense to prove points that make no sense. I'm going to toss this book in the garbage.
2,Grammar for Language Arts Teachers,"This book is a little overwhelming at first glance. The authors state that the intended audience is for language arts teachers. I think that it may be more useful for high school teachers. The language in the book is not conducive to early learners or for people who speak English as their second language. As you learn and struggle through the middle chapters, you find yourself starting to understand more of what the book was trying to say in the first chapters. Therefore I think that Chapters 10 and 11 should be the first chapters in this book. I have heard somewhere that a writer should revise first, and then get down and dirty with grammar. Chapter 11 is about revising, which is why I think it should be first and not last.This book was fairly confusing to me; the examples in the chapters were not the best to use for classes. All in all, I would recommend this book for a reference book, but definitely not for a classroom instructional book."

4,Exploration at it's best,"This documentary describes what many marine biologists would term the ""dream expedition."" Lets take the highest tech equipment, a top notch research vessel, a deep sea submersible, a selection of scientists that can discuss anything we might encounter, the world's premier videographers, and a discovery film crew and go spend a month in a place where little exploration has been done. With a formula like that it would be difficult to fail. The Discovery Channel has produced a wonderful product that will appeal to anyone at all interested in scientific exploration. My only complaint would lie between the editing of the TV version (1 hour) and the released video (90+ minutes). I haven't sat and watched each frame by frame but whatever was taken out could have been left out. The release version requires a good bit of endurance as some of the sections get a little to wordy for the casual viewer."
2,Could Definitely Be Better,"The primary problem with this book--at least the copy I'm holding here--is that the production quality is abysmal. This is poorly printed, to the point that many of the illustrations are rendered worthless. Aside from that, if you've got a copy of the Tyrad Company catalogue (it's an occult shop, with a retail catalogue available for a dollar or two), then you've got this book. It's mostly repetition from a catalogue. The book contains a collection of designs culled from various grimoires and other sources--they range from the 6th and 7th Books of Moses seals to Amish hex signs. There are also Egyptian designs, Black Pullet talismans, Ashanti seals, astrological symbols--a general occult hodgepodge. This could actually be somewhat useful, if the designs had been presented larger and darker (many are so light they're difficult to see). Perhaps your copy won't be so rough, but the one I've got is all but useless."
2,This Booklet Could Lead to Other Sources...,"This booklet is not a work of literary art, and not published well. It looks more like a compilation of photo copies and cuting and pasting.The work could serve as a beginning source for information. For example, you might see a talisman in the booklet, and do a further search on the net for information.If you are unable to find information, check with me via email (bw@teleport.com), and perhaps I can direct you to information that I have found in my research. Also, do a seach here on Amazon with the keyword Symbols."
2,Ugh! Who selected these songs!,"This is not a review of Matthew Sweet, who is a phenomenal talent, but rather of whoever chose these selections. Were these randomly pulled out of a hat? If you want a greatest hits collection, check out Time Capsule. It's not perfect, either, but it's a heck of a lot closer than this mish-mash. This gets two stars because it's remastered and, frankly, it is Matthew Sweet so all the tracks are listenable. Not his greatest hits, though."
2,Schizophrenic Hodgepodge!,"This is an schizophrenic hodgepodge of a compilation with a few of Matthew's alternative radio hits, bizzare picks for album tracks and one rare EP track (Superdeformed) tossed in. Whoever culled these tracks together had no idea about Matthew's music, though I give them credit for adding the overlooked ""Thunderstorm"" suite from ""In Reverse"". (It's worth hearing but not in this context).Leave this cheapo CD made for truck stops and convenience stores in the rack and buy ""Time Capsule"" instead which has 7 of the 12 tracks here, excellent liner notes and coherent sequencing."
2,"Superdeformed, for sure","You can't possibly create a listenable MS anthology out of 12 songs. This looks like one of those cheapo budget compilation CDs, but it's not priced that well, either.Matthew Sweet deserves better than this."
5,FUN,"This toy was a lot of fun to play with, it took time for me to find out to spin it but when I did I couldn't put it down. My 8 year old friend liked playing with it, but she diddn't even know it could spin! She still dosen't know, but she hasn't played with my barbies in a while so I don't know if she likes it or not."
2,not a spinning success,"My four year old daughter wanted this doll, so I got it for her and paid regular price. Even the discount price I think is too much. The Barbie is really hard to get to spin, even I have problems with it. You have to hold on to this little handle and pull a string to get her to spin and the legs and arms need to be in a certain position. The regular Barbies now where the outfit and skates because my daughter likes them better, even with out the spinning feature."
1,Great transaction; Disappointing product,"Five star transaction went smooth as silk and DVD was quickly received. Unfortunately, after watching the DVD, we were extremely disappointed with its lack of content. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone! More or less, the video basically has someone narrate through the menu ""this product has a lot of features but we won't show you how to use any of them"". There was zero technical how-to content. For geocaching, there was one quick sentence mentioning it was possible. Save your $$$."
1,Bennett eTrex DVD not worth the price.,"There is almost no ""How To"" on this DVD. This is pretty much a light pass over the Menu Functions which I had already done. Not much more usefull than the eTrex manual, which is also pretty sketchy & confusing. Definitly not worth the money."
2,Maintenance book most for engines,"This book deals more with early Prado J9 than recent J12 version.The first half of the book is devoted to review and show disassembly sequences for many engines, however the level is not very deep.The car body description is also not very good.I have direct experience with repair manuals from other editors,e.g. Delius Klassing & Co (German)and Revue Technique Automobile (French)thus I expected a similar quality also in the pictures.But this is not the case.Anyway this is the only manual for Toyota J12 I found in the open literature."
2,repair manual,usefull for general info but for specific information book is lacking details. diagrams noted are not complete
5,Just like the title says - Perfect!,"The Robotech/Macross series is one of most loved animes of all time. I was already hooked on anime from watching various early TV shows, like Starblazers, Battle of the Planets, Tranzor-Z, Voltron and Thunderbirds 2086. I had to chance to watch one of these tapes that I borrowed from a friend of mine. It gives you a chance to see the ""americanized"" verison of Macross and the orginial version of that episode. The american version of course is in english and the orginial version is japanese with english subtitles. If haven't started your Macross collection yet or just adding to it, get these tapes! They are just too good to past up."
3,not what I hoped for,"The rug is nice looking, but the texture was not what i hoped for. The weave isn't very tight and the yarn is soft, making it a bit slippery. I had an older rug from India that had a very different texture, and that's what I was expecting. Barefoot yoga was exceptional in handling the situation. I had received an email from them asking if I was satisfied and I told them what i wrote above. They found out what other rugs they had that might work better for me and offered to ship the new one free of charge. I got the rajasthan rug with OM and it's great. Much better texture with a very tight weave. This is the rug I would recommend for asthanga practice."
2,Non-memorable summer - type read.,"Hmmmm---most wanted here is a belivable story line! First the premise is a bit wild--- 14yr.old girl falls in love with jailed adult male and MARRIES him!!If that isn't quite wild enough, the young girl just happens to meet a caring, loving, supportive, adult professional to take her under her wing. (Sounds a bit like a fairy-godmother).One thing I did enjoy --- it brought back many memories of high school--was the poem 'The Highway Man'. I recall studying it in school and always liked it."
4,Wow!,What a great story! I finished this book several days ago and can't seem to get the characters out of my mind. Arley and Annie seemed so real. I am somewhere in between the 2 of them and could relate to both of them wholeheartedly. I can't wait until the next novel by this amazing writer! I agree with another reviewer...a sequel PLEASE!
2,"Predictable, this is the stuff of soap operas!","Mitchard's new book, The Most Wanted, was a serious disappointment to me. I loved The Deep End of the Ocean and found it almost painful to read, its character depth and poignancy, was wonderful. The Most Wanted takes a facile look at relationships and the characterization lacks depth. Annie Singer is the most interesting of the bunch, but Arley's point of view becomes tiring reading. I was disappointed!"
4,Romance To Danger,"A story of a well matured 14 yr old girl (arley) that could easly pass for 18+ .Against her parents and friends wishs Arley falls for a convict (Dillion), where poems and letters are exchanged .Together they have a child and when Dillion is out of prison he will stop at nothing to get his child . Even though Arley has struck up a close friendship with the DA there is nothing her nor Arley can do to stop Dillion who is very determined to get his child .A story we can all relate to in this day and time as most 14 yr olds try to grow up to fast , and never listen to their parents . To me this wwas a book that pulled at the heartstrings ."
3,Not bad,"I liked this book. I didn't LOVE it, but I liked it. The relationship between Arlington and her mother was interesting. I would read it just for that aspect of it. I've never known of a woman to just completely not care about her daughter and be so self-centered the way Arlington's mother is."
2,terribly disappointing after Deep End of the Ocean,"I felt cheated by the ending. This was an amateurish effort not worthy of the author who wrote Deep End of the Ocean. Her prose is, as always, wonderful, but the plot was ridiculous and the ending just unbelievable."
2,difficult to get involved with...didn't grab my attention,"I enjoyed Mitchards other book, Deep End of the Ocean, but found that also slow in getting my attention. I am half-way through this book and just about to throw in the towel on it. I find I don't particularly care about either character. I am thinking of just putting it away for awhile."
2,"Too sentimental, although it is suspensful in the end","I didn't care a whole lot for this book. Mitchard is good at some things, like getting inside the mind of her middle-aged lawyer heroine, but there are too many cliches in the book, and it is too sentimental. Since some of the story is told through the eyes of a 14-year-old girl, the narrative is marred by too much melodrama and mushiness."
5,A really good novel!,"I really enjoyed More Than Wanted, it's only problem was that it started out kind of slow.It wouldn't have worked out right though if it had gone right into the plot.It did start out good though & continue that way. I liked the storyline a lot & this book was sentimental & poetic. It was a nice love story that showed what power love has over people. It is written in chapters seperately narrated by the 2 main characters. This was nice because you saw what was going on seperately in their life & their different takes on the situation. More Than Wanted had all the elements of a good novel: a little romance(not trashy), drama & a little insight into the characters interesting lives. It deserved 5 stars because I thought it was great & had trouble putting it down. You should go read it!!!"
1,Don't buy this book!!,"The writing was disjointed and confusing in the beginning. I particularly disliked Annie and her chapters of supposed character development. Arley was not believable. If Arley was allegedly a smart girl, why would she marry an older man in prison. Her dialogue made her sound like a Texas ""valley girl."" Like totally, dude. It was nonsensical. It was also completely predictable and distasteful!! I say so what and who cares about these characters."
2,"Contrived, but readable","I was pulled into ""The Most Wanted,"" but found myself becoming more disillusioned with it as I progressed. The two main characters are interesting, likable, and well-drawn, but from the start (even in the prologue), the foreshadowing is gimmicky. I kept waiting to read about the cabin and the fire, and it was quite different and in some ways ""less dangerous"" than I expected. Further, the relationships between Stuart and Annie and Annie and Charley get resolved too easily. In the end, everyone ends up happily living in the wonderfully renovated house, each getting what he or she wants, with only a few nightmares to disturb the peace."
3,"good book, not great","I enjoyed this book, yet couldn't quite read it with the passion that I did her previous book. I found the character Stuart annoying and his cliches like ""Don't ever change Babe"" put me off tremendously. The ending was very contrived. I loved the relationship between Annie and Arley, it seemed true and sweet. It broke my heart everytime the character of Rita was brought in. So many things about this book were great, so many were not. I hate to keep comparing to Mitchard's previous novel, but I loved it so much that this was a bit of a let-down. Charley was such a wonderful character, he had color and wit and kept me interested all the way through. I wish I could say the same for all the characters. So I'm torn, I liked it, but certainly did not devour it with the fervor and passion of some of my other summer reading."
2,"After Deep End of the Ocean, this was a huge disappointment","I was so excited to read Mitchard's latest book, since her previous book was totally mesmorizing. Though I was discouraged by the plot (good girl-bad boy), I bought it anyway. Boy, did I regret it. The characters were totally unsympathetic, the plot was contrived, and the writing was simplistic. In particular, the poetry seemed to be maudlin -- certainly, it did not convince me of any character's complexity/sensitivity. Stick with the first book and save your money."
2,"slow disappointing read,","I could only finish this book because of my curiosity to the ending of the sad, dismal ""love"" story about Arley and Dillon. There were some obvious errors in editing, I hope the person responsible wasn't overpaid for the job. I did like the typical progression when you could tell Arley was just a typical teenager, quickly getting over her great love. This book was very difficult for me to get through. The ending was much better than the lst half."
5,"A complicated, engrossing book...","I couldn't put this book down. I come from a similar situation and could understand how lacking in love and warmth in your childhood can make you desperate for love and attention. The author showed, through Arley, that a person with a bad childhood can make the choice to be a good and loving parent.A must read."
2,Disappointed after Deep End of the Ocean,"I bought this book because I loved The Deep End of the Ocean, but I have to say I wish I hadn't. It was REALLY hard to get into. I did not like the Annie chapters at all. I found myself skimming these chapters. About half way through the book I finally got into it, and I liked the ending. However, I hope they don't make a motion picture out of this one."
2,Author is Jacquelyn Mitchard???,This cannot be the Jacquelyn Mitchard who gave us The Deep End of the Ocean. I am so disappointed in this silly book.
2,What is all the fuss about?,Why does everyone think she is such a great writer? Mitchard can go on for 3 pages about something that could be told in half a page. I especially didn't like the way the chapters were written - first by Annie and then by Arley. I'm all for character development but this is ridiculous!
1,Don't waste your time on this one!,"I don't really know why I even bought this book in the first place. I saw it in the store and for some reason after reading the back, thought it might be good. Well, normally it takes me a few days to a week to read a book. I started this one about a month and a half ago and just finished it today. Why I didn't stop reading it before I wasted my time reading the whole thing, I'll never know. PLEASE don't be fooled like I was! This book was really bad!"
5,functional beauty,"While I understand the previous reviewer's comment about the difficulty of getting the last of the butter from the crock, that is little to complain about in something that is both pretty and useful. Those of us who dislike trying to spread hard butter on a piece of toast will find this a great device. The butter stays fresh and soft and you can drive your guests crazy by asking them to guess what the dish is for."
4,recording dates,"FYI the recording dates for this issue are:Don Juan (4 December 1951), Death and Transfiguration (3 July 1953), Till Eulespeigel (4 December 1951) and Venusberg Music (7 October 1954). So regardless of how good the sound is, it is still MONO, not stereo for all the items. Just be aware. you wont be disappointed in the performances themselves."
5,The Industry Standard,"I began scratching two years ago using this book, and progressed faster through the basics than any of my friends who started at about the same time. Now I use this book to teach others. It breaks things down into easy to follow and clear descriptions, something that no video I own bothers to do.The interviews are also dope; QBert, Swamp, Mixmaster Mike, Craze, Atrac, and Kuttin Kandi all have interesting stories to tell.There is also a short history of the hip-hop DJ, which is stuff everyone should know if you're going to DJ.The two pieces of vinyl that come with the book have some great samples for scratching and two cuts for beatmatching.I especially enjoy teaching with this book, it makes it easy for my students to make progress between lessons. It also includes some traditional music notation, which gives me a clear vocabulary to talk to my students with.If you're starting out this book is excellent.It works!"
1,Don't buy this!,"I found this book totally useless. It's thin, pretty much only talks about scratching, and the little information it contains anyone who is even thinking of learning how to DJ already knows.There is nothing in here to help someone become a DJ. It's pretty much all focussed on scratching and even then misses the mark.If you want to scratch *maybe* this book as something for you (I doubt it). If you want to be any other kind of DJ, don't even think this book will help.The things that this should but does not include:- A detailed section on beat matching. I think the book spends a whole paragraph on it.- How to use a mixer. There is absolutely *nothing* in this book about equalizing.- The various ways of mixing one song into another.I could go on and on ...Stay away from this book. It look like it was written for pre-schoolers and even the way the author writes mkes it seems like he's tryig to teach six year old kids ...What a waste ..."
2,Zzzzzzzzz.....,"I read this book two months ago and I just woke up now.Yeah, yeah, I know: 0 out of X people found this review helpful."
5,Order arrived as described,"I had a problem with this order, due to the post office not delivering it to me for almost 2 months. The shipping tag on the item shows that this seller shipped it quickly, but the post office didn't deliver it in a timely manner. I would have received this book within the seller designated timeframe, if the post office had delivered it on time. The book is in good condition and it arrived as described."
5,Book Review,Once again Amazon was a reliable vendor. My used book is in great condition. It also arrived very quickly which was important.
5,As expected.,Was pleased to find the product arrived exactly how it was described and in a very timely manner.
3,Comprehensive overview of organizational mindsets and how they affect change,"Without a doubt, this book is the authoritative source for applications of psychological motivations and group behavior analyses to how an organization views and reacts to change attempts. It also analyzes different change initiative styles and presents guidelines on how to see them through the eyes of each of the different frames.The low rating on this book is because it's more useful as a reference than an immediate how-to guide or problem-diagnosis. To apply it, read cover to cover, perform an in-depth observation of your organization and your own skills, and then come up with a plan. So, like I said, it's comprehensive, but neither reads smoothly nor is it immediately applicable for most people."
5,Making Sense of Organizations,"This is an outstanding book for people who want to figure out what is really going on in the organizations in which they work. If you cannot make sense of things at work these days, read this book. It is an excellent book on organizational reality.This book should also be required reading for all ""managers."" If you are trying to ""run an organization,"" do yourself, and the people who work for you, a favor. Read this book!Finally, college and university professors should consider this book for their organizational behavior courses."
3,Good reframing,"This book is still very timely, but I also highly recommend ""Growing Great Employees"" by Erika Andersen as an addition to this book.Growing Great Employees: Turning Ordinary People into Extraordinary Performers"
3,"This is ok, but others are better","Overall, this is ok, but it seems more of the later era of Lawrence Welk than an overall mix of the older and newer. A little more Myron Floren would have been appreciated."
3,Just NCRS type data,"When a book is labeled a ""buying guide"" I expect it to give tips on what to look for -- rust in the birdcage, uneven headlights from poor vacuum, etc. I thought this was going to help me be a better buyer -- and maybe guide you to certain features on different years that are to be particularly pursued. Nope. What the book does do is identify various parts of the car, year by year. If you are a stickler for a 100% original car then this book will help. There is absolutely no other buying help -- but it would help you identify the wrong radiator cap for that year, etc."
1,Barely Ok for a filling ...NOT Good for Cap cement,"This stuff will work for a temporary filling as long as it is not on the sides of the tooth. Tried this product to hold a crown on... sorry it held for the hours I was sleep after I bit down on a napkin for 1 hour. Next morning crown popped back off. This stuff to thick to be used inside small crowns, I had better luck using Super glue! GEL. The company making this is getting a fortune.. 5.00 for 2 grams? The actual Dental cement cost 14.00 for 20 oz.. NEVER AGAIN..."
1,Totally Useless - Try Something Else,"I tried this product on a simple loose cap despite many poor reviews. I should have paid attention. This stuff is useless. I am an engineer with over 40 years of experience, including the use of adhesives. I followed the preparation and application directions flawlessly. I even kept pressure on for an hour (very uncomfortable). The crown fell off immediately after. Save yourself some grief and a little money and use something else."
1,Useless,The stuff crumbles and falls out within a very short time. You might have better luck using softened paraffin. What a colossal waste of money.
1,"Is this Cap, or Crap?","It is useless for a long lasting cap. If you are immediately going to go to the dentist, then this item will work I suppose. However, if you are looking for something to put in your ""survival"" pack to aide you in emergency dental, then good luck. Sorry, but other products are much better than this one."
1,dental glue,Didn't work for me. It wasn't sticky enough to hold my toothe in place. It may work for someone who is gluing a filling into the toothe..
2,Ugh...got an extra 20?,"I had a lot of trouble applying this product, I thought I was doing something wrong. I still needed to use it after I ran out, and for an extra 20 at the pharmacy I bought Dentek Temparin Max instead, and that stuff works great- it's stickier, holds longer and bonds to the tooth MUCH better. Do yourself a favor and get yourself that stuff instead."
1,Total Crap,"I actually bought this product at walgreens because I was desperate after my bridge came out and I couldn't get the dentist's office to call back. It tastes ok, but it was almost too dry to even scoop out of the bottle. Once I get it in the bridge it was not at all pliable. I couldn't even get the bridge to fit again with this inside. It was also quite painful on my sensitive teeth where the bridge was fitted. I would say you are better off using nothing at all than trying this crap!"
1,Don't Buy,"This product does not work. Don't waste your money. I've tried it twice and it crumbles out within a few hours. It is outrageously expensive, too, for the tiny amount you receive. Please don't bother."
5,Excellent product.,I bought this months ago to fix two gold crowns that came off my teeth. This was supposed to have been a temporary fix but the product excelled itself. I eat anything I want as I did when the crowns had been put in by the dentist.
3,"Great routines, but not the best package","These routines never get dated (even though Newhart bombed with the ""King Kong"" routine as his SNL monologue; it wasn't the right venue, and many had already heard it). These are some of his classics. However, why would you pay almost $20 for an import when he has an anthology of ALL his routines going for under $15? Go for ""Something Like This..."" instead!"
