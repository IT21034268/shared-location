4,If people say the old ones were better they had to be good,"God this is some great album, and i just bought it really cheap, never heard them before i have to say i was not decieved a single bit. The song Come Clarity is a great achievement and I hope it will lead the way for further great metal ballads. All the songs are great and the solos kick butt. The only decieving point i thought was the excess screaming, the guy can sing really well but he hardly ever shows his talent. But overall if you can get this album, it is equally as good as As I Lay Dying's Shadows are Security or Trivium's Ascendancy. A Great cd to own, don't pass it if you see it."
5,The Beatles of hard rock?,"Every album different, every album good. I have found that friends who listen to pretty much any genre of music like In Flames, even girls who mostly listen to things like Fall Out Boy like at least a few songs by our favorite Swedish metal band (My Sweet Shadow from STYE always wins them over), similar to how everyone can find at least one song they like by the Beatles. Having already conquered Europe and now taking on America, the similarities are unbearable. Best hard rock band ever? Perhaps--not only because of their skill, but because of their ability to change and create new art."
3,It is what it is...,"This product does exactly what it claims. The only thing the JAM MAN doesn't do what I wish it would is use quantizing to make it easier for tracks to ""fit"" in their loop. I know the boss looper does this and comparing videos online you too would understand how nifty the quantizing feature is. I am looking to sell this item on ebay because I can just run my line-out from my pedal I play with for practic into my PC and create loops from there much more detailed and not have to worry about not being able to quantize my loop."
5,excellent,It's a great product and a great thing to have as a guitarist. It does everything it is advertised to do and was ready to use straight out of the box.
5,Wow,"With a mixed up gal like me, this got me straight. It has room to write, and also it has written reminders for importent dates"
1,worst product i have ever purchased,"I purchased one of these during the winter but just tried it out, the batteries last for less than one half pint of liquid, really weak pump and electrical system. I wouldnt purchase another one if they were free with free shipping."
2,Bad Experience.,"This product was the right size for what I wanted to do. However, the pump quit after one day of operation."
4,From a student's point of view,"I was required to read this book for a university course. I found the CALLA method very interesting and I believe it would help in the classroom, but the book is very repetitive. I was bored to tears much of the time as I read through it cover to cover, which I was required to do. There is a basic theme (using content area materials in ESL classes) which is covered in the first few chapters, then the rest of the book is variations on the primary theme. An exciting novel it is not, but as a book you use for reference rather than reading cover to cover, I recommend it."
5,This book is great.,This is my textbook for Teaching strategies. I really get into it while I am reading it. It is great for all teachers expecially new teachers.
4,Durable and Convenient,Great sink mat. I like the fact that it has a flap in the middle that keeps things from going down the garbage disposal or drain. It is really easy to keep clean. I was looking everywhere for a black mat to match my kitchen and it is perfect. Doesn't bend or curl up at the edges either like some of the other brands.
1,"strong, fumy smell",The chemical odor was so bad that my husband and I couldn't stand it. We let them air out downstairs for a couple of weeks thinking the smell would dissipate but it was still just as bad. Got rid of them... waste of money! I miss the old style of Rubbermaid mats that came in different colors - and they didn't smell!
1,Smells Funky,"Would not buy this item again. Been using for a couple weeks and still has a bad odor. Also, gets slimmy with regular use."
5,Super Item,My kitchen is stainless and black. These mats look great in my stainless steel sink and protect the sink from scratches. I bought two; one for each side of a double sink.
1,"Rubbermaid Antimicrobial Small Sink Mat, Black","Rubbermaid Antimicrobial Small Sink Mat, Black .Terrible off center the whole for the drain or flap should I say is 3-4 inchs off. very disappointed,"
1,bad mat,We have use this mat from rubber maid & it is a very bad looking mat. I do not beleive that this was made here in the states!!
2,Dude.,This mat is way too small. It barely helps at all. It also doesn't always make it easy to drain water in the sink. Not happy with it.
1,smelly,"The rubbermaid sink mat smelled so badly that I ended up throwing it out. I waited two weeks for the smell to subside, but every time I entered the kitchen it smelled like a skunk."
2,Greatest Hits Mary Wells,"I was somewhat disappointed with this product since it did not really have what I had expected. Mary Wells performace was part of an oldies show done in Florida. The DVD box provided little information as to the date of this performace or really anything else about it. It was a pleasure to hear Mary sing her Motown Hits, however, everything about this production spells cheap. Mary deserved much better treatment."
2,"Quantity, Not Quality","The Honor Harrington books have been renowned for their action. This volume is nothing but talk, talk, talk. It's conclusion is disappointing, for it leaves key elements hanging. In 861 pages Weber could have wrapped up the story line more conclusively. I predict that future Harrington novels will be ""co-authored"", so that Weber can make money without the effort of actually writing the books."
2,When the Rest of the Story Appears in the Next Couple Books,".. . . the total rating earned might add up to 5 or 6 stars.I complained about the endless fighting in Weber's last two books; now it's endless obsessing about diplomacy and politics among mostly 2-dimensional characters. Incomplete bits of story tossed in. Honor mostly on the sidelines. Shameless watering down of one story to justify (I'm guessing now) two more books. And the shameless watering down evidently did not save him any work, because he still came up with 800 pages. Man, what a job to finish reading. It's like he wants to stretch the story out because he's afraid he won't have another story left in him for the next book. Which I sincerely doubt would happen. He needs to get back to telling taut, exciting, fast paced, action and character driven tales!"
2,Would have been an OK 300 page book,"unfortunately it was 800+I've read all Webbers books (not just the Harrington series) and I think he's a wonderful author, but somebody needed to edit this effort drastically.There are some interesting developments in the first 100 pages and the last 100 sets up the next book(s) but the rest is way too long winded. This reminded me of some of Tom Clancy's weaker efforts, a small idea padded out to long book.It seems Webber may be setting up the rumored ""Manticore becomes the expansionist bad guys but Honor is still duty bound to ..."" I really hope this is not the direction that he takes because it certainly isn't what I'm looking for out of this universe.Very disapointing, and I don't think I'll be buying the next one in hardcover."
2,Not his best,"I have been a fan of David weber for a long time now. This book is set in the honorverse but little of the book (less than 1/4 I would say had Honor in it. About half the book dealt with the Manticore government and the petty ( and frankly dull) stuff going on there. I only hope that this book is setting the ground for another book or two. It has the feeling of something that was writen to meet a contract rather than tell a story. The parts with Honor were good, but they were too far and few."
3,too much going on,"While I throughly enjoy the Honorverse, this book suffers greatly from being overly busy. Weber has too many seperate plot threads going at the same time, and each of them suffers from lack of attention. Elemination fo some of the secondary plots and expanding the main plots more fully would have made the book a lot more readable. Also, his last several books have suffered an ongoing encroachment of politics, to the detriment of the space opera portion of his stories. Perhaps he should revisit the earlier Honor Harrington books and attempt to recapture that missing spark."
2,Such a waste of time,"Imagine 'Star Wars' being eight hours long, and beginning with a five hour Senate meeting that shows everything. EVERYTHING--the delegates shaving, driving to the building, parking, sitting down, getting their pens out, everything. Around the fifth hour a delegate from the Emperor drops by to announce the Senate is dissolved and, oh, by the way, something unpleasant seems to have happened to Alderaan off-camera.That's what reading this book is like.I'm on page 714 and it looks like some action is about to start. PAGE 714.What's especially frustrating is that Weber's utterly forgotten about the ""Hell's Gate"" series in favor of writing something like this."
2,What a disappointment!,"I was truly disappointed in War of Honor. It doesn't compare at all with the first 8 books in the Honor Harrington series. However, it does compare quite nicely to its predecessor Ashes of Victory, they both stink. As far as I'm concerned you can completely skip the first three fourths of the book. The last fourth of the book isn't much, but at least we saw a little of the Honor we know from earlier books. I'm so glad I didn't waste even more money by buying the hardcover version.Will I buy the next book, of course I will. But please Mr. Weber, write it like the first 8 books, and not like a boring political novel."
2,too much talk not enough action,"Very different from previous books which I greatly enjoyed - where the politics were definitely supportive to the action - in this book, there is all too little action, and what little there is seems incidental to the politics."
2,Soap opera,"Unfortunately David Weber, like so many authors today seems to be writng for a TV mini series not a novel. The cast of characters is so large that it is hard to keep track of who did what and when. The scene changes so many that the modern TV producers will love it. Honor Harrington, the heroine is conspicious by her absence. Like his last two novels about her, 80% of the book is about other people. Also, it should have been called the ""Battle of Honor"" as it is a lead-in to the sequel(s) that will have the war.I also didn't like his non-standard use of female pronouns to refer to people in general, it interrupted the flow and made me stop reading to try and figure out who he was talking about. Besides using bad grammer the book was poorly edited in general. I don't think I will be buying any more of this line."
5,Liked it,I was between a 4 and 5 star but went with 5 because I didn't agree with the 2 & 3 reviews. I thought it should have been shorter and if you want mostly space war. I enjoyed the focus on diplomacy and politics which in the real world are a major part of war. People seem to forget HH is now an Admiral and their function in war is different then a ship commander. One of my favorite real world Commanders Raymond Spruance was much like HH in this novel. I like this series because it provides a believable fantasy world without BEM's or beating the readers over the head with their personal philosophy. But then I find Politics as exciting as war.
5,Never enough of Honor,There is never enough of Honor and her adventures! Each book gives us a little more of the story however the Honorverse is so rich and detailed that the series could go on for many more books. Of course there are side stories not covered that is what makes this series so rich and satisfying. I have read each book many times and each new reading just increases the pleasure and satisfaction. More please!
1,"read it, don't listen to it","I enjoyed reading this book and the series as a whole, so I picked up an audiobook copy of it to listen to in the car during the commute. I was, in a word, disappointed.Barbara Rosenblat's reading is flat, and her intonations and inflections are unnatural and stilted. I find it hard to listen to, as her artistic take on the conversations and her impersonations of military personnel are completely off and unrealistic. Her mispronunciations of simple words sometimes makes it hard to understand what's going on, and her overall characterization is low, in that it is very hard to tell which character is speaking at any time. All in all, I get the feeling she ignored the actual content and militaristic theme of the book in lieu of a very generic, pulp reading."
5,"Long, but solid","First, oldreader from GA and several others seem to have not read this book at all. The statement that ""nothing was resolved"" is preposterous. The subplots resolved and intertwined beutifully in the end, and Weber took so long to do it because his editor gave him a little leeway in which to work! The time he spent developing the side-stories gave the whole thing a wonderfully complete feel.It is a long story. Nevertheless, the whole Honor Harrington series comes in at well over 5000 pages; what's 800 in one book? I believe that the space Weber was given was well used to work his craft. Bravo to David Weber, and I can't wait until the next one!"
2,Droll and superficial,"Either Weber is infatuated with his own rhetoric or he doesn't even bother to proof his writings.C'mon David, enough of this cutesy bantering! WRITE something constructive!"
1,A long one in the series,I enjoyed this continuation of the Honor Harrington Saga.I learned more about many secondary characters.That said this one focussed more on politics than military actionand I was disappointed that Honor does not get a new love interest.
4,Editor asleep at the wheel,"I have just finished this book, and I have to agree with the majority of reviewers. This is not as good as previous books in the series. The biggest problem is that all authors need an editor who will tell them when they have gone off the rails - in this book, it doesn't look like it was edited at all. Every internal dialogue of the characters, every opportunity to explain their motivations, every last emotional detail was included in this book. After awhile, I got so weary with the build-up to the distant climax, I was skipping paragraphs to get to the parts where the characters would finally DO something.I think the publishing house sensed an opportunity to make more money with a longer book, but it would have been twice as good at half the length. No doubt I will buy and read the next episode in this saga, but another disappointment will be hard to take. After this one, I just wanted Honor's story to come to an end."
3,War of Honor- fair,While I did enjoy War of Honor it was not the best book in the series. I felt it could have been edited more tightly. The plot was a trifle contived. The characters were less vivid than usual. It was equal to several of the others but not as dramatic as the best. I would give it 3.5 stars. Wait for the paperback.I have read all of the Honor Harrington series and consider myself a fan but he has done better in the past and hopefully will do better in the future.
2,Book desperately needed an editor,"I appreciate the fact that Weber was interested in exploring Manticoran and Havenite politics in great depth. The fact that he likes going this deep with his background is one of his strengths as a writer. However, in the process he's losing sight of other writerly virtues, such as concision. This is an amazingly bloated book. There is much repetition and throughout the book its characters are made to wade through molasses-thick, endless and painfully obvious discussions of what is going on. Weber could have accomplished the same intricate and interesting setup in half the space. Because of its unnecessary length, the book became a drudge to read. Not the kind of exciting tale I expected from Weber."
5,Complex and forboding ...,"Yep, our girl is BAAAACK! And the bad taste in your mouth from the fall of the Cromarty Government was warranted -- it turns out to be as bad as we imagined. Honor contends with politics on both a personal and military level, gets involved in conflicts with both Andermani and Peep forces, Manticore also tweaks the Sollies (albeit unintentionally) for future books.This is big (800+ pages), complex (Maniticore good guys, Manitcore bad guys, Peeps of all kinds, Sidemore, Grayson) and forboding novel. Most of the novel feels like the Sword of Damocles hanging overhead.The only downside is that since this novel covers a *lot* of events setting up the next 4-5 books, you don't get as much exposure to characters such as Benjamin, Elzabeth, Michelle Henke, etc.Still, it may be the best one yet, if only because of how well all the plot advance toward a grim set of confrontations..."
2,Who wrote this book?,"This is a big disappointment in a series I haved loved for years. Although some recent editions have had 100, maybe 200 pages of introduction, this one has 800. As discussed in other reviews, lots of committees and talk, all leading to an obviously avoidable war. This is not worthy of Mr. Weber."
1,The master stumbles....,"I am a big fan of David Weber's books but this one is just not worth reading. Extremely wordy with lots of irrelevant points, you really have to be tough to slog through this brick. Might have been a good read if it was about 600 pages shorter.Take my advice, give it a miss and go read some Jack Vance. Now there is a man who can pack a story in!"
3,Another incredible Harrington novel!,"Let me just say that I love David Weber's Honor Harrington series - and I'm a latecomer. Though I'm more of an action type of guy, the political intrigue and character development of this series complement and accentuate the action extremely well. I greatly enjoyed ""War of Honor"", though I will admit that I would have loved more action - Weber seemed to want to especially dig into the political and emotional escapades of his characters in this one.But as always, when you get to the climactic battle(s) the payoff is always worth the wait. I can't say that I loved this as much as some of his more recent additions to the series (specifically Harrington's escape from the prison planet in Echos of Honor), but it definitely was worth the read.Highly recommend it! But...if you haven't ever read an Honor Harrington novel, do yourself a favor and start with On Basilisk Station. I wish I had known to start there when I discovered this incredible series."
1,War of DisHonor,"This was pure garbage. There are a lot better books out there, don't waste your time or money on this one. It was hard to get past the author's mommy complex to get to the meat of this book. Once, you get there, you wish you had not wasted the time.March Up Country and its associated books are much better."
1,Turkey,"I give this turkey 1-2 stars, it's about 500 pages too long. More or less nothing much happens for 800 pages or so and then the fighting is brief. To paraphrase the texan 'It's all hat and no battle'Alan Bale"
2,Surprising disappointment,"I've a big fan, and unfortunately, this book is just not up to par. Other folks have been frustrated by the same things that things that I'll summarize here...- space battles that are over before they start- way too many characters- endless (endless!) background explanation, to the point that often I forgot where the plot was because David Weber was off explaining some nuance that I just plain don't care about.I found myself skipping over pages at a time in reading, just to get through this. If this were any other author, or any other series, I would have stopped & wouldn't have finished the book. I slogged through it though, and after 800+ pages of buildup, even at the end, the ending came abruptly. It's as if he said ""Okay, deadline's tomorrow, lets finish this puppy""."
2,"Over written, a reader's slog.","I have read every one of Weber's books too include, sadly, this one. He has always had a tendency to bog down in the backstory and character development, but this time he has surpassed himself for sheer over-writing. The book is over 800 pages in length, and the first sign of real naval action comes after page 700. In fact, the entire thrust of Harrington as a naval action officer, comes as an afterthought. Frankly, if I wanted heavy reading with Byzantine politics and plot lines, I would have purchased a book on the history of the Holy Roman Empire. If Mr. Weber's editor and publisher pushed for this type of work, Mr Weber should take them on a trip to the woodshed. If not, then he needs to do something to alliviate the tiresome boredom of the first 700 pages in any future efforts."
2,what happened to Honor,"I was very disappointed with this effort. Way too much ""character development"" not NEARLY enough action.Honor seemed to be almost an after-thought. Will not be buying any more in this series unless Mr. Weber gets back to Honor and action."
2,Two thoughts,"I really enjoyed reading the first nine books of this series. They were a great mix of action, character development, and insight into the ""enemy's way of thinking"".This book is different. It would be great if it was labeled as ""political intrigue"".As a space opera, it is about 350 pages too long.Please please please David, don't go the route of Jordan and Goodkind. Your fans can get verbose political commentary elsewhere, we don't want it in the Honorverse."
2,A major Disappointment,"I have read all the Honor Harrington books, as well as everything else Weber has written, and I can honestly say this is the only one I did not like. Way too much talking, characterization, and scene setting. Very little action. Weber could have written the entire novel in about 100 pages, and I wouldnt have missed a thing. I hope this is just an aberrant entry in an otherwise excellent series."
1,Yawn.......the end of the road for me.,"This will probably be my last purchase in the Honor Harrington soap opera for me. Lets see....300 pages to rehash what has happened before500 pages of boring political maneuvering100 pages with some minimal action in itI guess that I am just not interested in page after page after page of the inner mental anguish of Weber's characters. Sheesh, give it a rest."
1,Arrgh! 760 pages before the first shot is fired..,"Skip forward in your reading list if you are looking for a story.This book spends the first 400 pages dealing with a minor political incident, even by todays standards.. Another 100 pages or so on deployment. A minor skermish and then finally. A whopping 75 pages on ""Honor in action"" The last page hint of the next book wasn't so subtile either.*sigh*"
2,Desperately seeking editor...,"This book needed some serious editing, but it didn't get it. The first 80% was filled with endless meetings between various characters who either rehashed what happened in the previous books or rehashed the current political situation. This book could have easily been half its length without leaving anything out and would have been a much better read in the process.I'm sorry to say it, but Weber's writing has just deteriorated over the course of the series. The characters have all lost their distinctive voices, and even if they hadn't, 90% of the dialog has become exposition in disguise. It's clear that at this point, Weber is just grinding them out to order."
2,Very disappointed,"As much as I have loved the Honor Harrington series, I was hoping this novel would bring closure to a worn out series. Much to my horror, the story in War of Honor not only refuses to end, but is thrown backwards!The unrealistic stupidity of the politicians and the over-the top intelligence of the treecats really spoiled it for me. The animals should have been running the government while the politicians perched on someone's shoulder, looking threatening.And lastly, this novels ends up with all invloved pretty much in a position they occupied a couple books ago! How many more books will be suffered through before this tale is finally brought to a conclusion?Please Mr Weber, bring this once beloved series to an end."
2,One-third of this book is good!,"In fact, that's just how I read it - skipping over the interminable talk, talk, talk. It's been a while since I've read On Basilisk Station but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have read any more Honor books if it had been this bad. I'm hooked into Weber's world creation, tho, so am stuck. Perhaps if Baen re-hired the editor they so obviously fired 5 years ago we could get at least one more decent Honor book out of Weber!"
2,Long winded rehash of the not much of anything,"After ten books, the Honor Harrington series seems to have run out of steam. Weber takes 864 pages to move the plot forward about a short stories worth. All the characters spend their time telling each other everthing that has gone before, and it's not until the last 100 pages or so that anything of substance actually happens! I've enjoyed a lot of Weber's other books, but this one is just one too many for this heroine."
1,Baen and Weber: a loss of Honor,"In the long, slow decline of the Honor Harrington saga, this work is an abrupt plunge into the depths. Filled with endless exposition disguised as conversation, Weber abandons the formula which made his early work so vibrant, and instead attempts in his usual heavy-handed way to explore the black and white world of politics.Baen should be ashamed: don't they EDIT anymore? This work cries out to be edited. And Weber should either retire Honor, or spend more time to write a cohesive novel. This one is filled with promises which it seldom delivers.If you want black and white characters, no subtlety at all, and a tedious narrative, then this one is for you. But if you are looking for the joy of the early novels, forget it, Weber has lost his way and doesn't have the discipline or skill to explore the world he has now created."
2,War Weary,"I will say this for Weber: It took 8 or 9 decent books for this series to run out of steam.Too bad, because the early books were really enjoyable. As other folks have said, ""War of Honor"" is a bit of a chore to read.Also, as other folks have pointed out, really the strongest aspect of the series is reading about Honor Harrington kicking *ss. Which is largely absent from ""War of Honor.""The truth is that ""War of Honor"" could have been decent if it had been edited down. Instead we're saddled with (literally) hundreds of pages of internal monologue, silly banter, and C-SPANesque discussion."
4,Another riveting story from one of todays better SF authors,"This book is a good value in more ways than one. The book itself is an excellent read: well worth the price, and the included CD-ROM has all the foregoing volumes in the series in several different e-book formats. New readers might want to load them on their PCs or PDAs and read those first so they get the story in order."
2,What the Devil is this all about?,"I REALLY was anxious to get my hot little hands on this. What a disappointment! 900 pages of boring dialogue, poor plot, lousy characters and maybe a 100 pages of action. And in the end all it does is set up a sequel! I may or may not read the sequel (Alright, I will read it, but I'll object.) I really hope Weber gets back on track. This stunk!"
2,"The longer the series, the poorer the stories","Unfortunately, the longer the series goes on, the more the author relies on 'gimmicks' such as the treecats' ESP powers and Honor's. I just don't enjoy the stories now."
2,"Bleh.... Not the best, not the worst","Sad to say but this was not up to the standards I expected from D. Weber based upon his other Honor books. Some parts were very long, almost minute-to-minute, other parts you'd skip over whole weeks/months and have to readjust where you were in the timeline. When I finished I was suprised at how many pages there were, over 800, and yet I barely felt like I had acutaly gotten to the true climax.Did not feel any of the breathless excitment or heated emotions that I've come to expect of the Honor series. Purely an investment for the continuation of the series. Not something I'd read again."
2,People sitting around tables discussing politics,"""A Reader from Texas"" already said everything I had planned to say. 600+ pages of people sitting around tables discussing politics. Only one full blown space battle and that was quickly over. Honor Harrington spends very little time ""on camera"". And while the overall plot of the series was perfectly poised to move on to fresh new story arcs at the end of ""War of Honor"" we seem to have taken a few steps backward.A certain amount of monotony is the price we pay for Mr. Webers finely crafted stories. And I have no doubt that his attention to the fine details is why Honor Harrington is such a well loved character. But this is without a doubt the most tedious Sci-Fi novel I have ever read. I kept hoping it was going to get better, but it just kept dragging on and on. I can only hope that in the next book Mr. Weber pulls a rabit out of his hat and throws us some surprises and new directions."
4,Book 10 still had me chomping at the bit,"I read the book in installments on Baen's websubscriptions and then bought it when it released. War of Honor nearly killed me waiting for the next set of chapters. I would ration myself to one a day. Okay... so this one was not as heavy on the Space Battles. There was more polotics. BVut that was the POINT!! There is a lull in the storm and all of the political issues lend stress and suspense to where the story is going. I think Weber did an excellent job of portraying the Star Kingdom's slide towards two potential Wars that nobody wants. If he had not had as much politics I do not think it would have worked. At the very least I would not have developed the loathing for some of the characters that made their getting their cumpupance(sp>) so sweet. Heck, I love the Action, but it the context of the Action that makes it so much more interesting."
4,If you like plausible science fiction...,"Honor Harrington is the best thing available. War Of Honor is an excellent book, maintaining the detailed universe of its predecessors and expanding upon it. The Peeps are back under a new name, with competent leadership this time, and things look grim for the star kingdom. Good, I say. I was sick and tired of watching the RMN kick the Peeps' butt all the time, it's time the field was levelled a bit. And Weber does it in such a plausible way, you don't even notice the full magnitude of the change until the last 100 pages, where... well, I'll let you find out. But anyway, read this book. Honor is different, more mature, more powerful, except for the rather lame romance bits. But I forgive that part, because it takes like 5 of the 800-some pages of goodness."
2,Too Much Work For Too Little Return,"David Weber's books are generally fun to read and go rather quickly. Sadly, this book was more of chore than a diversion. The Honor Series used to be about naval action with politics thrown in. War of Honor changes the mix and makes it a book about politics with a little naval action. I was more impressed with the CD that had all of the previous novels in various ebook formats. I can only hope Weber gets back on track with the next book."
1,Trite and boring - sadly unlike the previous books,"I felt like slitting my wrists while reading this to escape the boredom. Seriously, the series is terriffic, until this book. The lack of overt action and too much exposition where people in meetings talk talk and talk some more about previous events is enough to put the most die hard Honor fan to sleep. I agree with earlier reviews that state the editing was lacking. It was."
2,Weber's worst,"Sadly, unless you are a dedicated and brain washed member of the Weber cult, you will almost certainly find yourself skimming this over done nightmare of a novel, desperately hoping for the space battles and action that made the series worth reading in the first place - and when the action does come, you will find it sparse and unfullfilling.To date the series was characterized by excellent military action set against a believable political background. In this latest, most self indulgent, episode we are flooded by hundreds of pages of boring and over written petty politics, while the few battle scenes are dealt with in a few paragraphs - in short Weber has tragically reveresed the formula that made him a great military sci-fi author. The entire 800 page novel desperately needs to be cut down to about 250 pages, and Weber desperately needs to find an editor with the guts to get him under control and force him to return to the early style which made him worth reading in the first place."
3,"Too much talk, not enough action","Too much talk, too much lecturing, too much politics, and too much telling with not enough showing. In other words, lazy - I think Weber was bored with this one and it shows. The book needed a good editor to cut two or three hundred pages out. It's obviously just a l-o-n-g setup for the next book and thus should have been a LOT shorter. Very disappointing. I hope the next one is better."
2,a treatis on political science only,"I have read and loved every single previous Honor book, but this one truly defeated me. I found very little of the action usually found with Honor, and waaaay too much talk, talk, hundreds of pages, on politics, by Mantie, Peep, Andies, etc. This book could have been halved from its 929 pages. I found the book very boring, as Honor played a somewhat small role, compared to the Star Kingdom's political ""leaders"". I did find similarities to the current Bush regime in the USA, politically speaking.This book reminds me a lot of how the legendary Heinlein's books in later years became more and more wordy philosophy, and less and less of the actual story. Stop the hundred's pages of talk and get on with the story, for Pete's sake!!"
2,Nothing happening here,"I've followed this series from the beginning and this book is the one I least like. Nothing happens, with even the ending being disappointing - it's basically just a quick summary rather than the usual exciting finale. In 800 pages, the book is all didactic political talk and explanation. And those ""bad guys"" who get their due justice receive it all offscreen. It was such a disappointment, I wouldn't recommend the cliffsnotes for this book- they'd be boring too. And that's too bad, as the series held up well for 8 books."
1,Go for the unabridged version,"This is really the first abridged audiobook I've listened to. I did the previous 9 in the series in unabridged audiobook, but the abridged copy was what the library had.As far as I can tell, they abridged it by throwing the pages in the air and picking up 10% of them, putting them back in order and reading them.I went out to Baen and bought the eBook copy for my Sony reader, and I'm reading it there. I expect that the book is as good as the rest of the series, but I can't tell from the abridged audiobook version.I expect that the book itself is 5 stars, but this version is 1 because I can't give zero."
3,Asian-American Pride,"This CD is alright. Some of them are good. Especially, Drop N Harmony's song, ""Never No Never"". The one by Kai and Jocelyn were weak. Some of them were artists I never heard of. This CD is for R&B, love songs. Various Artists are a mix of female and male artists from groups to solo."
5,Nature- American Eagle,This is a beautiful DVD and of special interest to me as it was filmed in the Mississippi valley country I grew up in.
5,Great Film,The film gave enough information and footage on this Eagle as I would have liked. Great dvd for the avid bird-lover and for the average interested person.
2,Footage is sped up?!,"Most of the footage on this blu-ray looks slightly sped-up. This makes it look totally unnatural and stupid. Yet the audio seems to be synched up. It will show a guy speaking, with his lips moving all fast and sped up and WEIRD looking - yet the audio is normal??Other parts of the blu-ray seem normal. The majority of the blu-ray is not.Right on the blu-ray menu, the footage of eagles it was playing was sped up. I thought to myself, ""That's weird.. why on earth would they speed up this footage? Oh well whatever,"" then clicked play. I was horrified to find most of the footage in the actual show was sped up.This made me completely regret buying this product.The only reason I am not giving this 1 star is because the information about eagles was excellent.In fact it kept me watching til the end, despite the distracting unnatural looking sped-up video which ruined the entire thing.2/5"
4,Nice little movie,"This is a dare I say ""cute"" little movie. I like the way Santa makes the toys in seconds! I watched with my grandkids and they loved it. It's a good kids movie without that much for the adults. But I will watch it again this year since I'm buying it right now!"
5,Outstanding depiction of a life that lots of guys lived,"I spent a thoroughly delightful afternoon with this book and a series of mugs of beer, and I can fully agree with other interviewers that it is an absolute treasure. Relationship problems? You don't know from relationship problems, but Mike Albo does. Literary talent? Doesn't get much better. Making people remember what childhood and adolescence was like for a gay person in America? Oh, yeah. I can't use this book to put down Sedaris, who in my view is also hilarious, in a different way -- ""Santaland Diaries"", for example, must not be read while eating, because spitting up with laughter is a distinct possibility. I can put up both hands to recommend both Sedaris and Albo. I hope both of them continue to write more and more and more."
4,This is one funny book!,"This book is cute, funny, sad, insightful and a totally fresh look at growing up gay!I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever felt out of place/like an alien on this planet.Enjoy!"
2,over the top novel about growing up gay,"Mike Albo's ""Hornito"" tries to be clever, and a good novel about a perspective that is not often talked about. Mike, the narrator, talks about his various loves, while telling us how bad ""crabs"" are, and the dreadful treatment of it. We see glimpses of his childhood and high school years, and we cringe. He tells of his job, which sucks. Frankly, it tries to be comic, but it is quite dull."
3,Well....,"Well i would have to say this toy is fun, but it isnt as good as it could be.Bionicle However.......Anyway if you like action figures this is for you."
1,Teaching Systems = Standard Deviants,Don't buy Teaching Systems DVD's rather buy Standard Deviants the contents are one and the same but Standard deviants prices are extremely in-expensive
2,Not all about trucks!,"I bought this title thinking it had nothing to do with cars and only trucks. Since it is a sister publication to Motor Trend, I should have known. I just received my first copy. It is full of crossover SUV's CUV's,etc. WHY? They try to justify it buy saying that these models have grown bigger and thus should be included? Come on, you ALREADY have a car mag to include them in. When I guy a truck mag, I buy it for truck content. My guess is that it is so thin with only truck stuff, that they have to pad it with car stuff just so they can sell it."
4,not very current news,"Because of the bi-monthly printing the ""news"" of this publication is hardly up to date. I have a suggestion; go monthly and get a better pulse on the market."
2,"Heavy coverage on pickup trucks, skimpy coverage on Crossovers and SUV's","I wish they published this magazine every month even though I don't rate the magazine all that high.. The magazine has pretty heavy coverage on pickup trucks and skimpy coverage of crossovers and SUVs. In their latest issue they did a ""best of"" SUV review but didn't consider scores of popular SUV models in their ranking. For this they get two stars out of five."
1,Waste of Money,"The two bars that you can adjust to go up or down slip with little or no effort. Also, they do have an adjustment that keeps them from going in(making the bars shorter in width),but nothing to stop them from going out (wider) and tapping against the side back windows. My 3 year old female lab, who is not even 75 lbs, bent the cross bars the very first time we used it by trying to poke her head through the left side of the barrier. So if you have a dog that will sit in the back and not try to get through, this is the barrier for you."
1,So bad,Vertical bars encroached on our dogs room in the back. Made our dog nervous and he chewed and bent the metal bars down to climb out of the back. Now he tries to climb out of the back more often then before. Great!
4,You can get real with Geri,"I think the dvds are brilliant, and very effective. The second one (GeriBody Yoga) is slitly better then the first one. It's not Geri though, who leads the session, but the yogi (Katy Appleton) is really good. Geri's comments absolutly make the whole exercise so much cooler and funnier, you really can have a feeling of attending a yoga class with Geri itself. The structures of the slides are amazingly welldone, and at the end you really feel recharged, and relaxed. It's a must have dvd if you are into yoga, and a must have dvd if you aren't into yoga...my husband got into it...so it does work on anybody. Namaste!"
3,"Geri is lovely, but the dvds aren't great for regular use.","Geri Halliwell has an engaging way about her and the camera just loves her (and vice versa). But both of these dvds move too slowly to be of much use after learning the routine. Some of the poses are best done after really warming up the body, which the slow pace doesn't allow to happen. Doing these poses (like the shoulder stand), without being totally warm and loose, could lead to injury. I prefer a more brisk, athletic style of yoga, whereas what is shown here is more focused on slow, deep breathing and very advanced poses (at least for me!)."
5,Hip Hop bass till you drop,I think this title is the best one Freak Nasty has done. It is much better than the previous one as it has many more song to listen to. The bass is really brought out in this album. It is really good. I recommend you buy it.
4,A good start,"I was terrified of starting this book because the author, Greg Cox. In Tales of the Slayer volume 2, his big monster, is an overly massive vampire squid???! Vampire Squid? You're kidding me, right? Luckily this book wasn't so crazy. Most parts were pretty realistic, except for the end. I enjoyed it, but the most of the other books in the series. Read it if you want, but not 100% neccesary unless you're a fan."
3,Bonney is to placid throughout,"Having heard most of these English chestnuts from great British exponents like Alfred Deller and Janet Baker, with occasional American interloping from Dawn Upshaw and Kathleen Battle, I expected Barbara Bonney to sing at the same exalted level. for me, she doesn't. The voice is as beautiful as it has ever been, and she bends over backwards not to sound modern and/or operatic (her accent remains mostly American, however). But the style throughout is bland and pallid. I accept the Amazon reviewer's comment that this is intimate music, but don't passions come out most in such moments? Not here, because everyone involved -- not just Bonney but the accompanying musicians -- treads on gossamer. What sounds soothing over two songs becomes annoying over fifteen."
3,A dissenting view,"I listened to this CD in my car several times. I agree that Bonney's voice is lovely, but I had to consult the booklet to get all the words and the accompaniment was barely audible. To my ear, the vocal color is too monochromatic and the tempi too similar, thus every song sounds like a lament. However, those who prize unity over variety will like this CD."
4,Fairest Voice,"I really can't say much more than the other reviewers, but I wanted to add to the support of this disc. I gave it 4 stars because I feel the selection of pieces could have been better picked, but I suppose that's a personal thing. Barbara Bonney's voice is fantastic, beautiful, and really speaks the intent and emotion behind the music.If you're even a little interested, buy this CD. The Editorial Review also was dead on the mark."
2,Not As Good As A Casio,"You'd better get a magnifying glass if you plan on using the calculator. The print is way too small to read. I'd get another Casio if I was buying again. The problem with my 2-year-old Casio calculator watch is that you have to send it in to Casio to be ""repressurized"" after you get the battery changed. That costs $20 plus postage, plus the time without the watch. I thought this Timex would do the trick, but the calculator is practically useless unless you use it several times a day and memorize the buttons. Anybody know of a tiny calculator that will fit in a watch pocket?"
3,okay product,"purchase and delivery of the item was great. on-screen functionality is great. indiglo button is hard to push. every button press makes a beep, would like a silent option. worst part is the watchband lug ends. they are not the same size on both ends so you can't get a different style in men's sizes."
1,Glossy and pretty but lacking in substance,"This book seems to be mostly fluff and pictures. It's all in full color which makes it appealing to the eye, and the pictures and general information about various locations are interesting. However, it's almost useless in planning a trip.All the hotels and restaurants are listed at the back of the book (separate from the other information about the cities, which in itself is annoying because you have to flip back and forth), and the selection they list seems completely random. For many cities no hotels or restaurants are listed.National Geographic would do well to cut down on the pretty colors and pictures and expand the actual information provided in this book. As it is now, it is a waste of money. Buy the Lonely Planet guide if you want practical information that will actually help you to plan and enjoy a trip to Thailand."
1,Disgusting.,"REA's AP World History is in no way comparable to the well made Princeton Review's books. Many questions are incorrect as well as the scoring guide printed in the book.Unless you enjoy review books that are extremely dry, do not purchase this book. I returned this book the day I recieved it."
2,REA's new World History Guide,"Unfortunately, this book does not nearly compare to REA's APUSH book. The writing is very dry, probably since this book is written by only one person. and why does she insist on praising ancient civilizations for being ""very tolerant""? this book is, however, pretty comprehensive, and if you like reading dry writing and share her love of tolerance, then this book is for you."
3,"Experimental: good on the stage, less interesting to read","I chose Sarah Ruhl's plays as a source of language for an advanced EFL course, wanting an example of contemporary American English. The situations and word play, however, make her work unsuitable for this. While I did appreciate her work from a literary point of view, I didn't really find her work on a par with what the hype had brought me to expect. She is definitely interesting, but perhaps she tries too hard to be different, with mixed results"
5,late delivery!,"I ordered this book to be delivered in two days, and paid extra. It was delivered four days later. This is not only bad advertising, bad publicity, dishonesty, but clearly financial overcharging! It is a shame that Amazon will receive bad reviews from this incident from a university professor!"
4,Hot New Writer,"I read a profile of Sara Ruhl in THE NEW YORKER and was intrigued by the lack of psychologizing in her plays. So I bought a book of her plays. There's some good stuff in there, and some very cliched aspects as well. Ruhl seems to suffer from a bit of shame deriving from her white midwestern roots."
4,Ideas for Holy Holidays,Well so far it is okay. I have a lot of children so some ideas are too much for the younger ones or too young for the older ones but I think I can make them work. Overall it is a great book.
2,What happened?,"Any book about WWII, American History, and U.S. Presidents is an automatic read for me because they are my favorite subjects. That is why I am still perplexed about how Mr. Beschloss could have messed this one up. The story is told from people's points of view rather than independent investigation. I stopped reading about a quarter way through and passed it on."
2,Deceptive title,I agree with a few others. This book is about Henry Morgenthau and his ideas. I was disappointed with how much he mentioned him way too much in this book. It was a turn-off and a deceptive book cover.
2,Over-hyped,"This is a bit of let down. While the title, art, and blurb lead you belive this book is all about the presidential actions and thoughts during the destruction of Nazi Germany, it is really the account of the Treasury Secretary Henry Morganthau. While it does offer snippets of conversations with both presidents and some insight on actions they took and did not take, it is a far cry from a tick-tock of the war or even the process at the WH. Best evidence? Morganthau gets 4 columns in the index, Roosevelt 1.5."
1,Minutae Minutae Minutae Minutae,"Brutal display of trivial details of the war years seen through Henry Morganthau. Totally deceiving title and cover. A very hard read, minute by boring minute account of fragmented conversations and excerped documents. No real no need for chapter headings, cause it's just one long yatta yatta yatta! Just because a record's been uncovered doesnt mean it should not stay covered."
2,THE CONQUERORS,"A VERY DISAPPOINTING AND FOR THE MOST PART BORING BOOK. THE BOOK IS NOT REALLY ABOUT FDR AND PRESIDENT TRUMAN AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS, BUT RATHER IS ABOUT HENRY MORGENTHAU, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, A LITTLE MOUSEY MAN I HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN. SORRY, BUT I WAS GLAD WHEN I WAS FINISHED AND COULD GO ON TO READ SOMETHING BETTER. GEORGE"
3,informative,"a constant thread or rope of antisemitism is illustrated in this book of late WW11 history. King roosevelt/truman and their administrations are both guilty. Sec. Morgenthau,a jew, a close friend of roosevelt is able to do nothing to save european jews.What is to be done with germany? The book is interesting in filling in the shadows of how our government thought in the 40's. the hard lesson Morgenthau and the world learned is that nobody feels confortable or really is willing to help a jew who is not a jew. Not even our leaders. Too blunt? The church has seen to that mistrust over two thousand years of hate. Antisemitism was part of Roosevelt's and Truman's very make-up."
2,not that informative,"i found this book somewhat, well, less that i had expected it to be. i like WWII books, but just couldn't get into this one."
2,very limiting.,THis book takes a higly detailed look at a very limited era. It is a difficult read full of minutia about a period no one really cares too much about. The devot history lover will find it more interesting to read about Richard Nixon and his Senate follies rather than this rah-rah US propogranda.
2,Book about Henry Morgenthau,"This is a book about Henry Morgenthau and his plan to make Germany an agricultural country after the war, and to take away all German industry.It is also about Morgenthau and his conversion from an accounting type to one that wanted to help his fellow Jews after he found out about the German death camps.Roosevelt and Truman are included as supporting actors in this book about Morgenthau.The book probably took 11 years to write because the author must have been as bored writing it as I was reading it."
2,The Conquerors,"Should be retitled; Politics & World War II according to Henry Morgenthau. Mr. Beschloss didn't quite make it with this one, no matter what Don Imus says.."
2,Bait and Switch,"Despite the title, this isn't a story about the destruction of Hitler's Germany. It's not about FDR. It's not about President Truman. It's really about Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the Treasury during World War II. It mostly details his thoughts that the Germans should really be punished after the war. It says very little about how the Marshall plan eventually won out.All in all, an unimportant book primarily about a figure of no lasting historical significance. The title is shamefully misleading."
3,why all the stuff about Morganthau??,"I'm just half-way through The Conquerors, but have already concluded that the title of the book and the photos on the cover are really misleading. So far, the book is totally focused on Henry Morganthau, not Roosevelt, Truman, or Churchill. Why? Maybe I'll find out in the second half, if I don't drop the book first. Morganthau's behavior, as described by Bechloss, is petty, obsessive, and if his plan for post-war Germany had been followed (I think I know enough about history to know that it wasn't) would have given Germany enough grievances to give birth to another Hitler and start WWIII.This is a great subject and there is a lot of interesting information here, but meanwhile page after page of Monganthau goes on...and on...and on."
2,Lacking substance,"I was quite disappointed in this book. The first 3/4 seem to be spent as Henry Morgentheau vs. Everybody in the Roosevelt Administration, and all it is how Roosevelt can't decide or won't commit on the Morgentheau plan while everybody else tries to persuade him otherwise. It picks up a little when Truman takes over, but not a great deal. It has enlightened me as to how all of this unfolded, but, in my opinion, could have been much better. I don't know if there's a better alternative."
2,"henry morgentheau - not ""the conquerors""","Mr. Beschloss put this book on the shelf for 10 years for a reason: it is incomplete. In the end, I found myself cheated because it is cleary an account from Henry Morgentheau's ( then secretary of the treasury) perspective in dealing with Roosevelt. It is as if Michael Beschloss ran into Henry Morgentheau II ( who is quoted frequently in the book) and got all his dad's notes.Truman is a footnote in the last few chapters. The chapters on the attempt to assassinate hitler by his own people was misplaced and didn't support the title of the book.It was an easy and entertaining read, yet I felt cheated at the end."
3,"Nothing New Here, More of a Morganthau Biography","While this book is interesting because you get an inside look at the internicene goings on in Roosevelts administration, there was nothing new really revealed to this reader on US plans for a post-war Germany. To me it was more of a biography of Roosevelt's Treasury Secretary, Morganthau."
4,A Different Slant,"The title is misleading as the scope of this book is narrow in focus. Notwithstanding that, this book is very worthwile to someone interested in the Second World War. Yes, it does appear at times that this book is a biograhpy of Morganthou. However, there is fresh information and look at the political influences behind the Allies post war plans for Germany.The book does amplify Churchill's foresight in his concern of a post-war Soviet Union. The decisions may not have been as rationally made by the Roosevelt administration as one would expect; however, the book illuminates post war thinking of a strong or weak Germany to provide a buffer or balance for the Soviet Union.A must read for students of the political history of World War II."
4,Better than Expected Account of Post-WWII Plans,"This is significantly better than Bechloss's most recent work (an aimless, wandering study of Lyndon Johnson), mainly because he delves into the character of the characters here. This country needs another Roosevelt, especially after how we've started out in the 21st century so far.Henry Morgenthau is perhaps the most intriguing figure in the book, detailing his initial reluctance, and then his later measured efforts to convince Roosevelt of having a robust post-war plan for Germany. How Roosevelt came to reject his plan while taking decisive action on behalf of the exile and death camp-imprisoned Jews will rivet you.You won't learn anything new here, but still it was better than I expected and I can easily recommend it."
1,Bio of Henry Morganthau,"This book is not about The Conquerors. It is the wartime biography of Henry Morganthau, Roosevelts Secretary of the Treasury. The primary source for the book appears be Morganthau who comes off as playing petty politics. The perspective provided in the book is also Morganthau's. Where is Stimson, Marshall, Eisenhower and Truman?The most interesting parts describe Roosevelts poor skills as an administrator; how much his illness affected his administration and the way he played his cabinet members off of one another."
3,Popular History,"An easy read. Written to be a best seller, not a history. The book is more about Morgenthau than either FDR or HST. A comparison of the sections on Truman (the resignation of Morgenthau is a good example) with ""Truman"" by David McCulough shows the slant. But Beschloss' main reference in Morgenthau III.On a par with History Channel. Still, a money maker for the author. Not unlike Ambrose's more recent works.GFH"
3,Once again a very US-centric view of the world,"After reading this book, as well as a few other written by US biogrophers, I wonder how children in this country ever get to understand the world at large. Sure, most countries and most civilizations are proud of their past and will obviously be biassed to some extent when describing many events. The problem here is that anyone reading many of the books written from a US stand-point leave one thinking that the rest of the world were, and still are, supporting cast. Hollywood has had the same effect.I also read an account by Churchill many years ago. His account was obviously also biassed toward the part that the British played in the events of WWII, but he does credit the many allies with their part. The war was really between two groups of nations, not just the US and Nazi Germany with bit-parts played by the rest of the European and Asian nations.Oh, YES, I am a US Citizen."
4,Outstanding,The Conquerors by Michale Beschloss is one of my new faviort books on the market. If you are a history buff like myself i highly recomand this book for you. The book starts a bit slow but soon explodse with the first atempt to kill Adof Hitler.The book starts off with the United States Presendint Roosevelt and soon leads into Trumans Rain. I really could go on for hours about this great read but i dont whant to spoile the whole book for you. i highly recomand this read for a history buff like myself. plez give it a chance you will love it.
4,good for sneaky little brothers,"i bought this for my boyfriend who has a sneaky little brother, and it does a great job for him!"
2,"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing","I am always amazed at how overwhelmingly positive the reception of Alvin's book has been. When sycophantic readers describe this book as one of the greatest works of metaphysics of 'all time' (see above), I take personal effront. Granted, Alvin is a kind and witty man, but his treatment of de re modality and possible worlds theory leaves much to be desired--however 'funny' that treatment may be. Alvin is clear, to be sure--clearly wrong. Nevertheless, as a colleague and friend, I am both professionally and personally obliged to recommend this book unreservedly. I would strongly advise you spend your time reading 'counterfactuals' instead, but, alas, this book is now out of print. Then again, if we are to believe Al, this is just a modal accident."
4,You Can Lose Yourself In This Book,"I didn't realize that this was the second book in a trilogy when I started it (My fault. It was clearly stated on the front of the book). That may be why I found the numerous characters a bit confusing at first. But there is a list of characters and the villages they come from at the back of the book and that was a big help. I also appreciated the glossary of plants and herbs that were mentioned in the story. Despite the fact that I was unfamiliar with these characters and their past history with each other, the story was easy to follow. I found the details of life in primitive times, in the wilds of Alaska, mesmerizing. The suspense of what was going to happen to these characters kept me turning pages well into the wee hours. It isn't often that I find a book that so involves me, that the rest of the world just disappears for awhile. This is one of those books."
4,Harrison continues to write top notch material,"As with the other books by this author that I have read, she continues to spell bind and ""spin"" a good yarn. She has the ability to make you feel as if your in the story looking on."
5,wow,"Again thank you for great service looking forward to more good books, will be checking for more of your ad,s for books that i enjoy reading you give me great choices"
1,One star is too high!,"I thought this slicer would be a really wise purchase...sturdy & would brighten my kitchen. Wrong, wrong, wrong...it lasted all of two weeks, then as others have experienced, the wires all popped! Wished I'd checked Amazon's feedback before my purchase. Mine was an in-store purchase and expensive (for an egg-slicer). Of course, I'd already thrown away my cash receipt (ah,well). Then bought a Farberward slicer...very nice looking (black) sturdy (thus far) & I really like it...for less than a third the price of the Kitchen Aid.Love the feedback on Amazon! Helps us all be a whole lot more satisfied consumers when we can draw on others positive and negative experiences with their shopping choices!!"
1,Bad Product By A Good Company,"It's that simple.This is an inferior product made by a company well known for quality merchandise.I purchased one of these egg slicers based solely upon previous good experience with KitchenAid brand products.The obvious flaws in use are well covered by the two previous reviewers.KitchenAid should either re-engineer it, even if re-pricing is required, or simply stop selling it under their brand name, as it can only hurt their reputation.."
1,Sorely disappointed,"I must begin by saying my kitchen is 100% KitchenAid in Empire Red. I adore their gadgets and utencils...and then I came across this egg slicer.A good egg slicer is hard to find, and to find one matching my set..needless to say I was excited. But the first time I tried it, the wires simply popped out. It takes very little pressure to slice a hardboiled egg, but this poor slicer couldn't take itI am very surprised, considering the high quality of the other products that I own. I am on a hunt for another red egg slicer."
1,kitchen aid egg slicer,"The first one lasted one week instead of the promised one year. The replacement lasted for about two weeks. These gadgets are not up to slicing mushrooms at all! They may be ok for eggs but, at heart are just not up to the mushroom task. Too bad. So sad. I'm mad."
5,The coolest kitchen tool ever!!!,I have sliced and chopped eggs for years by hand until my husband got this egg slicer for me. I love it!!! It matches my pots and other kitchen utensils which I love and is a kitchen aid product which I trust.
1,I expected more from this brand!,"I ordered this Egg Slicer, I had to wait about six weeks because they weren't out yet. After it arrived I used it to slice mushrooms (listed on the package), the wire broke the first time I used it. I returned it with no problem and had it replaced. The second one also broke the first time I used it (also on mushrooms - which is what I purchased it for). I returned that one and got my money back to go buy a 2.99 at the grocery store that actually works."
1,Why can't they make this slicer right ?,"I agree with Bob. My first egg/mushroom slicer was broken (the wire) after several use (it was in 20th century). My second egg/mushroom slicer was broken (again just the wire) after the second use (This was 21st century). Sorry for being sarcastic, but do we need some NASA's rocket science to make this slicer right ? Even MicroSoft can make it better. MicroSoft should be in this business..."
4,"Simple to understand, easy to practice","I read the book, found it very simple to follow and understand. The exercises are easy to do and will give the reader the opportunity to experience the etheric energy in all of us. Some of the exercises are so practical that I have include some of them in my own routine for meditation and morning stretching.Nevertheless, if you are not open in this search for answers and looking forward to continue growing spiritually and emotionally, this book might be too much. For this reason, I rate it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,"buy ""old school"" instead","ok, since the age of 9, I've grown up listening to 7 seconds. I still have, and listen to, the original tapes that I acquired over the years (old school, walk together rock together, new wind, and (most recently) alt.music.hardcore)...in my opinion, all of those albums are better than ""the crew""...maybe at 22 I'm just so used to them sounding like they were recorded in someone's garage that this album seems to lack something in its sound. And as far as I'm concerned, the songs that appear on this album that were also on the others I named above, sound much better on those other albums than on this one. Overall, this isn't a terrible album and does have some great songs that don't appear on those other albums such as ""Not just boys fun"", ""Bully"", and ""Trust""...the live tracks, however, were very unimpressive. Anyways, thats my opinion."
5,Great book!!!,(...) this book was so cool. My teacher used to be a 3rd grade teacher so she has a lot of kid books. My friend and I were looking for a book and we found this one. We loved the kid in the big space suit. It was hilarious. So now almost every time at reading time we look for that book and we find it better and better each time. This book is so cool especially if you're in for a funny and short book. Even older kids who have a humorous side to them will enjoy this book.-Allison G. (...)
1,Misleading,For Christians only. Pagans be warned that this book is simply Christian perspective on why paganism is wrong. Pathetic and one-sided.
5,Enlightening to all believers... a light in the darkness of history,"You'll be shocked at Blaise Pascal's spirtual wisdom in the 1660's, and at how historians havecompletely misunderstood and ignored him and his intentions.T.S. Elliot said it best long ago:""I can think of no Christian writer, not Newman even, more to be commended than Pascal to those who doubt, but who have the mind to conceive, and the sensibility to feel, the disorder, the futility, the meaninglessness, the mystery of life and suffering, and who can only find peace through a satisfaction of the whole being."" T.S. Elliot"
4,Good beginner spanish,"Being in New Mexico this was a great beginner for me, I hear spanish on a daily basis so I can understand more and it is easier for me to pick up, worth the amount."
1,Don't buy this course,The *lessons* are a joke - If I wanted to hear someone read a list of spanish words for three hours I'd go back to junior high spanish. Spend your money someplace else!
3,Not for those who have experience with Spanish,"Hi,I've taken three years of High School Spanish and one semester 100 level course at Pace University. I have a good understanding of Spanish Grammar but I wanted a refresher and listening comprehension help so can go on to intermediate and advanced courses.The entire book is separated into chapters that shows you what to say in given situations. There is also a conjugated verb section but I don't see that as any help. The audio CD's are nothing but a native speaker saying the bolded words from the book.My recommendation:-If you want to learn common phrases for basic conversations. This book will get you by.-If you want to one day gain fluency use a textbook.I recommend Basic Spanish Grammar by Jarvis Lebredo and Mena-Ayllon. There are so many courses out there and so little money to try them out.Finally I'd like to say good luck to everyone who attempts a new language.Take care!"
2,for pronounciation only,this set is probably good for pronouniation and giving you some phrases to parrot in a tourist situation. but if you are wanting to really learn the language you will need much more. also there are typos and places where the tapes do not match the book. in this price range i would reccomend oxford take off in latin american spanish instead.
2,Not for the car,"I bought this book because of the ""lessons"" on the CDs, planning to listen and learn in the car. The CDs are entirely Spanish words. No English. No lessons.You can ""listen and repeat,"" but you have no idea of what you are saying. This course might be OK for those who can sit down and read the book. It is not for those who want to listen and learn."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The cost of this product is less than $20. For less than $20 you cannot realistically expect for a course to make you conversational. However, it is reasonable to expect to learn some Spanish words and phrases. And this course undoubtedly delivers on its promise to teach the listener how to speak and recognize (hear) some Spanish words and phrases."
5,"St. Croix Triumph Spinning Rods; Model: TRS50ULM (5' 0"", UL, 1 pc.)",Love St. Croix. Cant beat them for the price. awsome warranty also
3,Over thier head!,"While I am usually a huge fan of Bid Idea and VeggieTales, this one went way over my kids' heads. Don Quiote? Come on! And while Sheerluck was funny in a slap-stick sort of way, there was too much going on visually to get the whole plot. Okay for kids 8 and up, but not for the little guys. Try instead the older VT movies like Dave and the Giant Pickle or The Toy the Saved Christmas."
5,Veggie Tales Rock!,I love veggie tales. Always great lesson for children to learn. This dvd is about friendship such as not being selfish in your friendship and give your friends some credit too. Great rendition of Sherlock Holmes. Great characters and stories to teach wonderful values in life.
2,Not a Favorite,"To be perfectly honest, I have tried to watch this with my daughter 2 times, and we have never made it past the first half. By the time we get to the ""Sheerluck Holmes"" portion of the episode, we have lost interest and moved on to something else.So far my daughter's favorites are: Lord of the Beans, Lyle the kindly Viking, and A Snoodles Tale!"
2,"I thought it was a book, not a DVD that was in a bad way","Binding Unknown, I thought it was a Book, but it was a bad DVD, It skips at the ""man from Lamache"". I am very disappointed in the way it was delivered, the case all cracked. My kids like the stories. But I do Not like a seller that does not say it is a DVD and sells you a bad dvd. I had not time to contact the seller, I have 3 kids and not time to do that."
5,Usual great story from Veggie Tales,"As always, a great story with a good message for kids. This spoofs Sherlock Holmes stories. Laughter for all ages."
5,If you can last through the La Mancha skit....,"I didn't love the La Mancha skit on this one. Neither did my children. However, we REALLY loved the silly song and the Sheerluck Holmes portion of this DVD. As always, the music is great and the humor is wonderful. The best part of course is the wonderful values taught. Thanks, Big Idea!"
4,Engaging enough but for the kiddies only,The stories and characters should be enough to make the Veggie Tales series one of the best. Yet I'm constantly irritated with the amateurish voices. It makes me appreciate real actors and their voice creations. Still the story carries the movie and the kids don't mind the irritating voices. Sheeluck is clever and I give 5 stars to the writing.
3,Cheap,Shamrock is wearing off. Thought it would be on both sides of the ring; but is only on one side. Ring bends under the pressure of removing caps.
2,Workout video........that's it.,"This DVD set is an instructional demonstration designed for aerobic workouts. It starts by demonstrating each boxing technique THEN combines them in an aerobic and endurance workout. For instance, the jab, upper cut and power punch on a heavy bag was demonstrated. Those three punches were then combined in a 3 minute workout. This seems more like any other gimmick workout video, BUT incorporates boxing as it's medium. The home user will need to purchase a heavy bag, speed bag, jump rope, bag gloves, wraps, and many times, acquire a training partner.The instructor is voiced over while the demonstrators show, in detail, how to accomplish these workouts. A beginner and advanced DVD is included. Boxing can improve your cardio as well as tone your body efficiently. Be aware that buying cheap equipment will cause injury."
5,read,amazing combination of herbs. best cure for ear ache. put some on cotton ball put in ear. good for acne.
1,Give It a Decent Burial,"I have in the past enjoyed the Alex Delaware novels but not so much for the last several books in the series. This one however, I did not even finish. I tried. I thought the beginning was very good, it started slowing down about 1/4 through, started seriously dragging about halfway, and when he spent a full page describing how he and Milo got lost and finally found the street they were looking for, I started asking myself did I really care who did it anymore. The story was so long and drawn out that I lost track of the clues and the direction. This was not entirely my fault as the book lost track of its direction a long time before I did."
1,Enough is Enough,"This book is the end all for Alex, Milo, & the rest of the gang. It was so boring & frustrating, that it took me two weeks to skim through it & read the last page. The characters have run their course & it is time to say good-bye. I donated my book to the local library & was told that they have too many copies. Is this just a coincidence-I guess not. I will stick by his textbooks, but this book ended my reading relationship with these characters."
2,Reading this was . . . murder,"An intriguing start. I was all set to enjoy myself. Then the meandering started and continued and continued. I kept at it (somewhat foolishly, I guess) but it didn't get any better. The outcome was--well--not all that great of a surprise. Think you have to be a fan of the series. . ."
4,Another Solid Thriller,"I love Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, and THE MURDER BOOK doesn't disappoint. Kellerman knows that in a series, the ongoing lives of the characters is just as important, if not more important, than the main plot. Alex's relationship with Robin is on the rocks, and I turned the pages to find out what would happen with them as well as to learn about the murder book.Another good read along these lines is NIGHTMARE by Steven Harper. It puts a serial killer in a very different setting, and you care about the characters just like you do with the Alex Delaware novels. Highly recommended."
1,The Murder Book,"I looked forward to getting Kellerman's new book. I've enjoyed his previous books. What a disappointment this one is! I'm just sorry I bought the darn thing instead of getting it from the library. I never got beyond the second chapter. The book was so full of swearing etc. that it turned me right off. I started skipping parts to see if the story was worth it - I had to skip pages! With so many wonderful reads out there, I tossed this one. It wasn't worth my time. Come on Jonathan - let's cut out the trash and get back to writing a good story."
4,Milo saves the day,"If you're coming to this book for a psychological thriller featuring Alex Delaware's expertise, you won't find it here. Alex frankly seems somewhat of a goofball amateur detective. Aside from the major coincidence of being friends with or having connections to crucial characters, Alex's main skill seems to be searching the internet with google.On the other hand, Milo shines. We learn more about his history, and experience things from his perspective. Milo is the one who reads characters like Alex should be doing, and shows why he's a great detective. Milo is a breath of fresh air in the Delaware series, and keeps the book from being just another generic mystery by any author."
2,Shabby Ending,"This book was OK until it seemed like the author said to himself, ""I've got enough pages. Let me see if I can end the book in the next 4 chapters."" This good story was totally ruined by the ending. I will NOT be reading this author again."
3,Good Twist,"I found this book to be a little slow, but it did have a good twist towards the end. I felt the ending could have been a little more explosive. The way the two missing characters turned up and how they tied into the overall plot, set up for an explosive ending. The book is a good read overall."
5,Annother fine Kellerman offering!,"This novel delivers in every way! It starts with a hook that makes you simply HAVE to turn the pages. The character development is as always with Mr. Kellerman, superb! As in any series, it is always great to revisit ""old friends"" in terms of the main characters, and learn new things about them. This book has a great beginning, middle and end...what more can you ask for? I don't give out plot information in my reviews, I only say that this book is definitely a must-have for any Kellerman fan or any suspense novel fan as well. Kudos to Kellerman!"
2,Yawn!,"This is not one of Kellerman's best books. I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective. As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar. This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy. I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one. If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better."
5,One of the best!,"I've read about 6-7 of Kellerman's Alex Delaware's novels, and this was definitely one of the best. While some could tell you that the story line might be implausible - a 20 year old unsolved murder somehow getting resurrected and the culprits still actively involved with hiding their involvment - it is nevertheless a very interesting book and one that I found difficult to put down. All I know is that it had great entertainment value, and, after all, that's what I am looking for in a novel. When I find myself taking a book with me everywhere and reading it every spare moment, I know I've found a great one. Others can say what they want about the literary value and the writer's style, but as far as I'm concerned, this one had great entertainment value and that;s what I want."
2,Tedious and Tasteless,"While I enjoyed the fleshing out of the character Milo, I found the story disgusting and tedious. The last few books in this series have been pretty poor attempts at the hard boiled school and this one sinks even lower. The writing and plot are hardly up to the standards set in earlier efforts. Kellerman has lost his way and to say this book is disappointing is an understatement. A repugnent waste of time in which Alex's profession is irrelevannt as there is little that is psychological here. Perhaps the author needs therapy or just a writer's workshop. At any rate, there is certainly something wrong. A session with Dr. Gregory in Boulder might help."
5,Another Great Story,What an awesome book! It was also nice to get a little history on Detective Milo Sturgis. Keep up the good work! Can't wait for the next book! Maybe that one will resolve the issues between Alex and Robin.......
4,I'M HOOKED,"I'm not an easily enticed reader, if the author can't grab me within the first few pages,I won't continue to read it.But this is one that caught me.I enjoyed the characters in this novel very much.Alex Delaware, Milo of course the most.And although the outcome was a bit easy to surmise it was the dialouge between the characters that kept the pages turning and Kellerman's style of writing.The reason why I did't give this novel 5 stars was because I got a little bored of the bad guys,with the exception of one villian.But all in all it was a good read and I am about to start another Alex Delaware novel today."
1,Defenestrate this book,"That's what I did once I had finished it. Unfortunately, I live on the first floor, but wished that I lived on the tenth so that the book (and all of its hollow stereotypically characters) could have the time to contemplate how it had misused my time before it was dashed to pieces. A pack of dingoes to rend it completely, Bradbury's firemen to burn the kerosene soaked pieces and multiple horesemen to carry the remaining ashes to the four corners of the globe would have been an even sweeter revenge. This book stands for everything that readers hate about best sellers and must have been karmic punishment. Rather than read the book, please take several Percoset and five tumblers of Jack Daniels. The synaptic loss will be equivalent and if you never wake up, no big deal. The only reason that I finished it was to see how bad it could get. My reaction is mentioned in the ""review"" title."
2,Sorry State of Affairs,"I've enjoyed Kellerman's books, even when they were not his best work, but this one is not only mind-numbing but contains an error that SHOULD have been caught and and has thus spoiled the whole book for me.Call me picky, but when JK describes one of the important ""bit"" players as being 55 years of age, and even goes to some lengths to support that (he maps out her schooling and how old she was at that time) and then expects me to swallow the idea she was a teenager just 20 years ago... Well, you do the math.I thought maybe it was a typo, but no, rechecking it 3 times it still comes out wrong. Says to me JK maybe needs to take a vacation. A very long one.The rest of the book is so slow I'm about to go into a coma. There is nothing there to hold my interest, in spite of what all the glowing sycophantic reviews from other readers have to say. dull dull dull dull.Oh for a new John Sandford novel!"
2,It required patience to finish. In one word: SLOW,"What a ""piece of work"" this was. Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT ""the bomb"" ;). It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience. There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book. Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one."
2,Not nearly his best stuff,"I found this book to be cumbersome to read, filled with too many boring conversations, non-enticing tidbits, and not enough of Robin, or even suspense (yawn). I'm an avid Kellerman fan, but this one definitely didn't make the grade with me. I found I had to force myself to pick it up from time to time, something that has never happened to me with one of his books before - usually I can't put them down! I kept finding myself thinking, ""did Kellerman really write this book?"" It felt rather offbeat for him. I bought the hard copy, but wish I had rented this one from the library."
1,Horrible Book,"This book is really bad. The author goes out of his way with descriptors--to the point where I'm really bored. In fact, mid-way through the book, I came to expect long paragraphs of mindless adjectives. Even when the characters are developed, there's STILL long diatribes about what they're thinking. Hey Kellerman, give us readers some credit for having a little imagination of our own. (Does he include all the description, so he can sell it to Hollywood??)Definitely ""pass"" on this one...."
2,Slow moving,I have been trying to read this book for over a month now and just cannot get into it. It is slow moving and not enough actions or events that keep you locked in. The flashback to 20 years earlier seemed to take 20 yrs to get through.
4,Best thing he's done in years!,"I think Mr. Kellerman finally decided to break out of his rut, a little bit! There are still the usual elements there: Milo and Alex get involved in a case, Alex goes alone and gets in trouble, Milo clashes with LAPD authority. The good news is that some of the novel (probably 30%) is written from Milo's perspective, and not in the first person. We get to learn a little more about Milo's past, which is a good thing. I've always thought his character is more interesting than Alex Delaware, and it is a nice change to follow him around for a while.Sensing the boredom of Alex and Robin's relationship, Kellerman gives it a shake-up. This has happened before, but it is good to see some downs in their life, just like normal life. This is a solid effort, the best he has done in quite a while. If you are a fan, get it! If not, then I think it will still be a decent read."
2,Exhausted and Bored!,"In reading this Kellerman novel I find the switch from first person to third person exhausting. I find the decription of events taking place too long and decription of characters too short. The characters are boring. The detective work is slow. Not to mention the significance of Alex Delaware's failing relationship to the rest of the story line eludes me. Kellerman seems to be writing just to see his own pen. The story line feels like it is taking the 20 years it spans to be delievered.On a more upward note, I love the third person narrative of Milo's character. The explaination and interaction of the homosexual relationship between Milo and his partner Rick is wonderfully described and I found it very interesting.In the end I find this book very disappointing and frustrating. Not what I would consider a New York Time best selling author to deliver."
2,Need glasses?,Because this covers so many years the print is very small and the pictures are blurry. Not very well laid out at all. Very difficult to find what you are looking for.
4,Excellent on many levels,"While it is unlikely that Jeffrey Hart will succeed in writing George W. Bush out of conservatism as Whittaker Chambers did Ayn Rand, he certainly tries. Overall, his survey of National Review's half century is an excellent account of the magazine and its personalities, of the major conservative intellectual trends, and of their application to and commentary on history as it developed over the past fifty years. There exists an uneasy tension between Hart the NR editor, Hart the historian and Hart the political commentator and the author's tendency towards editorializing about contemporary issues that historians are unlikely to deem particularly important will probably prevent what is otherwise one of the better books about American conservatism from standing independent of the place and time of its publication. That said, it is eminently readable and well worth the price."
2,The Dead Man. More like The Dead Season.,"Season 3 had its moments but overall it is by far lame. The first and second season are hilarious and full of witty remarks and shows great character. It also helps in identifying what makes Dethklok; Dethklok. The third season just has a bunch of lude, crude and grotesque comments and the dialogue is supar at best. It also has an extreme amount of adult content. What made the other seasons so great was the blurs, the bleeps and the run around on what they were actually referring to. I absolutely love this show and have the first two season memorized by heart. I was thrilled for the third season and when I finally got to see it was throughly disappointed with it. I know these guys can do better."
3,Too much swearing!,"I agree with a couple of reviewers here - the series is funny as anything, I'm a huge fan, but Season 3 has taken a turn towards more profanity that can really curb your enjoyment of the DVD.The unrated version doesn't cover them up with the pinch harmonic sound effect, so we are left to endure an endless barrage of swearing by the characters. It really gets very distracting and is totally over the top.Still, it is very funny, the music will blow your mind, and the series finale is spectacular."
1,Disappointed,"I was sent a European Disk which will not work in US players. Since we had already opened it,we could not return it. I admit I may be at fault here, but I never considered that there would be a European version. Very disappointed."
1,None of the same charm as seasons 1 and 2....,"Upon viewing the 1st episode, it was pretty evident as to how different the content of this show was. The 1st and 2nd seasons contained relevant material that made ""Metalocalypse"" original- fresh ideas, direction, hilarity, and blood & guts. As for the 3rd season, the more I watched, the more hugely disappointed I was. NO laughs. Just a whole lot of none-stop needless cussing, sex, and.....well, nothing else. There is really nothing else that can be said about this season. FAR from brilliant. The show has now run its paint with the rest of the brainless crap on tv. So long, Dethklok...."
5,hamburger time,"Metalocalypse is one of the funniest shows around. A smart and extremely funny satire of the music bussines. This season the episodes are longer (20 min) which makes them more interesting, and consequently even better. Toki, Nathan, Swisgaard and Pickles are great, but the show has only one real star. If there is any justice, William Murderface will go down as one of this centuries' greatest comic creations."
4,A Really Good Season,"If you are a fan of the show, odds are that you will like season three of Metalocalypse. There were a lot of times that I really laughed hard and some of the funniest scenes of the series happens in this season. It definitely is a different spin to the series since it very rarely mentions the Illuminati, but they are still there. Instead, this season does focus on character developement and shows a lot about Pickles, Toki and Skwisgaar's childhood past. It's a great season, but the biggest downfall is that the band doesn't play on every episode like they did in the previous two season. So, you don't get an awesome Metal song every story. That's the reason I give this season a four."
5,Amazingly good show!,"Somehow Metalocalypse has gotten even better in the it's third season. Funnier, more story-driven, with even better music than the first two seasons. Brendon Small is a genius."
5,Dragon Keepers,"Dear Mr.Goldwell I really like your book alot. It's very intresting. My favorite character was the Elfin because he was the only person who could go to the gate with the dragons. The words were so remarkable. I had to figure them out in the dictionary. I would recommend this book, because It got my interest in it.I learned that some books can turn out to be fantastic!!From Myshawn Bryant11 years oldPS266, Glen Oaks New York"
1,Don't bother buying this one,"Apart from the incredible illustrations in the book, it wasn't worth buying. I won't allow my child to read this book."
1,disappointing - poorly written - couldn't keep reading,"I love dragon sci-fi/fantasy so I picked this up when it was offered as a freebie and started it with excitement. What a disappointment. The bare bones outline is interesting but the writing is pathetic. I wouldn't want a grade school child to be exposed to this type of sentence structure. I had to give up on it and pick up other promising e-books instead. Written at the reading level of a third grader or lower.Examples:""Lady Oer had been preparing for a long time to find out where the Valley of Dragons was engrossed in devising a scheme to learn of its whereabouts""""She disdained the family as inferior to her knowledge and power believing them to be lesser mortals to her she tossed her head at their entreaties.""If this kindle version has already been extensively edited, I'm really glad I didn't see the initial copy!"
2,A nice try but.....,"here we have another example of celebrities trying to make crossovers to other genres. While Jamie's singing isnt the worst I heard, but you have to wonder if she didnt have all the buzz of ""The Sopranos"", would she have goten a record deal? Probably not. Her voice doesnt stand out at all (sounds rather plain if you ask me), and falls flat most of the time. I suggest you tape any songs you like, or download them, because chances are you wont be happy with the entire album."
3,WASN'T THAT BAD WASN'T THAT GOOD EITHER !!!!!,"This CD is an okay CD, nothing special, nothing interesting, quite boring, but a little of this and a little of that added together. In my opinion, it's okay if you buy this CD because if you a big fan of Jamie, but if you like not a fan and want to find a good CD, this CD would not be the best choice. If you are an adult Celine Dion, Faith Hill would fit you more, but if you are teenager I would suggest Evanescence, Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton"
2,She's no Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm a huge Sopranos fan so I was curious enough to download the free samples --- Madonna mia! If you're a very young person (teenage and below, say) you might like this stuff. It's awful, but no more so than that Britney Spears or any of those other interchangeable teeny-bopper ""singers"" children seem to like. It's very typical of that kind of boring, soulless stuff. If you have more grown-up tastes, keep watching the Sopranos and stay away from this kid's records. Try listening to Helen Forrest or Ella Fitzgerald and wonder what the heck ever happened to popular music."
3,Well...,"Let me say first that I am a really big fan of Jamie-Lynn. She has an absolutely gorgeous voice. She's not a screecher (Christina Aguilera) or a groaner (Britney Spears). Her voice is soothing and crystal clear, which is the reason I gave her debut effort 3 stars. I like the first two songs because they are fun to dance to and a couple of the ballads are pretty. But..most of the songs are rather monotonous and the lyrics are kind of blah. Overall not a bad debut effort, but hopefully her next release will have some more solid material."
2,slightly disapointed,"I just recieved the radio today, it arrived on time and in good conditon. It's bigger than I thought it would be, but it's still a nice clean look. I bought it specifically because I needed a radio and we recieved a gift certificate for Amazon as a gift. I don't usually order electronics online, and I won't in the future either. The reception for the radio isn't all that good. The speakers sound a little tinny and get static when they are turned up, as if they have been used for years. As for the ipod dock, it doesn't charge my husbands ipod. We think it might be because it's an old generation ipod, but we don't know. The remote only controls the CD player, I knew it wouldn't work on the ipod, but I thought it would at least control the tuner.I don't listen to many CD's so basically I just lost 80$ and I could have gone to Target, spent 30 and gotten something just as good, or better.Not worth 80 dollars."
3,HEADS UP!!!!!!,"HEADS UP!!! THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT LITTLE MUSIC MACHINE...HOWEVER IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PHILLIPS GOGEAR MP3 PLAYER, SPECIFICALLY MODEL# SA9200/17. THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS MISLEADING IN THIS INFO. WE PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WOULD WORK BUT IT DOESN'T!!!!!!!! WE LEARNED THIS AFTER CONTACTING THE PHILIPS CUSTOMER SERVICE TECHS."
2,pretty cheap,"im tired of this thing. it doesnt get loud enough, the light is too bright so i have to unplug it at night, the remote is crap, the ipod dock is pointless, the cd player turns off randomly, and the tuner is horrible and does not stay on the station im trying to listen to. i decided to give it to my mom and now she is annoyed by it. look elsewhere and get a real shelf system."
2,MCM-108DB,The product did not charge the ipod nor did remote function keys operate ipod as specified.
4,Tight junt,This is dat early genuine Memphis sound dat was hard to come by when it came out and even harder now. I have an og cd if any1 interested hit my email.
4,THE WORLD HAS BEEN SLIPPIN!!!!!! ON THE MEMPH TOWN..,I AM A M-TOWN FAN TO THE FULLEST.. I THOUGHT GANGSTA PAT WAS A LAME BACK IN THE DAYS!! HE HAD A JERRI CURL.. BUT NOW I SEE HIS TALENT.. MEMPH TOWN STOP ALL THE EGO TRIPPIN!! MR KING OF MEMPHIS (DJ PAUL) IT IS TO MUCH TALENT BEING WASTED!! BE A MAN A KING WITCH YOU ARE AND SPREAD THE LOVE TO ALL YOU SUBJECTS..
4,This is a tight album!,"This is one of the best, I think, albums that Gangsa Pat has put together. I love cruzing to it down Central when I am visiting familia in New Mexico. This is OUR music!!!!"
4,blinking eyes,"i am enjoying the reading, and mr. parker is making me think about where i stand on the subject. a good read"
4,A great read but where is the bibliography?,"Parker presents a very plausible theory that seems to explain the great increase of species in the Cambrian explosion. In fact, it is so well-presented (much like Darwin included overwhelming arguments and examples in Origin of Species) that you are tempted to repeat Huxley and say that it is so obvious, why didn't I think of that?Like other reviewers, I cannot comprehend the absence of a bibliography. With one, I would have rated the book 5 stars."
5,Car Maintenance,Bought this book for my daughter to help her maintain her car. Everyone who drives should buy this type of book for thier model of car they are driving
2,"No More Molly,Please!","When I first started to read this book,I was sure it was going to be fantastic,but slowly it dwindled into something more and more boring.It is about a 14 year old girl named Molly whose parents are divorcing,plus she is being sent away to boarding school."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars...,"IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK! I made many attempts to get it to work, including following the directions in some of these reviews that claim makes it work... but nothing got this software to work. Just putting it in my computer slows it up so bad that it freezes, then I can't do anything until I control+alt+delete the program or just turn off my computer altogether. What a load of crap. I just can't believe this was released to the public."
4,Problem Error Possible Solution for Friends Trivia,"I don't generally write reviews. My main reason for writing is to let other Friends fans know of the way that I was able to get this software to work. When you insert the DVD, browse to and then right click on the setup.exe file, click on properties, and then go to the compatibility tab. Select the check box and change it to Windows ME/98 compatibility.I don't know if this will work for everyone, but I was having problems like other people, and after I did this, everything worked great. I do have burning software installed, and am running XP.As far as the actual review of the software, if you are a Friends fan, and you have a partner who is as enthusiastic about it as you are, then you will love this software. My wife and I play it constantly and have a blast every time. There aren't many options on different gameplay modes, which is why I knocked a star off, but it does what it's supposed to do. Give you a fun Friends trivia session."
2,Very disappointed,"Like many others customers, I am very disappointed with this product. It seems to have malfunction or something else, because to play properly, I have to re-insert the disc 9 or 10 times! It's such a shame... I am probably the biggest Friends fan in France :)) and I hoped that this software could last a little bit more my favorite TV show..."
1,TOTALLY UNSATISFIED,I am extremely unhappy with this product. It is defective. I gave it as a Christmas gift to my daughter and was very disappointed to learn that it does not work.
1,Don't buy this software!,"What was Warner thinking? Installed it on my kids computer...tried to run it...it said I was using a copied disk?? Huh? So I did a 3 gig+ full install and guess what, you still need the disk in the drive. It still said I was using a copied disk, which I wasn't. So I called...you know, the 20 min. wait thing. I was told it was because of the copy protection within the program detecting a burning program on my computer...such as Nero, etc...and you have to uninstall any type of burning program to run this crap. It will not let you run it if you have some capability to copy it?? Let me get this straight, they expect you to reconfigure your computer so you can run this thing? They are dictating what other programs you have on your computer? Are they insane? Hollywood out of control. I finally got the program to run and guess what, it is poor software anyway...not worth anyone's time. Leave this one on the shelf. junk."
4,I loved it EXCEPT.....,"I thought it should also have a single player with levels. The single player mode isn't great but multiplayer is fun for a group of friends that love FRIENDS!! If you are looking to play alone, get the used at a discount. :) *******A True FRIENDS Fan!!"
1,Could Not Use,"I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
2,Could be better,"We played this in a team format with another couple. We tried the ""buzz in"" version; we won't do that again. The ""buzz in"" keys were the ""s"" and the ""c"", a little close together considering there is a whole keyboard to use.In order to score a point a player has to be ""in control""; meaning that they won the last question. If a question is answered incorrectly the player loses a point. This sort of scoring caused the game to last over 3 hours!Some of the trivia is ridiculous (What color shirt was Ross wearing in the last clip?), other questions made us think. Overall this is nothing more than a mediocre board game with some video clips; but what do you expect for the price of a board game. I think we will try the ""Scene It - Friends Addition"" instead."
2,definitely dissapointed,I was very excited to get this game but it ended up being a huge dissapointment. I'm a Friends fanatic and it got old very quickly... the game is really short first of all.. and there's no real point to it. I wouldn't buy it if i were you.
1,3 Tries. Won't Work,I purchased 3 copies of Friends: The One With All the Trivia. None of them would work. All 3 came from different sources and all of the disks showed read errors. They must have been bad from the manufacturer. My computer and DVDRW work fine with other CDs and DVDs.
5,Financial Aid for Veterans,"These scholarships and grants are very specific to the type of service you were a part of and time periods. Some are for the service members themselves; others are financial aid for dependents. Whether you qualify will also be specific to what kind of degree program you are interested in. Don't expect to find a ""full ride."" It is a very tedious task to find what you are looking for, but good to have the information available."
2,Not Helpful,"The book is difficult to use, and somewhat disorganized. Putting the scholarships in alphabetical order instead of by service, branch or state increases the difficulty of accessing the information. Including a CD-ROM would have helped."
2,"Don't blame the Seller, but...","I'm pretty sure the Seller doesn't know this, but the first cassette has a fatal flaw. The person annunciating the English word, and the person speaking the Korean equivalent are out of sync. The Korean speaker is annunciating word 86 (for example) while the English speaker has spoken word 85. So the Korean speaker is one behind the list sequence. You can throw the that cssette away, but the other is in-sync.If that weren't enough, the Korean speaker speaks too fast, and says the Korean word, or phrase, only once.But, if you buy it used, it's still worth the money.Dan"
2,Not bad,"This book (really a pamphlet with approximately 20 pages of words) is good if one wants to learn vocabulary. The strength of this program is that it focuses on words and not phrases or dialogue like most programs. When you think about it it is useless to learn phrases without knowing vocabulary, you may know what you are trying to say, but you will be clueless when a native speaker responds to you in their language, if you don't know vocabulary. The problem I have with this program is that the words are given in random order which makes in more difficult to retain. In addition, when a word is given it is not repeated, so you have to rewind the tape if you wish to hear the word again. All in all it is not a bad program and the price is right."
5,Delightful and realistic Virtual Aquarium,"I received this as a gift and I am very impressed with the quality compared to other PC screen-saver aquariums I have seen. You may also see it used as a demo in stores that sell PCs. The fish are highly realistic in the way they move as well as the 3D graphics. Watching fish move in and out of the gently waving tentacles of a sea anemone is almost as fascinating as the real thing. There is also a FishCam mode from a fish POV. You can select different aquariums and then add one or more fish from a selection of about 40. The choice of aquarium effects the choice of fish. Additional fish can be purchased online.If you have an older PC this program may not work well for you. The requirements include ""3D graphics acceleration and support for DirectX 8.1"". Also, I have not found a way to display the aquarium across multiple monitors. It would be great to see fish swim from one monitor over to the other."
1,A Whale of a Waste of Money,"This is one of the biggest rip offs of a software program I have ever purchased. I've only given it one star because I don't have the option of NO stars.I bought this for my son's Intel Mac, only problem is it doesn't work on a Intel Mac. Too bad it doesn't say that anywhere on the box or in the online advertising. I installed it on my G5 and cannot believe how slow it works and of what poor quality the fish are. They don't even look close to realistic. If you want more realistic looking fish, get Serene Screne's Marine Aquarium. Far superior to this poor excuse of a screensaver!"
2,Fish Tale,"Aquazone is good, but I've found that Serene Scene is a better product. Aquazone is not as realistic as Serene Scene and that is what I was looking for. The realism of fish in an aquarium. If I could go back I would buy Serene Scene instead."
1,"Complicated Drivers, no support","I was using seimens speedstream wireless card and that worked perfectly. Got this card and the signal does not register and am unable to connect to DLink router.There is no faq or support on hawkings website. I got drivers from hawkings website, even those do not work (and there are 2 sets available).I got another card (belkin) and that worked perfectly. But I am stuck with Hawkings card too as I cut upc for rebate.Do yourself favour, do not buy Hawking Tech products and save yourself some time."
1,No stars would be more just,"They won't install on two of my PC's, an older IBM and a recent HP. The box ships with printed instructions to install the card and then the drivers. They also ship with a disk that sends instructions not to install the card until you have loaded the new drivers, and to discard the first disk. XP won't take the driver off of either disk, or from the download. Their web site support is just the driver downloads, no FAQ, no email. Pathetic! In contrast, I sent an email at 11:30 Friday night to D-Link tech support, and had a response (that worked!) by 8:00 am Saturday. These will soon be replaced with D-Link products."
1,A Hawking Lemon Product,I didn't know others had problems with this product! I also never got it to work and Hawking Tech's all had different reasons-my motherboard was outdated for it etc.. I have a new and great mobo and it still won't work. AND I AM TRYING TO USE IT ON ANOTHER HAWKING PRODUCT! (Outdoor wi-fi antenna which works great with a Belkins router) I use several Hawking products. The Hi-Gain antennas are great but this product is junk. I am going back to Hawking support after finding the reviews here! P.S.-Other drivers given by Hawking support did not work either. The other reviewer was corrext-instructions on the box differ from instructions on the cd-and neither work.
2,Drops out occassionally & mysteriously starts functioning,"For the most part, this works for me. In my current apartment, the antennae has a direct line of sight to the wireless router about 20 feet away and I find that occassionally my wireless connection stops functioning. No amount of rebooting my computer, router or modem worked, so I suspect it's the card or the driver. I also encountered similar problems as one of the other reviewers, where I tried downloading a supposedly more up-to-date driver from their website and ended up not getting any functionality at all."
1,Worst piece of junk,Generally I don't write reviews. But this is so bad that I am compelled to write my first review. Just bad product. Just 10 feet away from the wireless router - no obstructions and still has dropped connections every 5 min. Tried everything under the sun. Driving me nuts. Need to buy another card now. Stay away.
5,Necessary Laptop Accessory!,"This is a fantastic, lightweight notebook cooler. It's easy to take around and very quiet! I'm using my laptop right now, and had to check to make sure I had it on, because I couldn't hear anything!It's sleek and looks great under my 13"" HP Pavilion DV4t.You can adjust how high or low you want the fans to run (I always keep it on high, I don't really see the point in keeping it low). There's also an off/on button.It has and extra USB port so you don't lose one for the sake of keeping your notebook cool! I also like that it has a slight tilt to it, which makes it better for typing.Happy with this purchase all around!"
2,"ok, but not worth the price","This product is not worth the price, it doesn't work any better than the ones at target.Cons-My Macbook Pro constantly slides off the cooler, this can be fixed by using some velcro to attach the laptop to the cooler.-it's pretty big for what it does.Pros-cools down my laptop-I guess it's kinda comfortable when using it on your lap.Bottom Line: I saw something that is cheaper, smaller, and more comfortable at target. I've also used cheap $20 coolers before, it works just as good as this one."
5,Great Cooler,"I have the larger version of this cooler (the NC2000) and my girlfriend wanted a cooler for her laptop so I got her this.Works great just like my larger one. It's quiet and actually works. The design is nice in that the airflow is distributed rather evenly, compared to other coolers that have high flow near the fan and no flow anywhere else.However, as with any laptop cooler, this only works up to a certain extent. To properly cool the laptop you must get air inside and blowing past the heatsinks, not the external body of the laptop. To solve this, you can open it up and cut out a sheet of paper or foam that has holes specifically placed by your laptop's cooling vents, and this will help direct the airflow into those areas. This will much more effectively help cool your laptop, and this is one of the few cooler designs that actually allow this."
5,impressed,"This laptop cooling pad is amazing. I used a couple of cooling pads before and each ended up only a failure. This one is very quiet when it is working; indeed it was too quiet I had to check if it was on. Plus, it cools my laptop very nicely. I like how it looks too. $50 might have been a little bit of hustle for a cooling pad, but it was worth it - and still is!"
1,Not quiet at all.,"I initially bought the 1500 model. It was not quiet at all. So Zalman USA offered a replacement. They shipped me this NC 1000 silver model. The NC 1000 is not quiet either. Even at a distance of 1 meter, I can clearly hear the fan sound at the slowest fan speed setting. The noise is not high pitched metallic sound, but it is annoying. I cannot believe the decibel figure they advertise. I use this product in an ordinary studio, not in an anechoic chamber. The fans do not seem to be so quiet, and it seems that there is amplification of the fan noise at certain frequency range due to enclosure effect. I gave up returning it again, because I myself have to pay the return shipping cost again. If you want to buy this cooler, please check the ""refund"" (not replacement) condition of the seller."
4,Does its job well,"This is a very well made product, worth the money. The on-off button, fan speed control, the extra USB port are all very nice features. With its thick all aluminum top with ventilation holes, it cools well without the fans turned on. Fans are silent when running."
3,Laptop cooler,"This is the second notebook cooler that I have purchased - the first was a flat model that cost about half the price and works just great. The main difference between that one and this is the typing angle the unit puts your laptop into. This one has a ""speed control"" - not needed - If you have to have the ""top of the line"" (or just pay extra for everything you buy) then buy this item. If not then purchase a cheaper model and prop it up with a couple of pink erasers for the typing angle. One last thing - the fans are just as loud as my cheaper unit - at whatever ""speed"" you set it at. Hope this helps."
5,Johnny Cash Show,This is a great collection of Johnny Cash's Show and all of the great entertainers he was so fortunate to work with. We will watch it over and over and share it with our friends when they are at our house. If you are a Cash fan you must add this to your collection!
5,The Man in Black is The Man,For all Johnny Cash fans this is a must have.I have heard that orher volumes will be released.Lets all hope so.
1,Bad DVDs,"We got two copies of this DVD and the sound did not work properly on either one. At $25.99, Amazon decided to refund only $12.99. Would not recommend!!"
4,Great vintage,This is wonderful footage of the old Johnny Cash show with all kinds of stars singing with him. A trip down memory lane!
3,"outstanding music, but why all the talking before???","I can't say anything about the music, with Bob Dylan and Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles and so many legends... And although I find it equally great to have memories from former Tenessee Two and Kris Kristofferson (yet another legend), I would have appreciate to be able to jump to performances without having the big speeches... Especially when you buy that kind of DVD knowing it will always be near your player.It would have been greatly appreciated to have the performances and the banters on differents chapters."
4,When TV was worth watching.,Johnny Cash is excellent. Most of the guests are enjoyable. Mother Maybelle is amazing. Kristofferson does a great job of narrating it. Some of the details about the guests are interesting and amusing. Linda Ronstadt was 35 years ahead of her time in the wardrobe department. It's too bad we can't get quality shows like this on TV today. This DVD set brought back a lot of good memories and is definitely a good value.
5,Musical History,"The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is a fascinating look at the history of American popular music. Louis Armstrong plays ""Blue Yodel #9,"" just as he did on Jimmie Rodgers' 1930 recording. James Taylor makes his network television debut on the show. June Carter made Linda Ronstadt put on bloomers before she was allowed to sit onstage next to Johnny in her short skirt. Mother Maybelle Carter, Pete Seegar, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, George Jones--they're all there, and more. Master picker Norman Blake was a guitarist in the house band, as was the incredible Carl Perkins. Perkins' performance of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" is incredible, and ""Matchbox"" with Perkins, Clapton, and Cash recalls the glory days of Sun Studios in Memphis.If you are a music lover, you will not be disappointed by this DVD set. There is something for everyone."
5,Christmas gift a hit!,This was a gift for my mother who has said that it was even better than she thought it would be.
1,Here We Go Again,"I'm so tired of these ""Best Of"" compilations. I've been waiting almost 40 years to see these shows and, once again, they get chopped up. Why can't somebody (finally) get it right and issue complete variety series in there entirety? Geez, it only lasted two years! You could probably fit every episode in one or two boxed sets with double-sided DVDs, which so many companies do nowadays. Instead, we get all complete seasons of Friends when all one needs to do is turn on the TV at any given time of the day and see the same episodes in syndication - as bad as seeing I Love Lucy continuously until we have the complete dialogs memorized! Shame on you Columbia/Legacy for doing this. It's like a teaser of something we'll never have. This may be the ""best"" for you but not for me and, therefore, I will not be purchasing it."
1,Did not receive a 2 DVD set,We ordered the 2 dvd set with total run time of 230 min. We received one DVD with total run time of 83 min. Retuned it.
3,Was it just my copy or what?,"On Disc 2 chapters 1 and 2 the menu doesn't work. Nothing on menu is selectable. I guess ""Next"" was default selected even though it wasn't highlighted was the only way I got to see menu for chapter 2. Good material though even though it is a hassle to jump to favorites by indexing and fast forward,reverse.***UPDATE 9/25/2007 *** Got a replacment today and it is doing the same thing. Studio put out a bad product. At least they did in the first shipment. Who knows about the later shipments. Sent Sony/Legacy a nasty-gram about it."
5,The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show,My mum loved Johnny Cash and The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show was one of the few I could find. She loved it and watches it alot!!
5,G,The DVD exceeded our expecatations and is a wonderful purchase that will be watched over and over again. We will probably put it on when we have company and parties.
5,Outstanding quality pack from the outstanding man in black,"This is Johnny at his best with some of the biggest names in music. It's fine stuff and includes some superb people at their very peak, not to mention Mr Cash himself on good form.Considering what you get here, this is a must buy. I've watched it several times already and some songs way more than that. A great DVD.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,Talk about nostalgia!!!,This the BEST!!I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and this is just like watching him 'for real'Anyone who is a fan of JC/country music will love this DVD--it takes you back in time to the days when country music was more than contrified rock music and TV was worth watching...and is priced just right.
5,The Best Of The Johnny Cash Show,Outstanding! The best of Johnny Cash at his best! Great guests and duets! You'll love it! Well worth the money! Still shines even after all these years!
5,Cash well spent,True to Johnny Cash's style he gives his guests time to sing full versions of their songs. Unlike so many others that cut their guests to a couple verses with no instrumental part. Some songs the instrumental has a great deal to do with the songs success and Cash lets guests play full versions. Excellent Video and well worth the Cash
5,Johnny Cash,"JC never worried about ""crossing the line"" (he'd walk the line) when it came to musical guests. This anthology is a time-capsule of the most interesting music of the late 60's and early 70's. Watch, listen, learn."
5,Enjoyed the contents - menu let's you select what you want,My husband & I enjoy hearing Johnny Cash sing & the other classic country singers. This DVD allowed listening to just the songs through it's menu so we skipped the dialogue.
4,Great DVD - Highly recommended - Great music,"This is a great DVD and shows some very old (almost historical)footage. I highly recommend this to all music fans, not just country music fans. Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, Eric Clapton, Derek & the Dominoes, Statler Brothers, Bob Dylan, June Carter Cash and many many more are on this great DVD. If nothing else, you get to see about a 3 second snippet of footage with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Eric Clapton on their guitars!!!!!"
1,A disappointed fan.,This video did not play all the way through to the end so I could not see all of the artists that are listed on the box. Buy it somewhere else.
1,No Food For Thought Here,"It's annoying when people claim to know what they are talking about...but really have no idea what they are talking about. This is some of the worst writing I have enocuntered in a long time, and I hope the author can prepare food better than he can compose a sentence, because my feeling is he'd have a lot of cases of food poisoning and sick stomachs. This could have been better, there is something here...perhaps in the hands of a master chef, yes; in this case, the souffle is undercooked."
2,"Too Concise, Dry and Dull","This is unfortunately, a 'too' concise biography of Debussy which never really gives a sense of what the man was like, or the impact of his music on the twentieth century. A disappointment after a good experience with another book in the Cambridge music series."
2,too short for such a major musical figure,"It is unfortunate that there is not more available on Debussy in English. This book, at only 167 pages (including pictures) hardly does him justice. Because it is so short, the book jumps from topic to topic at an alarming pace, hardly giving any details. The author's convoluted writing style does not help matters either. Unlike many other musical (or otherwise) biographies I've read, this one did not leave me satisfied. Hopefully the out-of-print book department will have something more complete on Debussy."
4,Worthwhile but expensive reading,"I've been exploring the Balanced Scorecard model since 2003 and I found this book a cogent and succinct addition to some good material available on the model (e.g., the Paul Niven books and Dave Ulrich's Results-Based Leadership).Dr. Rampersad moves from the organisation's Balanced Scorecard towards developing a personal scorecard. There is considerable material on competence assessment and development, which will be useful to people interested in this aspect of strengthening organisational competitiveness.On the whole, a good read and recommended. The only reason for four stars is the high price for a relatively unknown author. In my opinion, this book should be priced in the $mid-20s."
5,Ein integriertes Managementsystem,"Äußerst systematisch aufgebaut, entwickelt Hubert Rampersad in einer stimulierenden und praxisnahen Sprache ein integriertes Managementsystem auf der gedanklichen Basis mehrerer erfolgreicher und äußerst aktueller Managementkonzepte, wie dem der Balanced Scorecard, dem des Total Quality Managements, des Wissens-, Kompetenz- und Performancemangements, des Changemanagements sowie dem der lernenden Organisation."" --Professor Dr. Christian Schuchardt, Professor für BWL und Internationales Management an der School of International Business der Hochschule Bremen"
5,A tool kit for executives,"""A tool kit for executives who would aspire to run high performing learning organisations--managing to be at the same time immensely practical, current, ethical and integrated in its coverage of a large and challenging territory."" --Professor Nigel Nicholson, Chairman, Organisational Behaviour Subject Area and Director, Centre for Organisational Research, London Business School"
1,Expensive book from an unknown writer,Expensive book from an unknown person. This has to be the world's #1 most boring book ever. It is not engaging at all and has the nerve to be expensive.The comprehension level of the book is not the greatest. The book lacks interpretation.(Extremely)positive reviews are probably from writer himself. All reviews are written onthe same date(aug 13)???!!. How sad!
4,They Keep Getting Better,"This is her third album and it just takes the foundation started with the others and builds on it. Diane not only is the artist, but along with her husband/ partner in music, Geoff Sather, produced this disc in their home studio. I enjoyed the whole disc, but in particular Prickly Pine, With My Eyes Closed and Say It Ain't So. The songs (and the others) showcase her beautiful voice and her talent with the guitar.In back supporting her are Geoff along with many others helping along the way. Bottom line, if you are a fan of the singer-songwriter genre buy this disc. And if you haven't gotten the first two yet, get them also."
5,Collecting is addictive!,"A great game at a great price. The ships are very durable, but just be careful while assembling them. Be slow and gentle so the tabs do not break off when inserting them into the slots. Once assembled, the ships are very strong. This is a neat game for boys, and a cool collectible for anyone who likes the old sailing ships."
4,Great little reference,"A classic on 'no fail' tricks. Solid introduction to magic beyond typical child-like introductions. Some tricks are quite, quite good."
4,good starting point,"This was one of the first books I read when I started my research, and later my writing, on the Rev War 30 years ago. It is a good starting point. I also recommend Spirit of '76 by Commager and Morris, and similar books full of first hand accounts that bring the participants' stories to life. - Gregory Edgar"
4,good book,This book was had lots of examples of his patients in it and the different types. Steven Levenkron explained anorexia very simply yet well. It is good for both readers who know about the disorder and people who are new to it. It is very comprehensive and breaks up the aspects of anorexia into different sections that are easier to manage.
1,Why not try leaving the bigger then life ego behind?,"Well, going by the words written inside the book, maybe you are a skilled healer. Yet, truth has we know is often stranger then fiction. Ha, that's the catch. With a super sized ego, therapy somehow gets swept under the rug. Something to think about, what is more imperative? Healing those brave souls, who put there trust in your hands. No, I think not. Let's go with the flashier option. Having a name that is known, being the nations premier expert. Pity fame wins out, over soul and consience. Steven Levenkron, looks like you have done it again."
3,"It was okay, not great","It had some good info into the personal experiences Densmore had with the Doors. However, Densmore wrote quite a bit about himself which I found boring, when he stuck to Morrison it was informative."
3,An interesting but sad book,"I would recommend this book to Doors fans but caution that you may find it depressing because Densmore intentionally or unintentionally shows the extent to which Morrison was alone and isolated. The book details the way in which the people commercially benefitting from Morrison's talents, looks et al did nothing to help him even when he was out of control and obviously at a minimum needed to be given time off from performing. It seems no-one attempted to reach out to Jim Morrison the alcoholic because as he said himself he had become the ""prince of industry"" too many people's egos and mortgages depended on him. It is a really depressing read full of Densmores insecurities, Densmore was a great drummer in a great band. However he does himself a disservice with a lot of the petty, immature commentary in this book. but hey take a look for yourself. It seems ironic that here is Densmore cashing in again...hey Elvis you weren't alone."
2,"Too little, too late....","John Densmore has always looked miserable in all the pictures and videos I have seen of him, always seemed annoyed and maybe even a little jealous of Jim's talent and charm. In this book he sounded whiny and seemed to try and make up for not appreciating Jim Morrison while he was alive and how without Jim, The Doors would not have been able to do what they did. I lost respect for John when he sued the remaining Doors choosing to be the voice of Jim from the grave...The book was not an interesting read at all-just sour grapes, and too little too late in my opinion."
3,Memoir from a disgruntled band member,"John Densmore is for lack of a better description, an iconic drummer. Morrison and Densmore had a difficult working relationship and the takeaway is that Densmore enjoyed the Doors, but at a price; that is - he had to work with the difficulties of a multi-faceted, alcohol fueled/abusive Morrison and all the baggage that Morrison brought to the table as their fame and workload increased. This made for a much less than pleasing relationship."
4,the truth and nothing but the truth... well almost,"After reading so many things glorifying Jim Morrison, which believe me, I still do, it is refreshing to read someone admit how arrogant and cruel Jim could be. Especially when it is from one of his peers. I still believe Jim was a tortured soul and when looked at behind the glass of that which was Jim himself, it was easy to misinterpret him. But in order to get a true feel for the real Jim you have to look at all sides of the spectrum, and in this book you are faced with the very brusque truths let on by the drummer and friend behind(literally) Jim; John Densmore."
1,densmore needs professional help,"This man was being eaten alive by his jealously of Morrison and this thread runs through the whole book. This was the second book I read about The Doors and I picked up on this immediately. I had to force myself to finish it as dealing with Densmore's insecuritites and paranoia were almost unbearable. If you're a die hard Doors fan you need to read this but if you want to find out about the other 3 Doors and not just Densmore, then go elsewhere."
2,repetitive account of a cowardly man's addiction to an addic,"I'm a huge Doors fan and I respect John as a drummer/musician, but this book is just too much. Historically, it seems accurate and informative but I can't understand why John felt the need to crucify himself over and over again in this book. I think the final two chapters are unnecessary, almost the babblings of a committed man. I understand he has been through hell in his life, but we all must deal with our own personal hells. There's not enough celebration about the Doors - he almost gets there a few times, but the music is all powerful, not the words or the individuals. The most annoying parts come as John repeats his thoughts about how the group had few confrontations about Jim Morrison's ever-increasing problems. John sounds timid and cowardly during these moments. It taints the whole thing. I like the history, but not the Densmore depths and his attempts at analysis and theory! Sorry John, better luck with the novel."
2,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!,"Everyone who has rated this book very highly, obviously has no idea what they're talking about. Sure, if one would love to read about John Densmore and his life, and his thoughts, and his family, his dreams, and learn everything there is to know about John Densmore, and everything he has done in his entire life, well then, open up this book. He's obviously not a fan of Jim Morrison, so why would he ever write a book about him. However, the book is mainly about John Densmore. So, if you would like to waste some time, knock yourself out."
3,from behind the drums,"John gives his viewpoint from behind the drums. This book came out much before Ray's book which created a name-calling match between the two. It is the peotry and the music that we love the Doors. The name-calling can be done behind closed doors. Anyway , John book is good to read as one more viewpoint. But he does seem bitter at times. I personally think John was very umcomfortable with Jim's personality."
4,"HOW ABOUT IT, ROBBY?",BOTH DENSMORE'S AND MANZAREK'S BOOKS WERE INTERESTING. I AM NOW WAITING FOR ROBBY KRIEGER'S! WOULD LIKE HIS PERSPECTIVE.
4,Kay London,This is a good read for all Doors fans. Some unseen photos of the band and the gorgeous Jim Morrison. I have read many books on The Doors and this gives a different perspective on their relationship and life in LA in the sixties.
2,yawn..,i was very disappointed in this read..boring all about Densmore..do not recommend..if you want to read a good book check out Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek or Angels Dance and Angels Die
3,A good read but,"This was a good read but not particularly juicy or revealing. Densmore dwells often on his guilt at not being able to stop Morrison's downward spiral. I wasn't sure from reading the book whether Desmore and Morrison were just bandmates or also friends. At times they seemed somewhat close but at others, they seemed to have little more than a working relationship in a band.The author seems like a gentle, introspective soul. At times it seemed like he was a bit out of the loop as to what his bandmates were up to.I enjoyed the glimpses into his life with Jim--e.g. Jim pulling Ray's hair in the car or Jim swallowing a quarter--and Densmore's own life--his relationships and music.I do wonder about the tension between Densmore and Manzarek, as this wasn't really mentioned. I guess I'll be reading ""Light My Fire"" next for Ray's perspective."
4,The drummer speaks,"This is Doors drummer, John Densmore's account of life with and without Jim Morrison. His feelings and relationship with Morrison from the beginning of the Doors to the end of Morrison's life. He never holds back his thoughts on Morrison and the Doors as a whole. A wonderful read."
5,HOT DAMN THIS BOOK IS GOOD,THIS BOOK WAS SO SO SO SO GOOD I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN FOR ONE SECOND.THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING I HAVE TO SAY IS WHO EDITED THAT BOOK THEIR WERE SO MANY MISTAKES.
3,Good Read,"This book was pretty good, I thought Dutch could have been more gangsta when it came to Frank."
5,This is how a book should be written!,"Dutch written by Kwame Teague is raw, gritty and a definite page turner. The main character Dutch is ruthless and a force to be reckoned with. You either love him or hate him. Kwame paints a vivid picture on how serious & cutthroat the streets can really be. At the end of the book they only thing I could say is ""damn!"" Kwame has a promising future as an author and I love forward to his reading his future works. He has a fan for life!"
4,GOOD FICTION,"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. AT FIRST I DIDNT REALLY LIKE IT, BUT WHEN I GOT A HOLD OF PART 2 I READ IT IN LESS THAN ONE DAY. CANT WAIT FOR PART 3"
5,Teri made another classic,"I think that this book was better than True 2 the Game. It was so gutter and I was intrigued with Dutch's character from the beginning. He was all about making money and he could'nt wait until he got to the top. He played the game right, he was not a small time type a' Ni**a. I loved it and I would recommend it to anybody. I actually read this book and the sequel right after the other so now I have to go comment on Dutch 2."
3,What's with all the hype?,I really wanted to like this book based on all the good reviews. The reviews are misleading the characters are undeveloped and flat. I'm not sure why this book has so many good reviews but I will not be reading the rest of the trilogy.
4,Good Book...I felt like I was there....,"This is the 4th book that I have read by Terri Woods and I enjoy the twists that she adds to the plots. This book really held my interest because I wanted to know what was going to happen next and where the book's main character Dutch was going to wind up. I must admit, Ms. Woods didn't disappoint. I am getting ready to order the next book in the series."
4,Love this trio of books,"I first became curious of this book when a good friend of mine was reading it. After she read it, I read it, and then another one of our girlfriends read it. So far I have read part 1 and 2 and I enjoyed both. I am looking forward to reading three.Cleverly written and enjoyable - we all fell in love with the main character Dutch. Great set of books if you like urban fiction."
5,Dutch,I really enjoy this Author's pen game.... Reading this title I felt as if I was there seeing the scenes play out right before my eyes.... The story had so many real elements to it being that it was based out of my hometown... I definitely recommend this title...
4,alright,"I am a avid book reader and every one that read this book prop it up. when I read it, it was not all everyone said it would be dutch did some very rutless things and yeah he was like scarface,but better but i just was not really feeling this book and the excerpt that was in the book is the sequel, Method to the Madess I did not get that,who the hell is he? But i will buy that too because it is by teri woods and she is one of my favorites but i would say borrow this book before you think about buying it."
4,Borrow it from a friend,"Well I must say this book is just like the rest of the street novels. But Dutch was a little crazier and the only reason I purchased this book because it was based on my city (Newark, NJ) and I support everything representing Newark. But like I said if you want to read this novel borrow it from a friend because its just like the rest of them street novels."
4,A little bit of both.......,I struggled to get through Dutch because it lacked the drama filled intensity that I'm use to when reading novel. The rave reviews for Dutch had my expectations really high so needless to say once I got into the book I was a bit let down. However I finished it and I'm glad I did because towards the end the book really becomes a page turner & now I'm pretty curious about Dutch II & III (When is the Dutch II coming out anyway?) Dutch gets 4 stars from me because it's simply a great story that's starts off slow.
4,Gritty and Real,"Teri Woods is on top of her game; she does not bore you with rambling narrative. She hooks you from the start of this action-packed novel.Dutch tells the story of how a young brother got in the game during childhood. Possessing street smarts along with superior intelligence, Dutch singlehandedly devised an intricate plan to rise up from the bottom of the food chain to become a major player. A force to be reckoned with, Dutch swiftly became one of the ""big boys.""Dutch's character is depicted as being the strong and silent type as well as being devastatingly handsome. It was easy to love this character even though he'd resort to murder at the blink of an eye.His mother could be blamed for his notion of surving the game at all costs because she raised him to have that attitude and was unforgiving when he made a mistake, slipped up and got knocked.Without giving away too much of this edge-of-your-seat thriller, I'll suffice it to say I can't wait for the second part of this trilogy."
4,Gangsta!,"Dutch was so gangsta in this book. Now, not to glorify violence, but if you are looking to read a good street novel, Dutch should do it. The book starts off with Dutch in a court room, and the book explains how and why he became so feared and how he came up in the game. Dutch does some ruthless cold hearted crap in this book. It's wrong, but it'll make you say damn that's gangsta! It's a very good read, if you like drug filled, mobb type stories."
2,Not Terri Woods....,"I thought that ""DUTCH"" was a total slump. I hated that book! It was only about 2 good parts in the story out of a million. I was really disappointed that Terri Woods would publish such thing."
2,Not Teri Woods' BEST!,I am glad that this was not the first book I read of Teri's because I would never read another. This book was just ok. True to the Game was one of my favorite books and I expected the writing style and the enthusiasm to be the same in Dutch. From page one in the court house the book bored me. Then I continued to read it because I knew it had to get better but it did not. It was just and ok read. Nothing at all exciting but the ending.
2,where is Dutch lll,Where is Dutch lll??? Why is it so hard 2 find??? I hear and read about lots of people talking bout it but where is it? And this Kwame dude where is he? Is he really in jail or is this just gossip to make the book more interesting. I was just hoping that part lll would be a little better. If dude really wrote these books why doesn't he at least have a web site like everyone else. Oh he is in jail but so was Wahida Clark. People please let go of the Kwame tale. And Teri could u get started with part lll. Cause I got a feeling there's some bootlegging going on.
2,Dutch: The First of a Trilogy,"This Book was Horrible, a waste of my money to be honest.In the beginning it started off so slow and boring and it didn't pick up till towards the last three chapters in the book.At this point im pissed off that I had to wait this long to get to the good part. Teri Wood is a good writer but this just wasn't his best work. Its so bad that your reading and you don't even remember what you read in the previous chapters because your so bored. I know that he came out with a second part to this book, but I will not be purchasing it because if I didn't like this one then I proably won't like the new one being that I don't remember what the hell happened."
5,Bananas!!!,This book was so hot that it's ridiculous. I was floored. It was like Scareface but to the next level. Definitely a must read.
4,STR8 Gangsta,"""Now thats what the @%&$ I call a chain reaction!"" So hood, so ganasta! A must read! Str8 up!"
4,a good record to have in your collection,"well, i pulled this record out of the rubble a few weeks ago. i'm so amazed as to how good it is. how it still sounds awesome after all these years. this record is easily liked by many people; straight-edge, hardcore, punk, old-school/new-school. ""trust"" and the title track are among the best 7 seconds songs ever made. great album to show to your lil bro or sis. the only reason i can't give this album a prefect is b/c the last [approx.] 1/3 of the album is not as fun-mosh-sing as the first half."
2,not so simple to follow instructions,"Although the designs in this book are very beautiful, even at the intermediate skill level I find the instructions sorely lacking. Not only does each pattern leave one wondering what they are supposed to do (evidently a lot of creativity is needed in understanding what the author intends) there are no instructions whatsoever on how to make the straps. So, if you want the strap to be symmetrical, recommend using another one of your beading books that has full instructions, or, for those more creative than I am just figure it out on your own.Not a book for beginners by any stretch of the imagination."
2,Fantastic,"The whole book is fantastic, great charts, beautiful necklaces. I statred making the rose designs the same day I got the book."
2,Time for a break,"When looking for a followup to PowerPlay (1982), I was excited to see this one and bought it immediately. I haven't listened to since 1985 and could go easily another 15 years. Having said that I have heard ""This could be the right one"" occaisionally and remember that it is somewhat enjoyable - a slight saving grace.Myles put out some solo material in '87 as I recall, and there was more Wine in the early '90's, but I had long since abandoned this outfit."
4,good and thorough but reliable?,"very good and very thorough, with much information on most popular topics of neurosurgery; however, some of the statistical data as percentages of symptoms, outcome and complication rates lack reference. are these data from a single paper or from a compilation done by the author?"
5,very good book,"this book is a portable sumary of all neurosurgery resident should know, thanks for this,very complete , best wishes, good price, update"
4,A Must But....,"As a practitioner of Neurosurgery this book provides a very good fast review of fundamental facts. I have been bought this book since the first ed. Very useful until fifth edition.Unfortunately I have a great but for this last edition:My HANDBOOK OF NEUROSURGERY bought with the help of Amazon has not the page 257, instead page 157 is displayed.For an editorial house as Thieme this is a great failure!The Author does not have a reposition for page 257 in his web page www.grgraphics.com.My advice is, look for another option until a pristine new edition of this book."
5,Nouvelle interpretation,"J'ai ete ebloui par la lecture de l'Eloge des femmes mures, mqis le recueil d'essais de Vizinczey m'a emerveille davantage. J'y ai trouve une definition de la litterature des plus judicieuses. ""Il y a fondamentalement deux sortes de litterature. L'une vous aide a comprendre, l'autre vous aide a oublier; la premiere vous aide a devenir une personne et un citoyen libre, l'autre aide les gens a vous manipuler. L'une s'apparente a l'astronomie, l'autre a l'astrologie."" Quelqu'un l'avait-il jamais mieux exprimé? La critique brillante et sauvage de nos coqueluches litteraires m'a fait bien rire. L'auteur sait evoquer la joie unique que l'on ressent a la lecture d'un bon livre. C'est difficile de croire aue l'auteur est etranger. Je n'avais pas lu Stendhal depuis le lycee et l'essai de Vizinczey m'a fait realise combien j'avais manqué! J'ai recommence la lecture de le Rouge et le Noir et c'est bien plus drole que cela ne l'etait a 16 ans."
5,An excellent look at the Bush presidency,"from a different angle. In essence what Dr. Lifton does is to put the Bush administration on the psychiatrist's couch and probe into the psyche of Bush, his cronies, and like-minded ideological extremists. One conclusion that can be readily drawn is that psychologically there is minimal distinction between Bush and his neo-con and Christian extremist cronies and those extremists from other religious and ethnic groups (say, such as the Likudites and Osama bin Ladin & Al Qaida). Lifton does a decent job not only of describing in layman's terms the psychological underpinnings of these extremists, but goes on to show the destructive dynamic that often exists between competing groups of extremists. A must read."
1,came broken,"this box is beautiful, but it came broken. the spiing ballerina and music never worked. i made the company aware, and they said they were out of stock. that was a bummer because i wanted to give to my niece for easter. now i have a box."
2,Only So-So,"Slightly disappointed in jewely box, I know I didn't pay alot for it, but I did read reviews before I purchased and they were pretty good, so I went ahead and purchased it. On receiving it, I feel it is not a good as I thought it would be, it is basically cardboard covered in pink foil with ballerinas on it,the ballerina inside is so-so, her face is a little askew, the music quality is good. I would recommend a different one."
3,Cute and Simple,"My granddaughter loved it and walked around with it all day.Pros: small and easily to be handled by a pre schoolerattractive designeasy to windCons: just a basic box with a pop up ballerinadon't know how it will stand up over time, as just made of simple materialsnot a quality box for good value for what it is"
4,music box...so so,"this particular music box wasnt quality controlled because the shiny plastic covering was peeling off of the box itself. well i thought it was a protective plastic that u were supposed to peel off so i began to peel it and it was too late. that was supposed 2b permanent. so i finished removing it. i was angry !! if i knew it was a permanent plastic, i wouldve taken clear elmers glue and swabbed it and glued it back on neatly. now the box can be easily scratched. but the music part was good. and i made sure i HOT GLUED the insides that can be pulled out by little fingers."
5,Great jewelry box!,"Read the other reviews before purchasing this for my 5 yr old granddaughter for her birthday and I was not disappointed! It was beautiful and she absolutely loved it. She kept wanting to watch the twirling ballerina. I felt it was very good quality, especially for the money. The ballerina and music were great; the artwork on the front and top was beautiful - but most of all her eyes just lit up when she opened it. Priceless!"
1,Top came off,"I got this as a Christmas present for my niece. When I received it in the mail. I opened up the package and the whole topjust came off. It is the worst, cheapest looking jewerly box I have ever brought and I am sure to never buy from this seller again!!!"
5,Best Gift Ever,"This is possibly the best gift I have ever bought. I gave it to a four-year-old for her birthday in 2010. Two years later, it is just beginning to break. In other words, after two years of being the ultimate toy (carted around absolutely EVERYWHERE as the treasure chest for all of her favorite things) the ballerina still dances. The spring has been pulled, twanged, and mobbed at slumber parties, but this box has outlasted it all. It has been an easy fix whenever the kids have managed to go too far. I honestly thought that I was getting a cheap-enough-to-replace music box, but this has surpassed my highest hopes. I'm thrilled that I bought it!The pink on the box is very reflective, so expect to see something incredibly shiny.The girl I gave it to is blonde, and she was pleased that the ballerina is blonde as well."
5,Excellent for little girls,"I have been buying these for birthday presents for my daughter's 1st grade friends. I bought her one for Xmas too. It has become her signature gift and is adored and classmates (girls) look forward to inviting her to their birthdays. It is of good quality, endures the affectionate attention of 7 y.o. And is packaged nicely. I would not keep buying them, about 1 dozen to date, otherwise."
5,nicely done,A welcome change from a childish box. Will still be used and appreciated as child gets older. Child loved it.
4,A Good Collection,"As a Smokey Robinson & The Miracles DVD, this collection of their great songs is good and well mastered. This DVD collection could have been a great had most of Smokey Robinson's solo songs (e.g. Let Me be the Clock, One Heartbeat, etc.), been included in the DVD. The DVD shows the very young Smokey and the original members of the Miracles. This DVD is a good reflection of one of the greatest soul groups of all time - Smokey Robinson & The Miracles."
4,Good Motown History,"As far as historical information on Motown, this is the better of 3 that I've purchased. The live performances were pretty good, too."
5,Old memories,"It was wonderful looking at old footage of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. The interview of three of the group members gave me more introspect into their individual experiences, the writers of specific songs and the ""days of Motown."""
2,Dissapointing Song Quality,"Before I start, I'll just say I'm a big Smokey fan, and was hoping for better than this. I only wanted the songs, not the chat, so if you want the chat reviewed, read other's comments.I bought this based upon the reviews here, but was disappointed with the product. Similar products for Supremes, Four Tops, Temptations bt the same company were better, but this one had BAD versions of nearly all songs.2 EXAMPLESBeing with You - clarinet player(?) at the beginning hits such awful wrong notes so bad it makes you cringe, and he doesn't get much better as it goes on. There are much better videos of this song out there, including the later re-release.Ooh Baby Baby - clear video, but not a good rendition of the song, Shindig and other renditions much better.Tears of a Clown and Tracks of my tears the only good versions on the DVD.Shame, it could have been so much better."
4,smokey robinson-review 1963-1987,"I really enjoyed seeing smokey and the other members recall their heyday. My family and I have followed smokey and the group throughout their stellar careers. I had hoped for more performances, maybe there will be other videos that showcase this tremenous group and other smokey solo performances."
2,No Five Stars From Me!!!,"If anyone rates this with 4 and 5 stars, they must be thinking about the conversations between Smokey and the other two Miracles! This DVD is nothing but a ""talking interview."" I expected to see Smokey and the Miracles in action! Too much talking -- not enough singing and dancing. If you want to see an interview throughout the whole DVD, then this is the DVD for you."
2,Foretrex cable with limited ability.,"I have 2x Foretrex 201 units, where i have to share the data between them regularly. The units were shiped without any software, but i found EasyGPS (freeware) to work great with the units, and with keeping a back-up on the pc. I can now even download waypoints from the web into my Foretrex 201's. I have now upgraded to a new laptop, without a serial port, and i am dissipointed not to find a usb replacement cable from the manufacturer. The GPS units though, are working great."
3,New technology needed for PC interface,"If the PC connection would be updated to USB (my computer does not even have a serial connection), they could even add the ability to use the USB power to recharge the Forerunner. That would be Really useful!"
5,Good accessorie for the garmin,Almost a must if you want to interface with the computer and track you progress. Works as expected. Haven't used it for sometime now.
1,waste,This item was a waste for me. It does not even fit my Cpu. I think it should come with an adapter with a female end and a male end to be compatable with all Cpu's
1,Mislabeled,"The pant is great; bought a pair at a local retailer. The size of this product from my online purchase is 3-4 inches off of the tag size. The seller confirmed that her entire stock of XXL was off by 4 inches in the waist. This product has the potential to be great; however, the sizing is a big issue when purchasing online."
2,A little pretention goes a long ways,"This is my first book by Edmund White and probably my last. His stories are marginally entertaining & I suppose the they succeed on some level, but they so strewn with French phrases that can only be known by a French speaker or a Francophile that one begins to wonder who Edmund is trying to impress? The same goes for his conquests, always trying to impress with his prowess and his internationalism. In short, if you can stomach pretention at a party you may be able to stomach this. I can't, there are too many good things to read."
2,pseudoscience,"This book has an interesting subject. the way it's presented though is totally not scientific. New facts that he states are not logically reasoned and the reader simply has to follow his blank statements. Leaving manyy questions open, this cannot be the basis of anything, rather just a few thoughts of substance focussed thinking."
4,Comfy,"This boot is comfortable right out of the box. Its even a bit roomy. So, wearing a thick sock with it is no problem at all. I'ts also a very nice looking boot that can be worn with dressy pants or jeans. For this price, it is a very good value!"
5,Wonderful author and book,"All of Chieko Okazaki's books are wonderful. She talks about finding the important spiritual side of life, as well as contributing to community and doing the best we can. She is uplifting and smart, and very inspirational. I highly recommend all of her books."
1,Enck is Eckkkk!,"I'm sorry, but I don't agree with these rave reviews. I've read all of Enck's books, just hoping that they'll get better, but so far they have all disappointed me. The plot starts off good, but then falls flat, there are numerous typographical errors and inconsistencies within the characters. I think that Mr. Enck's ideas are good, he just needs more help in developing them (and a better proofreader)."
3,Tell Me Your Name,"This book was ok, I thought it would be predictable but it wasnt. It took me a while to get thru it but I just finished reading it... I guess there might be a sequel to this... I will read it from the library.."
3,What a letdown at the end?!,"I was lovin' the whole book until about the last 25 pages, then I was like, ""what the hell!"" It had a dumb ending but throughout the whole book it was decent and suspenseful!It was a good read but when you get to the ending, don't say I didn't warn you!!"
2,"Necessity, But Poorly Designed","This is a necessity and I'd recommend it, but suggest you be VERY careful with it. Had mine for a couple months before it started switching modes and turning off and on if you bend the cable to a certain point. I've taken good care of it, too. I don't recall ever tugging it abruptly from the remote. I had to buy another one because I need it for my workouts when I have it in a belt CD case in the gym."
2,maybe i just got a bad one but...,"build was ok. functionality was good.but everytime i plugged my headphones into the remote, i got a good deal of static and background noise that i didnt get when i plugged directly into my nomad. that ruins my music listening experience and so, i returned mine.anyone else get this problem? if not, maybe ill give it another try."
1,Screamably bad,"I waited 8 months for this product, paid list price for it through the company, and it broke in two weeks. Not just BROKE, mind you, but the cable that connected the unit to the player snapped because it was so flimsy. This of course rendered the whole thing useless. I was not a very happy camper. I didn't even ask for a replacement -- I asked for my money back from Creative. Even that was a problem, but that was a whole other story!"
4,Key Kleen Swab cleaners,These are perfect for cleaning the keyboard on your computer. I've used them at work and could not find them in stores. Service was very quick.
2,The Aviator!!!! Smith and Wesson,"The Watch caught my eye with the cunning nite glow in all the advertisements!But to my surprise when I received my watch I put it in total darkness to see the awesome briteness of it, but it was'nt there!!! Wow the advertisement showed a super brite glowing watch and all I was holding was a very dimly lit watch that was hard to make out what I was seeing? Well I called a manufacturer of the watch and they said your eye's have to adjust to it before the glow comes out!!! NICE!!!A friend of mine ordered the Tracer military tritium Watch and we did a comparison ""WOW"" I guess you get What you pay for! His Watch was Ten times as bright and as soon as you put in darkness it was there for the eyes to see with no waiting for eye to adjust!!! So Buyers Be Aware of this!!!It is a very Nice watch but takes time to see in darkness!"
4,Tritium watch,Perfect if you need a watch you can read in the middle of the night. If you have presbyopia you can still read it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 111 12 13 14 15
4,Easy to use effective,"I use this splitter for sales shows, where I run powerpoint demos and screen shots of software on multiple monitors. I am not a techy,...this was pretty much plug and play. No problems."
1,Good For A Laugh,"Upon first listening to this album I was convinced that it was some sort of joke. Melodramatic and overbearing, Enrapture bludgeons the listener with a sonic sludge that is neither engaging nor enjoyable. The songs on Enrapture are not much to begin with, but the over the top production and performance, make the album laughable. This record is not worth the time or the money even as a punchline. Goths and Geeks alike will do themselves a favor by avoiding this band altogether."
3,Not so wonderful as I expected.,"I read some wonderful reviews of this book, and I purchased it with high hopes. Though I found several of the stories (specifically, the titular work, What She left Me) to be interesting and provocative, I was disappointed with the book as a whole. It was very uneven, and for every high point there were long sections full of dull, predictable prose. All in all, an uninspiring, if occasionally rewarding, collection."
5,The light shines through.,"This collection of stories combines uncommon craft with uncommon insight. The opening of the title story reminds me of one of Janet Fish's remarkable paintings of glassware. That is, while you might think the topic is glassware--or bar ware--the topic is really the light (of the protagonist) bending, twisting, transforming, and still shining through."
4,hold no punches,"While I too loved the highlight stories listed in other reviews, I found ""Whole Numbers of Families"" and ""Crooks"" to be strong as well. In a way her stories remind me of the writer Marisa Silver's portrayals of life in L.A., in that Doenges creates a landscape of hidden lives in modern America, often with glimpses of Chicago. Odin is a great character; all of her main characters are believable and intimately atriculated. I hope she writes more; as a 20 year old queer person I was really happy to find this book. Doenges takes the time to make her people complicated but really gay, telling stories that are just plain interesting. If you are Doenges and you are reading this, thanks for making these characters and talking about these lives. Even if they are slant lives, they are important. It's also nice to feel like you're not alone, reading them."
1,The Secret Connection Between Gladwell and LeGault,"This book was clearly retrofitted as a rebuttal to Blink as part of a marketing ploy. It is, in fact, a rant riding the coat tails of a bestseller. To add insult to injury, it is poorly organized and frustrating to read. Shame on you Mr. LeGault, and shame on your publisher. I await the publication of ""St!nk""---an expose on how fickle the publishing world is. It will have nothing to do with the substance of Think or Blink, will promise to reveal all sorts of secrets about Malcolm Gladwell and Michael LeGault, and will, instead, be a book about weapons of mass destruction. If you read this review because of its title, you know exactly how I felt after reading your book."
1,Feeble attempt at skewering a much better book...,"I can't for the life of me understand why a ""rebuttal"" book should sport a cover so much like its intended target. That said, throwing rocks at a better, more rounded and robust piece like Gladwell's while somehow turning it into a right-wing rant may imply a kind of talent. This author is gifted with the ability to completely misread even the most basic assertions of Blink, and has found ways to present his mangled interpretations in some of the most empty language I've read in a long time. A badly conceived and written book...if you still want to bother reading it, go ahead. You'll wish you read Gladwell's book instead. Too bad this is billed as a rebuttal, because it's clearly out of its league in its attempts to criticize Blink. Did this author even READ Blink?? Made me wonder.One star is too many. Save your money. There are so many good books out there waiting for you!"
2,Not the book it claims to be,"Marketed as a rationalists response to Gladwell's ""Blink"", LeGault spends precious little time explaining the books thesis and inordinate time presenting his personal political viewpoints. For example, the author claims that the vast majority of scientists disagree with the threat of global warming, and he accuses those that believe in the problem of falling prey to poor thinking again, and again, and again. The author also feels that radical feminism is a serious threat to American culture (I still haven't met one of these mysterious radical feminists). In general, the author seems to think that simply being a contrarian makes one rational. If you think like he does, then you are being logical. LeGault's real thesis appears to be an attempt to conflate rationalism with conservativism. Still, if you can wade through the author's obvious biases, there are a few thoughtful passages that offer a valuable counter-point to ""Blink""."
1,A pointless rant,"I purchased the book blink and thought that this would be the perfect book for providing a counter balance, but despite persisting (which has been very hard from page 100) eventually made it to page 160 have given up with trying to go any further.Michael LeGault use to be a columnist for the Washington Times and the book seems to be a collection of what someone would put in columns then padded out to be more in book format. That is someones opinions on everything from ADHD, computers etc.The first chapter when he tried to discredit Blink, if feel he failed miserably, Blinked taked about experts in the field having the ""blink"" ability, Michael just implied it to everything.A am sorry to say that I have gotten borded with his oppinions (albeit I agreee with most of them) as it does not provide any guidance on how to think etc.Unfortunalty I have to give it 1 star just to rate it I would prefer to give it none."
1,Think...my way or the highway!,"LeGault purports to offer a book on how to critically think and a retort to Gladwell's ""Blink"". He apparently did not read Blink because he completely missed what Gladwell was trying to say about ""reading minds."" Further, many of LeGault's case studies are without references, i.e. an unnamed glass factory, and for one reference he goes so far as to reference himself. If you're looking for a book on how NOT to think critically this is it. Anyone who knows how critically think can ""tear this book"" apart with little effort. Oh yeah! See if you can figure out which award this ""award winning"" writer received--Good Luck!"
1,the book is a right-wing rant,"This is a ""bandwagon"" book. It's written by a right-winger who sets up Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Blink"" as a political target. The author deliberately distorts Gladwell's book in order to set it up as a phony straw-man target.The inappropriately titled ""Think!"" is an utterly worthless book."
3,Made me think,"I read Blink in a few hours and thought it was an entertaining read. It took me a week to wade through Think. I had to refer to my dictionary frequently and reread some paragraphs over and over to glean their meaning. I now have a list of books he referenced that I intend to read. I cancelled my Netflix membership after he guilted me into admitting that I watch too much television. Sure, maybe LeGault took a free ride on Blink's coattails, took unfair potshots at liberals, favored studies that supported his position, and frequently annoyed me with his pomposity--but at least I closed the book with plenty to think about."
2,reads okay... sounds terrible,"As a frequent listener to audio books I was very displeased with the reading of this book by the author. The producer really should have stepped in and asked Mr. LeGault to have the CD version read by a professional, as the author was unable to verbally parse his own prose. The impact was twofold: first, that the language content became very difficult to interpret; second, that the author undermined his own thesis/argument by insisting that an amateur, from-the-cuff performance was somehow instilled with greater value than that of a trained voiceover artist."
1,Blink,I didn't get my book after place order more than one month. I order four books in the same order. Till now only get three books. I send email to both Amazon and the provider two week ago. But both parties didn't reply may email. I wonder how they can ignore my mail like this.
2,Very repetitive.,"I bought this book as the companion piece to Blink for my wife. Before she could get to it, I tried reading it. I found the initial story to be awesome (about the auto glass manufacturer), but after that it went downhill. I found Legault to say the same thing over and over but in a different way. I made it through the first 40 pages and couldn't go any farther. However, if you can wade through his ability to say the same thing five different ways, he does say some pretty profound things (don't worry, my wife shared them with me, that's how I know) which is why I gave it a two star rating."
1,Complete waste of time reading this book,This book is poorly organized and contains no useful information. Unless you want to understand why people should have commonsense there is no reason to get this book.
2,Think!,"Purchased this on CD to listen to during my long daily commute. The author was the narrarator. Wish his voice had been more dynamic. A bit monotone and dry and it didn't help with the message he was trying to get across. The CD wasn't what I had hoped for and although I listened to the entire message, I won't listen to it again as I have other books on tape."
1,Critical thinkers beware - critical thinking not much in evidence!,"Unreadable. Amazing that a book about the unassailable importance of critical thinking can evince so little of it and be so poorly written.Entirely polemical with no reasoned argument. Paragraphs end with dire predictions for the end of the world or ""a theme tht will be revisited and analyzed throughut this book."" After being appalled for the first 40 pages I gave him 3 more chances. On page 49 he blew it with the paragraph opener: ""Let's consider the importance of critical and creative thinking to something damn important: our jobs.""This is so pathetic that it has prompted me to write my first review to save you up to $25. Redeeming value: I'm giving this to my high-schooler to show her how not to construct an argument."
2,Think? Shame!,"What a shame! I was so hoping for some deep insight into the current state of ""sleep"" that permeates our culture. Instead I found ranting more irritable than Michael Moore's. In between the rants were sections of analysis with nothing new to report. This book is not worth precious reading-time. Perhaps, the author's comment on his need to make money explains its existence. It's certainly not a worthy comment on ""Blink!""."
1,More Right-Wing Dogmatist Blather,"Why does the right-wing attack the person instead of offering reasonings about the issue? The author takes to task several ""left"" writers and is dogmatic without offering much in the way of proof. Just believe me because I said so (like their leader, GW Bush).I did like the chapter on ""stress,"" but it didn't save the book. Too bad the far right-wing (not the moderates) are so negative about anything even centrist."
1,Painful attempt at a free ride,"I bought this after having gone through both ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"", both by Malcom Gladwell.Was expecting something similar I guess, however was greatly dissappointed.Found that many of the observations made in Blink seemed to me to be missrepresented in this work.LeGault seems to imply that in Blink, Gladwell is saying, dont worry, you don't have to microanalyse things, just go with your intuition.I however felt that in Blink, Gladwell was saying that there are times when people can become so familiar with their field of expertise that their intuition can be incredibly perceptive. He also gives good examples of where intuition can be dangerously wrong.Found my faith in this author damaged very early in the piece.I do not recommend this book."
2,Too much irrelevant information,"While this book is good at raising the question of how we might better use critical thinking to make better decisions, the author tries to cover too many other issues as a way to justify his position. Tearing down the book 'Blink', straying into greenhouse warming, and reiterating how poorly policitians deal with issues does little to further the case for the need for critical thinking. I wish he had concentrated on how to integrate our critical thinking and intuitive thinking brains. As it is, he comes across as just another radical looking only for data that supports his premise while conveniently ignoring other data from legitimate sources."
5,Please Don't Ignore This Great Album,"Dave Edmunds is a truly great artist, and I've never understood why he is so ignored by the public. It's true that he made his greatest albums in the seventies. ""Repeat When Necessary"" is my favorite. But this surprisingly great album is the best one he's made since then. Don't miss it!"
4,Great resours,"This book is a great resource but it is not for casual reading in my opinion. Just a warning.It is basically a compilation of property during the middle ages just after the Great Death, or the Black Plague, for tax purposes so you can just imagine."
4,Expanded version?,"I grew up reading an earlier edition of this title, closely after publication in 1985. This edition was published in 1988, and when I recently purchased it I was pleased to see that the columns and recipes were as I remembered them. How can you not smile to see a ""Rainbow Dinner"" in the same book with a dinner comprised of ""Food in a Cloud?"" Mr Sicherman's humor has withstood the test of time well, and while the recipes can be a tad unhealthy (reference the cake with over a pound of butter in it, I believe in the first chapter), they are a joy to prepare.My only criticism comes from the absence of the ""Torte and Retorte"" sections that originally appeared in the first edition. Chronicling the author's love of French pastry and a friendly argument with a fellow writer who prefers the Sachertorte and Eastern European desserts, they were a joy to read. I hope to find them again when I repurchase the older book."
5,Great Product,"Anything that works with HP printers (HP4 Plus)is a very compatible product. The drivers had to be installed via Control Panel, System, Device Manager. Works great!"
2,Didnt work with my scanprisa 640P,"I bought it with great hopes that it will help use my old Acer 640P scanner with Windows. The card was recognised by windows7 and was listed as LPT1 port in device manager. But the scanner when connected thro that was not. I tried even XP mode inside windows7 without success. Could not find a suitable driver for the scanner to work in win7. The scanner works with a dedicated XP PC alright but not in win7. Either I have to replace my scanner or have a dedicated laptop with XP and a parallel port, if i wish to use the scanner as it is."
1,Did not work,Item did not work in a new (10/2012) server (Lenovo TS430) running Windows Server 2008 R2. Did not specifically have drivers for 2008 R2. CD did have drivers for Windows Server 2003. Actually interfered with the bus on the motherboard causing other devices to fail. Used another board from another manufacturer and it worked fine.
3,There are far better guides,"I bought this guidebook and some others. What this has is great pictures, and some highlights. If all you need is something to start your planning, this is good. But if you want a guidebook that recommends lots of hotels, restaurants, and other outings, look elsewhere as well."
2,SADLY LACKING,"After using the very thorough NG traveler guides for Boston and New York, I found this one to be a disappointment. Many of the attractions in Hawaii are overrated and not as large in scale as the prospective tourist is lead to believe. It was also disappointing to find megabuck admission fees at locations where there was no warning in the book. Of course everywhere you turn around in Hawaii, someone wants to relieve you of your money. There also appears to be a huge auto theft and theft from auto problem in Hawaii. Everywhere you turn you are warned not to leave valuables in your car. National Geographic has and should do better than this guide."
1,Do Not Buy This Product!!!!,"WARNING!!! Don't buy this shoulder rest. I bought the same one, except it was a full size (4/4), and the feet broke when I was only trying to put it on my violin!! This product is cheaply made and the plastic is not suited for heavy practicing for people who want to improve. It is for beginnners who will only use it a few times a week. Don't be fooled by the cheap price and the clean look. It doesn't even have enough cushining, it is styrofoam, instead of a real chushion with velvet topping, as in the new shoulder rest I am buying now from amazon."
3,a little disappointed,"The Battery came in on time and it was at a very reasonable price but it was not the original and it didn't perform as expected I would have paid a little extra to have an original delivered to me, I am pretty sure it still would have been a lot cheaper than the $70.00 Sprint wanted for one of them, they are ridiculous."
5,Great deal,The item arrived quickly and I have not had a problem with it. Will definitely order from company again.
3,Somewhat dissappointed,"I was pretty excited to receive the Oklahoma team mat, as it was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. He's a huge Sooners fan. Colors weren't as vibrant at all, as depicted on the piture. Dissappointed!"
1,Bait and switch,"Seller advertises NEC brand, and then ships generic ""OEM Equivalent"". If I wanted a cheap ripoff bulb, I would have bought a cheap ripoff bulb for a lot less. Buyer beware."
4,Hands down besides the lyrics and the connection of kiddy,"Her song is like so cool!!! Ok it has some childish lyrics... and of course it has its connection in the Rugrats in Paris movie but its good nonetheless. I really would like to know when she sings more song. And what about the Huckapoo Solo? Raven got hers. And way more then that.( perhaps they really do have a Huckapoo solo but its not listed at Amazon) And cartoons *_* half of them are so weried, go watch some Invader Zim you want a cartoon. And then of course check out Anime. Know wonder about other countries animation... I rate this 4 songs because its a great song, nice rhytm just has kiddish lyrics. And things from Japan include J-pop this one singer called Mai Kuraki totally rocks on!!! But get this and ignore the lyrics. And yes despite bad lyrics every song has a meaning in it."
3,Ok Case but a bit too big,"For me this is just a fine case. It's a very simple case no graphic at all and it's also pretty big. However, this is the only case (for now)that can hold up to 8 games.I'm trying to find another case that can hold more games because right now I have 10 Games already but nothing can hold more than 8. Infact, the most slot numbers of the case I can find is only 6 and it's a DS Lite Duo Game Case. It's pretty good case from the outside but i havn't try it yet.However, I feel like it's a bit difficult to get the game out from the slot but when you move this case or walking while holding this case, the games inside will fall out from the slots.I'm considering buying another case which I'm positive that I won't buy this one again. It's not because this case is bad but i just like something more fancy and slim."
2,"Bulky, but keeps your games safe","I got this in white, and I was surprised at how bulky it is. They say you can store a stylis in there, but what stylus were they using? The one that came with my DS doesn't fit in the holder (too long). You can only fit it in between the DS game holder. I also wish they had it so you could store a battery (and why would you need a spare) OR a GBA game. There is a lot of wasted space, but I guess it serves its purpose of protecting games."
5,He Understands the Problems,"This book gives me great hope in the pontificate of Benedict XVI, because when you read his contribution to it, you realize that he really understands what the modern challenges to the Catholic Christian faith are and has some ideas on how to overcome them."
5,Hard-to-find cable meets the need,"I wanted to transfer files from a very old PC (running Win 98!) to a new system. The old guy could not read flash drives or external hard drives, and a serial cable was the only way to do it. It was a VERY time consuming process, but the serial cable did the trick. The StarTech cable came faster than expected, plugged right in, and got the job done."
5,Great Value if you need one,"A great value for the money. I happened to need this older style serial cable, and this one worked perfectly. Received it in a timely fashion too."
3,Casing not up to par,"Very nice set, appealing to the eye. Pieces are unique, it has good weight to it. the Veneer on the wood is peeling after only 2 uses on mine, though. For a $50 board game, that is unacceptable."
4,An average reader,"With a very limited background in theoretical probability & statistics (as was the case for me), this book is no doubt a challenge and requires serious patience at times. However, the effort really paid off in the end, leaving me with a both intuitive and in-depth understanding of important statistical concepts. The only real frustration was that there are only answers to half of the exercises, and even these are not worked out. Having a solution manual with worked solutions to all problems would have EASILY made this a 5-star book."
3,"starts well, but later chapters lack examples and clarity","the first few chapters about probability and simple statisitcs are very clear and easy to understand. However, later chapters lose clarity and become increasingly difficult to comprehend because of a lack of examples."
1,Unbelievably expensive for the quality,"This is the kind of book that gives college textbooks a bad name. .... Let's see, that's, uh, 17 cents a page. To boot, the writing is lousy, bold-face definitions spoty and buried, and included disk basically worthless (you'd think they'd spend some of their profit on a CD that all computers can use, but they didn't...). As for the 5-star reader, how much you want to bet it's the author?"
4,Alright,"My biggest complaint is the organization. I wish all of the vocab words were at the end of the chapter.. There is a collection of words, but it doesn't include ALL of the vocab words, so you have to double-check that you got them all, and they're spread throughout the chapter, sometimes with only a few by themselves."
5,Yookoso! Continuing with Contemporary Japanese,"Great book, has important details and information about the Japanese language and their grammar. Great product for people wanting to continue learning the Japanese language."
3,A REVIEW FOR A NOTE RELEASED BOOK,"HELLO, I FOUND THIS BOOK TODAY AND FOUND I COULD NOT ORDER IT YET. IF ITS ABOUT BUDDY 1ST MUTT, ITS GOT TO BE MORE THAN GOOD. IT SEEMS MR. CLINTON IS TAKING THE DOG TO AK. I MYSELF WOULD ORDER IT, YET FIND IT ODD, THAT NO AMZSON PREVIEW IS AVAILBE. HOPE TO SEE IT AVAILBE SOON."
2,"great art, weak text","As a showcase for Bob Eggleton's fantastic (and by this I mean superb as well as fanciful) artwork of sea serpents, this book is a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately, as a serious study of these creatures it comes up short, sprinting through all manner of mythical and real-life sightings of serpents which often does not do them justice (the section on the Lake Champlain serpent, for example, is only about 200 words and doesn't even mention the Mansi photograph). The fact that the artwork bears little resemblance to reported sightings of many of these creatures doesn't help matters any. This may be of interest for those who appreciate good fantasy art and/or have a casual interest in serpents and their mythology, but for the serious student of cryptozoology, there are many other, better books around."
4,Very well done book...,"This book is all you really need to envision sea monsters all over the place.BoB Eggleton did a wonderful job on the paintings and drawings in the book,and the prose and writing was good as well.I suppose my only crit might be a little less mythos and more dinosaurs ,but thats just my tastes.As books like this go it was extremly well done over all. M"
4,Does Exactly as Advertised.,"This is a simple THC drug test very comparable to the home drug tests you can find at your drugstore but at a fraction of the cost. Although, the drugstore tests typically include a confirmatory test, it is only if there is a preliminary positive result in which you need to pay shipping for. For a quick and easy solution, this product delivers. However, you will need to use your own clean/sterile container. It arrived much faster than expected. It seems accurate when comparing to the drugstore take-home tests."
3,Easy to use but...,"If you are taking these to see if you will pass a drug test for a job, I would get something else. I bought 3 of these. I took one on day 25 and failed it. I took the test for work on day 30 and passed it though! Out of curiosity I took another one of these on day 40 and still failed. I took a 3rd test on day 50 and failed yet again. This must test to see if you have ANY level of THC in you at all, and most tests required for work have a threshold where you can pass even if you have a small amount of THC still in your system. (they do this in case you are exposed to unavoidable second hand smoke)"
4,worth a try,"give it a shot, it's worth a try. If you are wondering about a urine screening test for work, this should do the trick"
2,For Shute completists only,"I was fortunate enough to find a copy of this in my library. Had I spent $50 on it, I might have cried. This is not a novel, but a screenplay that Shute wrote to flesh out the Scandinavian backstory of his novel ""An Old Captivity"". It's impossible to say how it may have fared had it been filmed, but on paper it comes across as one of his weaker attempts. If you've read ""An Old Captivity"" there really is no reason to read this. If you have yet to read ""An Old Captivity"", you should defintely seek it out as Shute never wrote another novel like it."
1,Westlife are not all that,"Personally, I would prefer Backstreet Boys than Westlife. Why? Simply because Westlife sing the same things over and over again and practically every single on their debut CD is the same. They attempted to go for a more upbeat sound in their second album but still, they don't match up to BSB at all. This album is way too long. For those who value quantity rather than quality, then you can buy this CD but I would prefer Madonna's 10 track MUSIC album rather than this overloaded CD any day."
3,Gray roadway doesn't stay together,My son has most of his bedroom floor covered with the blue railroad track. The gray roadway track falls apart at the slightest touch and is difficult for my 4 year old son to put back together.My husband is ready to get the glue. I'm ready to hide it and bring all the wooden track from grandmas house home!
3,Betie's street,"My son has this toy. The blue tracks are terrific, but like the previous writer said, the gray tracks constantly fall down. I have even tried to take out some of the gray pieces and it stills falls. This is very frustrating to my son. I may try to glue it or take it away altogether."
4,Great espresso,"The first espresso machine received from Amazon was DOA but Amazon quickly sent out another. This second machine was DOA also so I contacted the repair company in New Jersey for instructions. They authorized me to open the machine and look for loose wires which I did and found one of the wires to the main switch was disconnected. I'm not sure if this is a quality escape from the manufacturer or happened during shipment. After reassembling the machine it worked like a champ producing great espressos and cappaccinos with excellent crema. The added burr grinder makes this machine an excellent choice for those who like freshly ground coffee. Taking the machine apart and reassembling would not be for the faint of heart but, on a mechanically inclined scale of 1 to 5, this would be about a 3."
2,"Why, Hal Leonard?","The simplified arrangements in this book gut the harmonic resonance of almost all the songs. Numbers like ""Dividing Day"" and ""The Beauty Is"" are very nearly unrecognizable.Thank you for the performance edition of ""Light in the Piazza,"" now please,release the Vocal Score, Mr. Guettel."
1,WRONG BOOK,"Reiterating Daniel F. Pinkerton ""danpink"", THIS IS NOT THE PIANO-REDUCTION SONGBOOK. This is only the libretto, dialogue only, NO MUSIC.I didn't catch danpink's proviso in the midst of these other reviews, and have spent money on a book which isn't what I wanted."
5,Winning Defense by Del Harris,"Outstanding advanced book for experienced teams, although some principles can be applied to less experienced teams.Much of the book deals with higher skilled strategies and philosophies, but gives a great foundation to playing solid defense.In this day of offense being the number one priority of most teams with many variations, it is nice to find a book that details sound defense philosophies in a straight forward manner."
2,For advanced coaches only.,I found this book much to complicated. I would recommend this for advanced coaches only. I've coached basketball for 12 years and I'm still trying to sort out the information in this book after weeks of reading.
1,It didn't help the Lakers,"I can't believe that Del Harris wrote a book about so-called ""Winning Defense"" but yet he couldn't apply those principles to coach the Lakers to the championship. I remember when Harris was the Lakers coach, LA had among the top offenses in the league, but were towards the bottom in defense. And I think it's outrageous that Harris has Nick Van Exel on the cover of that book, someone who is one of the worst defenders in the NBA. It was Phil Jackson's defensive system that brought the Lakers back to the championship, not Harris's. If you're still not convinced, here's the score: NBA Titles won as Head Coach: Phil Jackson-7, Del Harris-0. I rest my case."
5,I'm making imperfect progress,This book speaks right to the heart of an emotional woman. Finding tangible truths to use in moments of weakness is a precious gift. Thanks Lisa for another great book.
5,Awesome Book,UNGLUED! Awesome read. It was one of the best books I have ever read! A must to read. Full of references.
4,Let's get started.,Something to consider over time and go back to after reflection. Like taking a growth check up from time to time.
5,One of my favorite authors!,Lysa is one of my favorite authors. She's relevant and funny and most importantly...real. Unglued may be her best yet!
5,Re-glued!,"Lysa's wit and humor are once again matched with her ability to hit you square between the eyes and dead center in your heart! Life application with biblical principles towards dealing with raw, out of control emotions is the basis of this book. I love to read her words, as her writing makes me feel that she's got eyes into my life somehow and I'm hearing this Godly encouragement from a dear friend! Way to go Lysa, thank you!"
5,Unglued,"I love how Lysa TerKurst can be so honest about herself. This book gave a God based response to ""unglued"" moments. I really took her words to heart and have tried to apply them to my life. A must read in my world!"
1,Study,I am reading this in a Bible Study Group. This woman drives me crazy with what she comes unglued about. Trivial mundane things tick her off.If she talks one more time about how she washes her hair in stages...I might come Unglued. She doesn't come up with anything we don't know about ourselves. I think she just loves to hear herself talk.
5,Excellent read,This book gives scriptural guidelines how to deal with life when circumstances happen that are beyond our control. Gives biblical guidance that helps understand and equip us for when that unexpected encounter happens.
5,Unglued... it's unbelievable!,"I've been able to preview parts of this book, and am so excited to read the whole thing. Lysa builds out several powerful ideas dealing with issues we all struggle with. It's not just for women, but men and teens and basically anyone who suffers from coming ""unglued."" Lysa's ability to be transparent and speak from examples in her own life allow us all to completely relate to her struggles. Can't wait for others to read this message!"
5,Great author. Stellar book.,"Lysa always writes in such a way that helps you realize what you've never been able to understand about yourself before. This book is no exception. Eye-opening, challenging, and encouraging for sure. Great book if you struggle with making wise choices when faced with your emotions."
3,IT's ok,"This book is somewhat ok. I didnt get past the 4th chapter, as it became sort of boring and repetitive.This book is good for someone who really likes to read, and want to learn how to control emotions. But it only speaks about the writer's emotions rather than your own."
5,Honest,I have recommended this book to a number of my friends. Lysa's honesty and thought provoking style make this a book well worth the price and the time to read. Lysa lays her experiences out for all of us to identify with and recognize that we are not alone. She gives us viable suggestions on how to change. This is one of those books which I will read over many times.
5,Completely Relevant,"I am finding Unglued to be one of the most relevant things I've every read. We all have regrets when it comes to acting on our emotions, but through the truths of God's Word Lysa offers solutions that she is working through herself.I have heard Lysa speak twice. Few people stick out to me as being so sincere and having such an influence in my life. Her love for Jesus is inspiring and her struggles are relatable because she is open and makes herself vulnerable.This book is a blessing."
3,Unglued,"Maybe it is because I don't really identify with it, specially with the title.However, there are good points in some of the chapters that they are worth to concider."
5,Good choice,I really am happy I purchased this book for a bible study. It was great and I will always treasure it.
4,Great Author - Can't wait to read this...,I loved every book I've read by Lysa. Topics have always been practical and easy to understand and applied to my life. Can't wait to read this book!
4,Can't wait to read it,I'm so excited to read Unglued. I got to see Lysa at a Made to Crave event and her authentic and engaging communication riveted me. I'm looking forward to getting my copy!
2,Not what I was looking for,When I found this book I wasn't looking for a book about Jesus and God- the description I read did not make it clear how filled with scripture this book was. I'm sure it is wonderful if you need that in a book.
3,Unglued,We are doing a study of this book and watching the video that goes with it. The study has been helpful and the book is a good read.
2,Christian based book,"I consider myself a spiritual person, but do not follow one religion. This book has many Bible references, so if this is what you are looking for then this is a great book for you. I was expecting this to be a more scientific/ psychology based book but it wasn't. There were a few scientific mentions without specific references. Candidly, I only read half of the book because I just couldn't read it anymore. If you are looking for a book based on hard science (with proper references) I recommend Your Brian at Work or Psycho-Cybernetics.To sum up the book, quoting from the book ""Last week I literally had to stand at my kitchen counter and decide if I was going to extend grace and laugh or come completely unglued. It was choice plain and simple. And honestly, that's what this comes down to, doesn't it. A choice."" We make choice on how we wish to react to things and those choices have consequences. Do we solve things by coming unglued or remaining calm?"
5,Great book!!!,"Great book! Just what I was needing for this season of my life. Great Christian perspective of how to deal with my emotions when I'm stretched thin by the demands of being a mother, wife, friend, and worker. Love the mixture of humor when talking about serious issues."
5,Awesome,"It is a great book, we can all relate and we can get helpful tips to get better about our emotions."
4,Good Read,Overall a good read and helps in the continued healing and assurance I am not in a minority of internal chatterers as I once believed. Read it in conjunction with Boundaries
5,Hits Home,"I love this book. I sometimes think the writer might have had some personal insight into my own life. We are going to use this in our Bible study group and I cannot hardly wait for the discussion and sharing that certainly has been helpful to me. Thank you Lysa for being so ""real""."
5,Great Read,Great Read... Honest and transparent... Very believable!.. Great advice for how to deal with the raw emotions that we all face from time to time!
1,Glad I got the book,"I am still reading the book, so far is been very good and I can relate to some of the stuff the author is talking about."
2,It was just as I expected i do not care to have to write in a whole paragraph to give a good rating. Failing on Amazon's part,It was just as I expected i do not care to have to write in a whole paragraph to give a good rating. Failing on Amazon's part
3,Unglued,"It's rare when an author writes in such a way that no matter who you are, where you're at in life, or what you've been thru, there is something that God will use to take down the path He's laid our for you. It may be a small step forward or it may be a complete 180 in your life. Lisa is a gifted and deeply insightful writer connected to the heart of God."
3,A Woman of Wisdom,"Lisa has continually spoken into my life, and I know that Unglued will be a life changing and freeing read for hundreds of men and women around the country. Definitely a must-read!"
3,Great Leader and Writer,Super excited to read this book! Made to Crave totally changed my perspective on how I was viewing life. I know that this will be a challenging way to change the way we react to life's hard situations.
4,Unglued,"This was an inspiratuional well written Christian book dealing with everyone's struggles with children and confidence in raising them.Although my family is grow up (both children married,) I found Unglued to be helpful to me personally in pointing out character types."
5,Great read,Well written. Full of honesty and truth. Couldn't put it down. Lysa is real and relatable. This book will set anyone into action. She really hits it out of the park!
5,Great advice and practical,Great book. Practical application for everyday situations. I was able to read thru the book quickly and it kept my attention.
5,Really Good!,Lisa shows us how to gain perspective and control over our emotions and have a plan in place before we react. Understanding what kind of a reactor we are can help us get a grip. I really loved this book and would recommend it to anyone.
1,Can't call out unless I reset flash time every time,No good - can't make a phone call out unless I go through settings and reset flash time - every time I'm going to make a call. Don't bother with it - lucky I only paid $11.00. Just threw it out.
2,This guy blew his research,"For fans of Louis L'Amour's ""The Walking Drum"" and its historical ilk, Mr. Logan's research will set your teeth on edge. For example, he states that the term ""assasin"" came from Egypt, when in fact it came from Iran. If you know anything about popular history, avoid this book. It jarred me enough that I read half, then just read the end. While I liked his writing, I won't buy anything else of his until someone tells me it's safe to read it!"
3,The middle was a bummer.,"Maybe I expected too much. I thought the premise was intriguing, so I started reading with great interest. Then I got to the middle and I just didn't care; however, I finished the book and I must admit that it picked up at the end. I have Logan's THE PRICE OF BLOOD and will read it. Hopefully he's fixed his problems."
4,A thriller of a read,"This was my first(and his first) Chuck Logan novel. I agree with some other remarks,it did start a little slow.....but,once it got going,a great read.Quitting drinking myself a year ago,I could really ""feel"" for Harry.It can be a battle,everyday. Logan really made me feel I was up in the woods of northern Minnesota.The cast of characters,with their secrets,from their past,made for some interesting reading. With some great twist and turns,in his first novel,he will have me searching for his others."
5,A product P/N might help!!,"I ordered this product much like Wayne, without a clue. What I received was (1) box of 25, 3M #048011-25766-1, 3""(RoLoc TYPE ""S"" !!!) maroon (med cut) Scotch-Brite surfacing disc. I haven't seen a RoLoc type S in 20 years! I ordered a new 3"" type ""S"" backing pad from Amazon (409.89600686 / MSC Industrial Supply) and several more boxes of surfacing disc. They were just to cheap to pass up. I have been paying $60-75 a box for the common RoLoc's I find at auto parts & tool supply stores."
5,Well done,"I spent 7 years in the Navy, this is one of the few books that can make me look back to theose days and smile."
4,Spanish,"This is a reasonably good book for learning Spanish. I already had the CDs, so I just bought the book. I would, in general,recommend adding an audio component to learning any language-merely reading through a book won't quite do it."
2,A little disappointing....,I was hoping for much better pics and illustrations in the this book..I was really disappointed and didn't bother reading it. Bleah.
5,Great shoes!,"I bought these for my daughter, who is in her 3rd year away at the University. She really likes them, they look terrific, and she says they are comfortable and true to size. They add a bit of bling and style to her normally laid back t-shirts and jeans (normal engineering student garb)."
4,Good Tasting Nutrition Bar,"Good tasting nutrition bar. My kids prefer the Clif Brownie flavor by quite a bit but will also eat this one. For some reason, they don't care for other flavors."
3,"Great light duty driver, not for sustained production work","I purchased this brad driver to help assemble bee frames. Most hand-assembled bee frames have a small wooden bar at the top of the bee frame to hold the sheet of beeswax foundation on which the bees build their comb. After about 250 or so brads the inner piston of the driver began to lock up and not return to ready position. For those of you occasionally using this driver to hang picture frames, it's probably quite sufficient. But, for heavy duty (as in repeated, daily use), this driver is not for you--spring for a higher end model. I just purchased a Crown 110XW Brad Pusher through Amazon which, while more expensive, appears to be a much heavier duty driver. So, for my purposes, 3 stars is as much as I could muster for this driver."
4,Very useful,This is not as nice a version as some others I've seen - but it works and as a tool it can be very useful
1,Not that easy to use.,The wood you use must be soft enough for the brad to be able to penetrate. Could not use it with the wood I purchased.
4,Excellent J-Pop!,"As always an ELT CD gets replayed and replayed until you (a non-Japanese speaker) are singing along with the words....who knows what they mean! Without exception the songs on the CD are great! Also, put the CD in your iMac for a surprise high voltage ad (my version bought in Japan did anyway! (I must warn those of you that have already bought the later ELT CD ""EveryBestSingle"" that many of the songs from this album are repeated on EveryBestSingle.)"
3,Not Bad...If computerized!,"My first reference to Every Little Thing was The Best of Inuyasha, more ballad related.The guitars and synthesized music rocks and also there are solid performances for the most part but wouldn't you know the songs I like are asian titles, #5 & #6.J-Pop is related to film soundtracks. This J-pop is a nice, first effort and it's really good work which is why I give it three & 1/2 stars.Also the enclosed booklet has some cool pictures and there's some great shots of Kaori Mochida."
2,Hunh? What next?,I feel this book left me with more unanswered questioned than answers. What should I expect from the calf? How do I get it from place of purchase to the field? What do I do with the left-over animal parts from butchering? Where do I get the calf? Would it be better to buy a heifer? What are the advantages?
2,Heavy on the grain,"This book is outdated in regards to the current movement towards grass finished beef and was likely printed well before the now well known health benefits of grass finished beef. However, the author totally blows off all grass-fed beef as vastly inferior to grainfed from birth beef. The amount of grain she recommends is not only now very expensive, but also unnecessary and unhealthy. The butchering section is pretty good, however, for such a short book."
4,My 10 year-old daughter loves this.,"The watch looks great, is easy to use, and even has a cool light-up feature. In short, for the price its terrific. My daughter loves it."
1,Watch,Arrived quickly. The product advertises water proof up to 10 feet and unfortunately did not survive the shower. There is water in the face that does not seem to be evaporating. My son is terribly disappointed. The watch would have otherwise been perfect for a 12 year old.
5,AN EXCELLENT CLOCK FOR THE PRICE,BUY THIS CLOCK FOR MY DAUGHTER TEN YEARS OLD AND IT IS VERY RESISTANT AND MODERN. VERY GOOD PURCHASE
4,my son loves it!,"my young son loves it , he calls it his tar heel and panther watch! we're from north carolina"
1,Didn't Work At All,I'm not one to give 1 star reviews but this product was the worst. I bought it and it never worked. When I plugged it in the product always showed it was running off of battery power only.I contacted customer service which was the worst experience ever - I had to wait for tripplite techs to reply DAYS after I had sent my email to them. The guy 'helping' me was a waste of time and said my warranty was void because I used an extension cord. I will never buy another tripplite product as long as I live. I ended up buying an APC Smart UPS 2200 as a substitute - IT WORKS GREAT.
4,Just as the name suggests...,"Oasis, as the name suggests, sounds like it takes place in the middle of an arabian dessert. Each track blends well into the next. My massage classmates lovingly call this music ""Mosque Music"", which was no surprise. We all like it. It's very gentle and subtle throughout the entire cd. Great for massage, but may bring visions of our current standing with Iraq and other Eastern countries. So be careful with some of your clients."
1,long and boring,"This was a long, boring and dragged on. The peyote culture is something that should be kept private. This film didn't have enough sex in it either."
1,Not worth it!,"I purchased this item for our church office because it looked really pretty and sturdy. We had been using cardboard mail slots for the past several years and they were really breaking down. When I began putting the product together, I noticed that even though I put the dowels in halfway, that when you used a mallet to secure the top and bottom, the veneer popped right through the top and bottom of the product. Also, the shelves are simply resting on 1/4 inch metal dowels, so they are not secured and when you reach your hand in to get the mail out, the shelves fall down and all the mail slides out. Needless to say, I returned the product for a full refund. Amazon is amazingly easy to use for returns and refunds!"
4,Beautiful Wood But Bad Instructions,"Safco Adjustable Wood Literature OrganizerVery Disappointing because there is NO way I could have put this together myself. My husband was finally able to figure out the sheet with NO instructions in words....only pictures and a couple of gadgets that we couldn't figure out WHAT they were for!!! But anyway, we got it together finally and it looks beautiful (the medium oak) and does the job of holding all our stuff and keeping it organized so that's what counts!!!Cathy from win-edge.com"
3,Fragile Particle Board,"When fastening the top part of the box to the wooden pegs, the pegs punctured through the actual board. It doesn't look very nice now, but it works."
2,Meh-not worth it,"Fairly easy to put together - just look at the pictures. We didn't push hard to put together and the dowels popped through the veneer. Bubbles in the veneer as well. Also, there isn't room to write names. Would be nice if there was a place to put the names on the boxes. Would've been easy for the designers of the shelving unit."
2,review,"was of very poor quality. we intended to use it for time cards and various correspondence for our employees, which it did not work for but we did find another use for it."
5,A solid and useful tool,"A great tool for tapping things home that might easily become damaged by a regular steel-faced hammer or are too small to use a standard shot-filled dead blow hammer. Having the choice of the harder plastic or softer rubber striking face is really nice. Now that I have this hammer in my tool inventory, I find I reach for it frequently for such tasks as driving dowels, loose tenons and radius-topped square ebony plugs when building furniture in the Arts & Crafts style. If you are considering getting one, you already know the many ways it could come in handy, and you won't be sorry for making the investment."
1,piece of garbage,DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL .Handle was twisted 30 degrees to axis of hole. Gaps where handle goes through head. Tool is unusable as received and I will have to make a new handle to use it.
4,Excellent book for study of English Swordplay,"Although I have not yet finished studying through this book,(and it may be quite some time before I am), I have found the way that Stephen Hand had lain out his own interpretation and explanation of George Silvers material on swordplay to be both insightful and clearly explained. Having read other books on renaissance rapier that were translations from Italian, I have found the additional explanations of why Mr. Hand interprets certain actions a particular way to be extremely helpful. I would suggest this book for anyone who is interested in the works of the Sword Masters of old but who are also looking for something decidedly different from the Italian school of rapier that seems to dominate most of the current study groups these days."
3,Pointless,"This album features Warning (the Album Version), Outsider and Suffocate. Warning you can find on Green Day's Warning album and both Outsider and Suffocate you can find on the Shananigans album. I have been a HUGE Green Day fan since the age of 6 but I still wouldn't pay $12 for three songs I already own."
4,Great monitor for the price,Its a great monitor for the price. There are better ones on the market but this one is a great value. I recommend it highly.
1,Very displeased...,"I ordered two posters from Amazon at the same time, both of which came from different companies. The one was wrapped up nicely and boxed in a way that there was no damage. The order statement was tucked nicely inside with the poster. This one however...The box was obviously dented on the outside. The poster was NOT properly protected, and is now pretty banged up. The dent goes all the way down the center of the poster. On top of that, there was no order confirmation. I had to come back on to amazon to figure out the dimensions for a frame.Needless to say, I will not be ordering from this company again."
5,Excellent Reference Tool,"While it seems a bit strange to be writing a review for something like a thesaurus, I have to say that this is truly an excellent book, the finest thesaurus in my office (and as a writer, I have many). I kept this by my side during my latest project and used it constantly. A particularly interesting feature is the Word Find that appears for some entries...in addition to synonyms, the book provides a lengthy list of words that relate to the entry. (For example, when you look up ""Desert,"" you'll learn, among many, many other things, that in the desert you might see ""Phantom Rain,"" which is rain that evaporates before it hits the ground.) A neat little feature you won't find in your usual thesaurus. Overall, an excellent reference tool, and highly recommended for everyone, not just writers."
1,Can't be searched properly,"This thesaurus is not setup to be searched the way its printed counterpart can be. In the printed version, you open to the index, find the word, and reference the sublisting that best relates to its meaning. I expected to be able to do something similar with the Kindle version, but you have to search the entire book for a given word which gives you a list of completely unrelated references. Completely unrelated!!!Until the Kindle version allows you to do a ""word search"" using the brilliantly organized index reference the way you can with the printed version, this is a colossal waste of cash. Spend a little more money and buy the printed version, which is itself an invaluable addition to ones reference library."
3,"Nothing special, but good","Nothing special, but it is a good thesaurus . The roget's international thesaurus is much better- it's the sixth edition"
5,Free SF Reader,"Synonyms = Useful. It doesn't matter what color the cover is, or what edition it is really, as long as you have a big enough version to get enough words into it.The ability to look up a word and find something similar, or even something opposite, is really very handy."
3,Hard cover version was the best Thesaurus out there!,"The first edition, the hard cover version of Roget's Super Thesaurus, was my favorite resource book. When my son took it with him to college, I wanted a second copy. Imagine my dissapointment to discover that the new edition costs practically the same amount and is paperback."
4,A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE,"I've been operating with a 1974 Webster New World Thesaurus for over a year now. It was purchased at a garage sale I think and the more I needed it the less I wanted to rely on it. It didn't contain nearly the amount of words I KNEW exisited and I couldn't figure out how this book could call itself a Thesaurus when it didn't even have words like ABATE, ABACK, ABET, JEER, COMMISERATE, just to name a few. I actually did a little jump when I finally recieved my Super Thesaurus in the mail and have used it nearly everyday since. It's a blessing and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I am afraid of the spine cracking allowing pages to become loose and the print is rather tiny (small, diminutive, little, wee, puny, miniture, minute, miniscule, lilliputian, dwarf, pygmy, pint-sized, pocket-sized, teeny, itsy-bitsy, microscopic, infinitesimal) but I''m so excited to have an actual THESAURUS that I just dont care. It's worth the buy people. I PROMISE!"
5,Excellent,This Super Thesaurus far surpasses the typical thesaurus. It is chock full of words that I have never even seen listed in any other thesaurs - including slang terms & phrases. I have quite a few different ones but this Super Thesaurus is the one I find myself consistantly reaching for. I highly recommend it.
1,DON'T BUY ON KINDLE!!!!,"I only wish I would have read the one star reviews BEFORE I threw my money away on this. If you're hoping this book will work like the Kindle Dictionary, you will be EXTREMELY disappointed. It cannot be searched like a dictionary, and will not come up with the definition of the word you want; instead, it will give you a long list of the word's usage every single place in the book. An absolute WASTE on a Kindle. Maybe if you could add it to the search categories, like Dictionary, Wikipedia, Google, etc. it would be great-- if it searched for just the single entry of the word you want. But you cant', and it won't. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!"
2,Roget's Super Thesaurus,I purchased this book because I trusted Roget. I was disappointed that is was not very easy to look up a word.
1,Vortex,"The National Catholic Distorter continues to subvert a hermeneutics of continuity by reinterpreting everything from the Catechism to Papal initiatives in terms of rebellion rather than submission. There is no such thing as a ""liberal"" Catholic. You are either faithful to the Magisterium or you are not. Increasingly blogs are exposing this dying hippie dinosaur for what it is: a wolf in Cope clothing. Don't waste your money with a subscription, or endanger your soul reading it, and let it fall into silence and be forgotten as the obscure Gnostic heresy that inspired its founding. It shall be sucked into a Vortex."
1,Tired Rants,"The only thing this is good for is to see what old and dying liberals in the Church are complaining about. This will not increase your Faith or your love for God. It only has bad things to say about the Pope, Magisterial teaching, and T/traditions of the Faith. The National Catholic Register is an infinitely better choice for faithful Catholics."
5,Wonderful!!,"What a delightful piece of work this book is! I giggled my way through it. Very creative and instructive, but FUN!"
5,Great Book,I love this book. There is a great web site that gives some excellent ideas for how to make your very own vocabulary parade. This book works well with any elementary grade to teach the importance of vocabulary.
4,Intro to word study,"I chose to use this book in my introduction of word study in my 4th grade class. The children enjoyed it, and many chose to reread the book individually during their quiet read so they could take more time to look at the ""sentences"" in the illustrations. This book has become a permanent member of my classroom library."
3,Too difficult for my age group,"I bought this book because I wanted to read something related to spelling to my 2nd graded daughter, but it was too difficult for her, and made her loose interest. Maybe in 1 or 2 years will be better."
5,Miss Vocabulary,I would definately recommend this book to teachers and parents of children in at least 3rd grade. This narrative book has unique and wonderful way of introducing so many vocabulary words. You can find something new each time you read it. Also it addresses quite well dealing with embarrassment. Sage is a great tool to start a discussion about how we can deal with making mistakes in a graceful mannor. Brush up on your vocabulary today!
5,Saved by amazon.com,"After a near computer crash, the gentlemen who was rebuilding my computer did not realized that Microsoft Money had come as part of my computer software package. I was unable to re-install it with the rest of my programs. I went straight to amazon.com and found what I needed at a very reasonable price. I enjoy Microsoft Money for the purposes I use it for. It is very easy to use from check book entries to making reports. My tax prepartion has been so easy since I started using Microsoft Money."
2,Not for me,"It took me a whole month to get to the middle of the book and then I stopped reading it. I simply did not feel like reading it any more. I felt everything was so fake, too much ""made-up"" with poor taste. I did not like the father's character at all. The book was just not for me."
3,Not bad but...,"I got this nose bone and as far as what it looked like, it did look like the picture. I did feel that the diamond was hard to see, less noticeable than in the picture. Still, I was fairly pleased. When I put it in, one problem became apparent. The part of the nose bone holding the diamond was no centered on the post. I don't know if this was intentional, but it did make the nose bone sit funny in my nose. Still, I used it and wasn't unpleased. My piercing was fairly new, though, and the gauge was smaller than my piercing, so I ended up losing it after a few days.Overall, I feel the quality is there but the setting takes away from the appearance of the diamond. It is a decent piece of jewelry, but tiny for the cost."
2,The pan that came doesn't match the picture,The pan in the picture has a nice wide cutout to accommodate the plug end of the heating element. The pans which arrived did not have a sufficient cutout and I had to cut some metal out with the tin snips to allow the burner to sit flat on the stove top. I specifically ordered what I thought was going to match the photo. My stove is a GE so I assumed what I would get would work without modification. The joke was on me.
3,Aunt's review,"In black and white throughout and this turned off my nephew from the beginning - ""It's for grown-ups."" (Although I realized the older sports clips might be in black and white, and had told him so, I was surprised that parts of the video did not change to color - the box was in high color and does not state that the video is B and W.) Overall content is good with a motivational story line and a marvelous collection of the high spots that show the range of Jordan's immense talent. A great item to add to or to start a collection. Just not a good video to grab a child's interest."
3,StarTech.com 80x25mm Dual Ball Bearing Computer Case Fan with LP4 Connector FANBOX (Black),"It's a fan,it does move a lot of air but,it is extremely loud.I ended up replacing it with one that has a speed control."
5,Basic Text on the Subject,"This is a complete psychoanalytic exploration of the problem of shame by one of the chief experts in the field. This text can be a basic introduction or a thorough review, and as such there is no better."
3,I hoped for so much more,"I have recently become fasinated with everything from film's silent area, especially the queens of the screen, those remembered and many of those that have been forgotten. Whose films have been lost for all time. I was really hoping for a lot more from this book but I found it to be a dull read, and poorly written. I thought it would be a lot more meaty and it just wasn't. It was a good effort though, and I applaud the author for going into detail about actresses that have almost been forgotten."
1,price is insane!,"$35.00? really? for a kindle release? i know for a fact that amazon does not set the price for kindle books. either the publisher or the writer(if the rights have reverted back to them) decides this. i saw the title, read the description and wanted to read this book but not at that price for a kindle copy! this is a hard back price! want to sell to kindle readers? then don't charge hard back prices unless you're going to send me the paper version too!"
1,No sleep.,"I didn't personally find this product to be of any assistance in alleviating my insomnia. I found Hyland's Calms Forte to be much more effective. Also, Hyland's Calms Forte is a tablet which is intended to be swallowed, the Hyland's Insomnia formula is to be dissolved under the tongue and has an awful bitter taste to it. I hope others have better results from this product, but I was dissapointed."
2,Does not work for me,"I cannot say that this will not work for other people - but does not have the desired effect on me. Carrying a label of Insomnia tablets, I'd expect more."
1,didnt work at all,"The directions say to take two to three tabs every 4 hours as needed. I took two one night, (it didnt do anything)..then took three tabs the next night,(Same results) . If anything, I got more awake waiting for the stuff to work,,,Dont waste your money."
1,Are you joking with this price?,I can go to BB&B and get a 5 piece place setting for a little over $100.00
5,Still one of my all-time favorites,"I bought this album months ago on a whim and fell in love with it almost immediately. The lyrics are incredible (I couldn't put this away until I had them memorized), and the musicians obviously know what they're doing. But the best thing is, the wonderful first impression never faded. After all this time, it's still one of the best albums in my collection, and I love that I can play it straight through without having to skip around filler and/or junk.I can't wait for more from this band."
3,"Highly anticipated, very underwhelming","I heard an excellent song from Wavorly and thought I'd check out the album. I had the highest hopes for the album that I've had in a long time and found myself very let down. Outside of one excellent song and probably 2 good songs, those remaining seem to lack spark and lyrics lack depth and are rather typical cliché Christian music. I had great hopes. They have some solid bases, but it just didn't hit it right. Some songs didn't fit the rest of the album and while variety is great generally, these misfit songs completely threw off the feel of the rest of the album because they were so far from the base sound."
4,Good,This is a good book. A solid look into how media itself falls out of the hands of the producer and becomes subject to manipulation - and a strong place for further research along these lines.
4,A must-have to save your carpets!,"Got a set of these for my husband's vehicle as well as my own. They're both comfortable while driving and efficient at keeping water from sloshing all over my floors. My husband was able to install them in less than 5 minutes and they've stayed in place (not even a wiggle) ever since. While I was originally concerned they'd smell artificial/plastic-y, I haven't noticed an odor at all. If I had kids I wouldn't even let them in my car without putting mats like these in the back first.BOTTOM LINE: Essential for keeping your carpets looking good!"
3,good enough,Grizzly heated coffee mug is a good product.the only problem i have is.the plug has a heat control system in the plug.because it heats the coffee up and then cools it off. i want mine to stay hot. so what i do is unplug it and replug it back in.that seems to work to keep it hot.
3,"Solid, but not quite ""it"" for a MacBook Pro 15.4""","This item feels very solid, but is not quite suitable for a MacBook Pro 15.4"". Width and height are great and it has a nice strap in it to hold the laptop in place.However the downside would be the lack of something to grab onto when trying to pick up this item - like a handle or something. The way it is right now makes it not very comfortable/easy to grab this bag.Another downside is that the inner dimension is a little too high to have just your MacBook Pro (15.4"") in there, or too thin to add your powersupply without damaging your laptop.The one I purchased is right now cathing dust - I will not be using it for my laptop ..."
3,A Debate Movie,"As a high school debate coach, I use this movie ocassionally in class. It illustrates the atmosphere of college forensics tournaments, including events other than debate, even though it is not precise in portraying ""reality."" My students like to examine the debates and critique what happens in the climactic final round in front of the Supreme Court. Kurt Cameron and Jami Gertz have great appeal with high school students. As a movie, it is about average in quality and storyline--it is fairly predictable and slightly melodramatic; however, it is one of the few movies to provide a glimpse into competitive speech, so it will be of particular interest to those who come into contact with this activity (parents, students, teachers, etc.)."
4,An excellent character study revolving around Roe vs. Wade,"Listen to Me is a profound and moving drama starring the great Roy Scheider and big 80's stars Kirk Cameron and Jami Gertz. The story involves a college debate team's attempts to make emotional sense of their issues about their assigned topic: abortion. Arguing both sides, as debaters must, they come to terms with their true opinions and find peace with each other."
4,A movie to watch just for fun!,The acting wasn't GREAT and the story line would OBVIOUSLY never happen. Who would actually tell something so personal as to getting an abortion after being raped to win a debate when she never told anyone else before? (sorry for giving a way part of the movie) But the reason why I give it so many stars is because it had such an affect on me that I've remembered this movie from when I was a child with fond memories. Going past all the bad acting and the far from being realistic it was moving enough to make me remember it. If you remember to watch the movie just to watch a FICTIONAL STORY it can actually be a great film.
4,"Video Tape ""Listen to Me""","Tape box was old, but tape played just fine. I was a little disappointed in the debate because pro-life side was won on emotion and it's winnable without emotion. Put it under a microscope and it's homicide of a human life. Just because homicides will always exist is no reason to make them legal. The Supreme Court violated voters' rights when they overturned the states' rights to keep abortion illegal. I live in Michigan and stood in line for hours to vote against legalizing abortion 38 years ago (late in 1972). A few months later (January 1973), the Supreme Court jammed abortion down the throats of every state who had voted against it."
1,A Debater in Fantasy Land,"As much as I'd like to think that my debate career was on the same line as College football quarterback, some how it just didn't have the same impact. I viewed this movie the same way geologists viewed 10.0 and Astonomers viewed Armageddon. It was pretty laughable. Knowing that Tom Miller, UCLA Debate coach, was the consultant for this movie explains it all. I truly believe that this movie expresses how he views himself"
1,Waste of time and money,"Having read so many favorable reviews of this book, I was shocked at how bad it was. I forgot that for most readers, if the sex is hot and plentiful, the quality of the book is irrelevant. 147 pages of sex, torture, abuse. That's it. If you took it all out, what you'd be left with is about 20 pages, and I'm probably being generous. Problems: no character development at all, only enough plot to hang the sex on, and clumsy writing.What I was looking for was insights into the training of the slave, and the development of his mental adjustment to slavery. Instead, I found cliche after cliche, the most outstanding one being the slave going from hatred of his abuser to falling in love with him. From one extreme to the other with very little in between."
5,Who Knew?,"First of all Seo is hilarious. I love the tongue in cheek approach saving the ecosystem and looking great while doing it.On a serious note: This is a great book just on the level of helping you get organized about a renovation, clean-up or decoration project. It is full of great and easy ideas, presented in an entertaining way and well-organized. I am definitely not a hardcore eco-activist, but that's great thing about the book. Danny's suggestions are about doing things you were already going to do, but doing them right."
1,Too much self promotion,"Disappointing. Some nice photos. Overall much too much self promotion. Many ideas are common sense.Also, the most eco-friendly thing many of us can do is keep the stuff we have already. This book encourages us to go buy more things!"
3,"Good concept, but missed the target.","Grammar is boring, frustrating, and complex. At least, that's the impression I got from taking it in school. This book attempts to take a fun (well, not-so-boring) approach to explain it all... And for the most part it does well. It's concise, and the examples are good. Where things fall apart is when the book refers to parts of grammar that haven't been explained yet. For example, starting with Quick Quiz #8 (page 25), the reader is asked to identify prepositional phrases, but phrases and clauses aren't covered until page 59. Naturally, you'll miss a lot of the questions. The answers to the quizzes seldom have explanations. If an answer seems to contradict a grammar rule or just not make sense, you're left hanging. Discouraging? You bet. If you were confused by grammar in school, this book may help -- but don't expect it to answer all your questions or eliminate frustration with the topic."
5,Prepare to test and more,I purchased this book in order to review for my upcoming state test. It offers quick and clear summaries as well as specific grammar rules. Excellent for anyone needing a refresher in grammar.
3,Okay book - not that easy to read,Book covers a lot of valuable information but it's not a very easy read. The exercises are helpful but don't do a great job reinforcing the information just covered.
4,The Truth IS Out There (deep under Morningstar Crescent),Great paranoid romp through the bowels of governmental and alien conspiracies. Why for God's sake is Douglas Adams published in the States and not Rankin. Only the men under Morningstar Crescent know for sure.
3,"Pretty weird, even for me","I enjoy some pretty weird stuff when it comes to films, but this left me a bit perplexed. Supposedly based on the famous ""American Gothic"" painting, but taken into David Lynch/Guy Maddin territory via Marilyn Manson videos, or SOMETHING...WTF? Most of the time focuses on the old farmer from the painting, going on about once being a man but now, he's nothing...and there's some very disturbing imagery going on, which is the stuff of nightmares. And I do like weirdness, but this was a bit too weird, even for me. There's even some short films on the DVD, and I watched one, hmm, even weirder. Definitely not for all tastes, and probably not for mine."
5,Awesome!,Years ago my husband and I got hooked into this series. It's cool in the suspenseful way. I will say they episodes are out sequence and if you look below at another review you will find the correct way to watch them and it works. Thanks. We have enjoyed the dvd and show again.
1,Not worth it.,"Useless, its waste of money. nothing much useful information. I returned the book. Got better information in google itself."
1,SAP HR Certification Review?,"This book has nothing to do with the SAP HR Certification. The description of the book is misleading amazon buyers.I can't find the words to describe the book, 75 questions to summarized all SAP HR! and some of the answers are just a SAP Note Number!!.Amazon, please remove ""SAP HR Certification Review"" from the title, you are lying to your customers."
1,SAP HCM Certification,I was under the impression that this book should help in the HCM certification. It did not. Was a waste of my money.
1,Waste of Money,"My friend bought this in amazon and shipped me to India at a total cost of US$98.Shocked to see the content. oh my God....The book has only one intention 'Make hay while the sun shines.."" . mNo sincerity in bringing out a good book.Think twice b4 buying books which are not giving access to their few pages to judge."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME,"Horrible! This book is a result of the constant flood of ""what are some interview questions for (insert SAP module here)?"" questons on the SCN/SDN forums. These questions are largely posed by lazy people wanting an easy ""in"" to the SAP world. On the other side, people respond with copy-pasted lists of questions and answers culled from other similar/same posts in order to get easy ""points"". It's a never ending, sad cycle. And now, here's a book that just collects all the same posts and tries to make a buck. Save yourself time and money.....visit SAP's own site and do REAL research to prepare for interviews and certification."
3,Decent Enough I Suppose,"I generally don't care for compilations but this one isn't bad. The biggest problem I have always had with UFO is inconsistency and really their best Album is the live record ""Strangers In The Night"" so a compilation is probably fitting and best in this case. And while it is true that ""Love To Love"" is a classic timeless track ultimately UFO has not aged gracefully but the best of what they had to offer is pretty much covered here."
4,Michael Haydn,"His older brother gets more attention but Michael Haydn wrote some very good stuff, too, as shown by this CD. Nice listening."
2,Save your money folks.,"This looks so much nicer than it actually is.First of all the roses are a cardboard picture, not silk. For the money they should be. Second the candy are tiny,stale little sample sacks.It is a very poor value and quality. Send flowers,do not waste your time on this. Most of these commercial baskets are like this a gyp."
1,don't bother,"Don't waste your time and money on this book. The directions stink, the maps are awful, it's waaaaaay overworded, and it has all the personality of a flat tire. Buy Timm Muth's book instead. Or anything for that matter."
3,"Sorry, but I just can't appreciate this boring book.","Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I pretty much think this book stinks. I only got halfway through, but I was so bored, I couldn't read anymore. Oh, well. Just not my taste, I guess."
4,"Like a novel, only nonficition","Don't be fooled into passing up this book because of its hideous bright red book jacket. It is a good book, albiet only 189 pages. Written in fisrt person, Windows on the River Neva is an incite into the thoughts of a privileged youth mixed with the reflections and opinions of his adult counterpart who has gained wisdom and maturity through his family's flight from Russia. Paul Grabbe never attemps to assert what he does not know, but he does unfortunately shift from past to present too quickly at some parts which takes away some suspense and itensity the book may have otherwise had. Nevertheless, it is worth reading and is filled with passages describing a mischievous, exuberant child caught up in life's splendor until swept away from his country by revolution. I give this book 4 stars instead of five because I feel some chapters were extraordinarily, awkwardly short."
5,A perfect introduction to the knotted Free Will problem,"An excellent basic introduction to the contemporary Free Will debate. Robert Kane, one of leading libertarian philosophers of free will, lucidly and concisely introduces the reader to all positions on the debate, and, what's most important, he's foremostly fair and unobtrusive about his position. The only flaw is, in my opinion, a much too short coverage of God's foreknowledge and human free will, but it does not deter from the general impression about this great book. A recommended read for anyone interested about the question of Free Will."
2,A Little Obscure,"You may find some of these essays interesting because of the historical material (i.e., quotes from GA's and other church teachings and historical details), but, in general, the essays cover topics far too obtuse to be of interest to the general reader. However, if you are interested in 'deep theological questions,' you may find the discusssions interesting."
1,Beginner's swahilli (Hippocrene Master) audio cassette,"This was an awful, awful quality of audio cassettes. Hardly audible, did not come with a text. Almost completely illegible. Total waste of money!"
2,"Avoid, product design FAIL","For some reason the folks at startech decided to go for style over substance; why they would do that for an item that screws into the back of your case I don't know.Anyway, these things look really nice when you take them out of the package. they're very shiny. upon closer inspection you notice that the metal is ridiculously thin; like soda can thin. because they're so thin, they don't sit flush like they're supposed to; they twist one way or the other; it's impossible to get them to fit properly.I bought these to add a little structural integrity to a cheap case, and for that purpose they completely fail. they might work better in some other type of case. I also feel they're overpriced, but maybe they're something of a specialty item"
4,Very nice for the price!,"The armoire is solid and very pretty. It definitely is not white but cream colored. I say to the previous reviewer that said it was cheap, it's $125! Not exactly high end furniture prices. The drawers will pull right out, there are no stops on them. I really like the piece and am very happy with it. I gave it 4 stars only because you have to attach the top and it takes two people to get it right. If not careful you can attach it crooked and it won't shut right. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Very disappointed!,"I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. It looked so pretty. The first one arrived and the lid was broken in half, so I sent it back. Unfortunately I didn't unpack and really look at the first one (I would not have reordered). the second one was unbroken. The paint job on these is marginal at best. The drawers all were very rough to pull out. Grandpa spent several hours sanding and applying plastic runners on drawers so they pulled smoothly. I do not feel it is of very good quality. My granddaughter is only ten and it will be OK for her ""little girl"" jewelry , but I am very disappointed. Do not expect much!"
4,A baby step in the right direction,"Let's face facts: this book will not turn you into a savvy investor any more than reading the Cliff Notes on Macbeth will make you a scholar of English literature. The back cover claims the book will help you ""master the essentials"" of Wall Street, and this is only a slight boast - it will introduce you to the fundamentals with brevity and clarity, then point you toward more information in print and on the web. To that end, the book is certainly a good investment."
3,Do You Really Want To Take the Shortcut?,"If you're like me, then you are embarrassed to even be considering buying Cliffs Notes for Investors. Although the booklet uses simple, easy to understand language and covers several basic investment strategies, nothing can take the place of real research and true understanding. That will come from experience and extensive study. This book's main purpose could be to impress your friends with some newfound lingo."
1,From 1 Professor to Another,"As a constant and intense reader who spends hundreds of dollars each year with Amazon (and a retired political science professor) I have not been moved to write a review until now. This book is essentially pro-Marxist drivel posing as serious academic inquiry. It is a good example of the angry, left-wing ideologues (being supported by TAX DOLLARS in PUBLIC universities) longing for a return of Lenin. The really sad thing is what such people are teaching our children."
3,Now it is of little value other than historical,"This book can be considered a collection of 1,000 travel postcards from around the world that were taken in 1954. All are in black and white and show tourist attractions with short captions explaining the images. As is fitting for travel brochures targeted at Americans, more space is allocated to areas deemed more attractive to Americans. For example, six pages are devoted to the sights and attractions of Cuba while there is one page for Yugoslavia, two pages for Hong Kong and three pages for Greece. Most of Africa is not mentioned, there are three pages for Egypt, two for British East Africa and four for South Africa.Of little value to the modern reader as a travel document, this book shows parts of the world as they once were, all tidy and inviting. From what you see here, you would need only a cool drink to make the moment."
3,Just not what I was expecting,"Even though I looked at the reviews, I did not expect the watch to be so small and for ten dollars I think I could have spent the money on another book, but I did fall in love with the watch face though."
3,Good work watch,"Materials aren't great, but it's reasonable for the price. Good for on the job work. Wouldn't wear it out anywhere."
3,Nice little watch for the price.,"Pretty much got what I expected for the price. The only complaint would be the size of the band. If you have anything other than a child size wrist, you'll be using the last holes in the strap to secure the band. I got it to use as a work watch around the shop and house. Easy to read face and so far, so good."
3,Good watch for the money,The watch looks good and so far (3 weeks) keeps good time- can't ask for much more in a $10 watch. Only problem is minor- the band is slightly hard to fasten. I sometimes have to rest my watch hand on a table to stabilize it in order to fasten the buckle.
3,A no-nonsense 24 hours watch.,"Upon opening the box, this watch can almost be mistaken for a toy. This watch has a simple design and function with no bells or whistles.I wanted an inexpensive 24 hour dial, and that is what I received. This 24 hour dial is rare at this price, so I consider it a good deal! I have owned this watch for approximately 30 days. No problem so far."
5,Luxury and Class - Defined!,"How do I feel every time I wear this stunning watch? .....like a million bucks! This Casio Men's Analog watch is a true head turner...especially among the ladies!! I would imagine they probably think I'm some big wig jet setter that owns a 40 foot yacht. and I certainly could own a yacht since this elegant watch is also ""water resist"" which means that it resists water, which is important because you wouldn't want any water working it's way into the fine craftsmanship that went into this luxurious timepiece. Another stunning feature is the ebony plastic strap contrasting with the 'coffee-stained ivory' face, which always makes me think of that song that Paul Mcarthy and Lional Richie would sing together. It's a timepiece fit to be worn out on the town and at the theater, like I did last night at ""the Bourne Legacy""."
3,It's a small watch,"The watch does what it is asked and nothing more. If you are looking for a watch with a second-hand as I was, it does the trick. However, the watch is very thin and smaller than I expected. Doesn't look right on my arm as a 6 foot 200 pound guy."
2,Worked great while it lasted...,Watch arrived with a dead battery. Fine. After the battery replacement the watch worked well and kept great time. The watch then stopped working about 7 weeks after the purchase. Watch repair store tested the battery which was found to be fine. So unfortunately to the trash it went. The watch otherwise would've gotten 5 stars for the looks and price point. You get what you pay for.
5,I Love It!,"I loved this book! I've read it so many times I thought I must have a copy. I live in Idaho and I enjoy reading about places I've been to here in the northwest. It's an intriguing tale good for the young and the young at heart. The book is about a family who moves to Northern Idaho so the mother can teach in a mining camp. the problem is, there are no schools. So, along with a large Swedish woman, a thin Irish man, and two spunky kids, she sets up a restaurant. I wonderful story everyone can enjoy!"
5,Fun history of the early northwest.,I first read this book in 4th grade and reread it several times in one year. I can remember telling my mom all about it because it was based in the Northwest. I loved the way the family worked together to give their mom a deserved surprise. I recently found another book by the author and was reminded of my love for this book. I hope I can find a copy to read to my children and let them enjoy the fun.
5,Health Care Meltdown,"This book was interesting, fast-paced, incredibly eye-opening and well-researched."
4,Failed U.S. Healthcare: Practical and Ethical Cures,"Bob Lebow has lucidly highlighted the failure of our chaotic healthcare system. He offers in an excellent literary style the flaws in applying a market-driven approach to healthcare and provides practical and ethical solutions to the mess which confronts us. Publically financing healthcare while maintaining individual private practitioner control promotes freedom of choice for patients, and guaranteed care for all of us. Furthermore, this would eliminate the ethical dilemma presented by our system where financial status dictates quality of care, and insures that less fortunate individuals receive inferior care or none at all."
3,What We Should All Know by Now,"Dr. Lebow's passionate plea for health care reform, although written five years ago, still resonates today. He has seen it from the trenches in public clinics. To the critics of health care reform, he will be labeled as a socialist which is nonsense. He effectively points out that insurance and pharmaceutical companies lobby for protection of their obscene profits. Dr. Lebow astutely points out many of the myths of the current system. As the chapters progress he is sometimes repetitive and preachy, but this can be overlooked."
3,When your children need spiritual guidance..................,"Provides better understanding and greater inspiration to pray for your children when they need it most. Provides powerful testimony of how Norvel Hayes learned to ""stand in the gap"" for his daughter, with her own story of the years that God used her father to pray her back into a close relationship with Jesus Christ. Includes five scripturally based prayers."
4,"Review of Student's Solutions Manual for Physical Chemistry, Seventh Edition","The Student's Solutions Manual for Physical Chemistry, Seventh Edition is very helpful and provides enough information in their problem solving to understand the basis of the chapters and the problems."
2,Great idea - needs better construction,"I have an arthritic hand condition and cannot hold a normal lever-handheld watering nozzle on. In my excitement of finding this item, I bought three; one for each outside hose that we have. However, all three nozzles broke within a few months of using them; one within one week of my purchase. In two of them, something in the plastic watering head broke and the tops fell off. The third one, the on-off switch broke. Great idea, just needs to be made of metal or something."
5,A refreshing breeze from the current pop poop out there,"Here are lyrics that make you listen, make you think and make you laugh. I have never heard the angelic sounds of a piano contrasted with such witty writing. This is one for everyone's collection, no matter what taste...it's in a category all of it's own."
3,Quality is lacking.,"I purchased Goober for my granddaughter but I don't believe I will give him to her. Goober's fur seems to be falling out without anyone playing with him. I trimmed all the longer threads and fur and I think he needs another trimming. I don't think this bear will hold up for very long under the tender care of a two year old. That said, he is one of the cutest bears I have ever seen."
5,Big cuddly bear,"If you want a big, cuddly bear, this is for you. It doesn't do anything, has no bells and whistles, but it is great for cuddling and super soft. I love Gund products, and this does not disappoint."
3,Tropocal excitement,Very entertaining book for boat enthusiast. Kept me in mystery most of the time and only is predictable briefly. I am a boater who does like to fish and Mr. Wyle definitely reveals his disdained for the fishing community so if you can put that aside it's a good book with tropical excitement. I would recommend it.
2,Convoluted,"Living in the Bahamas and an ex-boater, I expected to embrace this book. Instead, I found it difficult to like the characters. The main character and his girlfriend are almost perfect and the guy knows everything. Humility is borne from the Bahamas, and these feature characters really don't get it at all..."
5,A page turner,"This book is very exciting and paints a vivid picture of boating around Grand Bahama Island.Sandy Semerad,Author of Mardi Gravestone"
5,Instruction Book for Living the Life of Your Dreams,"I read this book when I was struggling with my job, but didn't know for sure what to do next. This was the first book I read that really helped me to break out of my limited way of thinking about my career. The first half of the book encourages you to suspend reality for a while, just like watching a great movie! You can dream as big as you like and get real excited about the possibilities of a life beyond the one you are in. Then the second half brings you gently back down to reality, but provides you with real tools for capturing the essence of your dream and finding a way to start moving toward it. For me, I've always dreamed of ""making a difference"" in the world. But I spent my time helping companies market their websites. This book helped me to see that if I could find some companies that are ""making a difference"" and help them with my interactive marketing skills, then I too would be ""making a difference""!"
4,a wonderful discovery process,"A wonderful book to aid anyone in the process of discovering who they are and how to find a path to their dreams. Barbara gives lots of positive reinforcement, but is surprisingly practical. By the time I had filtered through numerous chapters of discovery exercises, I was exhausted. I wasn't sure I would really find the focus I needed to define myself and articulate the next phase of my life. However, when I got to the chapter on defining ""touchstones"" the homework paid off and I found something at my core that defined everything I wanted in my life. Hats off to Barbara for her humor, style, and wisdom to make the process so enjoyable. Bravo!"
3,Not That Funny,I bought this for my brother and we both watched it and at the end we thought it was okay but nothing special. I didn't even laugh that much and my brother laughed at one scene only and that was it. I don't recommend buying this because it is a waste of time and money. Buy a different one if you can find one but this is the last blooper movie I will buy.
1,not a leather,this case is not made of leather! the product description is misleading. the case has a nice and slick design but it it not made of leather!
2,good but not so much,"good but not quite. Good stuff, but after prolonged use for 5 months, split rear clip leather that protected him, hurting my skin"
4,No Comparisons Please,"Deadboy and the Elephantmen are a two piece band with a male lead singer/guitar player and female drummer. They just don't rely so much on red and white fashion gimmicks. The lead singer has an incredible voice that rivals that of Peter Murphy and a very able drummer/back up vocalist. Very promising, innovative, and pop-y."
4,Makes me want more,"This is the first I've heard of Dax, but I'm intrigued, and look forward to checking out his previous stuff. My favorites on this album are also the most raw, and rockin'. Tracks 1, 6, and 8 through 12 are fantastic. The others are just a little slow for my taste. Can't wait to see them live!"
2,Oh dear,"Come on, you cant seriously believe this is a good album. I believe those below just cant bring themselves to say that Dax has put out a dud here. Im not some 'hung-up' Acid Bath fan either. Agents of Oblivion was a great project, and the first Deadboy album (If this is hell...) was incredible, just a shame Amazon doesnt carry it. This album is completely (i hate to say it) boring, and quite frankly soulless. The lyrics are superior, as always, but the music is spineless, and Dax's voice doesnt shine as much as past efforts.Find D + the elephantmen's first album, which is one of the best album's Dax has ever been involved in, and that is saying something. Im left bitterly disappointed by this release."
2,"Few hits, mostly misses with simple alt folk","1 1/2With the majority of songs being written in very simplistic 2 or 3 chord change settings, any artist needs to be on the side of subtlety, crafting movements out of minimalism..Deadboy and Elephantmen use this formula to partial success..The singer is obviously very talanted in his delivery and conviction, and the space used in between the sparse arrangements is usually worthy of the White stripes/Black Keys comparisons..But alas, the album cannot hold up, with material eventually giving in to it's overall laziness."
1,Weak bond,"Very weak ""ultra bond"" glue. Even the glue that touched my fingers came off. Generic waste of money. Pass this one up."
1,One of the worst NY fictions around,"This book was a huge dissapointment. I'm a big fan of NY crimefiction & political thrillers and was so excited when this cameout that I rushed out to but it. MISTAKE! It wasn't very well written, the dialogue was painfully amature and the suspense just wasn't there. And by the way, having read the author's bio, he thinks a little too highly of himself in his pseudo-autobiographical fantasy portrayal of himself as the lead character, not to mention that a number of other characters are thinly veiled screeds on real officials in NY city government.Stick to Tom Wolfe or the Waterworks!"
5,Amazing,"LOVED this series. It is technically YA, but I am in my 30's and I thought it was amazing. The only noticeably YA aspects were its lack of inappropriate things (ex. sex and excessive gore). It did not lack depth, suspense, action or intrigue."
5,Great book fast service,The book was an old library book with the plastic sleeve stuck on over the dust cover. It was still in great shape though all the library stickers were a bit obnoxious. However cloth library binding is far superior to some of the cardboard versions going around today. The King of Attolia is an excellent story continuation for the Thief of Eddis series. Turner is a ver precise writer who doesn't give anything away until the exactly right moment.
2,What the....,"I was thinking that this was going to be a fun read, however, as it turned out it was written as if it was in old English. I had to give up after about 100 pages."
5,A Great Summay of the Entire Industry!!,"This book was the greatest. As an aspiring screenwriter and director, it helps to get a large grasp on the industry. This book helped me enormously. It tells everything you could possibly need to know from employment in Movies & TV to minimum wage to contractual issues to what to stay away from. Just an all around great book."
3,EBN CEP is the Sheeeeeeeee-ot,"Watching this, realize that these innovators made this performance before the current standards of editing on the desktop were available.This is an amazing ambience for cocktail parties, and a definite mind distraction with creativity beyond belief.One word: WOW"
3,Exo Terra Sun-Glo Daylight Halogen Lamp 35 Watt,"I have to replace these lamps at least once a month. Not sure what the issue is, but I've tried shutting it down over night, and other power options, but I cant get any life out of it. You are roped into their lamps, due to the fixture and brand as well as size. I will continue reluctantly buy them (as cheap as humanly possible), because the purpose, fit and finish works out the best for my turtle."
2,"Poor quality - inferior product compared to past seasons,","Before buying these sandals, realize that they have less cushioning than past seasons. So, if you are looking to replace last year's favorite Teva sandal, think again!This season's sandal lacks the quality and performance of past Teva products, and they do not care. I contacted customer service to return the sandal and they refused to pay for return shipping - even though their product is the problem. They acknowledged, though, that the design did change from last year.For the price, you would be better off buying a cheap pair of sandals at your local Walmart, or finding a more reliable high-end flip-flop."
5,Sep 09,All the required information and specifications prior to making a purchase decision were available. The rating for the products could be added in a graphical format.
2,Poor quality - inferior product compared to past seasons,"Before buying these sandals, realize that they have less cushioning than past seasons. So, if you are looking to replace last year's favorite Teva sandal, think again!This season's sandal lacks the quality and performance of past Teva products, and they do not care. I contacted customer service to return the sandal and they refused to pay for return shipping - even though their product is the problem. They acknowledged, though, that the design did change from last year.For the price, you would be better off buying a cheap pair of sandals at your local Walmart, or finding a more reliable high-end flip-flop."
2,Disappointed,"For the price I paid, these flip flops were disappointing. The distinctive Teva strap was good-looking but the sole was just like that of a flip flop you could buy at your local dollar store. I needed them as part of a gift basket and didn't have the time to return them otherwise I definitely would have."
5,Informative and comprehensive,"I do silk painting and other fabric art forms and was looking to branch out in my art. I found Complex Cloth to be very complete in instruction and details. A beginner, as well as someone more experienced could benefit from this book."
3,GOOD!,"why is everyone talking about the price? if you need to descuss the rice at all, you should'n buy it, end of conversation... anyways, this is a fun tool, i use it a lot, i acually didn't buy it, i downloaded it, but it's pretty much the same thing, yeah, its a good tool! any career, from like, bathroom cleaner, to something grand, such as company manager? anything, this is great fun, you can also make disaster things, like you can set the career to randomly make your sim die or get burned, robbed, etc. FUN!"
4,Easy to Use,"Yes, it is true that you can find the non ""pro"" version on line. However, it is not as nice as this and the online version really never worked on my game. This is easy to use even though there is not an instruction manual included. Creating new careers is fun and it also lets you override the old careers like paranormal or slacker."
3,dont listen,"...The reason we rate games is to give others an idea of what the program is actually like....I gave it three stars for its thoughtfulness, not its price. Too expensive for a program that basically alters a few letters and numbers."
4,Almost perfect,The songs are great and most of them are soothing. This cd would be perfect if the last 2 songs were not energetic ones.
5,"Could live without her, but wouldn't want to.","Sell the ranch if you must, but get this cd, and all of the others by Connie Kaldor. ""Small Cafe"" is available in the U.S.. From Canada, you can get ""Gentle of Heart"", ""Out of the Blue"", ""Wood River"", ""Moonlight Grocery"", ""Love is a Truck"". She is in a league of her own."
5,thank god it's on CD because we've worn out two cassettes,"This is my son's (now 6 years old) all-time favorite lullaby music and mine too. He will be so happy I've found it again. (It is no longer available where I purchased the first two tapes.) Beautiful meaningful songs to hum or sing along with, even if your voice is poor, your baby won't mind. I bought the first copy sound unheard when he was an infant and was pleasantly surprised. He was not pleased when the first tape broke, nor the second for that matter, and has repeatedly asked me to buy another. French and English combinations make repeated listening less tiresome to the adult."
5,the cats me-ow,this is the best oil filter wrench on the market fits wide range of sizes. have not ran across a spin on filter that i could not remove with this wrench
4,Good interim release for a band on the way up,"Five stars for the band's next full-length studio release (I hope!). This EP may slip under the radar, since it is comprised of mainly covers, and an abbreviated version of ""The Road Leads Where It's Led"" from the previous album- this is a bit of a puzzle....great song, but why cut out the album intro?? The good news is that the cover songs are great. TSM have performed all of them while touring tirelessly, and it is good to have them all on one disc, since they are otherwise scattered on import EPs.""Immer Wieder (De Luxe)"" is simply majestic, and ""Girl from the North Country"" is given a startling psychedelic treatment awash with keyboards and processed guitar, all melded together with a melancholy vocal....this band is intelligent, incredibly musical, and deserves the raves they are receiving. This album will keep the fans happy while awaiting the new album, and may win them some new admirers along the way."
3,Paranormal State: Season 2,"I like Paranormal State, however, we have had a huge problem with Supermart Customer Service b-c the second DVD was defective. I emailed customer service twice, never got a response. I tried calling and the number on their website is incorrect. I emailed them several times through Amazon and after several weeks they finally responded after I already sent the defective product back. I sent it certified to the correct address and I have not received the signed copy where it shows they have received it. I bought it brand new. I will never buy from that company again. I have never had any problems until now with anything I have purchased from Amazon until now."
5,Awesome as always!,"This show, well I would probably call it something like true to life events, is the best that is out there. I am constantly trying to recruit friends and family to watch it with me. Not to scare them but to prove Ryan Buell and his team are out there to help the client first and then try to contact anything supernatural. Also that they actually care about the clients well being and not money puts it that much further up on my list. Oh who am I kidding? Paranormal State is my number one show! It's just utterly amazing!"
3,"Written, directed, produced and starred in...","Need I say more?I do have to give the writer/producer/director/actor credit--he overcame some serious obstacles to make this film (full disclosure: I had also once obtained the rights to produce this as a student film--but I never did a damn thing with it!!)Bryan Moore does a very admirable job. It's definitely an independent production, and a labor of love. Add at least one point if you're a Lovecraft fan, add two points in you had ever obtained the rights to make the film yourself.Moves slow at times (it IS Lovecraft--except for Reanimator, when did ANY Lovecraft film ever move quickly?), but Jack Donner's performance can be absolutely riveting.The ""reveal"" at the end is minimal--I've always felt that the audience deserves a little more. But that's me.And definitely spend the time with the special features. Two words: Dukey Flyswatter!! What is WITH that guy!?!(Note: NOT a part of the Cthulhu mythos!)"
3,Not quite what I expected,"Having looked at this product online, it seemed like the perfect answer for an upcoming trip... After receiving it, it appears as though it will work, but is somewhat smaller than I expected, and perhaps a little bit tippy. I had previously purchased a similar item from a local store, and the seat was spacious and seemed comfortable to sit on. I wanted to get a second one for my husband, but was unable to find another locally, so ordered this one online. Since my husband is quite a bit larger than me, I guess he will be using the one I had before, and I will have to use this one. It will serve the purpose, but not as well as I had hoped for."
3,It's Ok,This product is described as a splitter/amplifier. The splitter function works fine but I haven't seen the amplification portion doing a remarkable job. We use it at church for a 70' run and the image quality is ok.
3,Beige is the New Ivory,"I ordered ""ivory"" because the ""tan"" one I ordered (albeit from a different manufacturer) was way too dark. So the ivory one arrives, and by golly the box says it is ivory, but the color is much closer to brown than white, which is what it looks like on the online image - certaily more of what I expected to receive. So if you are looking for an ivory color closer to white as the online impage portrays, it won't be what you will get - this ""ivory"" is beige at best."
1,"DO NOT BUY, FIND ANOTHER WAY","Works great as long as you want this to be a permanent feature, and I mean forever, of wherever you are putting it. When you try to take it off, you will either have tape on your floor forever or you will take the floor up with it. I repeat, if you lay this down, you will need to replace your floor to get rid of it."
3,scuffs easily,"I purchased this to use for wiring in my living room that could get stepped on. I'm a little resistant to use it, as it seems to scuff easily, and could end up being an eyesore in my application."
4,"Works fine, scuffs easily","Like another reviewer, I boiled the coiled up protector and then laid in out flat. Boiling took care of both the plastic smell and coiling. I laid it out flat and have had no problems with the ends curling up. A heavy, very sharp knife (like a meat cleaver) would make a much cleaner cut (if you need to cut it down like I did) than the dull scissors I used. Meets all my needs except it scuffs way too easily. Not a big deal, but does make it look worn in it's first week of light use."
2,Won't stay flat,"For the life of me I cannot get this strip to lay flat. I kept it flat on the dining room floor (morning sunlight) with a couple of stools on it for two days. I layed it with the two-sided tape provided on a berber carpet, and the ends keep curling up (or rather: the ends curl down, and the spot three inches in from the end bows upward off the carpet). I've put five and eight pound weights on it for another 24 hours, but as soon as the weights are moved, it begins to curl again. I wanted this product to prevent my 9-month-old daughter from pulling a speaker wire up, but the way it won't stay flat and stuck to the carpet makes it useless for my needs.I really wish I had read the first review on this page before trying to use this product...maybe rolling up backwards and putting it back in the box for some time is the key to making it work right."
4,Solid Product... Could use more room,"Let me first say that the product is very good quality and I am happy with it so far. I bought this cord protector so that I could hide some wires that I run from my computer to my TV. These wires include a coaxial cable, a VGA cable, and a simple audio cable. The coaxial and audio cables fit with no issues whatsoever. However, the VGA cable is just too bulky to fit inside the protector. A little more room would have been ideal... this could have been accommodated quite easily if the internal supports were spaced a bit more (like another 1/2""). I ended up taping the VGA cable to the cord protector so that I won't trip over it. I'm happy with this product, but wish it could ""protect"" more cables at once."
4,Wiremold CDB Cord Protector,I received item in about a week. The wiremold (cord protector) was coiled up in a box.I uncoiled and left it out in the direct sun for about 1 1/2 hours in order to insure wiremold strip would remain flat when it returned to room temperature. I inserted the cord into the slot on the backside and plugged the cord in. Now the cord will not be a trip hazard to those passing oversame in the future.
3,Does it Job,I purchased this to go into my husband's office. I like the brown color as it blends in better with the desk and flooring. We've had no issues with it not lying flat to the floor. It covers well and stays in place.No complaints!
3,Not easy to use,"In the end, this product met the need. But getting it to lie flight takes some work. Getting more than 1 cord into the work channel is also very difficult. It does flatten out quickly, but in my case, I needed to find someting 8 feet long to place on it for a few days. Bending it backwards did not flatten it completely and you really needed to put something heavy on it for an extended period of time."
3,Difficult to use,"Because the product was rolled up and shipped, it maintained that shape and tried to revert back to it. It wouldn't stay down even after stretching it out, placing heavy objects on it and letting it sit overnight!"
3,won't stay put,"I set this up across a doorway in a somewhat heavy foot traffic area. It looks ok, but most importantly no one is tripping over the cord when they walk past. I used the sticky tape that came with it to hold it in place, but unfortunately once it's been (accidentally) moved from the taped spot, it won't go back and there's a horrible sticky residue left behind. Will most likely have to clean all the tape off and re-tape at some point."
4,Takes a while to relax for a flat finish,"Unroll this product and allow to relax a bit (or heat slightly with a blow dryer) to allow a flat application. The tape that is included was kind of annoying, but necessary.Did the trick on the extension cord running to the middle of our living room."
5,Cord Protector,"I had a difficult time locating this cord protector locally, so once again turned to Amazon. I was so sick of tripping over my lamp cord that this provided the safety needed in the small space beside my couch. I was able to cut the size piece that I needed, which made it preferable to other cord protectors I located."
4,Not Breedlove but still GREAT,I loved Breedlove so much and longed for Day Dyer's voice on new songs. A few songs do satisfy the craving. I also love Lenny Kravitz so it was the best of both worlds. Some songs are very Lenny and a couple are Breedlove-esqe. I'm listening to it again right now. I grows on me more and more.
5,Amazing sound!,While listening to Dan Dyer's CD I have a calming feeling that does not come often! I listen at work and I feel relaxed ... his voice is soulfull and at the same time a bit rockin'. The lyric's are nice and I can relate to them. Overall I will tell all of my friends they MUST purchase this cd! Great Job!!
4,He Does Belong,"Great start for a new voice - this album is complete and without any 'off' moments.I picked it up after reading a positive review. I had read another review that put Dyer in a James Taylor vein. After giving the CD several plays, Dyer fits more closely with artists like Kenny Loggins [as on AND IF I], Lindsey Buckingham, and Dan Fogelberg. His honesty and vocal range set him apart from the bland flatness of Taylor's music.RED ALERT starts the album off on a very strong note. My favorite track on the album would have to be the title track. Dyers effective use of his own voice for layered harmonies - and even with a few moments of special effects [SPACE ALIEN] - is a beautiful instrument in and of itself."
2,Disappointing,"I have followed Dan Dyer since 1996 when he was with a band called Breedlove. Very powerful band. His voice has always been very unique and downright soulful with a touch of Texas brash. That's why I was so excited to see Lenny Kravitz producing. I trusted LV to bring out that awesome voice in Dan Dyer. I was very disappointed in this effort. Absolutely no soul, overly produced, no experimentation in drum and rhythm tracks (which is so evident in LV's work), and could not hear the intonations, attack, and soulness of Dan's voice I love to hear. Dan Dyer can do much better than this, I know! Reach Out!"
5,Worth every penny!,I bought several Christian kid CD's for my kids(all under 6) to listen to for bedtime. This one is by far their favorite and they argue about who gets it every night for their CD player! A great compilation of songs and my oldest often recognizes songs from our Worship services now and sings along. Great music with great messages.
4,An important book for an important topic,I work supporting orphanages in third world countries. I also work with children in the US who are in dysfunctional families who receive government aid. This book supports the idea of orphanages as one of the tools in caring for children in need of support. I strongly recommend this book to anyone truly looking for ways to help children in need. It's ideas should be considered based on their merit and not on a political basis.
1,Negative stars for this one.,"If I could I would put a negative star on this one. I have been surprised at alot of the things I have read in my life and I will have to say that the fact that this was even allowed to be published is appalling. The fact that it has political (i.e. a judge) references negates the entire book. This book is followed too by a new initiative into the school systems, where parents are about to lose the control of whether thier kids take drugs for mental problems or not. If you refuse, you apparently are not a good parent and they remove your child from the home. Now to think, they will not only remove your child, but also they now want to put them in an orphanage too. With the knowledge that this book brings forth along with the new government initiative, this books primarily promotes institionalizing every child that has mental problem. Please pray or light a candle to whatever diety you follow, for our children in America, they are going to need it."
4,highly recommended,"i dun think it's overproduced like some critics said,instead all the tracks work great , those two songs featuring Thom & Richard are haunting&beautiful ,& i really love the new-version of the album including ""be there"" with Ian Brown.also the MV of ""be there"" & ""rabbit in yr headlight"" are v.good."
2,very disappointing,"If you want a good UNKLE CD, you're better off getting War Stories. I heard War Stories first, and I loved it, but it was wrong of me to assume their earlier work would be just as good, because this CD, in my opinion, is by far inferior. The music is bad, the mixing of genres sounds bad, the vocals also aren't as good as in War Stories. Two stars for some good but rare moments and some nice beats"
2,This is a serious letdown from UNKLE.,"While at least one song is great -- ""Lonely Soul"" featuring Richard Ashcroft -- only a couple are good and the rest fair to bad. This is the worst cd UNKLE's ever put out. ""The Time Has Come"" or ""Berry Meditation"" ep's are good, as are their tunes on various compilations and remixes of other people's songs. I'd pay a few bucks for this used, but otherwise you're wasting your money."
5,UNKLE!,"Unkle's debut album Psyence fiction is their best album in my opinion. It's a must have classic for every trip hop collection. A load of great artists came together for this album. The Album cover is beautiful for display, great artwork. Record plays fine except for a few skips on one of the tracks."
3,Mostly inspiration with a little irritation,3 1/2Worthwhile collaborations yield a wide array of electronic expression-most interesting and a few inept- but the disc is fun enough to challenge listeners to rearrange preferences.
4,An Exelent Cd,"I think this Cd is really good but it is not as good as Endtroducing. The best song by far is Lonely soul. That song has a kick but drum line and the other sounds are really cool. But there is one really bad song, chaos. What is that song doing on the album? Chaos is not hip hop at all. But I still think the album rules. I recomend this cd very much/"
1,I was looking forward to this,"I have been a big fan of DJ Shadow since I bought the Mo Wax headz compilation in 1995. Endtroducing is one of my favourite LPs of all time, and some of the earlier UNKLE stuff is very good too.What a turkey this turned out to be. The LP sounds so cold and dull. Most of the vocal tracks are done to a formula. It tries to cover so much and misses on almost every track. The second to last song is one of the worst things ever put on record! What the hell is that???As for my 'narrow' views. I don't think so! Stay well claer of this and go and buy other mo wax stuff. Luke Vibert, Headz comps, Sukia, Major Force West comp, any other DJ Shadow stuff."
1,why all this hype for a so common album?,"I bought this album and I didn't like it at all. It often sounds like the crummy old New Wave of 80's (Cure, Joy Division, This Mortal Coil) Yuk! Where is the Hip Hop spirit ??? Psyence Fiction is the kind of CD we end to buy because of all the hype, buzz, commercials that are all around it, and that everyone won't care/remember in 3 months. The first CD of Massive Attack or Portishead were more interesting. This album brings absolutely nothing new or original in the trip/hip hop style , whatever you want to call this style of music. It was the idea to James Lavelle to make a ""revolutionary"" album, a kinda milestone, but he has failed."
4,PSYENCE FICTION / UNKLE,"There are two unique offerings here; ""Main Theme"" and ""Blood Stain"". The rest of the album may not hold your interest. Even so, I recommend it. I was not, however, impressed with ""Rabbit in your headlights"" - voicing should have been in the lower registers, plus the opening cut (the title escapes me) simply sounded like any other gangsta' rap. The most significant effort was indeed ""Blood Stain"". It alone justifys the purchase of this album. Dark, Gothic and rich with pathos, ""Bood Stain"" can hold it's own with the Charles Mingus classic ""Goodbye, Pork Pie Hat""."
3,i can't stop owning this,"i'm giving this album three stars only because of the fact i've actually purchased it three different times now. the only reason i bought this album the first time was for ""Rabbit In Your Headlights"" the song masterfully done with the chilling voice of Thom Yorke. the album then went on to impress me in other songs, but to be completely honest, i only listened to like 4 of the songs with any regularity and i have only purchased the album 3 times now because i keep losing my copy of ""Rabbit In Your Headlights"". i really thought the album was overhyped but was worth buying three times for the only real treasure on the album.. ""Rabbit In Your Headlights""... i dont download songs i am a collector thats why i keep buying it..lol"
4,DJ Shadow and who?,"It's a shame that this album got slammed as bad as it did, but I liked it for it showed some maturity on DJ Shadow's part. He was willing to work with outside artists and create a project that was really on the lines of the DJ Shadow All-Stars. The 9/12 tempo of ""Rabbit In Your Headlights"" works great, and ""Bloodstain"" is arguably the best track on this album, complete with a slight tribute to producer Timbaland. Like ENDTRODUCING, PSYENCE FICTION has a running theme, this time one of loneliness and looking for light at the end of the tunnel. While not perfect, it is a great album that seems to suffer from hip-hop heads to say ""this wasn't hip-hop enough"" to alternative people who said this was too ""crossover"". Forget about it, this is a great album. Maybe not a ""proper"" DJ Shadow album, but definitely an important piece of the Josh Davis puzzle."
4,Unexpected beats compliments truthful styles of the artists,Play it as loud as your neighbors permit the first time around and catch the suprise of the present. The varying backgrounds of the artists involved acts as different colors on this flowing spectrum of now. A must have for the winter dayz to come.
4,Pretty decent!,"I agree with Luntns in that this album is different from Endtroducing. I'm not sure whether the vocalists add a much needed edge to Shadow's music or whether they detract from it, but I reckon this album reeeally pulls it off with some tracks; like Rabbit In your Headlights (Thom Yorke @ his peak, I think), Unreal, and the slightly overlong-but-pretty-good-anyway Lonely Soul. What I'd say is that it takes a while to appreciate most of the tracks, esp. Lonely Soul - i thought the strings sounded poncy @ 1st but I sorta got used to 'em. Anyway, it's a pretty decent album and well worth getting, even if it's only for track 6. (laf) If any1 has any views on this then email me."
1,this CD ain't worth it,"I know mo'wax recording since the beginning and like a lot someof their artist such as DJ Shadow, DJ Krush, but i'm very disapointed by this album. I've been waiting for so long and I finally wonder how come it took them 3 whole years to release a so conventional and boring CD."
4,UNKLE shows the endless potential in these artists.,"Without a doubt, 'Endtroducing' by Shadow is the best sampled c.d. of all time. The fact of producing this LP to show a similar existence between different genre's roots was definately a completed feat. Shadow was hindered slightly with vocals on the LP, yet it shows that his mastership can be shared with other talented artists. I give straight 'props' to everyone on this C.D., (Lavele, Yorke, Mike D., etc., etc...) but I give most to Shadow. 'Bloodstain' is the best song on that C.D. and I'll tell you why. When you start a groove with a hauntingly intense intro, then continue into 'breaking beats', and smooth it out with a beautiful female voice...you have the 3 loves in life: The sadness, the emotional turnaround, and the sweetness of singing! Stay real...Ice/ Gainesville, Florida"
2,This CD is very boring. A big dissapointement!,"There are a lot of great artists that work together on this CD including DJ Shadow, Mike D, Lavelle and others. I was expecting something fresh and funky. What I got was something definitely original but altogether unsatisfying and boring. When listening you can tell their is a lot of talent involved in this prodject, I really wanted to like this CD but it gives you little chance because it is almost unlistenable."
5,Great CD,"I couldn't disagree more with BjA from USA.This disc is fantasic and people I know who appreciate british rock music agree.DJ Shadow is a genius and teaming with James Lavelle to form UNKLE is sheer brilliance. The production is tight featuring tough drum beats and a stellar list a guest artists, almost a ""who's who"" in british rock (Richard Ashcroft, Badly Drawn Boy, Thom Yorke, and if you seek out the UK Import, Ian Brown, former front man of the Stone Roses, contributes ""Be There""). To top it off, they recruited Mike D. from the Beastie Boys for ""The Knock.""If you like the Verve, Radiohead, or british rock, you will definitely enjoy this disc."
4,Mailers,Strong envelopes that would never tear. They are small but excellent for CDs. Would highly reccommend this type of mailers that are made out of very strong material.
2,eh.,"i mean, they fit a small book or dvd. but thats it. theyre just super wierd looking. but they work."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I was expecting white and these are a dingy gray. I wanted to use them for large odd sized Christmas cards and could not do it because these look like they are for some industrial parts or something. The description says, ""white."" I may be able to use them for something... not sure what! I opened the one package and tried to use one of them so I can't return them. Wasted money! They may be great for parts and things you want to be sure are dry, but for me and my project... didn't even come close to what I expected. Sorry."
2,Smaller than expected.,The photo shows a shirt in the bag. But the bag is too small for a shirt. It's good for a pair of socks or underwear.
2,Poor quality,I was extremely disappointed in the quality of these mailers. They are very thin and prone to tears. I have to use 2 bags to ship most items.
5,Perfect,"Great price, great quality. Thanks!I put some fabric in and was able to get the 1st class envelope rate for 44 cents (it was less than 1 oz).But, my product was protected in the delivery process.Thanks! My shipping costs for this were free because I'm an Amazon Prime member."
1,Took very little effort to rip into several pieces,"I was very excited to receive this product based on many reviews, however I am HIGHLY disappointed with these poly shipping bags. They are SUPER thin. {I can't stress that enough}. I read a few reviews that they were difficult to tear; this is not true. They could practical rip in half if you look at them wrong. It took very little tugging effort to rip a bag into several little pieces. I have had to double and triple layer the bags so that my orders can reach their destinations until I can re-order a different brand of poly bags. These were HORRIBLE!"
4,You get what you pay for,"These mailers seem more flimsy than they appeared in the picture. But, that's what happens when you buy in bulk at a low price. Good for mailing cheap items, but I wouldn't count on mailing anything of any value in these."
4,Quality,These bags seem good. They are well made and sealable. They will come in handy and they were cheap. Better than buying one every time you need one.
3,Poly Mailers are Flimsy,"Actually, I should have expected this but without being able to actually feel the product, I didn't realize that the material was SO thin."
4,What I wanted and needed,These meet my needs but they are a bit more flimsy than I had expected. They work ok but a slightly heaviert weight would feel more secure.
5,Nice Size,This is a nice size to ship smaller items. Bags all close properly and make it through the mails in one piece.
3,Poly too thin...,"The poly this bag is made of is way to thin, The mil. thickness is about half of other poly bags I have ordered online. The flap where the glue, (adhesive) is, the sealing strip is about 1/3 the height of other sealing strips. The flap does seem to stay sealed, but a bit more adhesive would be much more secure. All in all, I guess the bags are still pretty indestructible, but a thicker mil. poly would be more beneficial. Either way i m stuck with 100 bags I'll be glad are gone after I use them. I'll order from another company next time around..."
1,These are thin cheap plastic mailers Not as described,"I have ordered Poly mailers several times from Amazon and they have always been wonderful with a nice thickness that won't tear and lined inside.The mailers that I received this time are very thin plastic bag like, with no lining. Horrible! There is no way I can use these for mailing out customers orders. I am returning them today. Amazon says in an email that I received from them that they got them from an outside seller called Amamax. I would stay away from them!"
2,Not at all like the same quality as bags ordered in the past.,I have ordered this type of bag from Amazon many times however this shipment was of a much different quality and the change was not good. The bags feel very thin and had no shape at all. Not sure why the same exact item would be so different.
4,"Not padded, but good","I WISH I had not skimmed over the one comment in a review that mentioned they are GOOD FOR ITEMS THAT DON'T REQUIRE PADDING. Oh well...I send lots of stuff and can definitely use these, just for other things than I originally planned. They are not white, but that's OK, the adhesive is very effective, and they are tough enough to add a moisture resistant protective skin to anything your'e mailing...just no padding."
3,Not white as advertised,"Was disappointed when I received these - they were GRAY, not white. Wish I'd spent a bit more and ordered bubble mailers instead (although postage for these is cheaper than bubble mailers for me)."
5,Good poly mailer,"Good poly mailers - pretty run of the mill, but they get the job done! I will buy these again when I need more mailers."
4,Great gift!,I bought this book for my mother in law just before her trip to Italy and she loved it. She said she used it as a resource there and it was very interesting. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't something I would buy for myself but my mother in law adored it to pieces! Great gift for any Italian or someone planning to visit Italy.
4,A handy guide for both prayers and places,"Although my wife and I have been unable to travel to Europe, We found the book to be both interesting and informative. Each shrine listed in the book described why one should attend (ie. Marian apparition, Eucharistic miracle, the relics of a saint, etc.) I think the addresses of points of contact will make planning a trip and attending a shrine much easier. The traditional Catholic prayers were contained at the end of each section useful for strip map. On the down side, there was very little Latin, the official language of the church. Also the pilgramidge from Paris to the Chartes Cathedral for the restoration of the Tridentine Mass was not mentioned either. (Last year it was attended by about 30,000 mostly young people). I have given one copy of this book to my brother and another to my parents. I wish the author would write a book on the shrines and pilgramidges of North America."
5,Awesome Documentary,"I watched the documentary and loved it. I thought it was well made and well told about how the world got Stone Cold Steve Austin. I never knew who how many other names he went by before Stone Cold. How every name and thing he dealt with started to make his own true character come alive, then Stone Cold was born! I never knew he had to endure so much pain to keep his fame alive. I never knew he had the greatest rivalry with the Rock for the top man in the company for so long. This doc told me everything I wanted to know and more. I'll recommend this!"
4,STONE COLD! STONE COLD!,"Great DVD set of Stone cold Steve Austin's career! Love the new commentary by Steve and Jim Ross on a couple of his greatest matches! Wish they would have done it for all the matches on here! If your a fan of Stone cold Steve Austin,this DVD set is a must-have for you!"
5,WOW,"This is easily one of the best WWE releases I've purchased. The documentary alone runs over two and a half hours, and discs 2 and 3 are full of great matches. I recently reviewed the nWo Revolution blu-ray, and there is just a passion on display here that's been lacking on recent WWE releases. We purchase these releases for the documentaries, and their recent trend of docs running an hour or less is pathetic. Save your money on Attitude Era or nWo Revolution and just get this one, you won't regret it."
5,GREAT DVD SET,This was a a gift for my brother for Christmas.. He loves it!! For $20 it was well worth the money it has for discs which he watched all say Christmas day and will continue to watch many more times! The item had said it was backordered so I didnt think it would get here by Christmas but it came at least a week before..
4,Stone Cold Review,This is a great product if you are interested in learning about the career of stone cold. The first disc is a great documentary on the career of stone cold. Discs two and three have some of stone cold's career defining matches. And the fourth disc is packed full of bonus footage. The one critique I have of this product is that discs two and three could have featured more matches from his career. But overall this is the perfect DVD set for the stone cold fan.
5,Fast read; good cozy,"I enjoyed this book. The characters are not well developed, but they are pleasant to read about."
3,Consider the homeschool alternative,"As an educator, I enjoyed the book and felt it isan excellent resource for parents. I was disappointed, how-ever, in Hall's approach to the alternative of homeschooling.The movement in that area should be seen as a parentalright to choose the best education for their children.In the book, (page 176) the disadvantages of homeschoolingare listed but little research is conducted on how parentsaccommodate their needs. Homeschool groups in our areahold classes with teachers, play sports, form bands, and socialize withhundreds of others. The grass roots movement of homeschoolingis a worthy alternative. The public school system in our areahas now lost some much money to this movement they are sendingout slick advertisements to try to offer part time enrollmentto the hundreds of students that left the public system.So far, the homeschooled students are too busy with homeschooling peers to notice."
1,have not received this prooduct and it's Dec 7th,"I hate to tell Amazon but this product has not been received as promised prior to November 30th. I think you should suspened any dealings with this merchant. And, this was to be a Christmas gift for my 96 year old mother.I am angry; and I hate to be angry.Jim MessnerNew Holland, PA"
2,Froese's guitar noodlings ruin it,"Simplistic, repetitive, ultra-boring quasi bluesy guitar noodlings by the Great Edgar Froese weave in and out of this experimental soundscape and basically ruin it for me. Honestly, I'm a totally self-taught guitarist, and he sounds like what I used to play when I was sixteen years old and trying to do my Jimmy Page impersonations. Staccato one note riffs that slide up and down the scales are just downright bad, and Froese didn't have the chops back then to pull it off. He certainly got better with time (listen to him on Stratosfear) but this effort is just annoyingly, cloyingly hard to listen to."
2,not what i had hoped,"as a fan of most of the krautrock records i've heard i was anxious to finally check out this cd reissue. the old version on sequel was impossible to find. once i gave it a listen i realized i'd have to ignore the julian cope hyperbole liner notes. this disc simply doesn't live up to the hype. the recording is very high end and brittle. that, in itself, could be overlooked if the group's excursions jelled once in a while. what you get is weak saucerful of secrets keyboards and pretty uninteresting faust/velvets fuzz tone guitar. the whole thing struck me as really disjointed. this music works when there are sympathetic performences and some kind of intuitive connection between the players. this disc seems like a 3 guys playing at each other. true, the sounds are there, but they never jell convincingly. save your cash for ash ra tempel or faust."
2,a website would be more useful,"This is not the sort of book that people are likely to read, cover to cover, as though it were a novel or classroom text. [Though for the latter, how many actually do anyway?]It is a continuing puzzle why books like these get printed. Given its subject, it would seem far better for Hudson or his publisher to simply maintain a website with the information. Which could be kept up to date and offer rich searching options. Whereas for the latter, any book only has an index. Plus, the website can of course link to the many Internet sources it cites. More convenient for the reader."
1,Redundant,"Don't be fooled by the new cover and liner notes. This DVD is nothing more than a repackaging of the ""Black Sabbath Story Vol. 2"" collection (transferred very obviously from a grainy, worn-out VHS copy) with the 4 songs from the ""Musikladen"" set tacked on. The only possible advantage to this is that unlike the official ""Vol. 2"" DVD, the set is presented in its original aspect ratio rather than the forced ""letterboxed"" ratio, but that's hardly worth the list price given the dreadful video quality. If you don't have either the ""Vol. 2"" or ""Musikladen"" discs, and don't mind the fuzz and grain (or a shrill, echo-laden 5.1 remix), then by all means, jump on this one. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,My son would give this 5 stars,"My 18 month old loves Noddy. I can barely stand it, mostly because of the gaudy computer animation. But the kid loves it, and the stories are fairly harmless. At least this collection gives me some new episodes to watch. There are old stop-motion Noddy episodes on YouTube that are much better, but you can't get those on DVD here in the U.S.Thankfully the kid seems to be moving on to Toy Story and Thomas the Tank Engine."
3,great classics,I am 71 and this brought back great memories of my younger days..it would be a great inspiration for the youth of today
3,Would be nice to know the constituents,"I would like to know what form of COQ10 is in the product. I have a bottle of it, but nowhere on the label does it say which form of COQ10 it contains -- ubiquinone or the more absorbable version, ubiquinol. I assume that since it does not divulge that information, it must contain the cheaper version, i.e., ubiquinone."
1,Not good,"When I finaly gave this as the gift I purchased it for I had to explain that I bought it online and didn't know what I was getting. It was embarrasing, I was trying to go for something chik to give from one mom to another. Ha ha it would only hold like one diaper and it was a cheap plastic material! Oh well"
2,Get 4th Edition,"This is the first edition, and there seem to be lot of errors. The author's web site states that there is a 4th edition available. I'd wait for that one."
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought a number of Schaum's Outline books simultaneously. Problem is you do not know what you are getting. The Discrete Math book for example is exceptionally good.On the other side of the equation .. this book.. It gives a high level overview of a hodgepodge of topics, but none of the treatment was in a structure or level of detail useful for either using it or trying to even answer interview questions."
2,This level isn't level,"I only have one data point considering that I bought one level, but the manufacturer specifies this level to be accurate to 0.0005"" per inch. I rested one end of the level on a fixed point, set the bubble carefully to the middle and made a mark at the other end of the level. Then I flipped the level over and repeated the same process several times. I consistently got an error of 0.001"" per inch. While this might not sound like much, it means that over the 48 inches length of this level, you are off by 0.048"". If you are trying to put a line around a room that's level, you could easily accumulate a full inch of error. I don't know if this is normal or not, but I am not very impressed. Maybe I don't understand the intent of this tool well enough?"
3,"Good book, but don't buy it.","This book is decently written and has lots of good information; however, there is a lot that is left out. Also, the pictures could use arrows to demonstrate the moves better. The author has written two other more recent books on the subject which greatly improve on the first. Buy one of those."
4,Just what I expected,Never a disappointment when it comes to Ms. Telesco. She writes well and clearly and always has something interesting to say.
4,it's hot ......,"Big ups to da fam for puttin it down.Dem boyz are definently on the cuttin edge of brangin holy hip hop and r&p to da forefront for the world to see that we can brang da get down as we keep it KRUNK fa CHRIST .......ALSO... ..STAY TUNED FOR DAT HOLY HIP HOP VOL.3 cd SCHEDULED TO COME OUT OCTOBER 25th 2005.and also BIGGA BELLY DA FIX TAPE vol 1 as well as MOBIGGA's certified platinum plus debut LP titled ""START SOMETHIN""....to hear these artists"
5,Hot but stable.,"When you use this remember to get adequate air cooling around your memory banks. I used this in my Supermicro X7DAL-E motherboard.I highly recommend getting 4 chips in any Intel 5000 chipset because two sticks only give you half the maximum bandwidth.I would not purchase 533Mhz memory because with Intel's current price wars with AMD you should be able to purchase a 1333FSB for a low price in the coming months. Without 667FSB ram, you can't get the full benefit of the faster bus speed."
2,The Best??? Really???,"I only purchased this item because of the 1982 NFC Championship Game, the only game from this set worth watching. The NFL needs to get with the program. NFL fans want to see the classics games, The years when Brent Musberger stated ""you are looking live"" and CBS carried the NFC games. With the 1982 game, I now own the original broadcasts of all 3 consecutive Cowboys Championship losses, 1980-1982. As a ny Giant fan, that's awesome!!!"
2,Poor Audio,"Take That is a great group, however the Audio on this DVD is pathetic to say the least. I find it surprising, that they allowed this to be marketed. The audio is so unprofessionally recorded. Normally, live recordings are done through the main board and mixed down from there, but this sounds like they just placed mics all over and it's all slammed together."
3,"Long on sound, short on life","I've had these wireless headphones for about a month and like them very much with one glaring exception which cost them 2 stars. The sound is very good and they are reasonably confortable, they do a good job of blocking out outside noise as well, which is a plus.I use these at work in a bull-pen environment and the wireless feature makes them extremely nice because I can walk away from my desk still wearing the headphones with no degradation in sound.An interesting aside is that the microwave interferes with the sound which is understandable.It looses 2 stars because it is a battery hog. I am averaging around 25 hours per set of batteries. I have a co-worker that bought a set after I bought mine and he has a similar problem so it is not unique to my set."
2,Nice idea - I wish they worked better,"These work just the way they're supposed to as long as I'm sitting directly in front of the computer (close enough to use wired headphones). If I walk 10 feet away, I get lots of static. I still get sound, but it's annoyingly poor quality. It comes back when I walk back to the computer. I bought these so I could use them in my lab and most of my time will be spent across the room from the computer. If I knew the sound would start cutting out after 10 feet, I would have gone with a different brand. Very disappointing."
2,very uncomfortable,"Good sound quality, but very uncomfortable to wear. I felt it very hard on my head. If you are not very young and want comfort, this item is definitely not for you.I returned it without any hesitations."
3,A pleasant story.,"Back Cover description: A business proposal&#65533;or more? Meeting Dr. Roele van Dyke was a blessing for Emma Dawson. He always seemed to go out of his way to make her happy, and she couldn&#65533;t imagine life without him&#65533;.And when the time came for Roele to return to Amsterdam permanently, he knew he couldn&#65533;t leave Emma behind. So he offered her a job at his surgery. Emma was in love and simply couldn&#65533;t refuse. But did Roele want Emma to be his secretary or his wife?A nice, pleasant Betty Neels story. Emma is not a nurse; she is taking care of her whiny, selfish mother. The mother is almost too much to take, but thankfully she is gone by the halfway point. Emma has no skills, so it is not easy for her to get jobs she can make money at. Roele is in love with her by page 72. The rest of the book follows along the same route that Ms. Neels always uses, but hey&#65533;it&#65533;s why I read these"
1,I can't believe this was published in 2001,This book was supposed to have been published in 2001. I felt as if I was reading a book published in the 40's or 50's. The characters were not believable at all. People in England do not talk like this in the 2000's. Waste of my money. I would have liked to have given it 0 star (but couldn't) due to how too old-fashion the whole writing was for the year 2000.
2,Fragile even without beign used,"I collect prehistoric marine reptiles figures. I bought this one because it represents a Metriorhynchus, a species rarely seen in toy form. The figure was produced in 2005, so the goo in which the figure is covered had hardened so I had to wash it only to discover that the figure's right arm was peeling, and no, I don't mean the paint. I'm not sure if it's because of the white goo it was covered for seven years or just bad quality material, since I also bought Maelstrom (which is inside blue goo), other figure from this line and it doesn't have the same problem. The 2 inch figure is nicely done and accurate to the character it represents but it's made of rubbery soft plastic, so I don't think is good for playing."
3,It's aight...,"This cd is aight, but Luke was better with 2 Live Crew. If you want to hear booty-bass explicit sh*t that grooves, check out 2 Live Crew's greatest hits CD or anything from DJ Boss Pimp."
3,missing his best song ever,This CD does NOT have Hydraulics on it! How is it going to be a greatest hits cd without the one song that everyone in the world knows him for?
1,Like a Dictionary,This book is almost like reading a dictionary. Every once in a while there is an interesting entry but most ways to say I love you are mundane. Aren't there any creative romantics out there?
3,"Some good ideas, but there are better books","I'm glad I checked this book out of the library. There were some good ideas that I made note of, but Godek forgot himself and repeated a couple of ideas (where was the editor?). He also recycled ideas that appear in some of his other books. I agree with the reviewer who recommends Creative Romance (Doug Fields), instead. (Haven't read that reviewer's other suggestion, The RoMANtic's Guide, but I subscribe to Michael Webb's RoMANtic Tips newsletter, and if the book is anything like the newsletter, it should be worth your money.)"
4,Fun Book,"This is a really fun book. I bought this to give to my husband as a gift and we have gone through and marked all the numbers that we have done. I only have a few complaints...the author often uses quotes and song titles included into his 10,000 number. Granted, I don't blame him but it's kind of cheating."
5,A WONDERFUL book!,"I bought this book a while back as a reference book for unique and creative ideas. I fell in love with the book because it is full of things that I've never thought of doing and I consider myself to be a creative person when it comes to relationships. I love this book so much that I've bought copies and given them to at least 6 different friends and couples. They too loved the book. This makes a great gift for couples. While the book is intended for romantic relationships, I think that EVERYONE will find something useful in this book for any relationship. This book is definitely a winner!"
4,Pretty good,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a great book for the price=10000 ideas for $10. That's not even a penny apiece. There are a lot of ideas that are definately not what I'd consider romantic (buy them life insurance), but there are some in there that are. If it only costs you 10 bucks to do something nice for the one you love,then this is a great book, but don't expect it to be packed full of gems. Maybe you could both go through with highlighters so you can find the good ones later. I do have to say that you're pretty much guaranteed to find something you like with so many ideas listed. Fun to flip to for a quick idea or something to laugh about. Many many lists of romantic movies, songs, etc."
4,"Lots of great ideas, but....","I loved going through this book. There are tons of great ideas, a lot I had never thought of. There were some that seem like common sense in a loving relationship. What I didn't like was there was a LOT of repetition of ideas and a lot of ideas for millionaires. Sorry, but a unlimited shopping spree on Rodeo Drive or hopping a Concorde to Paris are just not in my budget. But, there were some cool phrases you could say in different languages and lots of romantic movie and song ideas. I definately recommend getting this book."
3,modern world needs it,"don't you think it dull when some one repeatedly says""i love you""in a unchangable way,this book will help those who are a little bit stubbon on express themselves."
2,7000 Ideas Too Many,"Greg has some good ideas in his book but it seems like he was really stretching to come up with 10,000. It is hard to find the good ideas through the thousands of useless ones."
5,"Good value, no frills.","The item was exactly what was advertised, a no frills bicycle seat for a good price. Make sure you take good measurements of the seat you need in order to avoid confusion. I took a guess and had to install the seat post upside down. It works great and the post is long enough to fit a variety of sizes for people."
3,Okay but not LED,Not bad and I like the adjustable prongs and the storeage reel.However I wish it used an LED not just a 6v bulb.
4,Party-Time Nearly Sunk Beem,"This is a great story of life on the PGA Tour. It's also a story of a common man ""who made it big"" by winning tour events and a major.But he was also a man who was immature and who nearly lost it all by partying too much. The good news: he eventually realized it and cleaned up his behavior.I have never understood the ""let's party all the time"" and ""get blasted every night"" mentality. But it's sold to us every waking minute by beer commercials as the way to be the hippest, and coolest person around. Tragedies just waiting to happen, and Rich Beem came very close to being one. Drink up!"
4,So far so good,"Still reading, but thus far book is entertaining. It jumps around a bit, I guess necessary to tell both Rich Beem's back story before he went pro and Steve Duplantis'(Beem's caddie) and how the two ended up together. Didn't realize Steve Duplantis tragically passed away since book was written."
2,Raw/Honest,"I went to high school with Rich and even knew him at university. This book is a very raw/honest look at Rich and Steve. I admire his honesty and how open he was in sharing his rookie year.I'm not sure I could ever look at Rich the same way, but I know that I will always wish him great success. He is an amazing golfer."
1,small and flimsy!,"This looks nice in the picture, but it is terribly small and flimsy! It is awfully cheap-- I'm afraid it will bend if I touch it too hard! Suitable for a baby's bracelet only!"
4,Does not fit without some minor modification,"The brackets do not drop far enough for my Infiniti QX4. I had to remove some smaller brackets and bolts to get this to fit. Having a degree in design engineering I would strongly recommend another 1"" drop from the bolt holes, and a slightly larger diameter on the two bottom access holes. It does fit and is a very sturdy design. It just requires a lot of effort to get this installed. Great price, and looks great!"
1,Well it is not what I hoped.,A little bit of his life and lots of close ups on the field during a game.Very little really almost none of his of his skills.
1,Film of poor quality (NOT WORKING),"Messrs was eager to get this movie my favorite player, I was surprised to see that the bluray disc player, not fully served, the menus did not work, I could not see the comments, as was done, etc ... all submenus, options, etc ... that brings the movie apart, do not work. Service and product, lousy ...I wish I could return this disk. and receive a quality I expected for $ 20Bye..."
5,A Microcosm of the Greatest Footballer Since Pele,"Zidane's unique, incomparable style was captured by this documentarian during a Spanish League match while he played for Real Madrid. Basically, throughout the match, the cameras (all of them) never stop focusing on the midfield maestro as the team's attack constantly flows through this graceful player. Zidane will be an enduring example of a true rarity in the sports world: a player whose presence makes every player around him better than what they would normally be. Zidane didn't dominate every match by taking every shot for his team. Zidane wasn't constantly shouting commands at teammates. He led through example and controlled the pace of the game and more often than not, created shot opportunities for teammates. However, he was a deadly scorer in his own right. This documentary is a terrific microcosm of the man, the player - Zidane."
1,didn't know I could have just DVR'd the game.,"Ok, maybe I'm a bit early in posting, but I am 30 minutes in and I am really upset by this. It literally is just camera's following Zidane around the field, he doesn't talk during play which makes it boring, there isn't commentary. Hopefully at some point this picks up and I am forced to edit this rating, but as for now, I wasted my money."
3,Does not work for Vista HCX,This item says it will work for the Vista but the back will not work for the Vista HCX. Save a couple of bucks and get the rail mount by itself. The Vista HCX comes with a clip that will fit the rail mount but I didn't know where I put my so I bought the kit. I had to find my clip since the back would not fit my HCX due to the memory card slot.
4,Garmin Bicycle Mount Bracket for eTrex and Summit,The bracket and back cover are OK. The lock mechanism - metal T-shaped pin locked into Garmin's plastic body does not look solid for agressive mountain riding. I'm afraid it will break up after awhile.
2,Not for HCx,This product does not work with Garmin's Etrex Legend HCx. The replacement cover does not fit the HCx because it will not ffit over the mini SD card. I used only the handlebar piece and had to order (from another source) the clip that screws to the back of my GPS.
1,Didn't fit eTrex 20,"Once again, the description said that it would fit the eTrex 20 and it most certainly did not! Really disappointed!"
4,works great,"This product works great. It's been very sturdy (though I haven't taken in mountain biking yet). Other reviewers and I share a common complaint- the back is hard to secure with the twisting lock. Careful use of needlenose pliers takes care of that, though. Besides, even with the mounting back my e-Trex still fits in the neoprene case, so I don't have to switch the backs unless I'm going to change batteries."
4,"Good, but...","This bracket is quite sturdy and the GPS is held firmly in place. Works perfect on my bicycle. The only problem is vibration is transfered from you handlebar directly to the GPS, so if I try to use it on my enduro motorbike (KTM) the unit turns off when the riding gets hard. For high vibration environments there are other alternatives (Touratech)"
1,Wrong product in package group,Ordered an eTrex 30 and amazon offered a package deal to include the bike mount and carrying case. Got this bike mount and it did not fit the Garmin eTrex 30 (you have to remove the back plate on the device and replace it with the one provided with the mount). Garmin website offers the correct mount.
1,Will not fit,"I ordered an eTrex 20, case and bicycle mount in a package, however, the mount will not fit the eTrex 20-not even close. I went on the Garmin web site and got the part number for the correct mount and reordered from Amazon. I hope this on fits the 20."
2,mount,HelloI purchased this so I could mount my etrex to my road bike. The mount would not fit around the handle bar so I had to attach the mount to the bike using some zip tie's.I think it would fit my mountain bike just fine.Kevin
3,Not for eTrex Venture CX either,"As mentioned by some other reviewers, this item does not work with any of the Garmin units with an SD slot. Other than that...it's exactly what I was looking for. I made modifications on my own so that the back cover would work, but that eliminated any seal that might have been present."
3,works but need a little something,"I bought this to use in my motorcycle,mounts very easy,but the backplate doesnt have any type of cushion for the batteries,so if you have it on and it a bump it causes the gps to go off,then it takes a while for the gps to callibrate,and just when it starts working good,bump.I cut small peices of foam and inserted between the batteries and the back and it helps the problem alot."
3,Does not fit Etrex with SD cards,Also you lose the rubber gasket when you replace the original cover with the cover the mount attaches to.The mount does its job but if being waterproof is a necessity find something else.
3,issues,dont know if its the gps or the mount but with this mounted on mountain bike handlebars it sometimes vibrates enough that the batteries come loose and it shuts off. stays on well though
3,doesn't fit eTrex Legend cx,Please note that you do not need to purchase this if you want to attach your eTrex GPS to your bike or motorcycle handlebars. Just purchase the Large Diameter Rail mount adapter (for larger bars - I have a HD Dyna) and use the GPS mount adapter that comes with your GPS. The back plate included in the Bicycle Mount kit does not fit the Garmin eTrex Legend cx GPS device.
3,Doesn't work with eTrex Vista HCx,"Would probably work great, but just a word of warning that it will not work with a eTrex Vista HCx, even though it appears to be the proper shape. I found out the hard way."
5,many other uses besides bikes,"I actually use this in my 98 Caravan. The gear shift is on the steering column, as is the case with many vans or pick-ups. When the shifter is in ""D"", it puts the GPS at the perfect location both for visiblity and ease of use. I think an actual dash mount would make it too hard to read or use. Also, don't forget to check out the auto power adapter. When you run the eTrex on external power, you can keep the light on all the time. This is great when you are driving at night."
4,"Well, with a simple fix it's a great product","I've had this for 8 months or so and I like it. But the bike mount has a major flaw. The battery cover has a very loose fit with the main unit. It got so bad that it managed to turn off the GPS on a ride over a fairly smooth road.Here's the fix. Two pieces of electrical tape. I wrapped one piece around the bottom of the battery case and one around the top (this required scissors to trim the tape). I don't know how this affects the waterproofing, but the battery case grips the GPS like a limpit and everything works 100% better now."
3,Does not fit Garmin etrex Vista hcx without mods...,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this. The model number for the mount (even on the Garmin website) says if will fit the garmin etrex vista hcx. However the garmin etrex vista hcx has a memory card right along the left site, if you are looking at the back.If you have an exacto knife or even better a dremel tool you can rout out the plastic on the provided cover to add enough clearance for the cover to be installed.Once the cover it modified it can fit and function as it should."
1,Bad Design!,"Put simply, this case was badly designed for mountain bikers! I sold mine 2 weeks after buying it.Why is it bad?The whole gps is supported by the bottom battery case, which in turn is supported by a tiny metal hinge in the case. With all the vibrations in mountain biking, the hinge will eventually become loose and perhaps the batteries may come loose. I've heard of batteries coming loose from other users and the gps loosing power!Garmin needs to design a holder that holds the entire gps body rather than the battery cover only.Bottom line : NEVER get this for mountain biking. It might perhaps be a little less damaging in road biking."
1,doesn't fit Garmin eTrex Legend Cx,I purchased the bicycle mount for my Garmin eTrex Legend Cx and it doesn't fit! The back is made for some other model.
2,Jake,"Unfortunately, it does not fit OS sized road handlebars (31.8 mm bars). Basically, its a worthless lump of plastic to me."
3,Eventually worked for me. Not HCx compatible.,"Pros: Price, ease of use, good grip.Cons: Not compatible with HCxI had to dremmel out some of the battery lid to make it fit my HCx because the memory card slot is raised a little. It's still a tight fit, but I'm worried if I shave more off, it will drill through and won't be waterproof anymore.After the surgery, it works well. I installed it on my KLR 650 off road motorcyle, and I believe it will work well for me."
1,Don't fit,Don't not fit my garmin (at all) as described. Garmin eTrex vista HCx color is the one I have and it will not fit.
4,Bit pricey but works well,"Appears to be well made. Easy to fit. I won't give it 5 stars though, because I think that $12 is a lot of of money for a small plastic bracket and a slightly modified battery compartment cover, especially when the eTrex only cost me $108 over five years ago."
3,"Bike rail circumference matters, mount might not fit your bike","I bought it for mounting the eTrex Vista Garmin GPS onto the bike rails, but the rails turned out too thick and the mount didn't fit. Had to buy the adapter to make it fit."
2,Worked good for a few rides,"Installed on my ATV and worked great for a few rides, then after a while it started getting looser and looser from wear, I may have to order another one soon because i dont want my gps falling off!"
1,Does not fit!,"This item does not fit the HCx. The cover interfears with the SD card. I returned the cover and Amazon sent me another one. It was the exact same cover. After receiving two of them, I relized that the cover was hitting the case where the SD card goes. I was able to grind out the cover to make it work. Most people will not have the tools or skills to perform this task. Amazon should remove the HCx from the list of GPS's that it will fit, the box it comes in does not list HCx ."
2,Bike mount used on Garmin Vista Cx,"This did not fit my GPS. My vista cx has a micro sd card mount on the left side of the battery case. The back for this did not have a notch going around it, so it would not attach to the GPS. I dug out my dremel and cut out a notch in the back in order to get it to fit.If you are looking to have this fit your vista cx, or any other garmin hand held that has the memory card mounted next to the batteries, make sure that you are able to modify the mount to go around the memory card if your gps is set up that way. Not all are, but mine is, so this had to be modified to fit. Be aware as this is NOT a universal bike mount for all the garmin hand held GPS units listed in the description. You may need to modify the case in order for it to fit your GPS."
3,Warning if you have the HCx with the SDcard,"I got the bracket and HCx for Christmas. Be sure to use the bracket/clip that comes with the Garmin HCx unit. This is an adapter. The plate that comes with the bracket will not fit on the back of the Garmin, because of the SD card bulge. The HCx has a little bulge in the rear plate for the SD card. The plate that comes with the bracket is for the eTrex HC series that DO NOT HAVE the SD card. Therefore IT WON'T WORK FOR THE HCx!! The bulge on the unit prevents the cover plate from fitting. Again use the little adapter that comes in with the Garmin itself."
4,If you own a eTrex Vista HCx Do NOT Buy!,"If you are thinking of purchasing this bike mount to use with a Garmin eTrex Vista HCx, don't do it. The new battery panel does not fit on the Vista HCx. I just printed my return label and sealed the box to send it back to Amazon. The quality of the item is great(4 stars), but for Amazon not being more clear about compatibility(-1 star)."
3,make sure it's gonna work!,"I got this item because I have a Garmin etrex Vista HCX. Based on the description for this item I purchased it. Unfortunately, this item does not work with the HCX only the lesser models. So the bar bracket works, but the new battery cover will not work with my eTrex. Four extra $$ and now I have to find a backing plate as well! Other than that it probably works just fine..."
1,NOT for etrex Legend HCx,"BEWARE BUYER! This item will not fit the Garmin eTrex Legend HCx GPS unit. I bought the GPS, holder, memory cards, and bike mount from Amazon.com in December as a Christmas present. Mountain biking season started this week and when I tried to install the mount on my bike the back did NOT fit my GPS unit. I found out to my dismay that I should have read the one star reviews! A small plastic adapter came with the GPS unit that will work with the bike mount but didn't know what it was for until I read one star reviews."
1,Won't fit eTrex Vista HCx,"Bought this for my newer eTrex Vista HCx and does not work. The Back case is larger on the HCx model because of the memory card you plug in..They come with the clip..so now I have to buy Just the Handle Bar Mount..Gave the unit to my Brother,who I'ld sold my other GPS to...fit it like a charm."
4,This mount doesn't work on the newer vista gps,"The mount itself is an excellent item however, if you do not have the screw in adapter for the back of your Vista GPS x model it will work. the problem is that the extra room that the slot for the memory card takes prevents the back cover from fitting correctly. I am sure you could notch it out to fit but that would compromise the seal. It also would not look nice as the cover is smaller than the unit itself. I was fortunate to have the screw adapter for both of our units. Plan on heading out on the bikes to geocache after church tomorrow."
3,Garmin Bike Mount for eTrex Review,Great bike mount. It holds the GPS pretty steady.Don't buy this set if you use eTrex HCx coz the battery case cover that comes with the mount is totally worthless.
4,Secure bike mount,Easy to mount. Secure - I have mounts for my road and mountain bikes. The only shortcoming is that there is no adapter for oversize handle bars or for the bicycle stem. These options would substantially increase the options for mounting.
1,Wrong size for Vista HCx,Doesn't feet Vista HCx. I had no idea that Garmin Vista's are not the same size - no information anywhere. Garmin support doesn't answer emails.
1,Back for bike mount does not fit HCx,"The handlebar bracket does not fit the HCx because of the sd slot.Bought it for the bike, now what?"
2,Dosen't fit units with Micro SD card,I have an eTrex Vista Hcx with a micro SD card slot. This mount is not designed to fit around the card slot.
2,BACK COVER DOES NOT WORK ON ALL LISTED MODELS,THE MOUNT WORKS FINE THE ONLEY THING IS THAT THE BACK COVER ONLEY WORKS ON THE-VENTURE- MODEL --NONE OF THE OTHER MODELS
1,It does not work for a etrex venture CX,What a disappointment. The battery cover does not work on a eTrex Venture CX model. What a disappointment. The CX has a flash card slot on the upper left which requires a notch in the cover. This one does not have the notch so it will not fit. I also do not have the o-ring mentioned by the other reviewer so I am not sure if it will seal 100% on regular units anyway.What a bummer I threw away the packaging before I actually tried to mount it on the bicycle anyway. What a bummer.
4,This DOES work with the eTrex Vista,"I, like many reviewers, was disappointed when I saw that the back cover provided with the mount does not fit on the eTrex Vista. Then I saw a helpful comment to one of the people complaining about this not working with the Vista. You need to screw on the mounting attachment that came with eTrex Vista. This then fits snugly on the provided mount. You don't need the provided back at all. In many ways this is better than using the back that came with the bike mount. The original back is waterproof and much sturdier than the plastic back that came with the mount. I attached it to my bike and it performed well. The only reason for four stars is I don't like paying for a back that I don't need.I thought that this bit of knowledge was important enough to put it in its own review and not be buried in a comment. My thanks to the person who commented about how this mount works with the Vista."
3,"Works, but cost is too high","I got this to work with my Vista CX on my bike. It does work, but only the bar clamp itself is needed for that model of GPS. The Vista CX comes with a fitting to use with the stock battery-pack cover that is better than the one you get with this clamp. I was warned that the replacement battery cover that comes with this will not allow space for the sd card, and since the GPS is useless without it, that's no good. Also, the stock cover is rubberized to keep water out, which this one is not. Don't use this battery cover, use the one that comes with the CX. Maybe other models require this battery cover and don't interfere with the memory cards.So, the package costs more than it should for users with this gps. I got a second one directly from Garmin for less, since it only had the clamp. To be fair, though, this clamp puts the GPS futher forward on the bar than the other one I got, which keeps it out of the way of your knee when climbing out of the saddle."
3,Half works perfect,"As stated in many other reviews the new battery back mount won't fit on Micro SD Garmins without altering it yourself. But the part that attaches to your bicycle works great. My Garmin came with a screw-on attachment so I didn't need the new back and everything worked out fine.If you have the little screw on mount that should have come with Garmin originally then this mount will work for you, if not don't bother."
1,False advertising - Does not fit Vista Cx,"Even on the package it states that it is made for eTrex Vista and it is designed by Garmin. Is it possible they don't know their own product? Some one should pay for this, Ah I forgot that is me.....Garmin Bicycle Mount for eTrex and Summit (010-10267-00)"
2,DOES NOT FIT NEW ETREX 10-20-30 Models,This item says it will fit Etrex Series GPS but it will NOT fit the new Etrex 10-20-30 Models.It is designed to fit the older Legend and other models only.
3,WARNING -- does not fit Venture Cx!,"It may work fine for other Garmin E-Trex models, but it does NOT fit the yellow Venture Cx. The Micro-SD compartment in the battery case makes it a slightly different shape, and the lockplate won't fit. Bummer! (Anyone want to buy mine used? :)"
3,Mount does not fit Vista HCx,The mounting kit looks good and is simple enough. However the back will not fit the Garmin Vista HCx with the memory card next to the batteries.
5,Works great on my dirtbike,I have mine mounted on my Suzuki DRZ400 that I mainly use for off-road. This has been great. I have used it on a few rides that have been very rocky and caused a lot of vibration. I haven't had any problems with it the GPS shutting off due to vibration and the mount has held strong. I have even dropped the bike and hit the GPS on the ground and the mount didn't break. I would recommend this to anyone without reservation.
2,Does NOT work with eTrex Legend Hcx,"I was under the impression (it may have been Amazon's fault) that it would work with my Legend. The replacement back does not fit since the Legend takes micro SD cards. Luckily, I also have a windshield mount that fits into the bracket so I will keep it."
5,Very sturdy product,"I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse, hits on the ground, vibrations, etc. Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike."
1,"Completely useless for Etrex 20, as advertised.","This handlebar mount bracket, shown as accessory for the E-trex 20 Garmin GPS is useless for this GPS model. It does not fit the GPS at all, as it is impossible to mount the GPS on it."
1,warning!!!! doesnt fit vista HCx,"This product says it fits eTrex Vista, eTrex H but doesnt tell you that it doesnt fit etrex HCx.I just wasted some money, Stay away if you own an etrex Vista HCx."
3,Doesn't fit the HCx version of eTrex Vista,My eTrex includes a mirco sd card. The card slot prevents this battery cover from fitting. At $15 I just grinded the cover to make it fit. Not what I would suggest for others. For the right version of eTrex this would be a good product.
3,Does Not Fit Garmin eTrex Vista HCx,"Good, secure mounting system but does not fit on the eTrex Vista HCx. Backplate is not formed correctly to accommodate the memory card slot."
1,Doesn't Work for Garmin eTrex Vista HCx,"Garmin or eBay (whoever will take responsibility) fails to disclose that the eTrex Vista HCx has a different contour on the back of the unit, making it incompatible with the alleged ""universal"" bike mount. BEWARE"
1,Does not fit eTrex Legend,This product mislead me to believe it fit my eTrex Legend. The back piece is not shaped to accommodate the microSD card slot.
2,"For motorcycles, get a Ram Mount instead...","If you are mounting on a motorcycle/atv or doing rough mountain biking, save youself the aggravation and just get the Ram Mount. The Garmin mount is much too flimsy and will eventually vibrate loose. Also, since it only attaches to the battery door, the vibration frequently causes the batteries to break contact resulting in the unit shutting off...very annoying. This was confirmed by Garmin tech. support who actually steered me toward the Ram. It's built like a tank, fully adjustable and holds the unit rock solid."
1,This item does not fit Garmin eTrex Venture Cx!!,"I bought this item as an accessory for my Garmin eTrex Venture Cx. I found a link to this handlebar mount in the accessories section in the Garmin eTrex Venture Cx product description. This led me to believe that the two items were compatible - this turned out not to be true!The battery cover does not fit, due to the memory card slot on the Venture Cx GPS (the GPS unit is a bit to wide here). However the handlebar mount still fit the GPS, using the (rather fragile) clip that came with the product.The appropriate accessories for this unit can be found via Garmin, but is not sold by Amazon at the time of writing.I have given this item one star, because it was not what I expected when I bought it, and that I was mislead by the false links."
2,Garmin needs a redesign,"I know it's been said by other reviewers, but the cover does have a problem with vibration and shutting the unit off. I bought 2 mounts for my mountain and road bikes and both turn off almost every time I ride. It doesn't need to be a hard jolt and it seems to happen frequently on downhills when you loose the most data frantically trying to turn the thing back on without crashing. On the plus side, though, the mount does seem very sturdy and I have no fear of the GPS falling off. I just wish Garmin designed the thing better so the batteries didn't rattle around so much."
1,Battery Mount does not Fix Vista HCx,The battery mount does not fit the Vista HCx because of the micro SD mount. The description is misleading because is lists model as being compatible. Many people have noted this in comments and the description should be rewritten.
1,Does not fit Etrex 20,"It should be noted that despite the fact that this unit is advertised as an Etrex handlebar mount, it dies not fit the 20 model. The package comes with a replacement battery cover, which then clips onto the handlebar mount. The battery cover for the 20 is of a different configuration and therefore this mount does not fit. If you own the unit you can see this from the picture, however I bought both together as suggested by Amazon expecting they were compatible. Amazon - you need to be more explicit in your description."
1,mount does not fit etrex20 GPS,"Buyer beware! This handlebar mount comes recommended by Amazon to fit the etrex20 GPS, but I quickly found out it does not fit. Hopefully the seller will provide a full refund..."
1,Does not Fit the eTrex Vista HCx.,"Does not Fit the Vista HCx. Garmin said it would, Amazon said it would, but it doesn't. Might be nice if it fit."
5,THIS BOOK IS A WEAPON NOT A BAND AID,"I bought this book about 20 years ago and read it a few times and kept it as a reference manual . Great for personal use and wider to help deliver other christians . This book starts with a great testimony of the author seeking to sort out inner problems doesnt need a band aid but something that will root out his problem ....demons . I advise every christian to buy this book as it is packed full of bible teaching not just about deliverance but faith , our position in Christ , and testimonies . Its a brilliant book and needs translation to Norwegian...( hint hint) and any other language.I also bought up several copies and gave them to friends and a local Bible collegeBest Wishes and Blessings to All... , Alan"
5,GREAT BOOK!,Had read the old edition and was glad to see the book still in print. Bought several as gifts. Definitely recommend.
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY,Nextar MA323 MP3Player a DisappointmentInternal Rechargeable Battery did not work straight out of the Box regardless of 'charging' via USB. Nextar Customer Service refuses to assist/replace. No ability for buyer/user to purchase/replace battery. Poorly written User's Manual.
1,RIP OFF!,Does not work. Battery does not retain any charge whatsoever. The USB to jack port is not compatible with any other audio jack. Stay away from this product!
1,Standard Deviants,"Standard Deviants School - Chemistry, Program *** - ***** (Classroom Edition) -Please always check the Standard Deviants Shelf before you buy anything from Teaching System - the products are ONE and the SAME -The standard Deviants prices are economicalStay away from Teaching Systems"
1,Amazon messed up again,"The product picture and part number match, but they together do not math the description."
4,Great,"Although this is not what we typically see from Aerosmith, it certainly does the trick and shows the mushy side of a hard-core band."
2,I got two words for this recording...SELL OUT,"This is the worse aerosmith song i've ever heard. And i've heard them all b/c I got over 80(includes singles, imports, bootlegs etc..) of there c.d.'s. Not to mentions some of my orginal l.p.'s. But they really sold out. I saw them in concert and it ruled. Exept for them playing this damn song. If you are a real fan go by some of there great albums like pump, rocks, toys, 9 lives etc... But don't waste your dough on this or any of the imports....well maybe the imports b/c there are some cool songs on those. Okay maybe i'm a little harsh but this is the only song w/ out the fabo routine of a guitar solo. With no solo it's getting knocked down to a 2 star review."
5,The Best!,"Aerosmith is the best! Nobody can do a ballad like Steven Tyler, certainly not Mark Chesnut."
2,A Poor Sequel,I love The Initiation of PB500. However the sequel The Citadel is a disappoiontment. The slave's master turns out weak and easily manipulated in this book. Much of the book describes a series of humilation on the slave witnessed by an audience with scant desire for the slave.The plot twists and turns that lead to the slave restoring his master's dignity are not very believeable. This sequel lack the sexual tension of the slave-master relationship of the first book.
4,A PLEASANT SURPRISE.,"ACCOUSTIC TREATMENT OF TIMBUK 3 SONGS BY THE FEMALE HALF OF THE GROUP. VOICE IS SOLID. HOPE SHE'LL START WRITING NEW ORIGINALS AS HER EX-HUSBAND PAT MACDONALD HAS. SHE BE PLAYED ON MY COMMUNITY RADIO SHOW AS I'M A BIG FAN OF TIMBUK 3. IT IS TOO BAD THEY ARE CONSIDERED ""ONE HIT WONDERS"". THEY WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THAT LABEL IMPLIES."
4,Thanks Barbara K !,Great to hear these classic Timbuk 3 songs! Barbara K ---Thank You Thank You Thank You for recording these arrangements!
5,350 Classic Cartoons,My child was so happy to get this video of his favorite cartoons.A great quality of print for hours of laughter and fun.You won't be sorry when you buy this product. I was pleased.
2,Review of Nina Pastori's Maria,"I like the music but if I could hear the whole album I'm sure I'd enjoy it better. The CD is defective and I've written to titanmusic about it, but they have not replied to me!"
3,"Mix of urban history, malay legend and contemporary politics","In the guise of a book examing the growth of Kuala Lumpur(KL), the author explores Malay legends and stories for what they show about national culture, as well as discussing recent Malaysian history up to Anwar Ibrahim's show trial and imprisonment. For an outsider with some knowledge of Malaysia, the book is excellent, and challenges many assumptions about Malaysia, and its current leadership. I suspect, but do not know, that its treatment may be superficial for a more knowledgeable reader,"
2,disappointing,"it is a somehow disappointing book, sometimes superficial, never really ""deep"". Some stories in the book are nice to read, but I regret having bought the book."
5,Zimbabwe,"Peter Godwin has written a harming story of a white boy growing up under the loving, nurturing hands of native blacks (Shona) in Zimbabwe. He confirms impressions that I have had of that kind people after a couple of work experiences I had as a physician in a remote hospital there. If you want to understand more about the culture and events that led to unfortunate state of Zimbabwe today, read Mukiwa."
5,"Please, Please Read This Book!","The American press and public have entirely missed the Zimbabwe tragedy. You shouldn't. The first book you should read on the topic is this one. There are others, but if this one doesn't move you to do something, nothing will."
3,A box set too far,"This set is along the same lines as the ""Today, Tomorrow, and Forever"" box set; collect a bunch of previously unreleased studio outtakes and live performances and put them out. While I thought ""Today, Tomorrow, and Forever"" was a worthwhile project, this one borders on being superfluous. I enjoyed the alternate takes of ""I Beg of You"" and ""Treat Me Nice"". I thought the most entertaining CD was the second one with the alternate takes from the GI Blues movie soundtrack, but I found the number of false starts in this set annoying. The live performance on the last CD is good, but not remarkable (otherwise it would have been released before).There are a few tracks in this set that are interesting, but I am not sure it is enough to justify a box set. This is for hardcore Elvis fans only, even then if you have ""Today, Tomorrow, and Forever"" I'm not sure that this set really adds anything to your collection."
2,It's all been done Before !!,"I am an Elvis fanatic, but sometimes even people like me get fed up with the constant churning out of 'alternate takes' and 'below par' concert recordings. I buy it all, hoping that I get something different to add to my collection. Unfortunately, that is not the case here. I still enjoy hearing the king sing irrespective of what CD I play, but I have really heard all of this before. Pity, I thought that I would get something out of this one."
2,Distilled Dregs,"I give this box set two stars because it is Elvis and because some effort was made to produce a decent sound. Otherwise, I would give it one star.It's largely out takes and alternate versions. Nothing really new and undiscovered in the true sense. A product of the desperate Elvis money machine.However, to someone studying Elvis' recording sessions, it might have some value."
2,Strickly for Die-Hards,when you see another Box Set with Elvis your'e thinking you might be getting something new.but this is just another slick attempt at Cashing in on the Elvis Well.Outtakes&things are all Subjective but the Problem here is that aside from the Up to date Sound Quality you are truly not messing anything if you don't get this set.the Live Concert is pretty average at best.in other words save your money there are better Sets of His Stuff around.it has some Moments but it's not worthy of more than a Couple Discs tops&even then you could get even more with just One Disc if you are going this Route with Elvis.
1,About 2/3 of these disks failed on my iMac,"About 2/3 of these disks failed. Often, they were ejected before the burning process could even start. Other times, they seemed to be burning fine, but then verification would fail. I have an iMac computer. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that my experience with these blank DVDs was different from the glowing reviews given by others.I bought a pack of TDK blank DVDs, and I've had a 100% success rate with the 20 disks that I've burned."
5,Must have,"This is my second copy of this title. Amazing reference tool. Every thing one needs to know about sex from beginning to end is in this easy to read, easy to navigate treasure. Safe even for mature children."
1,Very outdated information!,"This book was published in 1993, fourteen years ago. It is very outdated (pre-Viagra.) Would you go to a doctor whose medical library was fourteen years old? I think not."
4,Ah! The good old days of film,I loved this movie when I was a kid. I was so glad to find a copy of it. It is entertaining in a very light hearted way. Anyone who loves old movies will enjoy this film. It highlights some of the best-of-the-worst in film. Gotta love it!
4,Worth renting for sure!,"I don't know if I would buy this but it's definitely worth renting if you like the wit of the old SNL cast. Gilda Radner is great as well as John Candy, even Dan Akroyd is good even though he usually bothers me for a reason I still can't figure out. Cheech and Chong are very, very funny and I didn't even like them in the old days so that says something - somebody obviously held them back just a little bit (but not too much) and in this film it really works - there are some very funny parts. As for the clips of the various B movies they are GREAT - not too long but not too short. They give you just enough of each of these horrible movies without you getting bored (ever sat through the entire Killer Tomatoes?, if so you'll know what I mean). In retrospect I really can't complain about this film at all. I think they did a really good job of it and it's definitely worth a watch."
5,"Very funny stuff, total camp!","I saw this film when I was a child on HBO. My siblings and I used to watch it multiple times, we loved it! It isn't high art but the clips are silly and the scenes inbetween them are a blast. The late John Candy, and Gilda Radner are both hysterical. I could see why this movie may not have made it on the big screen, it isn't really suited for that type of venue. But it is a campy video delight. If you like watching bad movies for fun, they you will love watching bad movies spoofed by some of the funniest people in comedy."
1,Definitely Not My First Choice,I used this book for college-level Physics I and II and found that I was constantly referring to more succinct outside resources that did a much better job of presenting the material. I was very disappointed with the solutions manual and quizes that are available as additional resources. They were riddled with errors. I would recommend reading a few more reviews for other similar texts before buying this one. I am sure that there is something better out there.
2,"Poor explanations, making simple things confusing.","I'm told that previous editions were much more comprehensive in explanations; this fourth edition explains poorly, and our school (University of Illinois at Chicago) will not be using it after this semester. Average test scores this semester have fallen up to 50% over previous semesters. I've had to check out other books from the Science Library to fill in the gaps. Avoid this book."
2,physics text,"Posted book was not right needed volume, not specific to which volume and incorrect picture of book."
1,Disappointing,"The author doesn't explain the material very well, especially in the electricity and magnetism section. And, there is no solutions manual available."
2,TA's beware.,"I haven't read the text in all its glory, but I have TA'd for a class that uses this text. I've done probably 200-300+ problems from this text book (I've TA'd from it for 5 semesters) and by my estimate 10%+ of the solutions in the solution manual and the answers in the back of the text are incorrect. Also occasionally the solutions to the webassign problems are incorrect. Don't bother with the solution's manual, it is a waste of your time. If you have to TA for this course be sure to just work the webassign problems. Do not waste your time solving them directly from the text book and comparing them to the solutions manual. It will just piss you off and you'll waste more trying to figure out where the solutions manual is incorrect then you will actually solving the problems."
3,Wrong book,I ordered the book and didn't realize this was only the study guide for the text book. I did receive the book in good condition.
1,Just awful.,"This is not coming from a student bitter about receiving bad grades in his class; I got a 4.0 in both semesters of engineering physics. I did this, however, despite this book and not because of it. The wording is needlessly abstruse, the sample problems are worked out poorly and, quite often, the answers in the back of the book are incorrect.I used Douglas C. Giancoli's physics text as a supplement for review before my exams and, without exception, the material was presented in a more concise and understandable fashion than in the Tipler/Mosca travesty.There must have been happier moments in my life than when I sold this text back to my co-op, but none currently come to mind."
2,Learn by example,"This book teaches by example but doesn't do a good job of explaining underlying concepts. If you memorize all the examples, you'll be able to do any problem you come across; as long as it's exactly like one of the examples.If you're looking to buy it, though, it's probably because you're required to have it for a class. Look for a used one that's been trashed for really cheap, you're not going to want to keep it anyway."
1,Too complex for its own good,"I am currently using this book for a Physics I-level class. Though it covers an incredible array of topics, the authors choose to use language far too complex and examples and problems far too enigmatic for students to decipher. Doing homework and studying is an excercise more in following language and deciphering the text than anything else. Instead of learning about physics, I become frustrated and give up on the topic of the day. Even the teacher of the class struggles with the solutions manual on a regular basis. The result is a class absolutely puzzled by the material with hardly any actual physics learning occurring -- only floundering in a sea of numbers and equations."
1,This text has made my semester hell!,"The other reviews sum it all very nicely, this is a terrible physics text. Notice how heavily the number of one and two star reviews outweigh 3,4, and 5 star reviews. If you are a teacher, instructor, or professor, and use this text, you are a bad person. I just can't even express in words how bad everything is done. 80% of the time spent in this text is trying to figure out what went on in an EXAMPLE'S intermediate step."
2,Talks too much. Little deeper than needed.,"It's a good book as a reference, but not a good book for test-prep.(You will learn genenral physics stuffs more deeply in 200- 300- level mechanics,E&M;,QM, etc courses, so I believe it's important to understand essential concepts, but Tipler tries to put too much thing. That makes this book really distractive)1.Tipler talks too much, so you won't have enough time to read all and understand all of them.Usually, Tipler explains more details and concepts using complicated math, which you don't really need to know for 1st year physics.2.He tried to explain things by only using calculus, but it's easier to understand those difficult concepts after you learn mathphysics.3. Some of his practice problems are good, but about 1/3 of problems are useless.You'd better use Halliday if you need to study in short time and concentrate on important concepts.If you have enough time and want to learn broadly and deeply, Tipler might be good, but not recommanded."
3,Difficult to follow,"I purchased this textbook for my college level Calculus based Physics course. I was initially excited and looking forward to diving into this textbook. When I reviewed a few pages, I felt like I was so lost. It is a difficult read that's for sure. I recommend a study guide from Barron's to assist with this textbook!"
1,Bad writing style,Tipler writes in such a way that his explanations seem to contradict each other. Very confusing textbook. Get Halliday and Resnick instead.
3,Mistakes in 1st and 2nd Printings,"Just fyi, we are using this text in my college physics class and there are numerous errors in the first and second printings (i.e. in the problems, some of the ""known"" information is wrong). These problems do not appear to be in the third printing, however. So if you want a book that has workable problems with answers that make sense, make sure that your's is the 3rd printing."
4,Convenient - more contrast would be nice,These work very well. I just stick 4/5 on a sheet of regular paper and staple it onto the target stand. My only complaint is that the black rings are not dark or thick enough for me to see easily at 10 yds. I am old and my vision is not great.
3,"does not say it is ""incompatible with CX series""","I received this DC power adapter for my garmin etrex venture CX in high hopes it would work with my particular gps. It does not state it wasnt incompatible and only says in the description that it is compatible with etrex venture models. And, lo and behold it is NOT compatible with ETREX VENTURE CX, you need a model with the cigarette to 5pin adapter. I did receive a blackberry from work which has one of those and it works great with my gps."
1,IT DOES NOT FIT THE E TREX 20,"I DOES NOT FIT THE GARMIN E TREX 20, TOO BAD, NOW I AM ABROAD AND I CAN NOT CHANGE IT, THIS IS INCREDIBLE REALLY"
1,Never showed up,"One star is too high of a rating. I have yet to this day seen my order, and amazon sent the link to this review. well now I guess I need to call the credit card co. to get the charges removed.. It's been a month now and no order. WHATS UP PEOPLE??? If it shows up I will change the review.. Mabey."
1,Garmin accessories ripoff.,"Garmin's apparent business plan:1. Create a bewildering series of products using the same basic integrated circuits, but different connectors.2. Ripoff the customers on accessories.This adapter should sell for less than $25: look elsewhere."
1,Not the correct Garmin adapter,"Though shown as an accessory for the Garmin Model I ordered at the same time, it had the incorrect fitting so could not be used and had to be returned."
3,Garmin Vehicle DC Power Adapter for eTrex and Geko (010-10203-00),Finish: SatisfactoryFunctional Rating: Not tested Yet.Problem: The GPS end USB connector is not supplied. Which is not good.Alternative: Any Vehicle DC Power adaptor ranging 3.5 to 4 volt is good substitute.
4,"Good product, but an expensive accessory.","This product is a must if you use your GPS in your car. It will save you many, many batteries. I like the quality. It feels solid. The LED on the lighter plug is useful. It indicates that you have power. The piece that snaps into the eTrex seems to connect well. It's never come unplugged after rolling around in my truck. The cord is plenty long for my needs--about four feet. My only complaint is the cost. The price was a little more than I would liked to have spent, but it's the only game in town."
1,Oopps!,"The product description says that this charger works for all Garmin e-Trex models... Oopps! Except for the Legend Cx, which is the one I happen to have, so it was an expensive mistake for me."
5,All I can say is....wow.,"This knife has blown my mind. I have always wanted a Spyderco knife, and i have a great friend who is a former police officer who carried one around with him everywhere (a delica i believe). so i was interested in trying spyderco out but not with one of their bigger blades. Along came the Dragonfly and changed my life (maybe an exaggeration haha).But seriously i carry this knife as part of my EDC (everyday carry) and would never leave home without it.I have a ""3 is 2, 2 is 1, and 1 is none"" philosophy when it comes to my knives so i always have at least 2 on me, and the spyderco dragonfly is alyways a part of that."
4,Good case but replacement parts are expensive,"The case offers very good protection for the iPod. The plastic over the screen is very good optically and doesn't degrade the picture very much. The rubber over the wheel decreases the sensitivity enough that I don't ever need to use the lock switch. I didn't bother to cut out that opening in the case.The belt clip works well and is pretty tough, but I managed to break it. The only place I could find a replacement clip was at the iskin web site. The clip is $8 and the cheapest shipping in the US is $7.50. This comes to half of what I paid for the whole thing."
5,Worth It's Weight In Gold!,"This is NOT a Flimsy Sleeve!It fits like a glove and protects your precious iPod Classicfrom all the every day bumps & bruises the flesh is heir to.It's fairly thick, nice looking, and nice to the touch. Eventhough it adds a lot of traction to the iPod, making it muchless likely to slip off any surface (even glass) that youset it down on, it's NOT ""clammy"".Even though it's not really water proof, since it's ventedwith multiple pin-holes in the back, it pretty much protectsit if somebody rains on your parade.The Clear Poly Carb Shield that slips in place in the frontis reasonably scratch resistant.. and again.. thick enoughto take about anything you can throw at it.If there's any drawbacks at all, it might be that it's toobulky to slip into some Speaker Units... but it's worthslipping it off & back on to have the overall protection."
5,Great product,"This has to be the best ipod case ever made the only down fall is that some head phone jacks i.e ipod to AV cables will not work unless you pull the case back, O and as with all silicon products i guess, it collects lint like mad."
4,Good product!,This product is exactly as described. I got it as a gift and the recipient loved it. Only bad thing is that the belt clip on the back is not detachable.
4,Worked great!,"The iSkin arrived speedily and was fairly easy to install around my iPod. The iSkin does have a little ""buckling"" around the edge that I can't adjust. It does a good job, however, and the iPod is still easy to operate."
2,skin doesnt stay in place,I didnt like the fact that the skin didnt stay in place very well. It also wouldnt fit in my dock
2,NO way to use this with docking stations and car fm transmitters,This case encloses the ipod completely and theres no way you can use this with speaker docks and fm transmitter in the car.Its a damn good case if you are ok with the ipod being in the case all the time.
4,Does the job,"This iskin will give the ipod great protection should it ever fall or get bumped. However it changes the overall sleek look of the ipod. It makes it look bulky. The rubber of the iskin attracts a lot of fuzz because of the type of rubber it is. It does the job for protecting the ipod, but if your looking to keep the look of your ipod I would find something else."
5,awesome ipod protection,"this is the best case i've seen/used for the newer ipods. the (average) $30 you'll spend on this case is totally worth it considering you'll spend $250-$350 on an ipod. you don't have to worry about things getting between this case and your ipod to scratch it. the only part of the ipod not covered are the small hole where your headphones plug in and two tiny holes in the back of the case where the belt clip goes, if you choose to remove it. the hard plastic screen protection doesn't distort the look of the screen at all, and the silicone that covers the click wheel protects the ipod, yet it's so thin that it doesn't take away from the sensitivity of the click wheel at all."
4,Good protection,"I think the case does a very good job protecting the ipod. Easy installation, but I wouldn't want to take it on and off too often. Collects dust like krazy. Also, the skin around the headphone jack is little bit too thick, thus, certain minijacks will not stay plugged in (such as the apple video/audio cable). Besides those picky complaints, not a bad case at all."
4,Pretty good,Very sturdy. good protection. I wish it were a little bit more comfortable when clipped to my belt.
4,Works,I'm very pleased with my purchase. It can attract dust and dirt but it is very easy to clean. My main concern is that it protects my iPod and it does.
5,GREAT BUY!!!,"I was a little skeptical about buying this product, wasnt sure how it was going to look... but I am completely satisfied!!!! It offers great protection- especially the screen- its crystal clear!!! so much better than the ugly scrathes my old video ipod had!!!"
5,Where has this book been hiding?,"What a delightful, simple, provoking gem of a book, and for all age groups. Looks like I was ready to find it! I would, however, only have given it 4 1/2 stars if such option was available. Having said that, I found The Celestial Bar to be engaging, informative, and, thankfully, not another book of techniques. There was a moment near the end when I really felt a strong emotional release, for which I was so appreciative. This book is an easy read, almost too easy; yet, lots of high quality ""meat and potatoes""(or, whatever the comparable vegetarian version would be) are found in it's pages...a really strong base upon which to stand...concise and clear. I do so appreciate learning through the medium of a decent story, with a bit of adventure, especially when the central character reminds me of a younger version of myself. We should all be so fortunate to find such wonderful teachers as are found within the pages of this short book. Thank you Tom Youngholm!"
5,I got confidence to recommend ''brotherhood'',"It's a one of the greatest band in japan. if you are interested in B'z, you should listen to brotherhood first. you'll understand my sauce of confidence. I suggest you to listen to ''fear'' ''girigirichop'' ''shine''.they are awesome."
1,Failed after 15 months,"Purchased end of June 2005, had no problems with it until this week: It simply failed, without any warning.With all of the computers I've owned/used over the years, I never had a power supply fail. Hopefully mine was an isolated experience.Amazon were very good about arranging a refund."
3,1 SATA,Works but has only one SATA plug so beware if you have a modern computer with two or more SATA devices.
3,Did not last,"I purchase this power supply to replace one that had burned out in an old (nearly 10 years old) Gateway PC. It lasted a couple of years before burning out, but at least by that time the PC needed to be replaced anyway."
4,Good PS,"Worked as expected. Good PS. Only one thing. Felt the cooling fan a bit slow, otherwise great."
5,Great power supply,"This is an awesome power supply that was extremely easy to install. Now, I have purchased many power supplies in the past and this by far is the quietest."
5,A new dimension to London,"I first read this collection about two years ago and still go back to selected works from time to time. If all you have read by London is ""The Call of The Wild"", then you have not been exposed to the depth of his writing.Stories like ""A piece of steak"" and the more popular ""To build a fire"" show London's ability to highlight the human spirit. ""Strength of the strong"" has deep political connotations and probably inspired ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell, a contemporary of London.There are really so many great stories in this collection. I advise anyone to explore the work of Jack London further."
4,the wellspring,"... Do you like good writing? Are you socially aware? Do you really think the only thing good is Call of the Wild? Be prepared for the GOOD stuff.He doesn't write the fluff. It's all socially relevant or life an death stuff. And it's all written VERY well.Favorite Stories : the Apostate, and the 2 versions of To Build a Fire ( one the Boy Scout version, the other the real deal.)... READ IT! LOVE IT!"
4,Large enough for most apples,"We had an Everyday Living apple slicer that was smaller (3-3/8"" diameter) and would not fit over our largest diameter apples. This KitchenAid Slicer is larger (4-1/4"" diameter) and makes clean cuts a slight pull on the sliced wedge and its free. I recommend this item. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't finish the cut, you have to pull the wedge free. Nonetheless I would get it again."
1,Broke after 5 weeks,Pros: It worked fine. BIG con: It broke really fast after only 5 weeks. My XOXO apple cutter lasted for years before it broke. The Kitchenaid name apparently means nothing anymore.
3,The Smell is AWFUL,"While I like how moisturizing this cream is, the stink of it is too much to handle. It literally smells like vanilla scented sauteed onions."
5,One of my new secrets,"So I am always moving towards the all natural thing. Neem is really good for you in a lot of different ways, you just need to watch how you use it. I put this on my skin and put fragrance on over it. I always get asked why I smell so good. Despite it's healing properties, smells clean and nice. So glad to have this with an all natural product."
1,I hate it,I am disappointed. This smells more like a vanilla cream rather than neem cream. This is misleading. The ingredients in the cream are not fully listed.
4,works miracles so far,"I did not find this product on Amazon, but at a local store. I did my research on Neem and hoped it might help. I have had a rash on my inner thighs for almost 2 months now (I am not over weight or unhygienic). After treating myself unsuccessfully for what I thought was ringworm, I went to my doctor. She told me it was for moisture due to working out and gave me a cream with nystatin and a steriod. I used the cream she gave me and stopped working out and the rash went away (mostly), but came back when stopped using it.I bought the Neem cream and used it every 12 hours. After 36 hrs the rash was almost completely gone, no longer irratated and obviously healing. I also put a bit on my arms where I have keratosis pilaris, it is looking about 50-60% better after 2 days. The cream smells good and a little bit goes a long way."
5,Best ever!,"I've been in the beauty business for over 30 years, worked for major cosmetic companies who sell creams and lotions for $150 a jar. This is by far the best I've ever used. It's not fancy, or fragrant, it just works. My girl friend asked me if I'd had a lazer peel, I said no why, she said my skin just glowed and looked younger. When I told her what I used she purchased it immediately and she is VERY impressed with it as well. I use it twice a day... You can see and feel a difference right away, no waiting for weeks to see if it works.also I use the neem moisturizing shampoo as a body wash and to wash my face with...Love it. But for your hair, forget it, not so great."
3,Stinks !!!,"There will be more to come regarding quality or effectiveness of this cream because I just opened it and used it for the first time but the smell is disgusting. I mean really really really bad. It smells like peanut butter gone mad. its rotten!Couldn't the manifacturers add a hint of lavendar or rose oil or somehing else to mask this hiddious smell. I don't think i will be able to use this cream. How disappointing, I was so looking forward to using it.I wonder if i can add some lavender oil to it?"
5,Works perfectly,"I bought this item to download mini DV video from my camcorder, it's works perfectly and it was easy to install."
4,good value for money,"I use this card on a windows ME system. It works great. And considering that it came with cable, it is good value for money. Only caveat is the ULead software that comes bundled - it is pretty useless. It is basic version of ulead and doesn't work properly. But the card works great. It was easy to install and came with software."
1,Didn't work for me,"I inserted this card into my P4 2.4Ghz PC running Win XP Pro and then hooked to my Sony DCR-HC40. The camcorder was recognized, however, the connection was lost after several minutes, then the connection was regained if I turn the camcorder off and back on or unplug and replug the firewire cable. I used Adobe Premiere Pro to capture video, about 100 frames were dropped during 3 minutes capturing then connection was lost for no reason. Amazon replaced my card, the new card was even worse, my camcorder was not even recognized. I bought a Belkin 1394 PCI card and a Belkin 1394 cable. Voila! No problem anymore, camcorder was immediately recognized and the connection stays for ever, and no frame was dropped at all during like 50 minutes capturing. Comparing this card and cable to Belkin ones, these are obviously cheap made and the quality is unstable. Some buyers may not have any problem at all, but I just had bad luck and got the lemons."
4,Works well,This card was easy to install and works well. The included software and cable are acceptable as well.
4,No problems,"The port was easy to install and is easy to use. The cable that comes with it is very short, so take that into consideration. The price was right though, the port and cable from Amazon for about $20 when Best Buy had the two sold separately for around $70."
3,Buyer beware!,"I selected this product because the item is described as a PCI card with cable and Ulead video editing software. To my disappointment the Ulead software comes without a user manual. Nice! I bought this product for my son but now he's turned off by it because he doesn't have a ""how to"" manual. The card works great! I recommend the card but do not buy it for the software. I contacted Corel/Ulead and they refuse to offer me a copy of the documentation. Seems this version of the software is deemed by Corel as ""Not For Resale"" so they provide zero support for their users. This important piece of info is not being provided by StarTech for it's customers."
1,I exchanged it for the Belkin PCI card.,"I bought the Startech card including the cable and some throw away software because of the great price. It installed beautifully, but when Adobe Premiere Elements starting recording from my mini DV camera, I started receiving ""dropped frame"" messages. I exchanged it for the Belkin 3 port PCI card and the Belkin cable for about $20 more. The Belkin set-up recorded about a dozen tapes so far without one glitch and no aggravation on my part. Often the most economical item you can buy is not the one with the lowest price."
2,software difficult to use,"The product itself I have no problem with, but the software could be more user friendly."
4,Installed easily and works well,"This card slipped into my PCI slot easily and was recognized quickly by my PC. However, upon installing, there was a software glitch (I use XP), which was resolved when I removed the hardware and reinstalled it. I did my first download using the Firewire card and it was quick and without issue."
5,IEEE-1394 FireWire PCI Card with Digital Video,"Excellen product, really I obtained results mas of what was waiting, besides the included software it he is easy and rapid to do a domestic movie, I connect my camcorder Sony Digital8 to this card IEEE-1394 and the quality of video in ideal without any loss of frames. very goodExelente producto, realmente obtuve resultados mas de lo que esperaba, ademas del software incluido es facil y rapido hacer una pelicula casera, yo conecto mi camara Sony Digital8 a esta tarjeta IEEE-1394 y la calidad de video en optima sin ninguna perdida de frames. Se las recominedo."
5,Works great,"I'm currently running Windows XP on my computer and it recognized this Firewire board without any trouble at all. I've used the card for downloading movie files and it works great. Also, the software that came with it (Ulead VideoStudio 8.0) is excellant!!"
1,Too little for the price,I saw the book image and thought it was a regular book; but found it is a very small book with about 100 so so questions all in big fonts to fill the pages.Definitely not worth the price.
3,Feedback,I found this book a good master piece . On the other hand I think author should put more focus on configuration related issues .
1,Awful - misleading book title @ description,"The advertisement for this book is the Title: SAP MM Certification Questions, Answers, and Explanation. In reality it nothing more than a book of questions an employer may use to ask a potential SAP MM employee hire. There is not detail regarding MM Certifcation. At most the book is worth $24.95 not $54.95. The author should be embarrassed for doing this.Do not buy!"
1,Don't bluff your way into a job,"I have an issue with the whole idea of buying a book just to get through an interview. I find it rather distasteful. I looked at this book as someone at work had it and I was disappointed at the content. I guess if it was the only book out there on MM then it would be be worth buying, but there are much better books out there if you actually want to know about the subject matter."
1,"SAP MM interviw question, answers and expectations","Really I think, this is a very basic book, and the issue here is that the guy the wrote the book, do no have enough material background. I think will be better to write the book since the material manager (I mean a guy that have an APICS training) view point.If I could I will send back the book, I wont recommend the book.I wanted to know every step about items master, warehouse,production control, MRP, MPS answers."
1,SAP MM Certification And Interview Questions,This book is very expensive to the knowledge it contains.May be useful for beginners in SAP-MM otherwise waster of money as for me.Would not recommend if anyone has some basic understanding in MM.
3,Just basic stuff,It's just basic. I am not sure you will be able to clear any certification exam with this book.
1,Small Book - Big Price,This is a very small book. I know why there were no previews of the inside pages. It is only 127 pages long and each page is usually only 1/4 full with a large font.Most pages have less than six or seven sentences on each page.The information is cryptic and vary sparse.A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.
5,move from technical to functional,"I have been programming in ABAP for several years and have experience in SAP. I was interested in learning MM, and learning so that I can get a job as a fucntional consultant. This book helped me learn what areas of SAP MM I should study, rather than reading the entire book. This book will help you realize what is important, and what is not important. It will help you understand what to learn. That is the key to this book.Once you read this, you will know where else to turn for further study. This is not a cook book, but is a study guide that helped me get a job."
5,earned my certification earned my job,Thank you to this book which was a good help to me finding my job in SAP MM - good help for the learning trying to come into the field of SAP
4,Food - 'Forever Is A Dream' (Fallout),"Originally released in 1969, as this was the obscure pop-psychedelic band's only record. Most fans would likely consider Food to be light-weight psych. Tunes that I got the most out of were ""Naive Prayers"", the rocking ""No"", ""Lady Miss Ann"", the six-minute ""Coming Back"" and the fun-to-listen to ""Inside The Mirror"". Line-up: Steve White - lead vocals, Bill Wukovich - guitar & vocals, Erick Scott Filipowitz - bass, Ted Ashford - keyboards & producer and Barry Mraz - drums & percussion. Album was recorded and finalized TerMar Recordings and John Tolbart's in Chicago. Might draw in fans of C. A. Quintet, Gandalf and the Moody Blues."
4,fast-paced enjoyable mystery/thriller,"This is a fast-paced very enjoyable mystery/thriller which sometimes scratches at the edge of being a bit unrealistic but life can be stranger than fiction. The story and the two main characters are well done, fleshed out and credible. At the end the sex scenes took up a bit too much space IMO. Loved the setting in Oklahoma. A good story.And the editing and proofreading is well done!"
2,Toshiba 57HM167,"I purchased a Toshiba 57HM157 from a local retailer in Oregon, Video Only June 11-07. 4 days after getting the TV the Lamp went out. I read reviews on other rear projection Toshiba products prior to my purchase and noticed several complaints of short lamp life which prompted me to purchase an extended in-home warranty. I have had the TV less than 30 days so I will be getting a new one from the retailer. BEWARE OF TOSHIBA REAR PROJECTION TVs. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A EXTENDED WARRANTY"
2,Lemon,"Got it in Aug. 2007, wish I would have looked here first. I didn't use it much, mostly for games and movies, not much television-watching. Tried to turn it on last night, and the screen wouldn't turn on. Eventually got a pattern of led's on the front panel that indicated lamp not working (a yellow led with red flashing). There was also a voice that came from the television that said ""Lamp not working"" heh. I called Toshiba, and the guy had me hang up and take the lamp out, then call him back. He asked me if I could see any damage (I couldn't see any, but didn't know what I was looking for). He said that it was probably not the bulb, but the housing, and that I should take it to the nearest service dealer (40 miles away, ugh). Felt like I was getting the runaround. I'll just give my money to some other company in the future, and be sure to check here before I do :) . Lesson learned. It's a shame, because I liked the television when it worked."
1,"Warranty Problems, terrible service",I purchased this TV in early April. After having the TV for 35 days the lamp went completely dead. I requested service from Toshiba who claims that the necessary items (lamp and light engine) are on back order and then can't tell me when they will arrive. I have been without a TV or suitable replacement for a month and a half. What can I say but don't buy this TV and don't buy products from Toshiba. This is the second projection TV that I purchased from Toshiba in two years and both have had problems. Furthermore Toshiba doesn't care how long you have to wait and won't promise repair times or turnaround times. BUYER BEWARE - Don't buy this TV just because it has a cheap price. It wont work well!!
3,Good for the 5 minutes it lasted!,"The TV looked in good store so purchased from Amazon, came in good condition but just after five minutes the whole screen got green pixels spread all over, consulted an official Toshiba technician and he said something wrong with color scan module so had to return it.I think something is not right with the way Toshiba makes it televisions"
5,So far so Good!,"Great experience and price buying this tv through Amazon. Picture is great, came just as promised brand spanking new. Would buy again."
1,Toshiba 57hm167 TV,"This was our second Toshiba in a row and the second one we've had major problems with. 31 days after purchasing it, it quit working. It's now been two full months with no repair. Toshiba claims the ""part is back ordered""- for two full months. It's not the lamp or another common part, but a mystery part that needs to be shipped. Apparently from the fourth dimension. We've had multiple repair people over to the house (both from the store that sold it to us and a subcontractor from Toshiba) and still have a VERY expensive non working TV set.Avoid Toshiba- avoid this TV!"
1,Amazon does not protect its customers and allows inferior sellers in its marketplace********,"Large items that require long distance trucking take forever to arrive. One seller, Tiger Direct, could really care less if you get your product. They will charge you extra for quick delivery and then tell you that large items take several weeks to arrive. Trucking companies such as ABF don't care when you get your product. They don't deliver on Saturday and don't answer emails.Amazon talks a good talk, but they really don't stand behind you on your purchases. I would suggest going to a local retailer to purchase large items."
1,Out Of Round,"Purchased these tires because of all the rave reviews, however after installing themI noticed as if the tires had a bump on them that made the bike ride like it was going over a speed bump. Switched the tires around ( laborious ) and problem was not solved.Upon spinning the tires, you could see they were ""out of round"". One was worse than the other.Quite disappointed with these tires since I paid alittle more than some of the others onAmazon hoping it would be a better quality tire w/o problem. I would rate this a minus starif it were available.Will install old tires back on and discard these.Out $$$"
4,Decent tires for the regular biker.,"I've got an older Schwinn, and the original tires were dryrotted, I bought these as a cheap replacement. They mounted very easily, and they seem to be working fine. I live on a gravel road, these tires takes the rough ground just fine. I can't justify buying more expensive tires, these work fine."
3,ok tire,"Nice tire but doesn't fit the old school rims very well. The side walls are too shallow and it barely catches inside the rim, I'm always worried it's going to pop off the rim and I'll be in the middle of nowhere when it happens."
1,No Help,"This book offers very little help. Contents and index listings do not lead to needed information; information is hard to find, i.e. tork specs. Trouble shooting does not cover all scenerios. This is a good book if all you need is something to sit on a shelf and gather dust."
3,Strong casting helps weak script.,"I decided to buy this dvd after seeing how many good actors had supporting roles and cameos in it(Margaret Cho, Mike Myers, Robin Ruzan, Ben Stiller, Tim Meadows, etc.), and because Strangers With Candy/Second City alums David Pasquesi and Mitch Rouse were in it. Well, individually, all these people are pretty funny, and in the movie they play what they're given pretty well, but something is missing. Most times you'll have to make an effort to laugh. I think the problem is the script -the plot isn't too compelling and the situations it produces are lacking some driving force.However, since I am a fan of some of the actors, just seeing them play their roles was interesting, and enough reason to keep watching. It isn't the best dvd I ever bought, but it's a part of my collection now and I'm satisfied with it."
4,Tairrie B is a Queen!,"Ive been a big fan of Tairrie B, and her music since her first rock band, 'Manhole'. I feel My Ruins stuff is more put together lyrically and musically. Shes got a great voice, a terror inducing scream that could put any male of female singer to shame. Tairrie is at her sultry best on this cover of Tainted Love. The metalish guitars are a great addition to the song, the screaming at the end also adds a cool mood to the song. As you can see, I really liked this CD!"
1,I hate Freud when applied to people the author never met,"I must agree with some of the other reviews that have appeared on this book. I got this book with the intention of learning something more about Toulouse Lautrec. I really like all aspects of his work and wanted to find something that would be more true to life than the the movie ""Moulin Rouge."" Usually in most biographies of artists there is a more than passing interest in the work. I did not find this aspect in this book. Instead the author focuses on rather facile Freudian looks at the paintings themselves. As Freud himself observed, ""sometimes a cigar is only a cigar."" Elements of composition are subjected to a desire to demonstrate some sort of unified field theory toward Toulouse Lautrec's art. I am still looking for a book that illuminate's Toulouse Lautrec's art and life for this clearly is not it."
2,Nothing New,"I was excited with the prospect of reading a well written, well researched biography of one of the great artists. Well I was put off from the first. Referring to Henri's body as tiny, painfully deformed. I thought ""Oh boy!"" ""Here we go again"". It made me wonder how many people with disabilities she had ever met and that way of thinking that poor Henri could never find true love because of his size. Hmmm? What about Danny De Vito, Paul Williams, even throw in Truman Capote. All of these men are(were) small of height and ther lives were NOT dictated by the fact of not being six feet tall. Other than that their were no fresh insights, maybe just a tidbit here and there. Also did we really need those wonderful photos of Henri defecating on the beach?"
3,Boo! Hiss! To the Naysayers . . . I recommend this book,"If they were misleading in their marketing of the book, then shame on Peachpit Press and Macromedia Press. This book does, however, deliver on what it promises in the Introduction. Coupled with Flash MX Unleashed by Matthew Pizzi, David Vogeleer, Todd Coulson, et al., I was able to pass the test. Along with the coupon, it is worth its money in my humble opinion. In fact, I went ahead and bought the Developer Study Guide from my experience with this book."
1,Don't base your readiness on this book.,"The book is too short and lacks any real substance. You get as much, if not more information from the online help that comes with Flash MX. After reading the study guide, I looked at the sample questions that Macromedia has on their site for the Flash Designer test. The book didn't even help answer those sample questions. The only good thing about the guide is the 15% discount off of the exam, which pretty much covers the cost of this guide."
2,wait,"wait for the Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Certified Designer Study Guide by James English, it will be out in Nov.The exam has 4 domains; Planning, Visual Design, Experience Design, and Optimization, Pub, Workflow. Learn these 4 areasby using the program, reading the manual, and refer to the Macromedia web site."
3,Good but you still need a bit more...,"I passed the certification, but the information on this book was not enough. I used it as a reference along with the online help and the test outline from the Macromedia site. If you you don't know what all of the titles of all of the items on that outline are, then don't waste your money taking the test.The book is good, but it would have been better to cover a bit more. I would say it covered around 50% of the test, unfortually you need to get at least 70% to pass."
2,Certified Macromedia Flash MX Designer Study Guide,First off amazon says that this book is 412 pages. Ok I'm very disappointed because the version of the book I got is only 112 pages. This book is way too small to be a study guide for any test. Each chapter only has 3 review questions. I was really disappointed with this book the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you get %15 percent off when taking the ($$$) dollar test. I think I will wait until someone does a better version of this book before taking the Flash MX Designer test.
1,15 % Discount on Test,"We all pretty much agree that the book is rather thin and covers topics in a very minimal and thin way, but after all, we were going to get our free 15 % off on the test.I went to vue.com, after buying the book, signed up for the exam and just when i put in the voucher code a nice message came up:"" This promotion is VALID TIL 31 / 2003"".Great job!I don't recomed this book simply cause you can buy something better, covering all topics extensivly and in details.PLUS THE DISCOUNT ON THE TEST IS NO LONGER VALID!"
1,poor guide,this book seems to be done in a rush. few sample questions. no mock test no nothing. even the promised sample test at [website] is not up yet. too few examples and not detail enough. this guide is as good as not having it.
4,A helpful tool in my creative writing class,"I have started using this well thought out book in my high school creative writing class. My students, most of whom are reading below grade level, easily understand the stories. The author notes and editor notes help me prepare them for their writing challenge.This is a valuable teaching tool in my classroom."
4,Not for small children - Electronic toy,"The seller was great, but I would not recommend this for a small child. It is meant to sit on a shelf and entertain with the ipod. Thanks"
5,Andrew Gold thanks you for buying this album,"What's with the white suit and hat that Andrew Gold is wearing in the photo? What's with the matching cane? He thinks he's dancing in the sky on a large cloud! This original Asylum release contains the Top 20 hit THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND which would be the theme for the ABC Emmy-winning sitcom The Golden Girls. However,the theme was covered by an unknown artist. Gold's composition of the song earned him endless royalties from September 1985 to this very day. The sitcom has been relentlessly syndicated since 1989(Cable Television's Lifetime currently airs reruns of the sitcom). The other songs are good."
1,Disappointed,"I had heard good things about this book and was looking forward to reading it. Sorry but what a load of nonsense. I can't help but fail to see what the connection to how the shape and angle of your toes can say so much about your personality. I also do not see how it all related to reflexology. Furthermore I object to the authors statement in the beginning that if you fail to see and understand or take in what it is he is saying, it is because of your own denial etc. What I was expecting was more on the lines of, an indentation on the heal can indicate ..... (if no physical explanation as in an injury can be used). But it had nothing like that at all. I was very disappointed."
1,The pseudo-science psychology,This book is written with a degree of authority that this information is based on relevant data and has some basis of truth to it. In reality it is just pseudo-science masquerading as an alternative psychological system which has within in little actual truth.It is baseless and totally subjective and really has no connection to reflexology at all. The star is for the illustrator's pretty colors!!!As for the price - what an incredible rip-off!!Heartily not recommended....
5,Tight-rope walker extraordinaire...,"This live concert performance is genius of a high order. For those familiar with the improvised solo piano concerts of Keith Jarrett, this is perhaps the ""next step"". While treating existing tunes during this concert, it must be stressed that each tune is merely a ""jumping off point"" for something truly spontaneous. I consider it as wholly improvised as the Jarrett concerts where there is no ""tune"" treatment at all. What is astounding, even to those already familiar with Mehldau's brilliance, is the risk-taking at every turn. This music is courageous, original, organic, and exquisitely beautiful...Mehldau is a ""spontaneous composer"" who makes full use of the dynamic/touch qualities of the piano as a compositional device. The piano is an orchestra, and man does he ever orchestrate! He's walking the tightrope, and there's no safety net - miraculously, he never needs one."
4,Gifted jazz pianist on his own,"This CD is my first exposure to the art of Brad Mehldau, and a most impressive artist he is. It's not just the fistfuls and cascades of notes that issue from his fingers, as breathtaking as his virtuosity can be. As with all great jazz artists the beat is ever-present in his playing, even with the fewest notes and at the slowest tempi--the Gershwin standards are wonderful examples of this and perhaps the most appealing tracks on the disc. Elsewhere he elaborates on Nick Drake, Thelonius Monk and Radiohead to always fascinating if sometimes overlong results (the Paranoid Android track lasts almost twenty minutes). A bit of Philip Glass or other minimalist flavor occasionally creeps in with his obsessive dwelling on a single pitch for long stretches--whether you'll respond to that depends on how well you like such things. Still, there aren't many jazz pianists around, I would guess, who can sustain such a concert as this. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Jazz Piano ?,"Precise piano, pianistic, excellent technique and intonation. But Jazz piano - I dont think so. The style is all his own - didnt hear influences of any artist nor idiom except for likely classical training. I made the purchase based on what I'd read in the on-line reviews. This was my introduction to Mr. Mehldau - I was looking forward to solo jazz piano on a par with Roger Kelloway, vintage Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, even recent Keith Jarrett following recovery from serious illness. What my perception missed were the necessary jazz elements of syncopation, harmonic invention and development, and rhythm. It was interesting."
2,exchanging mine,"My experience with this product was less than satisfactory. I installed it on an XP machine according to the instructions. It led to error messages and the creation of an LPT3 port which was ""unusable"". It did create COM4 and COM5 which is what I would have expected.However, my machine came to a grinding halt, would hand indefinitely on startup.I did a system restored and reinstalled the PCI board. Same thing.Perhaps I got a lemon so I will exchange it. Clearly the other reviewers here had a more positive experience."
1,Caused XP Pro Dell Machine to Freeze,Installed this card to add more serial ports to a Dell Dimension 4400 running XP Pro SP3. Install went fine except that it did add an unusable parallel port. I used the ports to print to industrial label printers on a packaging machines. The print job would make it to the printer fine but after sending a print job the processor would immediately jump to 47-60%. Then If you did anything else on the computer it would jump to 100% and freeze. Task Manager was no help and did not show a process consuming the processor. Used the latest drivers available from the manufacturer. I figure it's a driver issue. The board has jumpers on it with no explanation of what they are for and nothing on the web site about them. Solved my problem by purchasing a different brand based on a different chipset. Best Connectivity Multi IO PCI board based on a SystemBase Chipset.
2,Did not work with my XP,Installed the serial port and it created an LPT3 that was unusable. Same problem as another user had (see other reviews). Hope this is not an XP issue and will return mine for another one. Hope this is just a bad one.
3,Ok Part,Product arrived as promised. Installed OK. Have had software issues since installing drivers. Seems to be the card software. Would not buy again.
1,Arrived defective - drivers wouldn't load,"I bought this card to replace exactly the same model - a DB9 connector pin broke (they're thin on 2nd port). The new card wouldn't match up to any driver (I downloaded newest drivers after CD failed). This usually means the PCI configuration space on the card is corrupt so the card can't be matched to the driver's .inf file (Vendor ID or Device ID).I spent 2 hours with chat tech support - helpful and easy to talk with, but still had a defective card 2 hours later.I was able to steal a part off the new card (the DB9 cable) and fix the old card with it, so I have 2 working serial ports ($26 for a $2 cable effectively). The cost of return on top of the 2 hours already spent is too great to proceed.I'd say this product has quality problems (cheap DB9) and not so hot quality control (PCI configuration bad).I've previously used SIIG serial cards with no problem - I think I'd buy one of those instead of this, for a few $ more, if I had it to do over again."
5,Templar has done it again!,"After writing my review of Sir Templar's other book ""The Rules of Work"", I scoured the Net looking for this one. Unfortunately, it hadn't been released in the U.S. at that time. I stumbled upon it and immediately snatched it up!Once more, Templar has laid down the rules of workplace conduct and strategy in a concise, direct, and easy-to-digest manner that stresses points simply while never insulting the reader. All of the ideas in this book have been published in other books by other writers, but this book culls it all together in one very portable resource which easily makes this one of the highest cost:value ratios out there!I might sound like a zealot, but try and you'll understand why I'm so enthusiastic about Templar's books!"
4,A slick list of rules for ruling at the office,"New or struggling managers will enjoy this practical, easy-to-read book of management tips, but experienced managers should take a look, too. Richard Templar writes in a ""straight-from-the-cuff"" style (no dry textbook terminology or dusty case studies here). He packs his manual with great, even if a bit obvious, lists of advice. We recommend this breezy, practical rulebook. To be a better manager, read it and ask yourself if you are still following the best practices. If you know what to do, are you doing it? If you don't know what to do, start reading."
5,staple for managers,"This book is great, I am (was) a manager for years and would buy this as a gift for all of my trainees. Puts your job in perspective."
2,Easy reference!,"If you are looking towards learning something new in management, you will be disappointed. As Richard Templar stated himself, ""You won't find anything here you probably didn't already know.""If you are looking to learn methods or steps towards being a good manager, this book will not be contributing to that.This book is a concise summary of rules that you should abide and be aware to be a good manager. It is a consolidation of the good advices that you always heard, read and see in your work place, at seminars and in books.It merely states an observed action, and provides a good reference to the rules at work."
2,Don't waste your money,I am so sorry I bought this book. It does not contain anything new. There are better books on the subject. Save your money for better authors!
2,Letdown,"After playing 'Eurpean Air War', I assumed that this was a benchmark from which other games could be measured, but boy, was I wrong! The missions are sadly limited, and worse of all, once you paly them, they are sadly two-dimensional. What is most annoying is that anytime you try to do some aerobatics on this game, the plane stalls! Very disappointing if you've played the better sims."
2,not too good for small kids,"My daughter (2 yrs old) loves all kinds of bugs, picks them up, etc. I got her the Magic School Bus movie on the Bees and the one on the Butterflies. She loved them. This one was a disappointment though. I like spiders, and I had the 'Itzy Bitzy Spider' song in mind. But this video portrays spiders as ugly monsters, whose only rediming quality is that they are 'good trappers'. Also, a large part of the movie shows the drive-in film the class is watching, about a giant insect that is being fought by the army. This part does not teach anything, is very long, and is in black and white."
5,Very cool,I love this series and this book is right up on my top list. I loved that this author talked about collage and what growing up is really about. I am in my Senior year and this story helprd me realize that I cant avoid growing up. I just need to hang on and scream like crazy!!!
4,Good book but at times slow,Usually i read the Robin Jones Gunn books in one night. This one took 2.It was a good book but somehow it did not have enough how do you say it to me details or maybe to much.So that is why i gave it 4 stars
5,Thoughts on Pamela Crawford's Container Gardens for Florida,This book and the accpanying DVD are easy to understand and instructions are easy to follow.The author is honest and willing to share her ideas for making and using containers for plants to enhancea garden. She relates well with persons not as versed as she is in creating a beautiful garden space.This appealed to me as I am a novice Florida gardener.
5,Container Gardens,"One of my gardens always fills up with water anytime it rains, so the soil and plants get washed away. This book shares creative and decorative ideas for having container gardens so the all of the Florida rain does not wash away your garden."
5,Outstanding!,"Container Gardens for Florida is the kind of step-by-step book I pray for when I'm taking on new projects. It is filled with useful information about container gardening in Florida climates. Beginners and intermediates are sure to find something new. Much of the information is presented in pictures, which serve their purpose perfectly. They are crystal clear, informative, beautiful and inspiring. I can't wait to read Crawford's other books."
1,This book is a fraud!,"This book is nothing but a slightly updated re issue of ""In Praise of Hard Industries"" with an Introduction issued as a paperback. The publishers page even states right at the top quote: ""Previously published as In Praise of Hard Industries in 1989 by Houghton Mifflin"".You might want to read this if you haven't read the original, but I find it very deceptive indeed to re issue it with a different name hoping to entice readers of the previous book into thinking they are going to get something other than a few cosmetic changes here and there!"
3,I thought it was ok,This book was not that great. I exspected alot more pictures about her life and things like that. I do not think that the book did her justice. This young woman acomplished so many things in a short time.
5,Great book for strength and speed training,"Wong's methodology is similar to that of Charles Atlas. This book, however, does not involve someone getting sand kicked in his face. And the techniques are based on dynamic instead of static resistance. Highly recommended."
3,Good read but best benefit would be from instruction,My title says it all. I like the book and have used it on my own but feel that instruction would provide a much deeper benefit. It's safe which is the best thing about it.
3,Would you buy it if it didn't have a guy who was ripped on the cover?,"Chances are the answer is no. This book is OK for the price. There is no doubt about it...the techniques are viable.However, literally half of this material is either warm-up (basic stretches) or simply self-evident (pushups). Descriptions of each movement are not bad, and the supplemental pictures are mediocre. I'd venture to say that half of the material in this book is available for free on the internet(with better explanitory photos/pictures), as very little if any of the content here is original.Overall, the techniques in this book are great ones to include in a comprehensive excercise program, but for anyone who isn't 90 years old, without access to proper training equipment, or in physical therapy, it's not worth buying."
2,Might help some,"I am exmilitary and heavily involved in martial arts. I love bodyweight conditioning and really was looking forward to reading this book. When I read the book my reaction is that you can learn more in high school gym class! This may help some people who do not exercise regularly, but for everyone else it is a waste of money."
3,good for the price,"Good for the price. Old fashioned looking, but good information. Pushing Yourself to Power and other John Peterson books are more exciting reads and more modern in tone and content."
4,"Good book, but...","Harry Wong presents an interesting book on ""Dynamic Strength"" exercises -- or for others, ""moving isometrics"". While well written, there are some confusing bits in there that may take a little interpretation, but otherwise, I like his program for two reasons: 1) relatively simple, yet sweat-producing workouts, and 2) no equipment (besides two chairs, and a short stick or dowel rod) needed. As the cover suggests, this book is directed at martial artists, so you will find it geared to developing power in that regard; more definition rather than raw muscle. Besides some confusing instructions for a *few* exercises (maybe I just misread?), this is a great book, filled with illustration. There are plenty of exercises in here to keep you fit, and I would reccomend it."
4,A no-equipment method of increasing strength,"This book is a great deal considering it's price. The author shows and describes every exercise in detail and I had no problem following right along from cover to cover. The main advantage of this system is that virtually no equipment is required to produce results. Many of the exercises can be performed in ""odd"" places such as at school, the office, etc. The system is a strength building system (not cardio) so in many ways it is similar to weight lifting without the stress. It is the ideal low impact system for those that want to develop additional strength."
3,History or Homily,"After the first chapter or two, one begins to get a bit tired of the homily. The moral of the story - or his moral for his story - at times seems a bit contrived. However, the book is very readable and a good introduction to Medieval Spain and the cross-fertilization of Islamic, Jewish and Christian cultures. However, let the reader beware, Spanish history is a bit more complicated. It is difficult to find a ""non-biased"" account of the time period - and this work is definitely not ""non-biased"" - and for all the good the author has attempted , the moral of his story seems to be to the detriment of real history. If I want a homily I can go to church (or mosque or synagogue - and yes I do go) - I just got a bit tired of the historical homily. Yes I know, I could have put the book down, no one forced me to read the book, nevertheless, I was hoping for something more."
4,The richness that was Medieval Spain,A first class read for any history buff. Right up there with 'The Ornament of the World' by Maria Rosa Menocal.
4,'No single tradition has monopolised every human expression of truth..',"This book is a great starting point in terms of understanding medieval Spain and appreciating the Iberian contribution to broader European enlightenment. Aptly subtitled 'Medieval Spain's Golden Age of Enlightenment', Chris Lowney draws us into the accomplishments of Muslims, Christians and Jews over seven centuries.Whether you choose to read this book as an historical statement of past accomplishments, or as a sign of hope for a more co-operative future, it provides a wonderful view of the golden age of the Iberian peninsula.The book has a wealth of notes and suggested readings for those who would like to obtain more information about specific events or achievements.Highly recommended to those interested in learning more about medieval Spain as well as those looking for instances of shared learning.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,Warning about charging batteries for this tool,"I own one of these tools that came in a three-piece package deal and really like it. The problem is that Skil designed the battery charger for this tool without an automatic shut off and that is why I rated this tool as a 3. The result is that I now own a cordless drill, a cordless flashlight and a cordless circular saw that I can no longer use until I spend almost as much money as I spent when I purchased this package originally for replacement batteries because the charger would not shut off and overcharged the batteries, resulting in premature death of the batteries. If you are disciplined enough to take the charger off after three hours of charging then I would recommend this tool 100%. If not, then I would recommend that you buy an electric timer to turn the charger off after three hours. In that case, I would also recommend this tool 100%."
4,"Not totally perfect, but well worth the read","I love the character of Sage Shepard, and think her story would make a really cool movie. If you go to youtube and search Primal Tears, you'll find a video I made on my ideas for such a movie. The overall book wasn't totally perfect, but I think Kelpie did a pretty good job. Also, if you visit deviantart.com (look up Cedar Woods, or Primal Tears) you'll find artwork based on my ideas for a Primal Tears movie."
3,Too much,"I ordered this book because I like Kelpie Wilson's writing for Truthout. When I read it I found myself disappointed; not because of the subject matter but because of the story line. Kelpie has this girl ""over the top"" and she didn't have to do that; the story would have been more interesting toned down a bit."
4,Fundamentals of cognition,Very well structured. Easy to understand. Good list of further reading. If the author can include some diagrams at the beginning of each section to give an overview of the section - that is going to be even greater!
4,Cooling Blue Skin Bracer,"I like this product ... it is refreshing to splash it on after shaving, I never have any discomfort, and it smells great! Best of all, my wife likes the smell, too!"
5,"It took me a while, but....","This is a really fabulous album. By and large, it is a documenting of Caetano's emotional rollercoaster during his exile from Brazil. Musically, it is a considerable departure from anything Brazilian. This is really about Caetano, his life crisis, and the obvious influence British Isles music was having on his work. This album really bears no similarity to his previous work, regardless of language. The 1969 white album was all over the place, and this album, partly because there are only 7 songs, is more focused. Maria Bethania and Shoot Me Dead are my favorites. There is great similarity with this album and Transa, the follow-up. I know many fans swear by Transa, but right now, I'm leaning on the '71 album as the stronger package. You can't go wrong either way."
4,Real music for real listeners,"OK, if you know your jazz, feel your folk and dig your deep lyrics, this little Brasilian (made in London) gem will not dissapoint.I discovered Caetano through the Gilles Peterson Worldwide show. The stand out track is 'Hot sun of a Christmas day' and was the reason for my purchase. The album has 2 other cool tracks.The vibe is dreamy, organic, rich and dark. Great for a stormy afternoon indoors.It is a must for all Brasilian jazz-folk collectors, the original vinyl I believe goes for considerably more!"
5,Great movie!!,"I fell in love with this movie 30 years ago, found it here, and fell in love all over again. I have to put this in my top 5 movies of all time. if I were to be stranded on an island with 5 movies this would be one of them. If you remember your first love and how it felt, this will remind you of the feeling. Rex Smith is his gorgeous self and Denise Miller is the average young girl with first love on her mind. 30 years has taken away nothing from this film, although being reminded of how we dressed then sure has its downside, HA HA"
4,LOVE THIS BOOK & MOVIE FROM THE PAST,i read the book at least about 10x and now they have the movie that was on tv in the 70s on again. ilove it. thanks
5,Still love this movie!,"Saw this in the late 70s as an afterschool special. Loved it then, still love it. Actually I only saw this once or twice back then. Have been looking for it ever since! Thank you for selling the DVD!"
5,Sooner or Later,I loved this coming of age movie. I watched it when it first came out on tv. I have it on vhs and now on dvd.A country girl from MaineSooner or Later
5,Loved this movie when I was a teen!,"I never forgot this little movie, it's the kind that gets under your skin and you dont forget so always kept my eyes peeled for when it might be reissued. I am so glad to have found it! When it first came out when I was about 19 I watched it over and over, I just loved it and it was a wonderful story, Denise Miller, who portrayed the female lead is sadly a much overlooked and forgotten actress - who works now as a Makeup Artist in LA. I just saw her a few months ago and she is still one of the most attractive ladies around, and super nice too."
5,Blast from the Past,You will never see this movie on TV or cable so its worth it to buy this.. Loved this movie from start to finish
3,Aaaah Rex Smith and teenage 1st Love!,This movie came out when I was....ahem....around 13. The same age as Jessie in the film. It's a sweet film.
3,Sooner or Later,"As ""cheezy"" as I remembered it from my girlhood. I loved every moment. What is better than going back in time in your own life, if only for the duration of a movie."
1,Disappointed,"Had not previously ordered DVDs from here but still expected a decent product for the money. Just received my order and have to say I am truly disappointed with the quality of the items, despite these being older movies. Put in the first DVD and a very poor quality ""menu"" image came up. No opening credits on the DVD - just went straight to the first scene. Truly disappointed in the poor, grainy picture quality and sloppy packaging of this product. True that you get what you pay for. I will NOT order anymore DVDs from here."
2,"How about Much, Much Later?","Wow. I haven't seen a flick this corny in ages. What prompted me to order it was actually a childhood memory. It aired on cable TV one night when I was in 1st or 2nd grade and I wasn't allowed to watch it. Hencefore I was ever curious. I came across the book in 7th grade and for some reason it became one of my favorites. I have been scanning the TV Guide off and on for like, 20 years waiting for it to air again. There was, however, a reason it didn't. I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon, but it's really pretty cheesy. But if you're not too squeamish and up for a giggle sit back, drink a White Russian and enjoy the feathered hair, coral lipgloss, and skintight Sergio Valentes."
4,Sooner Or Later,I had seen this movie when I was a kid and LOVE it. I had such a crush on Rex Smith after seeing this movie. I had rented it for a movie night with my girlfriends and we laughed at how funny it was and remembered how we thought it was the best movie ever. It is a good movie to add to my DVD collection
4,Blast from the past,I hadn't seen this movie since it first came out - it brought back many memories for me. Enjoy the retro clothing and music in this classic love story!
4,"Good, but not flawless","This book is a good, basic guide to South Beach Diet-friendly foods. It would be perfect if it had fiber counts included, to help the reader have a better idea of net carbs consumed."
4,This is a good buy but a bit pricey,This is a great buy if you can buy it used. I think it is helpful with the diet and also just basic information. I started looking into this diet because of the effect it has on blood sugar. I find this diet a bit easier to do than Atkins. This book is a good resource to have when on this diet.
1,Not Complete or Easy...,"This is the most complete waste of money I have seen in quite some time. I am on the South Beach Diet and doing well. Love the diet! This book however, is loaded with foods to AVOID.... Duh! Like I have to have a detailed list of doughnuts to avoid... I think not! The reviews ahead of this book touted that it would be helpful for those of us finding ourselves in a restaurant or fast food situation. The best it does for the pitiful few of these types of foods it bothers to list is AVOID.... Well, my advice is to AVOID this book and save your money.... Common sense is a much better weapon against carbs and it doesn't cost you as much as this book will. I am going to sell my copy and try to recoup my loss. This is obviously a rush to print, costly little piece of fluff that misses the marks all round. How disappointing to actually see the contents of the book.... AFTER I bought it. Dr. you can do better and you should...."
1,Missing much information,"This book leaves much to be desired. Even though it is advertised as being ""complete"", it is far from that. It is missing many normal foods. Also, it does not list the amounts of fiber, saturated fats or cholesterol. It recommends many foods to avoid that are recipes in Dr Anatston's own books. Not worth the money."
5,pretty good diet book.,"I like the recipes, the food, the technique. Works without having to starve and get to love what you love. But, it's difficult because I love carb stuff . Man, only if they can make carbless stuff all over, that would be fantastic!"
2,save your money,"The book can be purchased at discount stores for under five bucks. It was a fad. It's over. They got my money, don't give them yours."
1,Better to hit the gym and not this book,"If people would just eat right and hit the gym four times a week, they would lose weight.Instead, people are bypassing normal common sense and going for these fad diets.It makes the authors rich, and the readers fatter."
2,garbage,thin plastic garbage that will not stay on or lay flat. this is a waste of money. the manufacturer will not even stand behind this product. actually between amazon and the manufacture i did not get anywhere when trying to get them replaced.
2,seemed nice at first,"I got these for christmas about 6 months ago. Installation went smoothly with the simple directions. I was skeptical to the fact that only a few strips of double sided 3m tape included would hold these on after enduring things like cold temperatures, snow, highway speeds, rain, and hot sun beating down on them, let alone things bumping and slamming down on them (which is what they are built for, right?) Well, here I am 6 months later and one flew off on the freeway about a week ago and the other one is wobbling. They look nice, but that's about it. Pretty expensive for 2 pieces of plastic that will eventually find themselves a home in the wind shield of the car behind you."
3,Average,This is yet another installment in this series. While I thought these books were moderately funny in the beginning - they are starting to feel boring to me.The storyline is essentially the same with the girls trying to find their soulmates - while at the same time trying to matchmake everybody in their school.The problem with this book is the corny dialogue. The whole opening chapter with them being interviewed was just so painful to read. The author seemed to be trying to be cute and funny and the result was that the characters simply sounded stupid. This is a theme that would repeat over and over throughout this book. I think its time to retire this series.
5,My Opinions,"When I went to Japan on an exchange program all I had on my head was anime and the anticipation of buying all I could. When I got to an electronics store I came upon this CD and bought it immediately. I have the say its an awesome CD with tracks from older gundam series, gundam wing, and even a few from Endless Waltz. It looks particulary amazing with its well illustrated booklet with all song descriptions in japanese. But in japan It was only 2000 yen, about 20 dollars american to buy one. It seems to me Amazon is has overpriced it a tad too much O.o but its still worthwhile to get this memorable CD from one of the best drama series next to Evangelion"
5,I'M GLAD KATE IS HERE!,"I loved the poetry that outlined the story. Kate, whom we first met in ""Through My Window"" is the central figure in this story. Bright and outgoing, Kate speaks her mind on a myriad of subjects such as her religious identity, her social concerns and people she encounters regularly.This book delighted me because Kate is such a strong, female protagonist. She's wonderfully believable and her voice is certainly heartfelt. Kate is also funny."
5,Looks great on my mini cooper!,I LOVE my union jack license plate! It looks so cool on my already cool looking mini cooper!
5,The Union Jack,"Being an ex patriot, having the Union Jack on our cars which are both American, We are showing love of both countries .Proud to be American and still a Britt at heart.."
1,An OK album,"I'm sorry to say that there are no major hits from this album. Andrew Gold's contract with Asylum records expired after he recorded this album(this one is his fourth). Gold was one of the musical guests on NBC's Saturday Night Live on May 24,1980,the last show for the remaining original cast. Gold performed KISS THIS ONE GOODBYE. He probably was on ""home base"" with the cast when they took their final bows. Gold even briefly dated actress Laraine Newman,who was one of the original remaining SNL cast."
1,Not Widex NanoCare wax guards,Be careful - the item we received were not Widex NanoCare wax guards (Widex NanoCare wax guards are the item pictured in the item). We did receive wax guards - just not the correct ones!
2,too large for my hearing aids,I am not sure if I ordered wrong or if the one I needed are no longer being manufactured. I thought theses we the correct ones.
3,No longer use them,Got theme for my old hearing aids. Just like the ones I bought from the hearing aid dealer for $10. Got new aids so won't be using the remainder.
2,Wax guard purchase review.,"I have two hearing aids so I am a regular consumer of wax guards. I think for what you get, a small plastic stick, the price is extremely too high! I purchased these items in August, 2012."
4,pretty good,"It's a good book. I'm glad to have it. But I'm only giving it 4 stars, not 5. To me - not as mind blowing as some of the other people have said. I found some information not useful, but the other half is quite useful and going through the whole book is giving me confidence in my servers."
5,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters were interesting, and it was fun to read. I appreciate clean stories with a nice ending. Keep the good books coming Mr. Kritlow!"
5,Laura's Star,The origional was special to my granddaughter so this was a special Xmas delight for us both! Very good book!
5,Photographic Masterpiece,"Polvo de aquellos lodos is a photographic portrait of the life and times of the northern Mexican bourgeoisie at the end of the XIX century and the beginning of the XX. Selected from the Sandoval Collection (Sandoval had a portrait studio) they show the many facets of a town that would become the second industrial power in the country.Through a series of expertly chosen photographs we get a much richer sense of what life was like at the beginnings of modernity than with the use of a dry text. Fashion, technology and provincial life all converge in this book, rich in detail and description. There is no greater joy than to take a magnifying glass and experience a time, which history has transformed into dust."
2,poor quality,"After some moderate usage this product began to fall apart with nuts and bolts falling off. It looked like a reasonable quality product when I bought it but there were no reviews. With this review, there are 2 and they say about the same thing: Look elsewhere"
4,"Cool, Cool Norman Brown","It was always clear from his background vocals and scats that jazz guitarist Norman Brown could sing. And on West Coast Coolin', his slick, macking on ""I Might"" and the mature, articulate croons of ""Angel"" expose a charming facet of his artistry. Still, Brown's vocals dance in unison with his sprightly guitar, a manifestation of George Benson's influence. His guitar strums speak emotions loud enough to feel on standout instrumentals like ""Missin' You."" When he abandons an established melody for a freestyle jaunt, as on the breezy groove ""Up 'N' At 'Em,"" Brown is at his best."
3,A Disappointed Norman Brown Fan,"In the past I have purchased Norman Brown's CDs without listening to sample tracks - NO MORE! For me, Norman Brown's vocal performances mar some very good instrumental work (I have the same issue with Paul Brown and Nathan East and recent Fourplay CDs). The instrumentals rate 4 to 5 stars.I remain a Norman Brown supporter but I will be more cautious when he releases his next CD."
2,full of vocals and drum. where is the jazz?,I hope someone will let these artistes know that the fans are not interested in hearing vocals on a supposedly jazz album.
3,What happened to Christian Living?,"This book takes the elements of feely awkward when shareing your faith and turns it around to feely confident. Often Christians talk to unbelievers about God before Christians talk to God about unbelievers. This guide takes you on a journey that changes one's own personal life before trying to change others. It is a necessary tool for every Christian to implement into there lifestyle. Mary calls it the Prayer, Care, Share principles."
1,Waste of Money!,"Mary Marr's book is a complete waste of money and time. It does not address issues in which she indicates. From my vantage point, it made absolutely no sense at all. I do not think the principles in this book could be used in real life and you should not force people to be converted to Christianity. Instead of buying this book, donate to charity to really convert people. Show people your faith in doing onto others."
1,Didn't focus on the poor and oppressed.,"I didn't like this book for a few simple reasons. First of all the book kept stating how important it was to save the unsaved but how does the reader know who is truly saved or not only God knows that. This book made it sound like you had to make people believe your way or they were not saved. It did not talk about other religions and how to respect them. I think this book would have been much better if it had taught the reader to be charitable to people of all different religions instead of forcing people to believe what they want to believe. Also, I was saddened that the author didn't have an opportunity to really help economically oppressed poor people. The book didn't even talk about these hardships and show us how to help these unfortunate souls overcome their barriors."
1,A Superficial Reading,I was interested in readings books about how to spread God's Word. I had a desire to learn about spreading the Word to minority groups. Lighting the Way seemed superficial and was filled with chocolate frosting that did not portray the reality of the world. My suggestion is that Mary L. Marr visit a third world country and help those in need while trying to spread the Word.
1,reader from Arizona,"This is book is the biggest peice of crap I have ever read in my life. I know Mary Marr personally and she is a religious hyprocrite. She hurts many people and then pretends like she is ""a Christian""."
5,Ken Follett never disappoints,"I've read most, if not all, of Ken Follett's book and this one is a winner. Written in the suspenseful style that he's famous for, he keeps you interested to the very end."
5,The best of Follett.,"From one page to the next, you're always right in the middle of the action. Written almost totally ''behind'' enemy lines, the pace is spell-binding while and at the same time gives you a unique look into the Enemy itself"
4,"Likeable characters, exciting twists, Good read.","I like Ken Follett, and this is no exception. The characters are interesting, the story believable, and there are enough twists to make this whole story an enjoyable read.In this book, Follett's villain was a likeable character. In other books, Follett's portrayal of the villain caused the reader to dislike him. But in this one, Franck was a likeable villain, and the reader almost cheers for him, especially with his clashes with the Gestapo.If I was forced to criticize the book, it would be regarding the ending. Of course we know that the good guys win before even starting, but the sabatoge story and the subsequent stories (details omitted so as not to ruin the story), went too fast, and without many things going wrong for the Jackdaw team.But I enjoyed it. It was an entertaining read."
4,"Ken Follett tries his hand again at featuring a female hero,","and succeeds. Follett recaptures the spirit and willingness to take risks of the British, American, and French Resistance spies and soldiers during WWII. In Flick, a female British spy, we find a careful woman who courts danger. Married to Michel, of the French Resistance, Flick has been drawn into espionage by her love, but is practical enough to realize that Michel has feet of clay in the relationship department.Follett's story tells of Flick's determination to lead a female group of spies on a critical mission in the days before the invasion. They must take out a critical German post, and Flick is forced to use amateurs on her most important mission. Follettbuilds the suspense to its most critical in telling the tale, and does not spare romance or sadness in its conclusion.Although Follett is fairly predictable in his writing, and his telling is straight-forward, without many interesting sidelines, the story is enjoyable and well told."
2,He should write about something he knows about,"As an aficionado of epsionage books (fiction and non) i must say it was an ""ok"" book, but that author really doesnt have much of an idea about the SOE/OSS or resistance during WWII, nor is he good at description of the characters or how they act, maybe he should stick to whatever he normally write, Espionage books are definately not his speciality."
3,Readable WWII story,"This was a more than passable WWll yarn set just prior to the Normandy invasion. Only a few ""Yeah, that could happen"" scenes detracted from the story line."
3,Jackdaws- an easy Follett read,"First, let me say I liked the read of Jackdaws by Ken Follett. I have read a lot of his works though, and I would not say it is his best work. Compared to most writers though, even a weak effort by Follett goes a long way towards greatness. Generlly, I get a much better feel for the era or the history of a piece from him. This was just not rife with the history as usual for him.I will say that bhe did dress the story up with drama though. He is an excellent portryer of characters and the good and bad guys where the right color hats throughout the book. But, I will say that the contrasting conscience builds slowly towards lrge pictures of desperation as well in this book. I wish there had been more.In fact, I wish Follett had given more throughout this story. I felt as though Tarentino had taken short cuts to rewrite history for the sake of character and thrills a little. Agood beginner for Follett, but maybe a little less so for avid fans."
3,Loved the beginning....something got lost in the middle....,"At the beginning, I was pulled into the story of women operating from behind enemy lines during WWII. The action was brisk, the plot was driven by interesting characters, and I was looking forward to finding how it all played out.However, something got lost in the middle of this story and I found it hard to finish.I think the author missed a golden opportunity to tell the JACKDAWS' story. Maybe the real truth was better than a 'fictionalized' re-telling of their story.Oh, well."
4,Jackdaws,"JackdawsI am a keen reader of Folletts work. Even though they all give similar flavor in different wrapping, I think his ability keep the reader on the tip toes must be commendable.Jackdaws refers to a time when Allies were on putting final touches to the invasion of Europe. The main character named ""flick"", with remarkable endurance did the most damages to Germans before the invasion. They hit the heart of the German Communications, that connected the rest of Europe with Nazi HQ.Storey is full of suspense the typical spy stuff even more it has a human angle to it as well. The author has added several twists to the story by way of adding several love and hate scenes to the picture. There is a similarity in this love and hate in Jackdaws as well as in ""Lie down with Lions"".All in all JACJDAWS is a yet another excellent work from Ken Folletts."
2,don't expect too much,it felt like the perfect book for an 8th grader - simple plot and writing style. and then he throws in a few scenes of violence and torture to make it more adult-like.
