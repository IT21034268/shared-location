4,Very enjoyable read,"This was my first book by this author and I really, really enjoyed it. The book had a ton of heart. Highly recommend and I'm going to buy more from her."
5,A Remarkable Woman of This Age,"I happened to read this book once before. This copy was in excellent shape, and came with a note to the previous owner of the book by the author herself. In reading it and after attending a workshop by the author, it is truly thrilling and inspiring to actually take in what she has done for orphans and other forgotten peoples in devastating circumstances. The fascinating part is that she goes to be with persons victimized in the midst of desperate situations like wars and famine; She helps families who have had members stolen into slavery in devastated villages. She provides aid where few will dare to go, often risking her own life. She goes to many places that today's newsmedia choose to ignore. Very enlightening."
1,"""WILD GOOSE CHASES OF THE SOUTHWEST""","I selected 3 natural hot springs to visit during my last vacation. Of those 3, NONE WERE OPEN! You can imagine the disappointment after driving hundreds of miles. This is in addition to low-quality black/white pixely photos, low-quality maps, and extremely general directions. If you do acquire this book, I would recommend using another guide and good maps as a supplement to enhance and clearify any real substance you might chance upon."
3,Getting Warm,I found this book to be usefull if I used it with other sources. It was a good starting point but a lot of the information in it is out dated. After a long drive I found that a free site was now a pay site and I had not brought the cash to get in. However it was a great starting point and with a search on the internet it was a good help
3,Good Batteries,"Well, like most Monster products, this is a high quality product that is overpriced. I really wish the other people writing reviews didn't feel the need to write in caps with exclamation points all over the place.These are not the highest powered batteries, the newer Kodak Max 1850 mAh ones are. They are also cheaper. These Monster batteries are good, just not the best, or best value.For those interested in battery/charger combos:The Kodak Max 1850 mAh do not currently come bundled with their K2000 charger(they bundle the 1700s).Monster does bundle their 1800 mAh batteries with their charger.Kodak's charger can charge all 4 batteries at the same time, while Monster's can only charge 2 at a time. Monster's comboalso costs more than Kodak.Just some pros and cons to think about. I personally feel Kodak is a better value."
5,High capacity for digital photography,"Digital cameras eat batteries, period. With 4 of these in my Fuji, I took over 200 flash pictures at a party without a problem. I never had to get out my set of spares. That's the way it is; that's the way it should be. Highly recommended."
1,Usefull Information,"I bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging. It was not true to what was said. These batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera. And a set of Duracell Ultras, that are not rechargeable, lasted longer. Do not always believe what you read. Make sure you have the ability to return items. And is with this case, they went back. I went with a set of energizers. And they last much longer, with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand."
3,A great book of short stories.,"This is a fascinating colletion of stories of the future of human kind. If you like science fiction, you'll love ""The Book of Frank Herbert""."
3,"Good, but beware if you have the first Magnet Marketing","This book has excellent ideas to get you to think long term about marketing and position. There are specific suggestions for attracting and retaining customers. HOWEVER, if you own the original Magnet Marketing, don't be fooled into thinking the New Magnet Marketing has new concepts. In fact, it is the EXACT SAME book with a few words changed to update it. ALL the chapters, concepts, etc... are virtually word for word the original Magnet Marketing. If you never read the original, you can use this. If you have the original, don't bother."
1,cat sitter 2 is for the birds...,"I bought Cat Sitter1 for my 3 cats, they enjoyed it so much I gave Cat Sitter 2 a go. What a disappointment!!They were bored within 5 minutes of it being on! The entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to Cat Sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments. Trust me, if you have to choose between the two, don't spend your money on on CS2, however, it may appeal to the (human) avid bird watcher...(?)"
4,"Cats love it, flat screen TV needs secured to wall though","My three cats love this DVD, they'll sit and watch the entire thing in one sitting. The birds are realistic, so much so that one of our cats actually jumped INTO the TV screen trying to hunt the bird.... needless to say, securing your TV prior to viewing might be a good idea.Good things:-The DVD loops so you can leave it on all day if you wanted-The pictures are clear and the sound is nice-Human sub-titles are available if you want to watch w/ your catBad things:-The screen shots change quickly so if you have attentive cats like we do they don't have a lot of time to stalk their prey-The 2nd part of the DVD with the fire-fly chasing thing is kinda lame, the cats are not interested at allOverall, I give it a 4 and would suggest the DVD to friends."
3,CatSitter II,"I bought CatSitter and it was excellent. So, I ordered DVD's 2 and 3 of the same series. CatSitter III is great, but they kinda missed the ball on CatSitter II. My cats don't like it nearly as much as the other DVDs in the series"
2,Not impressed,I was expecting much more from this video. Only part of interest was the birds and they were short and not particularly well done.
5,My Cats Love it!,"My cats watched it constantly--now we are giving it a rest! I would like to find another one, just a bit different for them ,so that we could alternate viewings. As a matter of fact they now watch regular TV ,waiting for their film to come on , no doubt!"
1,Cat bored with this DVD,"We thought our cat would love this DVD but we were very disappointed. He did take notice of the birds and came up to the screen to watch closely for a minute or two but that was it. Every time we turn it on, he takes notice for a minute or two. It's too much money to pay for something that interests him for such a short time."
3,Great entertainment for defense workers,"Perhaps not for the masses, but anyone who has been involved with ther defense industry in the 70's and 80's will appreciate this ""only slightly exagerated"" depiction of life in a defense company. I watched this movie about 6 times, one for each round of lay-offs at my previous employer, and laughed harder each time."
1,Murphy's First Big-Screen Disaster,"""The worst movie ever done in the history of anything."" - Eddie MurphyParamount paid Eddie Murphy a cool million to help salvage a failed Dudley Moore comedy. However, nothing can save ""Best Defense"" (1984) from its sheer awfulness. Except for a brief James Brown imitation, Murphy delivers zero laughs as the film's ""Strategic Guest Star."" (Ironically, Eddie and Dudley's only scene together ended up on the cutting-room floor.) Writer-director Willard Huyck was later responsible for the notorious ""Howard the Duck."" Take the money and run, indeed."
1,Best movie start ever -- worst rest of movie ever,"This opening scene is some of the best comedic writing ever -- but the rest of the movie is completely forgettable. So -- rent it, watch the first 5 minutes, then stop before you are irreparably damaged...."
1,"Believe it or not, l liked Best Defense","Too bad Dudley Moore has passed. l would've loved to have seen Best Defense 2. Sure, he did another Arthur movie, but he couldn't do this. TAKE ME T0 THE M0VlES BlTTERMAN!!!"
1,BEST DEFENSE MORE LIKE WORST DEFENCE,"NO SERVERE AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL CAN RENDER THIS FILM BARIBLE OR ENJOYABLE ABOUT A DEFENSE INDUSTRY DESIGNER WHO INADVERTANLY AQUIRE BLUEPRINTS FROM THE KGB. EDDIE MURPHY WAS AN ABSOLUTE MISCAST IN THIS FILM AND ITS PROBALEY THE WORST FILM OF HIS CARRER. AT LEAST `THE GOLDEN CHILD` DIDN`T PUT ME TO SLEEP LIKE THIS FILM DID. BESIDES I DIDN`T SEE MUCH CHEMEISTY BETWEEN MOORE AND MURPHY ANYWAY, THEIR ACTING WASN`T UP TO PAR IN THIS MEDIOCRE FILM, A WASTE OF MURPHY`S TALENT."
1,Kindle Version = No CD,"Looks like a very good book, but the licks are difficult. I really needed to hear the audio CD to get the phrasing and appropriate tempos for the licks. The Kindle version does not contain the audio that is on the CD. If they want to sell the book as a digital download, there should be a place to download the accompanying audio. My 1 star rating applies only to the Kindle download. I'd think the hard copy with CD should be very useful."
5,Very Good,"I really like this book. It has some very useful licks for playing country guitar. The book is well organized and easy to understand and the licks have all kinds of different flavors and speeds to them. You can tell this book was written by someone who knows country music. So far, this book is my favorite for learning licks from."
3,"Interesting, entertaining, but not amazing","This movie was very interesting and creative. All three of the stories made very good points and the acting was fine considering I didn't recognize any of the actors. It held my attention well throughout.I think this falls into the category of experimental movies. It's one of the movies where at the end you go, ""That was interesting."" You think about it a little bit longer, and then you move on. It's not the kind of movie anyone would go out and buy to re-watch it over and over.Worth a view, though."
3,An uneven experimental film,"""Poison"" was an early film by Todd Haynes and contains three stories about bizarre lives, namely: a doctor who ingested a deadly sex hormone that left him disfigured and highly contagious, a suburban nightmare about a masochistic/saintly child who killed his father, and a prison story by Genet. The prison story was the least experimental and most successful of the three. Haynes explored the power games, sexual needs, and embittered lives of the inmates and the strange way love was defined by those involved. The doctor's story was extremely melodramatic and the suburban story was mainly about the strange personalities inhabiting the neighborhood. All things considered it was, and probably was intended to be, an exploration of just how abnormal normal can be in some circumstances. Not an enjoyable picture, but it was thought provoking."
4,Early Todd Haynes masterpiece,"Beautiful, spare, elegant cinematography pared with a sophisticated marriage of irony, sincerity, homage and synthesis -- so exquisitely pomo it's heartbreaking.The connections between the three narratives aren't immediately obvious; repeated viewings make this film all the more rich.But then those thinking about buying this DVD probably don't need me to convince them.Anyone who's given this film one star is clearly being dismissive (and hasty) not critical."
1,Dont take Poison,"I don't like to give up, but Poison wins. I very much hope that those who see this film first will still be willing to watch Haynes 'Safe', one of the most interesting films I've ever seen.Those who praise this one offer no particularly creditable reasons. Parts of the homosexual segments are damned sexy, maybe the rest was thrown in as window dressing.Don't say I haven't warned you."
3,Question,"It is rather a question, I don't know how to do it through another way.Has the DVD subtitles in Spanish? I want my friends that can't understand English to see this movie. Thank you"
5,Amazing health information for everyone,"This book gives so much information about biochemical processes in the human body, that most people will benefit from it. I have never had a baby, yet it was incredibly helpful to me. I've bought this book as a gift for many friends and I highly recommend it."
5,Subtle and touching!,"I found this book by chance in Karacht years ago and I was really deeply moved by the wonderful stories written by Mr Bond. Most of my students also find the stories charming and touching. If I had to keep only one book for the rest of my life, this of course is the ONE."
3,Batteries,I purchased this item to be in one package of 12 and it came in three packages of 4. Sorry but I like to get what I saw (purchased) online!
2,Not what I ordered!,"I ordered 2 12 pack resealable AA battery packs. I received 4, 6 pack blister packs. I got no notification of a product alteration. The batteries are fine, the expiration dates are 2012, but I have to deal w/ 4 packs instead of 2 neat sealable containers. Petty, I know, but I wanted what I ordered..."
3,Jeep gasket,"This was the wrong gasket. The gasket arrived quickly, and new as described. Need to check the vehicle application and make corrections."
5,awesome BBQ sauce,"I love this sauce, it is, as another reviewer noted more runny than most other sauces, but that is a good thing. It doesn't get the gluey, sticky feel of many others and it has no high-fructose corn syrup (the first ingredient in a lot of others). This brand has extra-hot versions, but I like the original one the best."
1,"Terrible Book, and Terrible Author","I had the luxory of using this book, and also the great honor of being taught by the ""great man"" himself, who has written this 120 dollar peace of trash. The book is terrible, when trying to read through the proofs in each section, halfway through the proof it says ""this part is left as an exercise""and an even excersise none the less, I mean if your gonna go through a proof make it COMPLETE, don't tell me its an easy exercise, thats BS, now thats the book, now ill leave you to imagine how terrible of a proffesor he was, let me just say this, i love mathematics, and im planning on concentrating in crpytography, but that SOB Mollin, has me reconsidering the hole thing all together, i'd rather quit the concentration than to have to even open that textbook again and sit through one of his lectures. Whatever you do, don't buy this book, and stay away from Mollin, and if you have to take a class with Mollin, i would deffinitely buy a secondary textbook"
3,workable spare mat,"not ideal for daily sadhana. decent blocks and strap, but i'd only use the mat as a backup; only one side is sticky, too thin really, stays rolled up. on the upshot, it's lighter than most mats."
5,Better than I imagined,This was the first time I have ever bought books online and I am quite impressed with the quickness that the books came and also the super shape in which the books were in.
5,Excellent and comprehensive introduction to intelligence and the US Intelligence Community,"Dr. Lowenthal has done an excellent job of introducing the reader to the field of intelligence in general (what it is, what it isn't), and to the United States' Intelligence Community in particular. He devotes a few chapters to the broad topic of intelligence and its history, the current makeup and structure of the Intelligence Community (IC) in the United States, and future iterations and problems for the IC (particularly in the United States), then transitions into an in-depth discussion of the various aspects of intelligence, such as collection disciplines, analysis, and policy implications. I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the field of intelligence, from a novice to a seasoned analyst."
4,A new standard elementary text,"This is an excellent elementary text for the average college student. Over-all it is strong on issues of analysis, policy, and oversight, and weak on collection, covert action, and counterintelligence. The chapter on collection has a useful figure comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the five collection disciplines, and but does not get into the detail that this aspect of the intelligence community-80% of the annual expense-merits."
3,Hard to read,"The print in this book is amazingly tiny and hard to read. The pages are very small, making it very portable. I appreciate a little color or some illustrations in my textbooks, so this was a little dry for me. It is evident the writer knows what he is talking about, but I'm not sure he expresses it as clearly or neatly as he could."
1,Avoid it,"As videogame guides go, Prima always claims that they author totally unauthorized guides. It shows. The illustrations are horrible in all of thenm, the maps are terrible, and overall, the tips just plain suck. But this is the worst of them. It gives away all the secrets, and tells you the ending, which I enjoyed finding out for myself. I bought the Versus books strategy guide instead, and it didn't tell you about the final battles, keeping them secret for you to find out. Overall, Prima should be avoided at all costs, as their books are flat, dul, and bland. Versus books have great strategies, don't give away the plot, and are so freaking funny, you'll laugh so hard at the jokes it hurts."
3,More of the Same,"This movie, in the interest of being ""fair and balanced"", presents a female-to-male sex change operation. It also has some grisly scenes of carnage from around the world. It made me feel grateful to be sitting in the quiet comfort of my living room, seeing things that I hope never to experience in real life. This is really strong stuff."
5,Accounting with Rachlin and Sweeny,"I highly recommend the Rachlin and Sweeny book. As a professor of accounting at a major university in Florida, I teach accounting to both accounting and nonaccounting majors. I am particularly impressed by two features of this book. First, it presents the basic concepts of accounting and finance in an easy to read format without compromising technical accuracy. Second, and more importantly, it shows the reader how to use these basic concepts in making business decisions. The result is an interesting (yes,interesting!) and effective presentation. My compliments to the authors!"
2,Dry,"Mr. Rachlin and Sweeny make no excuses for writting a dry book. ""The field of basic accounting and finance frankly offers little that is new or exciting."" Sorry, I just couldn't take this tone. Try the McGraw-Hill 36-Hour book for a more lively presentation of the basics."
2,Disappointed,"Probably part my fault but disappointed that only lotion came with product. Picture leads you to believe you are also getting the uv light. Bought product to do an experiment with my class and now I have to spend more money on light to make it work. Before you buy, make sure you read the description & don't go by picture only!!"
5,Great product,I got this product from globright.com and it is an excellent product for teaching hand washing training. Very bright and makes a real impact on the student.
1,ridiculously old school,"The concepts may be correct, but the presentation is absolutely ridiculous and SO out of date.......I was very disappointed."
4,wrong product,"Well, it is a pair of good shoes, but the problem all the accessories for these shoes are for the hard ground or out-door soccer, and I want to play in-door so that's not exactlly what I want. However, the returning system is convenient and fast so I think I will give some credit on that."
1,Leaks after a few months.,"I have a K-690 and it leaks at the handle. I've messed with it over and replace the valve which costs $15.20 from Kohler but it still leaks. Usually it is a slow drip but it varies depending on how long you've been letting it run. The rubber seals inside just don't seem substantial enough. There is too much plastic and not enough rubber to make a good seal. You can crank down the nut that hold the valve in place but it never gets a good seal.I wouldn't buy one again and now I may have to find a replacement. I'm going to let a plumber take a look at it but if it starts leaking again, that's then end of Kohler for me."
4,A good looking faucet that works well,"I've had this faucet installed for at least 2 years. It is big, but I have a large sink so it fits in my kitchen. I have it installed with the handle in the front so that it is easier to reach.The chrome does get water spots, so it needs to be wiped dry to look its best, which is my only complaint."
2,Pretty but not worth it...,I had this faucet installed when we remodeled our kitchen in 2003. It was brand new then. I loved the faucet's looks and functionality but...I have had to replace or repair the inards/cartridge twice in the last 8 years. My faucet leaks under the handle. I thought it was just me with my wet hands dripping down but after reading the reviews here I now know it's not me and my wet hands. I had the faucet repaired 2-3 years ago. I am now doing a second repair on the faucet. The cartridge and sleeve needs to be relaced. The plumber was able to get the cartridge easily but the sleeve will tabke 6-8 weeks because it's on backorder. I can't exactly live without the kitchen faucet that long. This second repair cost me close to $500 already and that's not including the sleeve.I expected the fauct to work without having so many problems so soon. Save your money and buy a better made kitchen faucet and replacement parts you can easily get!
2,Not to Great,The good news is after 5 years with this faucet I have had zero leaks. The bad news is that it is not the high quality faucet I was expecting. The head has never fit well against the arm and the rubber seal over the spray control has split after a couple of years of use. I was hoping for a better made product then what I got.
1,Premium Priced JUNK,"I did not purchase this faucet through Amazon, but I did have one installed in our mega kitchen remod nearly four years ago. This faucet for the premium is a piece of junk. First it started leaking around the push button for the spray adjustment within the first year. In the last year or so it has started to leak around the pivot connection on the faucet head.Finally I tried to fix it the other night. And bam I over tightened the faucet head and CRACK. The head of the faucet despite the nice Brushed Nickel finish is nothing but cheap-@ss plastic internally.Kohler is living off their name. JUNK!Kohler parts direct wants over $300 just for a replacement head. If thing had any real quality I might consider it, but for that price I think I am going to try a different faucet."
1,Overrated to the extremus,"I saw this movie in a theater in January of 1984, and if I never see it again for the rest of my life, I'll be a happy man. My loathing for this film knows no bounds. It's perhaps the most un-worthy film to ever be awarded the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, beating out much better candidates like ""The Right Stuff"" and ""The Big Chill"" that were nominated that year. As I was watching it, I kept saying to myself ""When does this get better?"" It never did, not once over its achingly long 131 minute running time. My former co-worker called this ""the movie where the mother and daughter talk on the telephone all the time."" Which it is. Throw in some infidelity and an incurable disease, and that summarizes this piece of nonsense on celluloid. Avoid this movie at all costs.A few months back, I actually tried to watch this on TV, to see if my opinion had changed over the years. Well, it did. I hated this movie even more. I didn't think that was possible."
1,"I Can't Come to Terms with How Bad ""Terms of Endearment"" Is!","I found this movie long and an extremely boring waste of time. Shirley MacLaine played Aurora, an abnoxious [person] who can't seen to find a boyfriend. Meanwhile, her daughter Emma, played by Debra Winger, is dying of cancer. One hour of this movie is taken up with Aurora's love affair, and the other is spent on Emma's problems with cancer. (just goes to show you that the director thought that Aurora's sexlife is more important than the death of her daughter). I heard so many reviews that this movie was ""astounding and breathtaking."" The only astounding thing about this movie was how long it took to finish.This movie is a new enductee of my hall of fame for being one of the WORST films of all time. I wish that there was a choice of putting zero stars up for this movie, because, frankly, it was just that bad. I would never wish on my worst enemy to have to watch this ... of a movie."
3,Isn't that special.,"Terms of Endearment starring Shirley MacLaine is considered a tearjerker and wonderful epic but I hate to say that statement isn't what I think as well. Although MacLaine's performace is almost flawless, it's Debra Winger who has an unlikable and disconnected performance, I can't stand to watch her in this movie, she makes it unbearable to feel sympathy for her. The relationship between mother and daughter is strained and even though they fight, in the end they do deeply love each other. This movie has a lot of uneven moments, it's too long and cliched. People love this movie but for me, it's just ok."
5,AHEAD OF ITS TIME,"This 1983 release was ahead of its time. It most definitely has a message for today's society. I did not so much GET it over twenty years ago when viewing it in the theater as I did when watching it on the DVD as a middle aged movie buff. Shirley MacLaine plays a somewhat flighty but still most desirable middle aged woman whose conflict with her sweet if not naive daughter, played by Debra Winger, is sometimes stormy but always loving. Jack Nicholson, as the next door neighbor, is outstanding as always and is a sleezy womanizing former astronaut who befriends Ms. MacLaine but by movie's end it is clear he loves her and is perhaps a changed man. A younger Jeff Daniels is convincing as Winger's cheating husband as is John Lithgow as the man taken with her innocent charms. This movie will make you laugh and cry and the musical score is one you will never forget. All serious movie buffs should have a copy of this."
5,The Best,"A perfect movie. Brilliantly written, acted, directed. It makes me sad but I still watch it over and over because it is incredible"
5,Tearjerker,"Awesome movie, get your kleenex! I saw this movie as a teenager and wanted to watch it again. It was as good as I remember!"
3,A disgrace to NASA astronauts...,"I have a really hard time believing that a former NASA astronaut would be that overweight, that adolescent, that much of a drunk, unmarried, no kids, AND living in River Oaks. Just too unrealistic. Diminishes the poignancy of the whole story..."
3,Make it through the first half and you'll be OK,"The first half of this movie is very slow. It is quite boring. But it picks up when Shirley McClain and Jack Nicholson got together. Overall, the acting was very good. However, the movie is not one you want to watch more than once."
3,one of the top rating films of da 80s,"i love this movie i remember first seeing it when i was around 12 i didn't no much about da movie but i know it was a good one have big stars like debra winger, shirely mcclain, jack nickolson, jeff daniels, and danny devito it any everything from great acting to comedy scenes and a little bit of action i like da part when jack got drunk during his date with shirely they both went drove on da shore when jack was on top of the car driving it with his feet and while shirely was in da driver's seat just having her foot on the pedal she had enough and let go of da pedal and jack few out of da car and into the water and got all his clothes wet then she went to see if he was alright and they kisses eachother but then jack went inside her shirt and she asked him ""why did you have to get drunk"" Jack angry replied ""I AM NOT DRUNK ANYMORE"" da movie has a one of da saddest endings i have ever seen watch to see what will make you cry JB"
2,I seem to prefer Brooks' TV work better...,"I really had a problem with this movie when it was released in 1983, and I still do. While I like James L. Brooks' TV work (""Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""The Simpsons"") I don't seem to love all his movies.When ""Terms"" first came out, it was praised as being SO moving and SO funny and SO real, you'll just die as fast as Debra Winger (and her subsequent career)... Well, that was just typical early-80s hyperbole, but this movie is about as real and as poignant as an episode of ""Little House on the Prairie""--- and about as funny.I suppose it's harmless enough, but there is nothing-- NOTHING-- superlative about it. (I will be in the minority here, I realize)."
5,really good film,this film is very well done.and well acted.the follow up wasn't as strong which is the usual case only the godfather is the exception.but this film maintains it's importance years after it's release.
1,"my mom loved it, bless her heart","The popularity of this film is one of life's great mysteries to me.I wanted to like it for Mom's sake. Alas, it came off like a third rate soap opera. See other one star reviews."
3,Miscast?,"It's been some years since I saw this movie and even more since I read the book. After reading McMurtry's novel, however, I could never imagine anyone except Elizabeth Taylor portraying Aurora on screen. And no one but Holly Hunter as Aurora's friend and housekeeper, Rosie. The film introduced the astronaut character (Jack Nicholson), probably because he is younger and sexier than his counterpart in the original story, retired General Hector Scott. (General Scott, while not as appealing to the movie-going public, is a better foil for the mature woman Aurora is supposed to be and is also a more original creation than the astronaut.) Still the movie, even with some significant changes, is interesting if only in comparison to the novel. Whatever else can be said about ""Terms of Endearment,"" it is vastly superior to its cloying film sequel, ""The Evening Star."""
2,overrated and overacted,"I missed this movie when it first came out and now I just can't understand what the hype is about. Aside from Debra Winger's excellent performance and uncanny resemblance to the lovely and talented Zooey Deschanel, it was difficult to see what the point was. The story had no real shape, the characters were a collection of tics, and it's horrifying that those children end up with a narcissistic monster."
4,"Very good, but predictable in a way.","This movie was a very good movie. I think it fully deserved its Oscar.The only thing that bothered me was how predictable the ending was.For me, Jack Nicholson was the highlight of the movie. He really was Shirley MacLaine's (character's) answer to her prayerI do recommend this movie, mostly to women. It is a ""tear-jerker"" i guess (thats the category my local Blockbuster put it in,, but it wasnt for me) and men don't seem to interested in those type of movies.So if you need a good cry, or if you wanna watch some good acting, check out ""Terms of Endearment"".~CandaceSeattle Reviewer..."
5,A Good Chemistry Film,"This film brought another moving roles for its star performers. Once again, Jack Nicholson has a role he was born to play."
2,Highly overrated.,"Never having seen this supposedly great film, I rented it the other day. It's not a bad film, but it's not a very good one, either. Very slow-moving, with only Jack N. to liven up the proceedings. Debra Winger's character was so annoying i was glad when she finally croaked. Shirley McLaine was OK, but not deserving of a Best Actress award. And Best Picture? I don't think so. Rent if you want, but prepare to be disappointed. By the way, it's not nearly as sad as everyone says it is."
2,Not for Me,I had to buy this film and watch it as a class requirement - didn't like it in the 980's and like it even less now.
4,"Somewhat cold, but still wonderful.","I saw this movie after I had seen Steel Magnolias, and to be honest it did not impress me as much as Steel Magnolias did. They are both classics in the film world, but I found Magnolias better and more heartwarming. Shirley Maclaine did a wonderful job acting in this film as the troubled mother of a sickly daughter. The movie comes together in the end but at some points the movie lacked that sense of heart and home that Steel Magnolias had. See it and make the judgment for yourself. I do reccomend it."
5,Best of the best,"This particular release is amazing! There is not one bad song throughout the entire cd. It is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over again and never get tired of it....now that's what I call a great record.For those of you who have never heard of Oingo Boingo, I would say they are a band that makes music that is almost impossible to describe. Their music is truly unique and is completely different from anything you've ever heard. Although there are a lot of bands that have their own sound, Oingo Boingo adds to their sound diversity by including the use of wind instruments. So I'll make an attempt and say Oingo Boingo is punk meets pop meets new wave meets brass meets weird, and that's about as close as I can get. So give them a listen, you won't be dissapointed."
4,Boingo's early hits,"Great selection of songs! I really enjoyed their early stuff in the beginning and this compilation tells the story. If you listened to their first three albums in the early 80's, these are the best tracks from them."
3,Start from the back,"The poems are arranged chronologically. I started at the front and got stuck - the language is thick and too abstracted for my taste. I almost gave up on him, but decided to read his later stuff before putting it down. I then read the book back to front and enjoyed his material from the 1960's the very best. I'm glad I didn't give up. My suggestion, start from the back."
4,"A Reading Of ""As I Walked Out One Evening""","Length:: 4:02 MinsThere are three speakers in this poem: The observant ""I"" of the first line and of the last stanza, the lover, and, the longest part, the personified chimes of the modern city clock, rebuking the Romantic lover. The chimes have the most famous and affecting lines, but, importantly, not the last word. What is the ""deep river"" in the last line that seems to encompass both chimes and lover? This question is for the reader to ponder on his/her own. Like all great poetry, particularly Auden's, the poem is nuanced and ambiguous."
4,Good Gift for New Yorkers,"New Yorkers are notorious for not being able to give directions. We know how to get there,just don't ask us for directions! This book gives specific address and phone #'s,subway maps and of course street locations (ie: cross streets for 1535 Broadway?It's in here).It is easy to use:shopping,restaurants,museums, movie theaters,houses of worship, etc; are classified according to uptown,downtown or midtown locales with numbered site maps. The size of the guide fits in a jacket pocket, or the newer,trendy horizontal sized purses ladies now carry.I've purchased my copy for use at my job.I may just change my rating to 5 stars"
1,Where was the editor?,"This book needed help; it was obvious that the publisher did not provide a decent editor for the author to work with. The plot was interesting, but poorly executed. The characters of Henry and Anne were turned into buffoons and the other major characters did not fare much better. Why use the year 2070 as a starting point if you are not going to have the imagination to envision a world different from today? Time travel is a stretch, but done right it can be very entertaining. The errors in tense and word usage just made the experience of reading this book even more difficult."
5,Excellent Book Combines Historical and Future Romance,"This was one of those books that I couldn't put down. The plot line is really a surprise when you get into the book, and you're always trying to figure out the next twist. I highly recommend this book for a great summer read."
3,"Damon Runyon Meets ""3 Penny Opera""","""You and Me"" (1938) is a genuine sleeper and a cult favorite among fans of director Fritz Lang. An offbeat, quirky mix of Damon Runyon and Kurt Weill (who wrote the music), this romantic comedy features George Raft and Sylvia Sidney in good form as an unlikely couple with a criminal past. Lang's expressionist style is evident during the Weill-inspired segments - a Hollywood interpretation of ""The 3 Penny Opera."" Though not for all tastes, ""You and Me"" is much better than its critical reputation would have you believe."
4,Kiss of Death meets The Music Man.,"Raft and Sidney are terrific. Fritz Lang's Expressionist direction, the snappy dialogue, the humor and the music make this little known film an absolute pleasure to watch."
5,A must have for practitioners of Dim Mak or Chinese Medicine,"This is an important reference book for those interested in Dim Mak, the deadliest Chinese martial art.Knowing the acupressure/acupuncture points is the basis for the lethal strikes of this art as well as the healing aspects that are an important part of it"
2,Not very good,"This material was collated some years ago, and although has some good conceptual stuff, has little practical value."
2,Broke,I think this brike quite quickly after purcahse but I didn't pay much ! Probably made in China
1,Pls take my advice...DNT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before.But the picture on the site and the product review looked good.When i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped.The pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished.I returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet.Its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time.
2,Flaky Eyeliner,"I don't particularly reccommend this product, as it flakes off. Although it is easy to apply, what good is it if it flakes?"
3,Good product but i hate the applicator brush,"This is the first natural liquid eyeliner I tried and although it was a good product, I did not re-purchase because of the applicator brush. It is soo thin and flimsy that it takes forever to get an even and moderately thick line. I am still in search of a great natural liquid eyeliner (please let me know if you know of any!), but for now I am usingPhysicians Formula 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner Ultra Blackand it works amazingly!"
4,These 20th Century Masters CDs Should Carry a Warning Label,"Let's keep this brief. Five stars for the music. Three stars for the value. Months after this Millennium release, MCA put out All Time Greatest Hits. Eighteen songs--including the two hits (""Monster"" and ""Straight Shootin' Woman"") not found here. Your music library should have some Steppenwolf in it--but this one ain't it."
3,For the casual fan,"I must admit, this is a pretty good collection, but you'll only be truly satisfied if you're a casual fan of Steppenwolf. Otherwise, buy the British import ""The Very Best of Steppenwolf"" or their entire collection."
2,Why rate your own stuff????,"This book fell short of my expectations. I'm not so sure about this author. She is just another person claiming these stupid powers. Which, in the end is really nothing more then figment of her imagination. Consistent with the blib blab... This book was more then blah! I'm sure this lady must have a screw loose. I guess for the few bucks this book would cost you and the time involved, I'd recommend spending that else where. Paranormal books are great.. This one stinks. Remember user reviews are everything... I kind of want my money back...FYI- rip off..."
1,Different Printed Version than Picture,"The book I received was different than the one pictured. It was printed by a small press, is very small, and isn't a of good quality. Normally a different cover and size wouldn't be such a big deal but this was a gift an it didn't look very thoughtful to give such a poorly made version."
1,Dissapointing and That's a Fact,"I was overcome with dissapointment after this staple to the lily b. collection. The first book was fun, interesting, and witty. This sequel I found dreary, tiring, and couldn't wait for it to end. With obvious foreshadowing you find yourself thinking how self centered the protagonist is. There were so many other great characters to marvel on, and yet Kimmel chose to center the story around a gum chewing, bad tempered, and dull male character. I love romantic comedies, but this one: a no go."
5,Best of Blackmarket....Nuff Said!,"This is a must for rap fans, it has Brotha Lynch Hung's Rip Gut style which is just breath taking! It has his cousin Mr. Doctor with his smooth style rippin it up for Sacramento too, then its got X-RaiDed tearin up tracks. Doomsday Productions are also on this. This album is amazing."
4,Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?,It is a very interesting book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about Dorothy Parker's life.
5,Reads and Reveals like an Autobiography,"The reader must approach this amazing biography with an open mind in order to truly comprehend the life of Dorothy Parker. Ms. Parker was a rebel of her time: she scoffed at the traditional housewife, laughed and exceeded men's expectations of women, and turned society on its ear with her personality. She questioned the preconditioned male society around her to create a world only she could ultimately live in (true to the subtitle of this book). Meade provides Dorothy's story with a writing style that compliments Dorothy in many ways. Meade captures Dorothy's sense of humor, self-destructiveness, and self-hatred beautifully. In a sense, this biography parallels Dorothy's short stories and poems . . . Meade remembers Dorothy for who she was and the struggles she endured."
3,Yes no maybe,"I admit I knew very little about Dorothy Parker's life before reading this bio, and a decent amount after. But I must say I found this a very clumsily written, and apparently utterly un-edited, piece of work -- eg, just who, exactly, is Ms. Meade concerned with when writing""of the tragedies that would be recognized by twentieth century women as peculiarly their own: the gut-searing loneliness of the women who have 'careers,' the women who don't marry, the women who do but divorce; the women deprived of maternal warmth and comfort who are condemned to seek love forever in the barren soil of husbands and children and even animals; women howling primitively for nourishment, flanked on one side by rejecting mothers and on the other by rejecting lovers.""Ah, the primitive howlings for barren animal love. Dorothy, we hardly knew ye."
5,Wow... what a b*(#h,I am nearly finished with this book - I haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever! I would certainly recommend it.
3,Everything you Care to Know and Too Much More!,"An extremely enjoyable account of a rather sad Life but a trifle too long for what it is worth.( Dare I suggest her "" talent ""was comparatively ""limited"" ) Though I must confess I enjoyed it very much which makes me wonder what I am ""worth""!"
1,Excruitiatingly Repetitious,"I had heard Dorothy Parker was a creative wit, but I found this bio to be about 200 pages too long, with little evidence of her writing. As Dorothy would say, ""What Fresh Hell is This?!"" As for Dorothy - didn't see much in the way of her 'talent', but as a person, she was a very negative, mean-spirited, self-absorbed, promiscuous drunk who sponged off anyone she could her entire life. What a pathetic existance. And poor Alan Campbell who was her devoted husband. It's a wonder all her excesses didn't do her in before her 77 years. I have 150 MORE pages to slug through. I will finish it but prefer to read about people who make positive contributions to humanity, not suck dry what they can from others."
3,She's got the producers but not the voice,"She used to be the backing singer of Bros. Shirley has quite some interesting producers and mixers on this CD, but not really an extraordinary voice. The songs are nice and catchy but not a real hit."
4,Don't overlook this one,"For those fans of Soundgarden and of Grunge, particularly early Grunge -- It's tempting to believe that Soundgarden's commercial success started with Badmotorfinger, so previous CD's are only for wild acid rock aficionados. But this CD is an exception. It preceded Badmotorfinger but has sufficient great cuts to make it worth pursuing. See #1, #2, #5, #7, #10, #11."
3,Full On Power Trip,"This album isn't Soundgarden's best by any means. However, there aren't many bands that ever achieve the level of excellence that soundgarden did, so this is three stars in soundgarden standards. In other words it's damn good!I feel it better to approach this album as an indicator as to how soundgarden developed. Some songs on here (such as the title track and Big Dumb Sex) hint at the way that soundgarden would develop.For anyone new to the band, I'd say get either Down On The Upside, or Superunknown first, as they're the most accessible. If you like those a lot then delve a little further back and get the rest of the albums. They're all worth it.So in conclusion, its' great by anyone else's standards, and just average by Soundgardens."
2,garden of mediocraty,"ok so I know that sounds harsh for a review title, but it was their first album and heavily influenced by their Seattle band mates Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains. They really evolved over the course of their career. if you are accustomed to the sound of Super Unknown then buy Bad Motor Finger and Down on the Upside. However if you like this album buy Ultramega ok."
5,Great.,Man this album rules. It's so varied and violent. You can tell they put their soles into this one. And - the last track Full On (reprise) is really cool too.
2,Not great but promising,"In my humble opinion, this cd is good but not great. If you like new rock, you should like it. I stick with older stuff like Led Zep or Deep Purple, they have stood the test of time. If you want to discover the band, you should go with ""Badmotorfinger"" or ""Superunknown"", that would be a better choice I believe."
2,Has about 3 songs I like bad production on it,"Well, I like the first track, loder than love and get on the snkae but this cd is held back by poor production and Cornell's vocals are losy on this cd. It's a shame because it could have been a really excellent cd but poor production holds it back. Thhe next three cd's, however, would be well produced and put soundgarden on the map."
4,Core (STP) ripped this off...... Who agrees?????,"ok.. i know i dont own either the soundgarden louder than love cd, or the stone temple pilot's core (though its coming in the mail), but i can hear a strong similarity in the two, and i know that soundgarden deffinatly had lounder than love out first.. ive only heard 30 second clips from the first 5 songs on both these cd's, so i wanna hear what the people that know what their talking about say.. im sure this cd deserves better than a four but i dont know what it should get so thats what i put.thanks a lot,stouffer"
2,Don't even bother,"this album is not that great. if you want a true soundgarden album, buy badmotorfinger and superunknown. that's all you'll ever need."
4,Louder than Led Zeppelin meets Black Sabbath,"This is the album Robert Plant and Jimmy Page wish they could still do. And for good measure, Tony Iommi would've welcomed Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell with open arms to join Black Sabbath. Can you say ""real roots heavy metal,"" boys and girls? Because that's exactly what you get on Soundgarden's epic LOUDER THAN LOVE album. Raw, explosive, powerful, hard charging, face smacking grunge metal.Chris Cornell packs one hell of an emotionally-charged, dynamic-laden vocal delivery throughout this album. Guitarist Kim Thayil's big and bad, meaty riffs and power chords give this stuff a rough and wild edge that the latter years Soundgarden would get away from. The doom and gloom rhythm section of drummer Matt Cameron and bassist Hiro Yamamoto were the perfect accompaniment to the big sounds found all over LOUDER THAN LOVE."
3,Basic water stuff,"This is a well-written pamphlet providing elementary information on water and aquarium chemistry. If that is what you are looking for, this book should probably be a 5* book. I was looking for more detailed and more in-depth information than this book provides and was a bit disappointed."
1,Ambi-conned out of $100,"Yes, they are uncomfortable, but if they worked I could overlook that. They don't. Besides the difficult installation on Vista (no instructions, figure it out yourself), once they are installed they randomly lose the connection, and even when they are working, the sound is staccatto and jumpy. When I'm playing my FP shooter game online, the connection will just terminate randomly. Worse, on Vista, this freezes the display and I can only get it back by <CTL><ALT><DEL> for the logoff menu. These went in the trash one week after I bought them. I wish I could give this product negative stars."
2,Broke after 3 days :^(,"Works as advertised, except... One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day. No particular stress applied or anything. I'm going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement.That was my only complaint. Otherwise, it's fine. Then again, breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint."
4,Works good but hard to fit 5 bike on,"This is a good bike rack and we use it often. When it is just 2 of us biking the rack works great, easy to get the bikes on and off, easy to secure the bikes, but when trying to fit 5 bikes on the rack it is difficult to make them all fit. Either the petals are hitting or the handlebars are hitting, we only managed to get 4 bikes on the rack and hauled the other one on top of our truck. Thankfully we usually go with 4 or 2 bikes when we go and it works great for that."
4,It is fine,This seems to do everything that it needs to do. I agree with other reviewers that Allen could put in a better bolt to attache it to the hitch--the current one requires two wrenches. Inconvenient but not fatal.
4,WE HOPE THIS WORKS WELL,WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE THIS YET BUT WE HOPE IT WILL WORK SO WE CAN TRANSPORT OUR BIKES.
2,Solomon's book makes organic chemistry seem overly complex.,"Solomon's book uses the wrong approach for teaching organic chemistry. Unfortunately, it has become the standard text used at most colleges -- but most people I know who used it as undergrads had to re-learn chemistry as grad students. This is because Solomon's book presents organic chemistry as a formidable science of many, many different reactions. It is difficult for beginning students to understand how these reactions are related, and so reactions involving more complex molecules look very confusing. A better introductory text is written by Seyhan Ege. There is a simplicity to organic chemistry that Solomon's text just does not demonstrate."
5,A must see for all Orwell fans,"A stumbled on the VHS version years ago and loved it. I read Keep the Aspidistra Flying, long ago. The movie is mostly true to the book. Still fresh in my mind from many years ago was Ms. Bonham Carter's retort ""I expect I shall."""
2,The Vision of Emma Blau,"This was a very disappointing book after reading ""Stones from the River"". Characterizations were weakly followed through. People would come and go with no depth to them. Story line was weak also. Kept reading to the end hoping it would get better. Would not recommend."
4,"A sort of immigrant ""Buddenbrooks""","I really enjoyed reading this book, merely for the rich language, and was reminded once again of the tremendous command of English that some foreign born authors have managed to put together. Also, the narrative is compelling and the conflicts the author sets up are truly believable and interesting. I think what's troubling about this book is that we're expecting an ""immigrant success story"" like we're used to reading and that's not what Hegi gives us--instead we have sort of more of the ""good family in decline"" motif of Thomas Mann's _Buddenbrooks_. I was also gratified that some loose ends from _Stones in the River_ were picked up, although I would agree with other reviewers that this book isn't as thrilling. I suspect that may have to do with the period and location it covers--the perception of WWII by Americans in the US is probably inherently less exciting than WWII experiences within Germany. Worth reading."
3,so-so,"i loved Stones From the River. Compared to that, this book is a disappointment. The characters did not move me at all, although the story itself wasn't too bad. I would not read it again, and only finished it b/c I like to finish what I start."
4,Thought-provoking companion book,"After enjoying Stones From The River, I was delighted to find that Ursula Hegi had written another book. She has a gift for character development that allows us to understand motives and actions from a human, rather than an ethnic, perspective. I was particularly touched by the son, Robert, who seemed to fully understand his dysfunctional marriage and eating habits and yet was unable to alter them. This book is an insight into family dynamics and the added immigration effect that is worth reading."
3,The Vision of Emma Blau,"While I did enjoy this book, I felt it was much more powerful in the beginning and began to lose steam about 1/2 way through.Hegi started to weave a colorful tapestry of characters but then abruptly stopped developing them, characters were introduced and then barely written about.It almost felt like she left the door open for a sequel because so many characters were left ""dangling."" Instead of being a GREAT book, it was merely a pleasant read."
4,wonderful trip,"I just finished reading this book today and I loved it, although I don't think it had the powerful language and images that I found in ""Stones from a River"". The book reminded me a lot of a John Irving novel, maybe because of the location in New Hampshire. Although the book did not finish as strongly as begun, it was an enjoyable read. I recommend it!"
3,"EAGERLY AWAITED, BUT DISAPPOINTING","I almost gave this book 4 stars, just for the style in writing alone. If the author had not dropped the ending into a depressing mess, I would have rated it higher. This story is well written and the subject is interesting, but I'm afraid that I was really geared for a happy ending. This is not the book to read on a dreary winter day if you are already depressed and need your spirits uplifted. It's also not a quick read mostly because the beauty of the writing and scope of the story requires some thought. I liked the book up until the last two chapters. I just did not like the ending because it seemed that Emma lost everything she had worked for. A very sad book."
4,the Vision of Emma Blau,"I loved this book. I have been telling everyone I know (mostly women) to read it. I loved the way she brought her characters to life and made you wonder what would happen to them next.I was entranced by Stones from the River, I had never read anything by Hegi before, and when I came accross this newest novel grabbed it up, knowing, in advance, I was in for a treat."
2,Too long and too dry.,"It took me a long time to get through this book. I bought it because it really sounded like it had promise, but the story just goes on and on and there is too little drama, too little of everything. Stefan Blau is a German immigrant to America at the age of 13. With savings from various waiter jobs and such, he manages to build a hotel (The Wasserburg) and turn it into an elaborate apartment building. He has a vision of a young girl that eventually turns out to be his granddaughter Emma, who will come to love and care for the Wasserburg and preserve it's heritage forever. But it doesn't work because that's all there is. The characters are lively enough and the story is well-written, but it's arid, with little substance. It felt very long to me and I picked it up to read off and on at random only when I was very bored. It started out as a nice idea, but I think Ursula Hegi should have added some excitement or mystery."
2,The Vision Of Emma Blau - audio CD version,"Alas, if you want to hear a book in audio - and if it is because you have limited vision then beware!. You may not be able to read the word ABRIDGED on the packet. When I finished this whirl wind account of an immigrant family covering several generations I was winded. I was confused about names and how they were related. It occurred to me when I finished why I felt so cheated. It lies in abridgment. A dirty trick to cut down on verbiage and package easier but shortchanging the listening audience greatly. It says abridged with author's agreement but...do they realize how much is lost - the seemingly unimportant parts that are cut ARE important or the author would not have written them. A good book can change not only to a mediocre one but one that is maddeningly inept."
5,Incredible group!,"This marvelous group from Samoa (5 brothers) mix calypso, disco/hip-hop, and harmony so beautifully. I love this CD and went to their concert last night. Such beautiful music, and no one could stay in their seat! The Katinas have songs which inspire you to worship God, mixed with very touching ones about their mother (who passed away when they were young), with other songs that you just can't resist getting up and dancing to."
5,An Incredible Project,"The Katina Brothers are a first class guy group. The highlights of this cd are One More Time, The Other Side and Take Me Higher. But the true gem and modern classic on the CD is YOU ARE GOD. This songf will remian a Christian standard for years to come. It is worth buying the entire cd for this one powerful worship song. This is a MUST HAVE cd for anyone with a taste for quality Christian music."
4,"Very good cd, but needs a little more to become perfect",This is a very good cd and if you like R&B you will like this very good. Good christian lyrics and music.
4,"Nothing Fancy, But Gets The Job Done","This product has not given me any grief since I've had it. The lights do not shine bright enough to be distracting or draw your attention. A must have for anyone with multiple gaming platforms that need to connect easily to just one TV.The only issue I've come across is with the S-Video port when I've tried to use my TV as a computer monitor. I have not figured out how to go about this yet and I doubt the problem is with this product. My computer or my graphics software is much more likely... but I just wanted to mention it, just in case."
2,Does not work well with PC output,"I needed a switch to select between my dish receiver and my PC outputs for sound. The dish receiver works fine with this unit but with the PC signal, much noise is introduced. I tried a very expensive shielded cable, a very expensive sound card, and finally, another computer all with the same result. All by itself, running through this thing, there is a significant and annoying hum added to your signal.So, if you are running with a PC, look for something else. Otherwise, I'm sure that this thing will be quite adequate for other AV equipment."
1,Big Disappointment!,"I was tired of switching my RCA cables from my TiVo, DVD and Game Cube around, so I read a lot of reviews for A/V switches. Unfortunately, this switch was worthless. It only gave me video on the first input. Every other input gave me a blue (no signal) screen.I returned it for a refund."
4,It works,"It works and satisfied what we needed. At first I had the impression that it had two conventional RCA/S video outputs, but one is only for headphones. It worked for us because we wanted an additional headphone output, but for those thinking they would have two full sets of audio and video outputs, they will be dissapointed."
4,unrisky buisness,"Most of the tracks on this cd are good. The only two that were not as good as the rest , were ""Guido the Killer Pimp"" and ""After the Fall"", though these were still pretty good. Most of the Tangerine Dream ones are hypnotic and dream like. Definately worth the purchase. I recently bought the film on blue ray so this is a good complement."
3,Right on target!!,"It's fun, it's sexy, and it's right on target! Tom Cruz ""cruzes"" his way through an Academy Award-winning performance in the movie, while the soundtrack to ""Risky Business"" simply blows your mind!!The classic songs are all here, to lend a hand to the classic movie: Phil Collins' ""In the Air""; Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll""; (remember the hilarious portion of the movie when Tom Cruz is caught dancing around in his underwear? I was laughing for days!!)Nonetheless, this soundtrack captures both the hilarious AND the mystic vibe that the movie portrayed, like the sizzling scene in the subway between Cruz and Rebecca D. (Ooh la la!!)Well, excuse my rambling, but this masterpiece soundtrack of the 80s is simply too good to pass up. Get it and relive those days when you too could've got into an Ivy League school, yet squandered it all away for one night of partying and a gorgeous hooker...JUST TAKE THOSE OLD RECORDS OFF THE SHELF!!............."
3,Okay,"The best track on here is Muddy Waters' ""I'm A Man"". Otherwise, the Tangerine Dream music is just okay. This is a hard soundtrack to find; I had a hard time finding it when the movie was first released!"
3,Wonderful fragrance,"This is the most pure, beautiful fragrance we've come across in a very long time. It's wonderful and can be worn all the time, for day or evening. We found that it doesn't last very long, however, and needs to be freshened up several times a day."
2,It's Ok,"I did not get the sound I was looking for! they were very plastic speakers but they were ok! If you are looking for something good, you should find something else"
2,sound,didnt get the sound i would like out of them. for the same price i found something tht was better
5,Great book on the power of Mindfulness,This book is wonderful! Great for women trying to return to mindfulness. And a wonderful introduction to the healing powers of food and sound
1,Disappointed,"The book was in black and white, illustrations were OK, not great and hard to follow. Not the best book to start off with if you are new to Temari."
4,For those who love Tim.,"This is a pretty basic greatest hits from Tim Curry's (I don't want to say ""solo,"" but if you're looking for Rocky Horror, it's not on this album) musical career in the late '70's. Mr. Curry is as underrated a singer as he is an actor, so if you're already a big fan, you won't mind paying the price for this CD (upward of $70...it's so expensive because it's been out of print for quite some time),and it is worth it in my opinion, but for the price, it's really only for those who love Tim. And I do."
2,I'm at a loss for words in how to evaluate this,"I...........dont........... know............. how.......... to......... approach........ this.Tim Curry is certainly a capable singer since he comes from a stage background and is the voice on Rocky Horror. But it also seems a bit coincidental when this came out...maybe related to the fame of Rocky Horror and notoriety of Curry's career. In the world of celebs doing music, maybe I would place him higher than Don Johnson and Bruce Willis but lower than Juliette Lewis and Will Smith? The best song is "" I do the rock"" but it's awfully Roxy Music-ish!!!I guess if you are enamored and thunderstruck by Rocky Horror then you will find legitimacy with this ""best of"" compilation."
4,True Melodrama,"Its all true in this Universal film that Sirk raises to a loftier level.Hudson, Stack and Maloney also teamed up in the drama "" The Tarnished Angels"" made at about the same time In ""Written on the Wind"" we see character actors of the period...Robert Keith, Brian,s father, Edward Platt and Robert Wilke( bartender)The title song was also a big hit at the time.Stack would soon turn to Televison and become Eliot Ness.( Untouchables)"
3,A soap opera on the big screen,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This movie was groundbreaking in several ways. It can be descibed best as a soap opera.It is the story of a family and their relationship with friend of one of the family members. A man falls in love with the sister of his best friend. Later both of them fall in love with a different woman who they fight over. She later marries one of them but when she becomes pregnant, the husband, believing himself to be sterile, accuses his friend of being the father.The film deals with subjects rarely (if ever) mentioned in movies of the time and sparked controversey as a result.The DVD has theatrical trailers for both this film and the film ""All That Heaven Allows"" which was also directed by Douglas Sirk and released by Criterion as well. There is also a huge presentation and slideshow of many of Douglas Sirk's other films."
3,Poor Packaging for the Price,"Excellent content as one would expect from Joe Marshall; however, for the cost the packaging is pretty cheap - cardboard case with oversized folding cardboard inserts - with a thin, loose paper (non-laminated) outline of the content. A small written booklet, and plastic cd case as per DVD's would be better. The $60 list price is way too high .. thank goodness for the AMAZON discount."
3,I agree with Andrew,"Excellent Content, horrible packaging. I bought this to expand my own Native library as well as a history resource for my teenage son.Even if it was packaged like the standard boxed set for album catalogues, I could deal with that. It could be stored with my other media. C'mon, for that price and the fact that this is reference and not ""just a book on CD,"" it should have been packaged nicer."
1,As Bad As It Gets !,"The RCA DRC8005N is every bit as bad as all the reviews say it is. It is enough to make me stay away from anything RCA. I grew up watching the great RCA color TVs. I used to work at a repair shop many years ago. RCAs were well built. Those days like many others are gone. Today, I see that apparently you can't delete a title unless you have the DVD. The worst ever!!"
1,Fourth time and it still doesn't work,"I am on my fourth (3rd directly from the factory) replacement.1st time - would not record or respond - bad DVD assembly2nd time - no sound via HDMI3rd time - HDMI worked for approx 3 hrs and then nothing4th time - back to RCA for another unit.So far, I haven't had one that worked and I have been trying to get a working unit for the last 6 months.Quality or engineering design is severly compromised with this piece of electronics.Local service vendor is GREAT, but so far, this whole experience is something all should avoid."
1,Makes a better doorstop...,"I had troubles with this item from the start. I didn't get a successful DVD recording out of thing before it decided that it wouldn't eject (not even a paper clip would make it let go!). Luckily, it was a DVD+RW and not one of our bought DVDs. I've only had this item for about 3 weeks and had nothing but trouble.Its remote is counter-intuitive, going against some of the standard button presses on most DVD/VCR remotes (i.e. after hitting pause, to continue recording, you must hit record, to continue playing you must hit play, hitting pause again will not work!)Please do not buy this, save your money, a rubber doorstop will get less in the way and can be picked up for less than $5!- Davey"
1,Life Span: 14 Months,"This is a report on the RCA DRC 8000N, an immediate predecessor of the unit described for sale. My 8000N was bought in December 2003 and has suffered what is described to be a mainboard faiure in the last week of February, 2005:two and half months after the warranty expires. Apparently it will cost more to repair than it is worth. Despite the other criticisms of the product, I used it only in conjunction with a TIVO for archiving-it worked well."
1,Look anywhere else first!,"This recorder (8005n) was great for about 3 weeks then everything went bad. The drive inside the unit is a Ricoh and the firmware on it unique to RCA, this means that any other drive that you may want to use to replace the Ricoh one with will not work. When the drive went bad the price to replace it was over three hundred dollars. The drive would no longer track on any dvd placed in the unit. The new 8060n no longer uses the same drive so this may warrant a new look at the RCA line of DVD recorders."
2,Does not work as described,"Want to hook up two side by side HD TVs to xbox and only use one or the other to view xbox at any given time. It only work when one TV is connected. I gave it two stars instead of one only because it does work as an HDMI extension which helps, but does not work with both HDMI outputs connected at the same time. I think I need to spend more and get a powered splitter. Once again, you get what you pay for, I should of believed the other reviews, my bad."
1,Bad item,"Worked for a day or so then quit completely, not worth the money, very disappointed. Would not recommend that any one buy this."
1,Terrible,Pros:noneCons:Doesn't work correctly and if it does the image is grainyBad image qualityWon't work with two outputs at a time
2,Blah,It's ok if you don't need to transmit the video more than 3 feet. It will only work on one side at a time also. Very cheap though.
1,It appears to work as advertised for 720p but not 1080p.,"I could not get the splitter to work except for grainy green lines on one projector in 1080p. On a whim, I decided to try it on lower resolution settting (720p) and it worked ok. Unfortunately, I don't want 720p, I want 1080p. I didn't but 1080p-capable hardware to run only 720p. The advertisement says ""supports extra high resolution,"" which I think it highly deceptive. Even though it is not a specific claim to support 1080p, the add should say what actual resolutions the splitter does support."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this hoping it would work as to split off of my directv box so could run an hdmi cable to another tv. It worked when I first plugged it in. I was very happy, then the next time I turned on my Directv box without ever disconnecting this, the sound didn't work on either tv. I disconnected it and reconnected back and it worked, then same thing time and time again. For the money it works as long as you reconnect it and only want to hear out of one tv."
1,Not A Good Product,"I purchased 4 of these splitters to be used in a display area of our store. These splitters were plugged into a HDMI amp that supported 8 TVs. Because we had 9 TVs in that area I used the splitter to support two TVs. The cables on these TVs were 6 and 8 foot in length and both cables worked when plugged into the AMP and both TVs had a sharp picture. On the first splitter I tried the casing came off of the splitter when I attempted to plug it into the jack on the AMP. Tried the second splitter, no problem with connecting it to the AMP but it wouldn't carry a signal to either TV. Tried the remaining 2 splitters with the same result, either no signal or a very weak signal. These were just garbage."
1,1 to 1 splitter,This splitter only worked when one HDMI cable was plugged in...completely defeating it's purpose. Big disappointment. I guess that's what's expected for $7.
1,Doesn't work. Don't buy.,"It seems simple enough, split the signal for two monitors, but it didn't work at all. No signal out of either plug. Don't buy."
1,Does not work for 2 different video sources,"Item does not work when trying to get one receiver to go to two different video sources. DVD plugged into a TV and a Projector does not allow the proper transfer of the data and you do not get a picture. Unplug one of the items and the connection seems to work OK, but this is not what the cable is supposed to do...?"
1,Don't Buy This Splitter it does not work,I agree exactly with the other buyer. When I plug 2 hdmi cables in I get nothing. This does not split the signal into two as advertised.I am not sure what it does. I think the only thing it split is you from your money.
1,HDMI Splitter,"I was surprised amazon even bothered marketing this product. This was a waste of money and a complete piece of junk, Picture distorted and no audio."
1,HDMI passive splitter can not work,"This product has limited application. This is because HDMI is a bidirectional peer to peer interface. In other words when you connect an HDMI source with an HDMI display these devices ""talk to each other"" and this communication is required for the devices to recognize each other. If you connect 2 display devices to one source the communication can not take place and the results are most commonly no signal or very poor quality. In addition, an HDMI source will most likely not be able to drive an extended multi-cable network.If you want to connect 2 displays to one HDMI source you will need an amplified HDMI splitter with a price range starting at $20 and up to $200."
2,Not adequate,"Since my HDTV has only one HDMI outlet, I tries using a=the splitter, but it degraded the picture quality too muh,"
1,The 'new technology' has created a new problem. You can't split the signal so easily.,"I was certain I could get one of these splitters to work (I like to watch tv in my living room, and when I go into the kitchen, keep watching the same show.The deal (from a non-techie) is the new digital process created a two link between the source and the TV (I think to assure proper sync of sound and HD signal vs what the TV can handle.Along with that new tech - comes the impossibility to have the signal split since the source (DVR or whatever) can only communicate with one TV as sound and HD switches back and forth.DON'T GET THIS OR ONE LIKE IT. It's not like the old days of just splitting the signal without much effort."
2,HDMI splittler - PTC,"This HDMI splitter [PTC] has good construction and is fine for ""quick and dirty"" generation of two HDMI streams, but it generates too much noise for quality image display/transfer/rendering. Need the amplified versions for high quality. [Kurt Robinson]"
1,Poor signal after splitting,"This splitter reduced my signal quality to where I was getting bright green spots all over the image after it was attached. I though it may be due to my source signal quality, so I hooked it up to my friend's Direct TV box and we experienced the same thing. It's useless. I just completely wasted my money. I hate that feeling."
3,Digital Cable/DVD connection,"Splitting the digital cable HDMI port to two powerd on TVs resulted in an ""HDMI intrusion"" error from the box. The error remained in the foreground covering most of the screen but there was a good picture behind the error screen on both TVs. Splitting the HDMI connection from the DVD player to two powered on TVs resulted in a good display on one TV and poor display on the other (Wavey Lines). The splitter would work well for using only one display powered on at a time."
2,Poor product performance,"I rounded my 1 and a 1/2 star assessment up to two stars based on the fact that it has the parts to connect two 1080i or 1080p tv sets with HDMI cables to a hi-def satellite receiver that just has a single HDMI port. In practice, though, I found that the two hi-def tv sets couldn't play both HDMI-quality sound and picture simultaneously. It just didn't work. Also, HDMI cables didn't fit snugly into the splitter."
1,Doesn't Work,"Signal strength was so diminished that my 1080p Sharp Aquos would not recognize it. I was expecting to be able to take the HDMI out on my cable box and split it, sending one signal directly to the TV and the other signal to my receiver. That way I could choose between watching TV with the sound through the TV or through the room speakers. The Tiger Splitter doesn't work for this application."
1,Waste of money!!!,"Video is terrible, tons of static. Video signal is about equal to S-video with a loose wire. Audio crackles and pops horrible distortion. I had this splitter going from my ps3 to my samsung 40 lcd and my panosonic projector. Even with only one receiver on at a time the signal is still horrible. It is so horrible I thought it might damage my screen or projector and took it off. You get what you pay for, if you need to split your HDMI signal you are going to have to buy a powered splitter. I promise you if you care anything about your video quality, you will not be happy with this product."
1,hdmi splitter,Do not buy this splitter! I tried to split the signal from my cable box to living and dining room but it did not work. I think the splitter weakens the signal. Don't buy it waste of money....StarTech.com HDMISPL1HH 1 feet HDMI to 2x HDMI Splitter Cable for Digital Video - M/F
1,each port works independently but not at the same time,"I have connected this splitter to my HP PC with VGA, DVI and HDMI output port to my 25"" monitor and to Samsun HD TV. Both ports on the splitter seem to work independently but not at the same time. If I plug in cables to both ports on the splitter at the same time neither my PC monitor nor my Samsung HD TV works. Do not buy this; donate the money to charity instead. Any amount of time and money wasted is my time and my money wasted."
1,horrible,it sucked i tried it on 2 differenmt tvs and it didnt work i emailed the company not to get a responce was so upset
2,No sound on 2nd TV,Need to return these as they are unable transmit audio and video to two different TV's. . . Very disapointing
1,lasted 1 month,i installed this on my security system and in 1 month it quit working the 1 st one didnt work at all
1,Absolutely useless,I can't believe the signal attenuation going through this piece of garbage. With this device connected to the tv and the blue ray player and Xbox connected to it the screen output was worse that anything I ever expected. A complete waste of 7bucks. Lesson learned. Next time I read the reviewes before I purchase. Would sure like a refund!!!
1,DID NOT LIKE IT!,"Just did not work between my 46"" LG HD TV and my 51"" Samsung HD TV. Do not buy this Item."
1,It Didn't Do What I Wanted!,"I was hoping to run two TVs off my DirecTV box with this HDMI splitter. It won't. If it did, I would have been very happy."
1,such a dissapointment,i recieved 3 of these items and not one of them worked correctly if i turned one tv on the other lost signal so it was more like a switcher than a splitter i had to buy powered splitters for them to work this is a cheap splitter which will not boost the power there is no use for this other than a switcher
1,SPlitter does NOT work with Verizon,"I have Verizon FIOS (HD without recorder/DVR) and the splitter did NOT work as needed. It would work intermittently when ONLY one output was connected, but NOT with both connected at the same time, and NOT at all when both outputs were turned on. I threw the splitter in the trash."
1,Does not work,It split my signal in 2 but no audio on either tv. I'm bummedHoping to get a refund for this product. From what I have seen not a lot of people have had luck with this splitter
1,"Worked for a month, then ....","After a month, it developed the same problem as most people complain about... Only one HD TV would work at a time (either one but not both 1080 sets at the same time). Also it was very tricky to get it to work the first time, having to plug in and power up the outputs and input in just the right sequence. When it finally failed though, no sequence of connecting and powering up would make it work right. Piece of junk! I wish I had bothered to read the comments before I bought it."
1,not worth getting,"This product doesnt work. It will work if you have only 1 tv hooked to it, but you lose picture if you hook a second tv to it. Kinda defeats the purpose!!!!!-"
1,Junk... Do not buy,Do research before buying. You will need a powered splitter of any sort to send one output signal to two screens. This thing does nothing.
1,Premium Splitter,"I bought two of these splitters. There is nothing premium about them. Hooked them up and got a signal from it for a day.After that, useless. I wondered if it might be the weight of the HDMI cable hanging on it. Swapped out with the other splitterand there still was no signal. Don't waste your time or money with these. I ended up buying a splitter box and have no problemsother than it is bright!"
1,NEEDS AMPLIFICATION,"There are a lot of technicals involved in understanding this, wikipedia's HDTV page explains it fairly well, but the short story is your output probably isn't strong enough to be split; this requires an amplified splitter...little pricier."
1,horrible,I tried to split an HD signal to two LCD's. Did not work I should have read these reviews and I would not have bought this item. Total waste of money.
1,No Audio Split,This cable will work marginally well to split video but if you want sound with that video forget about this product.
1,would never buy again,"the quality of picture with only one cable plugged in was just fine, but as soon as i plug the 2nd hdmi cable in, the picture on both tv's goes very fuzzy/grainy....dont buy this.....spend the money for a good electronic splitter that can boost signal"
2,Works not well,"Was trying to split my hi Def cable signal to two items and both went from crystal clear to fuzzy, with lines. It worked but not well. Spend the money and buy a more expensive item that should work right."
2,Poor quality and limited use.,I ordered this in hopes of splitting my monitor with my computer and Xbox. When both HDMI were plugged in the connection was severed and nothing displayed on the TV. I rated it 2 stars because you can use it as an extender and not much else.Positives- Gives another foot to a hdmi cable.Negatives- If two cables are plugged in than nothing will show on the screen- No real function to this item
2,HDMI Splitter,"Not sure that this one is fully working, have hooked it up to my tv and tried to run a laptop through the connection, did not work, only way to get picture was direct cord, no configuration with this splitter worked"
2,HDMI splitter,I attempted to use the splitter to interface two HDMI outputs (ATT u-verse 'box' and DVD player) to a single HDMI input on my HD TV. I always turned OFF the device not in use but the splitter did not discriminate; it only worked if I disconnected one of the devices from the HDMI output jack. Ended up using the traditional HD cable package for the Uverse input
1,Forgot to explain problems with device,"I hooked this up to Hopper and then to the two TV's in same room.It turned one screen black and then screen would go on and off.Doesn't seem to work, allowing both TV's on at same time.I ordered a power unit for splitting HDMI signal."
1,Displays Video but No Sound,"This splitter blocks out the audio. It is nice to get cheap electronics but unfortunately sometime we get what we pay for. This is the case here. This experience did make me realize one thing. With amazon, you usually pay to ship and always pay to return if there is a problem. You waste $10, $15 or more and have nothing to show. The junk dealer is out nothing. I looked for this product on ebay. I found it...comparable description, exact appearance, free shipping and lower price. At least that way, if it does not work, throw it away. You skip the aggravation and are only out the price of the junk. Wonder how long this will stay posted!"
1,didnt work,this product did not work for me...it was returned and promptly credited back to me...bought different splitter that works just fine
1,Did not work for what I wanted it for,This device might work for some people depending on what they wanted to use if for but it did not work for me. I wanted to give my wide screen TV an extra HDMI port (it only has one) so I plugged this device in the TV's only HDMI port thinking it would serve as a HDMI splitter so I could run both my DVR receiver and my Blu Ray player into the TV but it did not work. I did not return it because I figured it was not quite worth my trouble and time to get an RMA and drive 10 miles to a UPS or Fedex dropoff facility. I guess you win some and you lose some and this is one I lost.
1,Horrible. Does Not Work,"I thought I would take a small gamble with this relatively inexpensive item. I lost. It truly is not capable of splitting any signal. I know nothing about the engineering, but I think it's probably a power issue. If either output is plugged in by itself, the system works fine, but once the other hdmi output is utilized, both displays go dark.Oh, well, on to a powered unit."
1,I am disappointed. The splitter does not split. Only one side of the splitter is live.,Disappointing. Only one side works.does not live up to its description. Would not buy another.HDMI Splitter (1 to 2) Premium Splitter Cable
1,HDMI splitter,"The product did not work for me. When I attached it, I got very poor reception. Not happy with it at all."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought 2 of these splitters just to be able to have 2 TV's off a DVD player. 1 splitter did not work and the other screwed up the picture so bad you couldn't tell what you were watching.
1,Don't Buy,I agree with most other reviews. This product does not work and I should have listen to the advice. Plugged unit in and at first got picture no sound. Turned second LCD on and both units then failed to get a picture or sound. Worthless.
1,Don't waste your money!,This was a huge waste of money. The video image on both outputs was unwatchable. Don't buy this unless you just want to throw your money away.
1,Doesn't work w/ PS3,Does not work on the PS3. I opened the cable up and found it fill with thick rubber and white hard plastic with no wirings inside...it's basically empty.
3,Works But...,"While the splitter does allow one to send the HiDef signal to 2 HD receivers, both must be tuned to the same source. Not exactly what I had in mind."
1,couldn't get it to work well,Be careful of this product. It drops the signal too much for my Samsung to recognize the signal and for the couterpart Sharp to recognize either.
1,*** Worthless - Do not buy ***,"I tried to use this to split a signal from my Scientific Atlanta DVR from Cox cable so I could have a tv in the living room and another on my patio. Once plugged in the output of the DVR, the splitter would only push signal to one TV or the other. As soon as you plug in the second HDMI cable, both screens go blank. What's the point of that???I sucked it up and bought a $63.99 (with shipping) powered splitter from firefold.com and it works fine ( [...] )Long story short, don't waste you money on this item.JH"
1,HP splitter,"This does not work from a Directv Box. Either both pictures work without sound, or there is a fuzzy blur on the bottom of the screen."
1,Splitter wont split,The splitter makes claims that you can split one HDMI out to two devices. Well not so much. Should of read the reviews first before wasting 20 bucks on a product that is junk.
1,Does Not Work,Horrible waste of money do not buy this product. My project was too simple for this not to work right.
1,Did not work,Tried several times to make it work would not connect even to one port would not tell anyone to buy it
1,Did not work.,Item did not work for my Tv had to return it. No instructions came with package showing how it works or hooks up..
1,Terrible performance,"I saw awful video noise at 1080p, on both target displays through existing cables that had performed fine. This unit is not up to the job."
1,Useless,"I need to send one signal to my upstairs, and one to my downstairs Sony tv. Simple? Just connect via this splitter (HDMI) to the Direct tv box. WRONG! I should have believed the reviews. It either flashes or fails both tv's.Doesn't anyone build a splitter with enough capacity to carry a 1080 HD signal without all this loss???"
1,Boring Zzzzzzzzzz,The tones sound the same....and it's too long and very BORING.I sold this piece of garbage a month after I got it. Good only for falling asleep at night.
5,Jazz guitar at its finest,"Now, this is what jazz guitar is all about! 2 brilliant players get to show their craft wonderfully on this record. Before hearing this record I was already a big fan of Pat Metheny, but I had not heard Jim Hall. I will definetely look more into Jim Hall's work in the future. both these two guitarists are marvellous players.This album is a great addition to any jazz collection, especially if you like guitar. I recommend this album to anyone who is even remotely interested in jazz or guitar."
4,Beautiful disc,"I probably will end up repeating what others have said, but this is a beautiful guitar cd featuring two top-drawer players. The compositions are short and sweet and the interplay between Metheny and one of his influences is incredible."
3,Not for a lightning storm,"I plugged my power center into the wall outlet and connected my tv,etc.What confused me was in the instructions - it says ""Warning - in the event of a lightning storm, immediately disconnect your Monster PowerCenter from its power source. After you've done this, it's not necessary to disconnect any components from your Monster PowerCenter""Am I missing something? I thought the purpose of the PowerCenter was that in case of a lighting storm you could still leave everything plugged in. Maybe I misunderstood what the purpose of this PowerCenter is."
4,A little Power please,"So if you have a house with plenty of outlets and only want to protect your big TV and the cable box from a Power spike this is perfect (5 star). If you're like me though and need one outlet to service your tv, modem, xbox, 360, computer, all at the same time, this just isn't enough. The warranty only covers items directly connected so while a cheap power strip could be attached to this (which I did for a while before I bought this guys bigger 800 series brother) only the power strip would be covered. Enjoy."
4,Nice product,Product is well designed and made installation easy. Really won't know how effective it is until a lightening strike occurs.
4,Good investment,"If you have invested into a decent home theatre, then you needa to protect your investment. This surge protector seems to do a good job. The TV still works, and we have had a few power failures. In the past I would receive interference from other electrical items, but that is no longer the case"
5,Color Me gone--Gald to hear it again,"Heard these guys in the 80s, then followed Marti Jones and Don Dixon's seperate and mixed carreers. They opened in the old 9:30 club on F st NW in DC, thought they were the greatest pop band I'd heard in awhile, then ...POOF!..vanished. I have been listening to this 6 song cassette /EP over and over in the car, too bad it's not on CD.GREAT album--really glad to hear them again--Marti Jones phrasing and clear voice are exceptional, and the love song themed EP just flows!John Jacobs"
3,RIPPEROLOGY. PRESENTATION COULD BE BETTER.,"Robin Odell is an expert on his subject and the book contains much useful and interesting detailed information. However I did find the narrative difficult to follow and would have preferred the text to have been broken down into short sections each devoted, say, to one Ripper book and how it contributes to the body of literature."
1,This Sucks,Anybody who is a DJ knows that Numark sucks. I hate this product so much every time i bought this and used it on my turntables it broke. Never buy this Needle is horrible.
5,Nice replacement,A very good replacement cartridge for my Numark turntable - gives a crisp clear sound to my digital recordinds and also very easy to install. I would recommend this cartridge to audio buffs who are looking for a good price and good quality sound.
1,Not a good choice,"It distorts the mid-range maddeningly and doesn't reproduce sibilants (words starting/ending with S, Ch words, etc.) accurately."
4,Great for Florida-type weather,I play basketball three times a week -- outside in the high humidity in Florida. These shorts are the best I have found to stay cool. Plus they look great!
2,does not look good and does not feel right,does not look good and does not feel righttoo wide at the thighs
1,The guy is a fraud,"Let me mention that I personaly observed a UFO close-up - so no doubts there in general and I am usually quite generous with bending science, but this is DVD just too much: this guy knows nothing about nuclear physics and the math involved. He not only built an impossible rocket engine, he also built an unlikely targeting system. Only a black hole bends light - right (any gravity source does - but who cares)and he found a mistake in Hawkins math meeting the man in England by just having a glimps at the blackboard. I bet the timing doesnt check out (but I havn't taken the trouble to confirme that) and will anybody pls ask Mr Hawkins if he ever even heard the name Adair? That childhood genius then proceeded to live a life of a lowly technical saleman until he comes out of the closet decades later. His only protection is that the average showbizz TV person knows even less (or is afraid to ask). This is stupid even for the usual disinfo. I want my money back !!!!!"
4,The definition of useful: The New Penguin Dictionary of Business,"This compact handbook contains business information of all sorts, and is nearly as entrancing to read as a novel. We find biographical notes, financial concepts, marketing terms, historical events and even psychological theories ('cognitive dissonance,' 'the hierarchy of needs,' among others). The writers have accomplished the miraculous: brief, accurate and memorable essays on the central concepts of business in the modern age. Keep it close at hand, read it on the train, quote it-- people will think you're a genius."
4,A cut above the typical Action Yarn!,"This is a stylish film from french director Luc Besson. The leggy Anne Parillaud gives a star-making performance in the title role, she makes Nikita a complex, multi-layered character, she smoothly crosses the lines between violence and tenderness. The soundtrack is perfect and sets the tone for the uniquely crafted action-suspense sequences. Much more intelligent than the typical action movie, but it is also a fascinating character study of a unique nature; the fact that one mistake in Nikita's life can ruin her chances of having a normal life in the future and how it breaks up her love relationship is not the kind of sub-plots that you put in an action movie, yet they are necessary and well-done. Extras: spot 'Catherine' from Truffaut's 'Jules And Jim'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
1,Badly produced DVD,"I agree with the guy below about the picture quality. I liked this movie, but once I started noticing (about five minutes into it) the terrible compression, I couldn't keep my eyes off it. For those who aren't sure what that means, picture this: large chunks of the screen will freeze for a second or two. It's the only DVD I own that's done this badly. Why spend $20 to own a movie if it's going to look lousy?"
3,"Pretty decent flick, although a bit old","I have to admit, the first time I watched this movie, I was blown away, by the great acting and the captivating story. Anne Parillaud plays a perfect part. What I didn't like about this DVD was the fact that they did not optimize it whatsoever. I just recently bought a very expensive wide-screen television only to find out that if you display this DVD in it's original wide-screen setting you will get the infamous black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Also the sound isn't very clear, but then again this movie is already quite old. If you liked the Bridget Fonda version ""Assassin"" you should definately see this one, because it is way better."
2,Not my cup of tea.,I find that I am no longer turned on by a lot of violence. I think the film is more aimed at the younger crowd.
4,"Fast paced, action packed, great Anne Parrillaud","Anne Parillaud is transformed from walking dead woman junky to professional killer. Going through this she tries to find a real life (what she is utterly denied by her ""mentor"").Action is nearly everywhere. And it pleases the eye (Luc Besson is always a good photographer while he's directing a movie)."
1,It was not in English,This move was not in English. It should hand stated this and I wouldn't have bought it. Please look into this.
2,Do you speak French?,"If not then stay away from this thing. It does not translate at all. Jeez, you would think we'd at least get an accent or two considering that the setting is obviously somewhere in Europe for crying out loud?Anne Parillaud plays the killer in desperate need of a [...] enhancement. The French guy from The Patriot plays her opposite, very convincingly too if you turn off the sound. Incredibly, this movie is much better in French without the subtitles. Better than a sleeping pill. [...]"
1,Good story - Bad film making,"The story is good actually, but the presentation was horrible, segmented, broken up, has no flow at all.. What the heck is the matter with the filmmakers?? On top of that, the translation was horrible - what? made in China translator was doing it from French to English, that was bloody stupid!!! Or was it a ""translator"" from Microsoft used ha??"
4,Thrilling One,Sharp images over a a thrilling movie.I have appreciated it so much and I guess it's a worth watching one in its genre.
4,The Original is still Best,"La Femme Nikita has spawned an american film version (Point of no Return-starring Bridget Fonda) and several TV series' and media, which shows the popularity of this film's character and story about a former drug addict who kills a cop during a botched robbery and gets sentenced to the death penalty. In which a secret government agency agrees to spare her life if she agrees to undergo training to become a highly skilled black ops agent. The story line might be a bit cliched in this day and age but when it first released it was an awesome movie...and still is. This version is far superior to the american release, with better acting overall. There are twists and turns and betrayals abound. Overall a quality film."
5,Hard Hitting Action,"Anne Parillaud is outstanding in Luc Besson's stylish thriller. Nikita's metamorphosis from doper to government assassin is dark and painful. There are visceral moments in the film that keep the viewer on the edge of his/her chair. The film is in French with English subtitles. Parillaud is brilliant, engaging and above all vulnerable in this hard hitting film."
1,Five Turnips Award,"Ridiculous plot + cartoonish characters = Absolute trash and another waste of time and ressources by Luc Besson, only to prove if necessary that some french movies can be just as idiotic as the worse of Hollywood grade Z exploitation flicks."
3,Fonda Did it Better,"As much as I do not like the Fonda name, Fonda junior did this flick no shame. USA takes the day on the re-make! This one is alright if you can get past the very '80's feel and schtickie acting. Sex Pistols and Flock of Sea Gulls should have done the sound track, but they didn't."
5,My favorite Luc Besson's movie ...by far!,"Intelligent denunciation of governement activities. What's worse? Violence or ""legal"" violence. Anne Parillaud in one of her most breathtaking role. As a junky she is given a second chance in life by becoming a killer for the french government, but is it worth it? Hundred times better ( if it's not more) than its remake (Point of no return)."
4,Excellent overall,Overall I really enjoy this film. It has alot of subplots and is very exciting. The acting from everyone is amazing and the action fast and dramatic. The scenes are filmed in an excellent way.The last 20 minutes strike me as a little weak and is really the only part of the film I do not like. The sound on the dvd is poor. It is not true 5.1 and the French track while the best for emotion and ambience is the worst sound on the dvd. But still worth a buy.
5,Power and beauty in one little book,"This little book has been with me several years and its simplicity and beauty had turn it in to my favorite. What it amazes me more is that I am reading by now great books by U.S. Andersen(TMW) and R. Collier (TSOTA) and they include in detail what this little book already said. Read it, it works."
5,"All we need, distilled","If you've read Seth and Castaneda and A Course in Miracles and Choprah and Conversations with God and and and ... and you know it's all true but your head is spinning, get this little gem, read it and keep it by your bedside."
4,"Good illustrations, easy to read","(I just typed a long review and it vanished, darn it.)A good series, with good illustrations. I only have Volume 6, Dinosaur Cousins, out of the library, and I especially like the clear drawings of the dino skeletons. Each set of two facing pages has its own topic presented in bold face on the upper left, with paragraphs and wonderfully up-to-date illustrations, arguments, and open-ended questions.If you like this subject matter, you may also like _The Flying Dinosaurs_ by Philip J. Currie with illustrations by Jan Sovak."
2,Earrings,This pair of earrings were nice but the gold detailing on them was not complete so I was rather disappointed.
4,"""Attractive"" is right!","Very striking colors. Given as a Christmas gift, and she loved them. Larger than I was expecting; I thought they would be about the size of a dime, but they were more like nickles, maybe even a tiny bit larger. Still absolutely beautiful. If my sister hadn't wanted them, I would have kept them for myself!"
1,Poor quality,"These earrings would have been lovely if they had consistent quality. The gold detailing on one earring is quite heavy, but very complete, while the gold detailing on the other is extremely light and messy. Was going to give these as a gift, but not now - I've seen nicer looking things from the dollar store."
4,Elegant and unique earrings,"I was drawn to these earrings at first sight. I love the beautiful contrast of the colors and how the clasp adds to its appeal. The size is perfect and both sides have the same picture. I would've given a 3.5 because on one side of the earring, the gold appears moderately dulled/lacking in luster (gold) when compared to the other 3 sides. All in all, I give it a 4 because of it's uniqueness and it was the first time my boyfriend complimented me on them."
4,Good deal for the price,"These earrings are really pretty but bigger than what I expected, hence the 4 stars. I have received compliments whenever I have worn them and overall am very pleased with this perchase. How could you go wrong at this price?! The only other issue I have with them is that the hooks are silver yet the decoratative color around the edges of the beads are gold, not the best match, should have been silver also, but really not too important an issue."
3,lever backs are small,"I recently received these earrings. The design overall was pretty clear. However, be aware that if you have thicker earlobes (as I do), the lever-back hoop may be too small. It just fit my ears. Otherwise a nice earring for the price."
3,A bit cheap looking...,Cute earrings but cheap looking. I was somewhat embarrassed to give these as a gift.. Luckily my 4 year old gave them as a gift and grandma loved them!
3,Swarovski Elements Crystal & Cloisonne Bead Sterling Silver Drop Earrings,"Decent pair of earrings, colors blend well, and can be dressed down or up, depending on the occasion. They're a nice size, and nice comfortable clasp. I purchased these as a gift with a pair of stud earrings, and matching bangle bracelets as well, and they absolutely loved it. Overall, the earrings are probably not the best quality; nevertheless, they'll workout just fine.Made with Swarovski Elements Crystal & Cloisonne Bead Sterling Silver 1.5"" Long Drop Earrings"
4,Pamplona and Beyond,"Valerie Hemingway has written a superb memoir with sensitivity and insight into a complex man and his world. Writing about Ernest Hemingway, she strikes a difficult balance between adoration and objectivity. Her prose is pleasing--sweet in places--sometimes humorous, and altogether compelling. Valerie Hemingway's often forlorn childhood in Ireland is interesting, and the unlikely confluence of this convent girl and the macho author is fascinating. On top of that comes a romance with Brendan Behan, Ernest Hemingways's suicide, and Valerie's eventual marriage to Hemingway's son, Gregory, who turns out to be a transvestite. Valerie Hemingway spent 28 years involved with the Hemingway family, and her observations and comments are important additions to the lore about Ernest Hemingway, his friends, enemies, wives and children. ""Running With the Bulls"" is not happy reading in many spots, but it is always engaging."
3,Truth does not Suffer,A balanced and sympathetic description of events from someone who was really there but whose ego does not lead to embellishment of the facts.
3,"with papa in spain,1959 ..and another story.","If you are interested in Hemingways last year and some of what went on in Spain circa 1959 and the bullfights there and miss danby- smiths`recollections, this book is for you. It is for the most part well written and you always want to know what happens next.But the real story of the book is that of Hemingways son,Gregory,(who wrote one of the best books on his father) ...the above rating mainly because there should have been more real insight into the writer than is described in this portrait."
3,Only a beginning,"A very disturbing book and a strange story but I could not stop reading till I finished. Yet, finally, very disappointing because there is so much left out -- as if too much has not been said. Valerie Hemingway -- whose own story and autobiography seems so very interesting -- never fills in those spaces that explain how she really came to be where she was in the years she describes (both before meeting Hemingway, with Hemingway and her life with his family after his death). It's a great outline for a great book. Hope she writes it someday."
5,Loved it!,"Item just as described, exactly what I was looking for. Great seller, item arrived in a timely manner. Thank you!"
3,More Examples!,"This book is factual, accurate, and authoritative. But I don't like technical books that read like technical books. ""Huh?"" you say.If I were to write this book, I would make it easier to understand with ample examples. It's better than Log Paser's Help, but not by a whole lot. I believe that technical books should be reasonably easy to understand - even by the non-technical.My 3 star rating is just my opinion/experience. Others may find this book to be just the ticket."
1,Absolutely Worthless,"This is one of the worst designed products I have ever seen. Within 5 seconds of opening the box, it's obvious the design has flaws because the adhesive tape won't stick to the toilet base, even without the heavy attachment. I bought two of this product from Lowes and intend to return both tomorrow. Unless you plan to superglue the base to your toilet, thoroughly destroying the toilet in the process, don't waste your time with this product. It's $4 for a reason."
1,Agree with the majority,"The same experience with me too. Very hard to open design even for Adults, the inner piece broke in 5-6 months. (I wonder why it stayed so long after seeing what poor quality the broken part was...).."
1,you get what you pay for,"We bought 2: The first broke during a baby shower within the first week. The second lock did not last until the end of the month. Even when the person knew how to open it, the sticky part would unstick and detach from the toilet pretty easily."
2,Didn't work on a wooden toilet seat,"if you have an antique-style wooden toilet seat, this is not the lock for you. It didn't fit our seat and lid."
1,Garbage!,"If I could give zero stars I would... Adhesive hardly sticks, directions are terrible. Once you finally get it on, it may keep your baby away, but adults in the house will have just as much trouble with it. Throwing this out and buying something else!Don't waste your money!"
1,junk!,"I agree, this is a piece of junk. No instructions whatsoever, and the adhesive does not work! very poor design- buy something else!"
1,This is garbage,"Do not buy this product. It doesn't even come with instructions and it broke while we were trying to ""install"" it."
1,Bad design,"My wife tried to install and could not even separate the clamp from the part that sticks to the side of the bowl. If your seat is a replacement and over hangs the side, forget about using this. If the bracket has to be moved, forget about it ever sticking again like the first time and if your lid is convex and not uniform in thickness underneath, also forget about using this one. It ended up in the trash for us."
1,assinine design,"This is HORRIBLE. First of all, what sort of safety product comes with no installation or use instructions? I'm smart, but that doesn't mean I automatically know how to install every product ever manufactured to manufacturer's specifications. Secondly, unless the front of the bowl of your toilet is flat (perhaps a cube-shaped bowl?), the adhesive will not stick to enough of the bowl to make the item secure. As other toilet parts also tend to curve (for example, a two flat pieces of adhesive are supposed to adhere to either side of your toilet lid, but the lids are often concave, so it's difficult to get a secure fit."
1,Doesn't even come with instructions,"What a waste of money!! I can't believe how awful this is. First there are no instructions, second the adhesive doesn't stick... can't even get this to stay on the toilet. Don't buy!"
1,inadequate adhesive,"This product's design relies entirely on a piece of double-sided adhesive to attach the latch hook to the toilet bowl rim. The adhesive simply isn't strong enough to do the job. It *is* difficult to open the toilet lid by opening the latch (as it should be: that's the whole idea), but this merely encourages the user to easily rip the entire latch and hook off the toilet rim. Once the adhesive has been ripped off the rim, the adhesive has lost much of its sticking power: you've got yourself a piece of plastic junk."
3,"Hard to use, but it works","This was the only toliet lock that has worked for us (we've tried four...) It certainly is not easy to use, but it does accomplish it's primary objective - keeping the baby safe.Two warnings: if you are lazy, you might get complacent and not use it because of the difficulty - not wanting to undo it each time. Same thing if you have a tiny bladder - don't wait till the last minute to pee!!!"
1,"Good concept, but it just doesn't work","I tryed these on my toilet. My One year old still would get in the toilet. One piece broke. Good think I had 2 of them:) I tried again. Same thing this time. After a few attempts, he could get in. Then they just came ""unglued."" So, maybe they will work on you toilet, but not mine."
1,Too difficult,This product was a waste of my money. It was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use. My husband tore it off the day after we got it. I would rather use duck tape then this product :) :)
1,"If I could rate this 0, I would. Gone through 2 in as many months.","My local hardware store didn't have any toilet tot locks, & the chain store only had this brand, one kind, no choices. The first one broke after 1 month of NORMAL use. The second broke after one month of NORMAL use. I would happily pay thirty bucks for one that would last more than a month & that I could give to someone else once my toddler is old enough to not try flushing toys down the toilet, but cheap sells. :-\ I refuse to pay for a THIRD one of these so I just hope we're not snaking toys out of the toilet at all. (I would put a door knob lock on the doors, but we have door knob covers from the same brand on our door knobs & those suck too!! If my toddler hits them hard & long enough, they just FALL OFF!!)"
5,"The book that answers the question, ""Is there a God?""","Is there a God? For centuries, man has searched for an answer. As one of the brightest and most influential Christian philosopher and evangelist of this century, Schaeffer presents an encyclopedic account of the answers offered by western philosophers and theologians from the time of Plato to the humanistic and existential movements of this century. On the basis of that analysis alone, this book is worth its weight in gold. But Schaeffer takes us one step further. He offers, not just the best, but the only viable answer to the ultimate question. God is truly there - real and personal.But how can anyone know Him? Because the God who is there has revealed Himself ...PLEASE BE WARNED: Reading this book could change your life."
4,Ojo De Dios,"The book when i recieved it was in good condition for the price. Everything in it was very readible and easy to follow, and it also gave good information about the ""god's eye"" in general.All in all it was a good book and i plan on getting others soon."
3,This book was okay.,"It kinds of leans towards Christianity a bit, but it's still a cute book. Not something a serious mythology reader would want though."
5,Back To the Past,"This book will appeal to anyone who ever lived on Unga Island or is related to someone or knows someone who lived there. Unga is a ghost town now, but reading about its past is very interesting."
3,Average.,"What we get from this commentary by Ralph Martin is his usual detailed examination. The Greek text, theological issues, and history of interpretation are tackeled head-long. Yet two points seriously undermine Martin from getting the title as the best on 2 Corinthians. First, he is strangely dry. Only the most daring of book-worms will be able to read this work for a prolonged period of time. Seondly, (and most important) he often fails to convince and his mirror-reading (of the adverseries of the Corinthians)too often stains his exegesis. We are left wondering what happened to Martin? The author of such notable works as the 'Carmen Christi', falls far short than his usual clear, thought-provoking material. If you want a better critical commentary seek M.E Thrall' multi-volumed works in the ICC series. For a better conservative read seek Paul Barnett in the NICNT.H.S Bultmann."
2,Disappointing,"Only a small section of this book talks about PRAYERS. The title of this book is misleading. I thought I will learn more about prayers but I was very disappointed. IF you want to know more about prayers, the other book by Charles Allen (All things are possible through prayers) will be your better bet."
2,whiny,"i don't get what all the fuss is about. the music is sugar-coated unoriginal fluff and the lyrics are about as whiny as you can get. and, i'm sorry, there is no comparison to the beatles. save your money"
5,As good as music gets.,"So they're the most impressive band playing in the country.So everyone who hears them only needs a second to become a fan.So radio won't play them.Why?Because mainstream radio is afraid of music that is talent based and not ""commercial"" (ie: if it hasnt been done before, they dont want it).Well do yourself a favor and give these guys a listen. Every album they put out bests their previous, one of the hardest feats imaginable. They are fantastic live.And if you are just looking for mellow songs to add to your mp3 list, get 'Ashes' for sure, and make sure you always have 'Give Back Yourself' somewhere. This is one of the all time great songs.Somewhere out there is a DJ who hates his boss because his boss won't let him play The Gufs.I hate him too."
4,"Still a great, great CD","I have bought THREE copies of this CD. Maybe four, I've lost count. Why? I keep LOSING it! Or I give it to radio station managers in the hopes it will catch on. But that isn't important...what is important is that I like it so much that I can't stand to be without it. You don't get many guys singing about where they went wrong, it's a refreshing change AND the music is excellent to boot. I heard ""Lake 17"" live in 1997...I'm glad it got a slot on this album. I sure wish I could hear all the other songs live one day....I can always hope! Buy this album. If you like the GooGoo Dolls, Matchbox 20, Jars of Clay...if you like these bands and you wish you could just find that one band that's better than all of them...this is it."
5,THE GUFS!!! THE BEST GROUP NOBODY KNOWS!!!!!!!!!,The Gufs are my second favorite group next to Garbage. I have all there CD's. The last CD was a masterpiece. So I had lofty expectations for this CD. I was not Dissapointed. This CD it great. Dare I say it might be better than the last CD (at least as good). Get this CD you won't be dissapointed!!!
3,Still a good read,"There really wasn't anything new in this book and a lot that has happened a few times before in this series. Johnstone is getting a little more ""preachy"" with the political dialogue."
4,A good read.....but that ENDING........,"I won't spoil anyone's reading, but this book had a cliffhanger style ending -- and I HATE cliffhangers! -- so that cost it one star.Still, an overall good read for the genre, in my humble opinion!"
1,Jumps the Shark,"Finally, being famous for being famous has jumped the shark. Some amusing moments, but really now, didn't this stuff die with Anna-Nicole Smith? Why not just get a season compendiums of the Larry Sanders Show?If you're a faithful fan of E! Network, give it a whirl. Otherwise, skip it. You won't miss anything."
4,If you love Electro Funk and heavy breathing this is it!,"I use to dance to the Egyptian Lover back in the late 80s. His songs were catchy, easy to remember (damn he repeated himself a lot), and had the 808 thump. Heavily influenced by the Freestyle/Afrika Bambaataa/Kraftwerk sound, he added the LA funk and casanova persona with that signature breathing. Some of these songs are kinda long and get a little similar but heard as singles or in shuffle mode with other songs, they still stand out. I dig Freak-A-Holic, Sexy Style and Egypt, Egypt. The Alezyby Inn is a great title. (What a naming genius!) The Lover was the Electro mack of the 80s and this stuff is still pimp for its genre."
3,Inconsistent,"This music book serves its purpose on a very BASIC level. The chord progressions for most Creedence songs are pretty simple. Therefore, it is hard not to get it right even by accident. Several of the songs are written in the wrong key but a good musician should be able to transpose. Most of the instrumental passages are missing(Gloomy, Suzie Q, Walk On The Water,Ramble Tamble, I Heard It Through The Grapevine). Long As I Can See The Light seems to be a little off with the piano notes. Most of the other piano music is pretty on the money. Cotton Fields is butchered on many levels. The guys only sing the first verse. If there is a book with tabilature out there and guitar solos written out, I would pass on this edition. However, beginners can certainly use this as it is kept very simple."
2,CCR,"Book is in good condition but content is not up to expectation.Very basic, simple chords progression, musical licks missing & not to original versions of CCR songs."
1,Barry White - Man is Back,"I have 20th century masters - the best of barry white the milliennium collection but Did not like this cd,"
4,Anorexia 101,"Quick paced. Short chapters. A fast, easy read. The most believable characters are the children. Mary Jane Clark knows how to weave a series of clues and events to keep the reader guessing and interested. A very good book to take with you on vacation or read by the fireplace on a snowy day. Although I realize that the theme of the tale is to point out the quantity and seriousness of eating disorders, the one thing that needled me was the number of characters suffering from eating disorders all in such close proximity."
4,Pretty Good Read,"This was a pretty good book. Not quite as good as a Mary Higgins Clark, but still ok."
2,"I never guess who the ""bad guy"" is...but I did with this...","This is the first time I've read this author. I thought the book started out ok. There were a few red herrings here and there, but overall, I thought it was a little boring. I think it could have used about 50 more pages of character development.This is good brain candy, if you like a predictable mediocre adventure."
3,Too predictable and a little boring....,"I purchased this novel because it looked to be a good summer read but I was very disappointed. The plot was thin, the characters weren't fleshed out and the story line was very predictable. The female main character lacked backbone and was placed in a position of constantly playing the victim - i.e., having her vacation cancelled by her boss and her husband in prison. Some of the characters were introduced and never fully explained and were left hanging at the book's end. Do yourself a favor and skip this one - it's really not worth the money."
1,Soapbox and boring,"As if the Jersey shore doesn't have enough ridiculous negative images to last several lifetimes, Ms. Clark adds to the bashing with this barely disguised murder mystery that is really a soapbox for anorexia and other teen problems. There is no point of view -- or should I say everyone possible's point of view.SPOILER ALERT:Honestly, could anyone believe that the anorexic young woman who rarely eats would be capable of dragging a body larger than herself more than a few feet, let alone into the neighboring town -- AND without being seen by anyone? This is beyond poor writing and a total waste of time."
4,not bad,I got these for my 7.1 rear speakers and it made it easier to establish a solid connection in a tight space.
3,"don't know, was a gift",This was a gift to my grandchildren. I saw it when I was younger and loved it.
5,A wonderful movie... 5 stars for sure,"When I first saw this movie late at night a few summers ago on the Disney Channel, I loved it. Since then, it seems to get better everytime I watch it. I have recently gotten a dachshund, and we watch the movie together. My family loves it, and I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for good, quality, family entertainment. 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cute!,A co-worker told me about this movie and since I didn't find it at the local video rental store I purchased it for 9.99 on amazon. If you are a dog lover you will really enjoy this movie. It is so adorable! that poor Great Dane! What a riot to watch the mischief those Dachshunds caused.
5,lots of family fun,"A classic that many of us can remember seeing from our own childhood, this movie is great family fun. I haven't seen it in years but it came up in conversation recently and it was great seeing it again. Highly recommended."
5,Love this movie!,"This is a classic Disney movie, for any generation. I was so excited to find it for rent/own on Amazon! Any dog-lover, especially dachshunds, would enjoy this light-hearted movie. I recently rented it for my children to watch, even in 2012 kids still enjoy this classic. My children were laughing out loud at parts, just as I did as a child and my mother before me."
5,cute,"This is a nice family, fun movie, worth watching. Have dachunds of my own and it was a great movie."
5,Ugly dachsund,"I consider this movie ""Disney at its best"". It is fun, wholesome. This is the type of movie that the entire family can watch and share some laughs. I wish there were more movies like that. It is a must see."
2,the ugly dachshund,"This movie first of all came in late, was not cellophane wrapped, the cover looks like it been submerged in water and had a receipt sticking out the top. But what do you expect for a $5.00 DVD!!I can say 99.9% of the other DVDs' that I have purchased in the past, whether they cost me $20.00 or even $1.50, never came it looking like this one."
3,Disappointing,Very typical Disney plot from this time period. My grandaughter got bored.(age 3) I was bored too. Her friends had the movie already and they loved it. (ages almost 4 and 6). It may depend on the individual.
4,"Before ""Best in Show"" there was The Ugly Dachshund","Fun flick for dog people, non-dog people, cat people, families and singles who enjoy 1950s-60s Disney comedies. Suzanne Pleshette and Dean Jones in their prime. If you are a fan of Dachshunds or Great Danes you are in for a real treat!"
5,Funny,This show is funny and quite. My son has a great dane and I have a dachshund. I thought it was a perfect present!
4,"Family fun, done right!",Thanks Disney for releasing this movie on DVD. Thanks for putting it out in the proper ratio. Thanks for adding nice bonus features. Thanks all around. This movie was a special part of my childhood. I can still remember watching my dear dad laughing at this delightful movie.
5,Great family movie,"Great classic and family movie from my childhood. Still laugh at the good, clean humor today. I would recommend it to anyone...especially dog lovers."
5,Fun Movie,My kids watched this movie over and over when they were younger and they still enjoy it- as does my one year old Granddaughter. It is just a nice fun family movie!
5,Best biography on Baum yet,"Since his death in 1919, Baum's life story has been told in at least one movie, a documentary, multiple children's biographies, articles, and several books. Comparing most of these to Katherine Rogers' new biography on the creator of the great American fairy tale, her's boldly stands out. While the book does have an uneven amount of insight into Baum's connection to the Women's Suffrage Movement and his practicing of Theosophy, this may the most complete look at Baum ever printed up to now."
4,Competent Biography,"L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz is a necessary books for fans of Oz. Katharine M. Rogers provides a clear, balanced examination of the details of his life and includes analysis, and relates it to his life, of his writings, both Oz and other. The most important aspect of this book are the sections describing his other (often) successful series for children, such as Aunt Jane's Niece, which are little known today. The weakness of the book is the fact that outside of his writing, Baum's life is not particularly exciting. It seems very pleasant and homey and I could not be happier for him, but it does not always make for thrilling reading. Still, Baum fans will be delighted to have his entire story told so compentently with the added bonus of the author's informative analysis."
1,Goes SLOW,It goes really slow. The mouse battery also only lasts about 1 minute then you have to recharge it. It is also difficult to steer and gets stuck very easily.
1,i wish i could give no stars.,this piece of junk would not even open so I can put the battery. everything was wrong with it. even the wheels on the mouse were rusty.
2,Such high hopes!,"I was so excited to give this to my cats on Christmas morning. They showed little interest. It's really hard to control, and it has to be charged after a minute of use. I think it's a great theory, but it just didn't pan out as I had hoped. There are probably better remote controlled mice out there, but this simply did not cut the mustard."
2,Not enough charge,"My cats liked it but the stupid thing, after charged, only holds 30 seconds to a minute of the charge, only works on hard surfaces, the wheels get stuck,it only goes in reverse for 5 seconds and turning doesn't work after the next second.Why can't someone make one that lasts longer like the toy cars?This isn't worth it. Save yourself time, batteries and money and attach a mouse to a string.Maybe I will just buy a remote controlled car. My cats won't know the difference."
1,CHEAP JUNK,Worked great .... for less than ten minutes then the mouse (which you must attach to battery module) would not charge. DONT BUY.
1,awful,Unfortunately I bought it with a coupon on petrx.com so the item is only worth $4 they claim and the postage to ship it back cost more than that. I am very disgusted with petrx. com in general and will not be coming back. Furthermore this device is a shame. It is terrible to recharge and lasts 10seconds do not get it! It went straight into the garbage.
1,Mouse Dead on arrival.,"I like the idea of a remote control mouse and know my daughter's cats would have loved it. However the sad reality is when this item arrived it didn't work. The mouse is literally dead on arrival. I'm going to return it and reget the time and effort I spent ordering it. I don't like writing bad reviews for a product, but anyone ordering this needs to know what a low quality item this is."
1,"Awful, save your money.","I have bought two of these and neither work. I can open the package, charge it, but the mouse won't move. Save your money, buy something else."
4,micro-mouse cat toy,"This is a hoot when you finally get it going. i.e., I found the instructions for opening the package were less instructive than they could have been, and the battery scheme is not for the electronically challenged. Don't remember if package info says or not, but this doesn't do well on anything but hard-surface flooring."
2,No mighty mouse,"The You-tube kitten chasing the remote control mouse inspired me to purchase this product. My cats look bored in its presence and it has not had the desired effect.This mouse is slow and steering is difficult. Charging it is complex and seating and removing the mouse in the charge assembly lacks readable directions.On the other hand, the customer service department is great. If only my cats thought the mouse was as good."
2,It sucks,"Charge it for a minute then runs for about 10 seconds and stops. It is annoy to go and get it and charge it again. My cat loves it but its a burden to play with him with it.I got this cause I am lazy to run with a toy mouse. So the remote control mouse was suppose to have me kick back on the couch and have my cat go nuts.It is a good idea but it needs a longer battery run time! Come on at least use a cell battery.Have a better run time, at least 30 min or an hour not 20 seconds.2 stars for the idea, if some one finds better let me know."
1,forget it!,"i had been looking for a toy like this for a long time. when i did find this one, i had my doubts since it already looked kind of whimsical to begin with. anyhow (and as already stated in other reviews), the initial set up is everything but intuitive. as for the running time of the mouse - i'd say mine lasts a whopping 2 minutes after every charge. needless to say that this is going to be returned...i have to conclude: my cats still get a bigger kick out of the ordinary (= low tech) mouse-toys that feature small bells and/or feathers."
1,poor product,This is poorly made - runs 5 seconds then stops. Then you charge it but it may or may not run for another 5 seconds. Very poorly made. And I bought 2 of them. Lucky me.
1,Almost DOA,"What a good idea! Oh boy! Expectations of fun!We charged the mouse. It lumbered slowly for a few seconds. Our cats watched, fascinated. Suddenly, the mouse died. Dead. Never to lumber again. End of story.Save your money and look elsewhere!"
1,Didn't work,"The battery cover had a screw on it that was really hard to get off, then put in 2 AA batteries and let it charge numerous times yet the product never worked. I tried other batteries, tried charging it a different way. Still didn't work.Waste of money"
5,my cat's love this,"You charge it off the controller and it lasts about 1-2 minutes, the cat likes to chew the tail (antenna off) Steers ok, average speed across the floor. not good on carpet. I like it"
2,Fun while it lasts,"I, too, was inspired by the YouTube video of the kitten chasing this remote control mouse. Perhaps I got a dud, but it only runs on the hardwood floor, backs up straight, but moving forward veers to the left and runs out of steam after about 30 seconds... it takes 45 to charge it! Putting the mouse back onto the main unit to charge it is quite difficult. If it isn't aligned just exactly so, the charge light doesn't light and it won't charge.The cats LOVE it... when it works. I only gave it 2 stars because they do love it and it provides great exercise for my indoor kitties.I will definintely be looking for an alternative remote control mouse since they love it so much."
2,Disappointed...,"The only good thing about this product is it charges in 45 seconds which is pretty fast. However, the charge only holds for like 2 mintues and the mouse is NOT fast as you would expect it to be. Literally just about at 2 mintues the thing starts to slow down and die. Not worth the time to re-charge and I wouldn't purchase again unless the charge lasted for much, much longer."
1,Micro Mouse is cute but a waste of money,"This product is a good idea, but poorly engineered. I purchased mine about a week ago. Mostly cons on this item. 1. Very difficult to attach the mouse to the docking unit to charge. 2. Directly out of the box, the mouse was impossible to steer. It wants to go in circles. I found the adjustment on the bottom of the mouse, but even after multiple adjustments the mouse had a mind of it's own. It will not go straight. The steering works somewhat but the mouse movements are jerky and unpredictable. 3. After a few uses, the mouse has slowed down considerably to the point where it almost will not run after a full charge. Pro...cat loves the mouse. These are a very cheaply made product that doesn't work well and doesn't last long. Quality control on this product is nonexistant."
1,Horribly built!,"We bought our's from another store but I felt compelled to write a review anyway. This product is cheaply and poorly made! The rear wheels, the drive wheels, will shift to one side so that the gears will not mesh. All you hear is the little electric motor grinding away but the toy goes nowhere. I'd suggest finding a better-made product - we're still looking for one."
3,Not the best quality,"it dosnt turn very well it did at first but after a few minutes playing with it, it stoped responding when you whant it to turn, the cats still like it"
1,Horrible,I hated it. Sure it looked nice but it broke within 3 weeks. It's a peice of junk and I do not reccomend that anyone ever buy this!
4,Classic karate text by one of the 70's karate 'hard men',"Back in the 1970's Pete Spanton was one of the best known British Karate instructors. He practised a style called Wado Ryu which this book focuses on. I used to own this book (but have no idea where it is now). My memories are of grainy black and white photos showing basic moves, kata and free fighting techniques. A classic 1970's approach to this kind of manual and light years away from the glossy, colour coffee-table tomes that abound these days. It's out of print now but if you can get a copy then hang on to it."
5,She is one God's Precious' Angels with a gift!,"This cd is what has been keeping me strong i would recommend cd to anyone who has been going through alot. It is not only uplifting, It is inspiring to help you to go on because with these trying times in our lives we need to be closer to God. Thanks Dottie!"
5,A Real Help in Understanding God and Growing in Him,"I agree with all of the reviews written so far. I bought this book, because a woman I admire greatly recommended it when I was looking for something for a women's summer Bible study. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the book in time for the summer study, but I began reading the book myself at the end of the summer. I am just beginning the 6th week of the 40-day journey, and I am astounded at how much more I understand God and myself and how much deeper my relationship is with God as a result. I feel I have grown more and come to know God at greater levels in the past 5 weeks than I have in some years since I've known Christ as my Savior. Not only do I highly recommend this book, but I will purchase this book to give as gifts and will most likely lead a study of the book next summer. It is truly awesome!"
4,Fuel Pressure adapter,This tool is extremely handy and easy to install. It made it easy to fine tune fuel pressure on GM TBI systems
2,Merely An Analysis of Noir,"This is a book about Noir, much like a book one would have to study for a college course on Noir, there are no stories. Most of the contributing writers seem to be unknown. Suspect few need or want this book."
3,Reading music isn't the easiest thing to learn but...,"Since many students are no longer taught how to read music in school early in elementary school, this book is a good starter for those who want to not just play music, but how to understand all the different areas that sheet music covers. Basic explanations are used, and then examples are shown. If you have an older child or teen that wants to learn to read sheet music for choir, this is a good guide."
1,"""staff"", not ""stave""","What especially annoys me about this book:1) It speaks repeatedly of a ""stave"". (Just as the implement you cut your roast beef with is a knife, not a knive, just as your spouse--if you're male--is your wife, not your wive, just as what falls from a tree in autumn is a leaf, not a leave, the singular form of ""staves"", in the musical sense of the word, is ""staff"", not ""stave"".)2) Its presentation of rhythm is muddled, inaccurate, and often just plain wrong.3) It talks down to you, insults your intelligence."
3,Why did I buy this again?,I have'nt throughly looked through it but seems to be in good condition even though it's used love the simplicity of using it. And how it goes in depth and how you can practice with it using other instruments if u have one. So that's a great feature of the book.
5,Recoton SP2,I am very happy with this piece needed to play my vinyl recordings. The music sounds just as it should when the records were made; a nice vintage sound is what I want to hear.
4,Vinyl is King,It's great to be listening to my old vinyl after 20 years. One channel of the preamp quit working once but I unplugged the power for a couple of days and it worked again.
1,do not buy this brand,"Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
5,The old record player - back in service,"This product allowed me to connect my old turntable to a new amplifier - as you know if you are reading this, they don't make the 'phono' inputs on amps any more. Just plug it into AUX you say! Sorry - you need a device to amplify the turntable output to line level as well as to process it to the correct standard. This device does this - it is powered (requires an AC outlet) so no worries about batteries. It is light and unobtrusive - once you get it connected you never need think of it again. You might get a hum, if you do not have a ground terminal to connect to the thin wire coming out of your turntable. They don't put those on the amplifiers any more either. I found that if I connected the ground wire to the red audio input jack on this pre-amp that the hum completely disappeared. I just slipped it inside the red RCA cable when I pushed it onto the preamp, and it's a very snug pressure fit. It's not going to fall out."
3,A Review,"I bought this thing to connect my old Technics turntable to my component CD Recorder. While it works as advertised, the assembly was a bit shoddy - to wit: The guts (including both sets of RCA connector jacks) were inadequately secured to the body shell - making connection a very dicey matter. With some perseverance and a pair of needle nosed pliers, I was able to get things connected, but a lot of swearing was involved in the process. If any children or pets had been nearby, they would probably have been scarred for life.Once the connections were made, the unit operated as it was intended."
2,CD broken,The CD was all scratched up. My readers that need more guidance in reading were disappointed that they couldn't be read to.
5,My kids love the book and the audio,My 2 and 4 year old both love the book and the audio. They will play it over and over again. Now both of them can tell the story themselves!
4,I am not going to get up today,"I am not going to get up today is an exciting, silly story. It is about a boy who doesn't want to get up for school, and he swears that nothing in your wildest imagination will get him up. Seuss, the author, has some crazy ideas as to what would normally wake people up, but in this case, nothing will make this imaginative child get out of bed."
1,Dr. Seuss hits rock bottom,"My wife and I finally stored this book away, because there is nothing redeeming about the message, and it's not particularly creative in any respect either. The book dwells on a boy's obstinance/refusal to get out of bed for an entire day...what a wonderful thought to put in the head of our children. The kid refuses entreaties from his mother and even the police to get out of bed and go to school, and in the end, they just let the kid stay in bed and sleep. So...the message for my 2 year old is: defy your parents long enough, engage in anti-social behavior, and they will give in and let you have your way. I still have to wonder whether Dr. Seuss actually wrote this one. It's just horrid, and the rhymes are like a 6th grader's first attempt at poetry. Blech!"
4,Hidden gem - give it a chance.,"Though this isn't as sublime as Argybargy or East Side Story, there are a lot of great tracks on here, with just a couple of fillers.The band stretches out in ways that, perhaps, some Squeeze fans are not accustomed to. Melody Motel is a classic piece of irony, pairing music straight out of an evening at your local 'good times' honky-tonk, with a dark tale of personal misery. Is It Too Late? takes them rockabilly in a way that never fails to get me bouncing. And while Dr. Jazz finds Jools Holland gone completely bayou, Chris Difford's tune Slaughtered, Gutted and Heartbroken is nearly Cole Porter.As evidenced by the first track, the band is really having fun on this album, so loosen up and let yourself stretch with them. You won't be disappointed."
4,Brings back old memories,"The thing I love about Amazon is that I can find 99% of the old movies I once enjoyed and thought were lost forever.This movie was one I wanted to see again and was so happy to find it. It is a ""feel good"" kind of movie, has a great cast and we enjoyed watching it."
5,Heartwarming,Wow such a young Robert Mitchum! He really was a great actor too along with many others! This story was so nice to watch as this family struggled through life. What a great example of family life of long ago! Worth having in my collection and to view over and over again! I liked this movie very much!
5,Great film,This is a wonderful film from top to bottom. Perfect cast and compelling story without anything getting blown up or cheating on their spouse.This is a story of a family of movers in Australia and their lives as they move from job to job. They have some small adventures and ups and downs but its just a nice story about people who care about each other
5,The Sundowners 1960,"* First-Rate . The Entire Cast is Exellent * It's tough driving 1.200 sheep across 400 miles of hostile outback but for drovers Paddy and Ida Carmody and Son Sean , it's the only job there is . Poor in possession , they're rich in freedom , adventure and love . Four-time Academy Award winner Fred Zinnermann (1907-1997) directs this warmhearted tale of 1920 Australia . Robert Mitchum (1917-1997) and Deborah Kerr (1921-) play Paddy and Ida , a devoted couple suddenly at odds . She and Sean ( Michael Anderson Jr 1943 - ) want a farm of their own . But settling down is more than Paddy untethered spirit can bear . THE SUNDOWNERS earned five oscars nominations including Best Picture , won Kerr the New York Film Critics Best actress Award and made Mitchum the National Board of Review Best Actor choice for this and HOME FROM THE HILL (1960) say g'day to a movie treasure . High Quality Transfer . Highly Recommended ."
3,Star Performances Are Better Than the Film,"The movie takes place in the outback of Australia. It is about an itinerant family of sheep tenders: Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchem, and friend Peter Ustinov. The scenery and the acting is far better than the movie plot itself. With lessor actors, this would have a totally boring movie, but with these fine actors, it is pretty good. I give it 4 stars for acting and 2 for everything else. A movie that should be reserved for TV."
4,The Sundowners,"The Sundowners with Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles is a wonderful,family movie that depicts a time gone by in Australia. As an older movie, it has what many modern movies do not - heart, a genuinely good story and a reminder of strong family values. The trend these days is to stay more home-bound, appreciate what we have and learn to make do in tough times. This timeless movie fits perfectly with this trend. It wraps comfortably around you like a warm blanket."
3,Great Robe but Difficult to Keep Closed,"This robe is incredibly comfortable and the perfect length. It is, however, difficult to keep this robe closed. However, I think this is the nature of the fabric and not a flaw of this particular robe. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
3,wish it were as soft on the inside,I bought this robe for my teen daughter because she is always borrowing my silk robe. This was cheaper than buying her a silk robe and she likes it. It seems sturdily made. It is very sleek and soft on the outside. I would prefer to have the sleek/soft part on the inside. The inside is not so soft but it's okay for anyone who isn't used to wearing silk.
4,Robes,"I ordered these as bridesmaids gifts and had them embroidered. I ordered size small but they ran a little big and you couldn't get them any smaller. It was a good product though! I cut out the shoulder pads because I wasn't sure why they were necessary in a robe - Easy to do though, and didn't mess anything up!"
5,exactly what i was looking for,love this robe! the sash attaches on one side so it doesn't get all twisted up. washed and dried 4x and it still looks new. i took the shoulder pads out with no problem. it makes a terrific travel robe as it folds really flat. it's really hard to find one of these with this quality - most others are cheaply made of cheap fabric and don't hold up
4,Exactly what it says it is.,"I ordered two--one in black and one in ivory--and I'm pleased with them. There are shoulder-pads, which are ridiculous, given that the pads fall far past my actual shoulders (and my shoulders are narrow, but not *that* narrow), but taking those out won't destroy the robes. The belt-loops are definitely high, so that throws off the shape a little, and if you're naturally very low-waisted I wouldn't recommend them, but the robes themselves are nicely-made, soft, and pretty. If you're looking for a good robe for a good price, this is a very attractive option. (ETA: When I bought these, they were $15 apiece. For 30, I might still buy them, but I'd have a look around first.)"
4,Mom Loved it!,"Bought this as part of a Mother's Day gift package. My mom loves them, and she has a rich snob's taste."
4,just like the picture,The robe looks just like it does in the picture. The fact that it has shoulder pass is rather odd but other than that the robe is pretty nice(:
1,Waste of money,the socks come with a pocket for the heat pads which get so red hot through movement that it burns. the socks without the hot packs are great and warm enough. those heat pad things are dangerous in my opinion.
3,Big socks,"These socks were ordered for a 14 year old girl. The small size was ginormous. Check sizing before ordering. Quality seemed pretty good, but they have never been used."
2,"Great socks, chemical packets do NOTHING!","These are fine, thick, well-made socks. Yippee-skip, I could have gotten THAT anywhere for half the price. What sold me was the LIE that the stupid chemical packets would do a thing. They did NOTHING. I am not saying they were inadequately warm, I'm saying they produced no heat at all! I just got back from four hours of freezing my feet off at the stadium watching my team lose, and as soon as my feet flaw out, I'd like to put one of them right up this company's...!You want nice, thick socks? Fine, buy them. Just don't think the stupid chemical packets will help. If you want extra heat on a cold day, set fire to the socks."
3,NOT Made in USA,One of the reasons I purchased this particular pair is because the product description said that this item is made in the USA. If this is something you care about you should be aware that this may be out of date. The pair I received is clearly marked Made in China. As this was to be a gift for someone who prefers not to buy things made in China I was pretty disappointed.I can't speak to the quality of the product itself since they weren't for me and I haven't worn them.
3,Received 2 different size socks,"The socks are great, but I received 2 different size socks :( I was away when they arrived and didn't check until I was traveling again and couldn't return them..."
2,Bulky and Ineffective,No good for skiing. To bulky to fit in boots and do not keep your toes warm (lack of oxygen?). Disappointing.
1,Not comfortable,These are just regular socks and when you put the hand warmer in it is difficult to walk comfortably because of the extra bulk. Works ok while sitting and you can loosen your laces.
2,Not What I Expected,I had a book likened to this one when I was a child and by no means is there any comparision. My childhood one was the best too bad I lost it through the years.
1,Good Title Poor conversion,I boght this book for the Kindle and I must say the conversion is so horrid that it is nearly impossible to read. If you have an option get the hardcover edition.
2,"South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu","This Kindle Edition of this book is almost impossible to read. While it was probably a very informative book in its original form as either a hardbound or paperback book, unfortunatly the translation to the electronic version for Kindle readers completely sucks. Who ever your proofreader is, if you even used one, should be fired. I wasted my money. It would take too long to describe all the mistakes made in the translation of this book to electronic print. The only thing impressive about it was the unreadability of it."
1,A Pathetic Job EBook Conversion,"The ""book"" is virtually unreadable! Pages are duplicated, etc, I have the original book in my library; this electronic attempt is a travesty. I cancelled it."
2,A good book poorly imaged in Kindle format.,"I obtained the e-book after reading the publication years ago. I was chagrined to note numerous issues with the format including illegible inserts, mismatched typefaces and other annoying issues, That said I recommend the print version as an excellent addition to anyone interested in the early, fluid phases of the Korean War."
2,"Great book, poor Kindle edition","Unfortunately, this wonderful book has been done a great disservice by the quality of its Kindle edition. The digital edition has numerous errors, like duplicated and unfinished sentences appearing chaotically on many of its pages. I'm afraid I couldn't give this Kindle edition more than two stars. Hopefully, a newer, error free, edition will become available in the future."
4,Professional Induction?,"Just got this pot delivered. I am very happy with the heavy, thick base. Hopefully, this will be great for an all-purpose pot, though I specifically wanted something for deep-frying. One question though: the pot had a sticker on it that said, ""Professional Induction"". Was this pot made primarily for an induction-type range?"
5,Love Emile Pandolfi,"I would give Emile Pandolfi Five Stars for any of his Albums, I enjoy piano music. So I bought this one Too!"
3,"The Weakest Season of B5, But Still Worth Watching","I *love* B5 in so many ways, but the 5th season irks me. I just don't like it that much and wish that JMS had come up with a different way of wrapping up the amazing five-year arc. Just my opinion.I bought this to complete my collection, and I'm glad to have it (and even to watch it on occasion)!"
4,Thanks for a Wonderful Series,"Anyone who is a fan of Babylon 5 will or has already bought this 5th and final DVD set. This was the year that almost was not. Thanks to TNT, Warner Bros. gave JMS the go-ahead to complete this wonderful story. The 5th season set of Babylon 5 wraps most of the major plotlines that all B5 fans have watched unfold through the entire series.The last few episodes from ""The Fall of Centauri Prime"" right on up to ""Sleeping in Light"" are all stellar pieces of good story telling. The sense of family and a bond between all of the major characters can be felt as each go their separate ways only to be reunited some years later in the touching finale.Thanks J.MichaelStraczynski for giving us such a wonderful TV series. I don't think I'll ever see anything like this in my lifetime again. Just wonderful."
5,Wow!,"Some people regard season 5 as the weakest of the seasons, but having watched it again for the first time since it's original TV airing, I would have to strongly disagree. In fact, season 5 connected with me at a very emotional level---in ways far beyond the other seasons. This is a season of big ideas; accepting the consequences of actions, making choices, redemption, forgiveness, starting over, the nature of power, nonviolence, and more. A few months after the original airing of season 5, I got rid of my TV and haven't watched much since (going on 6 years). Now, I know why---it doesn't get any better than this! Thank you Michael Straczynski!"
4,Still looks good even after all this time,"It was great to revisit this old friend! I promptly went out and bought the rest of the five seasons of the series. I was afraid that the effects would look cheesy compared to today's modern effects, but not bad at all. It feels like re-reading Lord of the Rings after years away, you can't wait until you get to see your favorite scenes over again. Good fun!"
2,Babylon 5 - The Complete Fifth Season,This is an alright set but I though it was a disapointing and unsatisfying end to a great scfi series.
3,The only real disappointing season,"The end of Season Four was rushed since JMS wanted to make sure his story was told. The series finale on the last disc of Season Five was shot a year earlier since they thought the series had wrapped. This fact makes Season Five seem more disjointed than the others. The Telepath Colony/Byron storyline that dominated much of the first half of the season was never very engaging. A few setup episodes leads to The Fall of Centauri Prime which could have saved the season, but it came too late to do it justice.All in all, an adequate wrap-up to a great series, but not the excellence that it could have been if network politics had not intervened.The DVDs themselves and extras were good, but the video transfers do not seem as good as previous sets."
5,Perfect,"This was perfect for my Dad, he LOVES Babylon 5 and I helped my Mum purchase these for a much smaller price than else where. Good for your money"
4,Excellent end to an excellent series,Season 5 ends with a bang. This series was an excellent change of pace to a die hard sci fi fan.
2,Babylon's worse,"** SPOILERS HERE!** Don't read if you haven't seen season 4!!! I hope my title doesn't turn you off to at least RENTING the last of the Babylon series; Compared to the previous 4, I found this last season lacking in SO many ways; Poor acting, bad story lines. I missed Ivanova, and didn't realize how integral she was to the SHOW till she was gone (sigh). But being the ending SEASON, if you hare a die-hard fan, you HAVE to see the last season. Still has the ground-breaking special effects and the effervescent Bruce Boxleitner, but (groan), I sincerely think true-blood FANS of the show will be disappointed! Let me know what YOU think!!"
4,Denouemout,"The fifth season of Babylon 5, while still stellar, is not quite up to par with the third and fourth seasons. This is because it's telling the end of the story--it starts later in the arc that originally intended (S4 was originally supposed to end with Intersections in Real Time), and because of the loss of the key character Ivanova.That said, it is still excellently made and it is a wonderful conclusion to the story that is Babylon 5. Be on the lookout for a movie to be released in theatres soon. :)"
3,Why is the picture quality so bad on many DVDs?,"I have already seen the series on over the air TV and expected to get better quality picture when I buy it on DVD. Unfortunately this is not the case. Like so many DVDs it's a torture to watch with a projector. Companies worry so much about piracy and lost revenue, but on the other hand they don't give customers value for money by producing a good quality product. I think any amateur with a cheap latest generation video camer and software a can burn a DVD with better quality picture.I bought the DVD for some $40, it arrived yesterday and noticed that meanwhile it's been reduced to $23.90. The reduced price is acceptable if you are a fan of the series."
3,Left a lot unexplained,"This last year, while not bad in and of itself, was a great disappointment to those who believed Creator/Writer/Executive Producer J. Michael Straczynski when he repeatedly promised that all questions would be answered by the end of the series. Even assuming one changes that to be ""major questions"" this season falls very short. Two of the biggest issues left to novels to resolve is how Vir becomes Emporer and, even more glaringly, all details of the Psi Corps War. I also found it unnerving that Sheridan becomes very unilateral if not downright dictatorial, and his passing literally invokes Jesus Christ as a metaphor. While I still recommend the season as being pretty good Science Fiction, it doesn't live up to previous seasons."
4,Somewhat Anti-climatic,"The fifth season of Babylon 5 was excellent, and wrapped up the series, concluding the longest mini-series in television history. Unfortunately, it ends up being rather anti-climactic. With the Shadow War and the Earth Civil War both concluded in the fourth season, it just has no place to go here. The character pieces with Londo trapped as the new Emperor of the Centauri Republic and Garibaldi falling back into alchoholism are powerful and interesting, but can't match the action of the Earth civil war. In the final analysis, a good series with good stories, but not up to the standards of previous seasons."
4,Babylon 5/5,Wraps up a very exciting season but as all really good stories you just hate to see it end.
5,Two for one special,"At the beginning of the fourth season, JMS was told he would only be able to do four seasons, instead of his planned five.So all the action and plans he had scheduled for the last two seasons are jam packed into one season, and it will leave you breathless as the Ancient Argument and Earth War are shown to their conclusion.Of course, at the end of season four, he was told there would be five seasons. What his response was, we'll never know, though it would probably be censored."
4,Second Half of Season a great finish,"As others have said, the first half of the 5th season was quite disappointing. But once the character of Byron was killed off, the series returned to the high quality of seasons 2-4 to finish off the 5 year story in spectacular fashion. Some fans were upset that the show didn't tie up every last plot thread, but the show did wrap up the story of Babylon 5's crucial years quite well.The quality of the dvd set is good, but not great. The extras are okay. The series itself is what drives the sales of these DVDs, and most B5 fans will want to own the last half of season five."
2,should have stopped with season four,"It really seems as if the writers were using the story arc as a crutch for so long they forgot how important plot is. Most of these episodes are downright aimless, and the few plot turns are less than intriguing. No help that the acting is worse than the prior seasons, either. Luckily the last episode, which was apparently filmed at the end of season four, keeps this from being a total waste of time. Probably a good choice for Babylon 5 zealots who need that one last fix (and somehow missed the endless reruns on cable)."
3,S & W tactical knife,"Unlike any other knife I own. Very different shape and style.Its got a very sturdy feel, a very thick back on the blade,very aggressive thumb groves,The handle material is a little to slippery for my liking.The knife sheath is made of a plastic material which grips and holds theknife in it with great vigor, it takes some tricks to get it out of thesheath.Over all I like the knife and quite sure it will find a home in one ofmy bug out bags."
4,DAILY CARRY KNIFE,"I carry this knife almost every day and it has held up well, especially the finish. I love the sheath. I wish it was a better quality steel though. The edge just isn't that good nor have I been able to get it where I want it."
1,MADE IN CHINA,Smith and Wesson are killing their reputation by selling items made in China. The sheath is plastic and useless for a boot knife since the entire thing comes out when pulling. It does not keep an edge very well and it's too heavy for its size. My suggestion is move on and get something better for a bit more money.
2,Ok for a boot knife,It is very tought to pull this knife from the sheath. It has kind of a funny feel and balance. Not crazy about it. It does feel tough like it would stand up to abuse. Good for a boot tucker and not much else.
4,"Great knife, lousy sheath","This knife holds an edge well (with a little stone work) and is great for an underhanded grip in dangerous situations. That being said, the sheath design is a bit...backwards. The best way to work the knife out of its sheath is to press forward/down with the thumb on the sheath side opposite the blade. The drawback to this is that the sheath gets needlessly slashed by the knife every time it's pulled. Still, this knife is of good quality. 4 stars for the knife; -1 for its sheath."
4,Smith & Wession SWHRT1 Tactical Boot Knife - Choice !!!!,"Smith & Wession SWHRT1 Tactical Boot Knife - Choice !!!! Received in a timely manner well worth the money, ingenious holster, built well. More than satisfied for the money and thinking about buying another one actually."
4,Stab Them!,Pretty awesome knife. Use it in Iraq alot. Breached a tent with it! haha...anyway the clip isn't all that great when you pull the knife out sometimes the case comes with it. WACK.BUT the knife it's self is amazing!
2,sheath,"I like that it is secure in the sheath. However, when I have it on my belt and try to pull it from the sheath, the belt clip lets go of my belt and the knife is still sheathed."
5,"a complex and rich experience, time after time","I've had this music for 14 years now, and it has never palled. Passionate and urgent rhythms, lyrics layered with rich images (no standard romance crap here!), and stirring guitar work. It's just such a wonderful album. Why it never made much of a splash can only be down to poor marketing. I wish Gordon Peterson would put something else out to complement this gem! You will not regret buying this album."
5,"Hard Sun, thanks to Vedder for the remake","Although I appreciate Eddie Vedder resurrecting Hard Sun, I prefer the original version. Hopefully the popularity of this song will get this album re-released. A resell for $89 is ridiculous. Makes me think file sharing isn't such a bad thing."
5,Put this into the CD player and just chill,"I'm listening to this CD that I paid a premium for because it's rare, but it was so worth the price! Eddie Vedder's remake of Hard Sun made me want to look up the original artist and I bought it based on the strength of that song alone. I suppose you could call it a blend of ""old"" U2/Sting/Midnight Oil. It's great to just listen to the whole thing from start to finish.Yeah, this is not really a review of the CD, but it is really good to listen to this. The recording audio quality is very good, too."
1,terrible,"The screws that come attached to the bedposts are not long enough to be inserted into the holes of the planks. It's also impossible to see what you are doing when trying to bang the screw into the hole with a rubber mallet (mallet not included). Also, it's a terrible idea to bang the posts into place with a rubber mallet, because it the rubber makes a black imprint all over the wood. While I was banging the pieces into place, the screws ripped off. I've put together many beds, and this is the worst. An absolute piece of garbage. I phoned the company to tell them about my problems, and I encountered only rudeness and condescension. Avoid this company and this bed."
5,love songs,I had gone to a wedding recently were they played very nice solo piano music in the church while guests arrived. The music in the church was simply peaceful & indeed great romantic love songs for the prelude to the wedding. The music inspired me as an idea for a good friend who's son is getting married out of the country & many won't be able to attend. So I thought this CD would be great 'meet & greet' music for when he does return home to introduce his lovely bride to his family and friends. I am pleased with the music & my friend is elated for such a thoughtful gift.
1,Pearl Jam? Radiohead? -Blue Karma is not orignal,I checked this band out hoping to find a dimond in the rough. What I got was a CD with riffs from other well known bands....1 used CD for SALE!
3,Handle with Care and Watch the rating,"After contacting Reese on this I would change it to a 1 Star if I could. They started passing the buck to the fact that this is a ""TowPower"" part not a Reese part and they have no control. The part number has been discontinued by Reese and it is now rated at 8,000 pounds even though the website and this listing state 10,000 pounds.Be careful with this product and always make sure you have one ball attached to ensure that the retaining ball bearings to not fall out while it is in storage. I took a look at the other day and one of the ball bearings that acts as a retainer is missing. I will be contacting Reese for a replacement. The concerning thing is that I had not even used the hitch ball once when I noticed this problem."
5,ball,nice set up easy to use would recommend came quicker than expected smart thinking for interchangable hitch ball was put to use the day it came
5,Simple to use,The new system that allows you to switch ball sizes works really well. Much easier that the old pin system.
4,Very Nice,Appears very well made. Easy to use by twisting a button on top with a coin or screwdriver. This will be very handy.
5,I LOVE this book,It is an excellent book about how Val and Sabrina get traped in ancient Egypt--It Rocks!!!
4,Somewhat helpful....,"I checked out this book from the library and used it for my FIRST EVER miniature project - the Georgian dollhouse. The narrative instructions are a little hard to follow, (perhaps because the authors are British and I am not), and there are only a few basic diagrams. But after a few months of mild to moderate frustration, I had a beautiful product! I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who hasn't done any woodcraft or miniature projects, but for someone with a little experience, the end results can be worth the effort."
3,"More, please",There are only 5 designs for this book. I am happy to learn that there is a second book available. I want to see more. The victorian store and thatched cottage are very nice. The fisherman's cottage is excellent and really tempted me to buy this book (got this out at the library) I liked the goergian house as well but it lacked a second staircase so there was no entrance into the attic rooms.There are detailed instructions spanning many pages but I can see how some readers might find them a bit daunting. Also the photos are too dark.The tudor example given was an unusual design however there is no furnishings in the interior so it was not as inspiring.Pretty good book overall. I would recommend looking it over at the bookstore or in the library before you buy.
3,Awkward to mount,"We typically use the stroller with the baby facing us. In that setup, there is no way to mount this cleanly."
5,I'm very grateful to Amazon for having this set of Forever,"I'm very grateful to Amazon for having this set of Forever Knight episodes. I saw this episodes in the mid 90's, and I think that I'm lucky to be able to buy the last season of Forever Knight in Amazon. These episodes have profound existential philosophical messages. The writers of these episodes used the vampire story as a metaphor to give messages on immortality vs. humanism, power vs. love, survival of the fittest vs. sacrifice, and overall, redemption."
5,"Nick Knight, A vampire with humanity.","Nick Knight has more humanity than any mortal. When you purchase this trilogy and watch the last episode ""Last Knight"", then you'll know why Nick Knight has shedded his vampire killing for humanity."
5,Forever a fan,"Season 2 was my favorite, but I can't help lovin' the whole series! Thank you for making the show available to those of us Forever hooked!!"
4,"Great Show, Ahead of its time","This was a very good show that has been copied many times over the past few years. Although the special effects aren't always the greatest, the story will keep you coming back for more. A must have for any fan of the vampire genre."
4,Like this cheesy show,"I know it's a cheesy show, but I still love it. I used to stay up late at night to watch it as a kid and still do as an adult."
4,For a fan of vampires!,"If you like vampire series, this is one for you. For some reason, it was better back when i was younger. I did get the series and watched it. It started slow but picked up as you got into the series."
4,Forever Knight - TV Series,Boy did I imagine another ending - but this was appropriate - did they do a 2 hours movie to follow? I don't know ... Great series. Great condition from Movie Mars.
5,Forever KNight,"Excellent show! It is definitely one of the classics coming out of Canada in the 90's. Technically, the playback and delivery of the product was also very good."
5,Gone...A touch of real class!,"The whole series was one of my all-time tv favorites. So sad to see it leave. I do have a burning question to anyone who might help. In the episode ""Black Buddha"", a hauntingly beautiful song was sung during the opening scenes. It was ""Voodoo Black Magic"". I desperately want a copy of the full song. I have written to a Canadian radio personality who then forwarded (my email) to the agent of Molly Johnson, whom I believe sang that song, but she doesn't remember it. (I'm still sure it was her voice).Can anyone help?"
1,Very disappointing end of a great show.,I have loved the first and second season of this season but was very disappointed with this one. The characters lack the spunk that the other two season have and the ending is wreched.
1,Horrible ending,"This is the worst season ever! Nick, Natalie and the entire original cast have seen much better days in seasons 1 & 2. SPOILERS............First, Schanke gets killed off in the first episode. Then, Janette is absent for the entire season, except for one episode and when she does return, she's not the Janette we know and love! Thirdly, Vachon---what a sorry excuse for a vampire. Fourth, the new captain is a JOKE. Fifth they didn't know what they wanted to do with Lacroix and lastly Tracy Vetter...yuk!! Trust me---don't waste your money on this one!"
2,No narrative momentum.,"If you already have an intense interest in St. Foy, or in the Aveyron region of France, you will enjoy this book. It contains some beautifully written passages and warm, honest sentiment.It also contains a lot of minutely detailed descriptions of places, people, encounters, artistic impressions, religious experiences, scholarly and historical research, cultural observations... What it does not contain is any narrative momentum. All the lovely writing is strung together without any context. Who is this woman who went to all the trouble to document her experiences in Conques over the years? The reader is left with very little idea. After a while, you'll just want it to stop."
5,great remixes!,"i just noticed that this single had no reviews, so if you're wondering whether or not to pick it up maybe i can be of service to you.The Blood Is Love (Contradicktator Mix) FLAT OUT GREAT. Starts of with eerie atmospheric piano and a lonely cold rendering of Josh Homme's voice. Then it explodes into a drum 'n bass MARCH! It's hard to describe, but it's really really fun to listen to. One of the coolest remixes i've heard in a long long time.Little Sister (Contradicktator Mix) Almost like a techno lounge version of the song. Not quite as stellar as the Blood Is Love remix, but also very very enjoyable.All in all, it's totally worth the money. The remixes sound really fresh, they're anything but cookie cutter techno stamped versions of the songs."
4,very pretty color,"I bought 2 sets. They give off a pretty white light,with a bit of blue cast(I wasn't sure at first)They look very nice in the landescaping,they blend in. Have a nice brown color finish to them. I will buy another set."
3,Buyers beware!!!,"I purchased three sets of lights and they look nice, but the instructions say that you have to place each one five feet apart. I don't have that much space for six lights if that's the case. But, I am going to try to set them closer anyway because everyone else lights I've seen are not that far apart. I will report later how it works out."
5,I love it!,"Every day I look forward to the questions that this stirs up, as well as the bible reading and the prayers at the end of the daily passage. This is a great tool for self discovery while searching for life's purpose. I wish I'd found it sooner!"
1,Spanish book instead of English,Praying for Purpose for Women: A Prayer Experience That Will Change Your Life Forever (Pathway to Purpose)I ordered the English version of this book as well as a companion book by the same author. I was sent the Spanish version of this book & I'm still waiting to receive the English verson.
1,doesnt fit,"What a disappointment. This will not fit on my antenna. I was so looking forwardto placining it on my car,but NO. I just wasted my money."
5,Cute item!,"This was a great stocking stuffer gift! It was cute, reasonably priced and shipped quickly...great job by this seller!"
3,A great magazine article ... an uneven book,"I bought the book after reading David Brooks' similar article in the NY Times magazine on Bethesda, MD a local suburb. I thought the article was great and Brooks by writing for the NYT knows his audience is the group being profiled. The book takes this funny social commentary on America's meritocracy but awkwardly intersperses it with dry academic citations. Brooks never seems to decide if this is witty satire or a serious academic observation and it is a combination that doesn't always work."
2,Yawn...,"I bought the book because the reviews at the time were better. I've decided that I don't care about finishing the book at this point; I've been bored with the so-called 'humorous' analogies that I have heard many times before. The author isn't making any new, incredible observations, he's merely telling us what a short newspaper article has already told us.To sum it up, the book is great if you've never watched prime time television, have never seen a Starbucks, or don't understand what dot-coms are. Otherwise, pass it by."
3,Bobos in Ecotopia,"Brooks has done a valuable service in charting a socioeconomic phenomenon. However the Bobos are not representative of the Upper Class AS A WHOLE.There is a tremendous amount of conspicuous consumption in society as a whole. If the ""rich peasants in Vegas"" are a minority, then why is Las Vegas booming as much as ever. Also, the Bobo consumption pattern of ""refined rusticity"" is not much in evidence in Manhattan and Beverly Hills.The Bobo is a geographic phenomenon found primarily in Ecotopia{the Pacific Northwest and Vermont} and not much in evidence elsewhere."
3,A little too wordy,"I was initially a little concerned about the book because I'm not a fan of labeling (aka name-calling). This book does have some interesting perspectives on social change in the last 60 years. The points feel a little stretched out though. I think they could have been made more concisely. About midway though, the book has some humor in presenting it's ideas which I found very pleasant."
3,BOBO? MISSES THE POINT,"The author misses the point. He seems to think the society page of the NY times means something fundemental to our society. Perhaps at one time there were a few of the self absorbed who did matter to society as a whole, but most of those folks just don't.The real BoBos aren't Harvard MBAs. They are the techies who are starting changing the economy. Peter Druker has it right, it is the KNOWLEDGE WORKERS who are emerging as the dominant class. The author is too fixed on the people who count their money, write their contracts, and sit on their boards.The New New Thing, is a less flawed book, and shows a real BoBo, who never saw the inside of elite cirles as defined in this book...just changed our society and economy while becoming a billionare."
1,Andy Rooney in disguise,"This review of today's culture seems like a regurgitation of thoughts from two of my least favorite television personalities - Andy Rooney and P.J. O'Rourke. I could only get through about 250 pages of the author's commentary on today's retail demographics. While the author has certainly done his fair share of research, it doesn't help this dry and un-funny view of today's society. I would much rather be subjected to Andy Rooney's 2 minute diatribes on 60 Minutes for a lifetime than to have to read this book again"
4,Being Bobo is my Mojo,"What a great and decent book about myself. Well Done Brookie. However, being cool Bobo is not nerdy, as percieved by a previous reviewer. Bobe's can be of pre-wealthy families, but these days (Yuppies? Lol-Where you been that last two decades, sonny) the majority are RICH due to hard strong study,torturous hours and 'blooming' hard work. The lesson is to enjoy this book, it's fun and fluency will pull you right in; understand we all have different lives: It IS true about the buying 'rubbish' for the hell of it - showing off etc - then never using it, and dropping to a low after....but just imagine what life would be like for YOU if you were sooo rich, that one just didnt enjoy shopping anymore....see, THEN how would you feel! BTW-'Nerdy' is an 'envy' term...........go on, save your money, give it a go, I promise you, you'll enjoy it (but in my case, et al, you'll enjoy studying and working for it much much more. Case Closed)."
3,"Starts strong, ends weak","The first half of this book is very good. I went in thinking it would be something like Paul Fussell's Class, and this book sort of started out that way. There was some humor and some insight, but as I pressed on I felt that the book was losing its edge, losing its sense of humor. By the midpoint, the book was more about praising the Bobo's than actually saying anything about them. It seemed as though the author needed the book to be so many pages, and when he ran out of steam, he threw in some chapters that were lying around."
3,"Better than Ambien, and usually more interesting...","After succumbing to the hype and purchasing this book, it became a diversion that lasted the better part of a month. The book often served as a bedtime tranquilizer for me. I found Brooks' style of writing overly pedantic and at times downright dry, but always filled with razor sharp wit. As a self-annointed sufi for the educated elite, he takes it upon himself to bash all of my personal proclivities from nubby breads to utilitarian pleasure travel to exotic locales. My lingering question...What's so bad about using academic supremacy as currency in the new world order?A worthwhile read, but only if you have the patience to plow through overripe metaphors in search of clever gems of social commentary. Not unlike the Barney's warehouse sale."
1,Middlebrow Man,"A hodgepodge of middlebrow cliches that doesn't know whether it is social commentary or humor; mainly, his thesis is just plain wrong as one could discover by going to Franklin country which Brooks says lacks over $20 meals. I traveled there this past winter to visit some relatives. There one would discover that there are plenty of places to order meals that cost over $20. Strange that his books is filed under ""sociology."" It is more like humor but one of a condescending kind like Joe Queenan."
2,Rather boring and trite,"Book seemed rather boring and trite--the dust jacket pretty much explained everything. Main problem, you see, is satire without wit does not keep our interest for long. Couldn't finish it. . ."
4,"Witty, Intelligent Observations","A funny, and biting, look into how hippie-era bohemians have morphed their youthful, anti-establishment ideals into a new social framework as they have matured. With the onset of the information age, these Bobos have assumed power in business, politics, and religion, reconciling their lifestyle choices along the way.David Brooks, who ascribes himself to the Bobo class, delivers a book that is gratified with the accomplishments of Bobo culture, critical of its flaws, and hopeful for its future. While critics may point this out as an attempt play both sides of the issue, it is representative of the compromises made a Bobo individual.Avid readers are sure to self-identify with many of the observations in this book. Your head will nod along in agreement with the passages. At times you'll chuckle, while silently worrying about crass trivialities. But as you sort through the implications, you'll realize that Bobo culture is not too bad."
4,"Great book, good insights","Had light expectations when I first bought this book. It's one person's analysis on the history of Bohemian and bourgeois classes and how they have impacted/contrasted one another over time.Easy read, and some great insights. Recommended."
5,Laugh at Yourself,"""Bobos"" serves up astute social criticism with wit and charm.Brooks has a lot of important things to say about how life has changed in America in the last thirty years. (For instance, how the adoption of the SAT unleashed a powerful rise of a meritocracy class and an achievement obsessed culture.) But it is Brooks' masterful and hysterical prose that makes this book so worthwhile. His good-natured satire of new age materialism is particularly inspired. Chances are something in this book will hit close to home and make you laugh about your family, your friends, and yourself."
2,"Fluffy, with No Edge","This is a fluffy look at the behavior of an influential segment of wealthy people today. Very funny in parts, tedious in others. But social comment is best done at a distance, and Brooks seems too worried about what his Bobo friends and neighbors might think to finish what he started. The book trails off, as he descends into explaining why the Bobos are different (and better) than the generations of wealthy people that have preceeded them.I'd take Paul Fussell's ""Class"" any day over this."
1,overly-smug and precious,This book is half over-generalized sociology and half product placement advertising. Throughout the book Brooks tries to be both self-congradulatory and ironically/sarcastically distant. Burn your SUV. Vote for Nader.
2,The Meritocracy Won??,"If David Brooks, now resident Bush Apologist for the New York Times, is right that the Meritocracy defeated the Aristocracy, why is the ultimate ""legacy"" George W. Bush now President?The Neocons would like for you to believe that it's all now merit based, but the ultra rich keep getting richer, the inheritance tax is now gone, and House and Senate seats are passed down across generations. Yuppies may have more stuff these days, but real power these days is increasingly in the hands of the few.Interesting thesis, wrong conclusion."
3,Armchair Quarterback,"No, give ME the 6'4"" blond football player who also happens to have a 150 I.Q. and who won the state math competition in his junior year; he's got a full scholarship to State to study pre-med...and he likes to take me to Burger King, where the Whoppers and fries are as good as they get! To heck with the inevitable heart attack, where is the wunderkind? Oh, he validates you. A Bobo is just an anagram for ""BOOB"". Unfortunately, this book and the responses to it show that intellectual capacity combined with arrogance leads to astonishing stupidity.Lest we forget the least among us, 1% of the U.S. populace holds 50% of the wealth and anyone else who assumes they are part of some meritocracy is deluded. I wish the author had been less neutral and more vitriolic with his humor."
3,Fun to read... to a point.,"I saw myself in this book. I now see it everywhere. When driving through an intersection, how many people are NOT clutching cell phones, lattes, or both? I enjoyed the semi-satirical look at my friends and colleagues searching for greater meaning in a formulaic time; however, I found that each chapter droned on and on and on.I recommend reading the first section of each chapter until you get bored and moving on to the next topic. Maybe that's a sadder commentary on the reader than the book but a ""Cliff's Notes"" approach seems perfect for the bobo set of readers likely to be most amused by this book."
5,Highly Recommended!,"In the last 24 hours have you: 1) Drank a cup of Starbucks coffee? 2) Worn a pair of hiking boots that cost more than $100, or 3) Eaten any organically grown food? If so, chances are that you're a Bobo. The Bobos, or Bourgeois Bohemians, are the moneyed and cultured elites who comprise today's establishment. As they assume a dominant role in the business world, the Bobos are bringing with them the artistic flair, cultural irreverence and social awareness that they - or their parents - experienced in the 1960s. Author David Brooks is to be commended for identifying this group, and tagging it with an appropriately deprecating nickname. We from getAbstract highly recommend this engaging, insightful - and let's face it- kind of embarrassing analysis of today's upper class."
2,Cultural Insights of the Lowest Order,"We don't need any more information that shows that we live in a puerile culture, a land where teen mentality dominates, where most adults are lulled by the omnipresent media into ""arrested development"" as we say in Psychiatry. David Brooks' ""Bobos in Paradise"" is a thinly veiled continuation of this trend, only his paradigm is sociology, and of the most superficial variety. In my opinion, there are plenty of true bohemians out there who are in no way middle-class, and vice versa. Where the two (Bo and Bo) overlap, it is only in the most surface ways, which is what this book is all about: surfaces. superficialities. I don't recommend this for anyone who craves depth-in-reading."
3,Not as funny as the sample pages,"I ordered this book because I read the sample pages online and they were both interesting and entertaining. I was a bit disappointed once I ordered the actual book. The beginning chapters were very good and met the expectations I had, but towards the end the book tended to drone on and become quite boring. I even ended up skipping pages because I just couldn't get motivated to finish. The author explains that he orginally started out writing short stories on this subject. I think this information could have stayed funny and interesting in a short story or article form, but the book was just too much. All and all I would still recommed it if you can borrow it from someone or get it from the library, but I wouldn't spend money on it."
1,Read the dust cover and save time.,"After seeing the author, David Brooks, on PBS's The News Hour, and Life and Times, I got the impression that Bobo's would be more comedy than social commentary. Wrong. The minimal humor in this book can be gleaned by reading the dust cover. Sociologists may like it, but don't buy it for the humor alone."
5,Funny Insights Makes a Great Gift,"David Brooks hits his target -- and often -- in this insightful, often very funny book. His description of today's educated elite is dead-on, capturing our need to reconcile historical extremes into a comforting, soft-edged world. Through deft observation, Brooks manages to place an entire generation into perspective.This is a great book to give to a Baby Boomer, Starbuck's addicted friend. Especially if your friend is in marketing, advertising, politics, sales or owns a business. The insights into today's most active customers will more than justify the cost of the book. Plus, as an added bonus, the book, which is apolitical, helps explain how a George W. Bush could be elected President."
1,I hated it.,"Parts of this book made me so mad that I shamelessly flung it at my walls. It seems to me that the author thinks that Bobos are adorable with their ability to spend small fortunes on absolutely nothing while pretending they have an ethos because they aren't like the marriage page of the NY Times in the 50s. If you are a baby boomer, please don't read this book, realize that you are in tune with the world, and then quietly lull yourself with an organic parka or whatever nonsense it is ok to spend thousands of dollars on in the Bobo world. Read Daniel Quinn. Read Paul Hawken."
3,Brooks has his classes mixed up,"David Brooks, I believe, wrongly characterizes Bobo's as the new upper class. However, every description he gives of Bobo's screams Upper Middle Class. As much as he would like to think that the Old Money WASP society has faded away, that is just not the case, and he gives no hard evidence to back up his arguments. He is too involved and entrenched in Bobo-ism himself to gain a proper and accurate perspective. I'm not defending the values or beliefs of Old Money or WASP society, but to say that they have been replaced by Bobo's is ridiculous. Bobo's may characterize a portion of the American Upper Class (if, by ""class"" we're talking strictly economic values), but they are by no means the definition of today's Upper class. I think Brooks likes Bobo's, and he likes being one, which leads him to (wrongly) believe they have taken over. Anyway, there is some funny stuff in this book, and is entertaining, despite its inaccuracy."
3,Bobos in Paradise - or Paris?,"When I read this book, I chuckled - after all, I live in San Francisco. But at the same time, there was a little bell going off in the back of my mind - hadn't I read something similar awhile back? As it happened, the book in question had just been reprinted. Jerrold Siegel's ""Bohemian Paris"" centers on the relationship between the bourgeois and the bohemian in mid-nineteenth century Paris. He discusses the popularity of ""revolutionary"" works of art among the middle classes, and the way that this reception changed both the meaning of the work and the artists' own view of their society. Siegel sees this cooption as being central to capitalism and its own intrinsic defense against violent revolution.Has Brooks ever read Siegel? Possibly not - maybe he's just a keen observer of similar social dynamics. Nevertheless, anyone who takes ""Bobos"" seriously will want to add ""Bohemian Paris"" to their shopping cart."
3,The X Way Out,"Paul Fussell seems to have predicted the rise of the Bobo in his book Class (see the final chapter, ""The X Way Out""). Fussell's one chapter description of this type of creature is wittier and more on-target than Brooks' entire book."
4,A self-portrait that bites,"This witty book-- challenging in its compilation of observations about our daily lives, shallow in that it ignores so much of modern America -- frequently made me cringe. I easily recognized myself (late forties, African American, PhD, Oberlin... you get the idea) in every chapter and loved the way the author crafted the language to present a portrait at once incisive, critical, but affectionate. We Baby Boomers have much to be grateful for, much to be held accountable for, but nothing to apologize for. In every latte-laced chapter, Brooks probes more deftly into turn-of-the-century U.S. culture and mores and does not take a wrong turn. This is an easy read, an adventurous excercise, and a sparklingly clear mirror held up to our generation."
4,An engaging social commentary,"David Brooks' ""Bobos in Paradise"" paints an accurate picture of today's upper class. His analysis of the New York Times wedding announcements, found early in the book, pretty much describes the entire ""Bobo"" phenomenon. Indeed, it is a phenomenon worthy of examination. That the bohemian and bourgeois cultures have merged is clearly evident in modern America. The days of the preppy bourgeois remain only in Polo/Ralph Lauren advertisements, while any bohemian unwilling to accept the fruits of capitalism and gain no longer exists.Brooks does repeat himself often, and he does get bogged down in his examination of the origins of modern intellectualism. Though the subject matter represents merely a fraction of today's America, the book is very much worth reading as an engaging social commentary. Accordingly, Brooks deserves praise for his efforts to explain the ""Bobos."""
2,"Like it or not, it is accurate","Whether or not you enjoy this book will be highly dependent on your perspective.I believe Mr. Brooks wrote the book in order to chronicle the lives, views, and desires of a generation that has grown into a mature facet of our society. If you look at this book from that vantage, it is an accurate (if somewhat preachy and obsequious) description of the ""Bobo.""Mr. Brooks does not manage to do much more than paint the picture, but he has done so in a realistic manner. Interpretation of the picture (and judgement of the society he paints) is left to the reader."
3,Very Difficult but Short,"If you have played the previous games , It is too short compared to the Commandos 2 but very very difficult. The last stages in all three parts are almost impossible. TIP: quick save as often as you can."
5,Commandos 3,Great improvement from the first two. Much harder. Loved 1 and 2. Completed both. Commandos 3 is taking a lot more concentration. Love this game.
1,not even worth one star!!!,"Too bad, the graphics, I see more squares, missions are designed like cheating customers,ie, too simple, too few, they are ruining the good name of commando series, STOP THIS CRIME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Recommended,"I read all the reviews, and after playing this game I can't be more agreed. This game is absolutely not recommended and a big turn down to all commandos fans everywhere."
2,Disappointment Plus,"After thoroughly enjoying Commandos 2, I looked forward with great anticipation to Commandos 3 only to be greatly disappointed. The characters and graphics are basically the same but the actual play is quite different.There are no varying levels of play so it seems everyone is playing at expert level which can make the game for average gamers very difficult and frustrating. The actual keyboard selections for actions seem more complicated and the loss of time in selecting the proper action often results in the gamer getting killed off and the game having to be re-loaded adding to one's frustration. The only positive I see in this game is any satisfaction the gamer might get in completing a mission. They all seem too difficult for the average gamer of which I am. The cost of the game is higher than the satisfaction received. I could not recommend it."
1,Pure trash,"Avoid at all costs. This game is pure trash, it has none of great story, diverse characters and involved thinking that put Commandos 1 & 2 among the best strategy games ever written. C3 has better graphics, equal music and NOTHING else. Controls are bad - the lack of weapon shortcuts make this game almost unplayable. There are no cutscenes between missions and most missions play out in a few locations. Gone are all the nice details from C2, like furniture items; you cannot hide in cupboards and you cannot hide bodies anymore.Pyro would have done a better job had they just made some new maps for C2 and released that instead of this cr*p."
5,Tito Nieves does it again!,"Once again ""El Gordito de Oro"" comes through with some great music. This CD is a must for all Tito Nieves fans."
5,Superstar Shortstops,"Professionally produced, high-energy video for the baseball fan and player. Exceptional highlights of fantastic defensive plays from baseball's best shortstops. A must for anyone who plays the position as well as a true fan who enjoys being entertained by these All Star players doing the unbelievable."
4,Great Band - Good Album (3),"If you enjoy good generic-melodic hard rock, then I recommend the band Gun and this album. Rocks hard enough to be enjoyable (with good melodies and vocals that you can understand - 4 out of 5 stars)."
3,Disappointing,"I had heard great things about this album, but it's not as strong as I had hoped. Oh well...can't all be winners, can they?"
3,Spartacus by Howard Fast,"A good look into the time period and the brutal use of slaves, I simply didn't care much for Fast's writing style, and use of very little dialogue. But the original movie with Kirk Douglas was very true to the book."
3,Doesn't feel familiar as Joanne's music usually does.,"I have probably been one of Joanne's most admiring fans since I first heard her sing one of her songs. Everytime I hear one of the many I have it's as if the music center in my brain and entire body responds with an ""I'mhome"" type of feeling. This CD just didn't draw out any of the usual deep spiritual and calming in my spiritthat all the others have.No disrespect meant to Joanne, it is just one person's response."
2,General Advices About Public Speech,"The book is about how you should prepare to public speech. It talks about how to setup a stage, how to work with a michrophone, how to walk in a stage and the known advices as 'know your audience' and 'rehearse'.I think this might be good reading if you lack any clue about the process but for people that need to improve their presentation skills it's not worth. Also there's almost nothing on tips for preparing slides (the most common media, I think).The author keeps giving infinite acronyms where she wants to work on topics (almost all topic groups gets its own) and it's really annoying."
5,Where You Want To Go For One-Stop Presentation Skills,"I've known Diane DiResta's work for many years. She is the ""Queen of Presentations"". Her book provides a no-nonsense approach to the art of clear, precise and meaningful communications to audiences large and small. I've taught Presentation Skills courses myself for over 25 years in the corporate world and I refer to her works in almost a ""biblical"" sense. She knows what she's saying. She's been there, she's done that! Great primer."
5,A Must Read For Speakers Of All Kinds,"Knockout Presentations is a brilliant, confidence-building and reassuring book.When I am preparing a presentation I want simple guidelines and comprehensive information. I am a Professional Speaker and have used this book to prepare keynote presentations, and I love how straightforward the steps are to creating a presentation that has real impact and clarity.I love it when a book breaks down the steps to take and takes you through piece by piece and that is exactly what Knockout Presentations does. If you are after a lot of detail, that is there too - wow has Diane Di Resta spent time making this the go to book in its genre.This is a book I go back and refer to at different times for different purposes - a real reference book.If there were 6 stars on Amazon that's what I would be selecting!!"
5,A practical and useful book,"Another reviewer said it is not often that a book lives up to its title: especially with words like 'power' and 'pizzaz' as part of the promise. This book certainly did for me. It is not full of jargon. It is not full of pictures and distraction. What it does have it clear ideas, simply given that you can immediately put into practise.The book covers basics like dealing with nerves as well as advanced issues like presenting with an interpreter. This makes it a great choice for all levels of presenter.A great addition to anyone's library for a small dollar purchase."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book, it told us about how Kelly Slater got to where he is today and it had a lot of information on heats and different contests around the world, that Kelly won and lost. My girlfriend would have liked a bit more personal information though as she bought the book purely because she thinks he is gorgeous."
3,Gets dull,"This book is ok. It starts out really well, but it starts to die out after a while. The problem is that he goes on about each world championship title, and each one isn't that much different from the last. I would agree with Jacks that this book ""Reads like a chronology of wins."" If this book were 20 pages shorter, it might be better."
3,A Surfer's kind of Autobio,"This book is a great insight into the champion surfer, Kelly Slater. As a surfer myself, I found the book compelling and interesting, but I don't think that the writing is particularly good. The narrative focuses on his personal life and seems to struggle to synthesize the various chronological phases of his life.If you're interested in the life of Kelly Slater outside of what he does on the WCT then this is definitely a great book to look into. However, if you plan on picking up a well-written book, and you're really not interested in the particular subject of surfing, it might not be what you're looking for."
2,Pipe dreams: a basic story,"Hi, all,Kelly Slater has been my hero for a long time. Because I thought he was smarter, more humble, more ""earth-concious"" than most pro surfers. We all know he's the most winning. Perhaps I had him hyped up, but the book was a bit of a disappointment. It is also dated at this point with his now having won 10 world titles. (at the time of the book he had won 6.)But now I know what's in kelly's brain. kinda cool. But i guess I thought there was more in there.The writing is fairly poor but readable.All that said, I couldn't really put it down, and it was one of those books that would put me to sleep, but rather, kept me up.Jesse"
4,"Good, but where is the emotion?","As a novice surfer, and an obsessive one, I am in awe of people like Kelly Slater, and only wish I had grown up close to waves so maybe I could be a quarter of what he has become.This book was really easy and interesting to read, and the only problem I have with it is that he didn't really touch on how surfing FELT.I wanted to know...how did it feel, the first time he caught a wave? What is it really like to ride places like Pipe for the first time, or any time, other than scary? What is it like to be inside a barrel...etc etc.I learned a lot about his competitive nature and his triumphs and shortcomings. The great parts of this book is when he is sharing feelings, not ratings."
3,Obsessed with surfing,"I have been a fan of Kelly's since my college roommate from San Diego put a poster of him on her wall in 1991. Since then I have tried to follow his career in whatever way I could. Reading this book I realized that I had such a small and superficial view of him as that cute surfer who, by the way, is also a wold champion. However, now I see not only how he has struggled in and out of the water but how much he has impacted the sport of surfing and helped shape it for the future. I also love the way he talks about his friendships. It is written in such a conversational manner that you almost forget that you are reading a book. Reganbooks has scored another winner in ""Pipe Dreams"". I am a librarian in NYC now and I want to go out and hand this to kids and tell them to read it."
3,Pazzy,"Originally I thought of Kelly Slater as the thought as the ""quiet genius"" type from seeing and hearing him in surf movies.It is good to hear about his thoughts, but he seems, sometimes,quiet shallow, insecure and almost juvenile. It is shame how easily he dismisses his friendships,family (especially his daughter!)and relationships because of competition and fame.It doesnt sound like he has ever has a real relationship in his life. (I read Occys book and he is the similar but much morechildish)Why would a guy with all the talent in the world get so hung up on a media puppet like Pamela Anderson (besides the obvious endowments)All in all still a great story of the greatest surfer ever, he just needs to grow up."
3,Limited perspective,"""Having Babies"" is well-written and I found the articulated writing style helpful with making the characters true-to-life and keeping the chapters interesting. However, as far as looking to this book as a source of information....well, just be sure to check out many other sources as well. The information is presented somewhat in depth but I am very wary of the one-dimensional aspect of the ""factual"" parts of the book which are presented as ultimate truth. For one thing (among many others), the side effects (physiological and consequential) of various pain meds during labor are not even given lip-service, let alone well-examined.Again, utilizing many other sources of information will make this book a more valuable read than just reading it alone."
5,Fresh Thinking/Practical Focus.,"The format and presentation make it an easy,entertaining read. However, there is some great insight that can be harvested and used in a very practical way. It provides a clear understanding of the drivers behind some of the typical behaviors we see every day. It's a huge advantage to be able to understand and anticipate how groups interact.I would recommend it to anyone in the IT trenches."
2,Practice Makes Perfect,"I love Janet Mullany's later irreverent Regency romps, so I thought I'd take a look at her earlier work.""Dedication"" is decidedly an earlier effort--when Mullany had not yet hit her stride.The plot and characters often make little sense. The characters are two-dimensional and the dialogue lacks the snap and fizz of later works.There are nuggets of humor and irony to be mined here and there, showing promise of what will come in subsequent books, but on the whole the story is tedious and unconvincing.The plot device of heading each chapter with excerpts from imitations of lurid gothic novels as a way to preface to the melodrama contained in the the next chapter is the one fun aspect of the book.Save your money for her later works."
5,Is it hot in here?,"I've never read a Regency that's so sexy! Readers who insist onchastity in their Regency characters might want to stay away.But readers who are fine with believing that a twice-widowedwoman of 37, and a widower of 42 or so, might know a thingor two from their experiences not be quite as fuddy duddy astheir children assume, will have a fun read here. There are alot of interesting historical details, too, and new twists onclassic plots. Definitely recommended."
4,loved it....,"great, fast read! This is a wonderful contemporary regency-by that I mean if you are looking for the traditional, mild regency story-this is NOT it. What it is is a sensual, mature love story with wonderful subplots, a realistically flawed hero and heroine, and super spicy love scenes that are sexy as well as downright funny at times. Glad to have read this great new author after recently reading a series of duds.Highly recommended for the non traditional regency fan.4.5 stars!"
2,I might be able to learn to use this pan -- but the waste of time and materials !,"I could not agree more with Jerry i h. I had failure one last weekend with sticky buns -- burned on bottom, hard and dry -- even though I know this recipe blind-folded. The birds got a treat. This weekend I reduced the oven temperature by 25 degrees and placed the rack in the middle of the oven to make ginger bread. I watched, smelled, and took the ginger bread out way early. Still slightly burned on the bottom. It's going to be edible -- but not perfect.I would like to make this product work -- it was a gift - and I got many pieces, but I'm not sure I want to waste eggs, butter and flour to bake for the birds."
3,Disapointed...,"I had very high expectations from this movie. First its the reason why I signed up to amazon, couldnt find Swordsman I anywhere after falling in love with Swordsman II. Plus Iv'read all the feedback in here and people are saying things like ""action every 15 minutes"" hmmm... maybe quantity is good, but quality is much better. Anyway, not enough swordsfight, and when one happens its too short.Like another viewer says, this movie helps u understand SwordsmanII better, might be the only valuable reason to see it.. and i miss jet Li :("
5,This is how all albums should be.,"I am a huge fan of the Texas rap scene. I love all these guys, they are a lot more talented than most other mainstream rappers these days. People who don't listen to rap don't understand the power of this album. I'm tired of people saying how ""un-original"" this kind of music this is. Go listen to the beatles then. This is rap."
2,Dissapointing,"Dissapointing is the best word I found to rate this book. I think the topic is of great interest and the credentials of the author are quite good but (and is a big but) it doesn't matter at all since the writting style, and overall skills to transmit the main ideas and conclusions are poor, very complex and in my opinion stock between a book aimed for people with strong technical background and normal readers with special interest in these topics."
1,Don't take a chance with your time on this book,"The title is aptly chosen. Time and chance. You'll loose out of both on this book. Try the book The Direction of Time. It is a much better written book. It is amazing that Alberts actually earned his degree in anything. The man simply cannot write worth a damn, try as hard as he does to convey what often are simple concepts."
1,I disagree with this author,"He uses common assumptions which I believe are wrong. For example he assumes that all arrangement of atoms in a gas have equal probabliity. It should be obvious that probability of an atom being in a small section of its path is inversely proportional to its velocity in that portion of the path. He describes the Maxwell demon and he is correct there but there is a second deamon analogous to the Maxwell demon. For example thee is a definite probability that all molecules of a gas in a specific volume can spontaneously be within a smaller volume. However, because the velocity of the molecules is so high the duration of the molecules is so small that it is not evident in the pressure on the walls. For a further discussion on this subject see my book ""The Thermodynamics of Rheology"" Chapter IV."
2,"Uh, no!","This book is a mostly ""tongue in cheek"" look at the world of cannibalism for survival. While it is darkly humorous, It's rough and raw and covers topics like ""Does it taste like chicken?, What will my friends think? etc...Shiguro also takes a look at cases where cannibalism actually occured, such as the ill-fated Donner party, the stranded Uruguayan rugby team and several other case histories.While meant totally as a humorous book, it has some serious undertones."
2,All tongue in cheek,"This book is a mostly ""tongue in cheek"" look at the world of cannibalism for survival. While it is darkly humorous, It's rough and raw and covers topics like ""Does it taste like chicken?, What will my friends think? etc...Shiguro also takes a look at cases where cannibalism actually occured, such as the ill-fated Donner party, the stranded Uruguayan rugby team and several other case histories.While meant totally as a humorous book, it has some serious undertones."
1,Don't Eat Me...wait...,"The author obviously experienced severe trauma as a child, because this is one of the most disturbing subjects I have ever had the misfortune to read."
4,A great coffee table book!,"If you can tolerate the funny looks from the girl at the cash regester, you will be in for a treat. The book was filled with interesting facts and funny stories. It is also great to have out by the couch when guests come over! It's only flaw was that it was a little vague about how to actually prepare ""the meat"". I'm not sure if I could actually do it properly if the ""need arose"". Until then that jerk next-door is safe..."
4,Tasty little book!,"Okay, let me get the puns out of the way. This is a ""tongue in cheek"" book in which the author ""eats his heart out"" about a taboo topic, yet still gets to the ""meat"" of the matter. The gallows humor can be annoying at times, and can be a matter of ""taste"" (all right, I'll stop), but it does deal with something that we'd rather not think about (yet may have to deal with in a worst-case scenario). I'm certain that the author had very good intentions in writing this book...but I can just imagine the jokes he must get (""Hey Shiguro, gonna barbeque this weekend?"")"
2,Obstructive,"I bought this case for my roommate because he has this super expensive phone and always carries it around in his pocket, thus it was incurring scratches and damage rather regularly. The case itself is nice, has a tight fit and does not make the phone much bulkier (unless you have the belt clip attached), but it has plastic covering all the keypad buttons except 4 or 5 of the big ones, which is the main problem because it makes typing on it harder than it already is, which is quite a problem for owners of this phone because its already semi-difficult to use the tiny little keyboard. He had this on his phone for about 3 days and since then I've never seen it on there, I recommended he cut off the plastic so he can access the keys easier, hopefully that helps."
1,dont buy it,I have had the phone for less then one year and have had to get two replacements. The last time it took Palm One 3 weeks to get me my new replace. Think about this I paid $500.00 for a phone and for almost one month I could not use it. The reception is very poor. I would shop around for a different phone.Signed with out a phone
3,speaker breaks,"Worked perfectly for 4 months. Excellent device. Suddenly the speaker broke. The signal strenght has been getting lower and lower, and now looses signal."
1,Worst phone ever!,"I bought my Treo about 2 months ago and have had to replace it twice. Same problem both times. I can't answer calls because it goes straight to voice mail, the key pad does not work when checking messages and no matter where I am, it says I don't have service even though I do. My first Treo just died on me and now the second one is having the same issues. Don't buy this phone since many other people I've talked to have had the same problems I have!"
3,This is not your Nokia 5660,"A reminder in general to combo-pda users -- the screen is fragile glass, and not designed to take standard cell phone abuse. My Treo 600 screen cracked inexplicably within the month, alas, not a covered warranty item. $150 gets you a new screen, and sense of suspense. Other than that, it's great piece of technology."
3,To add on to my earlier review,"Not only is the manual useless, so is the website. Phone support for this product is only free for the first 90 days, and subsequently becomes about $20 per ""incident."" At this point, I have been on hold for over half an hour and it is nowhere near a peak calling time (Friday evening). I may be returning this soon."
1,Question,"I have a question about the treo. If I currently have an AT&T Wireless plan, and I buy this phone from a friend or someone other than AT&T, will I be able to get a plan for it with AT&T? Does the treo I buy have to be locked or unlocked to use with my current provider? (AT&T Wireless) I know nothing about these kind of things so any info would be cool. thanks!"
2,dont buy it if you want to use the advanced functions,"OK, so now I get some guy on their support line that tells me that the Treo 600 cannot open or handle .jpgs and that I can pay for 3rd party software. While I'm talking to the guy, I find this on handspring's website:""The version of the Palm OS your Treo 600 smartphone runs can handle the following kinds of attachments fresh out of the box:Polyphonic ringtones (.mid)JPEG image files (.jpg)vCard and vCal files (.vcs and .vcf)""Who is right? I don't know. But clearly one of them is wrong, and they're both Handspring. I'm pretty pissed off. It clearly can't handle .jpgs right out of the box, and they clearly can't handle giving any explanation of the more advanced functions that the Treo may or may not have.DONT BUY ONE IF YOU WANT MORE THAN A PHONE, PDA AND GODAWFUL BROWSER."
1,defective treo 600 phone - a common problem???,"I had the following problem. The sound starts getting bad after less than a month of use and then sound drops out totally from internal ear speaker. According to the wireless store, this is a common problem. I wish I had done an internet search before buying the phone.Customer service from Palm is slow and very difficult to get. They insist on providing me with a refurbished phone, even though mine is only a little more than a month old. ATT says they are not responsible after 1 month.The palm software, as expected, works great . But we need the phone to work too."
2,CreepNoMore is a bust!!,Just does not deliver. Pedal still creeps away you have to be conscious of how you are stepping on the pedal. Wrong angle and it moves away. Too bad.
5,Revolution......a musical one,"These guys take their music to the next level with this album. San Isabella was the first single and it is hauting with a man's search for their soulmate.From the rock of ""College Days"" to the country of ""Amarillo Windmill"" to the Gospel of "" Mr. Devil"" this album is great. Do not forget to play the ghost track after ""Mr. Devil""... a little ditty called ""Rear View Mirror"" It is a great suprise at the end of an excellent album....I love J.J.'s drums & Mike McClure's vocals. Once again McClure has wrote some great songs, with quotes from Edgar A. Poe and lines about college parties & parties out by the old farm pond.This album should of put The Divide on the map and a major draw with the music buying public, it is so much better than alot of stuff on the top of charts."
3,"This aluminum wire may stretch, this steel wire won't:","I bought this wire for general household use because it is easily flexible, yet holds it's shape.I haven't tried it for a clothesline, but according to several posts; aluminum wire stretches.This similar wirehttp://www.amazon.com/Hillman-Plastic-Coated-Wire-Clothesline/dp/B000BQM6QY/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0Made of steel, probably won't stretch, or if it does, you won't notice it..it's only 50 feet, but almost half the money.."
2,Stretches Too Much,"Like another reviewer, my mother always used plastic-coated wire clothesline, so it was my choice when I recently put up clothesline poles. We have had to repeatedly retie it and even added turnbuckles to make tightening easier after the wire stretches after each use. Wire will stretch. We will replace this wire with braided wire."
2,Too dim and too small,"Even at the highest light setting, this is still way too dim. And with 5 1/4"" diameter mirror, this is just way too small. Not to mention that every time you touch it to move it or adjust it, it activates the ""touch"" controls and turns the light off. I'm returning this immediately."
3,What a mess!!,"I have the set mentioned here. As a fan of the Transformers I was rather anxious to watch them. I was rather disappointed at the misleading title of the box set. It says its a three pack Vol. 1 VHS (and you therefore expect it to be the first three tapes of season 1), not the case however. They are three random tapes of various episodes and seperate seasons. To someone who's new to Transformers this would confuse the living daylights out of them. Personally I hate it when this sort of thing happens and can only imagine that someone was trying to make alot of money with very little thought as to the way they market their product. If you are a fan of the Transformers and watch often than this would be a good investment. If however you are new to Transformers this will only prove to be a disappointment."
3,The good the bad and the ugly (iron hides figure),"Not every arrow you shoot gets a bull. This is the proof of the fact. of the 6 episodes in this pack only 3 are worth buying. Dark Awakeing, Starscreams brigade, and The search for alpha trion. The others are pure quinteson. It aslo seams to be the case with other packs. whatch out for volume 7-9 as there is only going to be one good episode (return of optimus prime). also if you ever get the chance get the revenge of bruitics as its the second part of starscreams brigade."
3,What happened to continuity?,"Maybe it is just me, but it seems this box set contains mostlypoorer episodes from the series. It's nice to see the series againand all, but I find this box set to be lacking in another very important area. The episodes are all completely out of order. There is no sense of continuity in this particular set of tapes. Rhino coulb have done a much better job in my oppinion. I would recommend this series only to the most die hard fans. Anyone else may be confused by being thrown right into the middle of the series with no explanations. Personally I would have liked to see the origin of the transformers and the beginning of the series before being shot into episodes from after the movie or from the second season of the television show."
1,Worst pan in my kitchen,"Received this as a Christmas present on my wish list. After using it four times on low heats, there are pits on the surface, and the finish is turning a bronzy color. Far from ""professional"", I wouldn't recommend this for any level chef! Now I have to decide if the cost of returning to Amazon is worth the postage from Canada!"
4,white bathing suit,"This movie came out when I was young and first saw it at a free show. At the time it was a very revealing, provocitive movie, as some might say beauty and the beast attraction. If the movie was made or remade today the lady would have to be swimming nude to get the same effect. But all and all it still holds its appeal to movie buffs of the monster fans For a low budget film it is made well. The setting of the movie reminds me of a possible tarzan location. All in all in my opinion for a half century old movie it was very well made."
5,Good old movie,"Saw this movie when I was younger so had to get it. Love watching old movies like these, want to get more."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY,"We were very satisfied with the movie, at first we had trouble setting up the movie coming from another country...I explained my concern and the seller immediate resolved out issue and we were able to view the movie. THANK YOU SO MUCH."
1,Creature from the black lagoon,This is one of my all time favorite but it wouldn't let me view it something about it won't play in my region. That it only plays in region 2 and 4. I would like a refund.
1,Region 2? Now I Know!,"PLEASE PLACE THE EXPLANATION THAT YOU ARE SELLING A VIDEO THAT I CANNOT VIEW HIGHER IN THE AD!!!!! Before this experience I could not have told you that America was in ""Region 1"", since this has never happened to me before. I was able to alter the format so that it will play on my computer, and can now view the movie while seated at my desk in an upright chair. Hardly an ideal solution for me. I now know to be more cautious when ordering videos from Amazon!"
3,crowtrobot,"Well, it wasn't as advertised which is probably exactly why it's so cheap. However it is a unique cover featuring the movies official or second poster. But the back seems as if the storyline was just typed up before sent. I guess I just expected something else. Oh and the menus are boring with no special features on any of the three dvd's I ordered, so probably none on any other of his movies. But the movie plays and I guess thats all you can ask for. Thanks, I guess."
4,Last of the Classic Monsters.,"The rest of the group being King Kong, Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy, and the Wolfman. I'd rate this at 4 1/2 stars if I could, just a notch below the others, mostly because it presents essentially a take on King Kong rather than an entirely new theme. In other respects, especially the great atmospheric cinematography, it's right up there. Note to fans of Julie Adams: her best other movie is the very good 1952 Jimmy Stewart Western ""Bend of the River"". (Yes, she looks great not swimming too.)"
4,Found an old classic,It's usually very hard to find old classic black and white movies so this was a good find. Reasonable price and had it in a few days. The person that requested it for Christmas will be very happy.
5,creature from the black lagoon,The DVD was received on time and it was in very good conditions. There were no scratches or problems with the DVD
5,Julia Adams as the Beauty.,"The Creature has a good reason for wanting Julia Adams for his own! She wears this hot bikini thoughout most of the movie, revealing much of her legs and figure. A dicription of her throughout the movie would be, Long black beautiful hair, small tight frilly bikini revealing her breast figure, most of back is naked , and so are shoulders. The bathing suit comes up short on her hips revealing both legs. Barefoot throughout the whole movie. You might say half naked! If you are looking for a movie with true American beauty, watch Julia Adams in {The Creature From the Black Lagoon}"
1,Creature from the Black Lagoon,"When I ordered, it did not say that DVD could not BE PLAYED on players in the USA...so I am returning..."
4,Good,"In comparison to the 1931 version of Dracula, this movie is significantly better - amazing how much more developed movies were in 1954...did bigger reels have anything to do with it? The acting is far more credible although I see that both movies end abruptly as soon as the fiend is dead...what gives?! I can see why the creature keeps chasing after Julie Adams...not a bad decision on his part - she must have been at the apex of her career :)"
5,the creature,oh what can i say it was for my mom who first saw this monster for the first time and it was a birthday present for her and she loved it more than words can ever say. i also loved it to myself cause i just love all of those old monster movies cause the ones out there now are just not the same so bravo to you all and once again i so thank you soo much for all you do thank you.
4,Creature kept afloat by sound premise,"The Creature from the Black Lagoon is your basic Saturday morning cartoon stuff, but it is slickly produced to make it one of the prototypes for 1950's monster movies. A biological expedition heads to the nearly forgotten backwaters of the Amazon in search of a mythical half-man, half-lizard creature. The underwater photography in this movie is stunningly lucid (and plays better in black and white than some of the color underwater stuff shot today). Julie Adams's swimming is equally lucid and graceful. Rico Brown (a professional swimmer himself) plays The Creature and is mezmorizing in his underwater fight scenes. Aside from the Adams & Brown synchronized swimming, the other actors leave much to be desired. But the premise and the emphasis on storytelling (not unrelenting violence) is sound enough to keep Creature afloat."
3,A Killer Within,"A Killer Within is a decent murder mystery. This indie flick isn't the next Million Dollar Baby, but it will keep you entertained for about an hour and half.The plot is well written and there's a good ensemble cast (C. Thomas Howell, Sean Young and Giancarlo Esposito). The basic premise is that Addison (Howell) is a big-shot lawyer, who comes home one night to find that his wife Becky (Young) has been murdered and his young son is unconscious and badly injured. With the help of his business partner and an ex-cop, Addison goes on a search to find the real killer.Ben Browder's performance as Addison's business partner is also worth mentioning. Sci-fi buffs will probably recognize Browder from Stargate SG-1 and Farscape.If you're into murder mysteries, it's definitely worth taking a look at."
4,Big Fun,"This is a lawyer's movie. I found it interesting since I have lawyer friends and they are close to the vest but still have emotions not easily displayed. I loved Giancarlo Esposito and C. Thomas Howell. The other actors were all A, but those two were A+. The Dallas Morning News said that the budget was small so if this kinda work can come from a small budget why does Hollywood produce ""tankers"" with no hope with huge budgets????. I think this a movie worth watching if you think."
1,A waste of time,There is nothing about the characters in this movie that makes you like them enough to even care what happens. The outcome is predictable and the acting in this film is pathetic. The music is overdramatic and overbearing. Please save your time and money and watch something else instead.
1,Not as advertised,"This device will enable you to hear various swooshing sounds from inside the womb, but it is nearly impossible to distinguish what the sounds are. This is definitely NOT the device to buy if you want to hear your baby's heartbeat -- I am well into the third trimester and couldn't hear anything resembling a heartbeat. I wouldn't mind so much if the product weren't advertised as being something that would let you hear the heart, but it's totally misleading. Not worth the money."
1,Piece of crap.,"My husband and I bought this when we were about 6 weeks along, knowing fully well that it wouldn't work until the third trimester (but being our first child, we figured we'd give it a shot anyway... we were excited, you know how it is).I'm now 37 weeks and never have I heard anything from it that wasn't gas or my hand moving. It's a great idea in concept, but very poor execution. Don't waste your money."
1,Waste of money - doesn't work,This doesn't work. I couldn't hear anything except the sound of the foam on the headset each time I moved the sensor on my belly. DON'T buy this. I tried it my 2nd semester and intermittently up to my due date. Nothing - and I knew my baby was in there with a strong heartbeat! I would give this zero stars if I could.
5,a visual delight,I loved everything about this movie with one exception...why was it never released in letter-box format? The spectacular visual effects are somehow lost on the video because so much has been cut off. I am hoping to see it released soon on DVD.
5,"Where are thou, DVD?","Roger Ebert, in one of his most sensible comments, said this film stands outside of criticism, and that's certainly true. It's just a delight, everytime I see it and hear the words ""Bosun! Bosun!"" I crack a big grin and settle in for one of the most unusual films ever made.So, after all these years, and with thousands and thousands of DVD's issued for obscure and worthless crappy movies, where in the heck is the DVD for this, a landmark film that would obviously benefit from the treatment? There must be something going on behind the scenes that is preventing it."
2,Great movie; not a great DVD,"I purchased this from ''classics_vhs_dvd"" and am rather disappointed at the image quality; the data is highly compressed (only 3.1GB for the whole movie!) and there are visible compression artifacts and audio hiss; no chapter markings, menus, or subtitles. A real shame for such a visually detailed film!It looks very much like a ripped copy burned onto a DVD-R, though the seller claims this is how it was originally released. (Which seems likely to be true; I see a lot of complaints online about the quality of various DVDs produced by Allied Artists Classics.)It's better than nothing, and no higher-quality version seems likely to come along any time soon... but it's sure not what I was hoping for."
2,"a total ripoff of Shakepeare's ""The Tempest""!","Seriously, though, this movie is uneven. The daring and unconventional visuals of the first half -- incredibly -- give way to a stilted, boring second half. Greenaway might have been able to pull this off for 15 minutes, but it groans at 120 minutes."
2,Don't call this Shakespeare,"This movie should be called ""Gielgud in Love..."" with his own voice. It's an interesting experiment, and an interesting idea, but it is so narcissistic and indulgent. Prospero's Books lacks all of the passion of the Tempest, sells it short by falling in love with an admittedly great Shakespearean actor saying all of the lines in a beauitful if somewhat detached way. Please, save your money and rent it if you must, but preferrably go see a live production!"
2,Blu-Ray US Release Needed!,"Having this DVR from the NTSC video tape is better than nothing, but a remastered HD Blu-Ray NTSC USA version is sorely needed. The cinematic tableau are completely lost on the VHS version."
1,any ten minutes of this movie are the same.,"I'm not a stupid guy, but when after I saw this movie, I began to question my intelligence. Then I realized that the emperor, like everyone else in this picture, wasn't wearing any cloths. The movie is great to look at, but it all looks the same. You can look at any ten minutes of the movie and it will look like any other ten minutes. Which means that the director was ultimately unsuccessful in finding a way to tell what is one of Shakespeare's best stories. I walked away feeling stupid, but I'm glad I realized that it wasn't really me."
1,One of the worst movies of all time,This movie is awful. I have no idea what statement the director was trying to make but he failed miserably. I couldn't stop laughing during the first 20 minutes - maybe the movie is a comedy.
5,Greenaway Baroque,Greenaway is a master of framing the most visually amazing scenes. This film is rich beyond belief. Why in God's name is this film not on DVD?
4,I want it on DVD!,"This was, at least visually, a superb movie. VHS can't do it justice. I waiting for it to come out on DVD. And waiting, and waiting . . ."
5,Excellent Book!,"I have owned this book for quite some time and every time I use it to analyze my own or someone else's relationship, the descriptions fit exactly. I have not found an easier to use or more expansive book on astrology and relationships. I highly recommend it. This is one of my favorite astrology books."
4,Almost worth it...,"No doubt about it. This is a very nice fan that moves a lot of air. Either the instructions were lacking just a little or my fan had some manufacturing defect. The glass ""bulb cover"" CAN NOT install ""tightly"" as specifiedin the instructions. My fan exhibits a gap between the top of the glas and the rotating portion of the fan towhich the blades are attached that cheapens an otherwise beautiful fan. Thank goodness there are no vibrations or wobbles, either. All in all, a very good, albeit expensive, fan."
1,before you buy this book.....,"Be aware that it is nothing more than a creationist arguing with the evolutionists. There was very little actual quotations and passages of the bible listed in the answers that he gave, and most of the time he managed to say something negative about today's educated people and those who believe in evolution.I really tried to read this book with an open mind and ignore the creationist vs. evolutionist thing. I was looking for an interesting viewpoint or some concrete answers with quotations to back them up. I felt duped by this man and felt that he had fallen into the same rigid, closed-off frame of mind that he was accusing the evolutionists of."
4,Interesting...ok,"The book is interesting for sure. It just doesn't take you too far. But,it's probably worth purchasing as an extra book"
5,Love Ken Ham,He has many insightful arguments as to why evolution is wrong. He often repeats himself. Overall many Christians need to know the information that is discussed in the book.
5,Rainone in good form,"These multilingual vocals by Sal Rainone are a joy to listen to. Mr. Rainone's expressive voice enhances any song he sings. The CD contains 21 songs. Some will relax you. Others will make you want to dance. This reviewer enjoyed them all, but particularly ""Somewhere in Time."""
1,"I am ""Running"" Nowhere","What are we , Morons? What a waste of my time and money. They already released 2 disks will multiple Curly shorts. Where is volume three and four and five with all Curly's? What nincompoop will pay for this? What studio executive is brain dead that they cannot see that we clamor for a collection and not more of the same disk in a miiion different ways. I for one will not buy this and have given up thinking they will release multiple Curly's as they did with Disk One and Two. FORGET IT!! My fond memories are better than this"
2,Rehash of already released material dissapoints,"Colorized stooges. That's what I bought? Amazon linked this ""new"" DVD to me because I have been collecting the Stooges works - my daughters love them (yes - Daughters!). So I was elated to see a new collection out there. But it isn't new, it's stuff already released (in better quality) with the option to watch them colorized. What a Drag. If you don't have any stooges, not a bad buy, but the Boxed set is better, and has all this rehash in the package.Avoid."
1,Pitiful Attempt,"Although I have spent quite a bit of money on The Three Stooges DVD's, I would be more than willing to start sinking some money into a chronological collection of shorts. It's time to start over and do these things properly and quit trying to cash in on repackaging previously released material."
3,deceptively thin,"this ring is much larger in the picture. It is deceptive. The dolphin is smaller than my pinky finger nail and the band about as thin as a penny. It is pretty but could be much prettier and much more durable with a little more effort. You do get what you pay for, I will not be buying from this seller again though."
2,Silver is too thin on ring band,Cute ring but the silver is so thin that it broke within 2 days of wearing it. Low quality item.
5,An excellent pairing,A different setting for each of these musicians that moves their talents in somewhat unexpected directions. They weren't striving for the cutting edge but they find a sweet spot.
1,missing items,the handle of this stand is broken and did not come with any clamps to hold the tribars. so what must i do now?
1,Unimpressed,"After baking three cakes in the pan, I am totally underwhelmed by its performance. The waffle/diamond pattern in the bottom sticks badly unless you use enough oil and flour to fill them. Then, you wind up with so much flour/oil coating on the cake that you must scrape it off. They do NOT clean up easily even with large amounts of oil and flour. I could not hand clean all the residue. The residue would not come off in the dishwasher, either. Only using a Scotchbrite pad could get them clean and this is, of course not recommended.They must be used on a cookie sheet which increases the cooking time. Do not level your batter until you place it on the cookie sheet, because, when you lift the pan, (the pan is flexible) it will undo your work. Also, you cannot use the pan inverted, for assembling because the sides are too flexible.I'm returning them."
3,Fantastic until it Expired,"I loved this microwave, which performed extremely well until it expired dramatically after a year and a half. Before its loud and smokey demise, it was absolutely five-star. I'm desolated...and not sure what to buy now to replace it. Of course I'm wondering if I mistreated it somehow. I don't think so. A mere 18 months seems like a short run, thus the three stars. I've had Sharp microwaves before that have lasted much longer."
1,POS Microwave,Piece Of Schmidt! (not positive):The radiation shield inside the mic started burning and the LED's in the readout went all haywire a few months after buying the damn thing. Bought a used Panasonic that is Much Much Older...and very dependable. Sharp is on my Schmidt list.
5,What a buy!,"My microwave finally died so I started searching for a new one. My family LOVES popcorn and this one has a popcorn button with the option for even a snack bag size! It has popped every kernel perfectly, everytime! I love to option to reheat, but I haven't mastered the sensor heat yet. I think it may take some practice. The microwave is a great size too! I can easily fit a full dinner plate or five potatoes in a circle. It is also very quiet and while the screen might be a little dificult to read at certain angles, it doesn't bother me. I love the timer and it even has an option to keep the food warm which works great! All in all, I would highly suggest this product."
2,"Fast, difficult to see inside","The microwave heats quickly but in a well-lit kitchen (there are several large windows near the microwave) the horizontal pattern of white lines on the door makes it very difficult to see inside. I usually use the microwave for quick heating of things like oatmeal, tea, and melting butter. I try to keep an eye on what's inside because these things have a tendency to boil over but I have to put my face right up to it and shield the door from the light with my hand, and even though there's a grille inside to prevent microwave leakage I still don't think that's healthy."
2,get what you pay for,"typically, sharp makes pretty good stuff, even at the low end. this machine lacks appeal in looks and features. the key pad is not lighted and is difficult to activate programs. it has a cheap look and feal about it along with a cheap version of an l e d display. it cooks o k and gives you what you paid for. the add is a bit misleading about the lighted key pad. it also has a plastic door window."
5,Very Sharp Microwave,Great product. We had another Sharp oven for several years that we were very satisfied with and wanted to buy an equivalent product when the old one died. This oven filled the bill. Same great features plus some new ones. I particularly like the sensor reheat function. No more setting exact times or guessing the quantity of food on the plate. Just slip the food in and press the button and the oven takes care of the rest.
2,Not as bad as you may think.,"The thing to keep in mind is that this album is a failed experiment at pop-fusion, which is something tony dabbled with more than once in the seventies. The songs are cheesey, but the performances are as strong as you would expect.Definitely one for the die-hard Tony fans and nobody else."
2,Soemwhat disappointed,"Given the favorable reviews of others, I was disappointed to find that this book did not present the concepts and practice in what (to me) was a logically coherent way. Concepts and terminology are introduced without discussion, and it is rather dated presentationally. It may, however, be useful as a concise cookbook of technique for those already versed in celestial navigation."
5,Goff is perfect candidate.,"This is a super cool idea and Goff is the perfect architect to start a series/craze such as this. If you don't buy these reels, at least check out some traditional publications on Bruce Goff."
4,Somewhat of a Surprise,"When you see a big label such as A & M, you worry about obtaining the music with artists such as Cecil Taylor. Here Cecil is paired with long time cohort William Parker and Greg Bendian who is a bit of a surprise, and it raises an issue. Is Greg Bendian prepared for the task and ready to play Cecil. Bendian was more than ready. He absolutely kicked some ass. he was loud, brash, and thunderous. More importantly Greg was inside Cecil's music and mastered the task. He understood it, knew it and comprehended it rode the train home in style. 4 stars"
4,If you feel you need to find out how to become fully independent,"Colette really knows what she is on about. If you feel a little uncertain about whether you are independent and mature enough to stay independent and mature enough not to become somebodies little helpless-must-be-cared-for little girl, you can't live without this ""old"" classic.Don't just go for getting a life, get your own life.Any mann should read this book too.A 52 year young mann who read it with great interest. It makes a great and inexpensive gift for your niece or nephew, son, daughter, friend, etc."
4,Nice concise overview pocketbook,"This is a good book for a quick overview of oncology for a starting point. Appropriate for surgical, medical, and radiation oncologist as well as medical students interested in oncology."
1,Useless!,"Do not waste your money to buy this book. It's not clear what the purpose of the authors was when writing it. A manual should provide practical information to the reader (physicians usually) and offer clear direction especially with regard to diagnosis and treatment. The treatment sections of the colorectal cancer and NSCLC (the first two chapters I read)is reviewing some clinical study data in a very concise and confusing way,without saying for example what the current options are for specific type of patients.It's just useless. Don't buy it! It's good for people who'd like to have general, superficial knowledge on cancer, which is probably not the purpose of the book."
3,works like it should,"Used it to plug in my Wii at my parents home when I visit. It's not as good as plugging in the component cables. But it'll suffice. The picture quality is so-so but the audio is excellent. If there's a version by Nintendo, that'd be the one I'd buy."
4,"EZ to use, working good",My old TV needs RF modulator to play DVD output video/audio signals. I bought it 2 months ago. It works well and is easy to use. I can choose either channel 3 or 4 to transfer the DVD signals without disturbing normal TV programs.The only problem is that an extra cable is needed to connect it with my TV set which is NOT included!
1,"Tried two units, both defective","The first unit I received produced a picture, but no sound over the RF connection. So I sent it back for a replacement unit. That one produced no picture or sound. Worthless! I'll be trying a different brand. Note that I double checked all cables and connections to verify that everything else was working properly."
5,TO MAKE AN OLDER TV BETTER,The item worked just great. Our TV is about 15 years old and we received a New VCR-DVD and it would not work withthe TV. But the RECOTON DVD647 RF MODULATOR was just what we needed in order to keep the VCR. I would definitelyrecommend this product to others that has an older TV set.
1,Was Great then broke,"First I rated it great and it was, for two movies. Then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling. The end."
3,got noisy signal,"I used this to hook up DVD player with my old SANYO TV. Cable signal also go through it to TV. Before I use it, the TV signal is clear. After I used it, signal of some, not all, channels became noisy with rolling stripes."
3,Ok for the price,"This product works ok for the price. It was very inexpensive and works ok. It makes a lot of fuzz noise when there is an empty space in the video. The video quality isn't great, but its worth not having to buy a new tv."
2,defective from start,"Item arrived in sealed packaging but was defective once opened. Picture is watchable but dark throughout, and there is no setting on the unit to increase the brightness. Tried different sources, from DVD player to camera or even a computer, all result in a well-formed, dark picture, in contrast with a clear, bright picture I was able to get through my VCR before it broke. I understand this is likely an exception, but you have no way of finding out in advance. I displaced the original package, and now I cannot find any contact info for Recoton company online. The unit says Recoton on some of its parts but Jensen in front, and the Jensen company website does not have this product listed. And finally A1books (seller) policy prohibits me from returning/exchanging the open item."
4,"So far, so good!","Recoton always was a good outfit for a bargain....their videotape was a lifesaver in the 80s and 90s, and apparently their electronics are, now, too. Have had faultless operation of this unit since Christmas. (Keeping fingers crossed!)Better deal than Radio Shack, that's for sure!"
4,Saving me $$$,"This book will pay for itself in just the first few pages! All the useful things you can do - at a fraction of the cost. I knew about some of the uses, but there were so many that I didn't know about. It's a great reference to have on hand, especially when you don't want to drop everything and run to the store... just look in the book -- you'll most likely find what you need!"
3,I thought it was okay,It was okay. not anything to be excited about but it was a good quick read on things. There were some helpful things but I guess because my mom was old fashioned that I already knew about these things.
4,The best guide so far,":There's a lot of information in this book, to help both the neophyte and the upgrading user. The step-by-step approach is practical and helpful, and as complete a guide as one might expect on software.:Mr. Buyens also offers his web address, where one can view corrections and clarifications to the book's contents.:I would have given it 5 stars if it contained additional information on how FP2002 works in background tasks.:Highly recommended."
2,Not Great,"The layout of this book is not impressive. I find myself flipping back and forth and back for every reference to another subject. As a warning, it is a pretty advanced book as far as Frontpage goes. If you have little to no knowledge of Frontpage, get Frontpage for Dummies as this book will be difficult to learn with. This is what I had to do. But after a couple years of experience with Frontpage, I can finally use this book."
4,FrontPage 2002 Inside Out and All Around,"As a novice in Computer Technology, I found this book most helpful in my first endeaver at creating a Website with Frontpage 2002. It takes you from the very basics and goes several steps further. It's a good buy for the price and from what I have seen of several other books, I felt I got my money's worth and more."
2,Hard to use,"Topics in this book are scattered between the text and a CD. Some of the stuff on the CD is critical, so you have to look at both, a nuisance. Also, topics are really only itemized (like a dictionary (not organized logically). So to do anything (like speaking the language with only a dictionary, and not a phrase book) requires a lot of (i)thinking, (ii) page turning and (iii) CD spinning."
2,"Improving, but not there yet","Compared to Running Frontpage 2000 by the same author, this book has eliminated a lot of the blather. Instead of unremitting praise, the author now even admits some of the limitations of Frontpage. There is a lot of detail here, but the book is still a jigsaw puzzle if you want to answer a question or put something together. To add to this difficulty, about 270 pages of the book are on the CD. A lot of this CD material is basic, so you now not only have to flip pages, but spin the CD to explore a topic.Not a winner."
1,Misleading,"I rate myself as an extremely competent user of FrontPage 2002, and yet I battled so much with this book that I sent it back. It should be made clear by the publishers that the book is only for advanced web designers."
2,wrong on Graves,"I bought this book for my wife who suffers from Graves disease. She says the author made mistakes regarding Graves; he refers to a wrong medicine for Graves (a med that is normally prescribed for hypothyroidism), and he recommends a nutritional supplement that is contra-indicated. She set the book aside and said she can't trust the rest of the chapter on Graves after she saw those mistakes. Otherwise, I have no opinion regarding his chapters on other diseases."
1,Bad Buy,"I didnt realize this book was used when i purchased it, it was not in the best condition. Also, the book does not give much info. it doesnt state this in description but it only discusses 5 of the autoimmune diseases when there are WAY MORE then that out there and one or two of them have to do with children autoimmune disease, not just women. So this book is not good, is falsely advertised. I dontated mine."
4,It's About Time Julie Returned,It's About Time is a very good debut album from Julie Reeves. I can't figure out why she didn't go further off this. This ablum has a whole bunch of energy and life and just plain fun in it. Julie's voice is enticing and has a nice acent to it. This is very good mainstream female coutnry. Great songs:Trouble Is a Woman - feistyDo You Think About MeParty DownAll or Nothin'It's About TimeWhateverWhat You Get is What You SEe - Julie does a very good countryfied remake of this song
2,Not A Bad Start,"Julie Reeves' debut CD is like a great roller coaster ride---You remember the ups and the downs. The CD does attempt to mix fast and slow, but comes off as somewhat schizophrenic because the slow songs (including What I Need and You Were A Mountain) are so much better than the fast ones (including Party Down). The only exception is the delightful Trouble Is A Woman. Ms. Reeves hails from the same region as some other, more traditional, female country artists and ""what she needs"" is to focus primariy on her traditional roots and not try so hard to mix old and new. Also, she's a beautiful girl already. She doesn't need to show as much of herself as she does on the back cover."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"This album is perhaps a jewel, one in a million as some may say. I followed Julie from the beginning, critics raved about this album and so did country music fans BUT radio barely picked up on the marvel known as Julie Reeves. The title track It's about time is infectious as well unique. Trouble is a Woman had small radio succcess, but should have been a huge hit. What I need had the most radio success on the album, just cracking the top 40. If Julie decides to come out with a second album, radio u better embrace this artist. U would be a fool not 2."
2,It May not Be Her Time,"There are many country albums that fall through the cracks each year. This is because many of them are so formulaic, so predictable and so safe. Unfortunately Reeves' debut album on Virgin Nashville falls under this category. Sure this album has its shares of ballads and uptempoes but none of them seem to standout. They are all pretty ordinary. Interestingly the most interesting song on this set is Reeves' cover of Tina Turner's hit ""What You See Is What You Get."" However Reeves being a less experienced singer doesn't have the calibre of Turner's way of making this song sounds exciting. Dave Loggins' ""He Keeps me in One Piece"" is beautiful but somehow Reeves fails to ignite the passion of this love ballad. The single and title track has a quasi-rap section but other than that, it's one of those Nashpop numbers. At the end of the day Reeves, like many other artists, is just another new artist that comes and go without much of a splash. Sorry this album may not be her time."
2,Title said 6ft recieved 3ft cable,"The product was satisfactory, average quality and was dilevered in a timely manner. The only problem I had was that I had ordered a 6ft cable but I actually got the 3ft cable which is pretty useless because my TV is more than 3ft tall. I returned the item and Amazons returns process was simple and fast and the service was superb."
1,Not As Shown,"Looking at the item as pictured, it was just what we needed. It appeared that the end attaching to the pacifier was probably velcro. This would have facilitated attachment to many pacifiers. Instead the end had a silicone ring that only allows attachment to pacifiers that have a round or oval raised surface with a lip to hold the ring in place. Not what we needed! We only have 1 or 2 pacifiers made this way. Would not have ordered if pictured correctly!"
3,"Love winnie the pooh, pacifier clip is just ok!","I love Winnie the Pool which is why I bought this. The pacifier is just ok. I don't like these type of clips. It works but it doesn't stay on as good as the Boogin Head Pacifier Clips. It's super cute but I wouldn't recommend this as a sturdy pacifier clip. If you are looking for a more sturd clip, then I would try the Boogin Head ones."
2,Dun like it,"It looks cute but the wire is too short, the clip is big and hard which hurts my baby if he touches it."
2,color washed off,"Color washed off within one month of use and its a little too bulky for a newborn. Recommend trying ""Baby Buddy Bear Pacifier Holder"" Love them."
3,not as pictured,"The clip is ok, holds well to most fabrics. the loop to tie the clip to the pacifier is hard to use. They added a plastic loop (not in the picture) so that the clip may be used with pacifiers with or without a ""handle"". while this should make the clip more versatile, the two connect-to-pacifier features trip over each other. still, it is sturdily built and lasts."
4,Keeps pacifier handy. Just don't boil.,"This is a nice strap to help keep your child's pacifier from getting lost. Our daughter loves the colors and the Pooh figure. She has two, each one with a ""paci"" (one as a primary and one as a backup).The only issue with this (and partially our fault) is that when boiling the ""paci"" to disinfect it the hot water started softening the plastic on one of the clips. It's no longer a big deal since we just take the""paci"" off and hand wash the strap."
2,Good Looks but Bad Mechanics,When I first looked at it I was like Alright. It looked awesome but I went to go shoot it and it didn't shoot very fast and it doesn't have a hop up system so it curves down. But if you are bying it for the looks then go for it. One other thing though it is not very heavy so it doesn't feel realistic . But I do not recomend this gun.
1,A pros reveiw,this is bad for it says the price used to be 29999.99 or something like that and that is a lie even real pistols dont cost that much they just want to lure you into this product!
2,Good and Bad,"This product stays in place while in use, which is the good part. Dough still sticks to it, but the worst part is clean up. It's impossible to clean in the sink and impossible to dry. Towel fibers stick to the surface and clothing fibers and hair and other things you would not expect. Perhaps the best method is to wipe it down with a wet cloth while still on the counter top and leave it there to air dry."
1,Great Product but S&H charge.....,"1 star because of the excessive S&H; charge. This is a great product. I have used it for years. However, the S&H; charge of over $8 is abusive.The product can be found on line elsewhere for a S&H; charge of under $4."
3,Good for Measuring,"I like this because I can never accurately judge the size for a pie. I am not a fan of it's flimsy construction. It is very thin, but as others said, it adheres well to the counter."
5,Silicone wonder,This mat is everything it is supposed to be. Wish I had gotten it sooner.Makes rolling out dough very easy and less frustrating. Worth every penny paid for it.
1,Completely Unusable and Missing Letters,"I purchased 2 of these at once because of the letters I required. First off, the amount of each letter they put in one package is silly and incorrectly adverstised. In addition to not receiving the actual letters I thought I would, they did not work. The few letters, 2 out of the 12 I attempted to fasten to a hoodie, just fell off when they cooled down. The other ten I tried never stuck in the first place. Just in case you are doubting - yes, I made sure I had the right side down. I gave up on them after 2 hours. I gave the remaining letters to my sister-in-law. She runs a daycare and they do all kinds of crafts all the time. She gave up on them too. She said she had never seen iron on letters not work.~Fun note: I ordered two packages to begin with, both orange, and they showed up different shades of orange.If you decide to purchase these anyway, I sincerely wish you the best of luck. It is always possible I just got a bad batch."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"When I first read about this movie, I was intrigued, and went out of my way to get a copy. It was a mistake! The story makes no sense and has more holes than a log of Swiss cheese. As for the cast, I've seen better acting in reality shows. This movie was just a big waste of time!"
1,You must be joking me!,"The other reviewer must be involved with the production of this film (and I use the term loosely), because this movie is GARBAGE! Unfortunately, I paid $3 for this mess on Amazon streaming via my Roku. This is the first film I wanted my money back from Amazon! I kid you not, it looks like it was filmed with a low-end camcorder, I've seen better acting at my daughter's middle school, and the storyline is a bore and obvious. Yes, I am upset! I want my 90+ minutes and my $3.00 + Texas sales tax BACK!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"Thought it didn't have any sticker in the back, turns out, there are lots of them, I would say you get what you pay for"
1,"Patches, patches everywhere!","One star rating for a incomplete description of the item! What the description fails to mention is that the back of this jacket is covered in sewn on patches - a huge patriotic eagle on the middle back as well as several smaller patches. The 2 patches on the front I can handle; 5+ more, NO. If I had known they were there I would not have purchased the jacket. Since I got it for such a good price it is not worth the shipping fee to return it. I will donate it to a local charity that provides coats for the needy, and buy my son another jacket."
2,Interesting Jacket...,"To start, I would like to say that this jacket is relatively cheap for being all leather. Which is nice, except that it is literally frankensteined together. It is made of about 400 different buffalo hide scraps, and they are not symmetrical.It also came with a secret. The back of this coat had 5 patches sewed on, including a huge decal that read ""Live to Ride,"" and had a picture of an eagle and an american flag. I did manage to get them off, at the cost of ripping the jacket in a small area.Saying that, this is a warm, heavy coat that fits good enough (tight sleeves and a loose back for a huge beer gut to fill). I probably wouldn't buy this product again, as I would rather have fabric over this patchwork of leather strips and patches."
2,The package was great item had flaws,when I got this item had a Rip in the seam in the back and it wasent worth the shipping cost to get it replaced. over all after i got the Seam fixed and take off all the patches it looks great over all worth the 40 bucks you'll spend on it. Prob not worth much more then that.
1,disappointment,Cheap Charlie! Husband hated it! I hate it. look at pic closely before buying! Diamond plate must be another name for little pieces stitched together
4,Good Price,Good value for the price. I took off some of the patches as am more of a car guy than a motorcycle person
1,"Real poor quality, wont last",First the image here is not representative of what you're buying. in fact the leather is just made of small fragments sewed in together and the quality is rather poor and the sown starts to fall apart just after a few times of wearing it. Furthermore some of my leather pieces are of poorer quality and the paint starts to peel off.And of course the back has some huge decal that is not shown in the picture and it should be.
4,OOPS!,I inadvertently ordered the wrong size but it fits my son quite well and is a very serviceable jacket especially for the price.
2,Not even 75% happy,"Your ad indicated the jacket had logo on front but not so much on back, not happy with that . Would have preferred plain back with no logo. But the worst part about the jacket was when I opened the box it had a strong mildew odor. It was as if it had been stored a long time in someones basement. Will most likely return itRB Ellis, Michigan"
2,"Thin, cheaply made","""You get what you pay for"" applies perfectly. I thought this would be a good motorcycle riding jacket but it's too thin and looks like from a rack in a bargain basement. OK for hanging out with posers."
4,"A Wonderful, Inspirational Book to Offer Hope","I've loved pearls for their symbolism, and have given many gifts of pearls to friends and family. As the author discusses beautifully, pearls are a glowing metaphor for life, struggle and hope. The book is very well written, the self-questions provide a helpful tool, and it's packed with all kinds of interesting facts/information about pearls of all kinds. The only reason I'm not giving five stars to this book is because there are a few places where a mystical or new-agey emphasis seemed to snag the otherwise smooth flow. They're in the form of poetry or fairy tales within the text, and at least once I wasn't sure how the section fit in to the rest of the chapter. Nevertheless, it's an excellent book worthy of gift-giving. I bought another copy, in fact, to give as a gift."
2,Revised Opinion - AVOID,"This is an update of a prior review I wrote of this book, I changed my mind. I hadn't read the entire book but had been impressed with what I had read. The book does cover many aspects of commercial banking including regulations, capital and liquidity management, things of most interst to me as an analyst. However, a significant problem is that many of the examples used appear to be incorrect. For instance, the text often does not match the accompanying exhibits or tables. Perhaps the book was not edited well during an update to a new edition, and either the text or the exhibit/table was updated but not both (ie, in numerous cases they disagree). Whatever the reason, the numerous typographical errors made the book difficult to read, especially in a ""self-study"" situation. I'm looking elsewhere for a better guide."
2,"Lots of information, horrible presentation",I am in my last year of school and preparing to embark on a career in banking. Out of all the finance and economics (I'm a double major) textbooks I have used this is the absolute worst bar none. While the text has a very large amount of information that same information is simply thrown at you with no real presentation.One other thing that bothers me (possible the most) is the fact that I get severe headaches when I read this text. I have never read a book before with text this small. To me this says something since I am a voracious reader and frequently am reading 3-4 novels while also studying for my classes.
2,Review of 7th edition,"I have been using this textbook for almost a full semester now for an online class in bank management. The book starts off ok (if a bit dry), but the errors and poor editing become worse as the book progresses. This edition contains many typos, and several of the end of chapter questions seem to refer to topics covered in later chapters. Maybe the topics were in a different order in earlier additions and the questions were not revised. In any event, if your class requires this book, either don't take it online or pick a different class. If you do decide to take an online class using this book, google is your friend."
2,I use this book for my Bank Management class and would not recommend it.,"The reviews stating that this book is dry and monotonous are right on target. There are numerous errors in the book and the teacher's guide with regard to referencing the Exhibits in the text, which is really unacceptable for a 6th edition. The examples are overly complicated and I find myself constantly searching for outside articles and examples that are more interesting and straightforward.The text font is very small and the detail and complexity can be overwhelming for an introductory banking course.Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of bank management texts out there, but I will continue to look for a better alternative.Update: I switched texts this past semester to Principles of Banking (published by the American Bankers Association). It is definitely for a beginning banking class. I increased the complexity of the class by adding bank financial analysis and you could also add some risk management to fill out the course."
1,"TEDIOUS, REPETITIVE, BUY NYQUILL INSTEAD!!",This is likely the worst textbook I have come accross in my finance career. The writing is extremely dry and the authors do not make an effort to summarize anything. They love narrating long concepts and mixing it with dull examples that make you completely lost. The concepts in each chapter are repeated twice for absolutely no reason. This sucker will make you fall asleep as fast as NyQuill - without the good relaxing feeling.
5,A Damn Good CD!,"Chris Daniels and the Kings are the whole package! Rhythm, blues, funk, swing and Reggae, they can do it all. And this CD truly defines their talent and inspiration. It's a 'must have' addition to everyone's CD collection!"
3,Predates Stone's controversial epic,"Not the greatest, but still intriguing examination of the JFK assasination. If you thought Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" raised some interesting issues, well, a good lot of them are covered here."
3,Three-and-a-half stars. Good film but too much hanging on 'right-wing-done-it' conspiracy,"See it with your girlfriend on aSaturday night with Mel Gibson'sConspiracy Theory, the TV print.Moshe Levine is Mark Lane's realname and he became part of thecorrupt Carto empire later asattorney Mark Lane, who really didmeet JFK back in New York in 1960."
2,Absurd Speculation,The major fault of this conspiracy theory is there are too many people in on the plot. And everyone knows everyone. The twenty-plus people involved cannot keep a secret like the assassination of JFK quiet for long.
4,Watch this movie!,"Before Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" was this movie, and just like Mr. Stone's epic movie this reveals what might have happened."
5,Hush!,"This is THE movie for conspiracy buffs. Oliver Stone did a more recent and similar movie, ""JFK"", but that was bloated and overdone. ""Executive Action"", is a more believable and tighter movie. The only film I can compare it to is ""Winter Kills"", an underrated semi-satire with another great cast."
4,Thought-provoking Look at the JFK Assassination,"So many theories, so little time! While there is lkely no way to conclude who was behind the JFK murder, it was interesting to me to see that an audio taped interview of Jackie Kennedy Onassis surfaced, however briefly, about a year ago. This was covered by the mainstream media, but then the tape was given to the Kennedy clan, out of ""respect"" (because the media is so keen on ""respect"", right?). Of course, the news story simply disappeared. Anyway, in that taped interview from the '70's, Jackie stated clearly that she KNEW that LBJ was the one who orchestrated JFK's assassination. Likely we'll never know what really happened that day in Dallas, but this movie poses an entertaining scenario. Burt Lancaster is great in his role."
3,Forgotten Gem,"I bought this movie on VHS not knowing that it had recently been put out on DVD. I had seen it a long time ago and wanted to check it out again as I am a big Burt Lancaster fan. It was everything I remembered. I must say that I thought it was a pretty good movie but it left me wanting more scenes of this cabal of powerful men debating and planning the actual assassination of JFK. I thought the parts with the assassins practicing and training was done pretty well and the stock documentary footage was also done well. But if they could have cut all that out and had more with Lancaster, Robert Ryan, Will Geer and others it would have been a much better movie. It isn't as wild and crazy as the obvious comparison with Oliver Stones 'JFK' but it was an interesting take on what might have happened."
4,It Just Makes You Wonder,"I've watched this film countless times and always enjoy it. Who knows how accurate the plot is? What we do know is that we have never been told the ""whole"" story. Does it matter? Yes,if as a nation we want to have TRUTH. Will we get the truth? No. We've lost control. Too sad. Too bad."
4,executive action,"an oldie but a goodie.. saw this movie for the first time in the 70's. a movie for conspiracy therorists on the Kennedy assasination. While I don't agree with the theory, (an oil company paid to have Kennedy assasinated) the movie is based on facts that severely question the Warren Commission. Since I have bought it, I have loaned it to about 4 people who all love it"
3,Maltin bombed on this one,"I almost didn't watch this movie when I saw Leonard Maltin had rated it a ""Bomb,"" but I'm glad I did. I agree that the pace early on could have been quicker, but overall the movie presented its theory pretty well.While JFK was a mystery investigating a murder, this is a step-by-step recreation of how the crime might have happened. I'm not a conspiracy buff, and I felt this film presented some of the theories more clearly than did JFK, and seemed to make a better attempt at staying historically accurate."
4,When this was out in theaters many years ago I went to see it and was happy to see that it was out on DVD.,"It was made many years ago, but the quality of picture and sound were still very good. I have enjoyed watching it and would recommend it to other people who are still curious about the Kennedy assasination."
2,Poor Production Quality,"This movie is so grainy, I had to check the date it was made. Sometime in the 1950s, right? No, 1993. There is absolutely no excuse for such poor quality. My 7 year-old likes the movie, but wanted to watch it on a smaller TV (that is a first!) thinking that it might look better. Didn't help."
3,"Not bad or horrible, could of been better.","The book had scratches on the cover due to packaging according to seller. I thought shipping would of been faster, but at least I didn't wait the max time slated. As well, some pages were crinkled when first open, suppose to be brand new. Other then that, pretty good seller and book seems to be okay."
1,Liberal Propaganda,"I was forced to purchase this book for a college class. It doesn't take long to find out this book was written to keep pushing the liberal agenda. This book is all about how humans have destroyed the earth already and how the earth would be better off without humans. Don't buy this book unless you want to read about how all biological problems are a direct result of human actions. This book is an example of how our school systems are infected with socialist, closed minded, left wing educators. I threw this book into the local landfill to one, keep this book out of circulation and two, to add to my ""carbon footprint"".:)"
1,unhappy with purchase - Allen bike rack,"Once the bikes were on the rack, it didn't close easily. Also the item came rusty and got further rusted in the first rainstorm. I wouldn't recommend this for the difference in price the Yakima or Thule are much better."
3,Stripped Bolt,I purchased this item and I really do love it except for the fact that tbe bolt/screw with the large gray handle (to lock bike rack when driving) has stripped after just 2 months of use and now i'm in the process of dealing w/ Thule and the manufacturer to get this replaced... This just happened this weekend so we'll see how long it takes!
2,"Way too Heavy, hard to swing open",This hitch mount is way over complicated design and thus making this thing weights a ton. It's very difficult to swing open also... even without any bikes mounted.
4,Good buy for the money,"The good: This rack works exactly as advertised. It's all steel and will certainly last many years. The price is the most attractive feature. This is a fraction the cost of the popular name units and performs just as well.The bad: The thing is heavy. Really heavy. Don't forget to regularly check the tightness of nuts and bolts. A few more lock washers or nylock nuts might be a nice addition. The hitch piece needs to be a couple inches longer to clear the spare tire of a land rover discovery. (Or buy a small hitch extender.) It fits my pickup fine.The ugly: Some of the welds look a little rough. Nothing that would compromise the ability to carry a few bikes, but it's certainly not perfect. The powder coat finish isn't the most durable. After a couple summers riding on the back of the wifes land rover it looks a bit faded and scratched.For the price, I would certainly buy it again if I ever need to replace it."
4,Good belt,"Good belt, a little hard to take on and off, as told to me by the person it was given to. But they love it so and says it's a good belt."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have never given a bad review but i was really disappointed. My mom ,who I bought it for as a gift, said it skipped and that the disk was scratched. Unfortunately she had thrown the invoice away so could not return it. So I have to say I would not buy from this seller again."
3,A decent greatest hits album,"I am not a huge Buddy Holly fan, but I have always like his music as I do listen to alot of 50's music. I liked this album, it has all the songs I know by him. ""Maybe Baby"" being a personal fave...reminds me of the show ""happy days"" for some reason. Buddy Holly was a true pioneer of rock, and was taken far too soon. This is a good tribute for the casual fan to listen to.By by, miss american pie..."
5,Camsmom,Exactly what I was hoping for. It was a gift for my brother and I couldnt find it anywhere. Very happy!
4,"History, technical",The most splendid book on early tank development I have ever read. I traces down all the difficulties the engineers and inventors faced when proposing a new idea for breaking the trench-stalemate to the military establishment. Almost all of this establishment believed in the well-proven tactics of the 19th century.Actually the idea of an armored fighting vehicle was NOT so new; Leonardo da Vinci worked with the same idea.
5,Land Ships and Winston Churchill ..,"Interesting book, the tank was originally conceived as a land ship and Winston Churchill was a key driver of it ... amazing stuff.The tank was designed to overcome machine guns and trenches which dominated the battlefield, and it took the British a while to realise that their true value was in fact as a form of modern heavy cavalry, so the first use of tanks was largely wasted until Cambrai.Lots of photos and illustrations - good book."
1,Bad Quality Control,BEWARE! The cover on this item is so sharp that both myself and my husband cut our hands while drying the cover. I don't understand how this item by Sitram ever left the factory.Sincerly Mrs K.
4,No Iron Man or Perry Mason?,"This CD is awsome i got it for christmass, but no iron man or perry mason? Well i still enjoy it very much. Oz fest is going to be hot this year."
1,This is a greatest hits???,"The left off so many good songs, and instead gave us demos of Black Sabbath songs? How dissapointing."
3,"Yes, It Rocks, But...","I've been listening to Ozzy since the first Black Sabbath album was released, and have been a fan since. He's always great, but I don't understand why anyone would blow an opportunity to showcase Ozzy's solo career with old Sabbath tunes. I mean, they couldn't even get ""Flying High Again"" on this? Ozzy had exactly three solo hits, and whoever botched this collection couldn't even get all three on this disc . Pretty pathetic assembly, if you ask me. Given the magnatude of Ozzy's talent, you'd think that someone who gave a... about the man's contribution to rock would have put this together. As it is, there is no decent Ozzy collection as of yet. Great Sabbath collections, but no Ozzy."
2,BEEZLE-BOOB,"OZZY OSBOURNE-THE OZZMAN COMETH: Am I the only brain dead idiot out there that doesn't subsribe to the theory that musically ""Ozzy is God"", and not ""The Prince of Dorkness""? THE OZZMAN COMETH is a collection of Beezle-Boob's so-called career highs (I'll skip the easy joke), mostly focusing on his post-Sabbath output, save a couple of throwaway ""new versions"" of BS classics. The Randy Rhoads-propelled early hits CRAZY TRAIN and I DON'T KNOW represent Ozzy's best solo work, that era's power sorely diminished by later synth-intrusive power ballad dreck like MAMA I'M COMING HOME and IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER. There's nothing here that Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done better, with at least a fundamental grasp on harmony. Ozzy has bitten off some canny career chunks, from small critters' heads to MTV's snooze-fest THE OSBOURNES. As for innovative, engaging rock & roll?...this anthology just kinda bites.RATING: TWO RABIES SHOTS"
2,long,you should be able to listen to more that just a couple seconds of the songs needs to be longer
2,BONUS CD is ALSO A CD-ROM!,"I must tell everyone THE BONUS CD is ALSO A CD-ROM. It has a game, online, and videos. I don't like the Ozzman Cometh other than this. Crazy Babies should be replaced with Miracle Man and Mama, I'm coming home could be replaced. Only get it for the bonus CD. You can play videos, go online, Screen Killer, and break Ozzy's bones. The only other reason is the crap recordings of Sabbath Songs. WARPIGS HAS DIFFERENT LYRICS. The only other time these lyrics appear is on the BLACK SABBATH STORY VOl.1 VIDEO. GET IT, IT'S BETTER. OZZY HAS MANY GREAT ALBUMS, BUT THIS ONE IS DISAPOINTING. I give 1 star because we have to and 1 star for the BONUS CD which is ALSO A CD-ROM. Try it out. I AM NOT LYING!"
3,"Not All The Greatest Hits, But Some","This is a decent compilation, however, there are plenty of other songs he could have put on it instead. ... with a few song switches and with several songs added in, this would be the perfect greatest hits CD ever! By it if you are new to OZZY or just a huge fan that must have every album ever released by him. OZZY OSBOURNE RULES!"
5,excellent musical masterpiece!,ozzy really came through with this release. this is indeed a musical masterpiece ozzy's best yet.
5,OZZY RULES,ozzy is the godfather of metal and the one who started making the outsiders feel welcome. If you are a true metal fan you must atleast respect him if not love him. This album was one of his greatest it had all the best of the albums buy it!
1,Not needed.,The Ozman cometh??? if this is all he's got left the Ozman needs to goeth the hell awayeth.
4,Great .... but sadly not a 5-star,"I was pondering on whether to give this CD a 4 or a 5 star rating but finally I decided on a 4. Mainly for two reasons. Ozzy has too many unforgettable hits to squeeze into one CD. He should have either done a double CD or else made a 1980-1990 and a 1990-2000 greatest hits album like U2 or whatever. Secondly for putting useless tracks such as the Black Sabbath basement tapes and also for putting live tracks were he could have put the original recording. Otherwise this CD is a rollercoaster ride from track 3 onwards, even though I wouldn't have started the Ozzy hits with a ballad. Maybe the two weak points in his hits, but nonetheless good tracks, are Crazy Babies and Over The Mountain. Could have easily been substituted by tracks such as Flying High Again and Miracle Man. But the classics like Mr. Crowley, Mama I'm Coming Home, No More Tears, Crazy Train and Shot In The Dark are there."
2,"No Need For A ""Best Of "" cd","The reason that I rated this cd 2 stars is that you can hear all of the songs basically on his solo cd's. The only plus part on this cd is ""Black Sabbath"" (Alternative Lyrics), ""War Pigs"" (Alternative Lyrics) and ""Back On Earth (not included on Ozzmosis). This cd is ok only for Ozzy newcomers but not for the die hard fan like me. Buy this cd only if you are a new fan or just need to fill up your Ozzy collection."
5,Absolutely Gnarly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved the songs, Crazy Train, Mama, I'm coming home, and Goodbye to Romance, and Mr Crowley. These few songs plus all the others on this totally outstanding CD will be out of your world!!!"
4,Completes the Carving Equipment Overview.,"I am a professional carver and also teach the art. For anyone needing an informative guide as to wood selection, equipment, and shop aids this book and Volume I should answer your questions in detail. Most books on wood working equipment are skewed ( ! ) toward cabinet making or building construction. These titles are for the wood carver by someone who has ""been there, done that"" with a classic carving background. The first Volume of ""Woodcarving Tools,M & E"" is required reading, especially the approach to sharpening. Volume 2 is equally important for anyone serious about learning to carve!"
4,Great wedding band for my husband,"Beautiful band, much nicer then I thought it was going to be. My husband gets compliments almost weekly, and says it is very comfortable. The only thing we do not like about it, is that it cannot be sized. Small price to pay, for such a comfortable, and beautiful, yet masculine ring."
2,not as advertised,"The Amazon description of this says it is suitable for ""any cooking surface,"" without any restrictions, and the Sitram Web site specifically says ""induction ready."" So to be sure I e-mailed Sitram, and they assured me that it was indeed induction ready. Well, it is not. Aluminum and stainless steel, without the ferromagnetic material needed to work on an induction cooktop. Amazon did not explicitly misrepresent it, but Sitram did. If that doesn't matter to you, it looks like a fine pan. If it does matter, be warned not to believe what you read."
4,WRITTEN WITH GESTURES BY A SILENT SAGE,"Meher Baba had a different point of view, and explains why life is as it is.As Shridi Sais closest student he writes with authority.The book was not written but dictated thru unique gestures (not ASL)!VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and its not 'easy' reading....."
5,A FUN READ,"A FUN READ WHEN BASEBALL, AND ALL SPORTS, WERE ABOUT PEOPLE, NOT MONEY. A FUN TIME WITH EVENTS THAT WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED TODAY, ONLY ORCHESTRATED ONES.PROFITS WERE ALWAYS MADE, HOWEVER IT WAS A TIME WHEN ALL, NOT JUST WEALTHY AND EXPENSE ACCOUNTS (WHICH DIMINISH DIVIDENDS), COULD BOTH AFFORD AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY (FEW SEASON TICKET HOLDERS) TO SEE AN ACTUAL EVENT. NOW IT'S JUST TELEVISION, WHICH COULD BE TAKING PLACE IN NIGERIA."
5,a winner-Eagles songs & good bluegrass,so glad I happened onto the pickin' on series. am recent convert to bluegrass (now a devotee)..big fan of strings...and to hear my favorite Eagles this way is a real treat. I don't understand people who listen to this album and expect it TO BE the Eagles. this is a wonderful TRIBUTE to thier songwriting & I'd like to thank everyone responsable for it.
2,Surprisingly Soul-less,"Received CD as a gift, and never returned it. The best songs are when the banjo and fiddle take the songs in a direction that the Eagles never intended to go. 'New Kid In Town' is a unintentially funny song that is probably my favorite on the album."
1,There ain't no Eagles in here!,I received this as a gift. These guys are pretty good at picking but it is not the Eagles.It is a bunch of guys who apparently can't write their own songs so play someone else's songs.They apparently also can not sing so this is just the music without words.The gift giver was unhappy to find out it wasn't really anEagles CD (the phrase 'a tribute' was covered by the price sticker) and no one lets you return an opened CD.What a waste of money.
3,opps,I didn't realize it was only a summary of the original book.I wished that would have been made clear.
2,Not too helpful study/leader's guide,"I have to admit that I have not YET read the entire book, but there are VERY few discussion questions. Only a couple of good insights in the commentary really. I found 1 original analogy helpful... I will still read it along with the book for what little I can glean from it. Shipping from this vendor was not as fast as most I order."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for the actual book, not the CliffsNotes version. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the description more carefully, but it appeared to be a version with added commentary, not comments on excerpts of the book. The comments were somewhat helpful, but I was disappointed that I didn't get what I thought I was paying for."
3,Lack of insight,"I was disappointed in the Shepherd's Notes on Bonhoeffer's The Cost of Discipleship. The notes section did not seem to add anything to the chapter summary. However, since the original Bonhoeffer book is very difficult to read, the Shepherd's Notes chapter summaries were quite helpful. I wish that the book had provided more critical insight into the original work by Bonhoeffer."
3,skipping?,"If you're looking to skip out on reading the real book, this is for you. But I recommend reading the real thing, not the short notes."
1,PLEASE NOTE -- THIS VERSION IS NOT THE BOOK,"The reviews published above are for Bonhoeffer's book, ""The Cost of Discipleship."" The book shown above, however, is a STUDY COMPANION, and not the book itself. Bonhoeffers' actual book, as marketed by Amazon, can be found by typing 0684815001 (the ISBN) into the search box."
1,Not The Cost of Discipleship,"I bought this book thinking it was the actual ""Cost of Discipleship"" that Bonhoeffer wrote, but it is not! It is only a study guide. Now I have to spend more money for the real thing. Tricky... the commentaries and reviews are the same."
1,Misleading Title!!!,"The book The Cost of Discipleship is a must read. However this is not the book. Several of the reviews help to enforce this mislabel. There needs to be something in the title to the effect of ""study guide"" or something so that people are not spending money on the wrong item. This is dishonest and a poor business practice for Amazon."
2,"Different strums for different chums, I suppose...","I'm a folk and singer/songwriter fan from way, way back, (Woody Guthrie was still alive, for instance, although too ill to perform or record) and this is the second David Wilcox CD I've owned. I feel the same way about both albums. He is competent and pleasant, but none of the tracks, at first or second hearing, jump out at me and say ""You've got to hear this again right now"" or even ""soon."" I felt entranced by Christine Lavin when I first heard her, and Bill Morrisey when I first heard him, and Gordon Lightfoot and James Taylor, same thing, but not David, and frankly, not many of the writer/singer flock that emerged from say 1980 through now. I'll bet I'd like him in person, but based on my limited acquaintance with his work, he is an artist I'll buy from the bargain bin but not at full retail."
5,Super Dave,"I've owned this disc for so many years and its frightening how it remains in frequent rotation. This is a gem that couples superb songwriting with amazing lyrics. Twelve (?) years later I am still stunned by the message of ""Leave it Like it is"", sensuously intrigued by ""Just a Vehicle"" and plain gladdened by ""Rusty Old American Dream"" (as well as returned to my youth!). And I really need to go on, for the depth of the other songs begs discussion...but you need to buy this and then you can e-mail your comments for a sidebar chat."
5,I'll give it 6 stars if you let me!,"What can I tell you about this CD? Let me start by saying I consider this to be unquestionably the finest singer/songwriter CD ever released. Let me continue by saying that it might just be the finest collection of songs currently available. Let me finish by saying that without this CD, your collection of music has a large hole in it. If you haven't heard David's work then you are unaware of the standard which all other contemporary folk must be judged by. This album will make you laugh, cry and think. What more could you ask for? Try it now - thank me later!"
5,Simply brilliant,"This CD grabbed me from minute one. I discovered David after hearing Eye of the Hurricane on the radio one day and picking up the cassette to listen to in the car. I literally wore the cassette out. After seeing him in concert I was in awe of David's ability to hold everyone enraptured, the audience is literally putty in his hands. And he is the also one of the most gracious performers you'll ever see. He has the most amazing ability to turn a phrase I think I've seen. The images, metaphors, and the messages of his music are brilliantly simple and beautiful. I would recommend this one and Big Horizon for starters and the rest to follow. Don't let this one get away."
2,SiliconeZone falls short,"After reading the reviews for this silicone baking mat and the silpat mats being out of stock, I thought I'd take a chance despite some of the reviews complaining of a chemical smell and taste. Sadly, I have to agree. It takes a very keen tongue to taste, but the chemical taste is definetly there. I've tried it with jelly rolls, and cookies and they both soaked up the chemical taste. Save your money and just buy the original silpat because siliconezone falls short of comparing to it."
5,A quest for inner strength and satisfaction,"The saga of a man who feels restrained by conventions and flat ground. Unable to find peace in the heights of his job as a roofer of churches he travels to southern France to assault the Alps. Climbing alone he negotiates the granite faces of the mountains until he takes on their majestic qualities himself. When a friend is trapped on the mountain, he makes a daring one man rescue during a storm that brings him the notice he has always shunned. But glory is fleeting and he returns to the anonymity he prefers having satisfied the only person of importance in his life, himself. This superbly written prose includes a description of being struck by lightning that is so vivid that you feel it. Salter is without question one of America's great writers and this is one of his best"
3,Worth the money,"We purchased this video for a health fair at work. We wanted to demonstrate stretching to other employees and spare ourselves the chore of doing them ourselves over and over again for an entire day. I did a lot of searching prior to coming across this DVD, and it met our main criteria: cheap. Other videos marketed towards company ergonomics were at least $100 more. The computer animation is more watchable than you would guess. My only complaint is that you can't simply push play once and watch it from start to finish."
1,Just horrible,I am not going to slam this guy but he really needs to work on his skill level. I am truly embarrassed to own this.
1,How to Save $100,"If you're looking for a DVD on Miyamoto Musashi's fighting style, Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu as of this posting you shall not find one. In these DVDs, Alexander is selling you something that he created and has no connection with Musashi's style. I'm well aware that if you look around online you'll find other alledged Musashi DVDs, but trust me when I tell you there are none. The closest you'll get to knowing about the Ryu is through Musashi's Book of Five Rings, after that Japan is probably your next best bet, well unless you can find one of the students of the style. Anyways, if you haven't caught drift of what I'm saying by now, I'll make it simple...""DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD."" - Thank you."
4,The same as before,There is no expiration date on the box or bottle. All the products were made in USA has expiration date. I like that the ingredients on the box.
3,"Not as pictured - round, wavy","These washers are round, not rectangular as in the picture. 3 ""waves"", not 2 as pictured.They're reasonably priced, but use caution if you want them for jewelry and specifically want the unusual shape. They are wavy, but looking straight down at them, they have the same round shape as any other washer."
1,shopworn cliche,"This book was utter nonsense! First off the hero is a stuck up regency style A-Hole. He was so in lust with the heroine's cousin that he planed to trick her into marriage so he doesn't have to contend with all her other more wealthy and titled suitors. So when his plans go wrong and he ends up compromising the wrong woman suddenly she is the one that tricked him into marriage? And he is really bitter about it, what a hypocrite. He has a chip on his shoulder about being the second son (Surprised? I'm not). The heroine is so in love with this guy most of the book and is for lack of a better term a doormat. This book offered nothing to the genre that hasn't been done a million times and to top it off the author's sentence structure was hard to follow at times. The hero really killed this book for me, I almost stopped reading after the rape scene. AWFUL AWFUL AWFULYe have been warned..."
2,now I know why it was sold at a discounted price,"This is not one of Heather Cullmans best works. I did not like the hero at all! The story outline showed promise, but without any redeeming qualities in the hero, it's not worth anyones time to read."
2,"Lots of concept, not much application","As a new administrator, I found the basics on network layout and topography interesting. I didn't however find much to sink my teeth into. The book will mention using a certain feature of NT, but then won't tell you how to actually use it. Little or no meat on these bones. How bout some real nuts and bolts of ""this is how you do..."" and a little less ""we love Microsoft"" and ""use tape backups"" to give me a tru reference guide and not a conceptual overview?"
1,"Amatuerish, laughable, poorly crafted and executed production ...","To call this production a ""movie"" takes a lot of ""brass"". To say it was ""terrible"" would be a complimentary ""step up""."
3,Milking The Cash Cow,"Never been a big fan of ""Live"" or ""Best Of"" cds, especially from groups I like, such as Chevelle. This is simply to pay for the cost of the new cd that they are currently working on, though they call it a celebration of 10 years of Chevelle. Yeah, they sound good live and all, but most already have all their cds, so unless you're either a completist or a casual, this is really a waste."
2,Terrible Sound Mix on Audio CD,"The sound on the CD is terrible! I'm as big a Chevelle fan as any, but can't recommend this combo. The DVD is great for those not fortunate enough to see them live, but the audio could have been much, much better."
4,Good Exercises,These DVDs are very good. Worth the money if you follow through with the exercises as directed.
5,BRIDGES OR BURDENS-LIFESAVOR,This book changed my life drastically. It made me realize who in my circle at my best interest at heart and who was in my life to use me. It also helped me to identify who was causing the stress in my life. I am thankful for Pastor Matthews for visiting my church and delivering a powerful message. I would recommend this book to everyone.
5,Hurlin' Guitars ! England is a good friend to William S.,"Sublime, puissant, oppressant et musicalement très très fort.Les guitares sont bien en place et en avant. Le mixage est parfait. Un des tous meilleurs albums de l'Histoire du Rock !Un must."
3,Disappointed,"I was happy to find this CD because I loved the album and wanted a digital copy of it. When I played it I was disappointed to find that the artist chose to make some changes to the music. It was a mega hit the first time around, so I couldn't understand why the artists chose to change it. The artist added notes and changed the timing of the songs, which I could no longer sing along with. I played the CD once, and will probably never listen to it again. If this is your first time around with this artist, it might seem good to you. But I was happy with the original, and unhappy with the remake."
5,Bill Haley & his Comets - Now that's Rock & Roll,"Great CD - Contains his hits and the earlier, less known songs. The Stereo quality is good. I Highly recommend this one."
4,A primer that leaves you asking for more,"Although I don't have this collection, I can tell you that this is an excellent collection for those who just want a basic primer of his career but once you like this, it may leaving you asking for more music. All of these songs, minus Skinny Minnie, and more are on the now OOP ""From The Original Master Tapes,"" and ""Skinny Minnie"" and a few others are available on the 1991 CD reissue of the 1968 Decca LP ""Bill Haley's Greatest Hits."" If you are really a diehard fan and want it all, Bear Family does have a boxed set of his complete Decca recordings available, but for most people, I recommend the now out of print ""From The Original Master Tapes"" and ""Greatest Hits"" collections over this skimpy collection which is all that MCA has in print right now."
3,Sub cable - does what it's supposed to,"It's a subwoofer cable, there isn't much to it. You could probably get one for less from some other online retailers, but I was replacing one that got taken out by lightning, so I wasn't paying."
3,OK I guess,"I think the information is good in this. The problem I have is that it is so boring. It would be nice if Brad was a little excited about playing guitar. He seems to have have come out of a band similar to the one in the Blues Brothers who were rescued from playing in a club inside a Holiday Inn. I cannot remember the name of the band but I think it was something like the Mellotones. Anyway, the information is good but it is really hard to sit through."
4,Good,"Not necessary holding your privy as described. Or, I don't really know how it wirks, not very comfy but the material and the fir are perfect."
5,Great boxer briefs ever,"C-IN2 Men's Underwear Sling Lo No Show Army TrunkThis is a awesome undie's,very soft fabric,nice fit,look good."
1,"Save your money, avoid C-in2, buy something well-made","Uncomfortable! Poor quality! Bad Customer Service! Nice box/advertising!I purchased 3 of these (different colors), never having owned this brand. I purchased from another online retailer, not Amazon. One had a tag that read ""Medium"" which didn't match the size on the box or the size ordered, which was ""Large"". Upon calling the online retailer all of their stock in the color ""gray"" was the same situation. Returned it and received a replacement pair, size ""Large"", which was significantly bigger than either of the other 2 pair which were supposed to be size ""Large"". I called C-in2 to express my dissatisfaction with the initial stock mix-up of all gray pair, received no response.Lastly, the ""sling"" advertised, sounds better in theory than it is. After a couple of minutes the sling gets uncomfortable, feels like a paper cut."
1,absolutley horrible,"the music sucks,no point except chopping heads off and rotting corpses(no lyrical meaning whatsoever)and the album cover is the most disgusting thing ive ever seen."
1,"Sure, I do like DM but...","...this band doesn't get my impression. From what I heard, some of the people hate this band and some others love it. Well, to point it out, this is the only DM band that I despise. Sure, their lyrics are sickening and funny but seeing that they have been around for a decade-and-a-half, all of their albums depict the same gory theme all over and over again. I will admit that George Fisher is actually a better vocalist than Chris Barnes. The only thing that the band impresses me is that they still play Metal. But gory themes and violence can get cliched real quick and Cannibal Corpse epitomizes that fact.I might as well stick to better DM bands like Suffocation, Death, Nile, and Malevolent Creation. I give this review a 1.5 out of 5 stars instead of 1."
1,Same ol',They should've disbanded and shot each other after 'Vile'.I listened to 5 seconds of one of the previews and thats all I needed to hear to never buy another Corpse album.
1,A sorry excuse for a band...,"Since this band begun? They have always sucked and will continue to suck...Cannibal corpse's ""wretched spawn"" is the dumb, tough guy brainless type of deathmetal that only posers can enjoy. You want talent? Listing to cryptopsy or necrophagist,decrepitbirth,dyingfetus, disgorge, and others. One cannibal corpse song sounds like all the rest and one more thing ? Their drummer is pathetic. Bye posers."
1,Eighth notes,"The only beauty/talent expressed in this album lies in the evenness and precision of their unflagging rhythms. Other than that what could possibly be special about this album? The singing is just a broadband set of frequencies that lacks dynamic, melodic and rythmic (the singing only emphasizes the basic pulse) sophistication. The lyrics are corny (BTW just look...look at the names of the tracks, Frantic Disembowelment for example). The guitar plays almost-as-uninteresting things (playing in phrygian all the time gets old). The tracks lack variety.I can see the general desire for angry music, but it should be seductive (I don't mean sexually), thus drawing people into it. The artists demonstrate a lack of understanding of music in general, theoretically and conceptually. Don't support filth like this. In three words - uninteresting, masturbatory hatred. Listening to this music will only make you a lesser person. You are not hard core for enjoying this, only tasteless."
5,Cannibal stronger than ever!!,"Up until I heard 'The Wretched Spawn', I was convinced that 'Bloodthirst' was Cannibal's best album. If anything, 'Wretched' is the album they should have made after 'Bloodthirst;' but the band released a safe album 'Gore Obsessed' in between both albums. 'The Wretched Spawn' takes the intensity of 'Bloodthirst' but adds more diversity in it's sound {hell they even have a what I call a ""death metal ballad"" w/ the song ""Festering in the Crypt;"" which happens to be my favorite track!) This is definitely the Corpse's best & most brutal work to date!! This one will be hard for the band to beat!!"
5,Cannibal Corpse at there Best!!!,"The new Cannibal Corpse album The Wretched Spawn is by far one of there best albums of all time. I have never really been a Cannibal fan for to long now. None of there past albums really moved me and got me into them. I don't know I was more into Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under and Deicide. Until I saw them Live. They are a great band if you guys ever get the chance to see them live and I alot got every members autographs which was very cool. So after the show, the next day I went out to best buy and bought the Wretched Spawn and I got into Cannibal Corpse. The new album is just great from top to bottom. It is worth every penny that you spent for it and it will blow your mind how fast and how brutal it is. All the songs on here are the best. So just go out there and F'n buy it."
3,Decent enough,"This cd pretty much is exactly like gore obsessed not musically, but how tiring it gets after awhile. i listened to it enough to give it a good chance. I love the cd, but after 6 or 7 times I really didnt want to listen to it anymore."
5,phenomenal-need to buy,"Last album I thought was just a one shot deal with Neil Kernon but lo and behold another spawn was awaiting me. This is even better than gore obsessed, live cannibalism and anything else they have done with Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes. This is absolutely the best death metal album I have ever heard. Every song is a winner on this disc, including the dvd which is a great introspection into the men who make up this band. The premier track though is Nothing Left To Mutilate whose beat thanks to Paul has been caught in my head since the album was released. I want to give kudos to everyone in this band for all that they have done to keep this type of music alive and for Corpsegrinder who is making his lyrics so discernible that I don't need the lyrics anymore."
1,"Sorry, but I enjoy music..","Anyone can mimic these pathetic ""riffs"" and drumbeats..It's utter nonsense: every song sounds exactly the same. Seriously I wouldn't be surprised if the military used this album for torture methods. The whole ""o we're so bad ass because we sing about death and gore"" is almost as horribly funny as the singer's so called ""vocals"". Bottom Line: listen to metal..not this trash."
4,"What puzzles me, is why EvilBrit2K3 is reviewing this.","Why would someone who listens to Korn and Mary Manson write a review, let alone, waste his time on talent such as this or any other great death metal band. Keep to your three-chord-wanna-be metal.Anyway, this is actually a surprise. Is it me, or do Cannibal seem to improve their musicianship on each album? I think so. It's also kind of interesting to see that they've slowed down the tempo a little bit on a few songs, which in turn, makes them heavy as a really heavy thing (lol). My only problem (again) is that the album lacks a bottom edge, mainly bass. So I hear that Neil Kernon has given us an album of potatoes (instead of meat and potatoes, the meat being the bass). Don't get me wrong, this album slays, but it's all trebble. They have improved their technicality and taken brutality to a new level. This album gets a thumbs up from me. Keep up the good work boys. L8r."
5,CANNIBAL'S COVER ART RULES,THIS CD IS EXCELLENT! WRETCHED SPAWN IS JUST ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS. I LIKE ALL OF THEM BUT WRETCHED SPAWN STANDS OUT TO ME. KEEP UP THE MASSACRE GUY'S.
1,Awful just Awful,This seriously is the worst thing ever not just in music but everything in general i cant believe there are five star reviews for this album and this band there album cover is disgusting and the song titles are stupidNow read my lips no more cannibal corpse there awful anyone who likes them thinks they are so hard core but really your just an idiot
1,cannibal corpse are losers,Why do people listen to this trash...Here is what deathmetal songs sound likeBLARH YAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GROOOOOO YAHHHH BLORG BLOGGRG GORE BLOOD YAHHH OOOO GOOOOO AYHHHHAnd they call this music.
3,well i know im gonna be hit up for this...,"ok im not going to say that these guys are bad because i dont have the cd and i cant judge people or artists that i dont know..so i gave it a three stars because i thought that there so called ""growls"" made me laugh so hard that i almost cried!!...i dont know much about death metal so im definatly not going to say that they dont know how to do it because its a hell of a lot better than i can do...soo i guess...if you like death metal try this out by the samples and if you like it...get it and if not...try other stuff...common sense people...im out"
1,Mediocre & boring =cannibal corpse.,"Why would any one into deathmetal apreciate people that only talk about eating other's ppl skin and the same type of idiotic subject matter over & over again ?If the music atleast made up for the dumb & childish lirycs. Cannibal corpse, is the same thing as plenty of rapmetal bands and nu-metal bands out today and no there not difirent in any way--just because they play their music faster and heavier...Whatever! Its basically the same sound over and over and over redone again and again. Truly boring as any thing can get and no its not heavy or nothing of the sort, trust me!I didn't even like cc when Chris barnes used to be in the band--- because he sucks at being a deathmetal vocalist. Any one that likes deathmetal and yet love cc should be ashamed of themselfes. No talent here...Skip this and insted check out vomitory,immolation,skinless,gorerotted,mortician,behemoth,vehemence--- just to name a few amazing deathmetal acts."
5,"YES, FINALLY","Let me preface this by dedicating it Bill O'Reilly. What are all the ""hatuz"" griping about. They could gripe about my grammer, seeing as I ended that last sentence with improper punctuation, or the fact that I spelled ""grammar"" wrong (I'm sure one spelling is correct). But no, they pick on Cannibal Corpse. Cannibal Corpse is awesometastic. My Chemical Crap-mance doesn't hold a corporate candle to Cannibal Corpse whatsoever. To conclude: BEST COVER ART EVER!!! Check out the doozy for Tomb of the Mutilated."
3,WRETCHED PRODUCTION,"The songs are great, the artwork is great, and Cannibal Corpse is great. I've been a fan for seven years and own most everything they have done, and I think that some of the best songwriting in death metal came from Gore Obsessed. They are also the tightest live band I've ever seen. But ever since they've been recording with Brian Slagel, their production has sounded like garbage. I really had my fingers crossed that they wouldn't be working with this guy again for this project. Let's put it this way... Sadness will Prevail by Today is the Day sounds better than this. Maybe my hearing is gone, but the Wretched Spawn sounds to me like a TIN CAN. Please find this band a new engineer. Now GO BUY IT!! Along with ""Deleted Symphony for the Beaten Down"" by Soilent Green."
2,Not very interesting for the most part,"I bought this book based on a recommendation of a classmate. This book does have some, keyword, some, hilarious personal Hells but, those are few and far between."
5,YOUR gripes and grousings...but elevated by humor,"In the hands of humorists, all those things that really get under your skin suddenly take on a new life--an amusing one, that doesn't sound like whining! I found most of my personal pet peeves: the cashier that puts the receipt in your palm, then the bills, and then the change, so that there's no way you can put any of that in your pocket or purse before the groceries or the change spills. The dreary terror of little league baseball. Children's choirs. Leaf blowers. You name it, it's here. ... Is this an important book? Well, it's important to laugh at these little things so the really big things you can't do anything about don't get the best of you! It's 101 examples of smart thinking about our dumbest things."
2,It will have to do,"We were decorating our ""recreation room"" with movie posters from some of our favorite movies. But we didn't have room for full size posters. I ordered this mini-poster and it is not the best representation of the movie. If you love ""Funny Farm"", get a full sized poster that is based on the original movie theater release."
5,Locking Extension,"After getting these extensions, I have used them multiple times. I have yet to have a socket fall of the extension without first sliding the collar to release it. These extensions are among the best I have used over the years. I had a hard time buying them though. It seems S&K is under re-organization, and right now it is hard to purchase a good number of their tools, these extensions included. I hope they get their problems resolved, as they do make good quality tools."
1,disappointing,"The characters in this book are hopelessly unfocused and unappealing. The portrayals left me disgusted with them all. Brianna is basically stupid, despite being described repeatedly as very intelligent. Clayton is a self-centered jerk. The aunt is a cardboard cut-out. The villain just about twirled his mustache. Everyone close to the hero and heroine was deliriously (unrealistically) happy in their marriages, but the central characters insisted that they could not possibly find happiness in a partner. I could not begin to believe the spy-story subplot. I managed to read almost half of the book before giving up and skipping to the end to see if it ever got better. It did not.I generally enjoy light Regency romances, and am not particularly demanding of them. I've read variations of this basic plot that worked nicely. However, the characterizations, dialog, and plot just didn't work for me."
3,Convenient Bride,"When Clayton needs a wife in less than a month, Brianna, a scholarly young lady who has had a crush on him forever, would seem to be the perfect choice. However, Brianna has greater matters on her mind, such as saving the Prince. Rejection only makes Clayton more determined and desperate. How can a simple young girl withstand such passion? She can't.This is, I admit, a lightweight read, but Brianna is a more complex character than the average Regency heroine. Take a mental break and indulge in something sweet and simple like this.Amanda Killgore"
5,good book,"this was a good book, i like reading teresa mccarthy books. i can't wait to read the next series book."
3,the convenient bride.,Good story line. Not much suspense as to ending. Held my interest anyway and so I continued on and read other books in series.
5,Very good replacement product for APC UPS 1500RM!,"My works APC UPS 1500 recently had a battery go bad in it(battery actually started to leak:/) So I went to the manufacturers site, talked to a rep, who sent me a link to the replacement battery for my specific product. Needless to say, they wanted over $400. So I researched further into it and found this battery made by American Battery Co. that was almost a fourth of the price. I was sold once I saw the price difference and that this battery was made in America:). It arrived yesterday and I just now got to install it in the UPS today, perfect fit, and the batteries say Leak Proof;). Its charging now:)5/5 stars so far!"
4,Connectors an issue as other have mentioned,As others have mentioned the connectors are not quite right and were loose/intermittent. Plugging it in even pushed one the UPS side connectors out of place inside the UPS side plug. I dissembled the UPS to access and fix the UPS side connector. Then I pulled the wiring harness out of the old battery cage and replaced the wiring harness in this new cage with the old one. Everything is working fine now.
1,Did not work in APC unit.,"These ABC batteries would not charge in my APC unit. I contacted APC tech support and they said you need APC brand batteries. I asked if they guaranteed that was the problem and they said yes. They were right. APC brand works, ABC does not. Spend extra and get the brand name."
1,"Poor fit, bad connection","We were hoping to save a few hundred dollars by buying this instead of an APC battery but it did not fit correctly, the adapter kept detaching, and the battery meter kept rising and falling. Had to return it."
3,Check out the size,I just received this item and haven't had a chance to try it.I just wanted to warn others to carefully check out the size. This pan is much smaller than a standard metal angel food pan. The description does says that it is 7 1/4 by 3 1/4.SiliconeZone does make a larger pan that Amazon carries in yellow and it is 10 x 4 for only $2 more.
3,Dont Order!,I ordered this set because of the value and the handsome historic pattern. When I opened my first box I had a shattered bowl. You cannot order seperate pieces so I had to pack up the entire box and ship it back. When I got my next box it had a shattered plate. I had already donated my other dinner dishes so I was stuck with a broken set. When I contacted Amazon and asked for a remedy or a replacement I was given a $10.00 gift certificate and left hanging. Later they contacted me and said they would not split up sets and that they had so many broken sets returned that they could not replace or ship me any more dinnerware. If you want good china go to the store. Do not trust Amazon you will regret it.
4,A Must have,I ordered the Johnsson brother historic america dinner set service for 4 around christma time. I absolutely love it. It is very unique and very classy. The design has a very warm feeling . My mom loved it too but when I purchased it in december it was only 25.99 and now its 59.99 I wish it would go down again so i can buy one for my mom as well
3,"Nice Cd, difficult to find","Nice Cd, today is very difficult to find, for this reason is one of the most wantedJohn Williams works with the Boston Pops."
4,Dudley Moore shines as the storyteller!,"I used to love watching Dudley Moore on the late night talk shows. Listening to him tell his funny, witty stories was always so entertaining, so I thought I might enjoy hearing him tell the story of Peter and the Wolf. I can definitely say I was not disappointed, as his witty humor did truly shine through on this CD. It was most enjoyable to hear this age old story interpreted by him. I still find myself laughing every time I listen to it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars has to do with a sound problem. The story of Peter and the Wolf seems to have been recorded at a different decibel level than the Nutcracker Suite portion, so I always have to turn the volume up or down, depending upon the portion to which I am listening."
2,It's to wide,"I bake a lot of bread, in fact I have not bought bread for over a year now. I bought this item as I was looking for a great non-stick produc and it is! However that's where my appreciation for this product ends.I think it's actually dangerous to put this product into a hot oven because it's too flexible. I'm afraid I will burn myself as it flexes so I don't use it very often. **Update, after using this for some time now I'm used to the flexing & it doesn't concern me as much as it did in the beginning.Additionally, the pan is so wide that I'm not happy with the height of the loaf. The width makes toasting difficult & sometimes the slices will not fit into a sandwich size bag. If you happen to make very large loaves, then perhaps this is the pan for you."
2,Inaccurate,"I was surprised (and very disappointed) with the numerous inaccuracies throughout this movie. Anyone who has done even a little research will immediately question this movie, especially since it is supposed to be the REAL story of Laura Ingalls Wilder."
2,Beyond Prairie,"If you are a fan of the original TV series, this movie will be long and dragged out and a little boring."
1,Warning: DVD-R,"This is a fantastic film, Zeman is a brilliant filmmaker, but this is a DVD-R being sold as a DVD. Don't get scammed."
3,Inexplicably fun,"This movie seems to be based on Jules Verne's novel of the same title - but I'm not sure, since so few thematic elements correspond between the two. Title mostly. The original seemed to be a more or less political parade of nationalistic stereotypes, but this is some vapid romance. With dinosaurs.Then, this has the charmingly cheesy sense of a silent flick, with poorly painted props and backgrounds, and with pieces of plot inane beyond belief. (As if that general wouldn't have moved the desk the third or fourth time bits of ceiling collapsed onto it.)But, it's fun. It you like the earnest but silly character of the 1930s Buck Rogers movies (and I do), this has a lot the same flavor, but with just enough anachronisms to pin it to the turn of the decade from 1960s to 70s. Goofy, but fun.-- wiredweird"
2,Silver trumpet,"Kind of depressing. There are so many negative things that happen in the book, that the one positive thing at the end hardly makes up for the bad stuff."
5,True Story...Gripping!,Its a true story of how she saved herself and her daughter....something she thought she'd never have to do! Great Movie! Sally Field was awesome in it!
4,Delivery,The product reached me quicker than I thought it would. It was a gift for a friend so I haven't watched it.
4,Present for my mother,I bought this as a present for my mother. She really loves Sally Field and she enjoyed this movie a lot.
4,One of the best and most meaningful movies I have ever seen.,This movie is one of the best. Its a must see. It had a good plot and maed me want to get emotionaolly envolved with the movie. The actors were great and I commend Sally Field for doing this movie. I also belive that it shos a very good and realistic view of the difference between cultures in Iran and The United States.
4,what contraversy,I REALLY CANNOT BELIEVE ALL THE ACCLAMATIONS AS WELL AS ANNOYANCES FOR THIS REAL LIFE STORY OF A REAL WOMAN'S STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT AS A MOTHER CUSTODY OF HER DAUGHTER. FIRST OFF SALLY FIELD BEING THE EXTRODINARY ACTOR THAT SHE IS PORTRAYED BETTY BEAUTIFULLY. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OF THIS FILM CAUSING SOME PEOPLE DISMAY BUT THIS IS A REAL LIFE STORY AND ONE MUST HAVE RESPECT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF RISKING THE LOSS OF HER CHILD BECAUSE HER HUSBAND DECIDED TO LEAVE THE U.S. WHO DESERVES AS A PARENT TO CHOOSE A LIFE AS A PRISONER JUST TO KEEP PEACE AT HOME. IT WAS A WELL DONE MOVIE AND WELL WORTH WATCHING.
1,incomplete,"Not a very good movie at all. I read the book, enjoyed it and thought I'll enjoy the movie just as well, but I was very dissapointed! It's been made for holywood purposes, very weak performances, incomplete to the point that if you hadn't read the book you will not know what's happening, new characters pop up out of nowhere, without any explanation who they are and what they're doing there. Having read the book I understood what was happeing but otherwise one could get confused. Also parts of the movie were not true to the book. Eg. the escape in the car was nothing like what was in the book!! I'd say read the book and then watch the movie, or skip the movie all together, it's a waste of almost 2 hours."
1,Innacurate,"This movie is outrageously innacurate and it's hard to believe the extent people can go to, just to make money. I feel I wasted my time watching it - Iran is NOT as depicted."
1,"Why ""Not Without my Daughter"" fails to get my approval.","I feel disgusted at the fact that I wasted two hours of my life to watch such inaccurate rubbish that lacks any real value. The director attempts to convince us (the viewer) that Iranians are violent people who live in a medieval society engulfed with animosity. In addition, the director attempts to convince us that Iranian husbands roam the streets of Tehran and legally beating up their wives. Hence, the viewer is expected to believe that 2500 years of Iranian history becomes generalized in a two hour account. Maybe the director should take a visit to Iran and see for himself how flawed his so-called movie really is. But hey, its show business remember? We can make a few easy bucks these days at the cost of besmirching an entire people. Right?"
1,Why onla for the US??,I live in germany and I have the video and looked everywhere for the dvd.I love this film but why is it only for the US market???I am very disappointed about that.
1,other side of the story,"I wish I had a chance to read the other side of the story from Dr. Mahmoody (Betty's hausband). From what I heard, I can imagine that it's much different.I cannot judge Dr. Mahmoody neither I can believe this movie, unless I read his story as well."
1,Pathetic glorification of a kidnappper,"This is the rhird worst big budget film I have ever seen ( but unlike in the others that rate so low the acting was not really an issue.) Just imagin, for a moment, if you can pry open those tiny little minds, if things were the other way around and a person from other culture was trying to kidnapp thier child to take them 'home' to china, irano, or whereever. It is a crime, pure and simple. Take a glance at an I-485 sometime (application for adjustment of status to legal permanent residency in the U.S) and you will see that the U.S. ( other than hollywood when the victim is from another country) does not take such crime lightly no matter how much a mindless audience may cheer."
1,Like racist movies? Get it!,How can you stereotype 70 millions Iranian people because of this one case? That's ridiculous. This movie is something for the uneducated redneck.
5,Will make you cry!,"Beware! This movie is a TEARJERKER! (even for men!) The struggle the main character has to go through with the sudden change of her husband is astonishing, compelling, and full of a fire to live and escape. Not for younger kids, too high of an emotional scale. A great picture of how life has been (and still is) for these kinds of people."
3,"Good movie, but doesn't paint whole picture","I read the book before I saw the movie and thought that the movie portrayed the book story pretty well. Betty's story is pretty harrowing of how an American woman flees Iran with her daughter. It is informative in that it tells viewers about conditions in other places, such as Iran. But one must remember when watching this that this is not everyday occurance and Iranian and Muslim men don't all treat their women like slaves and captives. Don't form your opinions of this society based upon this movie."
5,Good,Sally Field is excellent in this movie. I like movies about real people and this one is very good.
3,There Are Two Sides to Every Story,"This movie sure has stirred up controversy. I have read the book to which was actually a bit better. Some people on here say it's true, some say no. I strongly urge everybody interested in the story of the ""Mahmoody"" family to watch the documentary ""Without My Daughter"" which tells the story of Dr. Bozorg Mahmoody, Betty's husband, who has been robbed of the right to even see his daughter and publicly and globally humiliated and criminalized. This movie demonstrated what extremes people will go to when they feel trapped."
1,Not Without My Daughter - don't rent it,"Whilst sitting in my world cultures class one day shortly before Christmas break, our teacher explained that there would be a project due when we returned. *collective groan* the assignment was to watch this movie and write a summary report. I was wary at first, and soon found that this feeling was justified. Throughout most of this film the actions of the characters are either overplayed, or drawn out and boring. What looks like a plot twist at first, becomes a staple for the movie, happening again and again, until it can no longer be classified as a plot twist. At risk of sounding uninteligent, I'd say the best word to describe this film is just ""silly""."
3,"Nice movie, but does not stay true to the book.","After seeing this movie for a class my freshman year of high school, a few years later I decided to watch it again AND buy the book....First off, the book is so much more dramatic than the movie (even though the movie attempts to do so). Sure, a picture (and a movie for that matter) is worth a thousand words, if you want the real story, then you're better off reading the book.I must admit, the acting was rather good in this movie. Sally Field and Alfred Molina were convincing as an American trapped in a seemingly primitive society and a man torn between family and his American way of life (respectively).However, I still think the book is much more better. Betty Mahmoody's personal account of all the abuse and suffering during her year in Iran is more effective than the movie's exaggerating, over-the-top screenplay."
5,Great movie!!!!!!!,This movie is a movie of courage and true love. Sally Fields played a AWESOME part in this movie. I really recomoend it!!!
2,too much ado about marital problems,"this whole story is the result of a marriage gone bad. the story of a depressed, confused husband and a stubborn, unsympathic wife. what happened to Betty M. has nothing to do with Islam and women, but everything to do with inflexibility of both the husband and the wife and their lack of commitment to their marriage. ultimately Betty M. seizes the opportunity to make a lot of money by trashing a people and their culture. and Hollywood seizes the opportunity to trash Islam as a whole. Betty M. doesn't say anything good about Iran even though she holds on dearly to her beautiful Persian carpets. the two stars go Sally Field for her portrayal of the protagonist, i only hope she did not believe it all! Betty M. doesn't look anything like Sally Field. by the way i suggest that ""Betty"" changes her last name since it's an islamic word!"
1,"Terribly written, played and directed.... Inaccurate and misleading","While I do understand the personal pain suffered by the real character of the story, Betty, I do not understand the real motive behind the story which shows Iranians as bunch of inhumane savages. Yes, Islamic Iran is no paradise and it is awful but the depiction of it the way it is shown in this movie is inaccurate and offensive. I won't give more than one star to this movie. Again, I do not expect much from Hollyweird. Hollywood is full of clueless morons."
1,Don't Watch This Movie / I Wish There Was A 0 Star,"It was amazing to me how inaccurately this movie depicted Iran and its people. I was also sickened by how little Betty, and the movie makers, appeared to know about Persian culture. DO NOT waste your time watching such a biased movie! Go to Iran, or visit an Iranian household, and you'll find yourself surrounded by warm, loving people -- not monsters. Or, if you really want to watch this movie, remember not to link it to the face of an Iranian to a kidnapper's. Thanks a lot, Betty."
5,Where was the Oscar for Sally Field's Performance?,Where was the Oscar for Sally field's performance? I still don't know why? Sally Field has always been one of my favorite actress. I think this is the best work she has done to date. Well done Sally Field.... fantastic performance indeed!I give ***** stars for this movie.
2,Encourages false beliefs on islam and its practices BIAS,"Sally Field is very convincing as an actress and surely, Brian Gilbert a good director. However, I'm amazed by the review of the Amazon. If this this movie shows a particular experience lived by a particular person, how comes that this is generalized to islam and islamic practices. It's a shame for the Amazon by the subjective approach of Leonard Maltin's guide. He seems to fall prey to the facility of degrading ISLAM,(""she has no right as a women, a mother or a wife"") which is a way of life of millions have chosen to adopt and more by saying something which is completly false and bias."
3,Entertaining,"I thought this was an intersting account of one woman's story. Nothing more, nothing less. Sally Field turned in a good performence as usual. Do women have diminished roles in the middle east when compared to western culture?-Of course-but that dosn't mean I think that this kind of situation is the norm. ..."
1,This movie is full of misleading and wrong info.about Islam.,"Hi. I have seen the whole movie. I really have to say that this movie's director didn't care and search for the true information about Islamic laws. So you dear viewers, I am not going to tell you, oh please don't see the movie, it is bad. What I ask you to do is to go and search your selves for the correct info. I found out that islam.org is a good source to learn about Islam. and it is free."
1,Terrible,"As an Iranian, I found this movie ridiculous in its depiction of anything to do with Iran. I was not offended until I came here and read comments about a ""strange country and culture"" and that this movie serves as a ""warning to women considering marrying a foreign man."" These views really show the damaging effect an ethnocentric and highly inaccurate movie like this can have. How would you feel if the story of Elian Gonzales were made into ""Not Without my Son"" (shot in Mexico perhaps) depicting America as a villainous society where the government and people deprive a father of his son? This would be just as realistic a portrayal of America as Not Without My Daughter is of Iran. It shocks me how some people buy into xenophobic portrayals of other cultures without critical intuition."
2,Unbalanced and Distorted,"This movie does not play fair with its Muslim characters. If a movie of such a vitriolic and spiteful nature were to be made in America about any other ethnic group, it would be denounced as racist and prejudiced.What is noteworthy is that she acknowledges the Iranians who helped her out of that situation. In fact, they were the only ones who bothered while the American government, the state department remained detached from the situation.'"
1,Israeli made movie: It explains itself,"This movie was produced and filmed in Israel. The actors (except Sally F. ) are Israelis. Its total waste of time since not one ounce of reality is in the picture. Its a biased account of one angry woman who has made millions off of her so called ""anguish"". It seems her anguish has made her lots of money!! How strange?! The donkeys roaming the streets would never be seen in Tehran. Only in the streets of Tel Aviv. Sum it up: Waste of time to watch and even worse is to talk about it."
1,Hollywood racism and exploitation,"Like True Lies and The Siege, this film is yet another studio attempt to exploit fear of Iran and the Middle East in general to sell videos; only here, it's worse. This film is marketed as a completely factual story, an insult to the intelligence of the viewing population. The makers of the film have presented a ridiculously narrow picture of Iranian culture, and assume that viewers will actually believe that every Iranian is a fanatical bent on stealing children away from their mothers. And Sally Field isn't even that good."
5,Masterpiece by the Master!!,"I have been a fan of Mc Stevie Hyper D since back in 97' when I heard him rip up the mic on a mixtape. Later on we all know he died in 98' from an undiagnosed heart condition. Mc Stevie was the top of his game. He left a gap in jungle music that will never be filled. This cd shows Mc Stevie's versatility on the mic, from mc'ing to actual singing. All these tracks have stood the test of time even though jungle changes so often as we all know. This cd ranges from ""rollers"" to ""two step"" to""jump-up"" to ""hip-hop jungle"". All the tracks feel fresh. So if you are a""tru junglist"" You should definately pic this one up. He shows why he was the best.R.I.P. Mc Stevie Hyper DIf you can find it pick it up because its rare.I had been looking for it for several years with no luck and when I would find it, was out of stock or they did not have it anymore. But I'm glad I was able to get my hands on a copy of this masterpiece. definately recomend it.Later"
2,Heavy-Duty Auto Jumper Cables - 20-Ft Length - Heavy 4-Gauge Copper,The product description is Heavy-Duty Auto Jumper Cables - 20-Ft Length - Heavy 4-Gauge Copper but the word copper should be in quotes. This is aluminum wire.
4,Good product,Best price for a 20ft cable. It worked very well to jump start my car. Would have liked rubberized grip though.
4,Cable is nice,Cable is long and work very well. The only I wish they provide bag for this product or some kind of case to store.
3,Review,"Heavy-Duty Auto Jumper Cables - 20-Ft Length - Heavy 4-Gauge Copper WireJumper Cables In Great Shape, Cast busted"
1,Really low Quality 8 or 9 Gauge Cables.NOT 4 Gauge.,"At first feel these cables appear heavy.Upon closer examination the rubber insulation is thick and heavy but the wire instead of being .236"" in diameter it is less than half that size at only .115"" in diameter.And so will only have half the current load carrying capacity of Real 4 Gauge Cables.This is false advertising.On top of that the alligator clips are so thin they tend to bend and distort when you try to open them.Made in China.Mine are being returned."
2,Not 4 gauge wire,"I wish I'd read the reviews instead of just looking at the overall rating. I have some 6 gauge wire, and I compared that to these cables, and the copper strands in this cable are smaller than the 6 gauge I have, so I think it's 8 gauge at best. It'll start your car in most cases, it's only under pretty extreme conditions that it would make a difference, but if you buy 4 gauge that's what you should get. On the plus side, it came with a decent zippered case."
5,"The Haj, by Leon Uris!","This is a fast paced historical page-turner on the Middle East. It is an intimate revlation of ancient and current Israeli and Arab values and cultures. It takes you to another world and a greater understanding of the actions and motives of both anncient and current day Jews and Arabs.This fascinating fiction is based closely on historical incidents and is more fact than fiction. I would recommend this book, particularly at this time in our history, as necessary reading for anyone over the age of 12 who wants to express an informed opinion on the Middle East."
5,Haj is good,"This book was great from cover to cover. I'll admit I was interested in the subject matter before reading, but it was unexpectedly great. The colorful characters are diverse and inspiring. The historical aspects made sense and really gave me a fuller understanding of Israeli-Arab relations before during and after Israel's independence. Leon Uris really detailed a richness of the arab/palestinian culture in a very respectful and understanding way and added to my understanding of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the seeds were planted many years ago."
4,Great read!,"It's amazing how little has changed in thirty years and the book reveals it. Some of the work reminds me of his other book, Exodus. Good writer."
4,Crazy People,I enjoyed the book learning about the mindset of Middle Eastern people. Now I believe even more that they are crazy to live the way they do.
5,Israel and Palestine - Wake Up!,"My dentist just read this and recommended it. It was great. I thought the character development of the two villages next to each other, Arab and Jewish, was a microcosm view of what is happening there. I was in Israel in 2011 and this helped to put a lot of what I saw into perspective. a great read."
3,Really?,"Although fairly well written and readable, this is a book about the founding of Israel from the Arab point of view that is comparable to a story of the Indian wars from the Native American viewpoint authored by George Armstrong Custer."
3,Great Book !!! But biased......,I picked up this book after reading Exodus & Mila 18 by the same author. In The Haj i hoped to get the Arab point of view on Arab-Israeli conflict. But this book simply portrays Jewish viewpoint of this conflict from Arab eyes.Ibrahim the father of the hero of this book is damn sure that Jews are gonna win on the partition night (well i'll give ya a 100 bucks if u show me an Arab who thot he was gonna lose).Deir Yassin for instance the author tells the village was very much anti-Jew and many of the Hussieni's warriors were from that village. But infact Deir Yassin was a neutral village. This book demonises A.K Husseini & Abdullah while glorifies Yishuv. The book fails to show tha Arabs too did have their own victories while at one point of time Arabs had more or less successfully screwed the Jews in Jerusalem...Read O Jerusalem for a neutral view
1,One sided writing,"""Racist"" is the only word that leaps out of the pages of this novel. If you loved Exodus, this novel will probably shock you as to how low Leon Uris can stoop to. Over 500 pages of declaring over and over again ""Arabs are barely human beings, Jews are the only worthwhile human beings""."
3,GET A GRIP FOLKS!,"THIS IS HISTORICAL FICTION.. A NOVEL!!! Not unlike Herman Wolks ""Winds of War"" or War and Rememberance."
1,"Not ""accurate"" at all.","When I first read this book, I was solidly pro-Israel. But even so, my instinct told me that there was no way that the Palestinian Arabs are as violent and stupid as Uris portrayed them.Furthermore, if by chance the Arabs are actually as violent and stupid as claimed, then the Jews have shown themselves incredibly stupid for having settled amongst them and let themselves be surrounded by them.So, ironically, the book made the Jews look worse than what Uris probably intended when he wrote it."
2,Way to depressing,"So many words that don't help a plot. I always finish a book,absolutely could not wade trough this one. It did make you aware of the fact they are probably never going to let their hatred go. Did let you know a lot of the very depressing culture."
5,Read it,"Probably slanted but a good story that follows history realisticly. Leon Uris is one of my favorites, he writes a good novel."
3,"Very good story, but biased to some degree","Leon Uris never pretended to be an ""objective"" observer. He is Israeli and writes from Israeli perspective. Given that, this book is less biased than his other books, like ""Exodus"". It is a *very* engaging and suspenseful story. I could not put it down from start to end. This quality alone compensates a great deal of his lack of ""objectivity"". In the final analysis, many of his negative points about Arabs are more-or-less true, especially as things were back in 1948. I still like this book even though it is more biased towards the Israeli side than the ""pure objective"" book would be."
5,an accurate portrayal of palestinian arabs,"the last 20 years has seen the palestinian arab cause become politcally correct. News reporters have focussed on the ""harsh israeli occupation"" of the ""poor palestinain victims"", creating a TV worlview where palestinians can do no wrong and Israelis can do no right. The world has forgotten the countless acts of terrorism and pure hatred directed towards the Jews by the palestinian arabs. reading this book rips away all the pro palestinian propoganda and reveals a shocking reality of the history of the arab war against the Jews. Im sure hanan Ashrawi hates this book!"
2,Blatant bias leads to disappointment,"I enjoy fiction based in a historical setting because it is entertaining but also educational. The Haj was entertaining, the story moved well, the charactors were interesting and it gave a acute perspective on the life of a Palestinian refugee and the struggle for survival. As a book of fiction it was a interesting read. However, Uris' description of the Arab's way of living, from the very negative description of Islam and of Arab family values left me disappointed. His descriptions were so negative that there accuracy clearly came into question. As a result I began to question the whole integrity of the book from a historical perspective which diminished my enjoyment significantly. I am now hesitating reading another Uris book because I don't want to have a similar experience, particularly when there are many other authors to choose from."
5,Great novel and very enlightning,"Many of the reviews I read believe the author to be biased or even racist. While I cannot disprove those assertions, I must say that I came away from this wonderful story with a much better understanding of the problems in the mideast and specifically the plight and frustrations of the Palestinians. It is always dificult to know where facts end and fiction begins or indeed overlap. I believe Uris does a tremendous job of blending the two."
3,"If You Want An Arab Viewpoint, Read An Arab Author","From the author who once wrote of a character that despite his enlgihtenment, he was still an Arab (Exodus p. 227) and also of ""the unscrupulous ethics of the Arab"" (229), comes a purported attempt -- with a straight face -- to tell ""the Arab side"" of the Middle East conflict. If you want to learn the Arab side -- right or wrong -- check out an Arab author. Still, Uris can put together a readable yarn so enjoy. But don't take it seriously as the Arab characters are literary analogues of Stepin' Fetchit"
3,Bad view of Arab Muslims.,I agree with John Grace. Uris' depiction of an Arab muslim family and way of life is incorrect and wrong. True muslims are not as barbaric and stupid as Uris has portrayed. This is obviously a blatant attempt to slur Islam.
2,A book written with a poison pen ...,"Unecessarily & unrealistically divides people into good-guys and bad guys. I read this book after having spent a year on an Israeli kibbutz. A Finnish friend said of Uris's style: "".. if [Uris] wasn't biased, his story wouldn't be exciting"". I wonder if that's what Uris had in mind while hammering out ""Exodus"" and ""The Haj"". **PS: Any of my Kibbutz buddies out there? It's ""Harry"" aka ""Ren"" and ""Harendra"" from Zimbabwe. I live in Australian now."
1,Sadly biased and offensive to the arab culture,"It is sad to see so much bias and propaganda against the arab culture. Not only this book degrades the arab culture and religion, it also potrays the jewish culture as so advanced and open-minded... when both are so untrue.I cannot judge for the historical facts mentioned in the story, but I can say that although the fiction part of the story is good, it is very poorly written."
3,Fact & fiction blurred,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Excellent narrative with great character development. However, the commentary on muslims/arabs is difficult to digest for several reasons:1. The author is harsh with the description of haj's people and cohorts and rarely discerns muslim and arab culture and tradition.2. Jewish people are never mentioned with a derogatory note. They are noble throughout the exhaustive narrative.I read this book during a time period overlapping the 9/11 incident and am wary of this tainting my opinion of Muslim/Arab people."
2,Author can't decide on a style,"The characters in the book couldn't seem to decide whether they were highly stylized larger (or smaller) than life characters and that resulted in poor understanding of what the author was trying to say. I didn't get it. I enjoyed the book until what seemed like the author just lost interest, and found an ending with no meaning. I am going to read another Uris novel and see if there is a thread."
3,Hate literature from a major publisher no less.,"Write a book in which you describe an entire religion and ethnic group as hateful and hate-filled. Then, try finding a mainstream publisher to publish you. Hard? Not if you are Leon Uris and writing about the inherent villainy of Arabs and Muslims. That's the story of the Haj."
4,The Haj,As usual Leon Uris paints the main characters so well we can almost know what they will do in a certain situation. Then he twists things around. The is a great story about the Palenstinian life before and after the formation of the Israeli nation and the choices that had to be made. Please read. You will not only be entertained but will be informed.
5,Arab Misfortunes,"Uris's portrayl of the indignaties, and brutality,inflicted on the Bedouins and Arab populations in general by their Muslim rulers and leaders who reside in the Palestine area is breathtaking.The tribal family relationship engenders a total dependence on their Muktars.We are truly indoctrinated by Uris's novel into the life style of existance exemplified in the ""Haj"".One should not neglect to read this novel.It is a true educational need to understand the Middle East historical attitudes relative to the lives and fortunes of the so-called Palestinians and The State of Israel."
4,"Every Landlords legal guide, eighth edition","Havent had a chance to go through the entire book; expect I will refer to it when I have a need to do so. It seems quite thorough, though maybe not laid out in a user friendly style as it could be."
1,Unuseable PDF forms,"This book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a CD with numerous forms, the Word documents are very useful. The PDF forms are not. The problem is none of them are editable. Why even include them? Why not creat them in Word format? This is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time. Why even provide the forms electronically if you can't customize them, you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them."
5,Great Resource,"This is the book you probably wished you had before your current tenants moved in. If you're stuck with bad tenants, this book will guide you in legally dealing with them and making the most of the situation. (It even gives advice if you think your tenants are terrorists or drug dealers). This book will also help you in screening potential tenants to get better ones next time.This is one of those rare, informative books that you will want to read from cover to cover.NOTE: The included CD-Rom has more than 30 forms and works with both PC's and Mac's. (Though Mac users will not receive technical support from Nolo)."
4,Great for landlords and tenants!,"As a long-time tenant, I've dealt with a broad range of property issues. Broken windows, poor heating, broken appliances...the list runs the gamut. While I opt to fix as much as I can, I turned to this book when I wanted more information regarding my rights and responsibilities as a tenant. It wisely guides the reader through legalese and presents important legal information in an easy-to-read style that non-lawyers can truly appreciate. It is, of course, an excellent guide for landlords as well, from buying the property to managing, evicting and dealing with problem tenants. Great for either side, it's more than just a handy reference-it's an essential tool no landord (or tenant!) should be without."
4,"It's NOLO, it's solid; have it available","I want to write, ""I wish I'd thought to look at this book earlier..."" but I'll survive. As my agent says, ""the school of real estate is a hard teacher.""Chapter after chapter of advice and information about what to do under situations I'd never imagined. I'll keep looking and learning. A fair amount of the information is for landlords of multi-tenant properties, some with on-site management.For those aspects of property management that can't be accurately summed up by ""take care of your building and don't be stupid,"" this book is a great resource. If you're not sure about the second part of that summation, read the book first."
3,"Nice beginning, but beware of state law!","This book gives you a good first overview, but you absolutely have to get a book on your state's regulations as well, especially if you live in a highly regulated state like Massachusetts. This book for example only gives you a vague idea on how to handle the security deposit, but Massachusetts state law is very specific and not following the rules precisely may cost you the deposit plus penalties."
5,Pleasing to the Eyes,This book is well worth the price. A great gift for anyone in the Navy or retired from the Navy. I bought this book as a gift for my brother for graduating from Naval bootcamp and he was really impressed. The hardcover of this book is undescribeable.
2,"The Navy, Book","The book was supposed to be new. It was dented on the top, not really clean, had a price tag of $12.00 on the inside of it. I was not impressed at all and I sure didn't want to give it as a gift because you could tell that it was used. I will never buy a book from here again. Why do people say that something is new when its NOT... Was very disappointed."
2,80's Brit-pop for Hard-core Madness Fans Only!,"By this time, Suggs and the boys have moved almost completely away from ska and are indulging in high-brow Brit-pop. As a fan, you are disappointed with the lack of rock-steady beats but you have to admire their attempt to strike out in a new style. Unfortunately, they miss more than they hit but memorable tunes like ""Victoria Gardens"", ""Michael Caine"" and ""Wings of A Dove"" make it a worth while listen. If you love Madness' quirky style and can live without the ska , pick up this CD. Hey, you can't beat it for $6.97!"
1,Beware the 12-track abridged version!,"Be careful! The 2000 reissue of Madness's classic CD ""Keep Moving"" omitted two tracks from the original (""Wings of a Dove ""and ""Sun and the Rain"") and shuffled the play order of the others.Make certain you're getting the 14-track version of this CD or risk missing two classic Madness songs. The 14-track CD is still available, so buy carefully!"
4,"Disappointment, then pleasantly surprised","I just received my copy of Madness' ""Keep Moving"" CD, which has been a favorite of mine since the days of vinyl. I was disappointed to note that the CD only contained 12 tracks instead of 14, and that two of my favorite songs on the CD had been omitted (""The Sun and The Rain"" and ""The Wings of a Dove"").While listening to the disk on my computer I discovered that the CD included 4 video tracks, including the two omitted from the CD. It's still great music, and it's fun to see the videos."
3,Not top quality...,But they did get the job done. I used them to tie some wireless headphones to my TV system so I could listen whether or not the sound system was muted. I had to wiggle them a bit to get a good connction.
1,Only Heats When Folded in Fours,"This ""thick and cozy"" electric blanket is anything but. Even on its highest setting this flimsy blanket barely puts out any heat.I found the instructions amusing. They state, ""if it seems the blanket isn't heating, gently fold it into fours and slip your hand beneath the folds. You'll feel the warmth of the working blanket."" It's a bit like being told to stick your hand in a toaster after it fails to toast your bread. Apparently any bit of heat this blanket produces qualifies it as a ""working blanket"".The problem is that I can't sleep between the folds where the ""warmth"" is, only beneath it where the heat doesn't generate towards the bed. I turned on this blanket before going to bed. The sheets were still cold an hour later.I would four-fold the Biddeford Delighful Nights and let the cat sleep inside the folds, but I'm afraid she'll freeze to death."
5,The Real Deal!,"Ursula Rucker is what she proclaims ...SUPA. If you never heard her on the Roots albums as a guest poet then surely you are at a loss. This is her first album and it can be put in one category--Soulful! She tackles everything as far as subject from growing up in Philly to how people get caught-up in the digital world. The tracks are fantastic...Jazz, Funk, Hip Hop, Soul, and even drum and bass. Her delivery and style are one of a kind, the kind that once you hear it, your hooked! On top of that, she is very deep and her stuff usually has multiple meanings. Go Get The Album!"
4,Great Poetic Album,"Beautiful piece of work performed by an inspirational poet. The production is superb, painting a perfect picture of music diversity, offering everything from soul to acid jazz and blending perfectly with Ursula's spoken-word magic. While it's definitely not the run-of-the-mill-type of average commercial music, `Supa Sista' does have a certain flavor that everyone should get a taste of."
2,PRETTY GOOD,IF U LIKE THE POETRY THING THIS IS A GOOD CD TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE IT BUT COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT IT IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. NOT A WHOLE CD BANGER!!!
1,Ridiculous.,"Def poetry spam on plastic. You wade through each selection'spreachy diatribes wondering when/if the music is going to start-this is simply not my cup of tea. Talking loud, but sayingnothing. Bruthas if you come home to your lady and hear thiscd on in the background or Sade's Lover's Rock, just turn aroundand come back when the drama clouds blow over...."
5,Important and relevant to our understanding of ourselves.,"Paul Drew gives the world his diary. His Viet Nam experience is the cover story, but the change in the man is the book. Drew expresses in an intimate and engaging format the impact of war, politics and social upheaval on an everyman. ""After the Storm"" is a strong statement against streo-typing and against our desire to have history wrapped up in a neat little package. This is an important work in that it combines a valid perspective on the American century with an Odysseus-like inner journey. Highly recommended for the generation that came after the war."
5,Experience--Reflection--Wisdom--Healing.................,"I truly never did so much thinking after reading this book, and I'm still thinking.... As I read, I felt like my vision was getting clearer about how Vietnam made such an impact on not only the veterans' lives, but on their families and friends for the rest of all of their lives. There were many passages that I really would admit are steeped in true wisdom....a wisdom which can be gained only through experience and careful contemplation over many years.....one of my favorite passages was towards the end regarding how the author thought he could best explain what the healing process is like.....with mention of an oppressive dense rain forest bearing down on you, and then you ""swallow the sun""........ spectacular....these are the kind of descriptions that jump out at the reader and stick with you for a long time.... I feel that Paul Drew is a little less of a complete stranger now......his reflections make the reader feel like a friend."
3,It would work but it was uncomfortable,It was so uncomfortable I could not wear it all night - my toes fell asleep and I had to take it off by about 3:00am so... additionally I ended up not wearing it all night and even the few hours I did wear it my calf muscle started hurting more than my foot did so I ended up with two pains instead of one! I could hardly walk - the material should be softer!
2,Alone in the dark,"This book started very well in terms of the changes in human physiology after dark would have like to have read more of this. However, the book soon devolved into the book on the ""equipment"" not bad if you keep it reasonably brief but it occupies to much of the book. Secondly I was hoping for more updated information and use of other human senses, hearing, smell etc. its not there but the current tactics seem to be to paint daylight over the night, not always a good idea. Thirdly It seems that when honing the other human senses in the dark was once basic to training,technology not being as advanced as now, those who learn the art of moving unaided through the darkness will make it even if the batteries go flat. For equipment buffs a good read for those looking for the edge in the dark with no gear wait for the next edition."
3,limited information,Book is ok but really no new information presented. Save the money it really did not enhance anything you could find for free on the net... must be better sources
2,Rogers and Hamerstein disappointment,"This is a beautifully restored and digitally remastered copy. One of the poorest examples of the genius of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals. Poor screenplay, poor plot, very few hit songs. If on Broadway today, it would close in the first week if not after the first night. I resold this DVD."
3,Buyer beware,"Being both a Maineac and an ardent Rogers and Hammerstein fan, I had seen Carousel when it made the tour of Maine movie theaters years back and wanted to enjoy it again as our temporary residence in the Southwest brought on that longing for the Maine coast. However, for those interested in purchasing the video, I would strongly suggest avoiding the widescreen version which we purchased. We don't buy many videos and did not realize that on the video case it states: ""the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are standard for a widescreen presentation."" It was like watching a performance through the sight opening in an old Army tank. Very disappointing viewing even though, as always, we thoroughly enjoyed the R&H's muscial score and lyrics- buyer, do yourself a favor and increase your enjoyment. Purchase the regular VHS or DVD, not the widescreen."
2,"If I have to see this movie again, I will scream!","When I rented this film, I thought that it would be rather interesting. However, I found it to be very dull, depressing, and long. Also, the characters speak about clams for around ten minutes! How DULL! However, the ending makes you think how much you should'nt take life for granted and brought tears to my eyes. OK for watching once, but, a second time could kill you."
2,Not family entertainment,"We purchased Carousel as part of a boxed set. Having found R&H musicals to be excellent family fare, suitable for our 8 year old with plenty of re-watchability, we found this title to be disappointing.While I suppose the gloomy storyline and adult oriented themes may be pleasing to some, our entire family found this picture to be unpleasant. The few good production numbers (i.e. ""June is Busting Out All Over"") aren't enough to overcome the negative feel. We will probably not play this movie again, unlike others in the set such as Oklahoma, The King & I, and Sound of Music which we view over and over again."
2,South Pacific,Color is terrible. Some portions are shaded so poorly it is difficult to see scene details.
2,Not the newer State Fair,I would have purchased this item if it had contained the State Fair with Pat Boone and Bobby Darin as claimed. But as the picture on the cover clearly depicts the older version I was not interested.
1,An R and H failure.,"NOT R and H material! They should have spent the whole movie at the carnival, but NOOOOOOOO!!! They spent the majority at the sea. Too lovey dovey. I expected something more brighter. I vow, I will never watch this movie again unless I have too. Oklahoma! was better and happier. In my book, R and H failed this time. Sorry."
5,The Ultimate,"I remember seeing ""West Side Story"" on the stage in an early run. The finale ..so downbeat was stunning.It left the audience in awe. The assumption was that ALL great musicals had the great wrapup and exhuberent finale..however , as in West Side Story and this film..the finale of hope and accomplishment are meloncholy..and if so leave a tremendous impression on the viewer.You can vicariously live through Billy Bigelows ordeal of lost love and its effects..and to see ones child grow up in the spirit is something.to remember. A farely simple plot is turned into one terrific musical a must be seen on dvd!"
4,The Best R&H Score,"""Oklahoma!"" was the first and broke with tradition; ""South Pacific"" has the most significant message; ""Carousel"" has the best score. The songs run from happy to inspirational. Music and lyrics are perfect.The colors are rich, the scope wide, and the singing voices of even supporting players are magfnificent. The official review gavce picture a ""3 of 5"" while I think it is a ""4"". The only reason for the deduction is the letterbox format that creates black bars at top, bottom,and sides of my 16X9 high definition TV (no, DVD is not high definition, but it is digital). I like it much better when the, in this case the 2.55 aspect ratio, is enhanced for 16X9 so there are no side bars.When you watch this re-mastered filmn it is difficult to believe it was made more than 35 years ago. Of the 66 musicals in my collection it is among the top four [no I can't further differentiate] and definitely the best R&H."
5,carousel,received this dvd from Amazon and it came fast and packeged great love this musical great music and great stars
4,I love musicals!,"This boxset is great! I gave it to my mom for her birthday and she loved it! The only thing is that for some reason the Oklahoma DVD case doesn't match the others....it's gold. The DVDs themselves match all the others, it's just the case. Does anyone else have this issue? My mom decided she didn't care as long as the DVDs were right so I didn't exchange it or anything, but it's still strange."
3,Up and Down Ride,"Allegedly innovative for it's time, 'Carousel' has tragic elements and an overture to herald the musical*. For those who insist on old-fashioned entertainment it is sure to please. However, a tritely written script doesn't help the proceedings no matter how much it may dwell upon love. Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs and score greatly improve the journey after a consequentially slow start. The results are mixed, but the best songs, particularly ""June Is Bustin' out All Over"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" give some badly needed zest even though the screenplay repeats itself or ineffectively borrows from elements of 'Our Town' and 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A comparison to Oscar and Hammerstein's best musicals, including 'Oklahoma' and 'The Sound of Music' will reveal this musical to be an inconsistent carnival ride to be sure.(*Based on information from Wikepedia.)"
4,Awesome collection of movies,"I love old movies and this was such a great find having them all together like this on DVD was super. I love the movie The King and I, and also The Sound Of Music both great movies. A must watch."
3,Not colorful or complete South Pacific,I was very dissappointed that the other dvds in the collection were great except South Pacific. The movie did not play in its entirety and the colors were not vibrant. They were mostly blue in almost the entire portion of the movie that did play.
5,"The Rogers and hammerstein collection (Sound of Music, Oklahoma, The King and I, South Pacfic, State Fair, and Carousel",This collection was great. Got this for my husband's parents and they are throughly enjoying it.
5,Wonderful Collection,This is the most wonderful collection that I have seen in a long time. It has all my favorite mussicals in one set and they look and sound better than I could have imagined. I love it and would advise anyone to get it for your library. Every child should see these great films at least once.
5,Rogers & Hammerstein Collection,This is a great collection of classic musicals. Would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Broadway musicals or Hollywood productions.
3,simple but sweet,"In Oscar and Hammerstein's Carousel, Julie (Shirley Jones) and Billy (Gordon MacRae) get to know each other at the town's carousel. Julie's an ingenue local and Billy's a carnival barker rogue. Of course, after a great deal of romance, singing and dancing, tragedy strikes and their lives are altered irrevocably.I grew up on O & H musicals and know them well. Although simplisic, they capture the essence of innocent love which is irresistable to a romantic. This is Jones' first major role and she would be paired up again a year later with MacRae in Oklahoma. These films are classics because we can't help but sing the songs and suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours in a world where ""Grover's Corner"" still exists."
1,Region Problems,This was advertised as a Region 2 DVD but it is not marked as region 2 and it will not play on my Toshiba all-region DVD player. All my other region 2s play OK so there's something unusual about this one. Or maybe its my player; anyway I have to return it.
3,"Good, but...","The film had some wonderful performances, but they really softened it up from the stage version. They cleaned up some of the language, but the worst part is how they changed Billy's death from suicide to an accident. Totally changes the impact of his death. When he screams out ""Julie!!"" and then stabs himself on stage, it is truly hearbreaking. Regardless, the ending still gets to me."
5,Oldies but goodies!,"I bought this collection for my father as a fathers day gift. The smile it brought to his face was priceless. Another reason this was a great gift is because we will be able to spend time together watching them. This definitely made up for all those silly, useless, ""didn't know what to get him"" gifts."
5,Timeless Movie,"Carousel, is a great Broadway 50's classic, now in DVD.It's a timeless romantic show thats both happy & sad.The songs are great too.This is a show that all will enjoy.Carousel (50th Anniversary Edition)"
3,Ok!,"I expected the movie to be a lot better than it was, but I still think it was pretty good on the most part. ""Carousel Waltz"" is one of my favortie instrumental songs, and the music in this movie is pretty good.One thing I wasn't impressed with was the plot. I thought Julie and Billy fell in love a little too fast, and I agree with one, they should have had more carnival scenes than beach scenes. Still, I thought it was pretty touching and had a hopeful ending, so I gave it three stars."
2,"Carousel great, DVD skips","Of course Carousel is a classic, and the music endures, however, I was excited to view this DVD of Carousel with my daughter so she could audition for an upcoming summer stock production. I was disappointed that the DVD stalls and gets hung up regularly. It was so frustrating to watch that we gave up. This is the second time since Christmas that this has happened when purchasing a DVD thru Amazon.... After ordering the Star Wars 6-pack, Star Wars II was not watchable. Does Amazon have any quality control behind the scenes???? Repackaging and returning it doesn't seem worth the expense...."
2,Helpful reviews,"After reading several reviews, I have decided that I am NOT going to purchase this collection. However, I do plan to purchase the most recent Sound of Music 45th Anniversary on Blu-Ray. I will also plan to purchase the other Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals in this set only when they have also been fully enhanced and put into such remarkable collections as SOM."
2,"Great musical - horrible storyline for a ""family movie"".","Don't watch this one with your kids. It is hard to explain to young children why women were treated with such disrespect in the timeframe the movie represents. As a musical, its all Rogers and Hammerstein."
1,Strange and sappy,"This movie was a big disappointment. The love story between the two is not developed and you wonder why she would ever want to marry such a man in the first place. You never see any redeeming qualities, not even when he is in heaven. They have a musical number with a corpse right there next to them. Never during the movie does she ever feel anger towards her completely amoral husband. She loves him unconditionally and the movie even sugar coats the wife-beating. Her daughter asks her at the end of the movie, ""if anyone could ever hit you really hard and it feels like a kiss"" and Shirley Jones says emphatically, remembering her fond days of abuse, Yes! Very very strange movie."
5,Carousel Special Edition,"Like most of the reviewers I love the film of CAROUSEL, but still regret the cuts that were made in the final edited version of it, hopefully and according to the newsletter of THE RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN organisation some of this at least will be put right when 20th century Fox releases a special edition of the film on to DVD,to celebrate the 50th Anniversary in spring 2006, along with special editions of THE KING & I and SOUTH PACIFIC!!!"
4,Classic Collection,"This is a lovely set of classics to keep for those who either remember these movies, or who would like to be introduced to these all-time classics. Our only disappointment was that out of the 6 movies, only two were suitable for family entertainment (with our children) - The Sound of Music, and The King and I. It would have been nice to have one more to share with them, making it 3 family classics and 3 adult classics. Apart from that brief disappointment, my wife and I are happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the old time classics. For the music lover ... the music in these movies ... something to relish!"
3,"Great product, sad story","The DVD arrived in great condition, the music was beautiful, the color true, but the story was so sad I will probably not watch this very often."
5,Digitally Restored -- Wonderful picture quality,I haven't seen some of these since I was a young boy. We purchased these as a Christmas gift to us and we have not been disappointed! The picture quality is outstanding! And you get to see all the parts they cut out of the TV versions. Best $40 I every spent.
3,The movie is not as good as the music would suggest,"First off, the musical score is excellent (it IS a Rogers and Hammerstein Musical)The ballet done to the Carousel Waltz is great, however the movie starts with an over blown production number, punctuated, not once but twice with a fat lady pratfall joke (not funny) the dancers do the best they can, but the choreography is un-inspired, the movie suffers from poor direction, the robbery scene is laughable, however on the plus side, the vocals are outstanding MacRae is at the top of his game (vocally)Shirley Jones has never looked or sounded better, unfortunately MacRae's big number (my boy Bill) suffers slightly from poor recording, the transfer to DVD is really very good, not as good as South Pacific, but it doesn't miss it by far, I enjoy watching this movie, but not often, and not for any reason other than the music"
4,Only one thing missing,"I enjoyed this set of DVDs very much. I have long been a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan, and was very pleased to find a set that includes so many of the movies.But there is one thing missing: Rodgers and Hammerstein made seven movie musicals, but the boxed set only includes six. They should have eliminated the second disc for The Sound of Music and instead included the remaining musical, Flower Drum Song. Unfortunately, they have instead allowed this excellent movie to go out of print and are not producing it on either VHS or DVD."
4,A sad movie with beautiful music,"I had seen ""Carousel"" before on a used cassette my husband purchased at a yard sale. This was my second time (with a new cassette purchased through Amazon), and the singing is beautiful!! Shirley Jones had a lovely soprano voice and Gordon MacRae sang with tremendous power. Their love song, 'If I Loved You,' is brilliant, and Gordon's tremendous rendition of the `Soliloquy' by the sea is what I would call an Aria (used many times in operas). The ""Carousel"" story is a little weak, but the singing is exceptional and the dancing is good."
5,Rodgers & Hammerstein,This is another series that I purchased for my 82 year old mother. She is having a blast watching these old musicals. We're very happy with the entire transaction. Thanks so much.
4,well done,a must see classic. It is so nice to have it at my finger tips. picture quality is top notch.
5,very enjoyable movie,"this is a movie my sister stephanie asked me to get I don't know if my mom melane likes it ,but I was happy to get it for her.I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it.really great and fun movie"
2,"Important Topics, No Substance","I approached this book with the utmost hopefulness since there has not been one to date on Asian American youth. Unfortunately, now that I am no longer in my teens I have a difficult time relating to their borderline cliche reflections. For sure the anthology could have done without the ""Now I'm in this Ivy League college"" biographies and most of the poetry, about which I wonder if the authors won't be a bit embarrassed later on. This was a much-needed effort, but just because there is urgency does not warrant slack editing."
3,This book has good intentions,"I'm basically the market for which this book is intended, and while it is always important to understand and listen to teen voices, by which are no less important then any other this book dubbed poignant lacks its hefty title....and Yes I do realize that its for teens... but maybe the authors concept could have been developed more into a book about GOOD AND Talanted young authors instead of just a random junky group of contributers... also if you are looking for someting like this but with a bit more braun i suggest the book LEAVING DEEP WATER, thanks.."
2,Expected more,I went into this book with the expectation of learning more about the asian american story- instead I got very generic stories. I think it would be better if the writters weren't all just teenagers and early twenties.
4,How much stuff do you want to take with you?,"Inside of each compartment, there are additional pockets for your A/C adapter, a mouse, pens, a calculator, business cards, a cell phone, and just about every other imaginable item you might want to take with you. The main compartment has an internal sleeve to safely hold your laptop and still leave plenty of space for more stuff. (Heck, I can fit my flat-bed scanner in there!) The back pack will comfortably hold a 14""x11""x2"" computer. It's overall dimensions are 17""x13""x10"". (Ten inches! A little too fat for my taste.) Empty, the bag weighs about 3 & 3/4 pounds... Add a 5-7 lb. laptop, and fill all those little pockets and you'll be very happy you bought a back pack and not a brief case style case. If you like to take everything with you, and keep it all organized, you'll like this back pack. Despite it's excessive pockets and more than generous capacity, the price it right for this functional laptop case."
3,"too bulky, but sturdy","OK, I know that people are going to think I'm stupid for saying this, but this was just so bulky that I felt like a geek carrying it around and it wasn't exactly what I expected when I ordered it, I guess I thought it'd be more like those backpacks that just have a sleeve for a laptop but are otherwise, you know, backpacks. On the flip side it seemed very sturdy and like it would offer a lot of protection for a laptop, but if you're a student like me and planning to cram huge textbooks into the big compartment you won't get very far, and you'll probably feel geeky carrying it around too. My friends have backpacks that aren't as clunky and seem to offer the same amount of protection and sturdiness to their laptops as well as having plenty of space and pockets, I wish I could mention specific ones but I can't, so if that's what you want this isn't for you."
3,Sportster Replay 2 compatible with docking stations?,I just bought a Sportster Replay 2 and was considering purchasing a universal docking station. I was noticing on the specifications for the Solo Universal docking station that my model was not included. Is the Sportster 2 a different docking configuration then the Sportster 3 and 4? Please help me out. Thanks.
1,Horrible Radio,The FM modulator on this radio does not work at all. Save yourself the time and trouble and just buy something else. I can't stress enough how bad this radio is. I live out in the middle of no where and can't pick up more than 3 normal radio stations and the FM modulator still can't broadcast a clear signal.
3,Not for Audiophiles,"Overall sound quality is less than FM, a little better than AM. I was disappointed with the sound quality, but after I had chucked in the $$ for the radio and a year's worth of programming, I guess I will deal with it. I'll just quickly add my $0.02 on the FM transmitter being junk - use the aux if you have one or get a cassette tape modulator - either one sounds about the same (which is significantly better than the FM)."
2,buyer beware,"hi i purchased this unit for howard stern. its a great unit if you connect it direct to your radio,but i needed it for work so i used the fm transmiter feature. this has got to be the worst fm trans. i ever used. i live in new york, trying to get a strong signal is a chore and if you do there is extreme static avoid this unit."
2,Don't buy if you need the FM transmitter!!!!!,"I had an older model $20 starmate that someone smashed my window and took. I was very satisfied with my Sirius subscription so I decided to splurge a little and get a better model. Unfortunately, I have a factory stereo so I don't have an audio-in jack and I must rely solely on FM. This thing is nearly COMPLETELY WORTHLESS using FM transmission. How I pine for my lost starmate! I live in the middle of nowhere and have a wide open band but there is still annoying static even though I have started carrying the thing in my lap using myself as an antenna. It doesn't work on ANY channel - not one. To me it is a $200 doorstop.BTW: I notice my pre-FCC ban starmate radio is being sold for $50 and more on eBay now. One of them is probably mine."
1,P.O.J.,"I agree with the majority of the reviews. The FM transmission is totally unusable in my area, even with the FM extender cable. Unfortunately my Prius radio doesn't have a compatible hookup or I'd wire it directly. I've tried two of these radios, in case there was a manufacturing flaw, but no luck. I did receive a free month for my trouble; I just wish I could hear the free service.Another fun Sirius experience to share: I called technical support (Tues Oct 16) and their customer service person got agitated and hung up on me. Be sure to take note of who is helping you so you can assist their career growth by giving feedback to their manager.I am going back to my tried and true dinosaur JVC KT SR1000 for now."
4,For those of you Complaining about FM Antenna that comes with package,"For those of you complaining about the FM signal booster that comes with the Sirius Radio... Just thought I'd let you know that before the FCC started regulating the wattage for the booster, Audiovox made a 3 watt FM booster that works wonders in all markets. It's powerful enough to block out any FM interference when using your unit with the built in FM transmitter, and the signal carries over to create interference on your other stations. (Meaning if you were to go back to an FM station that you normally listen to, you will hear some static from this 3 watt signal booster)Just thought I'd let you all know that."
3,"Nice rig, but...","Easy to use, considerable improvement over older models, but the car mount kit only includes one option - the suction cup mount and it leaves a lot to be desired. On modern vehicles, it's almost impossible to use the suction cup unless you put it on the window and that interfers with driving vision - in paricular with a large pickup truck.They need to redesign the mount or add an additional option beyond the silly little vent clips which also don't work on modern interior air vents.A mechanical mount would be a great addition and make this a wonderful accessory for the car."
1,"Broke in 2 months, hideous customer service","My first unit was stolen at a car service place. I upgraded to this new one and transferred the account.The sportster had such low FM signal that it was worthless -- I had to use a tape converter.The unit broke in two months. You have to go to the Warranty People. Nobody knows anything, and they need proof of purchase to get the SID if you have changed your radio before they will talk to you. Nevermind that they have activated that SID already. So I faxed this to them and they never called back, as they promised to do.They charge you for the service while the unit is broken until you have proven your purchase, and say that you have to pay a termination fee to shut it off. Convenient.And unbelievable. Read through all of the massive criticism in these reviews of their customer service and keep in mind that you will likely fall into this trap, too."
2,Yikes !,"I go tthis for my dh for his birthday cause he had wanted one. Needless to say I wish I hadn't bought it. We ended up cancelling the service all together, we had bad reception in alot of places. I tend to believe it is not just the unit, cause we know alot of people who are not happy with Sirius."
1,did not load into video library!,"I could not even watch this after purchasing it. Buyer beware, I have no idea why this happened. Oh well:)"
4,The Way to Liberty-NIV,For my new-to-the-game hubby - excellent introduction to the Bible. He asked for it after seeing an ex-serviceman with same in church. Luckily Amazon had. Handy references at the front for what to read when (prayers & readings for different circumstances) and a 'how-to' get started guide. I gave it a 4 because its soft cover & ~I~ would have preferred hard - but that wouldnt be for everyone either. So 4.5 stars!
1,WARNING!! Do not purchase,Originally bought 2 of this product for my 2006 DTS. Worst decision i could have made. Buy GM mounts you will not regret the GM like you will the Monroe!
2,Not So Great....,"I love zombie movies and am always on the lookout for ones I haven't found yet. This is one that I wish I hadn't found. I think all the other reviewers must have watched a different movie than I did or maybe found some great peyote out in the desert while wandering west to east and east to west while pretending to time travel. The acting wasn't all that great, and neither was the script. The story and the beginning had promise, but it got lost and took a wrong turn on the way to the end. Speaking of the end, it wasn't a big surprise. It was broadcast all throughout the movie in not-so-subtle clues, regardless of what direction people were wandering out in the desert. I much preferred Exit Humanity, a well-made low budget zombie movie. The only thing that might cause me to lose sleep over this movie is feeling ripped off for wasting a couple dollars."
2,I wish I had amnesia!,This was a total pile of poo. I literally kept thinking it has to get better but no...the pain never ends.
1,Garbage,"This must of been a tax write off for some business person or something. I'm floored that is has actually won awards, I don't know what for though, don't waste your time or money on this. I warned you"
1,Find a trailer on YouTube,I suggest looking up a trailer on YouTube before renting this. It'll save you from wasting an hour and a half of your life.
1,Sucked,"This movie really sucked. I only completed watching it because I paid for it. It is completely confusing, even the ending does not really explain it. I can't believe the good feedback it has gotten. I wasted my money because of the feedback I ready :)"
3,A monster with some useless features,"The SKB large drum case is large and is tough as nails. The wheels are truly durable. The case overall is actually heavier than it needs to be, as the bottom half doubles over for about six inches from the upper edge, but that is the level of protection SKB has attempted to build into the case. The most useless feature of the case is the insert tray, which I find unnecessary and which is almost as heavy by itself as the main (bottom) portion of the case. I threw the insert away, but that leaves two small gaps under the edge of the lid which make me a tad bit nervous."
1,VERY THIN MATERIAL,"Just made to store, uh, i really don't know. Socks maybe? It is paper thin and bends way too easily."
2,Not advertised properly,"This case seems like a good deal, and it is, but only if you have a 14 inch or smaller notebook. I have a Toshiba with a 15 inch screen and it wouldn't fit in the case. My kids have 14 inch notebooks and they did fit, but it was tight. Good price, but check your notebook size first."
1,A Disappointing Experience,"I ordered this notebook case through AMAZON from one of their ""third-party"" vendors because that vendor offered a lower price than some of the others.Two days later, I get an e-mail from this ""vendor"" stating that ""he's sorry, but he forgot that he put the case on Amazon, and that he no longer has it for sale"". He DID say that he would see that my payment was refunded.I have ordered several items from Amazon, and I was not aware that this type of situation could occur."
5,"My 3-year old ""love bug"" loved this book!!","Although the age recommendation showed a minimum of 4-years, my 3-year old immediately fell in love with this book when she got it for Valentine's Day. Although very delicate--because of the pop-up pictures, the verse and intricate pop-ups kept her rapt attention. I'm buying another copy of this wonderful book to replace the one her little brother couldn't keep his hands off. An expensive Valentine, yes--but so worth a little girl's adoration!!"
4,Very cute!,"I got this book because my kids also have and like _Bugs in Space_ by David A Carter. We've read _Love Bugs_ 5 times in the hour we've been home from the bookstore! The pop-ups are very well done. My only ""complaint"" is that it's a little shorter than I expected; it's only 5 pages long. I do recommend it as a cute book for your little Valentine."
2,Could be summarized in 2 pages.,"If you're brand new to trading and options, then this book may be a below average introduction. I've traded for years, and am sending this book back. The author speaks of all of the advantantages of high risk option & stock trades, but doesn't adequately note the risk or the steps to get out of a bad position. If all trades were sure things, you wouldn't need a book. Read ""Trading For a Living"" by Elder if you want to learn something, or something by Pring or Murphy about technical analysis."
2,As basic as it gets...,"Could the people with an interest in the sale of this book please stop writing ridiculous one sentence reviews praising this very basic book! The reason most of the reviews of this book are one sentence is because it is the same person trying to restate biased praise. If you are absolutely brand new to trading, this book is fair...but beware. This book was suggested to me by a sales rep. at Wade Cook and you know what happened to him. That affiliation alone should scare you."
2,Good book for the beginning trader,"This book is a great book for someone who has NO knowledge of stock market trading. It gives some very good basic information about trading as a business and the rudiments of strategies for trading stocks and options. However, this book was written 10 years ago and is mostly outdated.I have just finished a 3 month on-line trading class led by Mr. Eldridge and he does not currently use ANY of the strategies mentioned in his book. Need I say more? Save your money unless you are looking for a very basic primer on trading."
5,Excellent Read,"I found this book after attending an online class at <a href=""http://www.bettertrades.com"">bettertrades.com</a> and have never been happier. It's simple and to the point, and makes clear all of the various strategies for trading in a volatile market. Go for the gusto and keep your losses small! (Because there will be some!)"
3,Don't expect too much from this book.,"Don't expect to learn much from this book. Strategies are all well known. Buy low and sell high. If you think that you are going to make a lot of money just by reading this book, think twice. Make no mistakes. The author suggests some risky (some very risky) strategies and the stock market is not all roses like the book wants you to believe."
3,"A basic fundamental explanation for ""Covered Calls""","For the money, a good detailed explanation for the strategy of ""Covered Calls."" For the average 'lay-person' a good introduction, for what I consider the only safe ""option"" strategy."
4,"good man, great education",a few of the examples do not seem to add up correctly and the book is not 320 pages. It is 178. I would still buy it but more of bob would be greatly appreciated.
5,Such pretty music!,This is very pretty classical guitar music. It is relaxing and is great background music for parties/or just being at home.
3,Not an E-3A model,"The model depicted is not an E-3A. It is a block 30/35 model, with the 960 AACS squadron color on the tail. The tail number is not valid, as the US E-3s start with 71 and end in 83 for the first 2 digits. I have never encountered 442, and my research shows it does not exist. Cannot determine externally whether it is a B or C model, except by tail number. The AK on the tail is the symbol for Elmendorf AFB, Alaska"
3,False Advertising / Misleading Thumbnail,"I ordered one of these as a test for my game capture device and so far it works. The problem is I thought I ordered a splitter that was all black like the picture suggests, but instead I was shipped a splitter that was black on one end (male) and white/red on the other (female). I was a bit angry about the mishap and quickly got over it since it still did the job done.In short, don't sell what you don't have Mr. WennoW. BUYER BEWARE"
2,not what you see !!,"I needed 2 of these y-audio cables in black so I could create 2 audio out-puts to 2 different sources. When I received them, instead of them being all black they were with red and white ends, not what is shown, not cool!! Send what you show, not what you want. Was told to send them back for full refund, did not want refund, I wanted what I ordered. They could of sent correct item to me with a return envelope, they know item was wrong. Another writer had same problem. Very Disappointed !! Would not buy from this vendor again !!"
3,Stars Seem to shine too much,"I was a bit disappointed in the context of this book. It seemed to me that Rosemary Altea was ""boasting"" of her relations with princess Diana more than she was addressing the realm of her profession. I found it uninspiring and, quite frankly, a publishing blunder. With the popularity of all things spiritual, one would think those responsible for overseeing this project would have enlightened Rosemary to the potential danger of jumping from one subject to another...the pattern of the book is almost nonexistent."
1,Wastefull,"Pure drivel. A poorly written rework of Lobsang Rampha's work of 30 years ago, expect he was a better author. Waste of time and money."
3,It took me to another plane.,"I obtained this book from a library after waiting two weeks, being placed on the waiting list. I found that there was too much personal interest in your life regarding to your alcoholic friend."
2,"same old stuff,,,new author","BEING A HIGH INTUITIVE SINCE BIRTH..MANY, MANY YEARS IN CONNECTING,,THE TRUTH BEING IS THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN NOT TEACH TO EVERYONE NOR DOES SHE KNOW THE ANSWERS...SAW HER ON LARRY KING...SAD..A REAL PSYCHIC KNOWS THAT THIS IS A GIFT NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH MONEY...THE INFORMATION IS FREE...IF SHE DOES NOT GIVE AWAY HER INFO...SHE HAS NOTHING TO SHARE...HER WORDS ARE THE SAME AS OTHERS...STEMING FROM FUTURE GREED..MANY GIFTED PEOPLE HAVE LOST THIS GIFT AS A RESULT OF GREED...HER BOOKS ARE RAMBLING...I FEEL SAD FOR HER..."
2,Too Graphic : (,"Although highly interested in RoseMary and her work, I was shocked at the graphic descriptions of her abuse. I was enjoying this book when out of the blue comes an extremely descriptive paragraph of (sexual abuse).**If you are sensative to blatant descriptions of child sexual abuse, this book is not for you.**I wish there had been some clue that she was about to write such a distasteful, disturbing paragraph, I would simply have turned the page. As it was I put the book down and haven't finished; doubtfully ever will."
3,A book full of comfort.,"This book is full of interesting anecdotal material from Rosemary's life and work, but what's really marvelous is the bit at the back in Grey Eagle's own words. His words have an incredible amount of wisdom. They're quotes worthy of being memorized and hung up on every wall."
4,Changing the History of Jam,"A classic album. I put this, Four, and Travelers and Thieves on all the time, and I love 3/4 of the songs on every release. Highlights here being Alone, Sweet Talking Hippie (a great transition between those two as well), the breakout college radio hit But Anyway, Gina, Mulling It Over, the super bluesy groove of Warmer Days... ok so maybe that's most of the songs on the CD and not really highlights but it's such a great album, put the whole thing in and just sit and enjoy! Amazing work! In fact, Blues Traveler music is probably more fairly judged as one whole work of art, instead of 11 different ones. So look for smooth, rolling 16th note bass vamps, some funky clean electric riffs, incredibly tight drum work that often turns out to be in some unconventional time signature, the soaring vocals with amazing range and timber, and of course the virtuosic harmonica work throughout."
5,"Woke me up, made me smile","Back when this CD came out, I'd broken my leg and was laid up in bed feeling depressed and sorry for myself. One of my housemates put this CD in, and the more I listened, the better I felt. By the time Alone and Crystal Flame were playing, I was literally clomping around the room on crutches, dancing with my cast on. It's a ton of fun, and contains some of their best songs...the aformentioned two, But Anyway, and 100 Years are terrific."
4,A great debut album,"This is a album is killer. It's a little rough around the edges, but there abilities as lyricists (But Anyway, Slow Change) and musicians (Dropping a Little NYC, Crystal Flame) shine threw. By thw way, But Anyway is NOT the only good song on here. Maybe the best one, but there are others worth your time and money."
1,How about next time there is a CD in the case,"I was really looking forward to listening to this CD because it brings so many great memories to me. But after i spent a long time prying it open, I was shocked and very disappointed to see that there wasn't even a CD in the box!!! How does this happen? I ordered it new. I am being credited and I will receive a new one next week. I hope the same thing doesn't happen."
4,Blues traveler CD,"What I expected. Solid raw beginnings of a young talented group.If anything, the 'moothie' dominated just a bit too much, but enjoyed the early sound."
3,Interesting!,"The mix felt like an entire night at a rave. First couple of tracks being your warmup DJs, next tracks would be your peaktime DJs and so on. There is a flow going on here, but for some reason I don't see playing this CD that often. Seems to fit a certain mood. Being different isn't bad, but as one reviewer here said ""it may never quite find its target audience"" seems to be about right. Track 8 was the only song to me that just didn't seem to fit in this mix.I guess if you're looking for something a bit different, this might be up your alley."
4,Perfect title for this book,"Ienjoyed the book. The editing could have, should have been done more carefully, but after I got past that the book moved along and kept my interest from start to finish. It was interesting to see the methods of 1954 police and judicial procedures compared to the present. I met the author at a signing and her presentation was great. When the questions were asked regarding characters, and many other points concerning the book, it was obvious the author researched the 50 year old crime thoroughly in order to maintain the credibility and accuracy of her work. For a first time author, I applaud her efforts. I would welcome another book by this author and encourage her to continue in the literary field."
3,Average,"Meeting the author and having discussed where the story came from, it makes for it to be a bit more interesting then if I didn't know it was based on real events. But real events doesn't cover for the bland sentence structure, of partisan language, and lack of anything symbolic. There are hardly any similies, hardly any metaphors, hardly anything that connects one sentence to the other. The sentences are there. There written like this. Each action is it's own sentence. It is borring sometimes. It is tedious sometimes. If you are annoyed by this. Then you may want to think before getting the book."
3,mystery/suspence/reality,"The book was well written. It could have been a detective novel, but instead was the real thing."
2,So so,"This movie is not exactly what I expected it would be. As in some other cases I was attracted to it by a very well manufactured preview which made me believe this was a movie I couldn't miss. At times you are sitting there wondering why you should be watching it and that to me is enough to make me feel rather annoyed. To put it quite bluntly, if you have 25 or more dollars to spend on something, buy something more useful and more importantly something that you might use or, as in this case, watch more than once. Good day"
1,Glad I only rented it,"I am definitely in the camp of those who do not like this film. One of the most boring and pointless I have ever seen. Absolutely no story. No characters, even though there were a lot of people. No images I cared to see."
4,Pre-web viral Legends Pete n' Ray and their origins... Sort of,"In the 80's Pete n' Ray were a huge underground hit! Unknown to the guys who recorded their loud neighbors. Ed & Mitch lost control of this audio as it was viral before the Web was invented... This documentary represents they attempt to gain control over the material while telling it's origins, including a retroactive meeting with Peter explaining the Cult of the Tapes and offering him a royalty check. 'Shut up Little Man"" is a great exploration of street legends in the same vein as Red's Tube Bar Tapes or Orson Welles' Green Pea rant. The play based on the tape in the 90's and Hollywood's angle on developing treatments. The audio is Still going to this day although now it's copyrighted... That hasn't stopped Peter Haskett vs Christian Bale type mixes."
2,Not really worth paying for.,"This is mainly a movie about two men (and a small group of people) who try to capitalize on three loud, drunk neighbors. It goes from a story of annoyance, to interest, to exploitation. It's boring, certainly not worth paying for, and arguably not worth spending time on."
5,Eye opening,"One day, while at my boyfriend's parent's house, I saw Princess on the coffee table. Simply interested, I read the first chapter. Unable to put it down, I simply had to borrow it until I was finished. That Christmas, my boyfriend's mother gave me the boxed set.What an incredible story! Every person, woman or no, should read this book as it gives you so many different emotions. Anger, fear, and thankfulness, this beautifully written set gives you the umph to finally get out and change your world. If one woman can change Saudi Arabia, why can't you change your own life?"
2,Cheap From China. Advice: Just spend $3-4 and buy the real deal!,"Cheaply made from China. It took like 2-3 weeks to get here. It look so cheaply made, I didn't even bother to try it out. My advice: Just spend $3-4 and buy the real deal!"
4,One for the Environment?,"When you need a bargain basement dual inline coupler that works, this is an excellent choice. If you feel the need for your new merchandise to show up in its own individual retail package (or even a basic baggie, for that matter) then you're going to be sorely disappointed. It appears that the seller may have purchased a bulk box of these and decided to sell them off as individual units. This coupler has been working adequately for my needs and has turned out to be just what I needed."
2,"If you didn't live it, it sounds pretty lame","Did you ever hear those Monkees songs from the late 80s? Over processed music, lame, highly mechanical beats and synthesized vocals combine to make something with all the personality of lukewarm gelatin. This guy can play, but this package leaves A LOT to be desired. Hard-core Genesis fans maybe, but I played it through a couple of times and it will be relegated to the far reaches of my collection."
4,Not perfect but not bad either,"I would guess that Tony Banks' first album A Curious Feeling was the culmination of a lot of ideas he had accumulated while working with Genesis. I have a hunch that The Fugitive is what was left over.Still, there are wonderful things like And The Wheels Keep Turning. I think it was a mistake for TB to do his own singing but given the wretched, over-the-top vocals on most progressive albums he doesn't come off too badly."
2,Weak 80's pop,"I wanted to like this album, becuase I think Tony Banks is a brilliant keyboardist, but I was disappointed. What we have here is an album with almost no direction, the music is flat(his Genesis work soars in comparison), and the lyrics read like a valentine from a shy 14 year-old. What we have here are basically what was left on the cutting floor when Abacab and Duke were conceived. Those are both spectacular Genesis albums, and I am glad this material was excluded from them."
3,interesting stuff.....,"If you really like Tony's work with Genesis in the early 80's, this will be a welcome addition to your collection. There are a couple of interesting instrumentals and a couple of pop format songs here, very much along the lines of Abacab or Genesis(self titled)."
3,"Hey, Jimmy Caan rules! Of course, he messes with Arnie...","Not Schwarzenegger's best, and not as amusing as True Lies, but it's a solid action movie. Of course some things don't make sense in the plot (like how Arnie gets away from the 250 security guards off-camera), but this is forgivable because it's Schwarzenegger, and you always know he's gonna fry the bad guy. Who in this case is Jimmy Caan, who is an excellent actor and makes a convincing crook. Vanessa Williams and especially Robert Pastorelli make this a bit less mindless than stuff like Commando. And in terms of action movies, you can't go wrong with a) having rail guns and b) giving a couple to Arnie. And of course, the whole mess of explosions and freewheeling 727s is much better on DVD."
4,"On its own level, a nice action film","Strong man Arnold Schwarzenegger is in is element as a licensed killing machine whose job it is to be big brother to people enrolled in the witness protection program. The film's first few scenes show our hero at work on some bad guys who have located a family thought to have been erased but hero Arnold is there to save them in the nick of time. Vanessa Williams stumbles into harm's way and becomes Schwarzenegger's ward. The two form an uneasy partnership and manage to stay one jump ahead of the heavies for the remainder of the film. There are plenty of over-the-top action sequences, wild chases and bad guys that make it fun to root against them and explosive CGI effects for the more implausible scenes. The movie is a fun action picture, and as such, is enjoyable and a good way to spend two hours in fantasyland."
4,Dj Defprince! review on Eraser,Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Governor ) proves in this high action drama that he is capable of protecting the state of terrorists. I on the other hand will protect your investment by advising you that this is a superb dvd for your action collection. Aronld's character John Kruger a U.S Marshal battles his tutor in a quest to prevent super weapons from getting in the wrong hands.This has got to be one of the best action movies I've seen.......I'ts a classic!
5,"eraser, One of Arnolds best.","I have been a fan of Arnold's movies from his Conan days. Yes, as cheesy as they are I still like them. Eraser starts off fast paces and picks up from there. While Arnold is the star of the movie, Vanessa Williams is a star in her own right and made her character believable. I especially like her scene in the zoo. Cornered by a rogue agent who tells her he is working with John (Arnold) she asks him for the secret handshake. While the man is trying to figure out what she's talking about she shoots him in the thigh with the gun concealed in her purse.This is one of the movies I can watch over and over.Richard DraudeAuthor:The Adam Eradication"
4,"""Trust me""","I had this on laser disc and the blu-ray is way better for picture and sound quality. Pretty good action flick by ""Ahnald"". Robert Pastorelli just about steals the show with his performance. The ""pay-back"" is justice well done."
3,fun movie,"This film is fun but a bit predictable, and Arnold will never win an acting award. Sone of the throwaway lines are still funny"
4,One of Arnold's Best,"A down-to-earth, almost realistic action/thriller/drama that has withstood the test of time. Vanessa Williams acts her (beautiful) butt off in this- running from laser guns, fighting atop a cargo container suspended in midair. Add in James Coburn and James Caan, and it is still a great rental all these years later."
4,very good action adventure film...........,Arnold does good job here being larger than life witness protection specialist. Robert Pastorelli gives a great performance and provides some humor that lightens things up a bit. James Caan in what turns out to be a bad guy role is also a plus. Good special effects shoot out at the end. Good for what it is and that's not bad. Recommend!
4,A catalog edition with some highs and some lows,"Eraser is a good action flick but, is this edition good enough to satisfy the fans?Well, technically this BD is quite strong. The master used is in very good shape and there's nothing important that can distract us. The video quality is satisfactory with an average detail level and a little softer picture.Audio track isn't as agressive as we can hear in newer productions but the action sounds vibrant enough to feel the movie.The low point is obvious: there's no extra content. Well, most of us like to dig a little inside the production, so this issue it's disappointing but, overall, the more important thing is the movie and Warner did their homework right with that.For a catalog title Eraser is a thumb up."
3,It doesn't kill your brain,"While the change from all-out ""let's kill everybody"" to an FBI-based spy action is intriguing, I found that decreasing the special effects in favor of accreting a cohesive storyline does not work marvels for Arnold. The ""undercover man"" image just doesn't do him justice. Come on, people, where last have you seen a seven-foot-tall spy? The story doesn't have quite enough incidental laughs in it, but, for some reason, I found myself chuckling at the zoo shoot-out scene. This really isn't the best of what such a star as Arnold can do."
2,Ah-nuld can do better,"A hollow piece of movie-machinery with waste-of-space Schwarzenegger as some kind of FBI agent who specialises in Witness Protection. Action and effects are piled high to little effect; the film has no center, no driving force and no charm. Director Charles Russell tries to keep it all together but he clearly doesn't have a clue."
1,Excrutiatingly awful !,"Not content with the pace that Hollywood has set in the 'dumbing-down' process in the production of its movies, the makers of this piece of asinine drivel set out to insult even the intellectually disabled. One could be more forgiving if it had been presented in animated form, for, as in the cartoon 'The Roadrunner'- it belongs to this genre - Arnie, like, the coyote, just keeps on coming back. It's not movie-escapism; it transcends trash."
1,Definitely not one of Arnold's best...,"Eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot. This movie possibly will be owned by many, but remembered by few. James Caan was the only talent that Eraser has to offer. Sorry guys, my wife bought it, I watched it, gave it away and divorced her."
1,"""Erase"" this bomb from your shopping list.","Arnold Schwartzenegger, the actor who just can't figure out that the age of super-action thrillesr characteristic of the era of his favorite President Ronald Reagan are no longer in vogue, disastrously attempts again to dazzle us with the mindless flop, ""Eraser."" In this film Arnie plays a member of the ultra-secret Witness Protection Program, and just can't figure out why his witnesses keep getting bumped off before they can testify. He later finds out that the evil James"" Have You Seen My Career?"" Caan is behind it all, and what's more, he's out to kill both him and ornamentation co-star Vanessa Williams. The movie soon becomes ""Death by Cliches"" and an embarrising high-tech action contest, ultimately culminating in the viewer falling asleep and waking up towards the end, seeing the movie still on, and saying, ""...is this film STILL going?"" END"
3,Solid Action Flick,This isn't Arnold's best by far but it isn't a bad movie either. I think its pretty solid entertainment as action movies go. James Caan and Vanessa Williams give good performances and there are some great action scenes. Some of the cgi effects though (i.e. crocodiles) don't hold up well at all.
2,Gets a two instead of a one because its Arnold,"Was hoping for an 80s style Arnold movie, but this film fell short. I guess my hopes were too high. There will never be anything close to as good as Commando or Predator."
3,Not bad,"This is an action film, with a smart tough guy and a woman he needs to protect. I saw it, and now I can't remember a thing about the plot, though some of the details I do, like when Arnie used a refrigerator door for protection but still got his hand skewered.This film is fine to pass the time, but there is no reason to buy it or savor it. Recommended tepidly. While it is too bad that I no longer enjoy this kind of mindless action film, I guess there are better things to do with my time. While watching, I continually felt myself thinking, OK, whatever, some guy thought this up, I paid for it, what am I getting? Not anything new, that's for sure. And I didn't forget myself and get enveloped in the story."
2,RAWHIDE!,"As dull and dry as tumbleweed bouncing through an Arizona desert on the hottest day of the year. Arnie coasts, Vanessa is ice, Caan is the same-old, same-old, Cromwell is slumming (from ""Babe"" to this! ), and the action sequences are straight out of every Schwarzennegar action flick from the past decade (look for the scene that is the exact duplicate of the one with Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies when she's holding onto Arnold in mid-air).In conclusion: rollin', rollin', rollin,' keep dese doggies rollin'..."
1,Just plain bad,"This film was just plain bad. It had . . .> Bad acting. > Bad plot. > Bad dialogue. > Bad stunts.. . . In short, it was just plain bad."
1,A Terrible Movie For a Terrible Actor,"I don't know what these other people were watching. Maybe they are all lobbyists for organizations within California that are trying to pimp Arnold. Whatever the deal, the fact remains that this is hardly a watchable flick. The explosions are crummy, the plot is nothing short of a hurried scrawl written on three pieces of toilet paper and the acting is typical of every other Schwarzenegger movie during this time frame. Don't watch it, don't even recommend it. In fact if you own it, do us all a favor and burn it."
3,Great Video - Fair movie,Others can argue over the quality of the movie. I just wanted to replace the non-anamorphic DVD with a better fit for my projector/PS3 setup. The blue-ray copy doesn't disappoint. The details are great (maybe a bit too good when it comes to the FX shots). Dark levels are good and the details definitely carry through. The movie auto starts to the menu on my PS-3. No previews or advertising is a bonus in my book. Just a press of Enter on the remote starts the movie with no fuss.
3,It was a good comic book movie.,Good escapist stuff. Kept my interest. Get a bowl of popcorn when you watch it.
3,"Good movie, poor disc","To my taste this is one of the best action movies Arnold Schwarzenegger made, good acting from the main cast, also good performance from James Caan.The picture quality is very good on this Blu-Ray disc, and the Dolby ThruHD 5.1 sound is very nice!But this disc contains only a movie, no extra's, not even a trailer (Boo, bad Warner Bros)... The option menu is also very simple, a Play Movie and a setup option for your sound and subtitles.This is why this Blu-Ray only get 3 stars from me."
1,Assembly failed,"I have had a lot of furniture ordered online and assembled at home, so assembling furniture is not a problem for me. But this one was a defective piece, after spending hours and hours, the cabinet still wouldn't assemble - the drawer would not fit. Without the drawer the cabinet was useless. The proportions of the drawer were not correct. Returned the product, but the shipping costs both times during order and return were wasted."
4,(Among the) Best of the Obscure Among 2001's Albums,"After 17 years, when are the highly literate and melody-savvy Mr. Kelly and the retro psychedelic pop band he leads, Green Pajamas, going to get, at the very least, a decent cult following?"
2,Not my favorite,"For starting seeds It was inconsistent in maintaining proper moisture levels, thus prone to various pathogens IMO. I wouldn't tell others to purchase this product with the intention of germinating seeds. I will be trying this product with cuttings in the future, possibly with a favorable outcome and in turn a higher rating of this product"
4,Great way to start seeds! Cheaper than buying your plants at Lowe's,"These things are great. Really work at sprouting plants effectively and quickly. You can that transfer your plant to any growing system you want. I use to use them for an indoor hydroponic basil garden, I've cut them down to fit in an aerogrow as well, and as of late I'm just simply transplanting them into the ground outside. The plants always take quickly to the new environment. I'm hooked."
2,Dated,"I have been and Imus listener for 20 years. I rely on hearing the guy's voice in the morning. However, this album is as dated and dusty as the clothing and music that came out in 1974. It is embarassingly not funny and would be best suited for framing as a novelty item."
2,Poor Excuse for speaker Wire,"I have a Bose system and needed the RCA audio plugs and the split wire to hook up my speakers. When I opened up the box, I was surprised to find the wire was so thin. I've never seen wire this small before for speakers. I'm not happy at all with this product and wish they had actually put the wire guage in the details. Now I know why it was so cheap."
4,"Very thin wire gauge, is what it says it is.","I bought this cable to cut in half, to use each end for mating older RCA-input speakers to a bookshelf stereo with spring terminals.Though I did not expect more from this cable, I did observe that the thin cable gauge (22?) made it challenging to use with the spring type speaker terminals on my stereo, as they would not clamp securely to the tiny filament of wire,So.. if you intend to use this as I did (RCA-to-bare-ends) - probably best to just buy something else."
4,Japanese culture lesson intertwined with an intriguing plot.,A great read. One learns a great deal about Japanese Culture in this novel. Jay McInerney once again succeeds in putting the reader in needles with his witty social commentary. The circumstances of the plot keeps the pages turning and the reader guessing. The ending shocks the reader and McInerney's clever prose make the book a must-read for McInerney disciples and those who would like some insight into Japanese Culture.
3,"Not a bad novel, really","I read this as a lad in college, and I've always thought I was the only one who ever read it. It was fairly entertaining, and I liked the way Mcinerney writes, once he gets away from that second person singular ""you you you"" stuff in Bright Lights.Hey people, the lead character's name is Christopher Ransom. That's some double-barrelled symbolism there ... C'mon, the ending won't be a trick or a shock."
2,Not good,"Mcinerney isn't that great a writer. If BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY had not had the gimmick of being written in the 2nd person, it never would have seen the light of day. Nor would he. RANSOM only confirms my initial feeling about him. He's good enough to be a good high school English teacher. But to actually be a decent novelist...that's something else."
4,"Hard-faced, hard-edged, hard luck","Strange, but as a story goes McInerney's insight into one young white American's alienation in Japan should have been a blinder, a corker...but it missed somehwat and became nothing more than jumped-up sci-fi in the East. None-the-less, I am slightly baffled that no other reviewer has seen fit to note one of the most breathtaking and surprising finales in modern writing. So much so, it saves the book from the chop."
3,Just hold on for the ending...,"The setting of this book in Japan makes it quite different from any other book by Jay McInerney that I have ever read. The introspection of the character is also quite interesting. In all, I think that the interesting setting as well as the main character's quest to make peace with the actions he has taken in the past as well as his family demons makes it a great read."
1,Could not return.,"I ordered the wrong item. It looked exactly the same as the one I should have ordered (RBC24).I was able to slide the cartridge into my battery tray and all of the screws fit perfectly. But fail came when I tried to plug the power connector. It also looked almost exactly the same, except for a small notch on the connector making it incompatible. The specs for the batteries were slightly different. This one has 7AH per battery, when the RBC24 I should have ordered is 7.5AH.I could not use this battery unit with my UPS.I tried to return it but Amazon doesn't allow you to return batteries.My mistake on the part number, but they should allow you to return batteries."
5,Grandson loves them,I'm glad I got these while they were still available. They were a gift for the two-year-old to cook with mom and mom says they had good fun and the product worked as designed.
2,Where is my item???,"Usually ships within 24 hours. After 7 days, order still haven't processed.Amazon.com! please be truth to your words!!"
1,Defective design,"Owned this item for about 2 years.First, the little plastic handle on the cap falls off, because its fragile plastic, into which it is screwed, soon crumbles under the steam temperature. Then, the water level indicator develops a crack inside, where it touches the kettle's metallic surface, through which water leaks profusely. In less then two years, by which time the 1-year warranty is expired, the kettle becomes unusable. There are no replaceable parts, and no further help is forthcoming from customer ""support,"" except for a quote for another copy of the same."
3,Cute but Heavy,"It's very cute, and has large capacity, but I found it just too heavy and awkward. Because the handle is on the side instead of on the top (like the great, but late & lamented Russell Hobbs kettles) it doesn't balance well, and you are having to lift the whole weight of kettle and water. It's also very noisy. And somewhat hard to fill. I liked the water level indicator on the outside. If you're strong, or would like a little home weight-lifting exercise built into your day, this kettle would be fine.I returned this and got the Chef's Choice kettle, which is smaller, but handles much better. And it's very fast, (and loud) which somewhat makes up for the small capacity. It is easy to fill, very well-made, and has a very well-designed pouring spout."
2,Looks nice but leaks,"The Metropolis line of products has nice styling (we bought the toaster, blender, and kettle). The kettle, however, leaks from somewhere around the bottom. We will now need to figure out how to get it replaced"
2,A Mixed Bag,"On the positive side: it's cool looking, there's a loud clunk when it turns off so you can hear it from another room (and the boiling is loud, too), and there's a bright red on-light.However, it's not that easy to fill because it's narrow at the top, the handle fell apart in less than two years, the filter inside deteriorated and the finish on the cap has worn off because of the steam (I assume).No replacement parts available from the manufacturer. I guess theye xpect you to throw it away and buy a new one."
4,Good Tea Kettle,"Heats up quickly. Nice design, though a bit on the ""klunky"" side. I liked the style of my glass Capresso better, but the durability and capacity of this kettle is great. Plus the varied auto shutoff methods prevents me from killing this kettle like my last one."
5,"Metropolis kettle: works great, looks great!","We've had this kettle about a month or more and are very, very pleased with it's performance. We are a family of tea and coffee drinkers who are saving on our energy bill by using this electric kettle verses the old stove-top model. The Delonghi is trouble free, looks great on the kitchen counter and heats enough water for our teapots or large french press. We use filtered water, so there is no issue with cleaning or maintenance. The safety features are very handy (I've melted a few old style kettles to the stovetop!?!) and it heats the water quickly. I highly recommend this particular item, and I will order DeLonghi products in the future."
