3,Great Artist,"Lumidee is a pretty good artist i've heard before .When I frist heard her song and video (ooh never leave you)I thought it was great . After I heard the entried CD I really did enjoyed it. Although this is her frist CD ever my thinking was, she must be the most cooest artist i've ever heard of before. She must have worked with the best song writers ever . I know she isn't the best singer. I do think that with time and traing she will progress in her craft."
1,"When Lexar fails, Lexar can't be found","Jump drives are jump drives. Anyone giving good reviews on jumpdrives are probably working for the company. It would be like promoting a floppy disk. Come on.With that said. Lexar's jumpdrive failed on me. Contacting support was horrible.Phone support - No one answers. Tried in the day, night, and on the weekend. Never available.Email support - Email listed on website is invalid... Support@Lexar.com... tried emailing 4 times now. Each one bounces back to me.Online chat tool - Left it open for over 24 hours. No response...1) Product failure within 5 months.2) Email addresses not working.3) No one answers phones.4) No one answers chats.5) Foreign made.6) Foreign supported. (imagine that)7) All this, and sold for as much as the competitors... Can you say way over priced. Find another company to buy from."
4,FLASH USB Rocks,"Find it strange that I do not have this item? Read on:I own a 1GB flash USB gizmo... brand is not important... read on.The jist is: I can't work without it any more:I have my own program that copies my files (you can make your own batch file), i run it before I shut down my PC (or NoteBook).So my files are always with me...Awesome.If you do not have a flash card, you should stay in the 19th century.Just find a good one..."
4,Spin Selling is his best; this is very good,A good effort. Major accounts are the key to all solid selling; Rackman is always good to read. What company wouldn't want their people to read a selling book? See also Strategic Selling by Miller and Sales Skills by Simply Media. Amazon has both.
5,Excellent Book - Useful for those involved with major sales.,An excellent book. It is a very useful guide for all people involved with major sales (managing or selling). Unlike many books regarding sales it can help improvement in the following areas : 1. Organise concepts regarding sales 2. Avoid Critical mistakes 3. Adapt pattern of bahavior to a most positive one (with regards to major sales) 4. Better understand buyers 5. Understand the difference between major - small value sales. I strongly recommend it.
5,Great product,"This product is not available in my area, so I had to order on Amazon. It was exactly what I ordered. Would definitely recommend."
3,Reasonable manicure kit,"This kit could have had a bit more items, but the cutting tools are very sharp and effective."
5,Delightful book,"Let's put it this way, my 4 year old can now accurately pronounce the names of the dinosaurs and knows a fair amount about them. This book is wonderful. If your child is into dinosaurs this is the one book that you should get. It even gives a list of other dinosaur books that you can turn to for further reference. I'd have given it 6 stars or more."
5,"""Mr. Dinosaur"" loves this book!","My son who will soon be five years old, loves this book. We read it three times in a row when I first purchased it and we have read it many times since. It's clever and fun and informational, too. A great addition for the dinosaur book collector."
2,UnSeuss-Like,"Where the original Seuss was magically rhythmic, these is sloppy and forced. I appreciate them trying to meld most young boy's (and probably a fair percentage of girls) favorite things, but it comes across as a good idea really poorly executed. I don't think that we were expecting the clever playfulness with words that Dr. Seuss is known for, but a bit more of an attempt would have been nice."
1,who is dick????,The rhymes are forced but I got the book because my daughter is interested in dinosaurs and I thought it would be a good teaching tool. My main complaint is WHO IS DICK??? The kids name is Nick! Huge typo!!! I don't know how no one else has noticed this but I don't want to read the word dick to my daughter so it's gettimg returned.
2,NOT Dr. Seuss,"Read this book if you want to truly appreciate the brilliance of Theodore Geisel, because that is what is missing (somewhat grotesquely) here.The rhymes are forced and unimaginative. The meters are crude and regularly just don't work. The ""whimsy"" is unappealing, to say the least. The drawings are serviceable, but reduce Seuss's images to blank types without much imagination. (And just who is using military imagery -- a pop-gun tank -- in a post-Butter-Battle world?)I give it two stars just because my kids enjoy reading about dinosaurs, though I steer them back to the real Seuss (which they do genuinely enjoy more -- albeit maybe because I enjoy them more) whenever possible."
5,Absolutely adorable!,"This item is just as cute as it appears to be in the photo. It was purchased for my nephew's birthda,y and he loved it. I also like the fact that it is a 2 in 1 with it being both a book and a toy tractor."
2,Yea...,"Yeah...this product did not work with my computer. I installed the program from the TI website, tried plugging in the calculator to the computer, and it said it was incompatible with my OS. (XP) :( It's a pity because I really would have liked to be able to update my calculator via computer."
4,This legacy accessory works with TI-85 to serial port on XP/Vista,"Because it is so old the CD isn't easily run on XP but for some reason Vista displayed it perfectly. It can be read as files if you can find the US subfiles. The load program will have difficulty from the disk, but if you follow the links to TI and download the new loader it works fine on WinXP."
4,Great Features - Slow Speed,"The graph-link worked great for my TI-83+. One of my favorite features is that it supports all the calculators with the same program so it's easy to switch between different calculators. One thing that bugged me was the fairly slow transfer speed. It seemed to be about 250-500 bytes/sec. Inter-Calc transfer is faster. Other than that, it's excellent. One last awesome feature is that after transfering data, put your tongue on the wire and it feels like a 9 volt battery... VERY COOL!!"
2,Disappointed,"Although the graph link cable is excellent in principle, mine did not deliver as advertised. My computer/calculator interface was sporadic--sometimes it worked properly, sometimes it did not. Further, the CD-ROM that came with the cable was, in my opinion, of poor quality and was not user friendly; the help section was particularly disappointing. Finally, I found the TI internet resources for the cable to be substandard as well, with customer support being particularly inadequate. After visiting their site, I felt as though they needed some competition to help motivate product quality.... In conclusion, the TI grphics calculators are fantastic, but their accouterments need some improvement."
5,A must have,"This is a must have. You are able to put very useful programs for ur school courses on it. also, there are very numerous websites that u just download it onto ur calculator."
2,XP Users Beware,I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website... so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system.
5,Excellent Addition to a TI Calc,"I bought this accessory shortly after my purchase of a TI83+. There are *so* many programs available on the internet that will help you with day-to-day things, a must have for students. You can transfer programs from your computer to your calculator, every create your own programs using your home computer with the included software! It works well, have not had any problems with it, the same with all of the TI products I own. If you want to transfer games, or programs, or even update your TI Calc, be sure to grab this accessory."
5,Excellent,"The cable, installation, and software are very easy to use. Don't waste your money on self-made cables, this one is superior"
1,Should have been an essay.,"Basic ideas are sound, but I think nothing ground-breaking. I felt that each chapter could have been shortened into a paragraph or two. At most, this should have been an essay. Based on the way the book was written, I got the feeling that the authors were trying to influence the reader much the same way as a cult would try to brainwash a prospective member. While I agree that teachers should teach children to learn, I feel that the student will be in trouble upon graduation as the system of support will be gone. They will have to perform or fail... period. I felt the book to be too wordy, too preachy, too liberal... did I say too wordy?"
5,Good thoughts in layman's language,"The author documents an intervention for severe student apathy towards studies. The book is a quick read, appropriate for general readers as well as school staffs."
3,Dragged Towards the End,I haven't finished this book yet. I found the beginning useful and read it on recommendation of a former principal. There is a lot of talk about secondary schools.
1,DISAPPOINTING AND INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS,"This book comes with a CD-ROM. One would expect that the entire contents of the book would be on that CD-ROM, in Acrobat Reader searchable files - it would fit quite easily.Instead we get a few files for each chapter and they are totally unorganized. Each chapter file is in a separate folder and there is no table of contents folder to view them with.I searched high and low for some directions on how to use the CD and found absolutely nothing. Some of the files are HTML, so I clicked on one. Internet Explorer came up and I was able to read it. Then I click on one called DEFAULT.HTM and low and behold, it was a table of contents for one of the chapters.If this is any example of how they used FrontPage 2002 to make these files, this book leaves a lot to be desired."
2,NightLightFails,"This is my 2nd of this model and both night lights failed.Changed the battery to no avail.Other than that, it is OK, very light weight, & keeps good time.I prefer watches with stem guards, not only to protect the stem but also to prevent it from rubbing and wearing on one's pants pocket."
1,nurse practitioner drug handbook,"So far, I have looked up about 6 drugs and a handful of diseases - none of them appeared in the book. I am very disappointed, and have put the book aside for reference at home. Again, when I pick it up at home it often doesn't have the drug I'm looking for. I would not bring it to work because I cannot afford to not be able to find the information I need at work. At work I use Tarascon, where drugs are divided neatly into classes, and Nursing 2000 drug handbook for Pt. teaching needs."
5,True Gangsta Shieet!,"True Gangsta Shieet!Thats whats this is... Lil'E is as allways true gangsta when reppin the streetz of Compton! - With Eazy's twisted humor and phat lyrics these tracks gonna blow ya mind!When asked I can't even find a favorite track on this album, cus they all da bomb!!U gotta have this 4 ryhdin true!R.I.P Eazy-E"
2,Stop beating a Dead Horse,"When eazy was alive, he put out some of the tightest tracks to come out of Compton and was responsible for some of the dopest groups in hip hop. Yella on the other hand, who finished this cd after Eric's untimely demise, should have left it alone. This is a bad album. The production that shoud have been there is missing. It is just too bad that Dre and Eazy couldn't have squashed their beef and put out one last doope album with cube and ren. Rest in peace Eazy."
5,Eazy E's Best Album,"Eazy's 1996 album, (Str8 off the Streets of Muthaphuckkin' Compton) isn't just Eazy's best album, I think that it it one of the best gangsta rap albums in the world. ""Just Tah Let U Know"" has to be my favorite track on this album. It has great beats. ""My Babyz Mama"" is another great song on this album. The whole album is great, it's something that you can both chill, and party to."
2,Too short,"This book contains only a few pages of text and is heavily cut down from the original. Also the ""squirt"" tube on the back page is too big in diameter to squirt water out for more than a split second."
2,"Cute, but not worth the money","The seller shipped the item immediately, and it was in the condition as described. It is a cute little book, but I only gave it two stars because there is really nothing special about it, and it is definitely not worth the $80 that we paid for it. However, it was given as a gift to a friend who collects Dr. Seuss books, and she said she is glad that she received it as a gift because she never would have paid that much for it either."
3,"Unique book, but too little text.","This out-of-print book is perfect for bath-time; made out of waterproof plastic, the pages are thick and almost indestructible. However, the book is quite short with only a couple of words per page. And the text does not rhyme; which is unfortunate for a book for babies. The final page has a built-in squirt that can suck in water and squirt it out. This is nice for surprising your baby. All-in-all, an OK book for bath-time, though there are a lot of better ones."
5,nu vunyl,"Best stuff on the market. Been around for years, since the seventies I know because I have used it since then. Protects vinyl, car dash, even leather, better than anything else. Put it on rubber and on dash and not have to use it again for 6 months; even in the heat of summer. Best thing going. Does not give off a shinny glow but protects and has no drying effect of alcohol like some more known popular brands. Can't find a better product, I swear by it."
2,Nu Vinyl Protectant,"this item give false ads ant to me it has never did what they say it would do. I have used it on the seat and dash of my truck, I would have done better using water."
2,Don't Talk Back!,"I am republican, love what they do, and thought this would be a great book-NOPE. I like hearing Happy things the GOP does but this wrights off on so many issues that i cant tell what is the right thing to do. Dont buy get it at the lib. and when your a 1/5 the way thourgh you will be fed up even with your own partyHypno signing offthis book gets a 2.4 out of 5"
4,Good First Time,"I first saw this Di Sica movie 3 decades ago and thought it was a classic on par with ""Bicycle Thief."" Seeing it again after so many years, I was quite disappointed. Though mildly poignant, it was rough and seemed almost amateurish (which almost all of the many child actors were)."
2,"good idea, but loose magnets","I loved this item, and told lots of people about it. Right up until one of the magnets disappeared without warning. This happens often enough they sell the magnets separately on their webpage. I suggest they use a better glue. I paid $20 for the pair of sticks at a sportsman's show, they want $9 for one magnet? I don't think so, should be warranted. There are cheaper alternatives available, if I can't repair mine."
5,Excellent product!!,"Excellent product!!The hassle and frustration of hitching up my goose-neck horse trailer are in the past. What a cool product. Even my husband uses it now. Works great on bumper hitch trailers, too. Can't be without it. Really great!"
5,Works Great Everytime!,"I am a new trailer owner and do art shows all over the east and Midwest. I travel alone and am forced to drop my trailer at every show. This set enables me to hook up the trailer by myself with little fear of over steering into my bumper and without someone giving me directions that can and usually are misunderstood. So far the furthest I have been off of a dead center hook up is 2 inches to the right. This was easily fixed by nudging the trailer into place. You have to keep both eyes open like a gun sight for it to be dead on accurate, thus the 2"" miss. Keep them in line with each other from any angle and you are heading for the hitch. I also use one for a marker when the trailer is in the driveway so there are no accidents from others backing or running into the tongue because it is below their field of vision. Great product!!!!"
5,My Favorite Kitchen Tool!,"I ADORE this garlic press more than I can express. It has a wonderful weight to it and just feels good to hold. It's shiny and suits my kitchen perfectly. Garlic is one of my favorite ingredients, so this thing gets daily use in my kitchen.Before pressing the garlic, I smash the cloves with a knife and remove the skin. I then pack then into the compartment and press the garlic out onto whatever I'm cooking. Next, I open the press and remove all the garlicky goodness from within and add that to the dish. All in about 30 seconds!Cleanup us so simple. Just run it under hot water to remove any garlic and scrub it with a soapy brush for 10 seconds. I do not use a dishwasher and I've never noticed any water in the handles, as other reviewers have.I cannot recommend this garlic press enough!"
3,Ecellent quality - as usual with OXO,"Used the OXO garlic press a few times so far. Ecellent quality. Heavy. Rubber on handles keep you from slipping. I had to replace my old one - Progressive International Garlic Press - because it broke aftter only a year.I love OXO products, but sometimes I think they are over priced. This will pay for itself over time I hope. Cheers.Update: One thing I dislike is that every garlic skin gets jammed in and covers all the holes. If you don't remove it before the next one it basically just squishes the clove and the juice and pulp shoot back up at you - not through the holes becasue they are blocked. So I tend to not use it much because when I use garlic, I USE garlic. So I'm taking 2 stars away. My old one wasn't as well made but it did what it was supposed to do. Hope this helps."
5,"Heavy duty, love it",Very heavy duty with grip handles. I like how it closes backwards so the small rubber points can help clean the holes so all the garlic can be put in the recipe & won't be washed down the drain. Great product.
1,"Nice, but water gets inside handle in dishwasher","This is a nice, heavy-duty press. I found it easy to use and it works well. So far, the only problem is that water gets inside through the narrow seams in the handles during the dishwasher run, so I need to set it out to drain overnight after the dishwasher run is finished.This is annoying enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Note: the problem is getting worse, and the water remaining inside is soapy! I will try for warranty repair through OXO, as my return window with Amazon has ended."
1,What happened???,"Was so excited to receive and use my new garlic press. On the first use, everything went perfectly--easy to clean, perfectly minced garlic, etc...On the second use, one handle snapped off completely. Will return and likely buy another brand."
1,Gummy handles in dishwasher,"We have had this garlic press for a number of years, but now its handles have turned so gummy from repeated dishwashing that they turn the kitchen counter black just by laying it down. Plan on buying a new one every couple of years."
5,Excellent product!,I have had a garlic press for years but never used it much -- it was too hard to clean. My cousin gave me one of these about a month ago and I love it and use it all the time now. I liked it so much that I bought one for each of my daughters.
5,BUY IT NOW,"Ohh Why ohh Why did I not buy this years ago. Worth every last penny. I helps to cut my cooking time, in addition to allowing to have my fingers not smell like garlic from chopping and dicing. Buying this for everyone this years. This is a HomeRun!!!!UpdateThis is in constant use in my house. As my life has become busier 2 small children now. I have become more and more inlove with this press I have no time to manually chop garlic. If it wasn't for this I would be using tht store bought garlic in a jar which I hate, just does not have the same flavor to me. This press is also easy to clean.This product while is still excellent for my needs, may not be good for a real chef. I have noticed that as you press the garlic some of the garlic juices comes out. While that does not bother me it may bother some, so that is something to think about."
4,built to last,"This makes the ole garlic squish a breeze. The heft and design make it quite easy to get a lot of garlic squished very rapidly. A must for cooking that asks for quantities of garlic (Asian, Mediterranean, etc). I am only able to use one hand due to a nerve injury, even with that limitation I can use this press without a problem.A few imperfections do not make it a bad product but just as a heads up:There is a spot deep in the well that some garlic bits will get stuck in. Usually it is the most fibrous bits you do not want anyway. That said, when crushing lots - after 3 to 5 presses you'll have to clean that well out before progressing. Toothpick or knife tip works fine to remove the mush once you reverse the press like designed to get the remains loose.The basket is a bit tight, but not small. So elephant or very large cloves will still have to be hand or cleaver squished, the normal stuff fits fine.So no biggie in the way of cons, the pros quite outweigh them."
3,"Great for garlic, but it has a flaw that disappoints...","As a garlic press, this thing excels. It is shiny, and nice in the hands, but it also has a problem...The handles don't stay attached all that well, they sort of slide off sometimes. I'll post a picture.In use, this is not much of a problem, as I can just push them back on, but in the dishwasher, the poor fit means that the handles tend to fill up with water, which then drains out once the press is in the utensil drawer (which is not ideal). So, I always have to slide the handles off a bit to let the water out, which I'm sure will eventually make the problem even worse. It's not a fatal flaw, but it is really quite annoying.So, it's almost great, but not quite. My old garlic press was a chore to clean so we didn't use it much, but since we got this, we are easily using 2-3 times as much garlic each week, which I count as a good thing."
4,"Great garlic press, fairly easy to clean.","This press does its job well, and is very solid feeling, seems like it will last a long time. The press is fairly easy to clean - as the plastic teeth allow you to 'push' the pulp out of the press easily - the only thing i don't like that that if you don't put it upside down to dry, the handle retains water, that you have to shake out and let dry in several positions. This isn't a big deal, just kind of frustrating when you grab it and get your hands wet."
3,Zinc or stainless steel?,Description does not tell me if any garlic will come into contact with the Zinc metal. I want only stainless steel touching the garlic. Does anyone know?
2,Leaks...,"I'm typically a big fan of Oxo products, but with this garlic press they have missed the boat. I used a zyliss susi press for years until it just plain wore out. I bought the oxo because I liked the substantial weight. Unfortunately, the design does not match. It is no where near as good as the zyliss for pressing unpeeled garlic...no real problem I thought, it's not too onerous to peel the garlic before pressing. It's also not very good at pressing peeled garlic either. The plunger does not fit tightly so garlic squeezes out the sides as well as through the screen. It is not very efficient to clean, water collects in the hollow handles. The plating began to wear off within a few weeks. Overall, I'm disappointed...a first for me with an oxo product."
1,"Cheap, chrome finish starts peeling off into your food","This garlic press was great, at first. But after a month or two of use the chrome finish started peeling off the inside portion of the press. I also had the problem with the handles filling with soapy dishwater, then pouring out when using the press, as mentioned by another reviewer."
3,"handles become lose, water gets in","The press itself is perfect for garlic. The only problem is that the handles become lose and water gets in. It has become a pain to clean being that I have to remember to take it apart when it goes in the dishwasher if I want a sanitary clean press to come out. And when I do forget I usually get water leaking as a I go to put it away, and it's not clean inside because it is lose enough for water to gather in while in the washer, and needs to be cleaned again. I did a lot of research before purchasing this press and given the ratings took the chance. You can't really predict something like this will happen and its more of a nuisance than anything. I really love OXO products and hope they can fix this problem."
4,"Solid, easy to clean","I love the heavy, solid feel of this garlic press. The self-cleaning design is wonderful, and it is so easy to use since you don't even have to peel the garlic cloves first. 2 things I wish it had: more robust construction of the black rubber-y grips (which sometimes loosen and need to be pushed back into the handles), and a larger ""hopper"" so I could crush multiple cloves in one press. Regarding the rubber-y grips, we have not even put this press in the dishwasher, so I am a bit stumped as to why they have loosened up. Not a deal-breaker, but you might want to search for a solid metal press if this would irritate you."
5,Best Damn Garlic Press Period,"Strong and beautiful, this press has grates large enough so that the garlic isn't turned into goo. As I squeeze with one hand I guillotine with a knife in the other as the garlic extrudes. Nice recognizable bits. Perfect for me.Easy to clean, seemingly indestructible it will indeed multi-task as an ersatz numchuck/blackjack for those jobs where a 14"" pan or 10"" knife are a bit much."
1,Handles Come Off & Fill With Filthy Water,"The handles on this thing are hollow. They are not attached to the press. They are held on by friction. They slide open in the dishwasher, and filthy water gets in. To wash this properly, you have to pull the handles off every time and wash them separately. Unacceptable."
2,It broke?,"While it lasted, it made garlic paste out of garlic, but it snapped in half? Also not super easy to clean or anything."
2,"not for real use... great brand, just not for this product","OXO is a great line and i love most of their products, but this press leaves more in the hopper than it pushes out. Prying the leftovers out and chopping up the remains is almost as much a chore as just doing it from the get go. I own this piece of... equipment and would like to trade it for the trudeau model if anyone is crazy enough to take me up on it. Until it happens maybe i'll just go back to the old chef's knife. Spend your $$$ on other OXO stuff like tongs and can openers, not this useless tool."
3,"Just OK, not the best","This mincer is a bit heavy, its not that easy to clean and also it does not smash the complete garlic. It is just OK but I would not buy again."
2,Doesn't work as well as I expected,When I press my garlic I often get leakage of garlic juice and garlic out of the sides. There's not enough direct throughput out of the holes of the garlic press.
5,Solid unit,Seems like very solid stainless construction. I think that it is likely that we will have this unit for some time.
5,STURDY!,"Wow this thing is heaver, you could go sealing with this.Made from cast zinc I think, this works great and will last forever."
2,I have broken two of these,"This design puts all of the stress on the hinge while you are crushing garlic. Eventually metal fatigue sets in and the hinge snaps. If you are going to buy this, make sure that you have a backup garlic press."
3,Does what it's supposed to.,"Works well, but i'm not entirely sure it's as useful as it's supposed to be. You still have to peel the garlic, which is done by smashing it. After you've smashed and peeled the garlic, all you have to do is mince it with a knife. Instead, you put it into this garlic press and it does it for you. But then you have to immediately wash it under the sink so it doesn't stick and clog up. I've found myself just using a knife instead."
3,"Really heavy, lots of remnants, and impossible to clean.","At first, when I opened this guy, was impressed with the weight of it alone. After I used it, though, there is an awful lot of garlic that doesn't get pushed through the grid, and then using the built-in mechanism to clear it doesn't really do much either. Through the dishwasher after some coaxing, and the thing still didn't come completely clean.A garlic press seems like it should be painless. I don't want to think about a garlic press for longer than I am actually using it!"
2,Great....at first.,"I have owned this garlic press for about one year and the outside coating is flaking off so much that I cannot use it anymore. I am going to spend a little extra this time and get the Kuhn Rikon stainless steel press. Learned lesson once again, you get what you pay for."
2,"Easy to use, looks durable","As far as pressing garlic to a fine mince, it's fine. However, and this is important, the quality of manufacture is lacking. The first thing that happened to my press is the handle covers came unglued. First one, then the other. You need those covers to mince the garlic; under them are two metal rods - not hand friendly. Had it maybe a couple of years, more likely one and a half, and then the handle snapped off. Not impressed. Going back to the Zyliss. It may be ugly after a few years, but it lasts and lasts."
5,Wow!,"Hands down, this is the best garlic press I've ever used! Garlic always got stuck inside the container of other utensils I've had, but this one has a nifty feature in that you can swing the handle around 180 degrees to push the garlic the OTHER WAY once you're done pressing it. This way, you make sure to get all of your garlic through the press neatly, and you won't spend all unnecessary time trying to clean out tiny pieces of garlic."
5,The great garlic press,"This is the best heavy duty garlic press I have ever owned! I really do love it, stainless steel is the way to go and the fact that it is a quick clean is a postive too. In my opinion, if you give this a try and you won't be disappointed."
4,Easy To Squeeze,"I bought this to replace my Pampered Chef press. That utensil came with a separate component to push the garlic off the end of the press and to push out the leftover. I bought this press because I love all things Oxo, and I loved that the tool to push out the rest was built in. However, I miss that I don't have something to wipe the garlic off after it presses through and end up grabbing a butter knife to do it. On the up side, it's super easy to squeeze and is very effective at mincing garlic. That point makes up for having to grab a butter knife."
4,"Good garlic press, not perfect","This is a good garlic press, typical OXO. It's a solid product with the ""easier clean"" pad on it. I liked the solid feel, the size of the handle and the clean pad works alright. I didn't like the heavy weight (feels like lead) and the ""clean pad"" is overhyped--- to clean, you still have to work to get the pieces of garlic out of the chamber.Good but not excellent."
4,"Performs well, one complaint","Performs its task very well.I use almost daily.Comfortable and effective to use.My complaint: After three weeks of use, one ""arm"" keeps sliding off. This interrupts my processing of garlic and adds a step to cleaning... reassembly. I think gluing it will fix it."
3,"Works Great As Intended, But Not Very Durable","As a garlic press, it works great and cleans up very easily. A real time-saver in the kitchen for someone like myself who goes through garlic cloves like there's no tomorrow.So why did I give it three stars? The reason is that it's not very durable. Not long after I started using it, both handle covers began sliding off the underlying frame. The handle covers, being loose, also had a tendency to trap water after every wash. I eventually epoxied the handle covers to the frame--this fixed their tendency to slide off, but draining the water out of the handles now requires the press to be stored vertically, pivot-down."
3,Garlic Press,"It's well made, well designed, & sturdy. But it is too big for my hands. It is hard for me to use. . It also does not push all the garlic flesh thru the holes & you have to use a knife to scrape out left over skin. I am back to using my knife & the chopping board."
1,Not worth it,"This press is easy to squeeze but the garlic will mash itself all over the place, not worth the time or money--the first OXO product i haven't thought was great."
4,Best of Four,"I purchased 4 garlic presses to see which I would like best and OXO came out ahead of the others. Mainly because it was easy to clean, and squeezed more of the meat of the garlic than the others. The downside is it still leaves a thin layer of garlic in the press."
2,"Great with garlic, but HEAVY","This garlic press weighs a ton. It does a great job on garlic, but is cumbersome and not comfortable in my hand."
2,"Wastes garlic, and that's a sin!","Too much garlic gets trapped inside the press even when I peel my cloves first. Have to go back and nudge it out and chop or waste that bit... I'm used to OXO having much better design. I'm going to try switching to the garlic rocker, wish me luck."
4,garlic press,Did everything I expected. Clean up was easy and order arrived on time. I use it for every meal I make.
3,meh,"This press works fine. It doesn't hold a ton of cloves at once (you can squeeze about 2-3 in here, max). The built in cleaner is a cool idea, but doesn't really get the residue out, just loosens it somewhat. The finish on the inside got messed up pretty quickly (turned to a copper color in one spot). It's kind of a nightmare to clean (have to soak/rinse it immediately and even then after being run through the dishwasher and scrubbed it's never truly clean). Also the handle fills up with water when you run it through the dishwasher. For the price, not too impressed. I'm sure it would keep working indefinitely, but I'm switching to another kind anyway :p. Prefered one of the zyliss non-stick preses to this one (although you have to be careful to not scratch them)."
5,Very glad I bought it,"I was initially reluctant to pay so much for a single piece of very specific kitchen equipment. But considering how much cooking we do at home and how much of that includes garlic, this press has already payed for itself with the amount of time that it saves.As other reviewers have noted, you don't even have to peel the garlic cloves. You just pop them in whole and none of the husk layers come through.It feels extermly durable and well made. It is easy to clean. Just rinse it off with warm water right after using. What else do you need?"
3,"Does the Job, Handle Coming off","This is a sturdy garlic press and is a great design, but one of the handles is loose and occasionally slips down off the main frame. That's less than ideal, but it hasn't been a problem for us so far.The press is comfortable to use, and we use it all the time for garlic and ginger (it sort of juices the ginger more than presses it, which is great). Great for large garlicky dishes."
4,Hefty but Effective,The reviews say this garlic press is heavy and ready to do the job. It's true; you have to get used to the heft. But it squashes garlic cloves just fine and is easy to clean. Haven't had the 'water in the handles' problem reported because have not put it in the dishwasher. This sturdy garlic press will probably last the rest of my life. Hope it stays shiny that long too!
5,EASY ON THE HANDS,This is the best garlic press I have ever owned. My now retired garlic press had too small of holes giving me more garlic juice than pulp. If you don't have the strongest grip this press is easy on the hands and with the reversible plunger it makes for a super easy clean-up!
3,Hard to Clean,"I've had this garlic press for years, using it at least once a week... and it worked great for the first year. It is very sturdily made. My major problem came after about a year of use, when two of the little black plastic tines that clean out the press holes broke off. Now garlic always gets stuck in those little holes, which are fairly deep, and it is very difficult to get it out. You can't just poke it out with a fork because the fork is the wrong shape. Also, cleaning in between the remaining black plastic tines is challenging too. I'm looking at my (ostensibly cleaned) press now, and can see there is residue on the plastic part of the press. I've just ordered a new Kuhn Rikon Epicurean press, and hope that I will have more success with that."
5,I use it weekly!,"This thing crushed garlic beautifully! I use it at least once a week, and it hasn't let me down yet!"
2,ok I guess,"My first garlic press, and I was not really impressed. You have to peel the garlic, and clean it out after every couple of cloves. Just didnt seem that much quicker than regular knife method. Maybe Im doing something wrong, but for just a couple of cloves, it didnt seem worth hunting it down. Maybe if you were doing a couple heads, but you would still have to clean it after ever couple of cloves. Since the money has been spent I will use it. The unit seems well made."
5,I use fresh garlic now,"Because trying to mince garlic with a knife was such a hassle, I wasn't using much garlic, although I love fresh garlic. So I thought I'd try a garlic press. I went to Walmart and bought a cheapo garlic press (about 6 or 7 bucks). I was very disappointed. So I went to Amazon and checked out the reviews on garlic presses, and saw that this Oxo garlic press got good reviews. Bought it. Love it. Now I use fresh garlic all the time. Great product."
5,tightly squeezed,"Saw SQUEEZE on this tour in 1988-- without a doubt they were the tightest band I've ever seen live before or since. Probably thanks in part to all the great material on this album. Not EAST SIDE STORY, as everyone points out, but a topper all the way. Got a lot of airplay during it's initial release, but after that it seemed to drop off the radar. Too bad. Some great pop tunes and excellent musicianship. Any young pop musicians out there looking to improve their song writing skills would do well to study this album."
3,True Story?,"Not sure what was in the water but ""Strking Matches"" sounds exactly like it came off of the Talking Head's album ""True Stories"". Not familiar enough with Squeeze to say one way or another but, maybe the Heads sounded like Squeeze on that album?"
1,TOO BAD!,IT DIDN'T HAVE THE ONE SONG I WANTED. - (SPANISH) GREEN EYES SUNG BY BEN AFFLECK! THAT SONG WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!
4,didnt get exactly color i want.,"I did not get exact color what I want. I suggest you let us know what exactly color before send us pack of 12 lanyard with swivel Hooks. I did not get lime color, orange and white. I got a assorted color Lanyards with Swivel hooks of 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue, and 3 black. I like their quality anyway.Thank you, Carol Baker"
2,Disappointed,"As one of the other reviews states, the picture and description are VERY misleading. I bought these for my girlfriend (a very color coordinating shopaholic PE teacher) and the shipper sent 3 lanyards each in 4 colors (red, purple, yellow, and white). The picture led me to believe that each lanyard would be a different color. Highly HIGHLY disappointed!"
4,Is there such a thing as too much punk? I think not!!!,"I was listening to this album in my friend's car and I fell in love with it!!! It has songs from everyone from NOFX to my favorite, Yellowcard!!! It's a great mix that really pumps me up!!! Even if you prefer ""poser punk"" to ""hardcore punk,"" this is still a great album and I definitely recommend it!!!"
4,good cd,"this cd has a bunch of different bands on it, but my favorite was Yellowcard. they are just absolutely amazing! check everything they have ever done out."
1,Not so modern,"This collection of poems seems to be forced upon the public because the author wanted it read, not because the public wanted it. The structure of the poems themselves are pretentious in nature, daring to mimic the individual styles exhausted years ago. There is nothing new in the pages of this book, it is the same faux intellectual standard that is adored by the liberal minds that have dominated the ""cultured"" class of the past few decades."
2,nice looking copy scarred by low quality compression,"nice looking copy scarred by low quality compression: Concerning Alpha studios Raiders of Ghost city, the first reviewer has a point about a poor transfer. The picture quality is composed of small blocks and chapters 1-5 reoccurring picture blocking (the parts of picture block up), which means that Alpha used a low quality compression. This does not mean that is unwatchable, but that the reoccurring picture blocking in chapters 1-5 may be annoying. It looks better that some of Alpha's other serials. It could have been a very nice transfer. I think Alpha's hillbilly monster did the quality control on this one. Buy Alpha's copy cheap or Contact serial sellers about their copies, perhaps for a few more dollars one can get a better copy with out the defects.the serial has a balance of action and story. Each chapter is short so one does not get bored with the story line with much talking."
1,The biggest Joke of movie ever with the worst Actor.....,I cant believe that hollywood would release such joke of a film. It stars this little pint size dork who makes zoolander faces and thinks he is some karate master. That kid couldnt beat a fly on his best day. Total disaster but a good laugh if you want to see why hollywood hasnt cast a moron like this in another film since 1902. Someone needs to tell this kid to find another job.....
2,handbook of research and policy,Very dry. Keep a dictionary handy. I just bought it because it was a required book for an art ed class.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed when I got this book. I intended to use it with my first and second graders, but this being only the first year for them to have the Spanish language, they couldn't understand the words and there were quite a few words on every page. First graders can't read very well yet, anyway, so I've only used one story out of this book so far this year. It would be more for third graders because of the level that it's at. It would be nice to have an English translation for each book so when the students read it at home, they can remember what the book was about."
1,The idea just doesn't work!,"I love Baby Star products so I hate to say the Diaper Burps are... ummm... I am not even sure how to put it... not practical, that is as nice as I can be. The picture makes it look beautiful and maybe somewhere in the description it says that when you unfold it the two outside pieces are cloth diaper material and not a solid blanket. Either way, I bought it and when it is folded it is beautiful. But who wants a baby to spit up on a pretty blanket (Isn't that why we buy burp cloths?) And if you use the diaper part, what is the use of having the blanket on it. I personally thought that this would be an even tinier version of the mini and a perfect size for a newborn. Maybe that is what I get for thinking. If you buy it as a gift because it looks pretty folded, I guarantee when they pick it up and see the diaper portion they are going to wonder what it is. Everyone who has seen mine has had that reaction."
5,Wonderful,I loved this book! I would recommend this book to anybody. Be sure to get your copy today!
4,Works well,A little intimidating at first but after using a few times it works great. Just don't pull the hair out!
2,I'm just that that impressed with this clipper,"The design and idea looks and sound great. In reality, though, its performace is only average to below average. I was really rooting for this clipper though. I'm going to be back to my trusty scissor. I tried the electric nose clippers but they were uncomfortable to use. I would not buy this clipper again nor recommend it."
4,Wonderful music,"I'm new to the music of Brazil and found this album delightful. I've added ALL the tracks to my iTunes / iPod system. This album is a ""must have"" for all INTERNATIONAL MUSIC LOVERS."
4,much better than factory mount,"I'm very happy with this mount.The construction seem's to be quit sturdy and is easy to mount. I bought this mount for my whistler xtr-140 radar/laser detector.I found that when mounted to windsheild, it put my device at an odd angle and i was afraid it wouldn't work properly. I have a '06' gto and windshield is at quite a severe angle so i mounted it on the dash instead. Iv'e had this mount for about a week and have had no problems. the center console extend's all the way to the dash and is made of smooth plastic so the suction seem's to hold just fine.If you have a smooth surface on your dash, it should work just fine. Just remember to clean with alcohol before mounting to remove any cleaners or polishes. Would have given it 5 star's but haven't had it long enough for long term performance."
5,This is a great album. Another great anthology of Jerry Lee.,"This is a great collection. If you only want a few CD's of Jerry Lee, I highly recommend this album. It's classic Jerry Lee Lewis."
3,Definitely not for self study,"The exercises could be improved upon. The book needs a good teacher/instructor in order to ""come alive"" - not a book for self-study. But then again, which Finance book is?"
4,finance student,"I felt that the book was good. Some of the concepts could have been explained in better detail. I notice that on a lot of the chapters the authors repeated some of the material more than once. Some chapters need more practice problems like in chapter 5. This book explains the basic and fundamental concepts good but does not explained the difficult concepts good. Overall, this book was good."
4,Great resource for MBA program,This book was a great help in understanding the concepts and ideas of financial management.
3,Since New Edition is available - not used much now,although I got one in good shape. Did not get the CD i was promised.
1,Very poor textbook,"This is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever encountered. No doubt, the authors are very skilled in Financial Management, however they had very little skill in communicating these concepts to the uninitiated.I used this book for a Finance class in my M.B.A. program. I routinely found myself reading and re-reading sections of this book and still not understanding basic concepts. I would then give up and reference a different text and understand the concept in short-order. My classmates had similar problems with this book."
1,Terrible Book,"This book is terrible. I am an educated person, but it seems that your undergrad must be in finance in order to get any use out of it. If you are required to use this book for your graduate finance class (and you don't have a degree in finance), please invest in the study guide. It will help you a great deal."
5,Good Finance Book,Excellent Corporate Finance book.To teach finance I can draw a lot of usefull material from it.Douglas Gilson - Professsor of Simulation Models for Decisions and Strategy.
4,Excellent!,"This is no corporate finance for dummies book. So, don't expect to have ""fun"" with it. However, on a graduate level the book is near perfect. I especially appreciate its treatment of case studies - carrying the same case study from chapter to chapter where appropriate. There is a CDROM that contains, among other things, very useful and practical Excel templates for each chapter. The authors also provide foot notes that I encourage you to read. Many of them give the author's opinion of how the subject works in the real world verses the academic world. If you are the type that learns best by knowing the big picture first, make sure you get the Study Guide too.My only beef with this text is in the index, which is woefully lacking -- rendering it less useful as a research source."
4,Financial Management - Thompson,"This was a required book for my MBA Finance course. The book is decent. For a complicated topic, the book did a good job explaining the concepts. I did like the spreadsheets in the CD ROM. We had some assignments that require the use of these spreadsheets. First book I've seen where it the answer to all of the problems are in the back of the book; most books give answer to odd numbers only."
1,JUNK!!!,"I bought the Conair Pro Style 1875 dryer about 6 months ago.I rarely used it, but lately since I've been trying to save money, I've started to do my own hair at home.That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp! I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst partThe dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer. So while i'm twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i'm holding the bonnet up with the other.PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!"
1,Poor quality,"I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised. The adjustment for height is hard to use the dryer doesn't dry the back of the hair, just the front.Also, it has collapsed while she was sitting under it , so not only doesn't it work properly but it is also potentially dangerous . I would definitely not buy this hairdryer."
2,Not Impressed,I would not advise anybody to buy this product. It is the noisest hard hat hair dryer I have ever heard. It takes extremely long to dry my hair. I wanted to send it back to the manufacterer but I have no money to waste on shipping so i decided to just live with it and consider it a loss.
5,Works great!,I was actually surprised. My hairdresser recommended a home unit since I like to sit under her hairdryer and read. A great treat at home!
1,Dont Buy,Do not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap
3,Not all that!!!,PROS - Makes a good nail dryer with the air from the motor.CONS - Noisy. More airflow outside of the dryer than what actually dries your hair. Hood height is too high. Hi setting is too hot and it's too hot to the touch. Lo setting is more comfortable. Hood is not adjustable.
2,Only dries the top of your head!,I have had this dryer a few years now and I rarely use it due to its poor performance. It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly. You have to keep turning and twisting your head to get some of the air to blow on each quadrant of your head. The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably. Do not buy this product!
2,hairdryer,I was disappointed in how few holes there were for the air to come through in order to dry my hair. It appears that the product is very cheap plastic. It did dry ok but I was expecting a much better quality in the dryer.Jean Cassada
4,Doing my own hair color,"To pay for gasoline, i need to color my own hair, and sit under a dryer. This is perfect for my needs, and it is exactly as promised."
1,Terrible product,I bought this product based on customer reviews. It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product. Doesn't dry hair effectively. Hood is so high you need to sit on a stool. The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn't get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair. There are no air drying vents on the sides of the hood. Top of the head gets all the heat. Poor investment. We had to return.
1,Will never purchase again!,"Dryer does not dry my hair well at all. I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet. Total waste of money."
3,getting hotter,"Item gets very,very hot, and there is no thermostat, only vents to open on the top, and that doesnt't work to reduce the temperature. The high and low settings only regulate the fan, not necessarly the heat. It is also quite loud. What did I say? Exactly! That's my point. Cheaply made, and I am very dissapointed. Damm those Chinese. But until I can find a better hooded dryer, I guess this will have to do."
3,Satisfied,"In spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what I need it to do. I'm an African American Natural & I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments. I only gave this a 3 because it's not mobile & it's so huge to store.. Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it'd take a great deal of time but I don't use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments. But it adjusts just fine & I'm comfortable under it. You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose. I sit on the toilet w/it perched on my portable drawers I use for storage. I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I'm pleased for my intended purposes."
3,It's Okay,"It does the job.However, I owned one from years past that had a larger hood and was easier to operate."
4,Conair Hairdryer,"overall i do like my purchase, it is as advertized, i use this product every other day."
2,Poorly made and designed,"No side vents, so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot, while the sides and back are still wet. On high, it's very loud."
2,still looking for the right one,it's cheaply made. They just don't make them like they use too. I 'm very disappointedin this Bonnet Hair Dryer
2,waste of time and money,"this dryer is a waste of money, the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries. you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top it just burns a few spots and doest really affect the rest of your hair. this is only good for people with really straight fine hair. not for rollers or any types of styling ....."
1,"Waaaay Too Loud, Don't Buy",I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.
2,disappointing,"I own a 5-yr-old thinkPad and love the X31 kbd so much, so bought this kbd in hope that I can have the same typing experience with a desktop.The IBM-made label is fairly deceiving.Turns out I have to hit keys very hard--driving me mad,too bad for one that's working around the keyboard, andtry to get rid of mouse for most cases.The only thing I am happy with is the trackPoint, but thatcannot save the poor manufacturing.And finally I gave up and returned it.Waste of time and passion."
5,IBM UltraNav Travel Keyboard,"We use these keyboards for our server racks and they are great! Nice integrated dual touchpad/""eraserhead"" mouse. Nice size for the job."
1,"Worked Great, While It Lasted!","The product died in less than two years, and it only rarely went into the laptop bag (in other words, it wasn't handled roughly). It worked great, while it lasted, but when I plugged it into the machine this morning, the ""B"", ""N"", and ""(space)"" didn't respond. I discovered the keys can be popped off and replaced without damage (pop off from the top), but there was nothing out of place under the problem keys, so I concluded that it was an electronic problem...something that shouldn't crop-up in such a short time of use."
3,Mediocre,"I bought this keyboard for my desktop after falling in love with the keyboard on my T43. The experience has been mixed. The keyboard is certainly good, and if I don't use my T43 for a while I wonder how much better the T43 keyboard could be, but once I return to the T43 keyboard, I realize the desktop version has a ways to go. Note, this evaluation ignores the rather trashy function (FX) and Ins/Home/PgUp/Del/End/PgDn keys. Those are just as bad as, or worse than, those found on free keyboards.Beyond the keys, the trackpoint is a delight to use. Though light ,the keyboard feels pretty solid.For those looking for an alternative, I've tried the latest thin aluminum keyboard that Apple makes, and the keys are quite nice. It's a bit different from the thinkpad keyboards, but I think if I were willing to put that much money down for another keyboard, I could easily grow to love it. However, it doesn't have a trackpoint."
2,Lots of Features But Not Great Quality.,"SummaryI ordered one of these hoping that it might meet the same quality standards set by the last ThinkPad Laptop I owned, and whilst I was impressed by the features and ease of setup, I was not impressed by the quality of the item.Features & QualityThe keyboard is a very compact size and fits a normal USB plug. Out of the box, with no additional drivers, the keyboard, trackpoint, and trackpad were all supported by my Ubuntu Feisty box.However, the key feel quality was poor, and patchy across the keyboard, with an inconsistent feel between keys, and a generally flimsy feel. For the money, I would expect a more solid feel, much more like a real laptop.In comparison, the keyboard on my Dell M65 is rock solid and *extremely* high quality in feel. In turn this is beaten out by the Mac Book Pro keyboard."
5,Classic,"You have to give it to Alice Coltrane--she had a brand name, but did not try to cash in by coping her husband. Who knows if John would have gone in this direction with Alice had he had not died in 1967.This is avant gaurd jazz, but nothing like that of John Coltrane, who Alice played paino with in his last band, replacing McCoy Tyner. This music is big shells, filled with harps, saxes, a violin, all kinds of instruments to add to the free floating texutre. This material sounds as derived from early 1970s space rock as much as jazz.Rashid Ali's drumming did not provide enough of a backbone for John Coltrane's peicing sounds, but with Alice, it is a perfect wonder. His soft free time is perfect for this etherial music.Generic new age musicias should listen to this."
2,Shallowly shimmering,"2 1/2There is a cool cosmic vibe throughout the mystical medleys, but at the heart of these compositions lies limp dynamics and rather superficial interplay."
5,Music For the soul,"This album makes a lot of feelings face in my heart in every note the artist gives all his talent and inspiration, this cd it's simply unique by it's own style, it will make you relax and forget all your troubles just to enjoy this passion for the soul it's music, I love Piano but with this artist I live Piano so congratulations, this is music!!!"
3,Hypothyroidism Type 2: The epidemic,"I listened to Dr. Starr on a radio program, thought his book would be a ""must buy"" Its easier to listen to him than read with understanding all he has to say in the book. Somewhat technical for my taste. Will continue to read it at a later time."
1,Feedback,"Really, this was more about the Dr and people he met over time that solutions to this problem. I read it all but did not take away much."
5,helping patients with hypothroid disease,Two conditions were mentioed in the book that brought to mind a few patients. I have caled them and we are testing the protocols presented by Dr. Starr......I shouls know the results in two weeks.
5,Hypothyroidism Type 2: The Epidemic,"An amazing book !Dr. Starr offers an explanation as to why health issues, that so many of us are experiencing today, are on the rise.It is based on years of research, test results and the author's personal experiences.A real eye opener as to why the thyroid is called the master gland of the human body.If you are someone, who wants to find answers to your health issues... when lab test indicate..""nothing is wrong"" , the solution may be provided in this book.A great gift for your health care provider as well.This book hit home for me !Betty"
3,Informative but Repetitive,"Would have enjoyed the book more if it was more concise. Still, worth the read. Believe the premise is correct - there are a lot of us with normal TSH lab ranges but have the symptons for hypothyroid. Disheartening though as it is very difficult to find a doctor who will prescribe thyroid hormone if one is in the normal range."
3,Interesting but,"I have read about 8 books on hypothyroidism and visited a number of websites. It is clear to me that the orthodox medical community's apparent belief that they know all there is to know about the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism just doesn't hold water.Dr. Starr is the second author I have read who's clinical experience has uncovered clients with hypthothyroid symptoms yet who's thyroid blood tests are normal. It's something that at some point the medical community is going to be forced to confront and research. The first author, Dr. Dennis Wilson saw more than 5,000 patients that fit this description. There are differences in two authors theories about what is going on. I side with Dr. Wilson's, but never the less this book is informative and useful if you fall into this diagnostic 'black hole'."
1,Short sighted,"The book starts out well, but the author shows his relative ignorance about alternatives to increase thyroid hormones without the use of dessicated thyroid. It is a hard pill to swallow (figuratively) that the only treatment is a lifelong regime of dessicated thyroid. Historic evidence of other societies other than Anglo-European shows a definitive lack of interest in science that may disagree with his hypothesis. This book calls to light the problems associated with hypothyroidism but does little to show how we actually arrived at this state (for example, why do we not see hypothyroidism in hunter-gatherer populations?). Read this for some useful information, but don't freak out with the doomsday conclusion(s) that the author offers."
1,I dont get this book,"I dont understand why this book is so highly rated with other readers. Although I appreciate historical context, the writer repeatedly refers to studies and photos of patients that date back to 1910-1960's -- so much so that I keep double checking the publishing date of this book (2005) because I was wondering if this is a reprint of a 1960's book. Over and over, the book shows Xrays from 1924, 1918, 1957, photos of many patients from 1915, 1940's-1950's .... really, do we not have any more recent medical evidence/studies ???In my non-medical education opinion, this is a strange book and I dont recommend it."
2,Dissappointed,"I bought this for a friend. She said the book is just a ""history"" of the disease and doesnt offer any insight as to how to treat it naturally."
3,Everyone has it.,Book was sent on time. Condition of book was great.Content of book leads one to believe everyone has Hypothyroidism. I went ahead and got an exrensive blood test by my own Endocronologist which came back negative.
3,Covers the subject well!,Shared the book with my physician after highlight subject areas of my concern. Doctors are taught to use medical testing that the book says does not indicate a problem when there really is one. Dr. Mark Starr claims too many people have a thyroid problem that is not diagnosed. Doubt the book will change doctors' minds.
5,Finally a book on hypothyroidism that can be used!,"Finally a book that explans why hypothyroidism cannot be diagnosed solely by blood tests. Doctors in the 21st century should take note that their patients are running out of patience with their lack of answers to some vague epidemics such as ""chronic fatigue syndrome,"" fibromyalgia,"" and ""depression."" I advise doctors that they need to ""go back to the basics"" of listenng to patients and being openminded.Thank you, Dr. Starr, for you are a doctor who ""gets it"" and who makes complete sense!"
1,this book is awful,"unless you are already comfortable with xlib programming, save your money. look elsewhere. this book will NOT make you a better xlib programmer. it simply takes the place of the man pages and has some examples to supplement them.it makes no effort to teach anything."
1,HILLBILLIES FROM HELL,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! And the book sucks to! I think if anything it makes poor people look like scum! I grew up poor, but cannot relate to any of the stuff that the beans go through. The movie is really bad, but also really hillarious. So if you are lookin for a great laugh check out Forbidden Choices, and the book The Beans of Egypt Maine."
2,4 months old & having Screen Issues,"We've only had this tv for 4 months & all of a sudden half of the screen went white & other half went almost completely black. We are waiting for service now to see if it can be fixed, but I would not buy this brand again.Very disappointed as paying $800 for tv & this should not happen.I would not recommend."
5,Wonderful gospel,"This is a wonderful gospel soul CD. If you grew up in the '70's listening to Al Green, you'll love this CD. I listen to it over and over."
2,Money Man,"Al Green definately has some good music but unfortunately you won't find any of it on this album, also I'm not just saying this because he ""charges admission to his church in Memphis""."
4,Perfect for a Little Girl!,"My four-year old received this game for her birthday. It was an immediate hit! She loves playing tea party, so this was a perfect gift. The rules are easy to follow too. My ONLY complaint is that you have to wait until your spinner lands on a plate to begin - and it took a long time (even for us adults)!"
4,"Even if there is no one around, there's always a party","Even when my daughter is not in the mood to play the game, she will still set up the tea party, tablecloth and all. It's so cute and the instruction card is well set for how a table should be presented, and matching all of the place settings is an added bonus for small detail recognition. Overall, we love this"
4,Wonderful Fun Game,"This game is great for younger children (3-5 yrs). It is simple to spin the spinner and select food items, but teaches them patience and selecting items in sequence. The game is also short enough to retain a 3 year old's interest and easy to play more than once (if she doesn't win the first time!). The tea party theme probably appeals more to girls, but my nephew enjoyed playing this as well. We've given this game several times as birthday present- it is reasonably priced and not on every discount store shelf so it makes a wonderful gift!"
3,Certificate holder,"Were as described, were only moderate value for price. Suggest using with tape to hold certificate in place"
5,Certificate Holder,Very nice quality standard 8.5x11 certificate holder - creates a much better presentation than just handing over a certificate and protects it from soiling and damage until properly mounted.
4,"Very Good, But...","The certificate holders addressed an urgent need and provided a color choice that I could not find elsewhere. They are attractive and made of good quality paper. A few negatives -- They are smaller (height and width) in size than most certificate holders, which was a bit of a surprise, but I erroneously assumed that certificate holders were standard in size. Also, the weight of the paper seemed somewhat light -- not unusably flimsy, but not as sturdy as the brands that I am accustomed to using. Further, the price was a little high compared to other brands I have purchased in the past. However, on the plus side, this set of certificate covers was the the perfect shade of green for my purposes, had a nice conservative design, and although smaller overall, they accommodated the standard size certificate."
3,Not enough to pass,"The Server+ Bible gies an excellent overview of the topics covered on the CompTIA Server+ exam; however, you will need more than this book to pass the exam. The exam questions are scenario-based, so you'll need to know how to integrate all the topics covered in this book. Most of the end-of-chapter questions are much easier than what you will see on the exam. You may want to really focus on the scenario questions provided at the end of each chapter. You can never know enough about SCSI for this test, so supplement this book with research on SCSI devices."
5,Excellent practice test questions and not a dry read,"I am glad to read other peoples good reviews of this book. I purchased my copy in Mid July when it first came out and so far I think it's great. The best part of this book are the practice test questions. They are the best ones I have seen so far. This book is not ""dry"" like most study guides I've read but very easy to read and understand. The author really knows what the reader wants and gets to the point of what you need to know for the real Server+ exam."
5,Best of the best,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt this is the best book on the market to use forthe Server+ exam. I used this book for a month to prepare myself for theServer+ exam and I passed just as the rest of the people who used this book.I can see how the other authors of the other Server+ books are trying to putthis book down with their bogus reviews If you lookat the other server+ books out there on the market you can tell bycomparing them with this book which one is on target and which ones are notmost of the authors of the other Server+ books are not even Server+certified (what does that tell you?). The author of the Server+ Bible isServer+ certified! The Server+ Bible is the best of the best for this examby far that is why everyone who uses this book passes!! I did along with the10,000+ people whobought this book!Think about it!"
5,Server+ SKO-001 On target,Being a teacher in this field I was very happy to find a Sever+Certification study guide that was right on target. The other server+ booksI have reviewed did not cover the exam objectives fully or the author wasnot clear on what he/she was trying to get across. The Server+ CertificationBible is totally different from the rest. It is very clear with explainingeach exam objective fully and does not stray like some of the other booksand teach you stuff you do not need to know for the exam. This book doeshave it all and is right on target.
1,Definately NOT RECOMMENDED,"You don't have to look far to find errors in this book. There is an error on the front cover. The Exam number is listed as SKO-001 (S-K-Oh hyphen zero-zero-one), the real exam number is SK0-001 (S-K-zero hyphen zero-zero-one). All of the other Server+ books got the exam number right, why didn't this one? The exam number is right there on CompTIA's web site.This book is absolutely full of technical errors. It has its share of typos as well, but today what book doesn't? The author's style is also a little annoying, but I guess that is a matter of personal taste."
4,Easy to read AND understandable,"This is truly an easy-to-read, common sense book! The CD that accompanies this book is pretty straight forward with tons of practice questions as with any study guide CD. Form all of the study guides I have looked at this one I recommend because it is very exam focused and leaves out the unwanted babble."
1,full of mistakes,"this book is FULL of mistakes. not the simple typos or grammatical errors that other reviews mention, but quite often getting the basic concepts incorrect. STAY AWAY from this book."
4,Better then the rest,"This book has been really good so far and a lot better then some of the other Server+ books I have looked into. I understand that this is the first print of the book so I did find a few minor issues in the text but nothing major that I would say would hurt your chances on passing the Server+ exam. Almost every other study guide I have has some sort of minor errors in it, it can only get better with every new print. I liked how I could find each objective marked out in each chapter, it makes it easier for me to study that way. Out of all the Server+ book out there this is the best."
2,This book is okay,"I read this book from cover to cover and found more then a fair share of errors. The one being that a 1U server is 1"".But when all was said and done I passed the SKO-002 Server+ test and the data base of 264 questions were helpful. I would not buy this book if your palanning on passing the test and have not study and passed the A+ and have networking under your belt. You won't"
2,Good material/ Bad exam prep tool,"I studied the material front to end. Aced every test on the book's attached test engine. However, I failed the Server+ exam on February 2004. I was confident by passing the book's sample tests (averaged 90+) would prepare me for the test. WRONG! The material is good but the actual test is very tough and the attachged test engine does not prepare you for the test!!! I will now try a different book and test engine to prepare to take the Server+ exam once again. Someone suggested Mike Myer's Server+ and Exam Cram..."
4,Good Study Guide but for the old exam,"This book became my primary study reference for the Server+ exam. It was inexpensive on the Amazon used market which compelled me to get it. Since I was an A+, N+, and Security + before starting this older edition I knew that the newer technologies were not given adequate coverage. I used this book with frequent web/wikipedia searches to successfully address the subject material. Only a few errors found. I recommend this book for experienced IT people. Less experienced folks should probably pay the extra money and get the current edition."
3,Too Many Typos,"While the information was informative, there were so many typo errors. It was as if the book was in a rushed to be published. I found the errors distracting because I had to go back and read certain parts over and over again. I also just came from taking the test. I scored a 73%. I needed a 75%. There were about 8 questions on the test the book did not cover; and I read the whole book - some sections twice. I felt the practice exam was not a good representation of the type and quality of the questions that the exam ask. However, I do feel that this book provided some learning benefit."
2,Out of Date Don't Purchase,"This book was written over 13 years ago and as other reviewers have noted, the typo'd SK0-001 (not SKO-001), is obsolete and the current exam, as of this writing, is SK0-003. Since this book was written the IT industry I have worked in for 24 years has graduated from parallel SCSI drives to SAS hard drives, memory has evolved to DDR3 DIMMs, mult-core processors, 10 GB Ethernet switches, WiFi 802.11 ac wireless connectivity and that's just for starters. If you need a historical piece this book is for you but for the price it's hardly worth it. There are some more current Kindle books that cover parts of the of the current SK0-003 Server+ exam and price is not reflective of quality. Do your research."
4,Watch outlasts strap,"This watch is great, so when the strap broke, I bought a new strap for it. Unfortunately, the pins on the replacement strap aren't as strong as the original, so it fell off my arm one night while biking home. So, I'm buying a whole new watch. I really liked the way I could cock my wrist and turn on the indiglo feature without using my other hand. That was handy. And it looks good - this watch got me to switch back into the watch wearing community again."
5,Great watch,I use this watch for work and when hiking. The back light is grat the numerals are clear and easy to read. Good price too
1,DOA / Replacement lasted Six Months,"To bad it did not work. I think it is a manufacturing problem that does not let the stem engage to turn the watch on, because if you press on the stem it operates. Great size for medium frame men, good face and case, and the military time is readable.Update: Do Not buy this watch!!!"
3,It's ok at times,"The watches look is great, it looks simple yet effective. I wear the watch almost everyday because it looks so simple yet it sends the sleek message. The only issue i had with it is that i had to send in a defective one because it stopped working and only the indiglo feature worked. The second one did the same thing but after i dropped the watch once it worked and i had no issues with it. Overall, i believe the watch is worth it."
5,"Lays relatively flat, looks good, works well.","Having a watch with a low profile is important to me. I get annoyed when I notice my watch due to it catching on things (like sleeves and walls), and this watch is one of the flattest (and therefore least interfering). It is not the flattest that I have had, but it beats about 85% of the competition while still staying affordable and reliable."
3,Goood for what it is,"This is an inexpensive, but quite decent watch. What do you expect for $30? My only reservation is that the strap is not the ample. I am large boned and have thick wrists, and it barely fits. It may stretch a bit over time, but if it was just a little longer, it would accommodate a lot more people. The lighted dial function is nice. And of course, because it's quartz, it keep excellent time."
4,"like the watch, battery lasted 10 days","What can I say, it is a Timex Expedition. Looks nice. Battery lasted ten days. Should have known something was up when it started losing time after about five days. Not sure what the deal is but I went to Walmart to get a battery put in. They ruined it so gave me one off the shelf. Same price as Amazon."
3,BUENO,"Recibí el reloj en perfectas condiciones, me gustó. Sin embargo, no es en realidad como se ve en la foto, la correa es de un color claro, no cómo se ve en la fotografía de la propaganda (un color obscuro acorde con el color de la esfera, que es verde oscuro), eso me desepcionó, deben revisar la foto y colocar una que se ajuste a la realidad, o mandar un reloj con el color de la correa que se ve en la foto."
1,Poor. poorer. poorest service!,"Amazon was previously selling this watch through a vendor, 'watches4u.' I noticed this watch was selling at a very good price, cheaper than it is now just two days ago and I ordered it. Unfortunately, Amazon/Watches4U sent the wrong watch, a cloth banded, digital that sells for less than $20. I called the Amazon customer service and received no help whatsoever. The rep couldn't speak English and I think I was talking to someone in Calcutta some place.One glorious waste of time, energy, and money. I fault both Amazon and their vendor on this one!!!Just be wary of what you are ordering and from whom."
1,It ran fast,"I had always had good luck with Timex, but not with this watch, though. I found that the watch ran fast. It would gain about an hour over a 24 hr period.I returned it with no problem at all. Then, I bought a Casio Atomic watch from Amazon. It is doing great."
2,not bad,"watch is good , but it is a lot smaller than though. should be sold as a ladies watch. would never have bought it knowing what i received....."
5,Great watch for the price,"You cannot ask for more than a watch that is handsome, has an Indiglo lighting feature, and a calendar function, and costs less than $40."
1,Just about destroyed two laptops,"I installed two of these cards on my Mom and Dad's laptops. One, a Compaq Presario running Windows ME, became completely hosed after the install software destroyed the registry. I'm going to have to reinstall the whole machine.The other, a Dell Latitude running Windows 2000 Pro, goes into an endless reboot loop if the card is plugged in. Both the HW and SW are junk in my opinion."
4,"Didn't work at first, but AMAZING customer tech support","I felt the need to write this review just to compliment the amazing customer service I received. I actually bought this at a warehouse type retailer, and of course you aren't going to get any technical support from oneof those places. I called the 800 number and (GASP) got a person who was polite, helpful, and very patient with me as he walked me through upgrading the firmware. In this day & age when customer service is an archeological relic, they were amazingly helpful, responsive, and effective. I have had no trouble using it in my house with the D-link wireless router, and I use it at a distance of >120 feet from the base station regularly."
3,CHEAP is RIGHT!,"This card lacks the ability to sense SSID signals. You have to tell it the network is there. Also, while it is Plug-and-Play friendly with Win XP, the Dlink utility that comes on the CD-ROM doesn't work with XP Home (crashes when installing), so there is no way to control the level of WEP. I can only get this card to work with my Linksys WAP _WITHOUT_ WEP."
2,no way,"I bought my fist DWL-650 card and it lasted 3 months and quit. I have to mention that during that 3 months it worked perfectly with 50 feet of range (indoors). I called D-link and returned it. They found it to be faulty and sent me a ""new"" card. This card set up and worked fine but I can't go further than 10-15 feet from the D-link router and I loose the signal. The tech support is pathetic and it takes them a month to repair/replace your card."
4,Easy install - seems to loose the connection from time to ti,"I'm using my D-Link DWL-650 with D-Links DWL-1000AP. The combination seems to work just fine.Installing the PC-CARD was easy. Don't follow the manual if you're on NT - just install the driver, reboot and plug the card in. It works great from there.Only minus (why I only give it 4 stars) is that it seems to suddently drop the communication, even when there is full signal. Which high-bandwidth requirements, I have to rescan for the Access Point about every 5th minut - as the Tx and Rx goes to zero.Which normal use (surfing, network stuff etc) I haven't seen this problem yet."
1,Not ready for XP,"It appears that this product is not yet compatible with Windows XP. After trying for three days and talking with technical support, no luck. Tech support must not have even read my question to them. I reported my results based on an answer in their FAQ, and all they did was send me a copy of the FAQ that I was questioning! The configuration utility won't work with XP and their was no way to set a couple important configuration parameters. I purchased a Linksys wireless adapter and had it up and connected to my D-link DI-714 in 10 minutes."
1,wjcunning,"Bought two of these. One for XP, one for a WIN98 box. Simply awful product. Stay away at all costs. This is the first and last D-Link product I'll ever use.As an Electrical Engineer, RF systems specialist, and qualified AIS consultant, I was confident about using this product, and expected it to work well. WRONG.Simply look around the internet a bit, you'll find TONS of people having problems with these things.I spent 2 hours on the phone with D-Link technical support. Waste of time. The technician hadn't a clue how to assist. After spending a lot of time, and getting frankly awful performance from these cards, I gave up and put them on the shelf.Save your money, find a better product. These things just aren't ready for prime time."
2,UNuseable range in my average-size house!,"I also can ONLY get about 40 foot range (thru walls) in my house. Not enough, so I returned it. Looks like TONS of these (and Access Points) get returned (at Fry's). Does ANYONE know IF any brand of these cards will work 100+ feet INSIDE a HOUSE???"
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS CARD YOU'LL BE SORRY,"Purchased 2 DWL-G650 1 worked after updating OS, one did not. Configured second laptop for working card then took the bad one back. Same card same number except it with a B2 Firmware the working one was an A1 firmware. Installed software did not work had to uninstall and install the new software. Now it is installed and indicates it is working but receives nothing. Called tech support....Forget it long distance and I waited about 20 minutes before hanging up. Sent email no response. Taking them both back today and buying a linksys. My fault tried to go cheap and got what I paid for. I already had a linksys and should have just stuck with them.I don't believe that D-link has a QA department, which becomes apparent with the product and software."
1,Not compatible with IBM Thinkpad T-Series,"This thing stunk. It installed ok, but never connected with the AP. I gave it to a friend to try out and it worked fine on his. My T21 Thinkpad would not power it up correctly, so I am now using an Orinoco Gold - great card, great features."
1,Don't buy this product,I bought the access point and PC card and had a hell of a time configuring it on NT 4.0 on a laptop. It just doesn't see the wireless access point and I tried all manner of things for several hours. The range is also extremely poor -- it didn't work more than 50 feet and a few walls away from the access point.Do any of these things really have the advertised range?
2,Works ok for a low end card. Otherwise look elsewhere.,"I had this card along with a linksys, and a orinoco. The Dlink was not built well, in fact it broke just a week ago. The orinoco is without doubt the best for reception as well as physical stregth. Orinoco is packaged under names such as Dell True Mobile, IBM High Rate, and a bunch of others."
1,"poor documentation, poor quality","I happen to have a Toshiba and Dell laptop. I could not get the card works with them. Neither can the tech supports. I am frustrated to have to spend more than 2 full nights just working on installing. The documentation is poor, difficult to understand, might not even accurate and does not even provide NT quick installation guide."
2,"Crashed Windows XP, intermittent problems in W2K","Even the latest drivers from the web site dlink.com crashed Windows XP at a client site with a blue screen error, so I ended up leaving the client my Orinoco Gold PC card, which worked right away. On my laptop, the performance is on and off, at one point I was only able to access certain sites but not others, until I uninstalled a bunch of my software, then it continued to work fine. I will never by this card again. Why bother? For almost the same price you can get an Orinoco card. I would go for that instead!"
1,Doesn't work in Sony Viao,"Brought this for my Sony Viao. Doesn't work even with latest driver download from dlink website. But works flawlessly on my other laptop; IBM Thinkpad 600. Email support from dlink website is useless and slow..., 2 days response time per question."
1,Check your bus speed!,"Be absolutley sure that you have a 16-bit bus or this card will not be compatable with your computer. If you do not have a 16-bit bus you will have a 32-bit bus. You will need to find a wireless card that uses 32-bit bus speed.Best of luck!P.S. Trust me, this happened to me!"
2,Awful Range,"This is a good card for someone who's going to use it in an apartment near your Wireless Access Point. Otherwise, if you plan on using it in a public area like a Starbucks, a university or an airport go elsewhere. This card has A LOT less range than a 3 year old Linksys card I'm using on the same laptop. Don't use the CD when installing on XP, but run windows update while the card is in the slot... there is a XP certified driver there, although I haven't noticed any improvement in range. Overall, it's better suited as a doorstop rather than a Wireless card and the tech support is really awful as well."
2,D-Link DWL-650 very poor range,"I have a Belkin wireless router/modem which works well with a Belkin PC card. I also allows me to work with an HP5550 hand-held all over my house. However, only about half of the house is usable with this D-Link card and my laptop. I am very disappointed in the range although in other respects it is OK."
1,D-LINK DWL-650 DWL 650+ D-LINK Support BAD BAD BAD!!!,"I use XP. I bought D-LINK DWL-650+, it works with the D-LINK DI-614+, but cannot work with the wireless network in my school with the latest driver. But it is strange that the old driver can work in my home and school. I sent e-mail to DLINK, they only reply your first e-mail without any valuable suggestion. Then you never can reach them. I call D-LINK, the man was so bad ... I bought two D-LINK DWL-650, I cannot setup it up in my computer. I have to return them. I will never never buy any any product from D-LINK. Product is bad, support is bad ... company will vanish at last. Believe me!!!!"
3,Can anyone tell me if my PCMIA lot can use this card?,Can anyone tell me if my PCMIA lot can use this card?
1,No Range,I've had a wireless connection in my house for three years and after getting a new computer and connecting it to this card my reception is terrible. Even 20 feet away the signal is weak. You have to sit next to the router to make this card work so you might as well just plug in.
3,Okay for a budget,"I needed a card that would help me get a signal from a basement to the second story of a house. This card gave me 3 out of 5 on signal strength, and in some places didn't get any signal. I read about a lot of cards and ended up getting an Orinoco card instead (I got this one in a package purchase.) The Orinoco card is more expensive, but it gives me 5 out of 5 for signal strength everywhere in my house. If signal strength is a concern for your use, or your going for max distance, you may have some problems with this card."
5,Plugged in and running in 10 minutes,Worked like a charm. I used the CD distributed with the card and followed the directions for Windows XP and didn't have a single problem.
4,"Works perfectly, but a bit of a nuisance","I bought this card and use it successfully on an IBM laptop. I only use it at home (a small apartment), so I can't comment on range.It works well, and installation was easy enough. One nuisance, though. Since I use encryption, I can't set the network to be default, but every time I turn my computer on (or come out of sleep mode), I have to go into the setup utility and press ""apply"" to approve the encryption key. There's no way to set a default key that would kick in every time the machine is turned on.Good product for a low price."
4,Great Affordable Card,"Mainly going to use this card to surf the internet at Cafe's, airports, etc. Great little card, set up easily on my old old laptop, connected to network easily and away I went. Great card for old or new laptops"
2,No Good for windows XP,"Certainly not my best purchase, recently.The linksys was out of stock, so I bought the D-link.I've nothing bad to say about the company in general, but buying this card for windows XP was a mistake.**Some** reference to XP should've been made in the packaging, and a more obvious link to the drivers should be made on their web site.I'm using the card now, but it took a bit of investigative work to find the new driver and install it correctly AND Win XP is now giving me an occasional error when it restarts. Also, complains when I try to return to a hardwire connection (even though I reboot in between).Perhaps there's a reason why they've (D-link) not yet received the Microsoft XP seal of approval.I'm sure there are better cards to be found.Our home has 8 computers, a few of which we built from components; we're serious computer users, yet I just spent a half a day getting this new card to play nicely with XP, and I'm not sure I've succeeded."
3,Do not buy for use with an HP or Compaq laptop!,"This was the first D-Link PCMIA card I've owned, and they have both been good performers, except they interfere with Windows' power management features on HP and Compaq notebooks. I thought the problem would be solved by buying this newer card, but it hasn't. My computer refuses to stay powered on for more than 20 minutes unattended, and frequently, when browsing the Internet, my mouse cursor freezes and the only way out is to hit the power button. I did some online research, and it turns out many other HP and Compaq laptop users have had the same problem. For some reason, these incompatibilities still exist, despite D-Link knowing about them for some time.Again, D-Link cards perform well and are a good value, but I would not recommend one to an HP or Compaq user."
1,Terrible Customer Support and Terrible Quality,"At first, it worked fine. However, after 3 months, it stopped working and I got the error code 10. I called customer service several times (>=4) and every time I had to wait for more than 10 minutes in queue. They gave me absolutly unhelpful advices: reinstall card and reinstall driver. Attempt several times, Eventually I got a RMA number to exchange it. They do not accept US mail, so I had to send it via UPS and it costed $8.(40% of purchase price). After one month of wait, I got another card, which looks like an old one. I guess they sent me a repaired one. Unfortunately, this one does not work at all!!"
2,Good price but hardware issues to be aware of....,"Purchases a DLINK DI-713 access point and DLINK DWL-650 pcmcia card. The AP works great but the PCMCIA first did not establish a connection for my DELL laptop with Win XP on it. Tech support spent 2hrs with me trying to resolve but was unable to. I then tried to install on my other DELL laptop with NT4.0 and now the PCMCIA port on that laptop is toast. Not a great track record for software and driver installations, but their support is very helpful and their hardware seems well made. Stick with an 802.11 Intel or Linksys pcmcia - which may cost more but cause less grief."
1,This product is a big pain!,"First off, if you don't follow their install instructions to the very letter, you're in for trouble. Requires lots of reboots to get it working. Second thing, the cards work well communicating to other DWL-650 cards in ADHOC mode, but will not communicate in ADHOC mode with either the Lucent Orinoco Gold card or the Cisco card. Third, could not get either of my two DWL-650 cards configured to work with the Linksys wireless router in infrastructure (AP) mode, even after verifying all configurable parameters and using the latest drivers and firmware. Finally, one of my cards heats up in the laptop and stops working -- I have to pull it out, wave it around to cool it off, then put it back in. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT -- YOU WILL REGRET IT! Even though this card uses an industry standard Prism II chipset, the design around the chipset is obviously substandard."
1,Wireless Range is not as declared,Everything works fine with this product except that the wireless range is much shorter than specified. Connection drops often in a distance just two rooms away on the same floor or from upper stairs to down stairs.
2,Don't buy this !!!,I installed it in my laptot. Everything is fine EXPECT it always disconnect about 3 esconds every minute. Quality is not good. I used my laptop just near my wireless access point (2 feet far) .. and it got disconnected sometimes.
1,Does not work,"I bought 2 DWL-650's and the DI-713P gateway, after a pound of flesh I got the gateway up and running, I had to re-load the firmware and reset the hardware. But the cards never worked on my Windows 2000 machine. I would load the drivers and then insert the card, walk thru the wizard and my machine would then reboot and keep on crashing after every login. Tech support was awful, and could not help. I ended up borrowing a Lucent Orinoco card and was up in minutes.D-Link has poorly written, crummy drivers, stay away....I returned both DWL-650's"
3,[Inexpensive],"As one of the lower-priced wireless PCMCIA cards, the DWL650 is definitely worth considering in a 'budget' 802.11b network.However, WinXP users will need to carefully select the correct driver from dlink's ftp site (the link mentioned in a previous review is *still* not corrected as I write this) in order to avoid several hours of unecessary frustration.Once up and running, the DWL650 works like most other 802.11b wireless products on the market today (variable range and consistency given different installation environments)."
3,"Decent in w2k, but not for XP","I got this card working fairly quickly on a Windows 2000 laptop. But on my XP Pro laptop, it kept giving me blue screens at boot up. In W2K, the range was fair....but nothing to right home about.A decent card to use if only using Windows 2000 or another previous version of Windows."
4,D-Link generally is ok,"I have the D-link router 614+ and the DWL-650, among others. First, they are priced okay. Second, they are easy to set up. Third, the web-site support is pretty decent. I'd bypass the phone tech support because of the same problems other reviewers have cited elsewhere, but this limited tech support is generally true for all of these low-cost items. Lastly, however, the range is very limited. I'd have the connection dropped off intermittently 2 floors up/down or 2 rooms away from the router. I'd probably buy it again, nevertheless, because other made-for-home products (e.g., Linsys) are more or less the same. One must recognize its limited range, which is a lot less than advertized."
1,Don't buy it if you want the customer service,"Simply put, if you are expecting any customer service at all for this product, then buy something else. This company is notorious for the bad customer service. The product is ok if it works on your system."
3,Finding right drivers for XP a pain,"I had similar problems with ""blue screen of death"" crashes, and failure of the card to work unless I uninstalled and re-installed XP drivers from D-Link web site with every reboot. I found out that ""XP drivers"" linked to from D-Link web page (DWL-650_0307) are not correct drivers. Go to the ftp page (ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Wireless/DWL650/Driver/) and download dwl650_driver_f51. If you use this as only XP driver it seems to work although occasionally still a little quirky."
3,Windows Xp problems,"I got it to work the first time, but when I reboot with the Card inserted my computer crashes. If I reboot without the card inserted and then insert it after my computer still crashes. The only way I got it to work is to disable the driver, put in the card and then enable it. The driver download for XP has a problem. Other than this it works alright but the range is not as great as you might think."
2,Incompatible with Win XP?,"As of this writing, there is no Microsoft approved windows XP driver. Dlink claims that the unapproved driver will work, but in my experience it didn't. The control panel shows it connected, and it seems to send packets, but not receive them. In fact, after I installed the driver for the card, DHCP stopped working properly on my 100-base-T card's IP stack. In fact, even after uninstalling the driver, DHCP is still broken. Not sure what's going on, but I suspect this card's uncertified drivers have something to do with it.If you're running XP, I recommend before buying an 802.11 card that you check the vendor's web-site to see if their tech-support says something like ""Windows will warn you that this driver might make your system unstable. But don't worry about that. Everything will work out just fine."""
1,Could not make it work,"I tried to install a Dlink wireless setup. First PC, a NT 4 WS box (with SP6 installed as required) would only blue screen at boot time with the card installed.Tried on a Win98 SE box but drivers would never load properly.Sat on hold for tech support for 1 hour and decided I did not need this kind of grief.Bought Linksys gear and it all plug & played as expected. NT box is happy, Win98 box is happy, Toshiba (4 years old) laptop with Win95 is happy.Sorry, D-Link sucked on this one."
2,Not Suitable for the Road Warrior,"If all you want to do is use your laptop on the front porch, or in an unwired office at work, this adapter may be fine. But if you were lured into wireless by the promise of high speed internet access in airports, hotels, coffee shops and such, it is virtually worthless. To connect to a network, the DWL-650 must be specifically configured to have the same SSID (identifying name) as the network. That is fine if you only connect to one network and you know its SSID. It is a nuisance if you want to connect to several networks and have to reconfigure each time. It is fatal, however, if you want to connect to a strange network and do not know the SSID. Networks that are intended to be open to the public use ""broadcast SSID"" to send the network ID over the airwaves. Adapters that can receive broadcast SSID can then automatically configure themselves to log on. The DWL-650 cannot do that, and there are plenty of other comparably priced adapters that can."
5,Performs as Stated and Easy to Install,"This PCMCIA card was very easy to install and I was able to configure it in about 5-10 minutes. It Performs just as well as it is supposed to and I am happy to have found that it is truely 802.11b compliant.A friend of mine has a wireless network at his home also and with a little settings change and a reboot I was able to connect to his computers.Recommended to anyone who has a laptop and access to a Wireless network, or will soon have access to a wireless netowrk."
1,bad range,I recently bought two dlink cards; the pc card version and the pci version to create a point-point wireless LAN. I was very disappointed with the short range; much below the advertised 50-100m. I had a lot of trouble getting the PCI card to work in my PC. Eventually I had to use a different motherboard since win2000 would freeze right after bootup if the PCI card was installed. Even when I got everything up and running I found that the range inside the house was very bad. I was getting absolutely no connectivity at 100 feet (33m) through walls. The advertised range is upto 100m (330 feet) indoors.I ended up returning both cards. Wasted time and effort... do not recommend a purchase unless all you want is connectivity within a 70 foot area.
1,It crashed 3 different computers on install,It didn't work for me. I tried it in 3 different laptops - 1 XP and 2 ME machines. It crashed all 3 - I never got it to install. I couldn't find any patches on their website and D-Link customer service never responded to email technical support requests. I returned the card. Love the Amazon return process! That was the best part about buying this card!
2,Poor connection/signal quality,"I bought this card off a yahoo.com store. It does not always connect to the available wireless network. It is not even compatible with Windows XP - the installation says so, it is not digitally verified by XP. While it is able to detect the network, it just won't get connected. I use it on my campus' wireless network. While people around me can connect to the network using their wireless card, mine just refuse to do it. Although sometimes it does connect, this is not a very reliable card."
4,I believe my opinion is useful for you,"I read all of the reviews here before I made the purchase. I believe I can handle this card finally. Here is my final points after 4 hour's experiment on it:1. This card works great in any MS operating system except XP.2. For XP, it also work great, but needs a little trick.... The control utility coming along with this card never works under XP under any circumstances, so do not bother test again.It works great in any other system except XP...."
2,doesn't support 128-bit encryption,"Although the card worked (with my SMC router/access point), it does not support 128-bit WEP as advertised by D-Link. I have to return the product as I need the 128-bit to be able to use the card at work as well as home.I like the card, just not the fact that D-Link says they support 128-bit encryption when they don't. I called D-Link support and they acknowledged the discrepancy."
2,Their web suggests good linux support but...,The chipset in this model changes from revision to revision. When I checked their web I got the impression it had good linux support. Before I purchased I also got the same impression - but that was for some other revision of the card.So - the two stars is for that. I have no reason to believe that the hardware is not just fine - but I feel like D-link misled me into thinking this card had good linux support.
2,Pretty Shoddy,"I suppose the range etc. are fine - I haven't tested it directly against other cards but qualitatively performance seems fine.It has an annoying installation where you have to have the CD-ROM available at the same time as the card. If you are installing on a laptop without a CD-ROM, by sharing the drivers from a networked CD-ROM, this will make installation more annoying and mystical.It has a very stupid and irritating constantly brightly flashing ""active"" light during normal operation.It installs a utility which can only be run by administrative users, but tries to run itself under any user, so that normal users get a stream of error windows filling their screen. It's very stupid in this day and age to assume that everyone on a machine will have administrative privileges.All in all, a thoroughly disappointing purchase. I've had good luck with D-Link products before, so the general lousiness of this particular one surprises me."
3,Good... but you'd better have Windows XP,Good card - works just as well as a Cisco - but I faced installations problems with Windows 2000. Windows XP worked just fined though - so I upgraded my OS.
2,Weak Wireless PC Card,I bought a D-LINK DI-713P Wireless Router to use with the DWL-650 and I was very disappointed with the 650. Signal degradation was immediate (30%) after only 30 feet. This was with Encryption TURNED OFF! I tried using another brand wireless card and was able to go all over my house (over 2000 sq ft) without any dropped signals. DLink makes a great wireless router DI-713P. Too bad I can't say the same about the DWL-650.
3,An ordinary wireless PC Card,"I've bought both the 1000 AP and the DWL-650. No problems at all getting it hooked up.But as this was my first hands-on experience with wireless LAN's, I got a little bit disappointed when doing some benchmarks. First, I cant get more than about 5-6mbit. Secondly, my CPU-usage goes up to about 80% when transfering data (without WEP enabled). After some investigation on the net I found that a maximum speed of 5-6mbit is what you should expect.Im really disappointed of the CPU-utilization. On my system I get about 10% CPU-usage with every 10mbit on my 100mbit NIC. Over wireless I get over 10% of CPU-utilization for every 1mbit.Surfin the web and so on works nicely. But watching a highresolution movie is a no no because of the CPU-utilization.My system: Dell Inspiron 8100 1.13GHz P3 WinXP"
1,Easy install.. but whats the point?,"I will agree that the install was great.. NO issues at all.. However, if I have to sit UNDER THE access point to get reception then what was the point of wireless?? I could have just as easily ""clicked"" in.. I was VERY unhappy with the product.. But the uninstall was easy too.. maybe they knew something.. :)"
1,Drivers do not work well on WinXP,"I could not get the configuration utility to work with Windows XP. I had to use the built-in settings in WinXP to get it to work. Event then it would work only sometimes. It seems to work better on WIN98. I have wasted a LOT of hours trying to get this thing to work. It seems to have a stronger signal then earlier DWL-650 cards, but that is useless with faulty drivers."
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could,"I have built networks before, I am not an utter moron...nevertheless, couldn't get this freaking thing to work at all. After an hour on hold with tech support (not told free), and another 45 mins with the guy simply telling me to restart over and over, support told me to return the product.is no good"
1,Do not buy this product,"I purchased this PC card (2, for a 2-member home network) and the DWL1000 Access Point. The two machines were running Win2K Professional Workstation, app. 60 feet from each other on the same floor in different rooms. My main problems:1. Initial setup was difficult due to poorly-written documentation.2. The access point only registered on the console machine when I connected it via a crossover patch cable to a standard Ethernet NIC.3. The remote machine never transmitted to the access point.4. ALL my attempts to get tech support (email, phone) were frustrating and ultimately fruitless.The network never went up. The entire project was a waste of money and a good deal of time. I am a network administrator and consultant, and will cheerfully embrace any opportunity I can find to steer clients away from this company."
3,It works good in toshiba but not compaq presario!,"good connection with my netgear routerbut once i plug into compaq presario 2800, it halt"
4,buen zapato de paseo,"buen zapato de paseo , cómodos, transpiración y ventilación por su malla muy buena, suela cómoda en amortiguar pero no posee tracción es solo pa pasear no lo recomiendo para actividades intensas"
4,"Good shoe, Could be better","Adidas products, all around, will rarely disappoint, and neither does this shoe.The megabounce has good support, a firm fit, and, most especially, is not over padded like so many shoes these days. My only gripe is that there seems to be extra room around the ball of my foot, so there's an occasion for some slippage. If you have a normal sized foot, you might want to try these in narrow.The bottom line: Although a great shoe, I'd recommend that you spend $20 more and get the full sole megabounce (no slippage)."
2,Looked better than they are !,"They looked like they would have lots of cushion, but the sneaker was hard and after a break in period they were just OK. They also had a flat sole witch did not work for me."
1,"OMG, save your money","OMG, PEOPLE, SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is not the Heaven sent we all remember and love, it's a very bad cheap immitation, not to mention they're using a box for a 2.5 oz bottle for 1.5 oz! If you already have this, look at your box and see if there isn't a 1.5 sticker over the original size. You see the box, and how big it is, then pull the bottle out and it's SO SMALL! Do NOT pay this much for a cheap immitation, save your money and buy a perfume at Belks!"
2,doesn't compare to original,doesn't smell like the original heaven scent nor does it stay with you..sent disappears after a while. Have to reapply
2,Grand Champion,"The quality of the CD was excellent. However, the soundtrack songs were not what I expected. They were ok but for much younger people.George Krecidlo"
2,A terrible waste of time-- just look at the pictures,"While the photographs in this book are fabulous, the book itself is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly researched. There are many typos and grammatical errors in the text. Most of the ""research"" was just taken from other books about the Talking Heads. The thing I find most offensive is that the book is titled, ""The Stories Behind Every Song"" but the ""stories"" are no more than guesses made by the book's author as to what he thinks the songs could be about. ""Oh ummm David Byrne was PROBABLY dating Adelle Lutz when Speaking In Tongues was recorded so I think she was the girlfriend in Girlfriend is Better!!"". Ridiculous! This book is total trash. Leaf through it for the pictures at the store, but don't waste your money."
1,A waste,"This book is pretty much worthless. There are some snippets of band history that are interesting, but the line from the title ""The Stories Behind Every Song"" is completely misleading, insofar as I was expecting _the band's_ take on their work. Instead, the author provides us with his pretty lame and obvious interpretations of the lyrics. I suppose this book is OK if all you want is the historical pictures of the band, but the text is weak at best."
1,Among the worst books I have read.,"I was expecting research and interviews, or at least quotes from other interviews. Instead I got descriptions of the songs and sometimes wild conjecture or ridiculous interpretations of the lyrics. Example: the title Found A Job has nothing to do with the lyrics. Huh? The writing ""style"" is on a middle school level. How did this get published? I'll keep it for the pictures only."
1,Lazy writing,"We're led to believe that the author is going to discuss the songs. For many of the songs he just quotes a line from the lyrics, and describes the sound. He doesn't offer much to us other than that.A lot of the song descriptions last only a paragraph or two.The pictures and the biographical information about the band members was fun, but the book was a huge disappointment to me.In my opinion, this was some very lazy work."
1,Bookmans is the WORST,I ordered a book from Bookmans over a month ago and never received the item. They don't allow customers to track a package so who knows if they ever sent it because they refuse to contact me about it. Don't order items from this company!
5,I don't know how he did it.,"This is one powerful book. It's so heavy in parts, I wanted to just throw it away and pretend I never even picked it up. But I had to keep reading it. I had to finish it. I highly recommend this book to any thinking person. It will change you."
2,Didn't do it for me.,"I know this book represents an enormous commitment on behalf of the author, but it just 'didn't do it for me'. The first twenty pages of 'inferior white boy' I took with a grain of salt, ya know, it's a book about the world of non-white gang bangers, so I endured it thinking the rest would sort of springboard off of that...it didn't. It's an interesting book, just too one sided for my taste. I mean, you could be talking about giving away free gold bars or the second coming...and I'd want both sides represented. Didn't happen here, at least not to my sensibility.Also the writing style, to me anyway, seemed like it wavered between a fictional novel and a nonfictional narrative, kind of all over the place. I didn't care for that and found it distracting.This is a quality book, but I didn't care for it for the reasons mentioned above."
3,Interesting premise,"The idea of the book is a good one, and it must have been a crazy experience. The way the author transcribes the gangbangers' speech is completely obnoxious, and it's just pages and pages of the same thing happening. 3 stars for the premise, and for being free it's worth a shot."
1,jjkjjk,I didn't like the book. also I will not be rating any more books as I love to read but don't have time for this nonsense
2,Not quite as described,"I have an identical design towel bar that needed replaced badly in my apartment (and our super sucks so I'm doing it myself). However although the packaging claims it is 30"" long, the bar itself is actually 28"" long and so my replacement will be obvious since the previous towel bar was not only screwed in, but glued to the apartment drywall."
2,"Missing parts, bar is less than 30""","I bought this to replace a towel bar that is 30"" long; however despite the description of this item it is only 28"" in length. The package was missing the screw covers. I wrote the company, but they did not offer any help to send the missing parts, etc"
3,bad hardware,Nice towel bars. Poor hardware for installation. We had to go to the hardware store & get everything new to put them up. Why bother putting hardware in the package if it doesn't do the job?
4,"DATED, but good","Written in 2000, it is 2011 by my watch. I open it at least twice a week. BADLY in need of an update. I would drop $50 if you would do the update, Al."
5,Ford Mustang 5.0:,"I have a 1989 mustange gt, and this book really did teach me a lot about the car. The book is really going to help me down the line when a problem occurs with my car. It is the best 5.0 reference book i have found."
4,Truly one of the Deepest Cats,i always dig the way the Brother writes be it in this Book or when He is talking about things that happen back in the day or today.he has a way of tying things as one&making His point.this Book brings the flavor&Realness on the subject matter from start to finish.
2,misleading description!!!,"The manual indeed says the unit takes 10 hrs/230v or 20 hrs/120v for a full recharge. A full recharge will only supply enough power for about 30 minutes. Though I don't have much problem with the long recharging time since I use it at home any way, but be aware before purchasing!!!"
4,Airplane Fun,This is a good toy for either a boy or a girl. It's rather cute too. Well made and good for parents to use with even younger babies.
5,Best air mattress hands down,Best air mattress I've purchased (and I've purchased many). It inflates it's self with the aid of batteries and stays firm all night no annoying separate pumps or blowing it up by mouth.
5,Fantastic Food,"My budgies absolutely love this food! It is especially good for female budgies, though it is a good protein addition for male budgies, too. I definitely recommend it for anyone with budgies, especially females, and especially egg-laying females."
3,"Good first novel, but....","I love the qurkiness of first novels, but this one suffers from ""muddle in the middle."" That doesn't make it a bad book. It was quite readable. What bothered me perhaps more was that it was marketed as a fantasy novel without a clear element that could be called ""fantasy."" Other than taking place in another place and time, there wasn't really anything of the genre in the book.For a truly excellent first novel published in the genre in 2000, take a look at Carol Berg's Transformation.That said, I'll read Ms. Klasky's other books and see how she progresses as a writer. She clearly has some very interesting ideas."
3,just ok,"I had no problem with the writing style or the basic plot. It would have been an enjoyable read except for one problem: the main character. I agree, she is selfish. But even worse, she is just an idiot. She is one of the stupidest characters I have come across in literature. Her choices are completely irrational and confusing; we are given no reason why she acts in such unbelievable ways. I prefer to read about characters whose actions are based on the their personalities and experiences, not random choices for the sake of the plot."
3,Where is Rani's common sense?,"The GLASSWRIGHTS APPRENTICE is about a 13 year old apprentice that is in the wrong place and time. After witnessing the death of the prince, her guild, her family, her career, her life, she latches on to the hope that her only remaining brother will help her; although it's clear to everyone her brother is a evil, murderer and the secret society that he his caught up in controls his life. It felt like the bad horror film where you cannot possibly believe that the characters could be so stupid. What made this book work was Rani's friends that she meets along the way; you could feel their compassion, and goodness that they tried to impart into Rani. The story is entertaining, and I will read the next, even if it's just to see if Rani develops more common sense."
3,"Promises much, but not quite making it","Of the many writers breaking into the field, it takes a great deal of time and patience to build up a world and a character with which readers will struggle and triumph. This world is tangible and alive. Secondary characters give more to the inner eye than Rani Trader, our manuevering heroine, provides.The story is provocative, but Rani moves too easily among the castes. A simple addition of syllable and she is one caste or another. This makes me wonder why there are not simply multitudes of people hopping from caste to caste as it suits their needs.I enjoyed the story, and agree fully it is a grand effort and shows promise for the author. Still, with no passion for Rani's lack of major struggle, I can not give much of a higher rating. It is hoped Klasky will flesh out the main character more in the next effort that I am awaiting with anticipation."
3,Girl at the well,"This tale is cute in the disappointing sense. Although the flyer for it reads well, the story line is very trite. Every culture seems to have a tale about a girl/woman at a well that is looked down upon by others; yet, that same low caste person is elevated by a religious figure later in the tale. That is in essence what this tale embodies. I would recommend the book to younger readers, but not for a well read person. It could be useful in a college prep English class where readers must constantly be aware of the smallest symbology so that they can write a paper. This book is overloaded with things that can be referred to in a book report, but not of much interest otherwise."
3,quick read with some smart points,"The world in the Glasswrights' Apprentice is well-structured and interesting. Klasky has clearly given the city a lot of thought, and has a flair for working out its design. She also gets a lot of credit for not weighing down the book with an unwieldy amount of magic. The characters are significantly less well-developed, and their motivations and ideas are clearly secondary to the plot and the ideas with which Klasky began the book. Unlike other readers, I found no real problem with the character of Rani as such. I think that she becomes unsympathetic largely because we see what happens to her rather than what she makes happen.Glasswright is still a quick and entertaining read. There is enough promise here to pick up the second."
2,Depressing book,"Pretty depressing book. The basic storyline sounded interesting and somewhat novel, so I bought the book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its promise. For one thing, it was just to0 depressing. Also, I agree with the other reviewers, I really couldn't get into the character. It was decent writing, but there were no redeeming qualities to overcome these two major flaws. Don't read it. It's a waste of time."
2,Not Great,I just didn't find the book very interesting. I found it long and rather dull; lacking in action and too confusing to follow at times.
2,Not so good...,This book has a realy good cover but gets realy boaring. I started this book three different times and was only able to make it half way. The turn of events just isn't that interesting.
2,"A couple of good ideas, but...","I'm a big fantasy reader, and I picked this book up because the book quote on the first page absolutely intrigued me. However, the plot goes somthing like this: An apprentice to an artisan's guild is framed in the prince's murder and subsequently brings down everyone around her, and then has to work her way back up. The basis was great, I really liked some of Klasky's ideas. One of the little details I loved was the set up of the caste system in Rani's (the heroine's) world, and I also enjoyed the set up of the princes murder. But after that, the book really petered out on me. The plot stumbled about aimlessly, and the end left me UTTERLY unfulfilled. I really truly got the feeling that Klasky got bored with the book and wanted to finish it off really quickly (I know I did), so just whisked out a cardboard ending. Still, it was a good learning experience for me on what makes or breaks a book."
5,Bitingly Funny,"Having lived in the most liberal city in Iowa for close to ten years, this would seem like satire if the characters weren't just like people I'd met. If you can imagine Grant Wood meets ""The Osbournes"" with a healthy dash Joe Friday and Charles Manson, you'll get a good idea of what Carl Houseman's world is like.Some mystery stories are good. Reading a nice Agatha Christie you sort of puzzle your way through and get to the end and feel, ""well that was very nicely done."" Reading a nice Harstad is more like watching the Munsters move to middle America.It's funny and short enough to read in a day or three. It won't make you rethink your life, but it might make you rethink the idea that small towns are boring little places where nothing ever happens."
5,Harstad - The Real Thing,"I am a retired police officer, having served for over 33 years in large and small jurisdictions. I was surprised when I began Harstad's book. I thought to myself: "" This guy is one of us or sure has a great insight"". While the story is fanciful, it was very well written and ""gripping"" throughout. I paid close attention to the language, the actions, the thought processes, the insertion of humor (sometimes of the 'graveyard-type) and case development. All these things were right on the money. I have and will recommend Harstad's books to other officers - active and retired. I also recommend his books to you if you are interested in both a well written, interesting tale as well as a peek into how ""cops"" think and act. Both thumbs up!!"
4,A most likeable cop,"With the title it has, I would never have even picked up this book if my sister-in-law hadn't given it to me because it is set along the Mississippi like KEEPERS OF THE RIVER. Yes, it's a vampire story but don't expect a real one. Too bad. I think the story would have been more intriguing if the vampire turned out to be genuine, but I suppose the author didn't want to risk leaving the mystery genre. With the hope of finding a Midwestern Dracula, I waded into a maze of technical police stuff but was carried along by amusing dialogue and a most likeable cop, Carl Houseman. He is an unique and engaging character. Unfortunately, the others are not so readily pictured and the ending was rather anticlimatic."
2,It is ok,Not real in to this book. There is a lot of art in it which tends to be hard to read. I would think a child would have a hard time reading it because words are everywhere. Just not much to say about it except I don't like it.
5,Pet hair...,This is great for getting pet hair out of the corners and from the places where the risers meet the stairs. Not much else to say-- it just works.
1,Dyson Stiff Bristle Brush,Package comes with the brush and adapter. The adapter does not fit the DC-07 because the brush attaches directly to the nozzle. Very disapointed because both pieces are cheaply made plastic and I end up paying for an adapter that does not fit the machine!
5,GREAT TOOL!!,THIS IS A GREAT TOOL FOR THE STAIRS. IT HELPS THE FIBERS TO LOOK NEW AND NOT A TRACKED OVER PATH OF FOOTPRINTS.
5,"Gets that dirt, dust and pet hair around the edges","This little brush is great on stairs - carpeted and uncarpeted, and going around the wall to wall carpeting at baseboards and in doorways - places where the vacuum cleaner can't go or won't pick up. The dust and pet hair that build up around the edges of rooms always make the floors & carpeting look dirty, even though it has just been cleaned.The brush's stiff bristles are strong enough to stand up to the floors, rugs and carpeting without scratching, although I would not use it on silk area rugs."
5,Very handy attachment,"Seems like this should have been included in the set of attachments. But even though it wasn't, it's worth the additional $ to have it! Great for all sorts of little corners and baseboards too."
4,necessary,A Dyson added piece requested. I do not know how this attachment will function since it was sent as a gift
4,Use it all the time and happy with it.,Bought this to replace the original brush for my Dyson because the original got lost somewhere while I was cleaning things here at the ranch. Anyway.... This one works just fine. Just don't loose the attachment clip for my Animal 17 or you will be up a creek and have to buy another. My only disappointment is that I can't store it on the vacuum caddy because it doesn't fit.... Oh well.... Maybe I will find the original and use this as a back up.
5,Great preservation of American history in documentary form,"This double DVD set is worth every cent. It is a great recording in documentary style. The film preserves the oral history and stories surrounding the truly American form of singing called Sacred Harp, or Shape Note singing. The film is filled with touching moments and amazing community feelings. Parts are humorous as you listen to Southerners try and describe making sense of the ""rabbit food"" brought to pot lucks by Northerners. The film leaves you with a deep sense of pride and an interest in preserving this uniquely American form of music and communal bonding. I could envision my own children learning this style music and was amazed at the passionate following and joy it brought to other young people who spoke or just appeared in the film clips. It left me wanting to do what I can to learn this form of communcal singing and preserve it for the next generations."
2,"Pleasant, but sort of long","Having thought that 'Awake My Soul' was to be a two-disc CD set of Sacred Harp singing, I was surprised to find that it was a DVD set that had to be viewed rather than heard. The first DVD centered upon interviews of many individuals concerning how they became involved with Sacred Harp singing. Of interest was the portion concerning the development and history, with brief samples of singing in church U.S. colonial times.The second DVD consisted of actual singing from several congregations in southeastern U.S. While very enjoyable to listen to, after the first hour, I wondered if they would ever run out of songs. The exposure was very informative, and I would no doubt feel comfortable in giving it a try, but I would have liked a little bit more introduction to the reading of the notes."
3,cast iron tea set review,purchased as a gift. was much smaller than expected and the color much darker than the picture. a bit misleading. might return
3,Great set but wrong description.,I ordered this set as a gift for my mother. As you can read by the desription it is stated as being red which was the perfect color for my mother's kitchen. Unfortunately when I received the set it was dark brown. After emailing the seller I was told that I could return it under the terms stated which would have cost me a lot of money. My mother liked the set enough to keep it but just be careful if buying from this seller.
5,Chef! is absolutely delicious,"I love to watch these over and over. And, it's the entire series--every episode. Each time I watch them, I hear something I missed the time before. Lenny Henry is brilliant. Many of the lines are worth repeating. When arguing with my husband, I often steal Chef's quote: ""Your silence is disturbing eloquent"". Five stars!"
5,Excellent!,"I received the dvd package in a couple of days, well wrapped and in good order. I bought the ""CHEF!"" series as a gift, so I did not view them, however, when I hear from my giftee, I will let you know. Thanks"
2,Unfortunately it has a laugh track,"I admit, I have only watched the first episode of Chef but I am disappointed so far. The jokes are mediocre and, very unfortunately, it has a laugh track. A really annoying, loud, ""laugh here cause it's funny"" laugh track. It would be much better without it; I don't need someone telling me when to laugh.I will watch a few more episodes but, so far, not a great series. I keep hoping for another Jeeves and Wooster, that show was great and didn't have, or need, a laugh track."
5,The Most Erudite Chef Ever!,"The great thing about this series is the dialogue: a wide range of vocabulary with impeccable pronunciation! In addition, the supportive cast has personalities ahead of its time. A female sous-chef, an independent managerial spouse and a Jamaican kitchen person. The relationship between the chef and his spouse shows how a couple can have violent disagreements and still make it obvious they love each other. Too bad it didn't go beyond three seasons!"
4,Chef finds perfection on DVD,"This collection is yet another example of the quality of British programming that has found it's way onto dvd.While some of the humor is dated, Lenny Henry could easily give Rowan Atkison (especially as Blackadder the third) a run for his money with his furrious rants.The dvd extras are a little slim but in this age of content I may be a bit spoiledif you are into britcoms your collection would not suffer from this addition."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Awful. Only made it through 2 episodes. Definately British so-called ""humor"". Would not make my enemies watch this. This sounds like a harsh review, but this was the kindest way I could put it."
1,IT'S UNBELIEVABLE !,"The exhibitor was describing that it is a ""Like New"".But I was surprised because the commodity arrived.In this CD, there were a lot of detailed wounds, and a similar new article was not at all the one that was able to be said.There are several skips, too and I am a betrayed ."
1,Don't waste your money,"This magazine is the biggest rip off. I wouldn't even call it a magazine. In total it is 29 pages and there are 2 articles totalling 4 pages. The entire rest of the magazine is advertisements. I bought this magazine based on reviews I had read that said it was full of color photos and details about the island. The photos are all advertisements. So, basically you're paying them to send you junk mail. Don't buy."
3,jvc gr-dx307,"I got it a week ago i took it to my son,s play the whole room was dark except for the stage the video was pretty good for just turning it and recording but when I got it home that was a differnt story the low-light shooting was bad that was before I used the nightshot when I turned that on some how it started recording in slow motion and was very very dark right now im still trying to play around with it and thinking about sending it back before my 14 days are up."
3,"Nice camcorder, problematic firewire","I really like the overall functionality of this camcorder. I've been very pleased with the quality and ease of recording. However, I've had a fair number of problems connecting it to my PC via firewire (USB was no problem but gives mpeg 1 output - think webcam). After a lot of hairpulling and harsh language I did some more research and found out that this camcorder has problems with firewire cards that do not use a TI chipset. So, if you want to use firewire to get high quality output for burning DVDs of your recordings be aware that this might be an issue."
2,"Fine design style, but operation sucks","I purchase this camera december 2004, i really like the design stlye its amazing. After a month or so the zooming start to malfuction, if i zoom to say 10X the camera start to unzoom its self back to 1X,. Because of this shooting a video is really hard beyond 1X, i have to keep using my finger to try an keep the zooming steady. At that time i figure it was a function of me not knowing how to used it so i did not return it then. After reading the manual a few time i realized its the camera's fault so i sent it to JVC. They call me to say the need $150 before they can start to look at it. I realy feel rip-off, i have not even get $50 value use since i've got it and i have to start spending on it already. I really made a mistake in buying this camera."
1,no talent band,"this band has no style to there music. The song the pain strikes is a really bad song. Just look around is a cd that is flat out, and has no special sound to it. Don't get this cd, get a cd that is worth listening to."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT.......Omits too much to be truly helpful.,"I have studied yoga, ayurveda, vedic astrology and gemstone healing. I find Ronnie's book to be ""watered down"" in information to appeal to the mainstream tropical astrology reader. It is big on generalities and light on applicable individual analysis. I consider this a ""pop-psychology"" overview of various healing tools that are available rather than an endeavor allowing one to obtain a true reading of the Self. Too many very important variables are not considered to be of any real value in a serious attempt to understand the Self and healing one's spiritual, mental, emotional and physical issues. Any of Dr. David Frawley's books would be much more helpful and beneficial to the serious seeker of truth in search of knowledge and understanding of oneself."
3,Another White Misfire,"White continues to disappoint. I liked his first book but every subsequent book has been wanting in one respect or another. Granted, his books grab you at the very outset and keep you reading, even though the plots are overly contrived. And White keeps inserting his pet social peeves throughout the books to the point where you wonder whether he is more interested in entertaining readers or indoctrinating them. So, by the end of his books, you're so tired of overlooking his failures and excesses that you feel let down. This is a typical Stephen White book: Starts off with a bang, then spirals into unrealism. It's like eating cotton candy. At some point you feel the need for real food. White has it in him to be a much better author. I hope he succeeds, but this offering comes up short."
4,Another clever and well-balanced mystery from White,"Alan Gregory is my favorite of the shrink detectives out there. I find his mental explorations refreshingly free from tabloid science, and while he certainly deals with the extremes in human nature it still stays in the believable range._The Program_ is an excellent series entry and a little bit of a change via its alternating narrators. (Alternating narrators are almost universally done poorly in mystery novels-- this is the well-done exception to the rule.)Points off for some unnecessary plot convolution near the end, but overall great characters and worth the time to read."
3,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Dr. Alan Gregory and his wife Lauren are two of my favorite reoccurring characters, but they take a back seat in this story. The tale begins on an interesting note, but the pace soon begins to lag. There are some interesting characters here, but for some reason I just couldn't connect with the main character, Kirsten/Peyton. The first person narrative seemed awkward to me. I kept reading because I was curious to learn the outcome of Lauren's pregnancy. I was rewarded with a short, fast paced conclusion, but the birth of Lauren and Alan's baby was glossed over. I have enjoyed most of Stephen White's previous novels, but this one just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,He does it again.,I have never been diappointed in one of Stephen White's books and was not let down this time. It brings back old characters and introduces other good characters. Very good book
2,Worst Ever from Stephen White,"I have read all of Stephe White's books. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of them......except The Program. The Program was slow moving, boring, and did not have nearly enough attention on the main and usual characters: Alan, Sam Purdy, Lauren, etc. I couldn't even finish it it was so boring, and usually I can't put down a White novel until I'm finished."
4,Many layered plot - worth the read,"This was my first experience reading Stephen White and I was a bit impressed. The plot had many layers and kept me guessing, which is what I like - I didn't know what was coming next. There was not one predictable thing about it. I hoped like hell the good guys would win, and wasn't sure who the bad guys were and how many of them there were! The ending was a bit over the top, but I was so far into the plot by then I got a kick out of it. I enjoyed the humour he interspersed throughout, and really enjoyed he descriptions of Boulder. I've alread bought another book of his and will be reading more of his work, and have recommended him to my friends."
2,All over the place,I'm sorry. The Program just couldn't hold my interest. The plot was all over the place for me. I found myself skipping sections that seemed to be filling space.I also found it to be very predictable. I probably won't give author White another chance. Too many other authors excel at this genre.
3,"slow, but picks up at the end","This is my first book by Stephen White, and I think it might be my last. The book is slow to get started, until maybe the last hundred fifty pages or so. Keep in mind, this is a 400+ page book. The characters are well developed, but there wasn't enough depth to anything to get me excited about them. All in all, a slow, slightly suspenseful novel"
4,good whale/bad whale,"a harrowing damsel in distress thriller with an inside look at the problems with implementing and living within the witness protection program. dr. alan gregory, the sensitive nineties kind of guy therapist who is the protagonist of this series, plays a relatively minor and uncharacteristic role in this installment: he is called upon to act out his macho side. well above average."
3,Not his best,"I am writing this for those familiar with Mr. White and his series. While he has reduced the gratuitous politcal slaps at anything right of Al Gore in this offering he has traded that annoyance for the EXTREMELY annoying and distracting device of heroine Kirsten/Peyton's memories appearing to her as whales. An otherwise probably best of series,this book is very degraded by this device. I'd certainly recommend it but I'd trade any three unread White's for any Ridley Pearson....or Dennis Lehane...."
2,Far From His Best,"White isn't a great writer, but I've enjoyed all his books because of his characters. This book, however, is simply boring and the writing is even worse than usual. A very big disappointment, to say the least."
2,Annoyed,"This is a disappointing effort from Stephen White. The plot is totally unbelievable, and the characters are one-dimensional. I especially found the daughter to be beyond irritating. Please--no more kids in these books!"
4,Distopia and government control meets knowledge lover,"It's always a shock when you find what you've believed since you were young is not what everyone else in your community believes to be true. Blay Raytee can't remember her parents or where she was from. She was placed in a government-run orphan work camp where they learn how technology users are evil and have to die in order for prosperity to return to the earth. She is afraid to go outside without a protective radiation suit. Things all change when she is chosen by the ""bio-indicator"" to be her assistant as she prepares for her trials. Blay begins to learn how different the world is from what she was taught in the work camp. She is drawn into a secret world as well as learns how to love for the first time. She also grows to understand her own value and her own hidden secrets. If you like ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, then you should enjoy this book."
4,Ten years after the fall of Ceausescu,"Bel Mooney has managed to get to the heart of the problem that foreigners have of understanding the pain and anguish that people felt in the darkest days of Communist Romania. A mother sent her child away in order to save him. She wasn't looking for material improvement in his condition though that was sorely needed but she wanted him out of a morally corrupt system that was likely to engulf him as he grew up. Her novel sees the child travel across Europe. Eventually after the fall of ""the shoemaker"" she is able to leave Romania and after much heartache traces him to Paris. The novel ends with her return to Romania in optimistic mood. I wonder whether that optimism was well-founded!"
5,the best cookbook around,"I bought this cookbook on the advice of my grown daughter for a bridal shower gift. When I recieved it, I wished I had ordered one for me,too! I plan to do just that. It is great for beginners and seasoned cooks as well. It has wonderful tips and asides that make planning so much easier. I recommend it whole heartedly."
5,One of THE best cookbooks that I own!!!,"Actually, my mom bought me this cookbook when she was at a Southern Living party about 2 or 3 years ago. I haven't actually ever closed it since then. The recipes are easy to follow and most are basically foolproof, plus, there are nice little cooking hints and tips all throughout the book. The best part is that there is nutrition information for every recipe. Recipes are also divided into ""Family Favorites"", ""Grilled"", ""Healthy"", and such. Oh yeah, there are also pictures which is always a plus."
5,One of the best cookbooks around,This cookbook is absolutely full of wonderful recipes. Most of them are easy to prepare. I'm going to be cooking from this book for a long time with many of the recipes becoming family favorites.
5,This is one of Southern Livings Best Books,This book is excellent for recipe content and photography of recipes. Each recipe I have tried so far is delicious. I have collected Southern Living recipe books for years and this the best one.
5,Best Cookbook Ever,This SL cookbook is always the first I go to when I'm looking for a recipe. I have over 200 cookbooks and none can compare to this book. I even have the 2nd series and it still isn't my first choice. I love it so much I bought one for each of my 5 daughters. LOVE IT!
5,First Time using Amazon.com,This was my first time to use Amazon.com. The cookbook was received in excellent condition. I will definitely shop here again.
2,Waste of Money!,My daughter doesnt like it..the chairs are too small and the bins doesnt seem to hold anything bigger than crayons..
2,"Weak attempt, though well made; filmed, to exonerate a criminal family!","Read Gary Allen's book for the definitivetreatment of this criminal family, who isstill at it! Ninety Year old Dav Rocke-feller was just at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada'sBildeberg Meeting [see: Jim Tucker's Bil-derberg Diary, also!}"
2,More Costumes Than Faces,"While this book displays some wonderful ideas for face painting, the focus seems to be more on the costumes and props that go along with the concept. I do face painting for large groups of disadvantaged children (at homeless shelters, special events, etc.). Therefore, I have only a brief amount of time to paint each child's face. I usually show the children the book and have them pick out what they'd like to be. But they would be very disappointed in the final result if it doesn't look like the wonderful images in the book, which are enhanced by the costumes. Many of the pages in this book are only devoted to creating the costumes (often without any face painting even involved). So it doesn't suit my purposes."
5,Great,"I loved the simplicity of the writing. Yet any child that hears this tale will identify with the hero, who dutifully tries to help but fumbles every job. Truly an enjoyable book."
2,Cheap Portable Music,"I'm frequently working away from home and need some musical entertainment to keep me company. This little box isn't great. It's compact, perhaps too compact, with sorta tiny speakers that sound tiny. There is no ""bass"" or ""treble,"" only ""presets."" I haven't found a preset that makes the sound better.It seems to work fine and the CD player works flawlessly. It arrived without any obvious defects. It's just not very good quality sound. For the price, I guess it's okay. I think I will spend a few more bucks next time. I expected more, even at this price, from JVC."
2,"Great Beginner Book, that's it","If you are considering buying a cat or have never sailed, this is a fine book. Info on standing up the mast putting the sails on, etc. If you know anything about sailing (can leave a spot and hit land somewhere else), this isn't the book for you. Tons of generic information on buying a boat, sailing and turning a boat. Hardly any specifics on any boat. I was very dissappointed. I was expecting a little bit on batten tension, rig tension, etc. Book briefly covers mast rake, shifting gears, and other itermediate set up techniques, but does not give much specific information on ""if you do this, this will happen"""
3,Catamaran Sailing: From Start to Finish,"This book is aimed at a novice sailor, covering all the basics about sailing, such as various points of sail and tacking and gybing. I did find information that I wanted in 2 chapters about sailing cats off the beach and surfing cats. So if you are a novice, a very good book, if you are experience, seek other sources."
2,Definately for beginners,"And I mean BEGINNERS! I have about 4 years sailing keelboats and thought this would be a good ice breaker for cats. Much of the boat was simply too basic. With a little common sence and a week on the water, anyone with half a brain could figure out these things by themselves. If you've EVER sailed ANYTHING or have watched two or more sailing movies (I'll even throw Water World into that) this book isn't for you. That, and there was only one picture of a SolCat!"
4,Very Happy,The book is like new and arrived in a very timely manner. I am so pleased with this service
4,Good Comedy,"A really funny,educative,clever movie of people and their habbits as strangers have been united by prostitute serving and meeting them in different situations."
3,Good for the basics,It is an awsome book to start because explain the basics of working with crystals.I am satisfied.I recomended to everybody that want to have an idea of how crystals work.
5,"An important work, it shares a sacred tradition.","The author clearly states the importance of self clarity in one's work with crystals. He quides and encourages the reader in personal and mystical paths. Luc Bourgault shares his knowledge and love of all living elements, programming the book as carefully as he guides readers in the programming of crystal work. Well done."
3,disappointed,"I expected a lot from this book but it is poorly made, very wishy washy... Very few stones with a very short paragraph for each..."
1,What do real Native Americans think?,"According to the highly respected website, New Age Frauds and Plastic Shamans, the author of this book is not Native American. Go to newagefraud dot org and enter his name in the search."
5,Best boot,I recently bought this boot at a local store due to a sale but I love them so much that i wanted to write a review. I had to buy them 1 whole size smaller then my normal shoe size. I really hope people see this online since it suprised me when at the store when trying them on. But once i put them on i basically havent taken them off. They fit wonderfully and are very very warm. I have been walking through a foot of snow and not any snow got in my boot/ i didnt feel anything. So they really work. They have the ankle support too incase you happen to need that. I plan on wearing these boots for years to come.
4,"Comfortable, strong boot","This boot is comfortable and strong and gives good ankle support. It's waterproof, but I haven't had any problems with breathability, as long as you've got good socks. I'd recommend it highly, especially since it's pretty warm. It may take a couple of weeks to break-in fully and become totally comfortable."
1,Dont Buy these Imports,Used these boots for 30 days and found that the seam below the lower lace eyelet was ripping apart. I returned the boots for a refund ASAP.
3,Boots,These were a Christmas present and they sent the wrong size. Now I have to go through the hassel of returning them.
2,I think that is not good,"my left shoe is not same as right shoe,the right shoe wide than left,and the left shoe tongue is not level"
4,Rugged,If you dont like scuff marks this isnt the boot for you. Heavy duty boot. Kind of like a combat boot style
4,This Shoe Runs 1 Size Big,"Foot Locker states this shoe runs 1 size big. Are they correct? Yes. I suggest you order 1 size smaller than your normal shoe size. For example, I'm 10.5, so I should order a 9.5..."
4,Good Boots,"I like these boots very much. Price was right and they fit the bill. They are waterproof, and will probably (hopefully) serve me as long as the last pair. I bought these to replace a previous pair I bought many years ago. They tend to the large, however. You may be fine with a half size smaller than you think."
1,Timberland Men's 6 in. Basic Boots - Black Black Nubuck Suck,Length:: 0:32 MinsWaste of money. Putting on boot for the 30th time & it rips by ankle cushion. Do not waste your money on these boots. Check out my video.
5,Great,"Very comfortable boots. I wear them for dates, travels... And they are very warm..so they are good for the snow...the price was good so im really happy about them"
4,Nice Boot,The boots I received do not look like the ones in the description. There is no padding around the ankle. They are nice boots though.
4,"Timberland Men's 72066 6"" Premium Boot,Rust Nubuck,8.5 W US","Got these boots, and WOW! They appeared to be well made. Note: Boots are not made in the USA as I thought, but rather, made in the Dominican Republic. Boots are very comfortable, but I got a Wide fit, and maybe could have gone with a regular width. I normally wear EE or W width shoes, so note to users, these boots tend to fit on the wider side. Maybe wearing thicker socks will fill in the shoe better. However, the opening of the boot is rather narrow, and putting them on is a bit of a struggle, as the ankle part of the boot is made rather narrow. I've had Timberline's before and these are not as nice as the originals (back in the early 90's). 4 out of 5 as that's the only knock against these boots. Otherwise, sole is top notch quality, and the uppers are top quality new buck ."
2,10 Minutes a Day to Reading Success for First Graders,This book was not very helpful. It doesn't really target specific skills to the level I was looking for. It seems to focus more on activities than on actual learning drills.
1,So bad...it's good!,"'Pavilion of Women' is an unintentionally hilarious film. The movie is set in China, all the dialogue is in English - stilted English at that (including Willem Dafoe's as a matter of fact) - though it is meant to be in Chinese.The characters are incredibly broadly drawn - husband's a sex-addicted lying cheat, wife's a saint, son's a rebel, etc. Watching this film, we turned to each halfway through and wondered ""Why haven't we turned this off yet?"" The answer: the movie was so bad that watching it had become fun - just *how bad* could it get?Well, when the son and his girlfriend come over the hill wearing their new Communist attire...Aahhh! We knew the filmmakers had attained camp nirvana. You can't invent a moment that goofy. Simply wonderfully bad moviemaking! Excellent!!"
3,Distorted,"This would have been an excellent movie for anyone who hadn't read the book but, Mr. Wu's character was completely distorted. He was a kind, gentle man who went along with all of his wife's suggestions even though he wasn't really willing to take a concubine. The rest of the movie followed the book very well but a lot was missing. The charaacter of Father Andrew was fairly accurate up to a point. I would reoment the book to everyone. I really enjoyed it."
2,A period picture that looks like it was made in the fifties,"Don't buy this because you like Willem Dafoe, or because you loved Crouching Tiger. I couldn't believe how blatantly they exploited Dafoe's famous scene from Platoon, or how cartoon-exaggerated the characters were. The acting is inexcusably awful. It all sounded like a parody of a dubbed Asian film. Believe me, I've enjoyed some great Chinese movies, but this tries so hard to be Hollywood... it's 50's Hollywood, especially the music which telegraphs emotions like the pianist at a silent flick."
5,Love it!,"All of the Little People flap books are good. My kids love them and they are great for taking with you on a plane ride. We bought them, hid them, wrapped them and then gave them to the kids on the plane. It occupied them for a couple of hours because there are so many flaps.Highly recommend."
3,2 year old loves it,"My 2 year old absolutely loves this book, but I must say it is one of the most exhausting books we have. There are too many flaps and the content is too much for a 2 year old to take in. We have been breaking it up when we read to her. One night we talk about the colors, the next shapes. Finding the driver that goes with the vehicle is too difficult for her right now, but not too far away from that stage. Good book."
3,Not my daugher's favorite,"I bought this book at the same time I bought ""Worlds of Adventure"" and ""Let's Go to the Zoo!"" I really thought my 21 month old daughter would love this one best since it has flaps; however, she gravites more towards the others. Plus, there are less images on each page. Obviously, this can vary by child but I would recommend ""Worlds of Adventure"" or ""Let's Go to the Zoo!"" over this one."
3,Densely animated content,"My son is 19 months and isn't attracted to this book yet though I expect as he gets older that might change. For now, I believe there might be too much stimulation in the book for any one thing to stand out and interest him. Each of the interior pages is really packed full of images. I imagine it is more appropriate for a child with a greater capacity to concentrate (focus, stare, take the time to explore). My son isn't there yet, but we'll hold on to the book for when he's older."
5,I loved this movie!,"I watched this movie from NetFlix, then immediately bought it from Amazon. A wonderful feel-good movie."
5,Great film!,"Very empowering movie - one that will hold the interest of everyone.Comfortable or tension filled, the interaction between various ""damaged"" charactors is marvelous and so believable!Even the water played it's part beautifully.David Strathairn brings to life a genuine ""down home"" gentleman in his easy portrayl of the swamp wise Cajun(coon ass)/handiman! He is the unsung hero in this film!Absence of vulgarity is very commenable! Thank you John Sayles!Remarkable music deserves much better soundtrack quality."
5,A Little-Known Gem,"John Sayles' ""Passion Fish"" is one of those films whose name we pass along to our friends with good taste who are looking for intelligent entertainment. Everything in this film is top-notch, especially the performances of Mary McDonell and Alfre Woodard, but David Straithairn is the icing on the cake. Combined with the excellent uspporting cast is the Lousiana Bayou location. This is John Sayles at his best, great characters, acerbic dialogue and a feel so realistic that it makes you want to start slapping mosquitoes."
3,mispellings,"I've read 25 of Ms Howell's books and this one is a good story if predictable.Most of her books are very exciting and I always look forward to them. But,I'm so tired of seeing misspelled words. It's very distracting! Surely the editing could be improved!"
3,Loses Charge Faster than Expected,"I use these in my Garmin GPS60CXs and they wear faster than others. However, when I look under description, it does not say that they are recommended for my model. I bought these last year and the description was different."
4,A little long but ultimately fascinating,"The concepts contained within this book have implications for all of humanity. Definitely worth a read! Not wanting to make this fascinating subject matter appear too new agey, the authors were very careful to include exhaustive historic details and to explore every possible angle. I admit that I skimmed a couple of the longer chapters, but I was absolutely absorbed by the book as a whole. The story of the crystal skulls is absorbing and enlightening---and certainly a must-read in this era of corporate gluttony and environmental disregard. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Book to read even if you're not a big reader!!!,Wow!!!! Great Book! I went to Mexico last year and visited Chichenitza and heard the stories of the crystal skulls and was entriged. This book (based on facts)takes you on an adventure of how some of the skulls were found and the effects they have on people. The history and native beliefs and also how scientifically; they are an enigma. I couldn't put this book down and I'm usually one of those people who starts to read and falls asleep in the middle of a chapter.... Not this book!!! It's great!! I highly recommend!!*Have we entered a time of quickening and separation??*Is 2012 the end or a beginning?
4,Interesting Read,"I learned a lot about quartz crystal itself, and the wonderful and unique properties it has. I didn't know that the 13 skulls could all be of different types and makes. The part with the psychic that reads messages that ""resonate"" from the crystal was particularly interesting and I may buy the book that is all ""prophecies"" from the skull. The concepts in this book are unique and refreshing and it makes an interesting change of pace from books that are very ""ordinary."""
5,The Myster of the Crystal Skulls,"This is a very interesting book. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it. It kept my attention & I was always wanteing to read more. This is a true story & you can learn alot from it. Fantastic read!! I liked it so well, I bought a copy for my son-in-law."
3,Okay,I'm having a hard time finishing the book. While I think the idea is brilliant and well worth learning about... the book itself is wordy and repetitive and comes across cheesy. Could be condensed into a little pamphlet or something.
5,Love this CD,I am a Fatboy Slim fan and found this CD doing some music searching. It's a great CD and any Fatboy Slim fan will love it.
4,Cerebrally international,"This is a compilation of tunes you haven't heard anywhere in the U.S. or Burundi. It is a blend of unique and unusual. It would appeal to those who have traveled into the underequipped worlds of Rwanda, Zaire, or Swaziland. Some call it hip house; I prefer anarchist slanted rhythm and stories. The growing old ballad strikes into the heart of any world traveler."
3,nice charm but very small,Before I ordered this charm. I should have got my measuring tape out. The charm is nice but it is very small. I planned to wear it on a chain. You can barely see it on a chain. I would like it a lot more if it were bigger or if I had a charm bracelet. Maybe now I need to get a charm braclet.
5,Great tool for Skinning Deer,I have used the Buck Skinner for over 25 years. I've only used a steel rod to sharpen it. If one is careful in not chopping on bone the blade will hold it edge very well. Since I only hunt whitetail deer which is a thin skin animal other larger mammal skinning may require sharpening the blade which is not hard to do. The handle sometimes becomes slick but if kept dry is not a problem.Great knife for the job it is intended.
5,Exactly what pitching is meant to be,"This book gives exactly what is needed to pitchers who have not explored their craft to the fullest. This book gives you, the pitcher, the opportunity to not only get better, but to become a professional at the game you love."
5,good book for young pitcher,"bought this book for my son who is a 10 yr old pitcher. It has many good insights on the game that is very helpful for developing a plan of approach.The vocabulary may be a bit advanced for younger pitchers, age 10, but the main points can be deciphered through context or with the help of a dictionary. We discuss each chapter and how to apply the concepts from the book during live situations. Mental training is as important as practice on the field."
1,Confusing,"Just trying to make up a catchy paragraph for each letter of the alphabet does not amount to much. You may get a few throw away one liners from this book, but confusion is assured."
2,What was I thinking?,"I bought this DVD not knowing the quality or content. I was hoping for a National Geographic quality film all about cats. You know, a really cool documentary for the family, engaging and entertaining. Alas, I was almost immediately put to sleep by the video which was mostly this narrator talking about cats. The picture quality wasn't that great either.There were some cats in the video but, really, I could buy a book and be more entertained and informed. Please reconsider when deciding to purchase this video."
1,Boring,"I was hoping for more of a documentary style. Mr. Tabor knows his cats, but not how to present his information in an interesting manner. Very disappointed in this purchase."
2,The World of Cats - Informative but very boring presentations!,"Our son loves cats so I bought this set of DVDs and we watched it together. Roger Tabor might be an expert on cats but he sure bored the world out of us. We expected to see cats during his narration but we only saw Mr. Tabor walking, sitting, talking in front the camera... finally we saw a few seconds of a cute cat, then we found ourselves looking at Mr. Tabor again! His monotone literally put our son to sleep. After our son went to bed I thought I could watch a bit more but I too lost interest within 10 minutes. To add insult to injury, the picture quality of the movies is subpar.This is not a bad DVD set. But you will have to be a die-hard cat lover to endure all four episodes."
2,Misleading Title,"This video has nothing to do with the history of the chicken. Rather it is a collection of stories from chicken enthusiasts regarding their experiences. The narrative has poor structure, and half way through, you are left wondering just what are you planning to learn from this.Again, no actual history. Don't waste your time."
5,An Unexpected Treat,"I had no idea what to expect from the Natural History of the Chicken. What I found was an incredibly rich and complex treatment of what many would consider mundane. This tapestry of vignettes takes one on a roller coaster ride of emotions from awe to wonder, to disgust, to mirth, despair, and admiration. This is a film I am happy to have watched, one I'll want to view again and share. The last segment is particulary moving and riveting, a story that leaves one touched and reflective. I highly recommend The Natural History of the Chicken."
5,"Liza, oh sweet little Liza","Yes, The Natural History of the Chicken caught my eye while channel surfing. I came to a dead stop because of the title. Shortly the story of Liza began and within a few min I had tears in my eyes and totally understand the meaning of the title. I fell in love with Liza and her heart as well as her owner. I would have done the same things her owner did to give her the opportunity to live a complete life. What a feel good, stop and think program. Called.... The Natural History of the Chicken. Love you Little Liza, dp"
3,NOT a natural history film... but has some interesting aspects,"This film is NOT a natural history film. Instead, it explores the relationship between humans and chickens.Segments include: a neighborhood which is devastated when a cockfighting enthusiast moves in 100 roosters; a family which raises chickens for meat and eggs; a woman with a pet ""house chicken"" (a Silkie); and a farmer who has compassion for a broody hen (who turns out to be a hero).Although this film tends to mock people who love chickens, it does have balance. The final segment is extremely touching, may leave you in tears (the good kind of tears)."
1,Total ignorance by one of the interviewees......,"""I am a quite a student of eatern philosophy and one of the books I read was 'the art of war' by suntzu, a Japanese warlord"". Woooooow...this dude must be such a student of eastern philosophy and don't even want to bother googling around. ahhhhh......and camera was like picturing this dude to be a ""smart"" and ""knowledgeable"" man, which makes me somewhat infuriated."
2,Natural History of the Chicken,"First time I found a PBS program disappointing. The title misled me to expect a history of the development or evolution of the species. No such thing, it was largely anecdotal stuff about one guy's problem with noise-complaints from neighbors or a lady's love for her one chicken, etc. Not even very entertaining, rather amateurish. A waste of money for me."
2,NATURAL HISTORY?????,"The title ""Natural History"" is completely misleading! it implies the HISTORY/BACKGROUND and that is why I purchased it. I am a vegetarian, I was looking forward to honestly learning about the chicken and its' history. They are actually very intelligent animals.The contents are about people and their relationships with chickens: as pets, as raised for food and slaughtering, the chicken and egg industries; that is the focus of this. One story in it is horrific, it describes one person slaughtering a handful of chickens for food, one chicken with the head cut off lives and became a side-show attraction, living for months like this, disgusting to see and watch. IT IS NOT AT ALL ""HISTORY"" in terms of the origin of chickens, the breeds (which would be the INTERESTING COMMON SENSE PART). It should have been titled, All about the Chicken and our relationships with it. Ugh!."
1,Terrible--Not a natural history documentary,"This was just random anecdotes from around the country (many of them rather grotesque) about chickens. There were a few happy chicken stories but for the most part this was neither a natural history of chickens or even a watchable montage of chicken stories, which is what it attempts to be. Please don't waste your time watching this. I watch all sorts of documentaries and nature shows and this is the worst of anything even bordering that genre that I've ever seen."
4,Let Me Explain,Only saw a portion of this on PBS and was very delighted. I sent it to my friends who actually have chickens and never got to see the whole thing but was very moved by the headless chicken and the fluffy one that saved her babies from the hawk.
2,The title is a lie.,"I ordered this expecting that a PBS documentary entitled, ""The Natural History of The Chicken"", would be about, well, the natural history of the chicken. Like how they originated in Indonesia and then tracking their domestication, breeding, and etc. Nope. This was a cute little video with little vignettes about cute little chicken stories. ""Chicken Run"" was equally as informative as this was.Maybe as a collection of cute chicken stories, this is a great video. As a poseur of a documentary, it stinks."
2,not a history at all,"this is not a history at all. i skipped forward several times. its basically about a few ppl that own chickens and roosters. theres a zoning dispute about a guy raising 100 roosters and the noise bothers his neighbors. theres a crazy chicken lady that diapers and bathes her chicken. the only good part is at the end. this guy tells a story about his little chicken protecting her babies from a hawk. if you buy this, skip all the way to the end and watch that. i wont watch this again."
3,Not a natural history,"I wouldn't call this flick a natural history of chickens. Rather, it is a few stories about some eccentric people and their pet chickens. I found that a little disappointing, as I really did want a natural history. If you want information about where chickens originated, their history of domestication, social habits, dietary needs, and so forth...you won't find much of it in this movie. You will, however, encounter stories about people who love their birds enough to put them in diapers and keep them in the house, give them mouth to beak resuscitation, and so forth."
5,Great video!!!,This is a great video! Informative and very funny! I have watched it 4 times now and look forward to watching it again!
1,Misleading Title,"My wife and I are bird and chicken fans, having a small hobby farm with a couple of dozen interesting standard and bantam chickens. And being curious about their ancestory, we ordered the video about the Natural History of Chickens.As it turns out, the video has nothing to do with the Natural History of Chickens. Don't waste any money on this film if you are really interested in chickens. It's really about a half dozen people and their over-dramatized personal relationships with chickens. Not much redeeming content in this ""documentary."" I'd give it zero stars if I could."
2,"Should've been called ""Weirdos with Chickens""","This isn't a documentary on the ""Natural History of the Chicken"" anymore than ""Trekkies"" is a serious anthropological study of fan(atic) behavior. It's mostly just a bunch of people telling anecdotes about their experiences with chickens. Moreover, the way in which the filmmakers present a lot of these folks makes them come across as weirdos and fools, often unfairly (but sometimes not). The film has an uncomfortable, mocking, ""exploitation"" feel. For PBS, that's surprising. And disappointing."
1,Natural History of the Chicken,"I have pet chickens and have had for years. I love chickens. I hate this stupid video. Some of it is cute and entertaining, but it isn't what I thought it would be. I was looking forward to learning something about chickens, where they come from, their history, different kinds of chickens, and so on. This video shows on the one hand chicken factories, and on the other hand a bunch of crackpots who have pet chickens. Makes me wonder what the point of the video is. ... Don't waste your money."
3,Should be called Chicken People and thier Chickens,I was expecting more documented facts and real history. Don't get me wrong it was cute but it focused on a few people that had experiences with their chickens. Some realistic some not. If you want some people and their animals entertainment this is sure to fit the bill. If you are wanting more in depth information on the history and development of the chicken I might recommend 'The Chicken Book' by Paige Smith
1,Save your time and skip this,This was a waste. It was not about 'the natural history of the chicken'...nothing in this video was close to that. it was about 'weirdos who happen to have something to do with chickens'. waste.
5,I will never look at a chicken the same way again!,"I cannot wait to own this video. I watched this the other night and was so emotionally moved. This video was excellent. It is full of these great vignettes--some of which are unbelievable--and other crazy people who are ga-ga over chickens. There is one particular vignette that made me ball my eyes out in sadness one second and then ball my eyes out in joy the next. I am so impressed with this documentary, I am going to purchase this director's other video, ""Cane Toads: An Unnatural History."""
3,Not the Natural History.,"I've been duped! This video isn't about the natural history of the chicken. It is a collection of anecdotal stories about humans interacting with chickens. Some of the stories are endearing and insightful, but a natural history of the chicken? No, not really. At times this DVD seems to be a half-baked attempt to discourage people from eating chicken from the grocery store and raise chickens on their own. At times it appears bent on making people look ridiculous (most of us don't need help). I had a good laugh at some of the segments, but I feel cheated overall."
2,The cleaner leaked.,"The silicone cleaner/oil? leaked over the shipment process. It's was packed fairly well and bottle seemed secure in it's own case. Looks, like I just got a faulty cap on the bottle.There's still half a bottle left lol. It soaked the cloths that come with the kit. They can't be used to wipe anything down--as least to dry.I'm not going to go through the trouble of sending back because I have more cleaner and oil laying around and I have some more patches as well.May have been a four star product if the bottle didn't leak."
2,Good product not what was described.,The item was received quickly. But was not the product shown or described. Did not have the cleaning cloth like described.
4,"Decent Starter Kit, But...","This is a decent started kit for new handgun owners. Having just completed the NRA Basic Pistol class they recommend getting a bore snake, but this is acceptable as well.This kit contains CLR which was unanimously endorsed by the NRA instructors (3 law enforement personnel amongst them) as the correct substance to clean your pistol with."
3,Large handgun cleaning kit,"A starter kit, more pads should be included, it is only useful twice and must be replenished. Good basic hardware."
4,Nice little kit,I think this is a great kit for the price. I originally ordered a cleaning kit of the berreta website. 10 days later they send me an email saying that the order has been cancelled because it was not in stock. That brought me to Amazon to order this kit and I am glad I did. It was cheaper than the other one I wanted to buy and I don't miss anything from the other one. I have not used to cleaner that comes with it because I prefer Hoppes 9 cleaner and Hoppes oil but a lot of people use the cleaner with good success. Just a personal preference for me. Everything else in the kit works great. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the rod that it comes with does feel a little cheap. I do not think it will break but I wouldn't have minded it to be a little more sturdy. Still a great product for the money. My recomendation would be to buy it.
5,Kids liked it.,"Son says, ""It was fun! They did a lot of running around, disguising and spying.""He would like to see the Lone Ranger cartoon on Amazon Prime Instant Video."
5,The Lone Ranger,"My wife and I enjoyed seeing our childhood heros',s again with the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Since he was my favorite cowboyI would have loved to have been exposed to his many adventures of the old west. What a great role model for the kids."
5,What's Not To Like?,"Only a churl would complain about a Lone Ranger movie! This episode is a winner all around. It even has a plot, with a defined beginning, middle and end:It seems that Black Hat Lyle Bettger (""Kilgore"") wants to banish the peaceable local Indian tribe from their reservation. He has discovered a lode of silver in a sacred mountain. The real Black Hat is Robert J. Wilke, Bettger's foreman (""Cassidy""). This reviewer seems to remember Wilke for hassling Montgomery Clift in ""From Here to Eternity"", getting himself stabbed by James Coburn in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and as one of the 5 bad guys in ""High Noon"". That's quite a resume.The film quality here is excellent, with fine sharp colors and nice western scenery. What's not to like indeed? Do the Ranger and Tonto let Bettger get away with his evil scheme? Of course not! The good guys win-and in a fine old-fashioned 1950s way. Previous reviewer Ojanen (from Finland, no less) urged us to ""Just Enjoy It""! Great advice!"
3,DVD quit working close to the end of movie....,"Absolutely loved watching The Lone Ranger (Special Edition) with my 8 year old son who had never seen The Lone Ranger! It was wonderful. HOWEVER, we didn't get to finish watching the movie due to a flaw in the DVD. Near the end, it started getting really chopped up (paused on its own, then stopped, then would start again, pause, stop, flitter, pause flitter stop)to where we could not even see the ending of the movie. What a HUGE disappointment. If it had not been for the flaw in the DVD, it would have gotten an excellent review. It was fun to watch up until that point. It would have been nice to have seen the ending."
2,Not as described,"The review of this product by J. Lovins is a review of something other than what was delivered. The cover art, the contents of the discs, the number of discs, were not as described. Too bad. Beware misrepresentations by seller, or possibly ""mistakes."""
5,VCI deserves a pat on the back!,"Without any knowledge of what this DVD 2 pack contained, I bought it based on my love of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger! I was completely surprised by the quality of the film print! This film looks better than many of the feature films today. It is prestine. The trailers, interviews with Dawn Moore and Michael Ansara and photo gallery were the iceing on the cake. This was Clayton Moore's favorite LONE RANGER feature film and rightfully so. This film should have been re-released to the theaters instead of making the forgetable film of the late 1970's and Moore never should have been in a legal battle over the mask he, and only he, deserved to wear. Rick Goldschmidt (Author of THE MAKING OF A RANKIN/BASS HOLIDAY CLASSIC: RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER)"
5,Great Copy,"VCi's offering of the 1956 Lone Ranger feature film is outsatnding. Prior to this, I had to watch my old VHS EP Mode version and it was not pleasant. It never is with EP mode products. The VCi copy is clear and crisp with brilliant and vibrant colors, the way a DVD rendition of classic film should be. Despite the Region 1 tag, it is an all regions DVD and all Lone Rnager fans around the world will have the chance to enjoy this one. This is the best Lone Ranger film of all times as the production values are top notch. The sequel - The Lost City of Gold pales in comparison as somewhat akin to a made for TV movie. That must also be had to complete the cinema presenations of the Lone Ranger. The 1980's feature ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is an aberration, nice to see but not to collect. Congratulations to VCi."
4,The Lone Ranger (1956) (widescreen),"This film is the first featurelength movie featuring the stalwart stars of the TV series, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. It is the Lone Ranger in his best ever screen performance. The movie is thoroughly watchable entertainment especially in the widescreen format with some gorgeous panoramic cinematography from Edwin Dupar. The story is straightforward but with tight competent direction from Stuart Heisler the film has the look and feel of a big screen movie. Some of the stunts are spectacular to watch and the finale battle between the Lone Ranger (Moore) and the villain, Cassidy (Michael Ansara) is excellent. This a must for western fans who want to see the Lone Ranger at his best."
3,Return to Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear,"Released in glorious Warnercolor, this big-screen version of the classic TV series holds up remarkably well. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels remain the definitive Lone Ranger and Tonto - supported by handsome production values and director Stuart Heisler's brisk pacing. It's memorable entertainment for all ages. VCI offers the best DVD edition among the numerous public-domain offerings."
4,An Excellent Basic Resource,"If you are looking for basic information and colorful pictures of many of the women's military uniforms during WWII, this book fits the bill. Most of the primary women's services are covered, with the highlights of each. You will need to buy the companion to this book if you are looking for WWII Allied Nursing Services, however. An excellent resource for basic research, and children's education of women's roles during WWII. If you need more detailed info on uniforms, or history of the services, you will need to look elsewhere."
5,Gamecock License Plate,"This order was wonderful, ordered and received in just a few days. Cant wait to find more items from this site."
4,Pleasant fantasy,"When Minerva and Darryl Kiakra start experiencing unconventional visions, such as a dragon stealing cereal form Minerva's grocery cart, the two apparently ordinary mortals are on a roller coaster of self-discovery. When their three children are kidnapped by the personification of chaos and destruction, it's time to shake off the blinders and realize that they have a higher destiny than writing ad copy and grocery shopping. A cheerful effort that doesn't strain the reader. Waht serious or thought-provoking content there is deals with the loss of youthful ambition and the truly dismaying process of being a responsible adult. Fun; light reading that won't change your life but will cheer up a long evening."
4,The Two Shepherds [spoilers],"I can't improve on the ""Twist of Faith"" review (above), but an observation may not be amiss. The Chief Shepherd does not allow Jacob to die on his own schedule. Jacob, arriving home, interrupts Leila's program of suicide. Then the Chief Shepherd calls Jacob into His presence. Leila, who must now leave, has in hand the address of her sister. We understand that the Chief Shepherd has allowed ""useless"" Jacob to achieve at last the goal of years correspondence and prayer: the two sisters will be reunited.Only four stars? Well, I'm not quite comfortable with it yet. Not like ""The Diary of a Country Priest"" (superb)."
4,I bought them despite poor reviews...,"I bought a pair of DWL-500 and an SMC7004AWBR router over the weekend. I put DWL-500 on both Windows ME and XP with little difficulties. I did have fairly loaded systems so it took me a while to free an IRQ on the system running XP. After that, it was only a matter of installing drivers, PCI card, and then it's all done. Installation on ME was only a series of reboots due to the architecture of ME. Both systems perform well so far; I haven't experienced any reset or interruptions. I am pretty satisfied with"
2,Focus on the specific card not the technology,"I agree with most reviewers that wireless technology is fantastically liberating, particularly in the house when you don't want to drill holes. I also agree it's easy to set up. I've tried three different manufacturers products and they're all pretty easy to configure. However just because the technology in general is great doesn't mean this specific card is, relative to it's peers. In my house this D-Link card gets very low to non-existant signal. A computer next to it, with a Lucent Orinoco card gets full signal. I've tried moving them around and the Lucent consistently out-performs the D-Link. If you have an open plan room for your installation then no problem the D-Link works just fine, but if there are a few walls in the way, then buyer beware, not all cards are created equal."
1,Does not work with NT 4.0,I tried this product with NT 4.0 and it does not work. It claims to have conflicting interuppts when there are none.
1,No Signal,I just purchaced this product yesterday. Installation went well(both with the DWL-500 and DWl-120). I have yet to get a signal through even though i have been trying for over a day now. This might not be the best product for the novice user unless you are buying the access point with it.
4,Highly Recommended,"This is a very impressive overview of the history of the NFL. Well researched. Like all good historical books, this places the development of pro football within the larger context of events and attitudes of the times. Very informative stuff particularly with the early murky (and generally long-forgotten) history of the NFL. The league owners have always been a hard to manage alpha male group and commissioners Bell, Rozelle and Tagliabu have done an impressive of keeping the ship in order. I highly recommend this book. I would love to see this author come up with a follow-up; profiles on characters of the game, particularly in the early days to really show the flesh and bones of the players who made it all possible."
4,Prepare to be Bludgeoned,"Don't be fooled by the fact that this band is made up of former OVERCOME mebers, or that it's on a primarily hardcore label -- this is brutal, technical death metal. It's obvious that these guys have been listening to their CANNIBAL CORPSE and SUFFOCATION albums, as influence from both of those bands can be heard on this disc. There's also just a hint of that high-tech, ultra-brutal deathgrind sound that bands like ORIGIN and CATTLE DECAPITATION provide in abundance. The riffs are killer, and the drumming and vocals are more than solid. The songwriting is also solid, but this is the primary area where I feel that the band has room to improve. Also worth noting are the intelligent, sincere, spiritually-motivated lyrics, which are (for me, anyway) a welcome change from the typical gore/death lyrics. All in all, this is a high-caliber death metal release, recommended to fans of any of the bands mentioned above."
2,OK,"I don't especially like anyone's voice on this CD, except Fantine and Marius(Michael Ball). The International Cast was much better. Colm Wilkinson (Valjean) sounds half dead through the whole thing. Javert is nothing like the IC one."
3,WHAT A MUSICAL SHOULD BE,"As the cry of ""do you hear the people sing"" from the company of Les Miserables disapears into the speakers of your cd player it then hits you that you have just listend to a masterpiece.The earth shattering chours numbers and the heart renching solos is musical theatre at it's finest.From the insperational ""One Day More"" to the emotionally provoking ""Bring him home"" it is a true jem of a show.However I have given the recording a 3 star rating for one reason.It fails to tell the story enough so that people actuaally can follow the story. For people who have not seen the musical I truly believe they would not be aware of what is going on. Les Mis is indeed a lavish score which all of would certinally not fit onto one recording however as in the 10th Anniversary recording it can be done in away that people are able to follw. No matter what this enchanting musical will always impress the most sceptical of musical lovers however I have heard better recordings then this one."
2,Not the best recording!!,This is not the CD of Les Miz that you will adore. Get the 10th Anniversary Concert. Its a worth-to-have CD...
2,Worst recording to date,Slow... slow... slow... nasal...nasal... nasal...Get the the complete symphonic version and the anniversary concert recording: THEY're the ones worth your money!
4,Great!,"To get the best deal, however, get the Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert version. That recording has the best performers (""the dream cast"")."
4,Okay.,"This is the first major recording, so this is an excellent copy to have for reference/historical purposes. The performances are good (especialy Colm Wilkinson and Michael Ball's).If you want the best version, however, get 10th Annversary Concert Recording. TAC's Eponine alone, the brilliant Lea Salonga, is enough reason to get it. She acts better (her interpretation is more heartfelt and definitely more in tune to her character's experiences) and her very pure, powerful, and lovely voice is a hundred times better than Frances Ruffelle's annoyingly scratchy voice. The TAC recording, as many reviewers have noted, also has a much livelier atmosphere -- and even has a special number in the end with Valjeans from different productions around the world performing. So get the TAC (and don't forget the essential Complete Symphonic Recording) instead of this or the Original Broadway Cast recording, if you can't afford to buy them all."
3,Good but not great,"The main problem with this CD is that it's very incomplete. Other problems that plague it, Patti Lupone's fantine isn't very sympathy worthy, she's too brash and loud (nothing like the excellent Ruthie) The pace of this version is also rather slow becuse the show hadn't been refined yetNow or the good, some of the synthetic music sounds really awsome on this CD. Michael Ball and Colm Wilkenson are great as always and Francis Ruffelle's Eponine is so sweet, it'll break your heart when she sings On my own and A little Fall of Rain"
5,One Of The Best !,"Simply put, Les Miserables is one of the greatest musicals ever written for the stage. Both the London and Broadway versions of this classic best each other in terms of superiority, but you can't really go wrong with either.The marvelous London cast includes Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, Roger Allam as Javert, Patti LuPone as Fantine, Michael Ball as Marius, and Frances Ruffelle as Eponine.Best Songs include:At The End Of The DayI Dreamed A DreamCome To MeMaster Of The HouseStarsOn My OwnA Little Fall Of RainBring Him HomeEmpty Chairs At Empty TablesIf I had to choose between the two, I'd lean towards the Broadway version ... though it's hard to pass up anything Ms. LuPone does."
5,Les Miserables,Saw Les Miserables over 20 years ago in L.A. and wasn't crazy about it. Someone told me to listen to the music again and I did and couldn't stop listening to it. It is so powerful. Can't wait to see the movie. Love the CD.
5,The version to buy,"Excellent rendition of a great musical. There are many versions, but this seems to be the best. It is missing a few songs that are present in the Complete Symphonic Recording, but with nearly two hours of music and all the important songs, it will satisfy all but the most fanatic fan!"
4,You want all of them.,"I purchased the London version after my Broadway version broke. From the reviews I felt I would be impressed with this version and sadly I almost can't stand to listen to it. This may only be due to my 15+ years of only listening to the Broadway version. London recording is entirely too slow. ""Master of the House"" is extremely slow with no build to the ending. The ending on ""One Day More"" leaves you hanging and wondering if they forgot the end of the song. If you have never heard either then you will be safe buying any edition, they all have amazing voices."
5,Les Miserables,"I love this version of the stage play. The London cast is the best, in my opinion. The play will come to Columbus, Ohio, next year, and I will go again. I've seen it once and have seen excerpts on PBS. This is a wonderful CD."
3,disappointing,"Wow, some people are very detailed with their reviews. I will just give my overall impression. I thought the music was slower, and thus less emotional. The voices, although good, dont hold the same intensity as the broadway performances (actually Jean Valjean was really great, and Javeir may be better here). I thought Marius didnt have the soft quality of voice that I so loved in the broadway version. Enroljas was also not fiery enough. Honestly, I never do this, but I am planning to throw it out because it just doesnt give me the shear enjoyment that the broadway version does- I just end up nitpicking its faults, and I already have the couple of extra songs from this version to keep, so no loss there!"
5,Totally awesome!,"I don't care what some of you more critical broadway fans say- the original is the best! There will always be the next Lea Salonga who is ready to just step in and usurp a long held part from a fading star, but the original stars never die. Les Miserables is forever, and nothing can erase the impression it made upon the world in it's original form."
3,"Good, but...",save yourself some money. Go get the Complete Symphonic Recording and the 10th Anniversary Concert DVD (which has the BEST cast) and you've got all the Les Miz you'll ever need!
2,The MP3 download doesnt work,It wouldnt download properly to my MP3. The songs on the two discs got jumbled and out of order. I was unable to fix it.
4,"Not a full recording, not a highlights either - intermediate length.","You get the feel of the 80s musical that it is - a lot of synthesizers being used. It is an interesting copy that can't be missed, but not the best recording out there - a lot of parts are missing and some characters lack depth that they would get in later versions (most probably because the first Les Miz in English was put together in a hurry)."
2,Didn't like it,One of my kids went off to college with my recording and I mistakenly bought this version as a replacment. What a disappointment. I thought the performances were flat and thoroughly uninspiring. I'll try another! Wish I could return this one.
5,London cast is my favorite,The Original London cast version of Les Miserables is the best. I highly recommend this CD for all of you that truly enjoy this great musical.
3,"Disappointing, indeed, for Eponine fans.",Whiny and squeaky interpretation here leaves much to be desired. Get the 10th Anniversary Concert Recording -- you'll find an Eponine version that's heartfelt and empathetic.
4,Great for what they had to work with,"After the anniversary edition, the begins to pale, but I love it nonetheless. Everyone should listen to it, and preferable listen to it first, before all the other versions. Learn to love the original, and go from there."
5,Les Miserables Original London Cast,"Beautiful Music, Beautiful Voices. I have thouroughly enjoyed it. We saw the show when it came to Atlanta several years ago and it also was wonderful.NKG"
4,Love the soundtrack,This CD came in quickly and was well packaged. The CD was still in original cellophane and was not damaged or scratched.
5,NOTHING IS BETTER HEN THE FIRST,YOU CAN TRY TO REPEAT BUT IT NEVER QUIT THE SAME. ARE GOING TO BE MORE RECODINGS FROM thy never meet epectasions
2,TAC is far more better,"I used to adore Francese Ruffelle with her rendition of ""On my Own"" but not anymore when Lea came into the limelight. I believe that if Lea was around the time when Les Miserables created they for sure will have Lea as Eponine in my opinion. Now with the TAC version I can only rate the original version 2 stars while the Starstudded TAC gets my 5 stars."
3,Weak Les Miserable,"Let me start by saying that Les Miserables is one of my favorite shows, and I am soooo disappointed that I must write this review. I own the 1987 Broadway recording and have reviewed it (some time ago) and gave it 5 stars. I purchased this recording hoping for something of the same caliber and received a weak premature work that would not properly sell the show. The orchestrations are generally miniscule and tiny, not full-bodied and beautiful like the Broadway recording. Some of the voices are similar on both recordings but the biggest disappointment was Javert! SO not worth listening to. Hands down you should get the 1987 Broadway recording and NOT this one. No one. I won't even add a favorite song because its only my favorite because I can hear the Broadway version."
3,Get the TAC and CSR versions instead!,"No other recordings beat the 10th Anniversary Concert and the Complete Symphonic recordings -- they have the BEST cast and orchestration.Unfortunately, non-singer Frances Ruffelle, whose whiney and squeaky performance in this recording crosses over to the Broadway recording, is enough reason NOT to get either this or the Broadway recording. (Eponine is a desperate, bitter character, NOT a whiney, shrieky, and weak child! Check out the full range of emotions in Lea Salonga's power-packed performance in the concert and you'll realize how this role should be played especially on stage.)Don't waste your money on this album."
5,original better than the movie soundtrack,"I purchased both the movie soundtrack and this. This one is far superior. In listening to the original London production, you can get a sense of the whole play, whereas the movie soundtrack doesn't paint the picture as well.If you've seen the movie, and loved it, do yourself a favor and buy this version of the music."
2,"Voices great, Orchestration terrible","While the singing talent is fantastic, the orchestration all sounds electronically synthesized. After having heard Highlights of the UK (London) cast on a different recording and having loved it, I was severly disappointed by the lack of richness in the music. Night and Day. I don't understand how some of the other, seemingly proficient, reviewers could not have picked this out.It says right on the back cover of the CD case: ""Synthesizers programmed by John Cameron"".Electronic synthesis cannot do justice to the majesty of this material.I'll be selling this, and looking for another version.BTW, if you haven't seen the 2010 25th anniversary DVD version, it's worth watching. Great talent, great singing, huge orchestra, with a nice treat at the end."
4,"This one's good, but...","as the other reviewers have said, the anniversary recording has the most exciting atmosphere and the best cast. And yes, if Lea Salonga had been old enough to audition for the role back then, we wouldn't be hearing Frances Ruffele shrieking her way through her Eponine songs in this (and the 1987) album.But this is still a must-buy. And if you're a real Les Miserables fan, you should have all major recordings."
3,Disappointing!,"My first exposure to Les Mis the musical was through the Complete Symphonic Recording. Then I attended the 10th Anniversary celebration and got that recording, so upon listening to this particular album, the most I got was disappointment. The arrangement is very slow and most of the cast, while good by general standards, are mediocre compared to the talents I saw during the anniversary. Listening to Lea Salonga then to Frances Ruffelle for instance, is like going from smelling the sweet scent of a beautiful rose to getting wounded by its thorns. The difference in experience between the two recordings is so big that once you've listened to the 10th Anniversary Recording, everything else pales in comparison."
3,"I like it, but...","I love this musical! I saw it for the first time recently in London, and had to go back and see it again. However, I was a little disappointed in this soundtrack. I don't like the way it skips from song to song with none of the in-between singing. Also, the words to ""A Heart Full of Love,"" one of my favorite songs, were different. And the song ""Every Day"" was left out. Guess I'll order the ""complete symphonic score,"" although I thought that was what this was! Oh well."
4,"Excuses, excuses...","With her squeaky voice and her whiny portrayal of Eponine, Frances Ruffelle's version pales in comparison to Lea Salonga's. Lea Salonga not only acted the role well (so much appropriate emotion), she sang it really well (someone hit all the notes perfectly, for a change!)Frances fans are now resorting to ciritcizing Ms. Salonga by giving these excuses that her interpretation does not match the character in the book (although her version isn't any different from Frances', except for their acting and singing abilities) and implying that Eponine's character does not deserve a good performance (use an ugly voice?) because the character is so and so....Get all recorded versions and the differences in performances are crystal clear: even Kaho Shimada does better than Frances Ruffelle in the role."
3,"Pretty good, but...","This OLC recording is probably better than the OBC one, but it isn't the best I've heard. While it's interesting to compare how the musical has evolved somewhat from its beginnings to the standard version performed today, and while the OLC cast did the best job they could, I don't think this is the best recording overall. At times the music is too slow to carry the momentum essential to a musical of this length, and the singers occasionally sound horribly laboured. While emoting is a good thing, sounding as though one is dying for breath is probably not the best way to endear oneself to the listener. Plus, as a long time fan of the musical, I prefer either the complete symphonic recording (highly recommended!) or the 10th anniversary recording since all of the music is there. Still, a better recording than some on the market-you could do worse than to get this recording of one of the greatest musicals of all time."
5,Les Mis is da bomb!! I looooooove it!! It deserves 6 stars!,Micheal Ball has got to be THE best singer. Nobody could sing the part of Marius better!! Everybody does great. It is sad yet happy. It is pretty sad how everyone but Cosett and Marius and Ponine's parents die. Insiring story.
3,A great rough draft...,"Every masterpiece needs a rough draft... Get the 1987 Original BROADWAY Cast recording. Valjean stays the same, and the rest of the cast is replaced with better singers, such as the ones who play Fantine, Javert, and Eponine. Valjean's parts are enhanced to provide a better overall sound, and the duet ""Confrontation"" just seems too bland, whereas in the 1987 recording, it is bursting with tension and emotion.This recording is good, but simply does no justice to the actual music."
4,Terrific!,One of the funniest books I've read in a long time. Monique is definately going to give Stephanie Plum a run for her money. Getting Personal is worth every dime.
5,20 Bit Recording,"I really don't understand what is meant by the following line on the back of this CD, ""The superior technical quality of this 20 bit master recording can be enjoyed by audiophiles who will appreciate the improved clarity and signal to noise performance it offers to music with a wide dynamic range."", all I know, is that it is beautifully done and sounds TERRIFIC! I think most people will really like this CD!"
4,Strong book,"Ok, I admit this is NOT my first book on Emily Bronte. In fact, I have both of Juliet Barker's books on the Bronte sisters. I ordered this book because she uses it as a reference, I believe, in one--maybe both--of her books. This book is well-written, very detailed. I felt it was an informative, well-documented analysis of both Bronte's work and life."
2,I Erringly Assumed This Was the Product For Me...,"The pencil is labeled as being for ""dark blondes"", but the color goes on so lightly it is indiscernible. I have dark blonde hair, I have light skin and light brows, and I erringly assumed this was the product for me. I have used it once or twice and regretted it. It makes a mess of my eyebrows and I end up having to redo them in a darker color. The applicator is not easy to use, the pencil is wholly useless, and I do not have patience for this product. I ended up buying a Brow Marker from M.A.C. for about $18 dollars, but it was light years better than this product. For those that have to pencil their eyebrows in order to see them, this brow pencil won't help you."
4,Great product,"Very easy to fill in eyebrows with this pencil, glides on smooth and very blendable, I like it a lot."
2,don't work for me,"The pencil is fine but I feel like the gel is greasy. And if you put powder on your face, some sticks to the gel which makes you look like you have snow on your eyebrows."
4,Great for Blondes,"I don't use the pencil side, only the brow gel. I actually use MAC Omega shadow for filling in my brows then I set it with this brow gel. I wish they made the gel separately. It will last you a long time too."
2,Don't Buy the Gel!,"The pencil color is useful, but the gel is horrendous. One of my friends thought I had mud on my eyebrows. Opt for a clear gel instead!"
3,Not bad,"I do like the way it applies, but rubs off easily...after 2 hours I reapplied again:( I think I'll continue using ""Wunderbrow"" it's expensive but lasts for 3 days."
2,Gel container is dry!,"Crayon is OK, nothing special, but gel is non-existing - at least in my item - so, i have no chance to try it on my eyebrows.Can i return this thing without the original package?"
3,Pencil works great; gel not so much.,"The item arrived in a timely fashion. I used a brow stencil which worked well with the pencil. After I used the gel, the brow looked as if I had a bad case of dandruff. Very flaky."
3,brows are the window dressing for the eyes,"Since losing my brows and lashes to chemo, I have tried numberous products as an eye pencil. This one was not bad, but not great either. It had to be reapplied several times through out the day to keep a ""fake brow"" in place. But I am sure that if I had eyebrow hairs it would have been a perfectly adequate product. It just didn't work for my needs."
2,"Good, but where are all the Horses?","This book was OK, but I really enjoy hearing about the horses. What happened to all the trail rides, horse shows, riding lessons, and Horse Wise meetings? Being a rider myself I care more so about the horses than about relationships. They really have nothing to do with Pine Hollow. These books are ok for the older people, but I hope you continue with the Saddle Club Books which are the BEST!!!"
1,Where have all the horses gone?,"I think Bonnie Bryant should really consider putting back all of the old characters and horses! Maybe she should take a hint from the Throughbred series, the people get older, but they never forget about there horses!"
4,"DIFFERENT, BUT NOT ALL BAD","I thought that the other books by Bonnie Bryant where much better then these Pine Hallow books. There are many things that I know are wrong and not true facts about horses when reading these books. But the problem was there where no horses in this book. Also, I thought that Emily has always been a long time member. I think that this book was too up-tight and not real. Tho whole part of Lisa in Cal. has nothing to do with anything. The Saddle Club books where different stories everytime. This is just one big long story. Make a movie, skip the book. We should read different storys everytime. Not the same story over and over with a new twist. I thought that it was a good book, but this is just the things I thought where bad."
3,do you have to buy it,Unfortunately the manufacturer only specs it's blades ( that lose their carbide tips easily) and it's an odd size
3,Nice book! Great art but images are very small.,When I first looked at the book I was excited to see the beautiful cover with color image and gold foil. Once I opened it I was very disappointed in how small the images were. A lot of very nice painting but with plenty of black around them. A good art book should just stand on it's own but with this one somebody tried to get artsy with the layouts. Art fans want to see nice big clear prints of the art and could care less about decorative graphics with 3-4 paintings per page. It's distracting. I guess it is more of a reference book than a art book. I think the editor was just confused with what kind of book they were trying to make.On a good note it is hard cover and printed on nice paper. There is also a interview with Greg at the end of the book but I'm just to disappointed to read it right now....Sorry Greg all of your other books are awesome.
2,Overwhelmed,"This book is filled with information, but Gary has made this book too sophisticated for the average lay person. This truly is for the person who has lots of time and desire to work at eating. I need to simplify my life not complicate it with specialty food items. I felt lost and overwhelmed."
3,Did anyone try out the recipes?,"I found this book intriguing and supportive of my choice to follow a vegetarian lifestyle. But I tried several of the breakfast recipes and the measurements for ingredients were way off (example: Raspberry oat-soy-banana pancakes). Did anyone try these out? Also, the appendices, which take up a third of the book, added no particular value - vegetable photo chemicals?"
2,Only half of the ultimate lifetime diet,"I bought this book expecting to receive a comprehensive 31-day plan complete with recipes. As I began to write out the recipes, it became apparent that nine of the lunch recipes were missing in the first week alone! Since the author does not respond to email at his website, I am stuck with a lot of expensive health food ingredients for breakfast and dinner, and no way of knowing what to do about lunch! It can also be very difficult to locate a lot of the ingredients, even if you can figure out what they are. I don't recommend this book for anyone serious about the specific diet plan because you will be disappointed. There are other points he makes about exercise and self-empowerment that are probably covered in many of his other books."
1,The season that runied Chef!,"The first two seasons of Chef! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch. Season three, however, is virtually unwatchable - they changed director, changed from film to video tape, replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history. I would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons."
3,somewhat disappointed in fort worth,"The first 2 seasons of chef were really amazing, and exciting, however season 3 changed so much. I really didn't like the way the show wentfrom film to video, and I also don't like the way that the characters changed so much, (we know nothing about these people). I am glad, however, that Everton remains until the end. I was disappointed to see that gareth had sold the restaurant, and was no longer the owner, but Iwas glad to see that Janice had left Gareth, because he really paid her no attention...This series was really hard for me to watch, because I hated to see Gareth's life be in the toilet the way that it was...but the last 2 episodes of season 3 were really brilliant. I was so happy to see that Janice was finally pregnant; that She and Gareth got back together."
4,Better than what has been said,"After reading some of the reviews here I was reluctant to pick up the third series of this wonderful Britcom. I'm glad I used my own judgement instead of relying on others'.First: The change from film to tape doesn't really change the feel of the series. It does look more 'sitcomy', but the atmosphere is retained.Second: The Premise. It shouldn't really surprise anyone that Gareth has been dumped by his wife, you could see that in series one. Granted, Gareth is more whiney in this series, but characters are supposed to develop over time. Gareth and Everton do just that.Although not up to the level of the first two series, series three had me laughing out loud several times and is well worth viewing."
5,Better than sliced bread!,"I have watched this so many times, I can quote it by heart. Lenny Henry makes Gordon Ramsay look like a kindergarten kid .... and Lenny is actually funny!"
5,True to life debut,"I was drawn to this book initially because not only did I live in Marin County back in the 1980's (the very time and place the novel was written and is set) but I also actually worked behind the bar at the Shakey's Pizza in Terra Linda that provides one of the main settings for this novel. So it's a good bet that author Louis B. Jones was one of my customers at some point! The great thing about this - and Jones' follow-up, ""Particles And Luck"" - is that it rings true to life. The characters are recognizable from daily life and their dreams and aspirations ring true. This novel is to Marin County, California what the films of Bill Forsyth (""Local Hero"", ""Comfort And Joy"", etc.) are to Scotland: a sweet and whimsical slice of life so real you can taste it."
2,disappointing,"I was looking for inspirational music. The first couple of songs were great and then it was downhill from there. I was hoping for a few more vocals. My friend said 'who died?'. Great talent, but it sounds like funeral music."
4,the runaway rainbow.,this was a birthday present for my 4 year old grand daughter and she likes it a lot. it is definitely for younger children.
5,Great purchase!,I am very happy with the purchase of this movie. My 5 yrs. old daughter likes My Little Pony. We usually rent them and buy if we like it. So this movie is a keeper. It's Very pretty and colorful and also has a nice music too!! She can see this again and again.
2,too weak,"There's a stronger Adagio Earl grey. This wasn't advertised with the specific type and as it turned out was the ""Bravo"" which I did not want and did not get as good of a rating as the other Adagio Earl Grey. I'll pass on this one."
5,Excellent,Hard to find in the major dept stores these days. Price was as it has been for twenty years. Shipped on time.
1,Not what I ordered,"What came to me is not the original Xeryus, but it does have the smell of it.Too bad that it doesn't last nearly as long as the original did.I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,superb,"I recently bought this CD, about a year after the song came out. I already had the American version, which only had the clean version plus the instrumental, but I was still happy UNTIL I walked in the store and saw this one for 10 bucks! I looked and saw that it had 4 songs, including a special remix of Look Into My Eyes, so I had to get it. The new version is real tight, with a dope beat and new chorus tune. This CD also inludes: Look Into My Eyes (clean), Tha Crossroads and 1st of Tha Month (edited, w/out Tre). All I can say is GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!"
5,Worked great.,"Contrary to the previous review, this sand worked great for me. I have an Intex Ultra Frame 32' by 16' with a 16"" Intex Sand Filter with the Saltwater Chlorine Generator... living in a rural area there was only one sand available locally. I purchased the ""no brand"" pool filter sand and installed it. After backwashing and rinsing the sand I quickly found out the sand was too fine as it began pumping out into the pool. I emptied the sand and ran the filter without sand until I could find a suitable sand. Intex recommends a '20 grade' sand with a particle size between .85 and .45. The Quikrete sand label does not boast a grade but a quick visit to their website revealed a particle size of .85 to .425. I decided to try this sand and found the particles to be much larger than the local ""no brand"" sand. A quick backwash and rinse and my filter was up and running perfectly. Thank you Quikrete."
1,Didnt work for my filter!!!,This sand did not work in my sand filter and all I ended up with is a mess. I thought that all pool sand was the same but obviously it isnt. It waas just a plain intex pool salt water sand filter and the sand was too fine and it just kept pumping through. Just go to your local home hardware store and they will most likely have what you need.
5,Soul Stirring,"""Don't Drive Your Mama Away,"" makes me cry everytime I hear it. As a teen, I never really cared for Gospel music, until I heard this song. I bought the album, years later, and have been playing ever since. All of her songs have a timeless message. The entire CD, can bring one back to one's roots, no matter the culture or heritage. Makes one think and brings one back to the basics; what's really important--not the web, money, monthly rent, loans, etc.... The music is uplifting, energizing, and can stir your soul to tears. It's very simplistic, easy on the ear and heart. Enjoy!"
3,A real tear jerker....but i liked it anyway,This book is a shameless tear jerker but we need those kind of books every now and then. Rice gives us a beautiful story about what happens to people when they suffer a loss. She develops her characters well and carries us through the many emotions we face when we experience love and death and love again. It is a really beautiful story and after I stopped crying I was able to finish the last few pages.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!!!!!,"This was the first book I've read by Luanne Rice and I definately will be reading more. I was so caught up in the story that it was the on my mind the whole time I was work and I couldn't wait to get back home to read more. It was a beautifully written book and anyone who wasn't moved by it has no compasion for his fellow human beings. As soon as I finished, I told my husband that he had to read it too and his opinion was the same as mine. He said it certainly cleared out his sinus (his way of saying that it brought tears to his eyes too). This book definately takes a place of honor in our library."
2,Major disappointment,"I was a big fan of Blue Moon, one of Luanne Rice's other books, so I bought this. It was awful. Very predictable characters, soap opera plot, and very light reading. I'd like to pass my copy on to someone, but I think it would be an insult. This one's a loser. Sorry, Luanne."
2,Disappointing,"Luanne Rice is one of my favorite authors, but this was not one of her best in my opinion. While the major characters were very likable and the plot emotional, I found it too simplistically written and not up to her previous books like Home Fires and Stone Angel."
3,And the point is---?,"I cannot find fault with Luanne Rice's ability to craft a moving novel, but this was not an example of her best work. Perhaps if I had not read this book following ""Little Night"", I would not be so negative. Reading two sad books in as many days is a bit much .There is just such hopelessness about this novel.As a brain tumor survivor, I understand fully what a terrible ordeal brain surgery is.I did not have cancer but for a long time afterward lived with the fear that the tumor might reoccur. Nevertheless, I have residual effects from the surgery which are life changing.I just don't see why this book had to end the way it did. I don't care for sappy,romantic novels where everything is just beautiful, that is not realistic, but it seems to me that if the story had ended on a hopeful note it would be more uplifting! As it is, after reading ""Cloud Nine"", one needs several days to recover!!!"
4,Good read!,"A pleasant book. This book is somewhat wordy, but I liked it. She should have leftout parts about the kitten."
5,A heartwarming story,Cloud Nine is a must read for romance lovers. I recently discovered Luann Rice and her books and this one did not disappoint. I felt so much a part of the characters that I rejoiced with them and cried with them. A great read indeed.
1,cloud nine,"Trapped on an airplane with this book, I had to drag out a pen and write in the margins to keep still. Words like, ""hackneyed, trite, and insipid"" kept appearing. Call me an English major, but if this is what's leading the market today we're in trouble."
4,12-kleenex ending,"I haven't read a book in a long time, probably since Love Story, that made me cry this hard at the end. I agree with one critic who said the ending was predictable, but I never gave up hope for Sarah and the ending was written so beautifully heartwrenching. It was my first Luanne Rice novel, and I'm on line to find another."
2,Luanne Rice sells out to Romance Writer,"Save your money on this one. Luanne Rice is a gifted writer of intelligent fiction, but in CLOUD NINE she gives way to a more simplistic, ""romance"" style of writing. I recommend instead that you try her earlier novels HOME FIRES and CRAZY IN LOVE. They are both worthy of your time and money."
2,What was the point?,"Do not read this review if you don't want to know the ending! I liked the characters, I liked the island in Maine, I loved the plot setup. Tell me. What was the point in the heroine dying? I am a two time cancer survivor.I was thrilled to read a story about a survivior with funky Annie Lennox-like hair, who has a second chance. I know people die, but what was the point in having the heroine die in this fictional book? She had her son back, she made peace with her father, made a difference in a young girl's life, and found true love for the first time. I'd devoted hours enjoying this book and the end still has me shaking. It's my worst nightmare of dying from cancer while still young. What was the point in killing Sarah off?"
2,Nothing wrong with the book.,I am not interested in the subject - nothing against the writer or the publisher - just not my interest.
3,Not what I expected!,"This is the first book I've read by Luanne Rice, but I will try her again. At time the book is slow, but I kept reading and was quite surprised!"
4,Good story; almost too sad,"I have read almost all of Luanne Rice's books, and this is the most heart-wrenching I've read. I loved the characters, although they are very similar to other characters in Rice's other novels. Rice includes the same conflicts with divorce, family ties, and dealing with death and dying as in some of her other novels. But it is a good story of love, friendship, communication, and family. Far better than CRAZY IN LOVE and STONE HEART. I enjoyed DANCE WITH ME, HOME FIRES, and DREAM COUNTRY about as much as this one."
1,cloud 9,"This book really depressed me. Two days after reading it I am still feeling depressed. The ending was definitely a shocker. Even though Sarah finds love with Will it is depressing that Will has to go through more tragedy in his life. I read fiction to lighten up my day, not to become depressed by it. I would not recommend this book. I will not buy anymore of this author's books."
5,Captures and pulls your heart strings,"I have just started reading Luanne Rice's books. This one at first was a little hard to get into but it took no time at all till I was caught, hook, line and sinker. All I wanted to do was read it and nothing else. I was so pulled into the life of Sarah and her dealing with cancer and loss and trying to pull what is left of her family in closer. I bawled like a baby over this. Luanne Rice has just acquired another avid fan."
5,hope for us all,"For anyone who has lost hope for the future, this is an excellent read. It makes us think of what we each have to be grateful for in this life and to live everyday to its fullest even when we think it is not worth going on. Bravo, Luanne Rice!"
1,pretty good,"Definitely a must have for reggae an Dancehall fans. A tad bit better than dutty rock, as the majority of the songs are pretty good an i cud listen to the entire song without getting bored..A Decent album overall."
1,sean,I been listening to Sean forever and this is not the sean I know. This album is truely crap. No good beats and no good rapping. Dutty Rock is way better!
5,Great cd!,"I've always loved reggae music and had heard Sean Paul's music before. I already knew I would like his cd before I purchased it; I had heard most of the songs on this cd already. If you like Sean Paul, you'll love this cd."
2,Disappointing!,"This is not a good example of Sean Paul's talent. I found it to be very repetitive and without direction. I was not pleased with this new CD. (Sorry, Sean Paul!)"
3,VERY MAD NOT EXPOSING DANCEHALL.. CMON DUTTY,"First off Dancehall is a hot genre full of unique artists in Jamaica always bumpin music. Now the trinity album has 6 or 7 good songs and pretty sure it will rock a party. Now... all I see in his album is Looga Man and Wayne Marshall which is kool but they are not the top acts in Jamaica and he used to work with them back in the day. Where's My man Bounty Killer,Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Mr Vegas, Buju Banton,Capleton, Busy Signal the list goes on. Those are your top artists in dancehall why haven't you collaborated with them.... is it because you dont want anybody else to share the spotlight with you. Im pretty sure they would collaborate with you but is this ablum to line up your pockets or for dancehall very questionable. BTW nina sky is not dancehall she is reggaeton. Like you said Sean paul bring back the love.... where is it, its not on your album."
4,Sean-a-Paul!,This CD is much better than Dutty Rock.I liked We Be Burnin' and Touch My Body most.He' so successful on his job.
2,A Big Disappointment....Where's the new songs?,"As a hardcore dancehall fan, I keep up with all the new riddim selections that come out every week. I was looking forward to this new album for awhile hoping for a battery of new songs. After all, Sean Paul is probably the most commercialized dancehall artist. To my surprise"
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Sean Paul does it...that's right, repeats the same song over and over 18 times and does even do a good job of it."
4,for real and down to earth,"A lot of his songs are based on real life. OF course some of them are dance songs like ""give it up to me"", ""temperature"", I enjoy it very much. I wasn't so sure at first but then it really grew on me. Something I like listening in my car while I Drive. Sean Paul's little hard to understand though, at least for me. I never could really understand what he's singing but I certainly love it anyway. Some have more of a hip hop, some a reggae, and a lot he just fused together. I'm quite pleased the the album and reccommend it to anyone who likes hip hop with a reggae twist"
4,We Be Burnin....Not Concernin!,"I don't really know how to review a reggae album, even though I like me some reggae, the accents and uptempo nature of albums like this one make it hard for me to know what they are saying. Consequently, I only take in about 25% of what Sean Paul is saying on this album (even though he is one of the easier artists to understand). The beats are mostly uptempo dance tracks that bang even though I can't do those moves they do in the videos! Just that one move that Sean Paul does.This is a fun album, definitely throw it on if you having a party that's about dancing. He also has some slower songs on here that are just as good as the uptempo songs. My favorite songs are Temperature, We Be Burning, Give it Up To Me, Connection, All On Me, Head To Toe, and Ever Blazin. The album is bumpin, although a little long, nonetheless hot. If you don't have this already then go out and get it."
3,The Trinity has something good.,"Sean Paul's Album the trinity is much better than that disastrous daddy yankee album Barrio Finno, his songs are smooth and more luxurious and beautiful, although it has it's certain flaws, still it's entertaining, so I Voted thumbs up, it was never boring, always nice and it's album ideas, even the lyrics absolutely fell to pieces."
4,Gimme your bodyyyyyyyyy,"Don't misinterpret Sean Paul's objective here - his music is meant for clubs and dance parties. You cannot seriously critique this CD as if it was made to be a work of genius - because it's not. But what you can do is realize that in this genre of music, whether it's reggae - reggaeton - or dance, this CD is hot. Don't listen to what everyone else is saying, Trinity has 6 hot tracks:Ever BlazingGive It Up To MeAll on MeConnectionWe'll Be BurningTemperatureTemperature is better than any track on Sean Paul's first CD. Buy this one if you're going to use it at a party or something -it has great dance beats."
2,I'm sorry but here's a REAL review.,"No. This is NOT the same Sean Paul that brought us Gimme the Light and my favorite Sean Paul song EVER Get Busy. I think the old guy ran away never to return again. Besides a few OKAY tracks like the hit singles (which one of them I can't stand) this CD is very repetitive leaving an uninspired taste in your mouth. Can you dance to this? Yeah. Maybe. IF YOU'RE DEAF. I'm telling you to stay away from this one and buy Durty Rock. Getting a new CD just to get a new CD is overrated anyway.Worst songs: I'll Take You ThereBreakoutBest songs: We Be Burnin' and Temperature, sadly.CDs worth: Just over a buck!(Just have someone burn it--at least you won't have to be disappointed after spending 15 bucks on...this.)"
4,Respect Due,"Even though he's no Rude Bwoy, Sean Paul has expanded the notion of dancehall (at least in the US) more than any single artist since Shabba brought it to Carribean Riddims (BET) back in the day. Without question b/c of Sean Paul future dancehall artists have the opportunity for more visibility and more money. Point Blank."
4,"Good Follow - Up, But No Dutty Rock","This album was pretty good and will put you on your feet, but Dutty Rock is the better of the two. Sean Paul fans won't be disappointed but its not a commericalized as Dutty Rock."
1,"Rubbish, pure rubbish","Please people, do not waste your time with this. Save your money and buy their albums, I would rather listen to Roger Waters toot Pigs On The Wing,in fact I would rather listen to a horse take a leak on the productions heads because they should have had the mentality to let Pink Floyd tell the story, and no one else. I mean, MAN, how bad does it have to get to sell your souls to the devils to produce such crap. ( I mean literally, CRAP!!!!) Such rubbish, and I have both sets too. WHOOPS! Seriously save your bread."
1,Way to small,"Way to small for the price, very disappointing it smells good but they package it in a huge envelope, u get excited and it's teeny tiny. If your gunna get one get one that's bigger somewhere else, not worth it"
4,Small but love the smell,"I paid a little more than I wanted for the amount of perfume I got. But I couldnt find this at the original retailer I purchased it from. Love the smell.. So, all in all I guess Im getting what I paid for."
1,disappointed because of misrepresentation,The bottle of perfume you sent is square and sits on a table. You advertised the tall rectangle size that can go in your purse - which is what I thought I was buying.Why did you do that?
2,They were ok for a bit....,"I had these installed in my 2001 Honda Civic LX and they seemed to be great. The handling was great but after hitting around 60mph the steering wheel begins to shake. Then, after 5 months of having these bushings installed, the cold weather came and wow...what a difference...not a good difference either. They squeak like crazy after every bump in the road and going over speed bumps. If I could afford it I would get rid of them and buy better ones. I would not recommend these bushings to anyone. If you're looking for a cheap, durable resort to your broken bushings then sure. But I would invest in something a little less noisy and shaky."
2,Shipping Review of Energy Suspension 16.3116G,"Shipping Review of this Product.I got my product, the Energy Suspension 16.3116G Black Hyper-Flex Front Control Arm Bushing Set. through the mail and its a let-down. The package, a carton box was torn all over, when i took the product out. the plastic seems to have been open once before. staplers were already out of place and it seems to be missing a grease tube.This Product came with:1. 1 pair of Lower Arm Compliance bushing2. 1 pair of Lower Arm Arm Bushing3. 3 grease tubes4. 1 Installation InstructionI could be wrong, but I believe since i have 2 pair of bushings i should get 2 pairs of grease tubes.If anyone from the company is reading this. please send me the missing grease tube or correct me. Thank You.I've yet to install it on my 2001 Honda Civic Coupe EX. When I do I'll write a review about that."
1,The mechanic would not install them,"The mechanic would not install them because they couldn't verify the quality and the car could be unsafe or some crap. Maybe the mechanic was pulling one over on me, because they recommended installing brand new control arms with the bushing already installed. I guess these Energy Suspension bushings are for the do-it-you-self-er. I read great reviews from Civic message boards. Oh well, $590 later, I returned these bushings back to amazon."
5,A CLASSIC CAR..SO COOL!!!,THIS CAR HAS THRILLED MY GRANDSON WHO LOVES TO COLLECT CLASSIC CARS. IT WAS A TERRIFIC PURCHASE AND IT IS A LARGE CAR WITH ALOT OF WEIGHT. IT'S DIECAST METAL AND VERY DURABLE. A GREAT BUY FOR THE CAR COLLECTOR.
2,Cheap Cheap,"I know that these knives are inexpensive, but they are of much lower quality than the knives that I have purchased from IKEA, that cost less."
5,A MUST HAVE,"These are the best for authentic chinese cooking. The three volumes are filled with recipes from different regions, with pictures and very easy to follow instructions. I grew up with a a father who cooked gourmet food every day - needed something to help me ""take the flavors"" with me when I moved out and this is it! Perfect for the Chinese American wanting to re-create the foods from your parent's house (like me!) I originally borrowed these books, loved them so much and couldn't find them anywhere. Went all the way to Taiwan and scoured the bookstores to find them and never regretted the effort. Highly recommended."
5,Indespensable for teachers,"I hold an advanced degree in the field and this was an outstanding resource when teaching high school students. It had answers to most the the creative/odd/insightful questions they asked. Actually, this guide made reading the Iliad more interesting for me as well."
2,end coupling,I need to know the size of the end coupling and the number that comes in the order. How do you get this missing information?
1,Disappointing Bio,"I thought that spending almost $30 for a biography meant it would be a substantial one. Instead, it is less than an inch thick, with the binding and written by a childrens' author. It is a great book for kids but what about the adults? There is a photo of Stephen and his second wife on their wedding day but nothing written about their meeting and relationship. There is nothing about his belief change to intellegent design either. One of the greatest minds of our time deserves a more complete biography."
4,Fun pedal!,"This is an interesting pedal. You can learn about the specs online. My impression is that it's got a really nice growl when the distortion is on; I really love that sound. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it trying it in a store, and I still love it. It's been a unique sound for me so far (I don't own a ton of pedals, yet!). Without the distortion, it can be a decent simple envelope filter. It doesn't have too many tricks up its sleeve, but you can get it modded to take the internal trim pots outside and they tweak further parameters (or you can tweak them from inside the box... the mod I just described makes it convenient). I haven't done this, though. A further note for those unfamiliar with this stuff: It's built very well. EHX is one of the foremost innovators in the effects world, and they make quality stuff. I have no complaints with this pedal (no noise, no pop/click when I hit the footswitch, no tone suck, etc.)."
3,"Fun toy, not so useful","I wanted to love this effect. I used it on bass, and while the sounds it makes are fun to play with, there is little use for it in a band setting. Cool synthy sounds sometimes, but basically a one-trick pony."
2,Collection of TSR....,"If you are a fan of TSR collection, this is one of their choose your own adventure rip off book. Personally, i like all tsr books."
1,Overpriced for only 2 DVDs,"I bought this item for $74 thinking it was the ENTIRE DVD set of the World at War. It isn't. It's only for volume 1 and runs 7 hours on 2 DVDs. I wasn't able to get a refund from the seller. For ten dollars more, I could have bought the entire set from a different dealer, so I figured this was way overpriced for only two DVDs. Save your money and buy the entire box set for some excellent documentaries."
3,Bad,User sent me the wrong format. He sent me one that is for eurpoean origin. Took a while for me to get my money back
5,Days away,"This new band is under-rated. You listen to it once and you are hooked. You walk away thinking, ""wow, that is really good"" For being new they are off to a great start."
1,Did not like,I bought 2 of these hard drives and after a year of use I can no longer get my files off of them. I will never buy a Fantom drive again.
4,Sandlappers Cookbook,"I purchased this book at the Low Country Visitor's Center in South Carolina. It was recommended by one of the workers there as a good basic Southern cookbook, nothing too fancy, where you will mostly have all of the ingredients on hand. She was right. It has become one of my favorite cookbooks. I particularly like the recipes for corn cassarole and chocolate chip scones. Funny story with the scones...the 1st time that I was there at the center, they had scones for sale. I went to purchase one, and the two workers kindly warned me that I may not like them as they were a little hard, made by their manager who was from up north, and said that apparently that's the way they make them ""up there."" Well, I'm also a northerner, and I loved them. Afer making the scones in the Sandlappers cookbook though, I realized what they were talking about. The southern-stlye scone was fluffy- soft and nice freshed baked. They are very good --but I do like them both ways."
5,Extremely well-reasoned analysis,"Stop reading right now if you don't believe in evolution. Evolution is central to the book's tenets. The Paleolithic Prescription is far from a diet book. It builds a very compelling case from fossil records and modern-day hunter gatherers that the lifestyle our bodies have evolved to excel in consist of FAR more exercise and fiber and far less sugar and fat than our modern culture gives us.Whether you read this book to gain a better understanding of the human body or to simply inform your choices on diet and exercise with real science, it's a great read. Highly recommended."
2,Use a topical,"The topical formulas are much easier to apply, work fast and are much more effective than this.I'd hoped the shampoo would be better because of the cost and availablity factor, but it just didn't work. Maybe I needed to use it longer, but I wanted something to get rid of the fleas immediately since they were driving my ferret crazy."
5,Science and Engineering of Casting Solidification,"A classic text, essential to any engineer working with metal solidification."
1,Misery Indeed,"Deeply awful poetry. Another example, if another were needed, of what a good education can do to a woman."
3,not up to Haynes usual standards...,"Haynes has an admirable reputation for publishing clear, concise repair manuals for automobiles. This particular volume is troubling in its organization, its breadth of model year coverage and its inadequate depth of coverage of engine management systems. Haynes is an English firm, and this is an American published version of the English manual. As a result, this manual is objectionably weak at covering the electronic fuel injection and ignition systems found on most 1983 and newer US model Volvo's - which just happens to be one area of particular interest to most owners - what to do when the ""check engine"" light comes on. In this reviewer's opinion, the Bentley manual is considerably better. The Chilton manual, though weak on essentials, covers engine management reasonably well."
5,A must for any Volvo 240 enthousiast.,"Like most of the other Haynes' manuals, this is an indispensable item for any car enthousiast. The 240 manual is no exception. Clear descriptions and pictures where you need them. Don't touch the mechanicals of you Swedish Brick without one"
3,Great cross reference,"I'm finding that the Haynes Volvo 240 series manual is handy for cross refrence, using Chilton primarily. Haynes offers a bit different view of some diagrams and helps in understanding wording. Would give an average review."
5,PEOPLE NOT FIMILAR WITH THIS GROUP ARE SURE TO LIKE SOMETHIN,THIS CD IS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND CONTAINS VARIOUS TYPES OF MOODS AND BEATS WHICH ANYONE CAN APPRECIATE WETHER YOU LIKE RAP OR NOT. THIS GROUP HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST RAP GROUPS EVER!
3,Classics 2 outta 3 is still good....,"Well this is not what I would call an equal to there first 2 albums but it aint bad.Like most artists that have attempted the double disc task few have truely sucseeded and I would have to say thats what happened here.This 28 song album,had it been cut in half it could have easily been a 4 falling just short of 5 due to the fact that Thug Luv featuring 2-Pac is not the caliber of song that you would expect from a calaberation of hall of fame bound Bone and legendary Pac."
5,Classic stuff.......should rate WAY more than 5 starz.,"Bone is the best rap group EVER. Their music is just above everyone else in rap. This double cd showcases them at their finest. Its 28 tracks total, with about 125 minutes of great music. Right now, im listening to this cd, Disc 2 track #14 (Evil Paradise). Buy their albums now. If u only gonna buy one, buy this one. This stuff is amazing. DO NOT buy anything from 3-6 mafia, they copied Bone's style (unlike what the dude below says). Buy it now if u want the best music in the universe."
5,Bone is tha best!!!,"I think Bone is better than any rap group in the industry. They don't just sing, they're producers and very good business men. They're alaways on tha real and their creativity is unbelieveable.MO THUG LUV to all!"
2,Weak album but luv PAC,"this BONE album is the weakest of them all.big whip it's 2 discs.it's only 2 discs of crap.the only reason why ""I"" bought it was because 2-PAC is featured in it and that song he's in is dope."
2,2.5 Stars,"The Art Of War is too long and is full of filler material. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony really dissapoint with this album, it is their worst material ever. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Mediocre,"There are way too many soft songs on here, but it's got some standouts. The one with 2Pac is a waste. The solos aren't that good either. But there's some good stuff on it, so check it out."
5,MO MONEY1111111111111111111,"So tell me some thing, what exactly do,and who are ya'll talking about in the background of both cd's THE ART OF WAR. If you(Krayzie,Layzie,Bizzie,Wish,or Dat Nigga Flesh)could please let me know. THANKZ MO THUGGIN SINCE 93..."
5,you'll envision how thugstas play,hands down by far one of tha best bone albums PERIOD no exceptions in my opinion....you just cant get enough of it.everytime you finish hearing it you'll wanna go back n listen some more...if you havent gotten this bone album i really dont know what your doing haha i recommend it to anybody whos a true fan to hiphop...this is as good as it gets..n thats real.
5,Best of the Bone,"I had this album for a while now but I can't help but to keep bumpin' this CD, this is one of their best work. They definitely kept their style andn stuff, Bone Thugs forever"
3,LandOfTheHeartless,"first off, ol dude from texas mind ya bizness cause u aint from neither place. aint nobody tryin to see nobody, thats bone and them, not me and them so watch urself playa. anyway this cds was best if it had half the songs, mostly the up beat songs, twista may have had it first but bone took it to anotha level, thug style besides pac they started the thuggin u see now wit everybody and they got mo ends than all of them from chi-town put 2gether. twista is hard though.Cleveland 4 lifeWe on Fire Fa Sho"
5,Best Bone CD ever; even better than E. 1999 Eternal,Art of War is the a really cool CD. It is even better than E. 1999 Eternal which is very hard to beat.
3,Where the flop started,"Bone Thugs quickly fell off after this album dropped, and its not hard to see why. They try here to create a creepy, mystical album, kind of like Wu Tang Forever (also a 1997 release), but really just manage to rework every idea in their repetoire (we're thugs, we smoke weed, we're from Cleveland, don't F*** with us, etc). The production, almost all by DJ U-Neek is awesome tho, especially on the first CD."
4,somethin ridiculous,"this is one dope album. the first disc is just crazy and the second disc ain't as good but it still is wicked. the best songs r if i could teach, look in2 my Iz, thug luv and its all real and hatin nation."
3,BoneThugsnHarmony 's Problem,"""The Art Of War"" is a good cd! It just seems as if BoneThugsnHarmony have one problem! It's ""Tha Crossroads (Remix)"", which gave these youngsters major airplay, publicity and fame. I think that since then all they have been trying to do, is to ""copy"" this unique style. Therefore I think that they lost originality (which they definately had on ""Creepin' On Ah Comeup"" and ""E.1999"") and all their songs started to sound repetitive! Don't get me wrong, I love BoneThugs, but it's the truth! Bone had a good start with their sophmore release ""Creepin on Ah ComeUp"" (thanx to Eazy!) - 4 stars- and the groundbreaking effort ""E.1999"" - definately 5stars. I think that ""The Art of War"" started BTNH's downward spiral. ""BTNHResurrection"" and ""Thug World Order"" are nowhere close to these cd's! Still, BTNH will always stay one of my favorite groups. Buy this double cd! ""THUG LUV"" w/2Pac is great!"
2,"A DISAPOINTED MUSIC FAN FROM SAN DIEGO, CAL","This is one of the most disapointing c.d.'s. ever. There's only one good song one the album, Body Rott, and 2 fairly good songs Ain't nothing changed, and Thug Luv with 2 pac. Other than that its one of tha most disapointing out there. But I've got to give them some credit cause the collection vol 1, and their 2nd album were pretty tight c.d.'s"
2,2 discs that could've been narrowed to two songs.,"I was excited about getting this album, afterall Bone is one of the best groups out there. Hopes were high, maybe they just were 'cause this album really sucked. Why a double album? This album got me so mad I almost had to slap the guy who sold it to me for letting it into their store. ""It's All Real"" was jammin' and ""Thug Luv"" was the only song on there that sounded like previous Bone songs. Of course, it had 2pac on it. That's a real rapper, not many people can rap that good after being cremated."
2,damn this album is too overated,"i been had this album when i first came out but i had to react to some of the ratings. I am a true bone fan but this was nothin. The BTNH Resurrection was way better than this including the 2 classics ""Creepin oh ah come up"" and "" E.1999 Eternal"" which i wouldn't dare compare to this dissapointment. The were only like 3 tracks on each disc that were tight. Bye hearing the intro i thought it was going to be a another E.1999 Eternal and Creepin oh ah come up. To me the intro Retaliation, Thug Luv, and If i could teach the World were the best also whom die they lie was ok. To save your money buy the Resurrection and the 2 before this which were untouchable."
1,Three six is way better,"bone copied the tripple six mafias styles, three six is way better than bone, if you don't think so buy World domination by 3-6"
5,the only unsurpassed album by BTNH!,"this is bone thugs n harmony at their finest! they did top e.99 in terms of melody and beats..furthermore, their rapping style has matured. this double album will make you crave for more AoW kind of album, but sorry y'all..they can't do it again. favorite tracks are Handle The Vibe, Look Into My Eyes, Body Rott, If I Could Teach The World, Family Tree, Wasteland Warriors, Evil Paradise and alot more. the whole 2cd is packed with great songs!"
5,This album be hella tight!!! YEEEEEAH!,"Hey, yo this album is the shiznat! If you ain't heard of this rap group yet, then you gotta check 'em out because your ears haven't lived yet until you do. They bring about a new style of rap that is not your run-of-the-mill rap sound. It has a melodic flow to it that it almost soothing to the ear. They'll go from aggressive to beautiful and they lend it so well. If you like this style of rap, you GOTS ta check out this fly group called the Deftones from Sacramento, Cali who bust the most wicked rhymes over hip-hop/metal rhythms! It is SICK! You gotta check it out! Word! --Kelly Magovern"
3,Quatermass,I really like the movie so I thought the original would be just as good. Sorry to say that's it's ok but not like the movie. One of the episodes freezes up so I had to skip that one. Otherwise the DVD played fine.Shipping was really fast.
2,Quartermass and The Pit - The Classic 1958-59 BBC Television Version Starring Andre Morell,I have not contacted Amazon yet nor watched this DVD to see if it plays OK but after opening the shrinkwrap found a heavy manufacturing scratch on the playing side of the disc. I will have to play and check this to see if it is OK as soon as possible but am disappointed it is in this condition.
3,"There's a normal film, and this 6 part TV series.","This is what is probably the original TV serial in 6 episodes. It's the same story by the same originator, but with a different cast. Also, it has shabbier production values, is in black and white, and is a slower less effective presentation. I wanted the 98 minute, color film that I saw on TV back in the '80s, but instead got this cheaper older version of the story."
5,A Little Known SciFi Classic from Britains TV Land!,"Greetings!Being that the 1967 cinematic remake is prohibitively expensive on DVD; and having the same on VHS (yikes!),I elected to try the original TV Serial. Enjoyably overacted, perhaps a bit much for those with no early TV exposure,this Pre-Cinematic Quatermass & The Pit is equally entertaining, and not that much different from its later offspring.Look to other reviews for the plot if you must; at this price, I encourage all SciFi Fans to order a copy, and enjoy alittle-known sleeper that I trust will impress, even if just a little!"
3,The ending ruined it for me. How do I rate it?,"I enjoyed this movie right to the end. But then I felt really ripped off. I have to give it credit for the entire movie keeping me watching. But I have to subtract for the fact that the ending ruined the whole viewing experience and left me angered with the writer, producer, director, and studio. If the ending had been different, I would have given it a 5. As it stands, I feel quite generous to rate it a three."
2,Bad Seed Plus Sex,"Girl loves her father too well and does bizarre things because of it. If you like happy endings, skip this one."
4,Comic Tragedy,"Okay, I've read some of what my fellow reviewers have said about this film and some are wrong. Folks, you may not want to believe this, but there really are people out there like this. Yes, there really are cheesy detectives and there really are kids like the Julia Stiles character, Ellie. As a matter of fact, Ellie resembles a highly developed RAD diagnosis. They are manipulative, they are obsessive, and they have no empathy. They can kill without a care if it suits their plan.You may laugh at this film, as reality through Ellie's eyes can be so absurd that it's funny, but overall, the film has more truth to it than you may want to admit."
1,Wicked? Er... if you say so............zzzzzzzzzzzzzz......,"When I saw the cover of this video - showing a gorgeous girl looking decidedly evil I thought 'hey, my kinda film'. Especially with blurb like 'evil never looked so good'. Yet the film was a complete pile of cat's poo!We never saw Stiles do one really wicked thing in the whole film!They should sue the marketing guys under the trade descriptions act!For fans of evil, beautiful girls doing really bad things and revelling in their sinful ways this film was a big disapointment.Forget this film and buy a pair of socks instead."
1,I wish I could give it less than one star,"Obviously a remake of some foreign film, this DVD has a great cast playing paper-thin and stereotyped characters. Stiles plays a typically lippy teen who takes on her mother's role when the mother is gruesomely murdered. Since the DVD package contains a spoiler for the film, I won't be revealing anything here you can't get from the packaging. Adultery, incest, murder, and inexplicable partnerships turn this movie into a muddled mess and the ending is predictable 20 minutes out. If you need an example of a bad film for class, this may be the only reason to get this DVD."
2,"How Did This Get An ""R"" Rating???","I'm going to get right ot the point here. This movie is WAY too drawn out. The acting by anyone besides Ms. Stiles is trivial, non-believable, and just plain bad. The plot will keep you guessing until just about the end...and that is the best I can say.Now, for my blast at the rating...The movie is rated ""R"". The opening pre-credit says, ""contains explicit sexuality"". When I'm warned about something, I expect to see it. There isn't so much as a nude scene in this film. The ""R"" is actually for language...dropping the F-Bomb a couple times.Lame and not worth the time."
2,Wicked,"Probably my fault, but I thought I was buying ""Wicked"" about the green witch who was always misunderstood in ""The Wizard of Oz."" I was unable to see the play version and thought this was it. I haven't looked at this one; and probably won't."
3,"Not bad, but not all that original or believable","Unfortunately, this is not a very strong film. Stiles is by far the best actor in this, with all the other performances quite weak (with the exception of the detective).Stiles plays a deeply troubled child, who is attempting to manipulate her father. To a certain extent, she succeeds, but events begin to slip from her control. The ending is designed to throw the viewer for a loop, but I found it rather predictable. The film most succeeds on the atmospherics, which takes place in a surreal gated community, complete with a lonely single mother, a seductive nanny, a deadbeat sensualist neighbor, and a dysfunctional family. The mix leads to murder and nothing quite ends up as it seems, but I just didn't quite believe it.I would recommend this tepidly."
3,intresting,i was watching this movie on lifetime yesterday (don't ask my why i was watching lifetime) and i got intrigued when i was watching this movie.......something to think about
2,I'm just not sure...,I don't know... this stuff just didn't leave me feeling like my hair was at it's shiniest. It gets 2 stars because I use the empty bottle to hold the human souls I collect.
5,Kingston RAM,"kinston technologies RAM is an exxcellent choice, and getting it through AMAZON.com is an even better choice. I am very happy with the service from both companies, and plan on continuing my business with both. Thanks Amazon and Kingston Technologies for providing very excellent products and service..BassPlaya"
3,Something sad,"Although I bought this memory with the specifications of the motherboard, I have left a bad taste in my mouth because I do not recognize more than 2.8 gb, my operating system is Windows 7 x64."
5,This book is a great read!,"I agree with everyone else, this is a GOOD book!The only problem I had with it was that there are no pictures of the people involved. I like to see the people in the story, I really dont know why but I think it helps to see them in my mind's eye. But, otherwise I loved the book.If it was fiction I'd have a hard time believing it."
5,Best Crime Book Ever Read,"This is absolutely the best crime book I have ever read...and I have read many. It was almost unbelieveable how Candy Montgomery could kill Betty and then continue her day as if nothing happened. I only wish there had been pictures in this book. I have searched the internet for any pictures but haven't found any, so if anyone knows of a website where pictures could be found."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!!,"With great trepidation do I give this one star, for I fear the wrath of St. Alphonsus. The author's ideas are wonderful.However, this edition of his work is absolutely horrific. This earned a single star because of the number of typographical, punctuation and spelling errors present in the text. On page 18, which is the first page of the saint's work, one finds five of these errors (including misspelling the Latin ""sacerdos"" as ""SaceVdos""?!); three on the next page, two on the next, three on the next, and four on the next...and I could keep going, but I tire of this sort of thing. These are not grammatical oddities specific to the translator's time and usage. These errors are editorial ones made in transcription, and the blame goes entirely to St. Athanasius Press.I want my money back."
3,So much potential...,As a horse lover I was left pretty disappointed. The concept was awesome and rich with possibilities but it all fell pretty flat. I really wanted to love it!
4,The Song Not Included,"You know the ending of the Italian Job? When he explains the future for each of the members of the team? The music for that bit is not mentioned, but after some digging, I discovered it was Money by Pink Floyd."
4,What is the song?,"The CD is great to chill too!!! Doing homework, eating what ever! But I do have one question.....What is the name of the song earlier on in the film where Charlize Theron gets a call from her dad?....When she's in bed and she get's woken up by the phone. Please help me out!"
1,Missing Tracks,"I understand that the original score for a movie cannot consist only of rock songs, there must be orchestra music to compliment the atmosphere. HOWEVER. I would like to be able to purchase the rock tracks that set the mood on several occasions (Boomkat - The Wreckoning is a good example).I am willing to buy these tracks on one CD. I am NOT willing to buy mutliple CDs at 25$cdn a go in order to get a small amount of tracks off of each CD. I'll burn my own, thank-you.Once again the recording industry attempts to force us to pay exhorbitant amounts of money for a CD on which we may (or may not) enjoy a maximum of 3 tracks; yet they whine when we download the music for free off of the internet."
3,Where's the non-orchestrated music ?,"The orchestrated music is good, but there are a lot songs not done by the Hollywood Orchestra that are not on the CD but major songs in the movie? Anyone have a complete list of the missing songs (like the cool wah wah guitar driven riff when Charlie and Stella are in the junk yard and she's meeting all the team for the first time)?"
3,Lacking,"The film was punctuated with great and inspired little cuts of rock songs. Unfortunately, none of these made it to the CD. The overall orchestral background music of the film is good and the CD is worth getting if you liked it. But it would have been more representative of the film and so much better if they had included some of the songs as well."
3,To those of you still looking,"I have downloaded part of the soundtrack. The song being played while the girl and Mark Wahlberg are in the MINI, on their way to meet the rest of the crew, is NOT California Soul by Marlena Shaw."
5,Which song is this?,"I am trying to find this song and I'm pulling my hair out 'cause I can't find it!It is the sequence when they are in the warehouse working on the mini coupers...the song now is used in a commercial too!It uses these words: ""what comes around, what goes around...time to get down!""What is the name of the title and freaking sings that damn song!!!???Please!!!!"
5,re: whats that tune,"the tune your lookking for that is also not on the cd is called ""to get down"" by ""timo mass"" it rockSSSS"
3,title of song,what was the name of the song played when Mark Walberg and the girl in the mini cooper met together in LA with the other 3 guys for the first time as they each were introduced and reflected upon their past- basically when each character arrived in their own vehicle.
1,"Also searching for ""Money""","The credits went by very quickly - I could only see that the cover of ""Money"" was by a temporary super-group of various contemporary rockers whose names I could ID but couldn't retain, as I foolishly assumed it would be on the soundtrack or easily found on the Web.So hope someone will post the names!"
2,No Money???,"The one song I was looking to buy this for was 'money' buy velet revolver. I can't believe it is not on the soundtrack??? It played during the movie, then in the end credits - the guitar solo is killer!!!! How can they leave it off the soundtrack???? Yes that is correct, because of money..."
1,not product pictured,the product pictured in the description is not a control arm bushing. it is an aftermarket axle seal. hope amazon changes this soon
2,"alright, not great.","Ordered this product online since it was the cheapest bike tube i could find and i recently got a flat tire from riding all summer. It arrived on time but while I was trying to put it on my bike I noticed a faulty in the product, there was a small air bubble in the tube rubber when it was manufactured so it had a weak spot that would probably give way after riding, i don't think this is universal for all these tubes it was just that the one I got had a weak spot. I returned it to the seller and they kindly sent me another one that was fine (I asked them to inspect it). Also, the nozzel on this product is the newer kind so you'll have to buy an adapter at a bike store which is only about fifty cents if you're going to use the older pumps to inflate it. Hopefully get back on the road soon, i go about 15 miles 3-4times a week. Keep Riding! -peace-"
4,"An evocative, moving and strangely captivating film.","This movie glides gently along, apace with the slow healing of a young widow's loss. With utterly minimal characterisation, the director still manages to capture vivid glimpses of Japan, both old and young. Most memorable is the beautiful and dramatic coastal scenery which is hauntingly powerful. At times, a heartbreakingly lonely film, it proceeds with its own calm logic, and the effect is quietly, yet deeply moving."
4,Feeling painful loss is in this movie.,"A maborosi is a beckoning light that the sea lulls sailors to their doom with. Yumiko's husband was lulled, not at sea but on the train tracks...There is nothing American about this movie. The rythm is very, very slow, the culture different. Makiko Esumi is mesmerizing as the bereaved young wife Yumiko.The slowness of the action puts the sense of loss at the painfull centre of everything, like something you just can't avoid. In time, the pain lifts, and Yumiko lives again. How very much like real life."
3,I just couldn't get into it . . .,"I love Japanese and Chinese movies, so I had high expectations for this one. But it was . . . too slow. Not in a good way. I'm used to slow movies, but this was too inert.I understand the main character's grief--we all know what it's like to lose a loved one to death or splitting apart, and how long it takes to recover. The movie did a good job of accentuating that, but the movie is just too uneventful, even for a foreign movie.Still good, though."
1,doesnt work dull and boring,"interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere. kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative, poorly composed, and add little or nothing to the experience. looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line. i've lived in rural japan and it's the most boring place on earth (perhaps the intent here but hardly something you'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only), you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all?"
4,Exquisite Portrayal of Japanese Culture,"This movie is the best I've seen that accurately captures the heart of Japanese psyche and its impact on culture that's so different than that of Americans. Each FRAME of this movie is a masterful ""painting"" that unites the mood of the character with that of the nature. I've rarely seen such (self-conscious) perfection in each frame as in this movie.I cannot give it five stars, because while this movie has a daring vision that builds power over time, it's difficultfor American audience to relate fully to what amounts toa slide show, albeit an incredibly artistic one.Contrast this film with ""Red Soghum"", which is a virtuoso depiction of the true essence of the Chinese culture.For those who are fed up with the increasingly formulaicexcuse of a movie from Hollywood, try these two gems,which actually require you to use your brain to analyze and comprehend."
4,"Good,but not the best","This is good book, but really expensive and short.This is about backgrounds in manga,and this book teaches how to make background , what shows mangahumans feelings.This book has about 4 pages whit naked mangahumans, so this is up 13 aged.Im 13 and i like this series"
2,Favorites of the past,All the famous favorites are here and done exactly as you remember them. I was hoping for something that put a new feel to the oldies and this was not it. If you are looking for great European relaxing music check out Mediterranean Nights by various artist and Azucar by Luciani.
5,"Perfect ""Mood"" Music","A ""Romantic"" journey, perfect ""mood"" music...yeah, it had my wife panicing too. We're planning a trip to Tuscany, so I bought this to fill her head with dreams of scenic Italian landscapes. The classics on this CD are some of the most beautiful (and catchy) pieces of music to come from the list of great masters. It has truly set the ""mood"" for searching airline prices, rental cars and lodging...the tedious part of planning a ""Romantic Journey""."
4,I found something new !,"Having found Allison later than most, i started with the Definitive Collection. That is far more for the offering than this, but it is what made me buy this dvd/cd combo. Great price too.The show is a straight forward small venue in Nashville which are great places to be, and she and visiting sister Shelby do a fine job. Raw, simple, just pull up a chair at the table and have a drink and enjoy honest music.This is not a top notch A/V production but her talents still shine through and is very good. After all she does consider herself somewhat a rebel. Go for it."
1,could not be viewed!,"i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money."
4,"Fun series, but do we really need dead parents?","OK, so I really like the main characters... they are playful, clever and fun ... but ...Why is it necessary to have a dead mother and/or distant/cruel father in the plot of EVERY kids series?Please, authors of the world.... stop repeatedly exposing children to the single most horrifying thing they can possibly imagine. It's like sticking a screwdriver into kids brains and twisting it.Why is it that kids books and children's videos resort to vicious psychological games with children? Oh, that's right.... psychological trauma causes a child's to want to repeat an experience in a simulated manner in order to understand it. This results in the child wanting to buy toys, costumes, new episodes.Please stop screwing with kids brains for fun and profit.The series would have been *fine* with the kids parents alive and well and supportive of their needs. See ""Spy Kids"" for an example."
2,I don't really understand all the hype....,"I'd give the Last Airbender series a rating somewhere between 2 and 3 stars, I guess. I honestly don't really see what all the excitement is about it. I mean, occasionally it can be fun--I think Sokka's rather funny--but for the most part, the voice acting isn't very good,and the dialogue definitely leaves something to be desired. The fights can be pretty neat, I will say, but there are lots of much better animated shows with better fighting.Of course, even the problems with the animated series are greatly dwarfed by those in the Last Airbender non-animated movie, which I think is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. But I still would suggest seeking out other animated shows. While it could be worse, it is overrated."
1,"Opened and used but marked as ""new""","I was extremely disappointed when I received this item. My son noticed that the box that the DVDs were in was not in the best shape (looked like it had been opened) and when he opened the box one of the DVDs appeared to be missing. However, on further inspection it was stuck in with another DVD. I complained to Amazon but NO ONE returned my e-mail. I will definitely think twice the next time I order a DVD and will probably not order from Amazon again. If I could give Amazon less than 1 star I would!!!"
5,Great movies! My kids love it!,My kids love these. They can hardly stop watching them. They can't wait to save up the money to buy the Earth series.
4,"Item is great, but some minor problems.","I love the Avatar series. This was a great buy at a reasonable price. My only problem with it is that the quality of the first disc was bad. When I was watching it, it looked like there were two layers of animation playing at the same time and one of the layers was slightly shifted out of place. It was a little distracting, but not bad enough for me to return it. Also, I haven't seen any reviews with the same complaint, so it may just be the set that I got.Anyways, if you are a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, this is definitely worth buying."
5,Where is book 2 collectors edition?!?!?!?,"It's been almost 2 years people. I would rather all my DVD boxes match! lolOtherwise, this is awesome.I am 22 yrs old and married. Yes we're nerds."
5,"5 stars for the show, no stars for the ""Collector's Edition""","I was really looking forward to getting this Collector's Edition and see what extras were added. I knew it wasn't a lot - just a mini-book and a documentary - but I figured it would be packaged in a cool way.Wrong.As others have already mentioned, the Collector's Edition is *literally* theAvatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 Collectionslipped into another cardboard box, with a little booklet and DVD in an envelope (not even a case!) wedged in. It's really disappointing; it would have been so easy to create a quality Collector's Edition but the studio couldn't be bothered, I guess."
3,Not Any different,"This DVD is not any different than the normal Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 Collection (2005. The only it has as an extra is an artbook that is nothing more than a teaser advertisement for a larger artbook.I love the serie, and I love the extras, but I especially love the fact that I didn't get suckered into buying this collection for more than the original collection. Especially since it is the same thing as the original. If you have the, Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 Collection from 2005, don' buy this. If you want to buy the first season with a better cover, only buy this if it is cheaper, or the same price as the original one."
5,Fun for whole family!,My family enjoys watching this show together. The DVD collection is great to have because it is difficult to find it on TV. A wonderful story.
5,Avatar is Great,"The Avatar Book 1 Collection is excellent. Since I am a fan of anime, this is one of my favorites. I recommend this for everyone who likes anime."
2,Avatar first episode,Wouldn't go onto my mp3 player. It said that it wouldn't work on zune software or something like that. Took about 6 hours to download.
5,Avater the last air bender book 1,It is a great cartoon. i watched on tv and I liked it so much i wanted to buy it.
5,"Greate deal, allot of chapters!","Its greate,I buy it for my friend and now Im the one how is watching it!"
5,A fantastic show!,"This is a great show that I can watch with my kids that we all enjoy. It is really worth getting and you will enjoy it immensely.I do have a complaint, not with the show but with Paramount. They have commercials for their other Nick shows on each and every disc, mostly the same ones over. I feel that as a paying customer these should not be on movies that I purchase. It is so bad, they even have a commercial to buy Avatar Season 1. Think about that one for a second."
5,Avatar the last Airbender-The Complete book 1 Collection,My son just loves the series and was delighted to get this so he could watch it from beginning to end. I plan to get him the next series when it comes out
5,AMAZING SHOW!,"After watching the movie in theaters and seeing a lot of fans for the cartoon, we decided to watch the anime version. IT was so much more worth our time than the movie! Aang is the most adorable, cute, funny hero and all the other characters just as lovable! My whole family ranging from adult to three-years old were entertained. We will be working our way through the whole three seasons of laughter!"
5,very good show,"Some people say ""Its just a cartoon."" But it is a really good show with a message and cheracters you learn to love."
4,The sentimental values,"When I ordered this it didn't come with the episode guide as it should have, I feel that this is a very important part of my order.In the future please give other the episode guide that they deserve oppose to us getting it from Walmart and I would like you to send it to me please"
1,Nick Over-Controls DVD Functions,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. Nick has given the consumer a poor experience by taking control of the DVD functions at the beginning of each of the 6 disks. It forces you to watch about 5 minutes of commercials, coming Nick shows, and shows that my children dislike. Other companies once did this and then quit on customer feedback. While we enjoy =eventually= watching the shows, the DVDs are not acceptable due to their hijacking of the DVD. Do what other consumers do, give Nickelodeon the feedback that this deserves and don't bother purchasing the first manufacture run of these until they release your DVD to allow you to choose what you want."
2,Saturday morning cartoons,"I didn't get very far into it - it's very childish, with slapstick comedy and childish pouting. It looks like a very predictable Saturday morning cartoon show."
5,Simply the best thing on TV right now,I recommend this series to adults and children alike. My daughter and I watch it over and over and can't get enough.
5,American Best,"For an American made Anime Style Cartoon Avatar is a show I would recommend to any one. It may look a childish but old and young alike can come to like this. It is able o produce character development, Love , and comedy all while keeping a well developed storyline. If you love anime, cartoons, or want to try something new this is something you would want to check out."
5,Great for kids and Adults,"This entire series is well done and you cannot help but be attached to the characters by the end. Do not be turned off by the movie, it missed the point of the show entirely. I would say that while there is much action, it is not overly violent and there are always consequences to their behavior. The show also address how to handle emotional issues such as loss, anger, and love on a level that young kids can understand and relate to. My kids love it, and it beats watching some of their other favorite shows."
3,"Good show, terrible DVD's","Don't know what the problem is, but it feels like they put extremely low-res recordings of the episodes to DVD, straight from an old television. The image is grainy, and colors horribly oversaturated. The audio track is also suspect: it sounds too high-pitched on any system I try playing them on. Not sure if I'd recommend this product, not because of the show (this is great viewing for young teenagers and even some older audiences), but because of the re-production. Hopefully they'll release some better media for this show eventually."
3,"Rating the DVD's, Not the anime.","This review is strictly the package, it has nothing to do with my thoughts on the anime.There are some serious issues with disc 1. Very VERY poor quality, everything is blurred. It seems like some part of the animation is off. Luckily this is not continued with the other discs. I have exchanged this package 3 times with every disc 1 being the same way. I just assume thats how they all are or i am just really out of luck. Hopefully we will get a new release (blu ray maybe?) after that lackluster ""Limited Edition"". An extra booklet and some commentary for an extra 20 bucks i think ill pass."
5,A series that never get old,"I am now 61 years old and have been watching this show since its debut in 2005 and I'm still watching it. I have all the dvd's including the collector's editions and I view them constantly on Amazon Prime, I also have graphic books and novels. Stating that I am a Airbender junkie is an understatement. Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino, the creators, are geniuses...they've created something that is timeless and a show that has something for all ages.I will never tire of this show!"
5,Avatar Book 1 DVD Set,"This is a great set if you like the show. We watch it as a family on the weekends so when Santa's Amazon elves sent this to us, we were thrilled to be able to review the entire first season. We can't wait for Book 2 (Season 2) to be available!"
5,Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 Collection Keeps Givin' More!,"The Avatar Book 1 DVD is my kinda thing. The great Nickelodian TV show has tons of viewers and buyers of their products and shows. In this DVD see the story of an airbender named Aang as he is on a quest to learn the arts of bending to become a true avatar. This DVD holds all twenty episodes of the first season including the making of it, the very first episode never shown on TV, and much more. If you are an Avatar fan then this is your first stop to learn a lot more about it.Also check out the upcoming season 2 discs coming soon!"
4,Excellent Series,"When I first saw Avatar, I didnt really like it that much becuase it (the illustrations )appears too kidsie for me but I know the story is very good and so I am giving it another try with a more open mindness . I am watching the series in sequence ,that's why I bought the dvd box set .My only problem is the quality of the compression of the dvd.The images in the background are not crisp.I thought it was my eyes but its not,and it is not the the dvd since the player is a very good Sony HDMI player and I have no quality problems playing other 2D animations on it.Or maybe it is just my copy, who knows."
5,One of The Greatest Cartoons Ever,"I dispise Anime.I dispise it, and virtually anything influenced by it in an obvious way. So you can only imagine my shock and surprise when I began to see ad's for this show before it came on the air and I actually found it interesting.""Not Your Average Kids Show"" is the only term I can think of right now, although it doesn't give it any justice. The quality of the show is amazing, and for animation fans, it's no suprise that part of my love for this show is that it's still done by hand first, something sorely lacking from the current animation generation. That aside, you have brilliant writing, thought provoking plots and battles... it isn't classic ""good vs. evil"", since even most villians turn out to fall into a gray area.The fact that this cartoon exists and is done the way it is is a testament to the fact that Nickelodeon is looking for quality TV shows and not just simple profits. This show is brilliant in ways I can not begin to describe!"
5,Best animated show ever!,"This show is awsome. season two is my favorite, but one is still great!Perfect for all ages. Do not miss out. Buy season's two and three."
5,great show BUT DISC LACK SUBTITLES,"The show is an absolute gem thus the 5 star rating. But I must admit I am sadly disappointed and surprised that Nik. would produce a series of disk THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN SUBTITLES! If you, or your children, are hard of hearing/deaf I guess you can only watch the shows on nickolodeon where subtitles are present and forgo these disc! Also the disc contain no episode guide; poor production if you ask me."
4,A very nice cover,"This particular release is in fact a ""repackage"" of the original season one box set with a new slip cover and a making of DVD. The cover is cool and the making of DVD inspiring; however if you already own season one you may just wish to hold off on this purchase in case they release a true new version such as a full Blu-Ray collection of the show. All in all though it's a good purchase as long as your buying it for the first time."
5,Great series for fans of Asian Myth,"This is one the best animated shows to have come out in the last decade. This show was hours of fun. The philosophy/spirituality of the show is amazingly well written and incorporated without being overly preachy. There is a great deal of imagination in the show, but everything focuses around the story which is amazing. A+"
5,Masterful show,"When this show debuted in Feb. 2005, I didn't know anything about this show let alone hear about it at the time of its release on Nickelodeon. After a while I started hearing about this show but never tried watching a episode knowing how most shows seem to be at least to me that air on Nickelodeon. Although it took me 6 months after the series ended for me to get into the show and I have to say starting with Season 1, I didn't realize how good this show is. All 20 episodes that make up this collection I have to say are well written and I couldn't have done any better if I was part of the team behind the show. Season 1 gets a big 5 stars out of 5."
4,an excellent series,I'd liked the episodes here and there I had seen on TV so bought this entire series when I saw it watching all the episodes in order made them even more enjoyable. This is an enjoyable Fantasy series.
5,my kids love it,My kids resisted watching this for a while but when they finally sat down to it they loved it. They have been plowing through the first season.
5,"Thoughtful, fun, creative series for kids and adults","Our whole family loves this series, which plays kind of unpredictably on Nickelodeon. It's wonderful to be able to watch the episodes without commercials and in succession, since they very much build on one another. Avatar is a very creative, beautifully drawn animated series in which a group of children/youths team up ""to restore balance to the universe."" There is enough fighting to keep kids interested but real violence is presented as wrong, even when the enemy is violent themselves. So much deeper than anything else we watch as a family!"
5,"Very interesting, well rounded story.","I am currently deployed to Iraq, so on my off time I find that I have time to catch up on TV shows that I have missed lately. I had caught a couple episodes of this series, just enough to pique my interest. I ordered the first season, and wow. The story is much more in-depth than I would expect from a children's show on Nickelodeon. The characters are well fleshed out and personable. The animation is top-notch. I ordered the second season before I even finished all of the first. Highly recommended.For the 2 that gave this 1 star, I have no idea what you are talking about. I had no problems skipping the intro previews. Either your DVD player is whacked, or they changed the DVD format."
5,Another wonderful Avatar box set,Fantastic set! It is really nice to watch Avatar without all the stupid..and I mean stupid commercials. The shows were what were advertised and the extras were quite interesting.
3,for kids>? YES for anyone older>? NO,this movie would b cool if i was a 10 year old girl...basically this movie is surrounded by young singer on romeo's record label forest lipton. its just a long music video.... the girl can sing though... i just wish they did not make her sing so much in the movie... if i wanted to see all kinds of singing i would watch dreamgirls again...this movie is good for children that like childish humor...2.9 out of 5 stars
5,Elisa,"Although I still haven't found that album in my homecountry, as no-one knows her in BElarus, I'm still looking forward to buying this album! I've downloaded a few tracks and all I can say that Elisa's unfailingly gorgeous! her insightful vocals bring out this nostalgic, philosophic, sometimes melancholy , but sometimes vigorous mood! her lyrics are written from the heart and as someone said ""they run whole range from poetic to primitive"", I don't see anything primitive there... sometimes simple things and words have much deeper meaning than hypocritic sublime words that just sound well... but I truly agree that some of her songs are incredibly poetic and sensitive..."
3,It was a good book but....,"I've enjoyed the Merlin's Legacy series since I stumbled across it in the book store and have not been able to put them down since. However I was a little disappointed in the way that this book came to an end. I was very upset to learn the Conner had died after only a few years with Meg. Also I found that the book lacked the heart that her others had in them. Add that to the fact that it looked like the author went a little wild with the cut and paste buttons, several of the passages were EXACTLY the same as previous ones. I still will continue to read the future books that come out under this title I just hope that they are more original and have more heart than this book has."
3,Meg and Connor's daughter comes on the scene!,"I eagerly awaited this book. The last five were so good that the sixth had to be a blockbuster. Unfortunately it didn't turn out that way. In this book Meg and Connor's daughter, Rianne, is full grown and has to be found. Tristan is sent on the hunt and inevitably the two are thrust together. I wont tell all, but there isn't the same passion and romance in this story as there was in the others. There is plenty of description; lot's and lot's in fact. I wonder if the author was in a rush to get this out because it doesn't have her usual fire. Merlin's Legacy is such a great story to tell. The book leaves you wide open to continue it. I hope the author keeps going!!"
4,marvelous anecdotes,"Being a long time fan of the chef series, I finally got series One and Two on DVD, a nice upgrade from the old taped VHS version.Both series are great, sound and picture wise a little lacking, but who cares when it is the dialog, the insults and totally blown out of proportion tantrums, you want to watch. I am exstatic that i have them in my collection now, for years of enjoyment, as you can easily watch many of the episodes over and over.If you are a fan like me get ,1 and 2, don't bother about series 3.Peter, Manly vale Sydney Australia"
5,Superb!,"As is the norm with albums done by Third Day, this one is superb.This has a definite rock flavor in comparison to their worship albums. The lyrics continue to be meaningful. The sound is top notch. Their musical abilities are amazing and Mac Powell's voice is incredible.This is a great CD for any fan of Christian music. It is also one that any rock fan can enjoy.Some of the really great tracks on this are as follows: Come On Back to Me, 'Til the Day I Die, Wire, and Blind.I would definitely recommend this."
4,Third Day rocks out ...,"I agree with Dustin Moore. People need to remember not to judge these guys by what their lyrics are saying. It is clearly revealed that the members of Third Day know that God Almighty is Ruler and King. They may not use Christ or God in any of the lyrics on this CD, but if you listen closely to the lyrics and read the words, you know these guys love more than anything else, the Lord, Jesus Christ. The choir director at our church has stated to us (I am a tenor singer) that no matter what you sing about, as long as you are doing the Lord's work, that is what matter's and pleases God most of all. So, to Third Day, I say keep doing what you do. Looking forward to the tour."
2,Misses the point,"I have always loved Third Day, especially how they combine solid Rock N Roll with solid Christ-centered lyrics. Their Offerings CD's were much lighter musically but still solid biblically. I had hoped that they would return to their Rock roots and on Wire, they have done just that. Unfortunately, in the process, they have left Jesus out of the music (His name is nowhere to be found on the entire album). Several of the songs have absolutely no spritual value and those that seem to be Christian make only the slightest hints to Whom they refer. If you are looking for some good secular Rock N Roll, you will like this CD but if you are looking for any spiritual edification or Christ-honoring lyrics, go elsewhere or listen to their old stuff."
2,Decidedly Average,"Being a huge Third Day fan buying any new release of theirs is never a question. Releasing an album a year seems to have made them a bit tired this time around. There's no stand out songs here, sure they'll grow on you the more you listen, but no classic Third Day melodies. It kind of feels like they've put all the songs that didn't cut it on their previous releases on this album. I don't have a problem that this isn't a 'worship' album it is still Christian, subtle enough to share with non-Christians, but you wouldn't really want to as there's nothing really worth shouting about. Sorry Third Day, I really really like you, but don't rest on previous successes. Strive to excel and surpass and be excellent, taking longer than a year is ok, we'll wait, I just know you can do better."
2,Big Letdown,"If you're looking for a rocking cd, this ISN'T it.I'd go with the new Mercy Me over this one. Undone flat out rocks harder than Wire."
1,Not the best,"I have Third Day's Conspiracy, Time, Come Together, Offerings. Wire is the worst of them all. This CD appears to be an attempt to cross over to mainstream as the songs/messages, I consider Christianity lite or water-downed. Many songs sound way too much alike on this CD, almost as if it is just a one song CD. I listen to Time, Come Together, Offerings frequently. I don't know when I'll desire to listen to Wire again. It'll probably just collect dust. Hope they can do better on their next CD. But I'll probably listen to samplers first before just purchasing it immediately like with the others. It's a good thing I only paid $9.95 for it."
2,I'll Pass.....,"I like Third Day for their worship songs...not for their music in which they don't even mention God. Other reviewers are saying that Third Days' older music was ""in your face"" with Jesus. The Spirit inside of me desires music that praises God out in the open not in hidden lyrics. I really started to like Third Day. Would sing out to God, ""Show me your Glory.."" I sampled portions of this ""Wire"" album and read the lyrics on the Third Day website and am not interested in buying it. The song..""I Believe""(heard it on the radio).is catchy but not enough for me to want to buy. As a saved Christian I am only desiring music that has me feeling close to God. I like Third Day and won't abandon them...I'll just listen to their old songs and wait to see if they go back to worshipping God with their music."
2,Weakest Effort,Overall their weakest effort. Also the least memorable lyrics. No need to purchase this one.
5,This is good stuff,"We are all used to Third Day giving there best and they did it again! This is one rocking album! I would say it is a mix of Time and Come Together. One of my personal favorites is the song ""Blind"" which will have you worshipping after the first line. This album is a must for any music fan that wants to rock and worship!"
5,Wired Wows!,"In a truly unique way, Third Day continues to display their depth as a group as they execute awesome rock with inspiration. One of the best bands of our generation."
5,"These guys not only know how to worship, but they know music","So Far, Third Day and Audio Adrenaline are neck-and-neck in the ""My Favorite Christian Band"" competition. I'll buy a CD from one and play nothing else for a month, then buy a CD from the other and lose another month to them...This one, however YOU read it, rocks. It may be the pinacle of their artisan-ship to this point, and more may be waiting in the wings, but this one IS IT! The doubt of ""Wire"" played against the certainty of ""I've Got a Feeling"" is pure perfection.Except for the fact that we all expect much greater things from them with their later works..."
4,"Will the tour be called ""Live Wire?""","The 3rdDay boys have never sounded better. Top notch production,song writing, and execution. Every song is a winner. Hopefully,they'll get some airplay in the mainstream..."
4,I just can't give it 3 stars.,"I would have to say MOST of the songs on here are good.But we could've done without rockstar,Billy Brown,and San Angelo.All 3 of these songs don't even hardly say anything about Jesus Christ.My favorites are:til' the day i die,come on back to me,wire,i believe,blind,you are mine,and I will hold my head up high.Unless you are a major third day freak i would get the debut,time or offerings1 and 2."
2,Best Book of the 18th Century,"After a hundred pages of categorizations and terms and concepts that repeatedly fail to meet ""Hume's challenge,"" you'll wonder why anyone is sitting around a poker table where someone called the bluff and made off with the pot three centuries ago. Students of social sciences and applied ethics, stay away at all costs. If this is on a grad school syllabus, ask the professor if you can go break rocks or polish toilets for a week instead, or just tell him he can ""borrow"" some of your research."
3,International artist's,"If you wish to have a book showing you different artist's work then you will love this book, but if you buy it as a beginner artist to aid you in your quest, do not waste your money.I bought the 'Watercolour Skies' by International artists, and that was a great book with step by step demonstrations by each artist, this was the reason I ordered this book, but was a very disappointed....don't get me wrong the book is nice to browse through....but if you are wanting it for a teaching guide...forget it!"
3,Guiness World Records 2000 Book,Fairly happy - book was a little damaged with scratches and tears etc. but needed 2000 book to add to my colection.
2,not as good as the first,"I loved ""Times Change,"" but this one disappointed me. It is uneven, hard to listen to, and none of the tracks really stand out. Ironically, the musicians on ""Intuition"" are better known and arguably superior to those featured on the first album. It just goes to show that individual talent does not necessarily make a good album. If you have his first cd, order it now. It is a classic."
5,Evolution of Energy,"I think the new CD by S.T.U.N. is incredible! Not only are they basing their songs on their outlooks of a whole lot of things; the music with the lyrics tie in perfectly, the disc doesn't have two or three hit songs and the rest are worthless (like some CDs i've bought in the bpast)..its a full on CD with hit after hit after hit. They sound so different from other artists, that's what's going to make them stand out among the rest of the 21st century songs. I suggest buying this CD whether you have seen them live, which will impact you more, or if you just like listening to coolcore music. Seeing S.T.U.N. at the Warped Tour here in SLC Utah made me realize what kind of underground music im missing. This CD is great!"
1,"Horrible album, not 1 good song","I'm glad I got this used for only $1 cause it's not worth a penny more so I don't feel too ripped off. I had heard of these guys but nothing by them but hey it was a buck so I figured I'd buy it anyways, and it's really bad. The lead singer is horrible, the music is too loud over his voice and it's not any good either. Nothing positive about this cd or this band."
2,Dissapointing,"I tried listening to the Evolution of Energy over and over, hoping to like it and pretend that I didn't waste $10... I found it boring, with repetitive guitar riffs and similar sounding songs. It's lacking in creativity and interesting melodies. The Evolution of Energy sounds like the generic and mainstream music so popular right now, and even though S.T.U.N. isn't incredibly well known it sure sounds like it. That being said, these guys have the potential to make it big. (I do like the singer's energy and voice, and that's about it.) The lyrics were really simple and I didn't think that they really made that great a statement, rather just a repetitive call for revolution, but I guess the lyrics would be okay if they had more talent musically. Just like someone else said, they had some moments that were similar to RATM, but really fell short- spare yourself from this ""PUNKROCK"" cd."
1,Made Manson Look Good,I read that S.T.U.N. were going to be opening up for Marilyn Manson on tour & picked this album up to learn more about them (and then promptly sold it). Can this even be considered music? S.T.U.N. is the highly unforunate child of the Sex Pistols & Rage Against the Machine without ANY of either band's talent. They're simply not interesting. There's a reason there are so many used copies for sale at such a low price as I would warn anyone & everyone to avoid this release. S.T.U.N. is even worse live & I've a feeling Manson simply invited them along to make himself appear more talented & interesting (which is a poor excuse to make his fans suffer through S.T.U.N.'s set).
4,If you like it fast and short...,"I never heard of this band until I saw them on tour with Coheed & Cabria and The Used a couple of months go, and I've been waiting for this release ever since. They're more punk than emo; most of there songs seem to be about revolution and anti-establisment rather than whining about their problems. I don't really care what the lyrics are though, as long as it sounds good...and this does."
5,Dracula Fans!,"This sweet, compact guide measures only 7"" x 3"", but packs a wallop in the info department! Went to Dublin last year, and out of 8 city guides I looked at, this was the ONLY one who had info on Bram Stoker (Dracula's author); his house in an historic landmark, and the author also leads you to his beautiful birth residence!"
4,"Everything you need to know, and then some!","I really found the book useful, but I wish it had a method to highlight ""must see"" things better. I was in Dublin for a very short trip and had difficulty combing through the book to figure out what I should prioritize for my limited time. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased the Ireland guide, rather than Dublin, so it would have been easier for me to pick out the key things to see. On second thought, I might not have had the great, detailed maps if I had done that, so maybe I went the right route!I've had great experiences with Lonely Planet guides in general, though I also love Let's Go. They don't have as many out there, but I buy the Let's Go version if it's available - better info for people on a budget, and lots of great ""off the beaten path"" suggestions."
3,error in description,"Please be aware there is an error in the Product Description: ""The 2 inch square hitch bar..."" It is NOT 2 inch, it is 1 1/4"". Read the 'Product Features' for accurate information. And, as the other poster commented, it is chrome, not black. Otherwise it appears to be well made."
4,A good activity book for children.,"This book is a reprint of a 1929 publication. As such, some of the construction techniques, particularly the making of glue and paste, will be ""unexpectedly practical"" for many modern readers.These kite designs work as well today as they did in 1929. Substituting modern materials like Tyvek house wrap and packing tape make these designs stronger and quite a bit easier to build.This is a good activity book for parents and children."
4,Great Themes!,"I love the themes for this movie. They are Oscar worthy, but didn't get the nomination. Eris' theme is my favorite (it's the song: Let the Games Begin). I looked for this on iTunes but it was unavailable. This would be a good website to buy the soundtrack from."
3,Gets better with each listen,"For years I thought I would never get it. Not one music store I've ever been to carried it. Then Amazon came along. After reading reviews if VI elsewhere it was a bit of a let-down but as I listened to it more and more it started to grow on me. While not the Circle Jerks best album it's certainly different with more of a hard rock/heavy metal approach like Beat Me Senseless and Love Kills, a title used by other bands around the same year. Unfortunatly a lot of the songs do suck but Status Clinger and Casualty Vampire shine through the clutter, as does I Don't; a highlight and THE loser's anthem (take notes Beck). All in all I'm glad I got it."
4,A improvement over Wonderful,"This even though while not being their best , is a much more improvement over Wonderful which also had the new lineup. ""Casualty Vampires"" is the best song on here. "" Beat Me Senseless"" , "" All Wound Up"" , and "" I Don't"" are also real good. Check out the other albums , Group Sex , Wild In The Streets , and Golden Shower Of Hits ."
5,Excelent choice on finance Monte Carlo,Clear and sound theoretical background on applied Monte Carlo for finance.
3,Badly printed,"This book looks like it was printed on a laser printer that has run out of toner. The characters are very faint, gray rather than black, and a little fuzzy. The content is more like a quickly put together course handout than a reference work. I am surprised that a firm like Springer would produce such a shoddy product."
2,Mathematically disappointing book,"Don't be fooled by the name of the Springer series where this book appeared: if you are looking for a nice list of examples and applications, then this book may be ok, but otherwise, this is not the place to look for proofs and rigorous results."
3,OK but,"This book is nice. It coverts a lot of subjects. However their explanations are not very good, from my point of view, of course. It is difficult to understand what they want to say.Moreover there is no real (i.e. code) implementation and no example with which you can test your own code you made using their procedures.However it is worth to buy it"
3,Do it yourself,"Build a simple, non-arbitrage fixed income model yourself - you'll lean more than reading a pile of books."
1,don't watch the birdie,I have taken pictures with this camera several times. Each time I attempt to download them I am told that there are no pictures in the camera. This camera was a waste of money.
5,Nothing Short of Great!,"Great Disc, Great Band. There out on tour right now. Catch them if you can!!"
4,A Cat Lover's Dream,This novel is great for a cat lover of any age. The attention to detail of what cats do and why is clever and entertaining. The love story is very well done.
2,Good first half marred by abysmal second half,"Beautifully written, interesting concept of a boy who becomes a cat. But everything after ""Price of two tickets to Glasgow"" is meandering, unfocused junk, with the ending that's as rude and sophomoric as a slap of the face.Best advice: read this book until the cats get off the ship, then quit while you're ahead."
5,SUPERB!,"I'm the author of ""Thinkertoys (A Handbook of Business Creativity),"" and ""Cracking Creativity (The Secrets of Creative Genius),"" and, generally read most of what is written about creativity on the market. This little book is superb. Though it is short, it is very well done and to the point. I recommend it highly."
5,Great Rotors! 2004 Volvo S60 T5,"It was time to swap out the pads on my S60, and I noticed that the rotors had a pretty noticeable lip on them. Though some of the contracts have changed, originally, everything on my car was from ATE (pads, fluid, calipers, etc.), so I prefer to use only ATE parts. Clearly these rotors weren't the ones that came with the car, but they are made by the same manufacturer. The addition of the wear sensor on the face (the atomic looking thing) is also a nice addition. Obviously, if you're swapping out rotors, be sure to swap out the pads at the same time and bed your brakes as well.All in all, a great product. Fit was perfect, build quality is excellent, and Amazon had a great price."
3,"Nice, though not quite what I expected.","I already own one of Amy Brown's other designs for steering wheel covers so I thought for a change of pace and something new I'd order this one. Figuring that they'd both be of the same quality, I wasn't hesitant. I was surprised when I recieved it because the graphic was not at all detailed, very blurred and not as pretty as I'd hoped. The stitching and the fabric are top quality but the graphic could be printed a lot better. All in all I'm satisfied but not thrilled."
3,"Beautiful Design, Ran small in size","I love the design. I got it onto the steering wheel, only to have the rubber portion split apart after a month, because it is just too small."
2,Beautiful but useless :(,"Like the title says, this was a beautiful piece to add to the whole Amy Brown theme I had going in my car. But unfortunately I will be buying a new steering wheel cover b/c it fell apart w/in the first week of me having it. I still don't know what happened to it, the fabric on one side just starting coming off in little black pepper chunks.I'm still bummed about it cause now I have to go buy something else, spend more money, and it'll not match the set of ""Silver Moon Fairy by Amy Brown"" stuff I got for my car. :("
2,Falling apart,I recently bought this steering wheel cover to match my seat covers. It looked great till I got it on my steering wheel and it started to fall apart. The one side has the fairy coming off and black stuff flaking off on my hand when I use it. I have never had issues with stuff I order from Amazon but this was a large disappointment.
3,Amy Brown Steering Wheel cover,"I was not happy that he fairy was blue on the sides instead of purple like the matching seat cover. The material feels cheap for the cost of this whole set but I have enjoyed it. I rather enjoy the black material feel rather than the velvety grey but that's just me. It was a challenge to get on the wheel as it doesn't stretch much. I've had it 3 months and it hasn't faded in the sun yet. Not a bad buy, but it feels cheaply made."
4,Nice product,I've had this on my steering wheel for a long time now and it's held up well. It wasn't until recently that the material started to rip and the picture started to flake off. It does a good job keeping cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
5,Amy Brown Artwork fan,"I'm a fan of Amy Brown's work, and was very pleased when I was able to purchase these accessories for my new car -they're definitely an expression of myself!"
3,sound is hot,"The CD presents a varied array of arrangements from chamber music era favorites to jazz standards and blues. In most of the tunes, one player takes the melody, followed by solos each in turn, cleverly punctuated with background riffs from the others The overall sound of this group is hot, when listening to them you can not help but keep your foot tapping. All musicians play together like they have played together for their entire lives. This is a modest CD but I would recommend it to anybody that is interested in expanding their outlook on jazz."
4,Small Train Stencils,"As others have said these are very small stencils, but it is a nice little book of stencils to produce a train theme."
2,Eh.,"Yes, the book is small. Yes, the pages are flimsy. But I think what I like least of all is that most of the trains are basically a long rectangle or a long oval with a few small wheel circles. Boring trains. The best train is the one on the cover; the rest are boring."
3,"Smaller than expected, but still cute","I bought this for my train-loving 4 year old. I assumed that it was standard drawing/stencil book size, so I ordered it as a Christmas gift. It ended up being a stocking stuffer. It is still going to be well-enjoyed."
2,Be aware,"Nowhere in the technical information does Epson state that the 'Copy' and 'Photo Print' on the ""SMART PANEL"" only work with Epson Stylus Color or Epson Photo printer. One only finds out about this shortcoming by way of a ""TIP"" in the user manual when one checks why it is not printing. We have an HP LaserJet and an HP DeskJet."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,This scanner appears to have pontential but it turns out be be a flop. Many of its advertised options only work if you own a Epson printer. This fact that it only works with other Epson products is never mentioned until you get the product home and try to use it. When it fails to work the Epson Tec support people are quick to inform you that you will have to purchase one of their printers to use many of the options. If it was more compatible it could be a outstanding scanner. My advise is not to purchase the Epson 640U scanner! I have learned to hate mine.
5,Classic British TV Series,"I think that this is one of the best British Television Series ever. Exciting plots with suspense, drama and charasmatic characters. This series had a cult following in England.I believe that The Professionals was only shown on ""On TV"" the predecessor of Direct TV or Cable. In my opinion this series is far superior to The Avengers, The Saint and many other British TV shows that have made it to A&E; and other american TV channels.I am looking forward to a United States Release."
5,"BRITISH ""DIRTY HARRY"" DUO","This wonderful, action filled series was, and is, one of the best and most original of it's kind. It was surely way before it's time. This show would be a success today in any country. The great acting and action-filled scripts deserve 5 stars !!!"
1,"To Mrs. Albert, aka J.T.","Your own agent summed it up best: ""To present yourself as a person who is dying of AIDS in a culture which has lost so many writers and voices of great meaning, to take advantage of that sympathy and empathy, is the most unfortunate part of all of this,"" Mr. Silverberg said. ""A lot of people believed they were supporting not only a good and innovative and adventurous voice, but that we were supporting a person.""No matter what you do from this point forward, no matter how good or not, no one will take you seriously. By treating your fans like tools your creative power is now officially negated."
2,"You'd be better off reading Dennis Cooper instead, go to the source","It's just not a very good book, sorry. There's nothing in SARAH that Dennis Cooper and others haven't done better. Even as a Copper pastiche it still falls way short of the mark.As for Laura Albert, this kind of writing/hoax seems to be a typical American phenomenon: girls, who can't get over the fact that they weren't born as boys. They invest a lot of energy to ""re-invent"" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of ""Anthony Godby Johnson""). Make them suffer all kinds of abuse, turn them into some weak and miserable beings so that you don't have to envy them anymore (it's therefore only logical that Jeremiah has to wear girl's clothes) - that's it, there's nothing more to say actually. People, who still believe that JT LeRoy is a 25 years old man, should maybe ask themselves why they want to believe it."
1,The absolute worst,"If you think the world is headed in the wrong direction, this book gives you a clear choice. You can buy it or promote it, and be part of the problem. Or you can stand up and be counted against the lies, the manipulation, the greed, and the fraud, and be a small part of the solution. Just say NO, but say it loud!"
1,Very Troubling Turn Of Events,"Why is Amazon removing only the bad reviews of this book? If someone doesn't like this novel...for whatever the reasons...they should have the right to voice their opinion.Anyway, I was actually going to give SARAH three stars and say it's not that bad, but it's also not that great. But now the book gets only one star from me, and that's because it's becoming increasingly obvious that Amazon is bowing to the propaganda workings of Laura Albert. Clearly, besides being downright Stalinist in her need to censor others who aren't playing by her rules, this woman has some major issues."
1,YIKES!,"This has got to be the most extreme case of literary [vital organ] envy, along with a love of male genital mutilation, I've ever read. Laura Albert must have some serious issues."
3,A wild adventure,"LeRoy's inventive story of a young boy who wants to become a lot lizard (whore of a sort) like his mother is quite worth devouring. The boy calls himself by his mother's name, Sarah, and begins working like his mother, but runs away to become a better lizard. He falls in with a wrong crowd, and is mistaken for a saint, which becomes his downfall when the deranged pimp discovers 'she' is really a 'he'. Sarah is eventually rescued by his first pimp (a real gem called Glad). LeRoy's exciting rhythms and talents with words and pacing are certain to draw the reader to continue. It's a wonderful beginning for a young writer. It's certainly one of the most memorable books of the year, but it won't make my top ten for the year. Well worth reading, don't mistake me. I just don't feel as strongly for this book as others do."
3,Don't believe the hype,"I might have enjoyed this book more if I hadn't first read all the gushing cover blurbs, written by the hot Hollywood types falling all over themselves to say nice things about LeRoy's work.I admire that at such a young age, LeRoy is able to write so well. But there was something missing; he just never goes far enough--either in his characterizations or his revelations. I'm not looking for out-and-out porn, but ""Sarah"" comes across as a naughty little fairy tale that's really not that naughty. LeRoy seems confident in HOW he writes, but not in WHAT he writes about. And the kiss of death: When it was all over, my first thought was, ""So what?""Stylistically and tone-wise, ""Sarah"" reminded me more than anything of Joe R. Lansdale's science fiction dark comedy,The Drive-In. Only it's not nearly as good.Update: Since writing this review, I've learned the truth about ""JT LeRoy."" My opinions stand."
1,"Fake, Fake, Fake...","How many books/authors are now going to come out of the woodwork in light of this whole Frey/LeRoy scandal. I've seen stories about at least two other, lesser known, authors in the last week alone. It's disturbing, actually completely unconcionable, that someone (in this case a middle-aged woman )with such and influence and personality and personal connection to the people that were reading his/her books and engaging with him/her would do something of this nature. You have to wonder about the mental sanity/stability of these people. Especially this one. It wasn't just one book as with Frey. This is a decades long saga. If you ask me this author is clearly mentally disturbed and will most likely be looked at as a case study for psychologists in the future. Stay away and hunt down something verifiable and truthful. Dave Eggers is a good start."
2,Good Idea -- Bad Execution (2 1/2 stars),"I begun reading this book with high expectations, given all the praise I'd heard given to J.T. Leroy. Unfortunately, I was let down. The book has an original enough plot, but Leroy's writing skills fail. Small annoyances aside, (he often repeats words in the same sentence when another word would've sounded much better -- [...]), the book lacks something. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but it was enough to cause me to lose interest in the story. At a short 166 pages (with large font, at that), he should've spent more time developing the other characters. When Sundae and Pie show up again at the end, you've practically forgotten who they are, due to the lack of development in the beginning of the story.This is a fresh, exciting story idea. It's a shame that Leroy (and his editor) didn't invest more time in bringing it alive."
3,Way Over-Hyped,"I wanted to believe all the hype behind this novel, but sadly the hype didn't live up to what was a fairly explotive, sensational novel. There are a few well-written and fine moments, though overall I found Sarah to be somewhat silly and immature. My hope is that the story collection is stronger, because this one barely slid in under the self-important radar."
1,yaw-nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!,"Bad book, plain & simple. The writer is even worse than the prose. Blah blah blah. Oh, and don't forget the majority of RAVE reviews this book got early on came from various personas created by the hoaxster herself. Time for a little catch up from real readers."
1,EW!,"What an extreme case of pee-pee envy, mixed up with a love of male genital mutilation. The woman who wrote this certainly has some serious issues, not the least of which deals with boundries and control."
1,Luckily it was short.,"This was a strange book and very dark. It was also a little muddled. I didn't really enjoy reading it and think the story could have been told a little better. The subject matter didn't bother me but the characters were confusing. At times, I could figure out who was whom."
2,"It reads well, but is preposterous.","I never heard of this book before reading about the scandal in the new york times. However, having since read it, I really wonder if any of the people who championed it as autobiography have ever been to a West Virginia truck stop."
1,Someone please call Child Welfare,"My lord, penis envy has been taken to new heights, as does male genitial mutilation. And this woman is raising a boy child? Oh my. This isn't about gender and identity, folks. It's about undeserved control over what someone wasn't allowed to have in the first place, and it's about taking from others who've rightful earned their success and then co-opting it as your own...which could be seen, I suppose, as a metaphor for...penis envy?"
1,NOT COOL!,"Bad form! In the last 24-hours over ten reviews of this novel were removed by Amazon, all of which were from people who didn't like this book. I find that to be a very disturbing trend. People should be allowed to dislike this book and this writer without having their opinions thrown out. If Amazon starts catering to the agenda of a hoaxster and her pals, the review system ends up being meaningless.Regardless of whether our reviews are kept or not, everyone knows by now that this is a hoax. As for Sarah, I've read better things on the back of Corn Flakes boxes."
1,What a joke...!,"If by this point you think this is a remarkable book, you either (a) are the woman who wrote it, or (b) you don't read very much. In this case it's probably both."
4,Strange and wonderful and new,"JT LeRoy reminds me of an unsung writer I admire named James Purdy. His books are full of what most discerning individuals would label diseased or degenerate charcters behaving in a manner befitting their nature. Strange, yet often wonderful writing which deserves to be celebrated for daring to present a unique vision of our world. JT LeRoy writes the same way. It's almost as if they were related in some way. I've read critic's who compare him to Carson McCullers - but they are simply all wet. Carson never wrote characters or situations at this level of absurdity. There is a constant sense of unreality in this work, which absolutely separates it from any tangible comparison to the work of Ms. McCullers. They must not have made the Purdy discovery themselves or they would surely credit him as an influence. Regardless of who may or not have influenced LeRoy, his is an original voice. ""Sarah"" is a wonderful, wild, repellent, roller coaster of a novel."
3,"Good book, not amazing though.","I picked up this book because I had seen the film the heart is decietful above all things and was moved. This, I found to be a bit weak. It jumps from scene to scene in a confusing way, alot of the time it is seriously confusing. I liked reading it, only took me a few hours, but I wasn't exactly... moved by it.I think it could have been done better, the story is compelling, it has some wonderful surreal moments, interesting imagery; especially for me the scene where Sarah and Pooh are playing with Barbie dolls.I think it is worth checking out. I am still interested enough to read The heart is decietful above all things."
1,Soylent Green,"After all these years, it turns out Soylent Green is made of people. Drats! Sure, it might be tasty, but I just can't bring myself to eat it or look at it as a tasty treat any more. Same thing goes for this book. Turns out ""Sarah"" is made of Laura Albert and not JT Leroy. I need to gag myself now."
2,a turd by any other name...,"Avoid this dud and do yourself a serious favor. For the life of me I can't imagine how someone could find something profound in this misguided faux teen-angst vision of non-reality, unless this is the first book they've ever read and they think child rape and sexual abuse is profound. I will say, however, that it is profoundly derivative in a major way: oh, look, the author just read Flanner O'Connor...oh, and that's Dennis Cooper there...oh, there's a tad of Mary Gaitskill. The only problem is that it lacks the real talent and genuine vision of those writers. In other words, it's more like The Monkees than The Beatles, just not as good as The Monkees. So avoid this worm on the hook, really. You can thank me later."
1,how to exploit the pain of others to make a success of yourself,"If anything speaks volumes about the greed and self-absorbed heart of ""crash and burn America"" it would be this scam posing as literature. More than anything though, I feel bad for those REAL children who have been abused(...), will find it very difficult now to find publishers that'll take them seriously."
1,RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you're buying SARAH now, the joke is totally on you. This gag is so over. Save your money, read something else instead. Maybe try some case studies by real hustlers, real abused children, or real writers who have the guts to stand behind their novels without playing games."
1,"sorry, this book was a disappointment","I read the blurb on JT Leroy in Vanity Fair and was very interested in reading his book. Sorry to say, the reality does not live up to the expectation. The book lacks engaging characters, a discernible plot, and any semblance of readability. I made it halfway through and that was an effort. However, the book made a strong enough impression on me to write a negative review, so perhaps that is a point in its favor.If you want ""hallucinatory"" fiction, read Burroughs (Bill). If you want inspired fantasy, read Burroughs (Edgar Rice). If you want gritty realism, read James Ellroy.Save yourself the trouble and pass this stinker by."
2,"Uh...sure, whatever.","Thanks for dropping in, Laura, and singing your own praises. Otherwise, this book isn't very good at all, regardless of who wrote it. But if you do think it's amazing, you might be needing to read a few more books."
1,OK work for a 16 year old; terrible book for the 40 year old who actually wrote it,"Knowing this is a hoax, and not the work of a 16 year old, it's just not worth it. This ""writer"", an aging, homely woman, had to dupe people into thinking she was an HIV positive youth to get this dreck published. Not recommended."
1,Let's Not Confuse Things.,"Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurd, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"
1,"Inauthentic, corny and just plain awful","Poor writing--not least due to its outrageous inauthenticity. Very like the ""Go Ask Alice"" of the third millenium: a novel purporting to be based on factual, lived experience--in actual fact, a cynical fraud. All of the words here are very, very selfconsciously 'street', preciously explicit, and come off as a third-rate pastiche of a John Irving universe as dreamed by John Rechy. in work like this, it really does matter who's doing the writing. J.T. Leroy is a middle aged woman. That's it. At your own risk, readers."
2,J.T. Leroy/Laura Albert,"J.T. Leroy wrote deeply moving, harrowing accounts of his childhood, using fiction as a way out of his painful childhood. But, unfortunately, it has been learned that J.T. Leroy isn't a real person, and was invented by somebody named Laura Albert. So...Laura Albert wrote deeply untrue, disturbing stories of a childhood that didn't exist, taking advantage of the public's sympathy for abused children and using it as a way to make herself some money. There are more than one way to prostitute a child, you know. Even if it is a child who wasn't real. Shame on you, Ms. Albert."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Concerning J.T. Leroy and the fact of him being a mean hoax played on a whole bunch of people, many deserving to be fooled but many more not deserving it, I'm reminded of a few lyrics by Pete Townshend: ""We forsake you/Gonna rape you/Let's forget you, better still."" It sucks Leroy not being real, because for a while there he was almost worth it."
3,A Harrowing Journey through Sub-America,"Uneven, yet poetically sparse, and ultimately oddly moving, Sarah (whether or not it is autobiographical at all)is a riveting tale centered on a male prostitute, trailer hookups, and even more unsetlling themes. While overall this book is powerful and JT Leroy appears to be a burgeoning, much-needed voice, the book has its minor flaws that do detract from the overall affect, but for those who want to know what may go on under the noses of rural communities, this book is a rough and glittering gem."
5,this is no zero!,"It's a quick and interesting read... fun to read out loud. There are a lot of play on words that made me take a second or third look!Here is a small excerpt from the book:bare feet runacrossa hot sandy beachcrossing overto the edgea shorelinereleasecool waterwave peaksmimic the mountainsendlessdrive throughbare feet run across the beachto the waterFor more information, go to Paul's website: www.notagain.org"
5,Brooks and Dunn record another hit album!,"I have always been a Brooks and Dunn fan. I bought this album for ""Red Dirt Road"", hoping that the other songs would be great and they are! This album has a nice combination of fast and slow songs. Kix and Ronnie have a knack for keeping thier original country-rock sound while continuing to move forward with new styles. I admire them for not becoming ""sell-outs"" and staying cool and true to country music. This is one of the best country cd's I've bought in a while. I'm always skeptical of buying a cd after hearing only one song, but Brooks and Dunn always deliver the best so I'm glad I purchased thier latest masterpiece! My personal favorite on this album is ""That's What She Gets for Loving Me."" I think every woman can appreciate this song! Great job, boys!"
1,Product,"After reading reviews of this album and enjoying ""Steers And Stripes"" I bot this album with much anticipation. It is terrible. Tired, hackneyed and totally lacking any inspiration it can only be called product. I was so incensed and after trying to like it after several listens, I gave it away."
2,Ho-Hum,"First of all, what happened to the COUNTRY in ""Country Music?""This CD is definately not country. It is also not typical of what B&D is known for. A couple of the songs are OK, but for the most part, the CD seems uninspired. I lent it to another country music fan to listen to, and he felt as I did. If you are looking for a good B&D CD to purchase, you would be better off with almost any of the others than you would be with this one. I hope their next release takes them back to what they used to be. Maybe then they'll sing country again."
3,Ehh its ok,"I love Brooks and Dunn so I rushed out to buy their new cd today. Its way different than any of their other cds. For example, in ""Holy War"" there's a choir in it. Uhh Brooks and Dunn kinda go onto a new path with this cd. ""Red Dirt Road"" is probably the best song on this cd, even though I do like ""That's What She Gets For Loving Me"" and ""Feels Good Don't It."" Maybe this cd will grow on me but I'm not too impressed right now."
2,disappointing,I love Ronnie Dunn's voice so I was disappointed in Kix's singing. I love Kix to play he is fabulous. I like a couple of the song's like the title but overall not worth the money.
1,Put them in jail,"So this is a country album? Let me see here, the first song sounds like a song they released a few years ago about Little Miss Honky Tonk. Then the 5th song sounds like every other ballad they have ever released. This is pathetic just like their careers. Singing about boot-scootin, beer drinking just cutting a shine ya'll. Don't ever call these guys old school. Old school is Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson etc.. How much more of this garbage are people going to buy? There is nothing that even comes close to being original here. They also started the, ""honky tonkin"" revolution with their first album which shot the legends of country right in the heart. Put them in jail, take away their right to record POP music and make them listen to Bill Monroe or Hank Williams for a few months."
1,Don't waste your money,"THis cd is a huge let down. Don't waste your money on red dirt road. Every song on the cd sounds the same and it is hardly country at all. Futhermore, it is not even worth the risk of downloading...."
5,Another great hit album for Ronnie and Kix,"Red Dirt Road has something for everyone. A little blues, a little rock and a little country. Ronnie and Kix can sing them all. They guys have written most of these songs and they are very good and true Brooks and Dunn Songs. I totally recommend this album."
5,A tool for artist looking at Francis Bacon,"This book is an essential tool to better understand the process in which Francis Bacon produced his master works. As an artist, this book demystifies the painter while testifying his genius."
4,Hot,Used for 2 winters before selling the car. Worked like expected with much better starts on those cold (avg. temps. in the teens) mornings.
5,got it through the first winter,"doesn't look very big, but put one on my tractor and one on the wife's 85 mercedes diesel. worked really good, when it was really cold. i'm sure it'll add engine life, because i mounted it to the oil pan, so i can preheat the oil before cranking. if you have bad glow plugs or like on my old diesel tractor, no glow plugs, then get ya one. so far i'm liking mine"
4,Not grounded plug,"This product does not have a three prong grounded plug. Otherwise, it sticks and gets hot and does what I wanted it to do. I have these on two small import cars, I would use a higher wattage model for a larger engine."
5,hot product!!!,"This works great I set it on a timer for 3 hours before I go to work, I go out my vw tdi cranks like it is summertime when its actually down to 2degrees outside !"
1,Watch out!,"I took it out of the package and decided to test it before using it on my motor - I also noticed that the cord plug wasn't gounded.I plugged it in and it started to curl, smoke everywhere, and I unplugged it so it wouldn't meltIt is not ""thermostatically controlled"" - it just turns on when you plug it in.Worthless and dangerous - I was going to use this as a block heater for my boat engine - I'm glad I didn'tDon't waste your money on this thing."
1,Program listings,"Although the original FORTRAN77 version of Numerical Recipes is highly acclaimed (and rightfully so, it is really worth every buck) I do not recommend this FORTRAN90 book. I was very disappointed when I received it. A huge part of the book only contains F90 program listings for the same routines that are derived and discussed in detail in Volume I (F77). The two new introductory chapters make it not worth buying the book. Instead, get the Numerical Recipes CD-ROM which includes the source code for C, F77, F90 and other languages and maybe a good introductory or reference book on F90.(The review of ""oblinqued"" down below is obviously referring to the original book as the F90 book was not available in 1991)."
3,Numerical recipes in f90 volume 2,This IS NOT a standalone book. It can be read ONLY with NR f77 (2. Ed. also titled Volume I). The discussions on the algorithms given there are not repeated here. The few new recipes (eg on random numbers using a lot of f90) are explained in the excellent style one has come to expect of the authors. However to make sense out of the book you must have both this and the volume 1 open at the corresponding pages. This makes it inconvenient to use. For this reason it was something of a disappointment.The cleanliness of the code in the recipes (as expected from the authors other recipe books) and the introductory chapters on f90 and parallelization still make the book worhtwhile.I think I would have given the book more stars if my expectations (based on previous version) were not so high.
2,save your Money,"Firt Off, You get what you order! There is no problem with the item or the description. HOWEVER, this is not a great deal. We paid around $8.00 including shipping for half a pound of yarn remenants. This is not some massive quantity of yarn, you get about one skein of yarn. You can buy a one pound super save for less. Not wanting to bad mouth the item, just wanting other to be aware of what they are buying."
5,I have 2 of them! Excellent,Excellent display for the money - I liked my first one so much I bought a second one. Was comparale to my Dell 1907FP monitor.Pros:Come with VGA and DVI cablesFast response - no ghostingTilt adjustmentClear and bright textCons:No pivot
2,No bargain,"I just returned one, even though I paid very little for it. It might be good for images or movies, but the clarity of text was terrible."
5,Additional Information,"These discs are ""region 1"" and will play on your DVD player. Mother & Son, a product of Australian television, is quite possibly one of the best sit-coms ever made."
5,Great comedy,"Great characters and story lines. If you are a fan of British comedies you will love this series from Australia. We especially loved the episode entitled ""The Funeral"". I can't wait to get the rest of the series."
2,Disappointed,"This one just doesn't make it. The premise is terrific, but this thing never really takes off or lives up to the expectation."
2,2 stars only because I support Dave....,"I think Dave Chappelle is a genius, really ground-breaking, intelligent commentary on society at large and the African-American experience.I hope to God Dave is getting something positive from this.Watching this dvd just made me sad. I could not enjoy the sketches fully (although, as stated by others the Cribs and Tupac skits work on their own and are funny). Many of the skits were missing Dave's lead-in and seemed disjointed and confusing at times.Dave really makes the show - while Donnell and Charlie are funny respectively, it gave me a guilty feeling watching it - it's not their show. It wasn't right, it seemed really forced - not natural and genuine like Dave is. I don't think I could watch this dvd more than once.Watch the first two seasons and the block party dvd, they're excellent.I wish Dave well - I think he made the right choice to leave."
2,"I have to agree, season 3 was better unreleased","There are a few chukles here and there but its really sad that the Chapelle show legacy will be forever tainted, not w/ the cancellation of season 3, but by the rushed release of these episodes, without Dave MCing.What Donelle and Charlie Murphy fail to understand is that while yes they are funny comedians, Chapelle brought out their best. Without Dave's sanctioning, these DVDs and episodes have aired. As anyone who has tried to watch one understands, its just not that good. These are clearly an unfinished product and Charlie/Donelle do not do a good job setting up sketches, probably because they didn't write most of them and Chapelle did not edit any of them."
3,so-so from a great comic,"i loved this show when it first came out as did just about everyone that has seen it. that was years ago. now we have this. i wasn't entirely disappointed with this dvd, only it felt a little empty. i think charlie murphy is funny along with the other guy, but it just didn't seem right that they hosted these episodes. aside from that, some of the skits were hillarious while others bordered on tedium.after watching some of the older episodes, i realized these were just about the same as the rest of the skits, it is only a little too late for them to be released. i fully understand why David left when he did. he wanted to be remembered as one of the funniest comics out there who only did the show for the love of it, not for the money.check this dvd out only if you were like me and couldn't wait to see something new from him. if not then just watch it on comedy central. it is nice having it uncensored so if you must, just rent it."
2,Patchwork DVD,"That Chappelle's Show will be regarded as one of the funniest ever seems beyond dispute. Exceedingly sad that Comedy Central elected to pick the bones of the carcass clean by slapping together this DVD. Dave, the fans, and the show itself deserved better. Goodbye Chappelle's Show - and thanks for 2 incredibly funny seasons."
1,Dave was right.... don't buy this,"I bought this cause I loved Chappelle's Show and my curiousity beat out my respect for Dave as an artist. That was a mistake. The only good reason for viewing this is that if you watch it, there will be no doubt in your mind that Dave's decision to drop out of the show was the right one."
1,Chapellle didnt want to do these for a reason...,"They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone.Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though."
3,incomplete but there was potential,"This could have one of the best seasons. People have got to understand that the season wasn't finished and they had to scrap what they had together to fill a show. Some of the scenes could have been edited better hey, I ain't mad because its still funnier than 80% of what's on TV now."
4,"LOST OR NOT, ITS STILL GREAT!","STOP BITCHING ABOUT IT, GREAT COLLECTED TRASH MIX, CAST DID GOOD WORK, SURE ITS NOT THAT GOOD BUT AT LEAST SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHIN! TOTAL NUMBER OF EPISODES IN CHAPPELLE'S SHOW IS NOT 33 BUT 32, THE MUSIC JUMP OFF IS BS WASTE, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS SPECIAL EPISODE, ALSO THE BEST OF DAVE HAS 2 SHOWS SO EACH SEASON HAS 13 SHOWS + BEST OF IS 15 SHOWS!"
4,What a shame..end of a great show,"The swan song to one of the funniest shows ever on TV. The episodes themselves only had a few funny sketches in them. The Tupac, Pixie, and Puff Daddy sketches were hilarious. The funniest part of this DVD are the extras. There is a hilarious unaired sketch of Daddy Day Care 2 with Charlie Murphy. Donnell ""Ashy Larry"" Rawlings and Charlie give hilarious commentary on every episode. There is a ""Making of Season 3"" featurette that is very funny where they debate the Pixie sketch. Also on this DVD, the banjo player in the Pixie sketch (played by Mos Def) is edited out. The musical performances are John Legend ""Ordinary People"" and Dead Prez ""Hip Hop"". Its a shame this show ended on a bad note. I guess it was too far ahead of its time, like the Richard Pryor TV show."
1,goodbye&thank goodness,this horrible show was a mess from the word jump&should have never made it this long. I never found anything funny about the show. all Dave Chappelle did was bite Snoop Dogg's concept&Show. Charlie Murphy was a one trick pony and not funny either. I never felt the music on the show either. the show was a Choke job&a bad idea period. glad it's gone.
4,dave chapelle is always good,"the DVD quality is quite good.but there are only basically 3 episodes on this DVD...depending on how big of a Dave Chapelle fan you are, you need to decide whether it is worth the price."
3,Came a little short,"Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE dave chappelle fan. But I found that the lost eps are not as great as the first 2 seasons of his shows. Although I enjoyed it, I would recommend that you just wait for it to show on tv."
4,Gift for My brother,"Chappelle's Show- The Lost Episodes was a gift for my brother. I already owned the DVD. Not as good as season one or two, but still pretty funny. My brother thought so too."
3,BLAH,"Like others have said this should have stayed lost. Im glad I borrowed it and didn't waste money on purchasing it. The only skit that I found to be funny was the ""New Tupac Song"" ""I wrote this a long time agooo back in 94"" lol that one had me going. The pixie skit was horrid. It made no sense what so ever. The racial draft from season 2 I believe was 1000x better. Overall I'd recommend you skip this one or if you REALLY really want to see it, borrow it or rent it from the video store. Its not worth $15."
1,"Skip this, watch the Tupac skit on YouTube","The only good skit from these three episodes was the Tupac skit. That's prolly one of the best skits -ever- actually. But the rest of the skits suck.Big disappointment with these episodes. And I originally thought there were supposed to be 4? Who knows.. but buy the first two seasons, which are priceless comedy."
2,Chapelle Show minus Chapelle,"I gave this DVD a chance being a big fan of not only the show but Dave Chapelle in general. The skits on this disk were only moderately funny and without an intro by Dave they were just dissapointing. I could see buying this DVD to complete a collection, but for entertainment value it falls way short of the mark.The skit about MTV cribs was indeed funny but not worth buying the disk for. I hope to see Dave do some more standup. He's is definately one of the funniest men of our time."
1,Agree with should have stayed lost,"I agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good. OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying. I love Charlie Murphy and the Ashy guy and I think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny. Dave, come back to TV!"
2,"Worth renting, not owning","It just doesn't work that well. These skits are so obviously the C- versions or ""nevermind"" sketches that they never would have made it on the air if they were surrounded by the A+ material of previous seasons. These episodes admittedly house several giggle-able moments and even some great stuff (I, too, very much enjoy the Tupac song), but the quality is under par, far under what one would expect even from an unfinished project like this one. I recommend seeing them, just because they're funny enough to be worth the time to watch them, but also because it does provide some closure for those of us who have been attached to Chappelle's Show at the hip for a couple of years."
2,Hate to say it......,"I know Dave Chappell didn't want the ""It wasn't as good as the first 2 seasons"" review. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything else that would describe The Lost Episodes. Like many of the review below, the song ""I Wrote the song a long time ago"" by Tupac was timeless. However, that episode is pretty much where the laughter stopped for me. The entire season didn't have me rolling on the floor pounding my fist. Compared to his previous work, the Lost Episodes didn't meet the bar. It really did disappoint me, because season 1 & 2 show just how funny this man can be."
2,Not so great,"Used to watch the Chapelle show years ago... and then I enjoyed it. Now I dont, Not sure if it is just this purchase, or if I changed, but no where near as funny as I remember."
5,I LOVE DAVE CHAPPELLE!,I purchased the 2 1/2 seasons of DVDs because I miss Dave's weekly show on Comedy Central. I really loved the show and miss it! This cat is so very funny! I wish he was my man!
3,I just bought it to complete the series,"There is some good stuff in ""Season 3."" The Tupac Sketch is one of the best from any season. There are a lot of misses on it too.I feel bad for buying this, because I know Chappelle didn't want it released. I just needed to own all 3 seasons of one of my favorite all-time shows."
4,It just doesn't feel quite right,"It's still Chappelle's Show, so the comedy is there, but I felt a little bad with the way it was presented. Without Chappelle introducing the sketches, it just isn't the same. And they create the atmosphere that Chappelle didn't want the audience to see these episodes which was a little off-putting. However, the sketches are still standard Chappelle and at least we get to see what they had of season 3, instead of just dropping it."
4,The Usual Dave Chappelle at his funniest.,"If you like intelligent and outrageous comedy, this is it!Dave Chappelle's no holds barred comedy hit its apex in this production.The additional cast of Charles Murhpy and others offer a variety of talents and side splitting humor, and some of these are for Adults Only!"
5,John Wayne: Ultimate Collection 25 Movies - Collectible Tin,This item was bought for an AVID JOHN WAYNE MOVIE BUFF! He was very very pleased to receive this collectible set of movies and loved that it was in a Collectible Tin box. Very pleased with the speedy delivery! Excellent Service!
5,So cute!,"Great set! Was a little disappointed when I first opened the box, but it turned out to look and feel great. It's cute and neutral. The animals look adorable and the colors are perfect for boy or girl."
4,Quick Change but no arm movement!,"Please not this figure has no joints in it elbows. Therefore its not very articulated, however the legs move alot ( bends at the knees). It a good if your going to be a collector other than that leave this to for the under 5's or Die-Hard Spiderman fans!"
2,Doesn't quite click,"Especially after seeing the background feature on the DVD, one has to admire the effort that was put into finding great locations and making the sets, costumes, and ships authentic. But it all seems a waste, as the film never gets you to the point of believing in any of it. It's not that it's a tall tale; we don't mind that as long as we can get swept up in it, but this just doesn't happen. It occurred to me, at about the point that Tony Curtis ran up the castle stairs to confront the evil king, that I might have been watching The Princess Bride (""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya""), except that The Vikings, despite taking itself seriously, doesn't succeed half so well in making you care about the characters or the plot. The battle scenes are also incredibly weak. It seems fitting that in the final funeral scene, a good number of the fire arrows fall laughably short of their target."
3,The Vikings,It was just what i expected it to be...large scale sets and great actors but with crappy lines. I enjoyed it very much but I knew what to expect
2,It came with the wrong region.You should have informed me that it can't be used in Norway.,It came with the wrong region.You should have informed me that it can't be used in Norway.It came with the wrong region.You should have informed me that it can't be used in Norway.
3,"Great concept , bizarre casting","A great film about the explosion that took place at the end of the first Millenium when the Norsemen overran an unsuspecting world has yet to be made . ""The Vikings"" comes close but is hampered by a script that doesn't quit work and choices like Tony Curtis that can't be justified ."
4,Great movie still!!,"The Vikings is a classic. I saw it when it first came out and so many of the scenes were still in my mind 50 years later. So I ordered this dvd and watched it with my wife and stepdaughter. It was still great. For that time frame and all, it was terrific. Kirk and Tony at their best."
5,Old fashioned buckle&swash with a great musical score,"The kind of exciting adventure movie they dont make any more, full of enjoyable hokum and happily hammy performances. Plus Kirk Douglas gets his eye plucked out by a bird, or something. Note the raptuous score by the greatly underrated Italian composer Mario Nascimbene -- stay tuned past the ending & you'll hear a reprise of it under the animated closing credits. A grand gory splashy romp."
4,Very authentic Viking movie. DVD transfer excellent.,"What surprized me most about this movie on DVD was the quality of the video. It feels more like a contemporary film rather than one made in 1958 - the colors are vibrant, the images crisp and the panoramic shots beautiful. The other fascinating aspect of this movie is it's authenticity which you will learn from director Fleisher's special feature narrative. The Viking ships were authentically reproduced right down to the smallest detail and the picture is shot on location in the Norwegian fjords. The ""Running of the oars"" (which Kirk performs himself) and the final sword fight are a treat to watch. The movie has violent action without being gory. It doesn't have the epic feel and melodrama of Spartacus (which came two years later) but that makes it all the more convincing."
3,Good old fashion entertainment!,If you like old movies you'll love this one! An Ernest Borgnine classic. Content ahead of its time.
3,"It's a movie, not Cinema","For all it's flaws an entertaining film. Loosley based on the story of Ragnar Lothbrok, it was this film which actually kindled an interest in me of the real Vikings. If you are looking for a history lesson, go to the History Channel or buy one of the several excellent books available here at Amazon. However, if you are looking for pure escapist swashbuckling entertainment then get this film. So don't use this as a reference for your term paper, but get this film, a couple of snacks and escape the real world for a little while (for that alone maybe I should give it 4 stars)."
4,Spectacular Adventure,""" The Vikings"" is a well made old fashion adventure movie in every sense of the word- smart script, solid direction by Richard Fleisher, breath taking photography (this is a must see in letterboxed DVD) and Douglas, Curtis and Leigh in the movie star glory . The film is action packed, realistically bloody and surprisingly sexy."
4,"Lots of Fun, not lots of plot.","This is a movie that is a pleasure to see. Watching this film for the first time in years (and the DVD for the first time ever) I find myself comparing it to the latest star wars movie....Here we see great performances (particularly Ernest Borgnine then again I can't think of any role he didn't shine in.)not much of a plot and a Viking village built actually in Norway. We see Vikings at their drunken best and worst. We see comedy, (""Mine isn't too tight."") we see action, we see wild eyed witches with hair blowing in the wind. What is there not to like?The only disapointment I had was my own fault. It always seemed the picture was missing a scene or two, (particularly when Curtis first gets to England) I always figured the scenes were cut to fit into the TV's running time. Guess not.Much like the Crimson pirate, don't spend a lot of time thinking about this picture. Just watch and enjoy it. You'll be hard pressed not to."
1,Trash all the way through,"Can I give this book negative stars? This is NOT the definitive biography of Buddy Holly. This book is in the ""Goldman tradition"" of trashing the lives of deceased celebrities. Amburn misquoted and distorted what other people told him, and probably also made up some of it.THE definitive biography of Buddy Holly is ""Remembering Buddy"" by John Goldrosen & John Beecher. Another bio that is not too bad is ""Rave On"" by Philip Norman. As for what happened during the Last Tour, read ""The Day the Music Died"" by Larry Lehmer. If you can get a hold of it, I also recommend the 5 part series ""Buddy Holly Day by Day"" by Bill Griggs who is the expert on Buddy Holly; go to ""rockin50s.com"" to see about ordering it but please be patient about getting the series as Bill has been having major health problems."
2,It's a Crock,"Buddy did not shoot the pilot. Official documentation shows that the gun was missing a bullet, but that was due to the fact that after the snow in the cornfield melted away that the farmer who owned the land found the gun and then fired off a shot to see if it still worked (to his own admission). This is also how the rumor got started. No foul play here. End of story."
5,3 Michelin stars for this delectable Brit-com,"Serious profession, indeed.Gareth Blackstock (Lenny Henry) is the best at what he does, and what he does is run the kitchen of Oxford's fictional Le Chateau Anglais. Gareth is overbearing, rude, pompous, and prone to disparaging outbursts aimed at his long-suffering kitchen staff, but underneath Gareth's brusque exterior lies a (reluctantly) sympathetic boss.The series high-point arrives with the episode 'Rice and Peas' (season 1, episode 6) when Gareth's mercurial father (played by Jamaican legend Oliver Samuels) swoops in to steal the show and doesn't relinquish the reins until the episode's closing credits.A word to the wise: season 3 sees the program turn into a studio sitcom, and even the talented Mr. Henry can't save it from run of the mill rote."
5,Simple stress relief tip? Watch (Lenny Henry) Chef!,"Yes,it took us sometime to realize how funny and smart this series is.Its fast and very sophisticated(so put the subtiltles on).Once you get into it, you are hooked.Our family can watch it again and again, just like Seinfeld and Vicar of Dibley.BRILLIANT."
2,"Too Much Shouting, Hard to Understand","""Chef- Season 1"" is a British comedy. Overall it has the same theme as many of American cooking competitions. The Chef in charge of incompetent underlings shouts and slams down dishes and pans. If you like to laugh at striving cooks being humiliated it may appeal to you. There are some quieter comedy moments, but overall it is just offensive to the senses."
1,Terrible,"I purchased the Chef based on the reviews that I read. None of the reviews included ""canned laughter"" and had I known that, it would not have been a program I would have watched or a DVD that I would have bought. This is an AWFUL show! The actors are corny and in need of lessons, but if you enjoy a program with canned laughter, this is the show for you. We love the BBC shows and have many of them but this was a real dud."
5,Yet another big hit from Bone,"This is one of Bones best songs....its from their album, The Art Of War, a double cd. Buy this song now, and buy EVERYTHING from bone cuz their UNTOUCHABLE.....this song in particular has very positive lyrics."
5,Very Useful Aid to These Epistles,"Early church expert Kelly shares his well researched thoughts of the exegesis on these three epistles.What I find the strength and usefulness of this effort is his thorough word study, which doesn't ever hardly answer the application question I have about a text, but does provide the salient word thoughts which then easily flow into the homiletical application."
4,Best of Tim Buckley,"Ah, the sweet sound of Tim Buckley. I had a couple of his early albums on vinyl way back when. Long gone of course. I had picked up a copy of his Greeting From L.A. on CD but still was missing his more familiar (to me) first two albums. This disc has several of those tunes as well as some other songs I had never heard, all very good. Too bad he left us so soon. Some of these songs are very pertinent today. Highly recommended, but I still will have to find those first two releases to fill the missing pieces."
5,Well worth the hunt,"This book is packed with beautifully reproduced drawings, ranging from small vignettes to full page illustrations. J.C. Coll's exhuberant pen and ink work is not matched by any renderer. It is fluid and precise with a variety of textures that clearly reflect his mastery of the medium, drawing illustrations for genres ranging adventure to occult to parlor mystery murders. The introductions from Nick Meglin and Gary Gianni express professional admiration as well appreciation for the medium that is too often overlooked, that of the pure art of drawing. Coll is considered by those who draw to be the man look for. His work is reflected in many artists from Fawcette to Frazetta and hopefully will inspire another generation of artists to come."
4,still going strong after twenty-five years,"Our family enjoys several meals every month selected from Shirleigh's collection of delicious, easy to fix recipes.Our all time favorite is her unique method of preparing Buffalo Chicken Wings. We have had these hundreds of times since her cookbook was first published and never tire of their spicy, but not overpowering, taste.I'd recommend her book just for this recipe alone."
2,Doesn't live up to its title,"This book purports to be an examination of the symbols and foreshadowings in the book of Genesis from the Bible. It falls short of the promise. Instead of getting an exhaustive and rational look at how this first book of the Bible sets the symbollic stage for the succeeding books, it's a list of types with little or no attempt to explain them through the lens of culture, history or Biblical symbolism. It takes an exciting subject and makes it into a shallowly-rendered cure for insomnia with as much power as a worn out battery. Sorry, I'd like to have loved this book, but there just wasn't much substance."
4,"IRS looks great, accessories not so much","The headscan for this figure looks just like the character. His outfit looks sharp and his muscles aren't too cartoonish like on most Jakks WWE figures.His accessories are what cost this figure a star. His briefcase's handle was so thin it broke off the first time I tried fitting it into his hand. The glasses look great, but they won't stay on his head properly even if you lay him down on his back and use gravity. They're basically useless.In the end, though, this is a great representation of a gimmick that many mid-90s fans of Money Inc. will appreciate."
4,A good story that will inspire others facing cancer,"A feisty survivor story? Yes. A good read? Definitely. But the book is more than that. Landro offers her story as evidence of the importance of charting one's own destiny in a health crisis.""The key to survival is taking control, learning everything you can about your treatment, making informed decisions and being prepared to fight for the right care, the right doctors and, in the end, for your own life,"" she writes. ""Had I not done this, I might not be alive today.""The result is a well-written book that sets forth a guide for others facing the same frightening, bewildering options she faced.The book is also a testament to Landro's commitment to helping others through supporting research. She donated her book advance and her portion of the proceeds from sales to cancer research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center where she was treated."
4,"Good book for serious, advanced player",First the book did not appear as it does in the picture. Plain blue binding. A great deal of information from one of the famous flute teachers.
1,Waste of Time,"I had fairly low expectations when I bought this dvd. This movie had no plot what so ever and every scene was the same; with a few shower scenes to waste time. A woman comes home and has tepid sex with her husband/boyfriend and then slices him and drinks his blood. The next scene he goes, has sex and drinks another womans blood. Next scene, she goes and has sex and drinks the blood of another woman. You see each person for two scenes each, then never hear from them again. I love low budget horror films and vampires films are a favorite but this was never entertaining in the least. If all you want is nudity you might find something to like about this piece of garbage. Otherwisw, steer clear."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Admission of your sins after you've been caught, is not a sign of integrity. Furthermore, he went on to defraud and deceive thousands of people. He simply learned how to be a better crook.ICR was a complete scam and Bernie was its founder. Which he claims to have thought up while serving eight years in club Fed. He had to go to jail to learn how to be a criminal? Or will that be his next excuse? A fish rots from the head down.Plenty of people do redeem themselves after prison. However, Bernies last scam shows he is nothing but self serving. Which is what this book is about ... serving Bernies ego!"
3,small world,"I came across this book by ""mistake"". I haven't read it yet, but I remember years of working out with Bernadino at a gym in Michigan. My fiance at the time ended up working for him and was known as his ""twin"". Luckily he got out when things started to look shady. I have to say Bernadino and Abood were always very nice. Look forward to reading this book!"
5,Re-phased in the Cerebellum,"Mars Volta restore to life the best of the dark forces of seventies prog-rock in a ridiculously silly and utterly fantastic, overblown album that will come to be appreciated for its genius before too long (reviewers below are already there). The Guardian says it conjours up images of men in cloaks and small-scale models of stonehenge, which it does, but even as they hovers in Spinal Tap country, Mars Volta do for music what the Beastie Boys did for Mullets. This album changes everything!"
3,Ambient noises and loud guitars,"Wow, this is one not for the masses, but for the guy who likes the wierd prog rock. Definately loud and fast, but also many breaks for ambient noises and strange sounds, I mean that in the best way possible. From the get go, this Cd establishes a sense of wondering, ""Now I'm Lost"". While Cedric Zavala's incredible voice soars up and down. This alblum is good and its cheap. If something is good and cheap, you should check it out."
5,REFRESHING,"This CD, that I found by mistake, has been my most played Cd for a year or more now. It is an incredible and refreshing CD. Intelligent lyrics, brilliant music! I can not get enough of it.I have since investigated, and have been totally intrigued by the history of the band. Bands and CDs like this need more exposure to the masses. From start to finish it is strong. I have not found any song on this CD to be weak. I am highly anticipating the release of their forthecoming CD, ""Francis, the Talking Mute"""
5,Best Band Ever,Omar and Cedric are the most unbeliveable musicians that have ever lived. Some people say the lyrics make no sense. They do make total sense. That is what is so great about it. You have to think about it more then just hear the same old crap. Also it is more intelligent then just writing random tracks and putting them on an album. The entire album tells a story of a mans life.Buy this album and their newer one Frances the Mute or you will wiss out on the greatest album of all time.
4,Alternative Acid Rock ??,"When I first listened to this I knew it was different - not like anything you'd hear on the radio - definitely not like any of the popular bands - a very unique sound - kind of like being in a mosh pit - your constantly being bombarded with different musical styles and sounds - one minute calm and surrealistic, the next it's loud and pounding you ears and senses. Give this one a try . . ."
2,I don't get it!,"I did like the spacey interludes between songs and the general feel of the album, however the core music did nothing for me at all."
5,"This will be The Mars Volta's ""Dark Side of the Moon""","I think the title says it all, people. I had totally given up on major label music until I heard this album. These guys are progressive with a bit of a punk and metal edge. It is kind of like listening to Rush with a soul. If you like Pink Floyd, ELP, Yes, King Crimson, Radiohead, et al, then you need this album. I've had it for two weeks now, and haven't been able to let myself listen to anything else. Yes, it is that good."
3,One of my favorite albums,I love this album. I had it a long time ago before someone stole it from my CD collection a while back. Finally got around to buying it again and I'm glad I did. One of the tracks skips a bit.. but otherwise the disc is in good condition.
1,save your money,"spend your money elsewhere, or if you must, buy RUSH, cuz that is what these guys sound like"
4,Power chords and daring vocals,"When, and only when you are prepared to listen to an album in its entirety should you spin ""De-loused in the Comatorium."" Anything less than a complete listen is an injustice to the Mars Volta.While listeners may be excited to see tracks ranging over the seven minute mark, and even beyond 12 minutes, portions do drag nearly 5 minutes to fill out those times.If you can wait for the power chords the album is an interesting experiment that could challenge Radiohead soundscapes in a different genre."
4,is this pink floyd......oh wait its not,i do not have anything against them but their sound just sounds and looks like a pink floyd album that was never released. you can clearly see that they got their inspiration from 70's psyc rock. but all in all the record in not half bad i sugest you pick it up if you are a floyd fan this is a great edition to any collection
5,Very Very Very Good Album,"This is the first time I've listened to anything remotely related to Mars Volta. I've never heard of At the Drive In or any other projects that they've been involved with. My brother recommended this CD, and the first time I felt so-so about the disc. Now, It's up there with my favorite of all time discs. TMV have definitely pushed the envelope and it's great to hear bands do that during a bad period of rock music. Thank God for The Mars Volta"
5,WOWSA,I'd have to say this is the best cd I have bought in a long time- the music is not repetitive and there are so many things to hear... And the lead singer? WOW!!Truly ingenius music.
4,Amazing.... truly mesmerizing,"seriously, i've listened to this album, in it's entirety, at least five times in the last day and i'm still intrigued. i don't even completely understand it yet, but i love it.from what i have heard, it's a concept album about a man (based on their childhood friend Julio Venegas) who goes into a coma, and the album takes place in the facets of that man's mind. the concept is a little overblown, but the music itself is incredible. It manages to be harsh, melodical, beautiful, stunning, dark, and enlightening all at once. I was only a mild fan of ATDI and i like sparta a little, but this is definately better (at least for my tastes).Considering how incredible it is, along with the fact that it is available for a decent price (i got my copy for ten bucks), this would be a worthy purchase for any fan of this type of music (although ""this type of music"" can't specifically be identified)."
2,Progressive?,"Progressive? Hardly. There's absolutely nothing new on this album. Essentially, this sounds just like At The Drive In except the songs (and song titles) are longer. Oh, and totally unemotional too. I forgot that part. At The Drive In always sounded remarkably ferocious and physical...you know, like a BAND should. The Mars Volta don't sound like a band, they sound like a science experiment. Now, that could be cool if this album was truly experimental or if its chilliness served some greater musical purpose, but really, the Mars Volta strive for emotion and fail miserably here. This gets two stars cus that song ""Inertiatic Esp"" is still pretty cool and no matter how boring this album is, it's not as boring as the other post-At The Drive In band Sparta. All in all, I guess this album means well and gets points for trying, but I'll just stick to ""Relationship Of Command,"" thank you very much."
1,"good title, laughable rock",i read all the reviews for this album and then decided to buy. i regret that decision now. this is not pschedelic. it is mini-truck metal. buyer beware.
2,I dont know about this music!!!!,"First of all, I came here to listen to this because some other reviewer said this is way better than u2. WEll here i am listenin to these people, and i think to myself, sometimes the song can be great, the lyrics can be the best, but one thing that really kills it, that is the voice. I heard the singers voice, and that guy sucks, talk about me singing better than that. The lyrics might be good, but come on, good music starts with the voice, thats where all the origins come from, instrumental and voice, not lyrical, I can write poems just as good as these guys, but my voice is not better than bono's or martins' people please!!! distinguish what is good music and good lyrics!!!Peace"
1,What?!?!?!,I've listned to this album and theres absolutely nothing special about it whatever. At times the album gets a little more progreessive in the occasional song but besides thoses rare moments this cd is horrible! I highly recommend you do not buy this cd. I've heard this cd called progressive metal and hard rock. What what are you people smoking this is like space emo crap!!!!! 0 STARS
4,De-Loused in the Comatorium,This is very experimental music of rock and pop all mixed in the lead singer sounds like Daniel Beddingfield his voice is not all that annoying wich in this case is a plusLyrics 7/10 Production 7/10 Music 10/10 Style 7/10 Voice 8/10Overall 39/50 This album actually gets 4 stars good job
3,"Kinda of repetitive in a way, but still good","I love and will always love At The Drive In, the best. They had something going that no one could even come close to. Go out and buy this cd if you are a fan, it great. It seems to me that at some point their(MARS VOLTA) new sound was ground breaking in there EP, but in their new album it seems to repetetive, to me, with all the same distortion, track to track. Beleive me i love this way better than SPARTA but its lacking something, I dont know what. Maybe its the energy i get from listning to ATDI records that pumps me up? Still a great album, but not what i anticipated from Cedric. But after listening to their Ep I guess it's expected because of the direction the band was going in the EP. I guess, I got to let go of that high intensity that was once know as AT THE DRIVE IN. Rip."
4,Well...I'm De-Loused,"Let me Preface this review by saying this is my favorite CD I own. That being said, It still gets 4 stars, not 5. While the band is enormously talented, the production is over the top. This really shows through in ""Cicatriz ESP"". The song starts and ends strong, but whats with the 3 or 4 minutes of ambient noise in the middle? I also am a strong believer that, while the lyrics have a cool sound, they are absolutely there as a formality; and no one, including the writer, really understands what phrases like ""Exoskeletal junction at raliroad delay"" really means. The Vocals are absolutely fantastic. That man has an amazing range. Theres some amazing fast pitched tempo changes such as on ""Drunkship of Lanterns"". All in all its a fantastic cd if you don't mind a little over-indulgence on the writer and producers part."
5,Words Can't Describe.,"I'd say I was a fan of At-The-Drive-In... I'd even say I was upset to hear that they broke up when they did... But,fromdeath comes life and The Mars Volta is it! This CD NEEDED to come out to kick others in the [behind]where they needed a good kicking. I bought this album on a chance with out hearing anything from it.. I'm going to tell everyone that reads this that it's probably the best cd purchase I've made in 3 years. It's soooo Amazing. My opinion of it is, that if Pink Floyd met At-The-Drive-In, you'd get THE MARS VOLTA!!![.] BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!![.]"
4,Doesn't appeal to my taste though I can still appreciate it,"I give this albumn four stars simply as a matter of personal taste... It definately has five star quality though.As an At the Drive In fan, I was interested in what Mars Volta was about so bought the albumn on faith alone. As a matter of taste, I have found that I liked AtDI's rock edge that Sparta adapted better, however - this albumn is still awesome.Everyone should hear this album at least once... if it appeals to you, I can almost guarentee that you will never stop listening to it. It has that sort of quality. The vocals are really bizarre and intriguing, the guitar is like nothing I have ever heard, and the flow of the album makes it more like one long song with a bunch of movements than a lineup of individual tracks. This is probably the most original act I have heard in the past decade. Not everyone will like this (as I can account for), but even so, there is no denying that this is darn original, unique, and quite good."
5,Brilliant,"This album by the Mars Volta is brilliant. The album starts with an energetic few tracks, and goes into a spacy jam of Cicatrez ESP. It ends quite abruptly feeling, but the ending leaves you satisfied. The story is about a man named Cerpin Taxt, who poisons himself, goes into a coma, has dreams about bizzare things, and then wakes up, and jumps off of a bridge. (Very dark sounding, I know.) The story is actually great when put into the song, and his story can be interpreted as you would like, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala definitely leaves alot of lyrics unexplained. Guest appearences include RHCP's John Frusciante for Cicatrez ESP, and RHCP's bassist Flea plays throughout. ATD-I band members make a step forward from the previous genre, paving a path of their own. If you are interested in the story, there is a storybook available on TMV's Italian fansite. (Im pretty sure thats where it is)"
5,BUY IT,"This album is insane in more ways then just the singing, noises, drums and best of all guitar. I strongly recommend this if you are a first time Mars Volta listener. ....every track is different in its own way and progresses famously through to the end. enjoy it as much as i"
5,"complex, deeply nuanced and intelligent rock and roll","The Mars Volta have managed an impressive feat with their first full-length CD: music that will appeal to listeners from just about every genre imaginable. You will hear and read comparisons to Rush, Santana, punk and thrash, latin folk music, Radiohead, and many others, and all of those comparisons, while totally viable, are somewhat incomplete simply because they fail to take into account the full range of massive talent evident in this recording. Even the spastic thrash of ATDI reappears at certain points in the disc, but only breifly and with great effect.We have been treated to some amazing music in 2003, including the blood brothers, Radiohead and now The Mars Volta. Don't miss adding this piece of brilliance to your music collection."
2,I can make this easy on music listeners!!!,"If you like ""Rush"" and ""At the Drive In"" then you'll love this album. However - if you do not like those bands, as I do not, well this album just plain sucks. I mean really you might as well go listen to a gig by your local high school Jazz band."
2,NOISE?,"I like Metal, Rock, Prog whatever. But this album sounds like noise throughout most of the album, it has its moments....but most of it sounds awful in way that reminds me of Black Flag. I'm a touch disappointed after all the rave reviews."
5,Step Outside the Box,"There's a reason that you don't hear this type of music done with a consistency among the radio waves. Not many bands can wrap their minds around the task without rendering a virtually unlistenable album altogether. The fusion of intensity, relentlessness, emotion, and (most importantly) diversity is not often harnessed. TMV's sound is remarkably tight and makes sense to me in some odd way, which is ultimately the best way! The last time (and only time)I heard a band be able to artistically form this organized style was Arson Garden. AG coincidentally tops my fav band list to this day, not to be unseated by even the likes of Tool, Rush, or Peter Gabriel, so maybe that indicates the comparison of band I put TMV into the realm of. I have to get acquainted with ATDI to build an archival consciousness of their ability, but at this point, I'm ready to make the assumption that this the next best band on my list. Lets hope for durability and an unending creativity in the future."
4,What is there to say...,"Really, what can I say about this album?It took me so long to get my head round it and even now I don't think I can truly say I ever have.The guitars, vocals, drumming all add up to make a very interesting album, full of layer and depth and even feeling, if you can see through the layers.I don't recommend it to anyone who is a little un-adventerous with music, but if you are, buy it now!!"
4,De-loused,"This album is one of the newest and best things I have heard in a while. From beginning to end it is all original and unlike anythign I have ever heard before. I recommend it to anyone out there who likes good rock music, you will not be disappointed.Trucks, ptruckle@hotmail.com"
4,One of 2003's Best CDs,"A feast for the ears and mind, this guitar dreamscape fuses guitar-rock history and creates a masterpiece of cacophonous sounds and glorious noise unlike anything you might have heard - or everything you have ever heard all rolled into one sporadic and lethargic, glorious, pretentious dissonant transcendental trip. A rock-opera in the theatre-less sense, it's intellection based on the suicide of a friend, the deceased At The Drive In's Omar and Cedric newly define what art-rock could be and prog-rock should be for this new, inert millennium. In the cesspool that is the TRL-defined rock generation yearning for cred, Mars Volta reverberates under the MTV generation. Better for me. Better for us. My grade: A"
3,Spanish Rock Jams,"'De-Loused in the Comatorium' actually has a latin flavour to it's sound, eg, a more heavier Santana. The accompanying long 6 or 7 minute rock jams is nothing new. I hear alot of the same exact thing in 70's progressive rock bands like Hawkwind, etc, with the same type of Pink Floyd spacey/prog effects in the background. Since I wasn't a big fan of At The Drive In I only have Mars Volta's music to go on, so I really don't know what I'm missing. But what I haven't heard means that I'm starting from scratch, and this is basically a hybrid of old sounds come back again...a combination of a harder-edged Santana, Led Zeppelin, progressive-rock, with shorter intense bursts of drumming."
5,awesome,just freaking awesome. im not under 13 but im too lazy to register right now. i dont caare who you are. buy this cd. it might not be the best album ever (which i am convinced is out there somewhere) but its damn close. it altered my thinking and perception of the world. i hope it will do the same for someone out there.
5,Epic Soundscape,"It's not very often that I discover a band that convincingly blends so many genres I enjoy into a mindblowing cocktail. TMV explore everything from hardcore punk, funk and ambient jazz to fiery latin rythms. I started off with ""Frances"" and worked my way backward, comparing the two doesn't do either justice as they are two vastly different albums in terms of concept and sound. Although TMV,s lyrics are cryptic (as many reviews have pointed out), Cedric's vocal delivery will stir you emotionally and immerse you fully in the universe they have created in the narrative. The instrumentation is also so multi-layered that it may take you several listens to uncover its subtle genius. TMV took my taste in music to a whole new level.Try it! it may do the same for you."
4,Interesting...,"My Friend told me about these guys, so i checked em out. Interesting Guitar and drums. The vocals, well, Blew my Mind. Track 2 stands out as the greatest song with the greatest vocal range on this album. I may check out their new album."
5,Now I'm Lost.,"I am lost. I never knew there could ever be a cd as...Puzzling as this cd. Formed from the ashes of the semi-popular band At The Drive-In, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala have created the industry crusher of music alltogether. Because of this cd, there are much higher standards for bands today. The sad thing is this band may never reach out to the masses. De-Loused in the Comatorium is a journey through the suicide of a friend dubbed as ""Cerpin Taxt."" Right off the bat, this cd is powering. The intro song ""Son Et Lumiere"", leading into ""Inertiatic ESP"" is a song all by itself. Missing that song is like missing the first 2 chapters of a book, or the first 20 minutes of a movie. The cd isn't the same without it. This cd starts off high and doesn't let you down. If you want a band that actually puts thought into their music and makes music for a better reason then getting rich, you need to check out The Mars Volta."
5,True rock music for the 21st century,"I happened upon the music of ""At the Drive In"" late in their career and was duly impressed, especially by ""Vaya"", arguably their finest release. When I heard about The Mars Volta and this album I went out and bought it emediatly with a high degree of excitement. My first listening was full of disapointment and I skipped through a number of the tracks in disinterest. However, this album began to grow on me in a huge fashion somewhere within the second, third, and fourth listenings. I now rate it among the top in my rock collection and would not part with it for anything. I have never had an album grow on me so quickly and so suddenly. Something about the raw musicianship and free songcraft was elusive at first but jumped out in a big way upon further inspection. I would recommend this album to literally anyone, whether they know it is good for them or not."
2,Wow........,"This album proves that if you starve people of any real musicianship for several years, then give them a slight taste, and they will think it is the most brilliant, mind blowing thing ever.Unfortunately it isn't.If you like emo/screamo/flavor-of-the-montho, then you will dig this. It will also look good on your albums list on your iPod for when you are bopping around campus.If you want to hear some interesting new prog rock check out Deadwing or In Absentia by Porcupine Tree.I'm not going so far as to tell people their taste sucks as much as I am saying this isn't new or revolutionary in the least."
5,by far the best album of 2003,"oh man when i first heard this album i will admit i didnt really like it. but when i listened to the whole cd in its entirety i realized what exactly they were getting at while making this modern art masterpice. the musicianship is top notch and omar even throws in a little ATDI flair. cedrics vocals are a humongous leap in the right direction in this cd. altough they may tend to sound a little feminine at times, he still vastly improved on his vocal style.all in all this cd is very art-spacey style with keyboards and samba-esque drumming and who and the heck can go wrong when you got FLEA on the bass i mean REALLY!!!"
5,Intense...,This cd rocks plain and simple. The singers voice may take a little getting used to but the music is insane. Punky and yet proggy at the same time. Lyrics are emotional and gut wrenching.Guitar playing is cutting edge.The first 3 songs will definitely hook you but the entire disc is great. Buy it and give it a shot. You won't regret it.
5,AWESOME!!!,well this was an album that was highly anticipated a year before it even came out. And you know what...they didn't dissapoint at all. this album is like Led Zeppelin with an At the drive in twist to it but far from sounding like at the drive in. i fell in love with this album from the moment the intro started. the only song i dont care for is televators (kinda boring and long) which brings me to my next point. the songs are very long. they give you a good 7-9 mins a song so your in for a ride here. id definatly recommend buying this album. cant wait to catch the live show
2,Is this children's music?,"Lose the french horn, the flower-gazing feel-good aura, the gaudy on-stage robes, then expand the lyrics beyond the track title, and deLaughter (all the way to the bank, apparently) might have something worthy of adult listening. Ouch much!P.S. Really, this represents the worst kind of psychedelic revival I've heard, the kind only Christian types could latch their lame, restrictive tastes onto. Yes, I said it!"
5,SEE THIS BAND LIVE,"Just has someone stated above, you have to see this band live. The experience will be one to remember. Seeing 24 people sing and play with such love and conviction fills you with such and overflow of emotion dancing and singing is the only remedy for release. This band is completly contagious. The album is short, but look out for future developments from this inspirational band...You must see this band live...its amazing"
2,Flaming Lips meets Up with People,"It's ok, but frankly their songs all sound alike. They definitely ""borrow"" a lot of their stylings from the Flaming Lips. They kind of have their schtick, but they beat it to death and so it it gets boring after a short while. Watched them open for Bowie..don't believe the hype, as again it was just repetitive and pretentiously boring. They lost me when they brought out the harp (oh my!)."
2,Wasn't quite was I thought it would be.,"When I heard this band on a few stations, I thought they would be a powerful, optimistic fusion of Sigur Ros and the Flaming Lips (if you could imagine that). I picked up the CD, and yeah, I did like it, but it didn't meet my expectations.When I saw that the CD had a nearly 40-minute track at the end (Long Day), I was hoping for a beautiful session of music that would utilize the talent of the 20+ members of this group. I was hoping for a great track that could be on in the background, but instead, it's a self-indulgent throw-away track filled with bleeps and sounds that would make even Radiohead turn in disgust. Without this last track, I would have given the CD three stars. Hopefully, they will have grown more for the next album."
3,Return of ELO?,"Every era needs bombastic, overblown fluff that's more fun than funny, and more signifying than significant. Might as well be these guys. I'll take 'em over most wannabe soul stars with overblown melisma - there's something to be said for just singing the damn notes and knowing the difference between harmony and a buncha guys singing at the same time (yes, I'm talking about you, B2M). However, like Electric Light Orchestra before them, I expect in about 10 years we'll be saying Polyphonic who? Enjoy them while you can."
1,Hyped up,"I was exited to hear this CD after hearing the single Soldier Girl being showcased on the radio. I am really disapointed as all the other tracks blend into a seemless soundscape of sickly sweet noise that eventually becomes a dirge. I wanted to enjoy it so much as I am a huge fan of Prog Rock and psychedelia. The mantra like lyrics can be quite depressing if they catch you on a downward spiral. I have friends who rave about this CD, but I just can't catch the vibe."
5,Duncan C. White,OK....yeah so Tim's old band were a bunch of drug induced rockers...but have you ever heard of being reborn...Tim has come along since Tripping Daisy...to say that this group of people is under the influence and that they are decievers is just wrong....The Polyphonic Spree are about just having a good time letting the music soothe you and taking you away....Just close your eyes and let them take you on their journey...I say its about time a band just plays for the sake of having a good time instead of the whole money making scam...These guys rock...Oh yeah I am from Dallas...
3,Follow The Day,"While surfing TV, on a SCRUBS re-run, I suddenly see a roomful of people in robes start into an infectious pop song. Based on this performance, I'm curious! It's the song called LIGHT AND DAY.Research got me as far as this disc. But along the way, we learned that THE ETERNAL SUNLIGHT OF A SPOTLESS MIND film also happened to like this tune well enough to include it."
1,Made me ill,"I love all kinds of music and consider myself an open-minded listener. I picked up this album after having heard a couple of songs on the radio and expected to love it. However, this is the first CD I have ever bought that I have considered throwing in the garbage. While I like some of the songs, notably ""Light & Day/Reach For the Sun"" and ""Days Like This Keep Me Warm,"" I found the majority of the album to be simply irritating. I have tried several times, but cannot get more than 4 minutes into the horrid ""A Long Day"" track before I feel like vomiting and my dogs start howling. I have never had such a visceral reaction to music before, and I hope to spare others the same pain. I have enough respect for the artists not to toss this disc in the trash, but it will be the first album I've ever traded in at a used record store."
1,Not again!!!,"I will keep this short, this CD is Mindless prattle. I enjoy music that has meaning, and depth. Well this cd is as plain and deep as a VERY shallow puddle. Also the Cult image of the band is a real turn off. If you have seen them preform, you will want to run away even faster, as they really do seem to be in an Altered Cult state. Bad ""music"" F-"
3,Buy Circulatory System Instead,"This is interesting and has its uplifting moments, but it ultimately lacks substance. Circulatory System explores similar terrain but digs deeper (and soars higher) both musically and lyrically. I give Circulatory System five stars."
1,DISGUSTING,"By far, this is the worst thing that has happened to contemporary music for a very long time. I feel as though this group is some type of cult. It is disturbing and apalling to listen to. Please, take my advice and DO NOT buy this CD."
1,PLEASE GOD WHY!!!!!!!!!,"To put it plain and simple they are terrible. Every is talking about them, about how terrible they are. In a time long ago i was watching tv then i saw them. You have to be on acid to understand them they makemy mind hurt. I dont like to be happy i like to not be. That music made me wanna beat myself on the head with a bunt object. That guy needs to shave his sideburns they disturb. Listen to someone good Danzig, listen to AFI, listen to Ministry. You can even listen to someone terrible like Hilary Duff. Please just dont listen to them."
1,THIS BAND IS A DAMN CULT!!!!!!!!!1RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,"THIS BAND NOT ONLY SUCKS ASS THEY ARE A FREAKIN CULT, NOT SINCEHEAVENS GATE HAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WENT THIS FAR TO FOLLOW THERE PSYCOTIC BELIEFS, AND I ALSO BELIEVE IF YOU LISTEN TO THIS CRAP BACKWARDS YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR HIDDEN WORDS THAT TELL YOU TO KILL YOURSELF AND JOIN THEM ON THERE ONE WAY TRIP TO HELL, DONT BUY THIS DONT GO SEE THEM DONT DO ANYTHING TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS BAND OR CULT, STAY AWAY BECAUSE IN A MATTER OF TIME THEY WILL PROBABLY COMMIT A MASS SUICIDE, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,It's not quite there,"There is something definitely missing from this CD, I just can't put my hands on it. I wanted it to be completely enveloping and beautiful, but it fell short. Still, there are very wonderful moments like the IT'S THE SUN AND IT MAKES ME SHINE chorus, or the whole of Soldier Girl. I enjoy the 4 song EP more than the whole album and the last piece on the album should've never made it to the final recording. But I do like the idea of the Polyphonic Spree. I do enjoy the fact that there is a market out there for this type of stuff. So I expect a hugely over-produced major label release of some band with a name like the Polyphilharmonic Jamboree to be released soon and crush the Polyphonic Spree thus ending this hippy dippy stuff. And yeah, it does remind me of the Coke commercials of the 70's and also of some sort of cult. I'm kind of scared of listening to them too becuase the guy gives out a weird stare."
3,interesting... don't look it over,"I actually started looking into this band because one day I was sitting in a movie theater wathcing the pre movie previews and they have a music video usually on once in a while and I guess that ""Light & Day/ Reach For The Sun"" is going to be in Jim Carey's new movie ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or something... but the song just sounded sooo happy and I thought hey I'm always looking for something new to listen to and so why not. so I went and bought the cd and it actually turned out to be a pretty good cd... the only song that I have a problem with is ""A Long Day"" it pretty much just sounds like someone snoring or like if you were in a glass chamber and someone had the music and vacume and their car door open (the beeping noise that it makes) at the same time."
2,Polyphinc Spree...Friend or Foe?,"i thought the polypohic spree was pretty funny, until i came to the realization that it wasn't a joke. And then for some reason it became ten times funnier, this group is obviously a cult... and i say its about damn time someone brings a new level of insanity to the entire music industry. look at it this way there has been musicians who have bitten heads off bats, ""entertainers"" who are being promoted as having been shot 9 times, and ""artists"" who worship the devil, but never has there been a group who will inevitably commit a mass ritual suicide...no doubt in public on stage. So Polyphonic Spree i commend you for attempting to raise the bar for insane publicity stunts for all ""artists"" to come in the near future.-Sardanapalusrespect1 time"
1,WHY DO THEY HAVE TO SING?,"All the instrumentation they use is great. They are very good at music, but when the singing starts... PUKE."
2,More honest when it was called tripping daisy,"This music is peppy and sweet(sickly sweet). I give it 2 stars because most music is discordant and crappy. However, the endless positive vibe of the music doesnt fit with the true nature of it, its like the music demands you believe its the most uplifting, beautiful, spiritual experience ever: its not.Tripping Daisy Tim Delaughters first band was a drug band, one of the members was killed by heroin. I'd like to believe the Polyphonic Spree is some kind of spiritually enlighened group experiencing bliss in robes, but they're just another drug band, so at the end of the day they're deceivers.Looking at the reveiws for this band, a lot of people like to be deceived."
1,polyphonic what?,"I bought this CD based of some of the customer reviews. I was SO disappointed. If polyphonic means, no two singers ever hit the same tone nor do the voices fit to the music, then well, its polyphonic. The lyrics are just trite, the melodies are poor. Do yourself a favour and listen to the 'Long day' intro above. Do you really want to spend money on more than half an hour of that... that... electronical experiment? If so, my CD is for sale, and I hardly ever do that: usually I find something interesting in almost every kind of music. But in this polyphonic thing, there was just nothing to find."
3,Great build up.....,"....and then the ending is rushed without any explanation as to why the ""freaks"" came to be or what really happens after the most lack luster conclusion to a stories i have read. The art and 2/3 of the story are 4 star quality."
4,Freaks of the Heartland is a must-read!,"Wonderfully painted art and a haunting story of fear and hope, now collected in a beautiful oversized hardcover edition. Worth every penny!"
5,"A little different for Niles, but in a good way","Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) many other of Steve Niles' works, I was expecting similar fare in this book. However, instead of the sinister creatures and cutting wit of previous titles, I was surprised to find this to be first and foremost a heartwarming tale of two brothers who find themselves in a bad situation. Plus, freaks -- who can go wrong there? I can't recommend this title highly enough."
1,Disappointment,"When I first acquired the iopener it was great. As a person who knows nothing about computers and has no desire to know, this item was ideal and opened up a whole new world for me. Within a few months I was forced to acquire my own I.S.P. It went down hill on the day I informed iopener that I was going to do so and even before I actually did. It has been one of the biggest and most frustrating disappointments I have ever experienced. Only one time did I ever receive any help from technical support out of countless times I have contacted them. DON'T buy it.t"
1,the clock ticked me off,"I so looked forward to receiving the eiffel tower clock and when it came ... very promply I might add, I was disappointed that the vertical trim under the round clock area was crooked and couldn't be straightened. A battery was not included and several days later and after throwing away the packaging, I purchased a AAA battery to only discover that something inside the clock was loose and moving around so when I installed the battery, of course it didn't work. As I mentioned, I threw away the packaging so I assume I can't return it. I learned that lesson the hard way!"
1,Not the real thing...,I am a devout Amazon.com customer as well as Bumble & Bumble customer so I was greatly disappointed by this Super Rich conditioner product. It simply doesn't have that B & B smell nor does it do the same great things for my hair. It really seems to be a different product in a B & B container...
1,"Packaging Yes, Contents no.","I purchased a case of bumble and bumble products through Amazon. Not only was it shipped in shoddy newspaper, but the contents of the Bumble & Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner smell and feel NOTHING like that which I buy from Bumble and Bumble in NY. It makes me wonder if someone in the middle isn't messing with the contents. I tried contacting Amazon to complain, with no luck. I recommend buying from a salon that you know and trust as the product (when you're actually getting the true contents) is a fine product - 5* in my opinion."
1,Defintiely not real product,I purchased the super rich conditioner. It didn't look right or smell right. I had a little left in my old bottle and compared the products (old bottle was purchased from B&B site) and they were NOT the same. I was ripped off!
3,Nice...but not really worth the bucks.,"It's an okay conditioner, but for me not fabulous. It does a fine job of moisturizing, and it smells nice . I like the texture, and all, but it just doesn't quite do IT for me, not enough to spend the money on this product. I don't detest it like Creme de Coco, nor love it like the Color Support or Pureology's Nanoworks. I will get through this bottle, and most likely not repurchase.It isn't quite hydrating enough, and it doesn't give my hair as much shine and movement as I like. Like I say it's ok, but not my HG.It does no harm.... I have highlighted, long, wavy hair, that is pretty healthy despite all those things."
2,So-So Product,Product was so-so; not worth the price. Didn't seem to make any difference in the war on frizzy hair.
3,Great conditioning but...,"does not have a nice smell at all. In fact, the more I use it, the more I despise the smell!"
4,Super Rich Conditioner,I chose this product because the slaon I went to used it and I liked the way my hair felt.

4,"First time's a charm, but the second?","Geoffrey does a good job at predicting the weather the first time he has to do it. But the second year, he oversleeps and then gets distracted by the ensuing media frenzy. He eventually issues a decision based on a phone call to his mother.Simple line drawings are accompanied by the fun-to-read front pages of newspapers from Geoffrey's town. Mr. Koscielniak may have confused groundhogs with beavers, for they are all depicted with protruding front teeth. No matter: this is an amusing Groundhog Day story for the young."
5,"Old but not dated, the best","Lewis Herman certainly knows the subject, almost all there is to know. Published in 1952 ( Second printing ) it old but an excellent reference book for any one studying the subject, starting on his or her first script, or re-writing one that has been done before. A must for every film-maker's bookshelf."
4,a way correct,"the Throw Max has seemed to help correct the problem with my daughters throwing form, she is throwing the ball a lot better."
2,Horrible,"Horrible book with dozens of grammatical errors and is pretty much exclusively Caesar's Civil War Commentary and Cicero's letters about the Civil War. It's dull, repetitive (Caesar speaks of his two stolen legions every chapter), poorly illustrated, the given vocabulary usually aren't the words/idioms one would need to know, and it has no correlation to Wheelock's Latin, which is what most people use in Latin 101. You'd be better off with a fan Latin translation of The Legends of Zelda!"
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting study of women's conditions in the most strictly secular country in the world. Even though the Turkish state and the majority of the Turkish people strongly oppose veiling and such pseudo-religious attacks on women, there has always been a small group of opportunists seeking to gain power by exploiting and misrepresenting religion. The backwardness of the majority of Muslims outside of Turkey strengthens the hands of religious demagogues within Turkey. So do the political Islam of Iran and Arabia. Add to this the rapid pace of industrial development in Turkey and the consequent alienation of the rural population and you get an explosive mixture. This book gives an interesting sociological analysis of these conflicts. Turkey (the most secular, democratic, European country) bordering the Middle East will no doubt triumph over the past and present demogogues of pseudo-religion."
1,Bunny Modern= P.O.S.,"i wanted to like this book, but it was so poorly written that it simply wasn't possible. i don't feel so bad hating this book after seeing the multiple folks also give it one star.let's put it this way, i think mr. bowman has family living in grinnel iowa, because under no circumstances could this be a 5 star book. three maybe, four if you know the author, but this is a book only the mother of the author could give 5 to.ma bowman, shanme on you!"
4,"Very, very creative","I can see where a lot of the frustration with this book comes from, but I really feel that a lot of the reviewers are being overly-harsh. This is so much better than something that genuinely deserves a 1-star review. The story is something that's almost completely original. I didn't find anything here that was derivative of anything else I've ever read or seen. If nothing else, David Bowman was able to think up a crazy story without having to borrow any ideas from the vast realm of pre-existing literature-for-the-insane."
3,original,"Well, this book came from a very strange place. I laughed quite a bit in the first few chapters. The premise is so original, I can see it as a bizarre video game. The writing style was better than average. More inteligent than the usual overly descriptive Sci Fi garble. Wit and unusual references to pop culture kept it interesting. My only problem with the novel was that as the story progressed, it kinda hit what seemed to be a phase of plot block. The environment and characters were so unique that even the author seemed lost as to where to take them. The end seemed contrived and forced. The book is worth sitting through the first half or so though. Like I said, it would make an imaginative and fierce video game. I can even see the nanny action figures and subsequent merchandising."
2,Disappointing,"Bowman's style is engaging at first, but once one gets past the cleverness of his set-up, things fall apart. The relationship between the narrator and Clare, the nanny protagonist, seems promising when he is observing her from afar, but falls apart once they actually meet in the flesh. Still, i enjoyed the book until the not-so-climactic confrontation in the offices of NBC, a scene which lasted about two chapters longer than it should have."
4,If you like the bizarre...,"I loved this book. It's completely irreverant, odd, witty, charming, and says a lot about pitfalls of urban society. Think ""Handmaiden's Tale"" written by Christopher Moore. It's just that weird. A great read."
1,"Very disappointed with the product, . . .","YES, I was very disappointed with the product for the following reasons:1. There was NO invoice delivered with the product stating the return policy (so I didn't know I had only 1 month to return the piece of *&$%^ JUNK). But, I'm returning it anyway, . . .2. It was NOT delivered in the original packing box (as pictured above). Yes, it was bubble wrapped for shipment, butit did NOT make it work (any better).3. This was probably a 'refill' cartridge because there was NO 'pull tab' to activate it (refill was NOT stated when I purchased it).4. And, when I finely installed it in my printer -- it did NOT print. So, I took it out - - shook it to mix the contents and re-installed it. Still did NOT print. (I noted when I shook it, that the contents did NOT move or make a sound. It felt like Iwas shaking an empty cartridge).I would NOT recommend this seller (S.W.I.T.)."
4,"Great for your collection, not a how-to book.","I ordered this book looking for some direction & inspiration while designing a book cover. It's a beautiful book, covering decades of work, with small blurbs on each book. These blurbs help clarify the subject the artist was trying to convey, which is sometimes fun to figure out.HOWEVER, if you're looking for a how-to book, this is not one. Maybe I should have read the other review a little better. But if you're looking for some history and inspiration, this is a great book. I'm glad I bought it, even though it's not what I was looking for."
5,Wow!,What a great gift! My sister-in-law is a journalist with a big heart. I ordered this as a Christmas present for her. I think it will please her tremendously.
5,Great music - very well produced,"This is an extremely well produced program balancing interviews, informal singing with an acoustic guitar and live concert with a full band. There is an extremely cool edit/blend with Dion singing live in the studio, blending to an old American Bandstand appearance to a modern day live concert. That alone was worth the price of admission.Even though I've been a big Dion fan and a disk jockey for many years, I really enjoyed the stories that Dion shares about what influenced his music and his life.This was so good I bought two copies to give as gifts."
5,Worth The Wait,"It only took 45 plus years to watch Dion on DVD and it was well worth it. The DTS sound and picture quality is excellent. The back up singers are second to none (better then the Belmonts).....Don't be afraid to turn up the sound. Dion never sounded so good. Great arrangements with ""Love Came To Me"" , ""Donna The Prima Donna"", ""Teenager In Love""...... If you're a Dion fan, you will not be disappointed with this concert."
5,Best DVD I Have ever Owned,"I have over 350 dvd concerts the best of everyone ""Dion"" on a scale if 1-10 is a 20 absolutely the best DVD I have ever owned and I got them All"
5,best of his hits - live,"Dion is lasting. His work has spanned several decades and there will be day when this rock'n roll hall of fame star will be noted even more prominently in early years of rock and roll. Lou Reed said he had great ""chops"" and if you don't know what that means - buy this DVD. A handful of his largest hits coupled with some acoustic interludes and introductions this is both a concert and a personal meeting with Dion. A live concert and more. Years have passed but his vocal chords have not! His range still is wide and takes you away. Beat, rhythm and tune, tune, tune. Enjoy. You will not be disappointed!"
5,A CLASSIC PERFORMANCE,I bought this one for my husband and ended up loving it as much as he does. Dion is so laid back and the music old and new is superb.
5,It could not be more fun!,"This book has been a real joy. The wonderful lessons and interesting pages have kept my children really enjoying thier early learning. Out of all the books on our shelves, this is the one we welcome day after day. It is a tool that can be used over and over and never seems to grow old. I would certainly recomend this book to anyone looking to teach a todler or strenthen the skills of their first or even second grader."
3,beggars can't be choosers,"A great event in music history, a terrible recording. As another reviewer says, it is like somebody is in the audience with a cassette recorder. But it is the only copy of this opera I could find."
5,An incredible thrill,"Sills' Pamira stands for fearless singing and fioritura to blow you away. I love Sills in anything Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Handel so I absolutely love this live-recording. The sound is only so-so, but so what? It's a glorious performance that shows why Beverly Sills is still appreciated and loved today. Now please re-release her Norma!"
2,Scanner Incompatible with Our HP Printer,"After purchasing the Epson Perfection 1240U scanner, we found out that it was incompatible with our HP DeskJet 882C printer. I contacted Epson Technical Support by e-mail for assistance. When I did not hear from them after several days, I decided to telephone their long-distance number. The person I spoke to suggested downloading additional non-Epson software to resolve the problem.The download was made but the copy-utility problem remained. Another phone conversation with Epson ensued. This time the person told me to talk to the software company. An e-mail response from the software company eventually offered no solution either.Since neither Epson nor the software company could solve the copy-utility problem, we returned the scanner and put an end to our costly and very disappointing experience."
3,Should have known better......,"After reading reviews about installation problems, I should have known better. It took several hours to install and even though the Epson patch fixed the scan/copy function I still had occasional error messages. It had debris under the scan bed just like many other customers complained of which is unacceptable. On the other hand, the scans were very crisp and sharp. HOWEVER, all scans of photos were noticably darker than original. I could not for the life of me fix this problem. Even my poorly rated HP4200C took better scans without having to edit the photos. Will send it back in morning. I will not purchase another Epson product."
1,Ticking time bomb,"I used to like this scanner except for the excessive amount of dust previously mentioned in other reviews, then, I unplugged it. I tried to plug it back in and it would not work, the twain drivers were not recognized. After reinstalling both the scanner and twain drivers per epson's 5 day late response it still would not work. I suspected compatibility issues with Photoshop or Fireworks, uninstalled those programs, removed any reference to twain extensions or epson from the registry to no avail. I plugged in a co-worker's scanner which worked immediately. Epson probably has some of the worst software coders I have come across. Finally, I solved the problem, running it over with my car ala Office Space."
3,"Fast, crisp . . . DUSTY","A great scanner with excellent features that would have rated 5 stars if not for and excessive amount of dust on the *inside* of the scanner glass. I read about this problem from previous customer reviews, but decided to purchase it anyway, hoping perhaps my scanner would be dust-free. Nope. Thank goodness for Photoshop's Dust & Scratches filter which puts a band-aid on the problem, but obviously does not cure it. Methinks a replacement scanner is warranted..."
3,dumb panel,"I've had the 1240u for 2 months .Running off aMac G4 with 192 mg's ram and Photoshop 6.0. It scans with the twain from photoshop acquire with no problem , in fact I must say"" excellent"" . The Copy utility works great. Text bridge is a Mickeymouse version with no support feedback whatsoever. ""dumbpanel"" takes about 3 or so minutes to locate and showup (lots of memory given to it) Email only with Outlook xps and Photoscan button only with Photodeluxe. If you avoid the simple stuff it's a good scanner.Epson phone does agood job but many of there techs did not no what to do. Newsoft is the worst."
3,"Fast, sharp...DUSTY","An excellent scanner worthy of 5 stars if not for an inordinate amount of dust on the underside of the platen. I had been warned about this by previous customer reviews but decided to purchase one anyway with the hopes that mine would be different. Wrong. Thank goodness for Photoshop's Dust & Scatches filter which corrects the problem, though obviously does not solve it. Methinks another scanner is warranted..."
3,Missing part at a hefty price,"This is a good scanner for the money, but if you're looking to scan slides or transparencies CAVEAT EMPTOR. The necessary EXTRA part (#B813172) is a 'precision' piece of plastic that costs an additional ~$100. Include this cost in your calculations and be aware."
3,"Alot of what you'd expect, some things you wouldn't.","When I installed this scanner, after reading all of the positive reviews and glowing comments, I guess my expectations were a bit high. First off let me say that the scanner itself is very high quality and worth every penny. It is fast and clear and worthy of its rating for utility. But.....I must also comment that for such a highly rated scanner to NOT have an on/off switch bugs me. You actually have to plug in the scanner to use it and then unplug it when you are finished with it. And the noise this scanner makes, eeek! It is a cross between a star wars movie (laser type noises) and a power drill. It is much louder than my cheap Mustek scanner from 7 years ago. It is a good scanner if you want high quality at a reasonable price, but you will be crawling under your desk to turn it on and off, and if you have pets they may hide under the bed when it is in operation."
2,Worked GREAT.. at FIRST!,"Okay.. had I posted a review for this scanner within the first few months of owning it, I would have given it rave reviews a-la most of the other reviews here. I'm glad procrastinated. I noticed dust starting to appear in my scans. At first they were negligable, easilly mistaken for a spec on the picture itself, but I can fully attest that over time the dust will accumulate under the glass and your scans will have a considerable amount of noise. Sure your software can clean it up, but a quality scanner shouldn't make you do that manual work. So in short, I only recommend this scanner if you love dust! I wouldn't take it for free if someone gave it to me! The only reason I rated 2 stars instead of 1 is becaus it did work well for the first few months. After sitting, it's become useless to me."
3,"Good scans, limited software","The scanner functioned well but I was unable to get it to scan into WORD 2000 as an insert without having to format the insert(the size was 1.3x1.7 in. not 8.5x11 in. as scanned). They do not even have WORD 2000 on their system to be able to dublicate the problem. I have owned an HP, and ASTRA scanners an did not have this problem. You can not scan transparencies unless you buy their adapter, the twain will not be active for this option unless you plug in their lid. The copy utility can not be set to default to your settings, it returns to color normal each time it is opened. I spent several hours with tech support and the said the would get back to me on these issues. Their answer was to buy Lasersoft software...so I could control the settings. I returned the scanner."
1,"Naughty Monkey Women's Motor Psyche Boot,Black,9 M",i was very disappointed when these arrived.They are fake and cheap lookingI sent them back immediatly
5,Totally worth the money,"I have listened to two of the CD's and I am in the third one, from the Old Testament, which is normally a narrative scripture, so there is only one voice. The book of Jonah allowed me to hear some of the other voices, the dramatization is very good, not excessive. I do not regret buying it at all. The quality is good, and I am happy with the case too."
4,Easy to follow and understand,I'm trying to really learn and understand the Bible for the first time as an adult and I find the CD's enjoyable to listen to. The narrator's voice is enjoyable to listen to and it is easy to understand since every day words and application are used. I highly recommend it.
5,Soothing and relaxed ( :,"I truly enjoy the New Living Translation on CD. I am able to listen to it at work as well as at home. I creates an atmosphere of peace at work, and at home it's like my grandfather reading to me as I can sit back with a cup of tea. I continue to reap the blessings from the cd's."
5,GREAT WHOLE BIBLE ON CD! OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT,I NOTICED ONE REVIEWER SAID THEY THAUGHT THIS WAS JUST THE NEW TESTAMENT. I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IT IS THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS. I HAVE OWNED THIS COMPLETE SET FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW AND I REALLY LIKE IT. WORTH THE MONEY!! I AM CURRENTLY PUTTING IT ON MY IPOD SO I CAN LISTEN TO THE BIBLE WHERE EVER I GO! I highly recommend this translation in hard copy for reading as well!Also I am LOOKING FOR A LIST OF CD TRACK NAMES. IF YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND THEM POST A NOTE AS A REVIEW. THANKS.BRICE
2,"Not a 1/4"" punch","This is a 3/16 inch punch, not a 1/4 inch punch. Worked fine on 18 gauge metal but would not punch 16 gauge."
3,Decent purchase,"Like others said, PST is both melodic and aggressive. It makes for a nice contrast and they pull it off best in the songs Time Has Come, Return to My Home, and Master Jack. Definitely a good purchase. For a few songs, like Human Earthquake, Right On, and particularly Babies and Dust, they are repetitive and I felt like these were ""filler."" I hope their next work is more consistent concerning the contrasts within each song."
1,Description size wrong,"The description lists this bulb as being 2"" by 2"". In actuality it measures 1 1/4"" by 1 1/4"". Not worth spending more money to send it back."
4,Visually pleasing,"If you are trying to write a science encyclopedia for under 700 pages, the biggest issue is probably what to leave out. In part, this is dictated by what type of audience you are targeting.The editors seem to have pitched this offering towards a high school crowd, or perhaps also towards primary schools. A nice, colourful reference, with text that is carefully written to a general audience. Understandably, there is an emphasis on topics with visual appeal. Nothing wrong with this, if it gets readers into the book.The book is also economically priced. Affordable to school libraries on tight budgets."
5,Amazing,"The sound quality of this disc is amazing. You can hear all the instruments and all the nuances and subtleties of the music. It truly has that club sound which is so rare. This is a different type of show then ""Live,"" which I love. The sound on ""Babylon"" has always bothered me. It is recorded to low and must be at max vol to really hear the playing. ""Roxy"" is a must have!!"
5,This is a must buy for any Marley fan.,"This is a great listen with a quality pair of headphones. While the live set keeps you groovin, the encore CD alone is worth the price of this set. I highly recommend that you get this show ASAP."
5,THE BEST LIVE BOB MARLEY,"I got to see Marley and the Wailers live a number of times -- which shows my age, if nothing else. I had always thought that the ""Live"" album, at the Rainbow in London, was the closest to the actual experience of seeing this amazing group -- but fell a bit short. Seeing the band live was nearly a religious experience, like Gospel music complete with ""call and response"" sections for the audience. This Live at The Roxy is far better than that earlier ""Live"" CD. The second CD, in particular, which includes the encore, is 22 minutes where they simply tear the roof of the club. If this doesn't make you move, you are dead."
5,The Closest to Seeing Bob Live,"There is no doubt, this is the best live Bob Marley album yet to be released. The show takes place at the Roxy, a small club in Hollywood CA. This sets it apart from Live, and Babylon by Bus (which are both five star records in their own right) but there is a sense of smallness here, the show is more intimate, more focused. Imagine seeing a band who could easily sell out a stadium in an area not much larger than your own backyard. Bob and the Wailers explode on stage hurling massive amounts of energy throughout the small venue. The entire second disk is the encore, with the last three tracks meshed together, in a deep, stellar reggae groove, worth buying the album alone. This second disk provides a close look at the imporovisational talent of Bob, and the great jammin ability of the Wailers.Turn the lights down low and the stereo up and you'll almost feel like you're there. A must have for any fan of Bob Marley or even live music in general."
5,Marley at his greatest!,"This is probably one of the best Bob Marley albums out there! Lots of great tracks especially the 24 minute Get up, Stand up/ No More Trouble/ War. I highly recommend this live album, if you don't know which Bob Marley album to get, this is the one."
4,Another great LIVE Bob Marley Performance,"For great artists, the live performance is always better than studio recordings and the Marley live recordings always deliver. Live at the Roxy is great because it has a real nice tight feel, most likely from the club setting. The sound quality is great, the crowd noise actually adds somehow to the listening experience instead of disturbing it. Live at the Roxy is a great buy and a must have for any Marley fan, however, it is not as powerful as Babylon by Bus. Babylon by Bus, in my humble opinion, is still the high watermark for available Bob Marley live recordings and is probably one of the greatest albums one could possibly own."
5,Perfect Everyday Carry Knife...,"I love this knife, and I'm positive that you will too. You probably are familiar with the quality of Buck knives and this one is no exception. It is made in the USA as well. It feels really good in your hand. So solid and well made. Also comes with a really neat nylon sheath that just looks really cool. It is extremely easy to open with one hand; easy to close as well. I could not find this knife for a better price anywhere else. So unless you find it on sale somewhere you probably shouldn't waste your time looking around and just buy it here. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this knife in any way. I also have the same knife in a fixed blade with white cattle bone and malachite handle. But it's too pretty to use! You really can't go wrong with a Buck, and if you are thinking about buying this knife you should go for it. You can thank me later. :)"
4,a book with alot of character,this is a very interesting read that I got a chance to fully go through. it keeps your interest&never lets up.this Book leads you on a journey of overcoming the Pros&Cons in so many various life situations. I enjoyed the pacing&flow of this Book.I always welcome a Book that makes you think&Feel something. you will gather many feelings&thoughts upon reading this book.very interesting.
3,A lot of fun,"Neanderthals, a futuristic experiment that changes what it means to be human, strange monsters, and someone messing with time, all come together for a fun novel. Surprisingly, it's not completely light, as it also explores what it means to be human, especially in regards to the neanderthals as compared to the early humans. And, with the future humans, the idea of taking away normal emotions and substituting artificial ones, depending on the situation is fascinating.A lot of fun, and another one that includes Captain Jack. The scene where the Doctor tells Jack to distract everyone is hysterical: in true Jack form, he takes his clothes off and runs streaking through the crowd.An easy, entertaining read. Gareth Roberts also wrote The Shakespeare Code for the Tenth Doctor and Martha, one of my favorite episodes."
4,Best of the Bunch,"By a country mile the best of the 6 Ninth Doctor books. Roberts writes a funny and touching tale, with his trademark spot-on characterisation."
5,Great addition to the tv series,"I wasn't so sure about adding the books to the rest of my Dr Who experience, but the details they add to the show are great."
2,"This Books got ""Wibbly Wobbly"" at the end...","I'm not an evil reviewer, really I'm not! I understand that when you write a book for a TV show it's really hard to keep the characters the same, and make the dialog work. I know that it must be very hard to write a book for, what I think is the best TV show ever. This book starts out great, the plot was interesting, the concept was great the set up was fantastic and then the book just falls apart. The ending was rushed, chaotic, dumb, and painful and not painful in a good way, a very bad painful. The only thing that saved this for a one star rating was that there really were some amusing parts in this story that I enjoyed. I really wish it hadn't gotten all wibbly wobbly in the end because this could have been my favorite Doctor Who book if it had held together."
2,This was just...bad,"The story was ridiculous even if you take into account that Doctor Who isn't Shakespeare. It wasn't even in the category of so bad it was good. It was just bad. The author didn't come close to getting the character's ""voices"" right and it read like bad fan fiction. I would recommend either The Monsters Inside or The Stealers of Dreams instead."
2,Whew...glad I'm finished.,"I was enticed into reading this through an arcticle in Golf Magazine, but wound up a bit disappointed. Read the other reviews about the typo's, and yes, they're all true. Was an editor ever consulted? I'm sure Tim Rosaforte is a great writer, but he should have taken more care in this piece. Besides the typo's, time lines of events jumped around so often, that at some points, I didn't even know who won the event.The book was entertaining, but nearing the end, I kept counting how many pages I had left to read to be finished with the book...and that's not in a good way."
2,PLEASE PROOFREAD,It is absolutely enthralling to consider that we are living in a time where the greatest golfing machine of modern time is dazzling us. The book that captures this time is poorly written. Somebody please tell me was it 1998 when Medina held the PGA or 1999? Or was it both? Did Tiger win with a 270 at the Masters in 1997 or a 280 - Both are mentioned in the book.This book should have never gone to print; it insults the reader that there are multiple facts misstated throughout.TIGER IS THE GREATEST.THIS BOOK IS NOT.
1,"A Golfer/Reader in Alexandria, VA","This is generally a good read, but I found the number of careless typos to be very distracting. The first paragraph, for example, ends with the word ""done"" where it clearly should have read ""alone."" I chuckled at seeing this (the words do look alike, after all), but I soon found myself simply shaking my head in disbelief at the carelessness with which this book was produced.In their rush to press, didn't anyone proof this thing... not even the first paragraph?"
2,Even Tiger Junkies Will Be Disappointed,"I have seen Tim Rosaforte on the Golf Channel and read an excerpt in Golf Digest so I was looking forward to this book. There were so many errors and typos--misspellings, wrong words, one whole section out of place--that it was hard to concentrate on the text. Many of the quotes were simply taken from Golf Channel interviews and shows. There was little evidence of research. It was clear that this book was designed to make money by capitalizing on Tiger's celebrity and was rushed to print while we were still talking about the 2000 season. Do publishers have editors and proofreaders any more? Save your money."
1,Raising The Bar,"Boring. Boring. Boring.I almost gave up on the book after about 30 pages, but it was given to me as a gift and I like to finish that which I start.If this book had to be written (?) then it should have been written by someone who could at least hold your attention, if not excite.Tim Rosaforte shows little writing talent and one wonders what he is doing to raise his own bar. His readers and Tiger deserve better.Having read John Feinstein and having grown up with the writings of Jim Murray perhaps my bar is set too high.To anyone who wants to take a chance on this book I recommend the public library."
1,Wait till they lower the price or hire a proofreader.....,"I was genuinely distracted from the content as I found myself reading every page ""looking for more typos, inaccurate facts, etc"". Many are noted in previous reviews....Butch Harmon is referred to as Bruce....David Duval is later called Davis....etc. I do not know the publishing process but I would think an author should have a vested interested in proofing his product....as well as many others. It is obviously an effort to cash in (the book itself had interesting facts, if you can trust themmmmm)......but also seemed disjointed and like it was slapped together without connection between chapters....bottom line - an inferior quality product given it is a 24 dollar hardcopy new book......wait for the next revision......"
1,Lowering the Bar,"While I find Tiger to be a fascinating individual, it amazed me that this book made it to press considering the grammar and spelling are the equivalent of a rough draft. If you can make it through all of the typos, and there are probably more typos than Tiger's career birdies, it is a pretty good read. I found myself looking for the next typo instead of enjoying an amazing story. Rosaforte, has lowered the bar for what is considered acceptable to print."
3,SHALLOW STUFF HERE,"I enjoyed the book simply because I enjoy reading just about anything about Tiger. That said, I must say I was rather disapointed in this particular read. Not much original thought or insight to be found here. I was rather amused at the author's efforts to use every arcane and obscure golf term he could think of. He was a bit like a ""name dropper"" but in this case, he used ""golf jargon"" rather than celebrities. I also found I extremely difficult to follow the sequence of events. The chronology did not always work out. (I do wonder why publishers do not use editors anymore???? If I had one I certainly would not be misspelling so many words). Often times I found one event or one bit of information referred to differently, even in the same paragraph. All in all, I have read better."
2,Hardly Any New Stuff Here,"This is a wonderful book if you have a cursory knowledge of Tiger Woods and his brief career.But if you're a die-hard golf fan who has read EVERYTHING written about Tiger over the last 3 years, you'll find that ""Raising the Bar"" contains hardly any new stuff. Almost everything is a re-hash of the quotes we've all read. There are some exceptions, but not many. If you read the book's excerpts in the Jan. 2001 issue of GOLF DIGEST and found them compelling and intriguing -- as I did -- you'll be very disappointed with the book. You can't blame the author for this; Tiger and his team hardly ever reveal anything about themselves."
2,Lowering the Publishing Standard.,"As an avid Tiger watcher, I was thrilled to receive this book as a gift. However, my excitement soon waned. The book--obviously pushed through the publishing process to exploit Christmas shoppers--contains a distracting number of typographical errors. (""Earning"" for ""learning"" and ""rage"" for ""range"" to name a few.) Furthermore, ""Raising the Bar"" reads like three years' worth of sports columns strung together with a hard cover slapped on. This is all old news, kids."
4,Friend of the Intellectuals,Francis and Edith Scheafer ministered to all walks of life but what i found to be fascinating was Frans way with Intellectual debate. Though he had bout's with anger yet when it came to ministering he was as gentile and tactful as they come when confronted with various questions. His wife Edith came to understand her husband through many experiences they had and you cannot put one above the other. Both loved each other very much and were one in spirit.
4,"A simple, yet fascinating little biography","This look at the lives of Francis and Edith Schaeffer is one of Barbour's ""Defenders of the Faith"" series of biographies written for young people. Thus the book's style is simple, but readers of all ages will be captivated by the faith and zeal of these two famous missionaries. Well researched and complete with notes, this easy read chronicles their lives from birth to beyond Fran's death, focusing on how God led them each step of the way and used them mightily for His glory. Strongly recommended for jr. and sr. high students, but anyone who needs to learn what God can do with faithful witnesses will profit from this book. May God raise up many in the rising generation to follow in the Schaeffers' footsteps!"
4,Excellent Quality,Amazingly nice sweater. My son really likes it and he is definitely picky. It is a really soft knit and very comfortable.
2,Brilliant complex fast music,"If the lyrics of some songs and the production of the album wasn't so bad, this would have been one of my favourite albums for sure. However there are 3 standout tracks that couldn't have been better (Skull beneath the skin, chosen ones, looking down the cross) Mechanix would have been cool too if Dave Mustaines vocal delivery wasn't so poor on that song."
4,Pretty Good,"Not bad, not bad atall, apart from the production, this album remains as one of the very first classic albums in thrash history !!"
3,3 and a half actually,"Ok, keep in mind I am reviewing the un-remastered original CD here. Great music, horrible sound quality, and terrible vocal recordings. I mean horrible. You can't understand a single verse that Dave sings throughout the whole album. The drums sound hollow, the guitars are tinny, and you don't feel the bass in your chest like you're supposed to. I cannot stand listening to this record because the quality's so bad. Hopefully and surely the remastered version due sometime in 2002 will give Megadeth's debut album the quality it deserves."
3,A Good Start,"Killing is My Business was a good start for Megadeth, but nothing more then just a good start. No real classic deth tunes on this album, but still some very good tunes do appear. Last Rites/Loved to Deth and Looking Down the Cross are the best songs off of the album. In the end I enjoy all the songs on the album, but the average music fan will probably be turned off by the poor prodcuction, and the plain technical wizardry of the guitars. This album should be left for fans of other thrash bands, and hardcore fans of Megadeth."
3,"A Good Start, But Not Their Best!","Do you realize how harmful it can be to a great group like Megadeth when you insist that one of their most primitive efforts is one of their best? The music on this album to some extent resembles Metallica's ""Kill Em All."" (Understandable since this is what Dave Mustaine was familiar with at the time.) Is this record a good start? Yes. But it certainly DOES NOT reflect Megadeth's finest efforts! I liked Shakespeare's ""Two Gentlemen of Verona."" But I will not harm Shakespeare by insisting that one of his mediocre efforts is one of his best! It was not until Mustaine's ""Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?"" and ""Rust in Peace"" that it becomes obvious Metallica threw their arguably strongest element away."
3,Killing Is My Business ...and Business is Good,"I had this album on tape for years and finally got the cd for Christmas last year. I would have given a higher rating if the entire album had been transfered to this pressing of the cd. It's missing the ultra-classic remake of the old Nancy Sinatra song ""These Boots are Made for Walking"". If you got the current pressing of the cd and you have'nt heard ""Boots"", you don't know what you're missing."
3,Only a foreshadowing...,"Don't get me wrong; I have every Deth album out there, and love 'em all. This ""album,"" (clocks in at an anorexic 27:34) has serious problems. The brief classical opening is a creative idea (or shows the lack thereof) but doesn't enhance or contribute to the quality of the work. The guitar work seems scattered and confused, obsessed with powering fast for the sake of powering fast. With PS...BWB, there's a method to the madness, but here it only distracts. The lyrics are unintelligable, which is a real problem since there's no booklet. The production is inadequate at best.FYI The band was given something like $4000 to make the album; half of it was spent on drugs before they even got into the studio. That's why the production is so shoddy- couldn't afford a real producer! Well, live and learn...If you're looking for great MegadetH speed metal, go for Peace Sells or RIP. This is for completists only."
3,Not bad,"This cd was not as good as the 3 that followed it, but it is worth getting. I haven't heard the remastered version yet, but it has to be good, because the sound quality is one of the biggest problems with this cd. The songs are all pretty good. I'd have to say my favorite is ""Chosen Ones"". Dave's solo is awesome, and David Ellefsons little bass solo is cool. ""Looking Down The Cross"" is also one of the better songs. One problem with this cd is you can tell that Megadeth was just starting out. They didn't really establish themselves as one of the best metal bands with their next album(also their best) ""Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?"" On KIMB, you can tell how real Dave's rage is. Listen to his singing, his lyrics, and even his guitar playing. I think this is the worst of Megadeth's first 4 albums, but that doesn't mean it's bad!"
4,"great, but............","This is a great album, but the production is one of the worst. Still, this is still the old megadeth, fast and heavy, but they shouldn't get high before they make a record!"
2,"Well, thank God Megadeth progressed from this....","Some flurries of talent show on this disc, but what mostly shows on this album is how a man kicked out of Metallica loved using drugs and not using money on any production and not bothering to write many good songs. Loved You to death is great, but most of the other songs (including the awful original version of the Four Horsemen) do little for me....Their next album would be legions better"
3,Not bad....check out other Megadeth releases!,Not a bad first release. I would recommend Rust in Peace or So Far So Good So What. The album is raw metal to say the least.
3,Megadeth's Freshman Effort!,"Out of all the Megadeth albums, this one is for the hardcore fans alone. Dave Mustaine and Co shred here, don't get me wrong, but the production value is slim and Dave's voice gets on the annoying side of things--if you can even understand it. Skull Beneath The Skin and Rattlehead hi-light the cuts. Mechanix is hot--many people think this is the alternate version of The Four Horsemen by Metallica (which Dave co-wrote, too) but it was actually a discarded song off off Metallica's ""No Life 'Til Leather"" demo that never made it onto Kill 'Em All. Like the aforementioned Metallica effort, 'Killing' is juvenile and simple, a lot of aggression, a lot of senseless lyrics and bad progression changes and off-key riffs at 500 m.p.h. For the Megadeth junkie, it is a must. If you're not that into them, pass it right on by, there's better Megadeth to be had. It's not really worth the effort or the cash."
4,Biz is Good,"Raw, decidedly lo-fi, dirty production, yet one can actually hear the bass. Pretty good considering they probably recorded this thing for $1,000.Wouldn't say this is a 5-star album. But it is what it is. A healthy 4-star debut by a legendary thrash band. And it certainly tops anything they did post-1990.Despite the production limitations, the song quality is decent. The only real clunkers are 'Loved to Death' and 'Rattlehead'.Buy yourself a used copy of the original pressing. This is not meant to be reissued or remastered."
1,Embarassingly bad album.,"I try not to exaggerate as much as other ""metalheads,"" but I think this is one of the worst albums ever made, in any genre, made even more pathetic considering some of the landmark thrash metal albums that were being released at the same time. Bad sound, lame songs, and Mustaine's horrible voice (thankfully it got a little better, later). The best thing about this album is that it is mercifully short. It's somewhat of a tribute to Mustaine that he recovered from this disaster to produce an album as good as ""Peace Sells."" I think even ""completists"" should stay away from this, but if you have to have it pick it up at a used CD store."
2,"Just Another ""I've Been Around For Twenty Years"" Sales Pitch","I bought this book based on the glowing reviews on amazon. I didn't expect much because I remember the author from my management days at Merrill Lynch and true to form that's what he delivered. There is nothing new or earth shaking in this book that people in the financial serivces industry have not already heard a billion times, unless you are devoted to phrases like ""envisionin the future"" and you enjoy affected books containing quotes like the one by Thomas Jefferson in this book about searching for the truth. The author is great for taking what others have done and reguritating it back up. Genuinely new offerings are not his forte. Read Jeffrey Gitomer's Sales Bible, books by Brian Tracy, special books like the Psychology of Call Reluctance or Selling To Vito to get the real edge on genuinely helpful info that managers can use."
5,Jim Zitch Branch Manager with Prudential Securities,This is a must read for anyone in the financial services business. The arena is changing fast and you can use it as your guide to keep up and excell.
1,"The Worst ""Romance"" Novel Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","This book is soooo stupid and boring. Not only do the two leads have no sexual chemistry, they have no sex, but are in love after two kisses, Please. I was so upset that I threw the book in the trash the day after i bought it. Stay away from this book and its author. They are both a waste of time."
3,Slow moving,"I had higher hopes for this book. It took at least 100 pages into the book to really become interesting. Once it picked up it really did end up being a fantastic book. A little light on the action though. Seemed something geared more towards a younger crowd. Heroine in the book is kinda ditzy and expects everything to be handed to her, so by the end of the 2nd book you are kind of sick of her whining. Would recommend though for someone just starting out in the whole paranormal scene."
3,Conflicting information?,"I say this book was bleh for me, I only picked it up because Mary Davidson wrote a blurb on it. It was okay, but ... Sarah.. was just so normal..... She doesn't have Anita/Rachel's kickass ness, nor Betsy quirky shoe love, or even just something that's unique to her. I think the romance novel I picked up had more personality than Sarah. But anyway, it was an okay read despite all that. The one thing that gets to me, is the description of how the vampires die. On page 52 I think, Thierry tells her that ""...must be very old"" since it was a pile of goo that was left. However later in the story, Quinn then says that the older vampires disappear the fastest while the young one stay solid, and what happens to the traitor of the club proves it. Somebody should have caught that...."
1,Horrible,"I could go on for ages about how awful this book is! With the language and writing style of a middle school girl, in addition to the total lack of character and/or plot development, it was a herculean task to even finish it. The main character is the most unlikable and unrelatable of any character I have ever come across. This book is a total and utter joke. I strongly suspect the good reviews on here are planted by the author and publisher. This may be the worst book I have ever read, and I read a LOT."
2,"Ok, the second star is a pity star","I wanted to give it one star, but didn't want to be too mean. I did actually read it all. I wouldn't advise you to do so (seriously, you'll never get that time back!). I found the leading lady to be unsympathetic and somewhat annoying, the vampire hero to be predictable and a little boring. sigh. I was so disappointed by this book that I had to immediately reread the Twilight books. Now THERE's an interesting couple, and they're only teenagers (sort of...)!"
4,CUTE BOOK,"I was ""smitten"" with this book, cute book, story kind of dragged, zero romance, just kissing,. I read the book in a day & 1/2. Probably could have taken 1 day to read it, but had to sleep.This book would be recommend for someone who likes paranormal (vampires), but can do without the heavy romance. I did not read any foul language or graphic detail. book made me giggle a little due to the main character."
