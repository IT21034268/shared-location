3,Raises an interesting idea,"This book was a required text for one of my graduate school classes. The refreshing thing about it is that it's a quick read and very easy to understand. Hammond raises the very interesting idea that instead of looking at problems from a ""how do we remedy our weaknesses"" standpoint, she offers that we should capitalize on our strengths. We should figure out what we do well, and then work through our strengths to improve our performance and organizational environment. That's really as far as you need to go with this book. Hammond's explanation of her theory is extremely common sense. If you're still unsure how her theory could be applied in or impact the workplace, perhaps you should read this book. Otherwise, you could probably just use your imagination."
5,Gates never ceases to please,"Came on time, with o-ring type gasket, OEM appearance, and gates quality. Good deal with prime shipping. Would not hesitate to buy any Gates products, as long as it is a genuine gates backed by their warranty."
2,Not quite as outdated as the rest of Drouet's work.,"This was the fourth part of Drouet's revision of the Cyanobacteria. He was a botanist of the old school, and he lumped most of the existing genera and species together because he believed that most of the morphological diversity in this group was due to different environmental conditions and not to genetic diversity. This belief was based on unpublished data, so most researchers, botanists included, ignored his work. Some great drawings. May be of interest to researchers of this obscure group of Cyanobacteria because it is one of the few studies comparing them."
5,Expensive but build to last.,"I was recently freed from my terrible Oster blender which finally died. Although it was outside my inital budget, I've tested this model daily for the last two months and I can say that it's recommended for daily duty.Firstly, it's made of quality materials and incredibly solid. It has a simple and elegant look that you'll proudly display this on your counter rather than hide it away (which is a good thing because it weighs a ton). The one piece stainless jug has a unique look and is easy to clean.Secondly, the performance is amazing for smoothies and milkshakes. It makes short work of the ice and frozen fruit in 15 seconds. The motor can work through a number of runs back to back without any worries. I love the two speed switch because I never understood why a blender needed 10 speeds.Finally, I expect this to work for a very long time but the blender includes a two year warranty, great customer support, and easy to find replacement parts."
4,KitchenAid,"Great one piece canister design. If you have ever cracked the base ring mount on a lesser blender this is the one for you! No frills, great power. Stutter start is a little disconcerting but you get used to it."
5,WOW what a blender!,"This blender does it so fast you can hardly believe it! It is so powerful you would think it could crush bricks, but don't try it! Power, speed, and it looks great too!"
2,BLACK SHAMPOO,"A blaxploitation movie that did not receive as much notoriety as Shaft, Superfly or the Mack.Rightfully so!!!!!!Not as memorable as they were. Low budget, forgetable soundtrack.Only bright spot, some comedic relief from two members of the supporting cast.Recommended for anyone who is a staunch lover of the Blaxploitation era, otherwise not worth your time."
3,Soft Core Porn=Black Shampoo,"Though I am a fan of blaxploitation movies and I am collecting them all Black Shampoo was nothing short of watching a soft core porn, bad acting and all. Though for me, blaxploitation movies are all about the bad acting and just looking at how far the directors went to make a movie. This movie is indeed ""exploitation"". With scences often having the main character ""whoring"" himself out to women and us often getting a flash of skin every other second this movie is indeed soft core porn. But for its worth it definitely entertaining 1 time and that's the first time you watch it. If you are looking for a rare movie of blaxploitation I reccommend this ""jewel"" but if you are looking for a ""movie that goes beyond mildly enteraining"" look elsewhere from Johnny's tight white pants."
4,Black shampoo is a funny movie,Not everyday does a movie like black shampoo come along. This is the funniest movie I have seen since Billy Madison
3,Strange comedy,"A very blood-thirsty movie of an Afro-American macho surrounding himself with same-gender-attracted employees depicts, probably, the US reality of seventies by screening Mafia activities mixed with sex and murdering.Also a comedy, it left a sober impression."
1,NOT WORTH IT,This movie SUCKS. The synopsis didnt make any since even for a 70's movie. One of the worse black exploitation's ive ever seen.
4,Old school,"Black Shampoo was good, the plot predictable, but non the less good, afros and 60's outfits. A blast from the past."
3,Better with the sound off,"Being a huge fan of ""Army Of Darkness"" and the ""Evil Dead"" movies I'm easily excited by a chainsaw wielding hero... but no dice here. The budget and perhaps the times may be to blame for an extremely safe interpretation of chainsaw battle. This movie is also very slow.3 stars for some decent visuals (very much represents the styles of the times) ~Could be fun as a silent screen saver during a party (maybe with some Snoop Dogg or chainsaw styled metal guitar playing)."
3,A Near-Perfect 70s blaxploitation film,"If ya wanna see a pre-Days of Our Lives Tanya Boyd (who also co-stars in the direct-to DVD For Da Love of Money) in all her natural glory, then peep this, fo real. It's very stereotypical from first frame to the last with Mr. Jonathan seducing a white customer at the sink! The film goes a bit soft core porn with he and Tanya, and prior to that, he and one of his insatiable customers. Let's not forget the two gay hairdressers he employs are funny (for the day) and the film goes from one conventional plot point to the next, but what film from back in the day doesn't? Sit back, enjoy, pop some popcorn, get some 420, chill, and enjoy.Tag this Willie Dynamite, Dolemite, Superfly, The Mack..."
3,groovy,"silly movie, good plot, something different. i still watch it for entertainment value. i got it to see if it would be something new and it pleased me very well..it has sex and violence in it if your into that type of things. good classic, underground movie 3 stars"
4,Good Solid Movie,"I really dug this Film.THe Sex,Humor went hand&hand.Alot of Cool Action.the film gets to the point without a long drawn out story line.it's Worth Checking out especially on a Saturday Night."
3,Too many types,"I thought it would be fun to change up the chocolate chip cookie, but I realize that the original is the best!"
5,Dorothy Sayers' Most Entertaining Mystery,"Murder Must Advertise is Dorothy Sayers at her best. This storet in a London advertising agency, is a hoot to read - especially if you've ever had the misfortune to churn out ad copy for a living. Some people would tell you to start at the beginning of the Peter Whimsey series, but I say start here. This is vintage Sayers."
3,Lord Peter at work,"Like PG Wodehouse or the early Agatha Christie, this offers a window on a bygone British world (perhaps largely fictitious even then) in which every class had its place and its peculiar argot, and true noblesse oblige consisted in the ability to transcend such differences. At least this is one of the most likeable characteristics of the detective hero Lord Peter Wimsey, temporarily working under a pseudonym at a London advertising agency. This allows for an amusing send-up of the publicity business, at a time when success was measured by the ability to coin a catchy jingle. But you do need to be a Brit or a dyed-in-the-wool Anglophile to make much of it; the climax, for instance, depends on the detailed description of a cricket match. And as a mystery, this is one of Sayers' least successful, with the suspects insufficiently distinguished from one another, and the ending much less of a surprise than it ought to be."
4,Sayers at Her Best,This is a classic Dorothy Sayers book. It is one of her best because it features an early 20th Century workplace and has solid characterizations.
4,"Good, but lacks ""atmosphere""","I don't know where Dorothy L. Sayers got the idea for this one but I do consider it one of her lesser works. It probably had notably more positive impact in England, during the period in which it was written, where Lord Peter Wimsey getting a ""regular job"" would have been a real knee-slapper. Still, the mystery itself is well-written. If you can live without spooky houses, murder on the moors, and those sorts of cool English cliches, this one will probably work for you. Otherwise, read Sayers' ""Unnatural Death."""
3,egyptian lover is great!,"but the pyramix falls a litte short.only because it doesn't have alot of his greatest songs on this cd.it's a great cd but,couldve been alot better.this cd is great only if you're an egyptian lover fan."
4,"Not Bad, for size and price","If your looking for something small(Pocket) that will help you get the general idea for a Greek word this will work. Like I said it will be a general idea, definetly not a concise lexical defintition. It maybe weighs in at a hefty 1 pound, but if your a true disciple of NT Greek this could be another tool used in your arsenal. I do not know of any serious student that only uses one lexicon. Thayers, Souter, Newman are all decent additional resources but BAGD 3rd edition is the standard. So until you get BAGD these other will do, but be careful always cross reference the word in several lexicons to get a fuller idea of the word. Seek the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding...He will make your paths straight...God Bless You"
2,Too bad this is all there is out there for this,"The results of this program for me were - nil. Although I did enjoy the process - it was calming and soothing, but it didnt help with my out of body training. Plus it lacked any instruction or text with it which I felt it needed."
5,Great resource for children,The text is easy to read with helpful picture/photo representations that compliment rather than dominate the entries. The definitions are straight forward and the pronunciation key is very user-friendly. Overall this dictionary is a wonderful start for a child's reference library.
1,Disappointing!,"I bought this unit for inflating car/SUV tires and blowing off my workbench. It produces very low airflow, so it takes forever to add even a few pounds of air pressure to automotive tires -- and the gauge is all but useless for determining the pressure of whatever it is you're inflating. I've never reviewed an item before -- and (because I can't locate the receipt) this item's going to Goodwill. It works, but for a few extra dollars, I'm convinced I can find one that's better."
2,CM sephadex gel chromatography,About the ion exchange chromatography for the separation of proteins by using CM Sephadex.
5,My all-time favorite shoes,"About ten years ago, I bought my first pair of New Balance 1220s. They look good and they feel right. I've gone to the running shoe store and tried on plenty of alternatives. I've even owned a few highly-recommended different shoes, some by New Balance and some other brands. Some of them were far more expensive. I keep coming back to the 1220 as my favorite shoes. Now, I buy a new pair every year. I don't wear them for running. I wear this year's pair for casual wear with jeans or shorts and last year's pair for walking and hiking, which I do for exercise. They are so comfortable that I don't even notice them any more. Recommended!"
5,Dramatic Tchaikovsky from Muti,"This is really a terrific set. As stated elsewhere, don't look here for refinement. This is the set to turn to for uninhibited thrills: growling basses, walloping tympani, and Italianate passion. IMHO this set has the best 2 & 3 out there, making everyone else's sound like they're sleepwalking through the scores. And the Manfred is just stunning. After I got these I still kept Muti's Philadelphia 5; makes a nice contrast. Good fillers, too."
5,Good travel shoe.,This was good for when you have a golf and travel day as you don't have to fool with changed shoes.
2,PERFECT STRANGERS (cover) Deep Purple,"While I will admit Dream Theater is a GREAT GROUP with top players, I was completely PISSED OFF that nothing is mentioned about the Deep Purple cover song ""Perfect Strangers"" being a couple short ""clips"" shot in a studio, maybe 30 seconds of what looks and sounds as if it were recorded by the world's worst camcorder...My whole point to purchase this DVD was to enjoy seeing them play Perfect Strangers one of my favorite songs ever... Misleading information and makes me not like the entire DVD."
5,Wonderful stories.,"These are marvelous stories. Very moving, beautifully crafted, absorbing. We read this with my book club and all of us hugely enjoyed it. What a wonderful writer!"
5,Excelent book!,"I'm so happy to purchase this book, the envelopment was original,the issue is more interesting than I expected!I received it before the time indicated Thank you so much!"
5,From the Cover,"Bruce Larson shows us how a full and exciting life is one of the best ways to maintain physical health and prevent illness. In a series of insightful chapters he clearly shows the psychological and spiritual principles that you can apply to your life. (The many individual examples will show you how others have done it!) Best of all, these are not constricting and limiting but liberating and life-changing. The physical benefits are a wonderful side effect of a rational and biblical life-style. You'll find here a basic guide to an inner health that can also be a powerful and joyful aid to maintaining outer and physical health."
2,Too basic for a dedicated RMI book,"This is a fairly basic introduction to RMI, going nowhere near the detail available through the JDK documentation. This is not a book for those already in the know about RMI. The author tends to make a big deal of inconsequential topics (eg. the server name does not need to be specified when binding). A lot of effort is spent in showing java code to do things ""the hard way"" or even ""the wrong way"" (eg. doing your own serialisation, writing a socket comms protocol) without any attempt to explain why you might want to (other than ""Becuase you might need to"" - although I suspect its probably ""to pad out a book""). The content of this book would have made a decent chapter in a larger, more general ""advanced java"" book, but does not provide enough meat to stand on its own."
2,Useful but Advanced Tech. for Java Developers is better.,"Advanced Tech. for Java Developers contains in one chapter what this book drags out. But ATFJD also gives you good info on Beans, Servlets, JNI ... . If some one gives you a copy of Java RMI you will get something out of it, but buy the other one. I bought both (sigh)."
1,Incompetent book,"This book is not for a serious distributed developer. The book takes a look at RMI from 100,000 feet. If you are a serious RMI user, you are better off reading Javasoft RMI tutorials and RMI specification."
1,Save your money to buy other books,"The following are the reasons why I give one star 1. The sample code in the CD-ROM does not match in the book. a lot of files are missing in chapter 9. 2. the sample code still use old 1.0 event model 3. I sent questions about how to get the up-to-date sample code but the author never respond.If you are interested in 3-tier application using RMI and JDBC, I highly recommend George Reese's book - Database Programming with JDBC and Java"
1,too big,this thing was huge it took up too much room in the freezer and broke quickly i wouldn't recommend it to anyone
3,too large for kids,The actual pops it makes are HUGE! And the tops are almost impossible to get off without melting some of the frozen pop. One nice thing - you don't have to thaw the entire tray because they come out. Also easier to store because you can store them in small places inbetween other food.
2,Received package open and missing parts,"I was excited for these when I ordered them, but the package arrived open, and with only 4 and half of the 6 molds in the set included. I returned it immediately. I'm still looking for popsicle molds but I'm hesitant to order these again given the trouble the first time around. I've seen at least one other review stating they were missing some of the molds, so you might want to keep in mind that you may not get a full set!"
3,popsicle,"I haven't used the item yet, but it is very cute!! And i look forward to using it. I just want to eat all the popsicles in my freezer before I make some."
1,Difficult to suck,"I was very excited to order these popsicle molds after reading all the positive reviews. They are very easy to make and look lovely. Eating them is another story! A popsicle should fit comfortably in any size mouth and I'm a woman with a very average size mouth. The popsicle was too big and has too many ridges to allow you to suck it...you never have enough surface area in your mouth at one time to melt any of the juice! It's not what you expect from a popsicle at all! I now know that a popsicle needs smooth sides, not ridges...it doesn't work for me at all and it drips!"
3,Not this one!,"Great idea, sturdy item, nifty design... BUT! Due to the star shape, it is very messy and hard to eat! Go with a smooth-shaped design, you'll be MUCH happier!"
2,Too Big,"These work great, but are way too big. Waste of good filling when no one can finish them, adult of child."
2,disappointed in results,"I was very excited to receive these, hoping to make popsicles for the kids into a fun family project. The design and size was fantastic; however, the popsicles were not easily removed (even after running under warm water), and the sticks pulled out of the treat. I ordered 2 sets, wasted $20 dollars, and my kids were very disappointed. I guess we will go back to buying popsicles at the store."
3,Hmmm.,"well i loved the colour the shape . & the fact that when i needed icepop molds in near winter/fall amazon had themi would not believe i paid too much if- the item was a bit more durable.about the ..6/7th use of them one of the inner sticks broke and now when you try to pull it out of the moldthe ""holder"" comes out but the icepop itself stays in the mold. which is pointless. you might as well freezeyour concoction in a cup if you wanted that..i gave it three stars because i didn't have to wait too longit looked like it wasand it worked o.K. the first few times i used it."
5,"Fun, Delicious and easy to use","These popsicle molds are great. I think they are a great design and well made. My 3 1/2 year old son helps puree the fruit and pour it into the molds. He has a great time, can't wait until they're frozen and is quite proud of contributing to our meals and snacks. Following the simple instructions is key - leave a 1/2 inch of head space when filling and use warm water and gentle pressure when removing."
5,5 stars for price and ease,"After looking around for a while, these are the best priced and most durable pop molds I have found. My kids love them and I love that I can fill them with 100% juice for popsicles that are healthier and cheaper than store-bought. Run them under warm water and they pop right out."
2,Drippy and difficult to unmold,"I find it quite difficult to unmold these. Running under warm water helps, but speeds up the melting process too much. And the little trays catch the drips, but then dump them onto your shirt when you go to take a lick. I'd rather stick with plain wooden sticks, now that I've tried these."
5,Lose Weight on Popsicles:,I swear you MUST buy these if you are tring to lose weight. Buy your favorite flavor of Crystal Light. Mix it with less water than the directions suggest. Drop some diced fruit into each popsicle form. Add the (strong) Crystal Light and freeze the pops. Something about the flavor and the texture is totally satisfying. Trust me. You will lose weight. Bon Apetite!
4,.,I love these things because they let me control what goes into my popcicles. They are a little tricky to unmold.
1,SPILL ALERT!!!!,"If you have even a normal-size freezer with anything at all in it, FORGET IT. The stand is unstable and any time anything accidentally touches the pops, they fall and juice gets everywhere!!! Ughhh!!!!!!! I'm really surprised no one else had this issue. Even getting these to the freezer was stressful, as they were wobbly and I was afraid they would detach and fall off. It's a shame because they are cute, but the traditional 6-pop mold style is far more stable."
4,Shooting Star Pop Molds,"A good product for healthy, homemade, summer treats! They're nice and big and easy to use. You do have to run them under warm water for a minute to get them to release but it's not really a problem."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased two sets of these with hopes of making healthy popsicles for my children. The first time I used them, we made a recipe that contained a lot of expensive ingredients. We followed the directions exactly and 4 hours later, we were excited to eat them. Sad to say, they would not come out of the mold. We decided to soak them in hot water for 10 seconds and that works occasionally, but I always have to get my husband to pull the bottom out. Not a good experience. Do not waste your money."
3,Messy Pops,"I was excited to buy these molds because they got such wonderful reviews, but I find that they are kind of difficult to eat, or maybe I haven't figured out how much to fill them yet...Anyway half of the pop drips uncontrollably onto the shirt of whoever eats them...Otherwise I like the way you can freeze them individually, and the shape is visually appealing, but I'm definitely not thrilled."
3,hard to get out,"I've tried running under hot water and squeezing - but it seems like the issue is at the top, it gets locked in. I eventually get it out after a lot of force. But i do like the molds other then that."
5,Love these,"I bought 4 sets of these star pop molds last month. At first when they came I realized how big the star tray was that you set the pops in, taking up huge amounts of freezer space since I make 4 sets at a time. After they were frozen though I realized all I needed to do was take them out of the tray and store them laying flat inside the freezer, taking up hardly any room at all. A wonderful bonus is that when a kid wants a pop I only have to run the ONE pop under warm water to get it out of the mold. All of my other pop molds that I have bought over the years I am always running warm water over the whole tray of pops trying to get out just one or two at a time. Overall I love these pop molds!"
2,I wish they had the rubber molds,"I bought these as a second set to increase the supply of popsicles for visitors. The first set I bought had rubber flexible molds that are super easy to remove. When you compare it with these I totally appreciate the others more. I love the shape, but wish it was easier to take off the mold. (and yes I know the running under warm water trick)"
3,Okay product,"I found these take up a lot of space in the freezer. One of the features that interested me was the star bottom on each pop that is supposed to catch drips. However, this is very small, and fills up quickly -- still causing drips. The clear mold is also fairly difficult to remove when you want to eat your pop. Unmolding took a fair amount of hot water, and resulted in melted pops. I would not purchase these again."
4,freezer pops,"froze fine, easy to get out. would like a straight line style base to fit in the freezer easier."
5,Hurray for Tovolo!,"Serves the purpose well, thinking about getting more molds of the same brand! I am very pleased with the result - serving my kids with homemade popsicles with known ingredients!"
3,Big mouth popsicles,"My need was to freeze water in the molds. They were difficult to release and had to held under running water, which decreased the amount of ice available."
4,Makes nice pops,"Pops are a nice shape and the holder fits well in the freezer. It can be a little hard to get the plastic mold off the pop, but if you run it under a little hot water for 20 seconds, it comes right off. Good product."
4,Make Great Popsicles!,"These are fun and my kids love eating popsicles in the summer. They are pretty big and my kids have a hard time eating them. I do like them, just wish they were a little smaller."
2,Disappointing presentation,"I do not recommend buying these molds as a gift for someone. The pieces looked junky on arrival, packaged in a cheap plastic wrapper not even big enough to cover them. There was no label or information about them -- e.g., saying they were Tovolo Star Ice Pop Molds. It looked like just a handful of cheap plastic we'd gotten at a dollar store. Embarrassing to give this as a birthday present."
5,Easy to use,"These made tasty pudding pops, I have also used a fruit juice smoothie recipe also. Easy to throw in the dishwasher too"
5,Love these popsicle molds!,"These popsicle molds are not only good-looking, but also solid and sturdy. They fit into their base firmly, which you wouldn't know by looking at the picture. I love that they can be individually removed from the base as well as individually filled with whatever you want. I fill mine with yogurt sweetened with orange juice, stevia, and fresh fruit chunks. This makes for a much healthier snack than the popsicles you can buy at the grocery store."
3,Not a good choice for small children,My son is four years old and the popsicles that this mold makes are so big and heavy that he doesn't like them. We also have a hard time finding room in our freezer for the set.
4,great ice pops,"We love these. My daughters love their ice lollipops and I like being able to give them a treat where I can control the ingredients. I water down 100% juice (using flavoured sparkling water gives a little zing), also use stoneyfield smoothie yoghurt drinks diluted with a little milk for a yummy frozen yoghurt treat. Very easy to use, healthy and good to the environment too."
4,Good for healthy snacks,We picked these out based on the other reviews and are very pleased. we have had them for a couple of days and already a big hit with my girls (7 & 4) and their friends. Clever way to get them to have the healty juices they would not normally drink. Also it is alot cheaper then buying the store bought pops. Hopefully they last.
4,Love them!,"They are exactly as described by the seller. I have to run the pops under water for 5-10 seconds before they slide out easily, but that is just fine with me. I've dropped the case and haven't had any cracking or breaking. These are adult sized pops, I can barely finish one and there is no way my toddler could finish one. The only part I don't like is that it's a pain to get the pops to unsnap from the base."
3,Not the Great.,"The game was fun, but it did not live up to the series. There was alot of cool things to do and wepons to get, but it was still lacking. It had all those characters and side stories but I felt cheated somehow. I didn't like the main character and the game was not any better than the 3rd one, from a visual aspect. It is interesting to play and it held my attention to the end but ........... You know....I'm going to just ignore this game."
1,absolutly terrible,"Compared to the first three games, Onimusha 4 is worthless. Nothing is the same, the gameplay is horrible, and it is way too easy. whoever made these new changes deserves a slap in the face. Save you money, don't buy this terrible game."
2,THE WORST IN ONIMUSHA SERIES,"THIS GAME HAVE GOOD GRAPHICS, GOOD SOUND, GOOD PLAYABILITY, BUT THIS GAME IS THE WORST IN THE ONIMUSHA SERIES, TRY A RENTAL."
1,Worst game in the onimusha series,"I had been an onimusha fan for some time now and this game was a BIG disappointment the cinematics were impressive as always but it goes down hill from there the game is way to easy you can walk around your enemies over and over and they will not atack. theres Noticeably recycles content from previous Onimusha games; some bad dialogue and implausible plot points mar the story. Having an ally fight by your side might sound fun but its no fun when he gets stuck behind a wall or fence and keeps swinging at nothing, It takes about 14 hours to finish the game if not more this game is all about quantity over quality save your money and buy something else."
1,onimusha has betrayed it's fans,"This is a big let down by the guys making the onimusha series first off why is the black oni blond? he should be japanese not blond or half japanese, making the hero blond was probably just a gimick to attract american customers, and i also hate how they took the cheap way out and didn't base the image of the hero on a real person like the 3 earlier onimusha games.(SPOILER)there are also rumors that tenki is samanosuke but tenki in the game cut scense and intro doesn't move or sound like samanosuke used to do in the earlier games, the reason for this is that the actor that did the japanese voice for samanosuke in the earlier games doesn't work with capcom anymore because they are getting cheaper voice actors.i am a hardcore fan of the three first onimusha games but i will definately stay away from this sorry excuse of a game."
4,Good reading for ravens or humans of any age,"The book does not preach or expound on any particular philosophy. It is as accessable for children as it is for adults. It speaks to a part of us that is looking for meaning and tells, thru allegory, of the many pitfalls in that search. If you have ever been in a relationship with someone who looked at the world differently, with different values than yourself, you will be able to relate to many of Joshua's adventures. Easy to relate to and full of interesting views on ravenkind. If you've ever wanted to spread your wings and expand your horizens and assist others on the way, Joshua is your raven."
2,Is life's true purpose really discovered here? I don't think so!,"I too believe that there is more to life than just eating and playing. I believe we each have a purpose in life and it is our responsibility to discover it. I was hoping that this book may give me some ideas about how to discover more deeply my purpose in life. Unfortunately, it wasn't much help. I don't think Joshua the raven genuinely discovered his true purpose in life at the end of the story. I don't believe that God speaks to our minds with such specificity and clarity as he does to Joshua the raven in this book. To me, this is a children's book. I wouldn't encourage my children to read it, however, because I believe the messages it gives about how God communicates with us are misleading and may confuse and distress young people seeking purpose in their lives. Some good advice that the book offers is to take time to relax and experience the serenity of Now - the simple joy of Being."
2,maintenance engineer,"This spreader is used solely for ice melt and I would never recommend this for this purpose. One bag in the hopper causes a lot of drag on the wheel gears and as soon as you hit a somewhat slippery surface the wheel locks up and is useless. I am sure it would be fine for seeding or fertilizer, but not sure it is worth the extra $$ over a good Scotts spreader unless you have a large area to cover and need the extra capacity. I bought 2 of these and the first one came with a chunk of the hopper broken off. Amazon took care of it right away so I am happy about that. I have had them for 1 year and the second one now has a broken hopper from a chunk of ice melt falling out of the bag. I think the plastic used for the hoppers is cheap and brittle from my experience. In Agri-Fabs defense they are sending me a new hopper at no charge though."
2,Poor craftsmanship.,I'm a former lawn professional and I was looking for a heavy duty affordable lawn spreader to treat my lawn as well as some neighbors. This spreader is no better than any option available at walmart. This spreader probably wouldn't make through a whole season without problems. I gave this to a friend and purchased a lesco spreader for myself. I'd only recommend this spreader for seed spreading.
5,Shiver Me Timbers!,"This one will send shivers up the spine. This is Sam Harris' best effort yet and these songs fit his voice perfectly. Beautiful and original arrangements! If you are trying to decide between this CD and ""Revival"" - please, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ONE!! Sam is at his best on this one."
2,Defective DVD drive? No famed customer support,"Basic problem is I can't move files from old computer to the new GT5228. The GT5228 DVD drive reads all data CDs burned on the old machine as blank. Three calls to Gateway tech support have bordered on ridiculous. I'd be better off asking some teenager on the street. One said I'd be better off returning the machine and buying a Dell (she also said everything was a ""third party"" issue, so she couldn't help me). Another told me to not worry about the DVD drive and just buy a thumb drive. That's all well and good and might finally get me around the problem, but it doesn't fix the problem that my DVD drive can't write or read a disc for the purposes of transferring files. That's a basic notion. I dread what else might be wrong inside this machine."
2,Disappointing,"I bought 5 books for a recent trip to Ireland and this is the only book I did not even bother to bring with me. Perhaps it is for a younger travel crowd (I am only 43) but it seemed overconcerned with clubs and trendy places, less interested in helping a traveller negotioate thru the rural and rustic parts of Ireland."
2,Somewhat Helpful...but lots missing.,"There is a lot of stuff missing in this book so it's not one to travel with and actually depend on like we did. We got lost often and the book wasn't much help. Lots of maps...but not all that great. The descriptions of restaurants and hotels is not very accurate...they make everything sound like you ""want"" to hear it rather than what it really is so you get there and think ""wait...this is it?"". It needs more pictures...a lot more pictures."
2,Just ok,This book is a very good reference for all the major attractions that you would want to see in Ireland but it lacks intimate knowledge of the areas that I was hoping to find in the book.
2,Ugh,"Sorry folks, I thought this book was wreched. I have been to Europe several times before, and usually enjoy the Lonely Planet series- I can credit 2 great vacations to their recommendations. Sorely disappointed in this edition. Terrible information regarding public transportation (which was significantly less available than in other major european cities- and which I would have liked to know)- there was no mention of the fact that in order to get the student fares on the train system, you have to come in to the country with a 'student identification card' that you have to apply for weeks ahead of time. Visiting Ireland is nearly worthless if you don't rent a car, I found out by the end of the trip from my own experience. Sorry Lonely Planet, this time, my trip was more costly than anticipated, significantly less exciting, and I came back feeling ""eehhh"" about the whole country."
2,not specific enough...,"Although Lonely Planet Ireland is wonderful for short trips around the country, stays of over two weeks reqire much more detail. I recommend Fodors guide to Ireland, as this book is just not full or specific enough."
1,"Biased, and therefore untrustworthy","Reading the book, it quickly becomes clear that the writers should make no claims to objectivity. The writing about Irish culture seemed strident and raw, as if written from embittered experience. I wasn't pleased to encounter profanity peppered into the descriptions, including the f-word and p-word. Sure, I'm a grown-up, but I thought this was a travel book? Then I encountered the text attacking the church, and the boxed section devoted to quoting and promoting a gay rights activist. Now, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I bought the book for an objective take on Ireland, not to promote or read about the writers' political or social agenda. I wish I'd known what we were getting before my wife bought the book. I can't trust a guidebook that seems to revel in its own slant. We're giving the book away to Goodwill, and we'll rely on the other guidebooks we bought, like Rick Steves' (there are so many out there)."
1,Out of date,"I found this book to be very out of date, especially in terms of pricing and logistics in both Dublin and the Dingle area. I went to Dingle, and found that the hostel they highly recommend as having a free shuttle no longer has a free shuttle or friendly/knowledgeable service. The hostel with the free shuttle and friendly service was not listed... Pretty much everything I used this book for was incorrect and I ended up spending much more than the cost of the book due to its errors."
5,Can't travel without Lonley Planet,"As always, Lonely Planet provides the best and most up to date information. Fail proof. Fool safe."
1,Absolutely useless,"After having made very positive experiences with the lonely planet travel guides we also bought the one on Ireland. But this one was really a waste of time and money. The recommendations are out of date, some of the B&Bs; recommended in the book are probably the worst in town and the city descriptions are absolutely useless.Following the lonely planet we missed some really very nice spots (as we found out later) and spent some nights in very sleazy B&Bs.;Every other travel guide will do a better job."
1,Horrible product,"This product broke within the first 5 minutes of using it. It is a terribly designed product. When you put in the batteries...first of all they don't tell you anywhere which way the batteries go in, and secondly the cap that your screwing on has the metal connectors on it for the batteries to touch. Its impossible to screw it on exactly right so that the batteries touch the conducting metal plates. It worked for five minutes and completely broke...messed with it for 1/2 an hour and couldn't get it to work. Threw it in the trash because it's not eligible for return. Wish I would have known that when I bought it."
1,CHEAP!!!!,"i paid thirty bucks for ths thing and it broke on the second use, I read alot of reviews on this n I shoulda listened because ths was a huge waste of money very cheaply made I couldn't imagine evn putting it in water. and as far as comfort goes I also think tht sucks too, it's super hard plastic like tha old school vibraters...save urself sum money and pick sumthn else"
5,Great tea!,"The first time I ever had this tea, I could not believe how delicious is was. I had only been exposed to southern style sweet tea (which I still love), and had decided to pick up a tin of the sunflower brand jasmine to try. It is so delicate and sweet -- just perfect! I have been a fan ever since and I am loyal to this brand.By the way, this IS real jasmine tea. The reviewer who said otherwise didn't read the description or label. It is a delicate tea, not overpowering, and steeps up beautifully as long as you don't steep too long (all green tea will become bitter if steeped too long or in water that is too hot). It really is tasty, with or without a dash of sweetener. With a drop or two of honey, it is heavenly! It also makes a yummy bubble tea, if you like that kind of thing."
5,The Best Jasmine Tea Ever,"I discovered this tea in San Francisco 35 years ago, and I have been faithful to it ever since. No other jasmine tea matches its caliber. I now live in a rural community, so shopping for this item is not easy. Thank you for offering it on Amazon."
1,very unhappy with taste of tea,very disappointed in the product. Like cheap tea you buy in the store without a hint of jasmine. No jasmine flowers in the container of tea.
3,Right Handed Maybe??,"These are great looking drawer or cabinet door pulls; on drawers they look fine!! The only comment I would have is they appear to be ""right handed"" and mounted on doors, really look out-of-place?? I would wonder if there are ""left handed"" ones?? Especially side-by-side on doors, they would look better??"
1,Cool Idea; Bad Follow-thru,"The actual pill holder mixes all the pills together, the ""timer"" is basically a stop watch that has to be reset each time, and as for ease of use, the little 'anti-pill-sling' deflector is dumb, unnecessary, and not meant for people with shaky or weak hands. It is both childproof, and adult proof."
1,We Want Season Sets,Smurfs cartoons remain a favorite for those people that grew up watching them as kids. We got the full treatment with Season One Vol 1 and 2 but now it seems like miscellaneous episodes in no particular orders are being put out a few at a time. Which WB associate made that irrational decision is an outrage. So the 1 star vote is for the DVD. We want season sets!
2,Okay,"As I have said in a previous Smurf DVD review, at least they included episodes with Gargamel. I am still disappointed with the limited episodes-5, and the fact that these releases are not in chronological order. What happened to the episode where Baby Smurf arrived via stork? I wish Warner Bros would stop playing and release another Volume of numerous episodes in the order that they originally aired."
1,$15 for 5 episodes????,"I agree with everyone else that believes these sets are overpriced. $15 for 5 episodes is just crazy. Don't any of the corporate folks read any of these reviews. If they don't, they should, because the might actually learn something they can't read in an academic journal."
1,"The Smurfs Season 2, Vol. 3: World of Wonders","When season 1 volumes 1 and 2 came out I was excited, purchased both, and had plans of purchasing the entire series. I was impressed with the quality and value of these two sets. When season 2 volume 1: True Blue Friends came out I could smell corporate greed immediately and have not purchased a Smurfs DVD since. I can not understand why anyone would waste their money on these low quality 5 episode DVDs."
2,Needs more smurfs.,"I love the smurfs, but they need to put more than 5 episodes on a disc. Also, these episodes really sucked (as did pretty much all of season 2). ""Squeaky"" had me in tears. Love, love, love smurfs; barely tolerate this selection of episodes."
1,Horrible DVD Release - Season Sets are Needed,"I wish I could give this zero stars just because it's that bad. Not the cartoon itself, that is 100 stars, but the DVD itself. I went out and within the first few days bought the Vol 1 & 2 for Season 1 and have not bought any since. Why would I want to waste my time buying something for x amount of dollars for a few episodes when I can pay the same amount before for half a season. Who do we need to contact to spread the word to say ""Season Sets"". The problem is with nobody buying these sets they will not release anymore DVD's. Oh well it's another great show that will not make it to DVD. :("
1,Worst Parton disc ever,"I bought this cd for one reason - I wanted a fresh copy of ""Turn Turn Turn"" which Parton recorded years ago and I had on a mix-tape a friend made for me. Even though I transferred it to cd, I wanted a clean new copy of that song. For some reason, I thought this would be it. WRONG! This banjo-mandolin-laden silly-sounding array of (here-to-fore) wonderful classics is the worst album Parton has ever produced and she should be ashamed. It's like she's some kind of plastic doll you wind up and it spews out the worst versions of beloved songs an arranger could possibly put together.I'm still looking for that early version of Turn Turn Turn, where she sounded like she actually listened to the words she was singing.If anyone knows how I can get that song on an mp3 or cd, let me know!Oh, and DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. Listening to 25 seconds of one song on Amazon.com might sound cute, but believe me, this cd gets old very very fast!"
2,Eeek!,"Expecting Dolly Parton's usual musical genius, I was disappointed to hear classic songs butchered. From a comical version of If I Were A Carpenter (Johnny Cash and June Carter) to a simply horrifying version of Imagine (John Lennon) I couldn't believe my ears didn't fall off."
3,Dolly-zation of classic song,"Those Were the Days is a mix of classic songs sung with a Dolly twang. Some of the songs, like ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" work, and sound great with Dolly's voice. Otheres arent that lucky. Dolly's version of Lennon's ""Imagine"" is a good attempt, but doesnt have Lennon's spirit."
1,Desappointed,"Dolly did these songs no favor. I generally enjoy her music, and I like the songs, however, for me, the two just don't mix. Doubt I will ever play it again."
4,Sure to please all Baby Boomers,"In this interesting album, Country Music legend Dolly Parton takes a collection of 1960s and `70s songs - mostly protest songs - that touched her heart, and remakes them, giving them her own personal touch. You get to hear Blowin' In The Wind and Where Have All The Flowers Gone played with a Bluegrass flair, and accompanied by Dolly's angelic voice.This is an album that is sure to please all Baby Boomers who do indeed remember Those Days."
5,Great Collection of Oldies,"This album starts with Dolly's wonderful rendition of Those Were the Days. She covers this song with all the pathos and spark of the original, yet makes it her own. Other highlights are The Cruel War, Twelfth of Never and If I Were a Carpenter.By the way, does anyone else, see a trend among these songs - so many of them deal (gently) with anti-war themes... dare I say it? But Dolly would never be as blatant about this as say the Dixie Chicks. She has too much class."
5,A goddess on Earth...,"Dolly could sing Happy Birthday and bring me to tears, but these powerful covers are an absolute joy. Her artistry shines here, and her expansive heart.Now if she would just do a collaboration with Bjork, I could die happy. (OK, I have strange musical fantasies.)"
1,Terrible.,"With the exception of Crimson and Clover, I have long loved all the songs on this CD. I also love Dolly Parton and was thrilled with my recent purchase of The Grass is Blue, so I thought, ""Dolly + good songs + collaboration w/ other musicians = great combo, right?"" Wrong. I'm sad to say Dolly did no credit to any of these songs; many sound campy and her ""I'm on the verge of tears"" style of singing on a lot of the tracks grows wearing fast. All these songs have wonderful, powerful lyrics that have endured for good reason--they don't need Dolly's oversentimentalizing."
3,Dolly Remembers The Days,"Dolly Parton is one of country music best songwriters, but on Those Were The Days, she covers her favorites from the 60's & 70's. Most of the songs come from the folk-rock area and many are protest songs. The songs fits the rootsy feel of her previous few album, although it does go towards the heavy bluegrass sound of those efforts. The best tracks are the ones that fit closer towards Ms. Parton's style like ""Me & Bobby McGee"", ""Both Sides Now"", ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone"" (with backup vocals by Norah Jones & Lee Ann Womack) and ""Where Do The Children Play"". ""Crimson & Clover"" doesn't really work nor does ""Imagine"" as Ms. Parton seems out of place singing it. But those are the only two real missteps on an otherwise appealing album."
2,Judge not a book by the cover,"I bought this book in a novelty store around Yosemite. I am quite familiar with notable literature, but try to buy and experience published literature out of the mainstream.Quite frankly, I bought the book because of the cover!I was intrigued by the beautifully pictured landscape of the Sierras which graces the cover. Intrigued by the story of two high school friends reuniting to backpack together after many years of silence provoked my interest.Unfortunately. the brautiful backdrop did not overcome the bland reunion of these colorless women. Their whining and meaningless memories left me void of any interest for their future relationship. Here were two people in a backdrop of glory and their concerns were legitimately dwarfed in my opinion.This is not a novel that will recharge you or make you feel the power of hiking in the Sierras.Don't waste your time trying to bring life to the passing.-"
5,Light up your life - read this book,"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I read a *lot* of books. Valerie Miner's prose reads like poetry and her characters are rich and complex. The book is about the friendship of two women who have been estranged for 25 years but were best friends growing up. They now find themselves alone together on what had been planned as a reunion camping trip with the gang of five girls who had been best pals in high school. Valerie Miner uses the California Sierras as almost another character and I felt like I could see, hear and smell exactly what she was describing. This is a book that engages your brain as well as all of your senses."
3,Please read this first !,"These tapes are designed to train professional teachers about variations and ideas of logic concepts, not the logic of teaching. It is based on logic of religion and religion in logic. The tapes are professionally done and well edited. If you teach logic classes I am sure you will be pleased with them."
2,"Not the worst movie, but...","In the 70's, disaster movies were really popular. But, unfortunately some were unavoidable. Case in point, ""The Bermuda Triangle."" This movie is boring and uninteresting. Maybe, I need to give it another view, but it takes a while before it builds up it's premise. John Huston was a highly respected actor. But movies like this one was probably all he could get. Not the worst movie, but if you have time on your hands, could be better spent elsewhere."
2,Just plain SOFT,"This product is simply useless. If you are considering this product and want any sort of support then DO NOT buy this cushion. It is too soft, too mushy, and lacks any level of support. Pay the money and purchase the $30+ one. I will be buying the better one with the hope that I will get the cushion that I need for relief."
2,Didn't offer much relief,"I had high hopes for this cushion, but it did not deliver. My tailbone pain is only mild, just annoying enough to distract me at work all day. So, I expected this to provide relief. I'm thinking the cushion is too soft and not tall enough to isolate the problem area. Not sure."
2,Not enough support,Product does not offer enough support to do the job it is supposed to do. I had to fold the cushion in half and secure with rubber bands to get any level of support. Not recommended.
1,I wouldn't buy this item again,I would have rated this NO STARS ..but it wouldn't take my review until I checked one. I bought this seat cushion based on the rather good reviews. I got mine and find it almost useless. It flattens out easily (and I'm quite slim) and offers no support or the help I had hoped. I should have spent more and gotten a MEMORY FOAM cushion.
3,Seat Cushion,This is a good price for this item. It is not very soft though. It does make an excellent cushion for sitting in grandstands.
2,Smells awful,"I received this product, opened the package and was sickened by the smell. Had to throw the product away. Purchased this type of product elsewhere."
5,The only history of a third of the Pacific War.,"A comprehensive history of the ""forgotten front"", Hutchison provides indepth information on all combatants; American, Japanese, Canadian and Russian. Internationally honored, the book describes details only available from distant archives from around the world. In this book these rare and disintegrating documents come together for the first time, and illuminate what occured in the frozen north. The north being the only active World War II theater, this book is a major achievment, and a must for any library."
1,read instead the &#65533;Autobiography of G. K. Chesterton&#65533;,"There's no new ground covered here, which is a major flaw for a work by an ""historian; moreover, the author's writing style is hackneyed, and that's in its most readable passages. Also, Chesterton was an Orthodox Catholic, where the author of this work is not - their perspectives are at polar ends. Chesterton probably would have been appalled to have such an adversary of the Church to be so bold as to write about his life.If you want to know Chesterton read his ""Autobiography of G. K. Chesterton""."
1,biased,"This work is written by a radical who opposes Church teachings. Wills allows his own opinions to influence his scholarship. See much better accounts by Chesterton himself, Ahlquist, or many other reliable biographers."
4,small book,"I read this book to a class of preschoolers years ago and it was a perfect addition to a unit about birds, following a unit about flowers. The best part to me was that the little boy in the story is posed with a sketch pad and paint brush about to draw the hummingbird in flight. At the end, we see that the picture he creates is an age-appropriate scribble depicting the flightpath of the tiny bird. When I read this book years ago the children remained engaged and it served as a good motivation for them to draw or paint the non-representational marks of a bird's flight. I think the main difference now was the tiny size of the board book. Even with only eight or so children, this book is just too small to grab their attention. Unfortunately, this was the only available copy. I'll try it with no more than two kids and I think that may go better."
5,Stretching,I love this book. The pictures are perfect and I love the fact that it reviews stretching for various activities and sports.
5,complete instructions that are easily understood,"This book not only demonstrates how to set up and paint pictures, but explains the reasons for the actions. Give a person a fish, and he/she will eat for today. Teach a person how to fish, and he/she will eat for the rest of his/her life."
5,The saga of THE HOMESTEAD is a respectable tale.,"1859-1921 KansasThis story is not what I would classify as a typical romance tale. It's a saga about one woman's life that's full of hardship intermixed with fleeting moments of happiness.The storyline is good and easy to follow, although somewhat bleak. Ms. Hermann's writing is clear and precise. You cannot help feeling Olivia's strife and it's not as cheery a read as I prefer, but the emotions it evokes is what makes it a five star read."
5,Your child can achieve his potential and here is the key.,"My son in fifth grade was receiving D's and E's despite reading on an 8th grade level. We had tried everything, bribery, threats, groundings, denial of field trips, removal of TV privileges and anything else you could think of. He simply ""forgot"" everything he was tasked with at home and at school. He even ""forgot"" to turn in homework that he had actually completed!! This book made me described how we could give him the tools to apply himself to get good grades and somewhat sceptically, I thought I had nothing to lose by trying it. BINGO. We've seen dramatic improvement in every area, not just schoolwork. There are still some ""slipbacks"" into old habits, but we're definitely on the right track to his achieving his potential. Thank You Dr Whitley."
5,"Finally, some direction","My husband and I have only just started implementing the suggestions in this book, but it is a relief to finally have some direction as to how to handle our 16-year-old son. I just wish we could have read this 5 years ago. After years of struggling and following teacher recommendations of consequences, planners for teachers to sign, and rewards--all to no avail; Dr. Whitley's approach puts the solution responsibilities back on the child. I can't say he particularly likes the process at this point, but it's not because we are angry or punishing. We are simply asking questions and Dr. Whitley says if they become irritated, ""take heart"" because that means we're hitting the right buttons. He compares the approach to Columbo and Mr. Rogers: caring, logical, inquiring. Even if it takes a long time to have the desired effect of better grades, at least we are not screaming at him and feel like we are acting more like we are on his side--which, of course, we always have been!"
3,Harder than it looks...,"Although the 10 steps outlined by Dr. Whitley seem clear, he doesn't spend enough time on strategies for overcoming the resistence and often strong anger that underachievers exhibit when their safety net starts moving away. As parent and teachers start to not respond to being blamed for everything and not rescueing, the anger that is unleashed by the underachiever can often be frightening.Some of the author's suggestions really need to be initiated and guided by an outside party-I found myself often responding to Dr. Whitley's steps-""I don't know how to do that"". I found that the charactersitics were helpful but I was really looking for more tools for the lay person."
4,Something for everyone - a good all round story,"This book takes the scare stories of global warming and the destruction caused by man and builds a believable and unpleasant picture of the furture. It also brings up the immortal story of good versus evil. There are children in the story, an evil witch, hero and heroine, a love story, something for everyone. An very good read!"
3,Proof is in the pudding,"The book has good information but is loaded with proof-reading errors. The book goes for a high price and I feel that more time should have been given to this. It would be much more professional and less ""cutesy""."
5,Passing The Flame: A Beadmaker's Guide to detail and design,"Corina Tettinger writes this book for your very first time behind the flame, explains the Lamp working terminology for the novice extremely well. Recommend this book to anyone who is in Lamp working its a brilliant Book."
5,One of the very best glass books out there !!,"I love this book!! It's has been with me since I started to lampwork over 1 year ago and I still refer to it. It caters to soft glass users telling you how to make all kinds of beads.Since there are no teachers out here in Hawaii that I know of,this is the one book that you could learn from. It teaches you from pulling stringers to encasing beads and everything in between, like the rainbow bead and cosmic swirl... It's like having a teacher right in your home.I mean the list goes on ! Not to mention the gorgeous beads she has in the book!! She even tells you to look around and hunt for color combinations. If it wasn't for her and the book Passing the Flame I would not have known where to begin.Now she has a chapter for passing a Flame and other publications and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!! if you ever thought about lampworking this book is a must."
5,Excellent- So full of Information-Easy to use,"This book made all the difference in my bead making. I have bought other books on the same subject, but with this one the light bulb finally went on. The manner in which Corina explains the techniques is so easy to understand, that I am able to follow the directions and make great beads!. This book is packed full of helpful tips, the illustrations are wonderful and easy to follow. I love the spiral binding, I can keep the book open for reference while working on a technique!"
3,Good beginners book,While I have been tinkering around with lampwork for about a year and have had a few classes this book is excellent reinforcement.Appreciate rapid shipment of the book.
5,The Absolute Best - The Beadmakers Bible,"Corina's book continues to be the best instruction for the beginning to intermediate lampwork beadmaker. I own dozens of books and each I continuously return to Passing the Flame for the basics. Not only does she explain clearly, she is a fun read too!"
5,A Must Have for Beadmakers!!,"Corina's book is the ""Bible for Beadmakers""! She shares her incredible beadmaking secrets with step-by-step instructions, wonderful photographs, helpful hints, and a good bit of dog humor. :-) If I had had this book when I started making beads, I would be much farther along than I am now. As it is, this book will keep me going for years. Thanks, Corina!"
5,"Corina's beautiful, fabulous beadmaker's guide!!","Corina's book, Passing the Flame, is such a gorgeous book, and it is beautifully written. The pictures are great (and there are hundreds), her style of writing is very easy to understand, and the instructions are easy to follow. I love flipping it open, and trying whatever technique I see first. Although it is easy to look up a certain technique as well.Corina's charm and wit really come through in her writing, and I really enjoy the feeling that I get from the book that she is actually talking to me.I think that this book has a lot of eye candy for even non-beadmakers!"
5,Worth its weight in gold!,"No, it is not inexpensive. But, I'll tell you... it is the BEST use of $75 for beginning and intermediate lampworkers. FULL color pages, EXCELLENT description of technique, and GREAT photos to show you exactly how to do it!Just some topics covered:- Safety- pulling stringer- making a basic bead- encasing- applying dots- Silvered Ivory Stringer (SIS)- Shapes (cone, bicone, hearts, cube)- discussion on different colors- discussion of some the ""business"" sides of lampworkingOverall, I just can't rave enough about this book! Her ""Spotlight On..."" series are great, as well! VERY Informative!"
4,A great translation of a timeless classic,"A brilliant translation of one of Euripides' finest, excellently capturing the mood and spirit of the text. A prose translation, Rudall's effort has done great service to Euripides. The characterisations are good, and the language is almost always fluid and idiomatic, with only a few clumsy exceptions. Excellent!"
3,Fennel,"It is suppose to help against bath breathe. Like most supplements, it is only as good as the consistency of its use."
3,Overwrought with financial details,"When I bought the book I was hoping this would be another classic like the Great Bridge by David McCullough. No way. It's a shame too as the Chunnel project was as great an engineering feat for our time as the Brooklyn Bridge was in its. The book, for me, was overwhelming in its details of who did what when, and mostly then it focusses primarily on the financial and political aspects of the project. It might make a good reference book, but unless your hobby is financing mammoth engineering projects, it is pretty grim.The Chunnel has to be one of the most interesting and exciting engineering projects of the second half of the 20th Century and here it is just one big yawn.David McCullough, we have a new project for you."
3,Interesting Story but a Confusing Telling,"Fetherson delivers the history of the chunnel from the earliest days of wishful thinking to its completion. He covers both the engineering and the politics of this great project. I was fascinated by the engineering but depressed by the politics. Unfortunately, there were so many people mentioned in the book that I could not remember all of them which greatly detracted from my ability to understand all the machinations."
5,Great Book for a Chorus Member,"This is the most widley used book and not that expensive so Isuggest if you are in the show and don't have a huge part, (ie theChorus) to use this book. It is easy to read and has all of the samethings as most of the others, I just got done using it and was verypleased."
2,Beware!,"The musical qualities of this score do not overly impress in themselves, but the really important thing is ... despite what other reviewers may attest ... and it was on account of those reviews that I bought this score ... IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ONE SINGLE WORD OF DIALOGUE!!! Which makes it, for me, useless, and obliges me to buy a different edition. So, beware ... if you are preparing a ROLE in this wonderful operetta, this is NOT the score for you!"
5,flushed my problems away,"at first i thought i was going to have problems finding itI called around it was going to cost alot and take a fews weeks to getso i went to Amazon found the part, it shipped to me within a week.this job was too easy, Amazon made it too easyfrom purchasing the part to installing it.thx, Amazonregards,Charlie"
1,"review of bob dylan dvd ""Don't look Back""","I was VERY disappointed with the production quality. Most of the time I could not understand the words to the songs or what was being said by the people. Iwas expecting early taping quality, but I still expected to get some good footage of the concerts and songs. I have yet to get thru the entire dvd....I just can not endure it."
1,"Rating is for FORMAT, not quality of performance","HEADS UP, people!When my copy arrived it was PAL format - the EUROPEAN format - and it wouldn't play in my DVD player.After checking the product description - it says NTSC - I returned the item at NO CHARGE and my money was promptly refunded by the seller, but I wouldn't have ordered it in the first place if I knew it was an OUT OF REGION format.Some new players out there will now have no problem reading these discs in PAL format, but you'd better check your player's specs before ordering."
3,Nice umbrella but the lights didn't work,"This is a nice umbrella. It is sturdy, a nice neutral color. It bends so you can shade yourself from the sun at various times of day. I didn't get it because it had lights inside it, which was a good thing because the lights never worked."
1,lights out!!,"I've had the umbrella for 4 days. The lights worked just fine the 3 times I turned them on. Today when I turned them on, they stayed on for about 1 second then quit completely. I should have gotten just a plain umbrella."
2,Not Solar Powered,"This is not a 'SOLAR POWERED' item. Ordered it from a search of ""solar umbrella"" and did not realize it was not solar powered as were the other 100 items on the list. Fabric is quite sheer, not exactly see through but nothing close to canvas as I have experienced with other market umbrellas."
2,"FYI: understand ""canvas"" before you buy","I read the other reviews and looked at the pictures before I ordered this umbrella. Seemed OK.However, what was not reviewed was the fabric of the umbrella- the ""canvas.""To me, the common understanding of the word ""canvas"" is a heavier weight cotton or cotton blend- a durable fabric. The fabric on the umbrella I received was like thin nylon. Most disappointing. I returned the umbrella.I think the product description should be corrected for a truer understanding by the shopperbefore deciding to order."
3,"Nice features, poor construction",Fine product if you plan on using it one season. Mine had the rope that opens it either break or become untied. I haven't checked it out to see if easily fixed yet. Season over and in storage now. But the lights are really cool but just on off would have been fine too without the strobe effect.
1,Umbrella did not open,"The umbrella was defective and broken when i received it. The first time i tried to open the umbrella, it would not open with the crank. I agree with the comments related to the quality and look of the material on the canopy as it did seem like a cheap plastic like material versus a nice cloth one that i expected. The one positive is that Amazon allowed me top return it with no issues and no cost to return it. I definitely do not recommend the umbrella as the quality seems lacking."
4,FLEW IN MY POOL AND STILL WORKS HAHAH,Pretty decent for the price and lights up! Didnt ever charge and work with out plugging in but plugged them in a few time! Ok but could have had a better light and temp gage but for the price I can not complain!!!
4,Good for price,Was exactly as I expected. It is a high quality aluminum pole umbrella. Opens very wide and stands very tall. Has a bit of a narrow pole. Since it is aluminum you need to make sure it is anchored to a secure base.
1,NO STAND!,Why would you show a stand in the picture and not include one? Also looks like it would not last long. Returning.
1,Not well made,"I purchased three of these, I learned they need to be plugged in...the ones I had did not require that. Also, a mild wind storm and one of the arms fell off.....now I keep these umbrella's closed unless I am home and I can see there is no wind."
4,Tropilight LED Umbrella,The umbrella is like all others but the LED lights give off a good amount of light and the bugs are not attracted to the amber color.
4,Decent Deal,LEDs weren't seated properly on ours but they seemed to pop back in fine. Other than that good construction quality.
4,Good Value,"I like this umbrella, it's sturdy, of good size, and priced right. The mechanism to raise and collapse it seems solid. I'm not sure but what the light-colored fabric is destined to be stained by damp leaves in the autumn.What I'm still trying to figure out is the lights -- yeah, they work, and they're a relatively pleasant color, but the adapter says ""Indoor Use Only."" I suppose I could set up the umbrella in my living room..."
3,I hope I am wrong,"I normally buy my outdoor furniture at the end of the season when I can get high quality merchandise at bargain basement prices. However, last fall I failed to notice that my umbrella needed to be replaced. As a result, this spring I had to decide whether to buy an umbrella or spend the summer listening to my wife complain about not having shade at the patio table. I chose to bite the bullet and spend the bucks.I purchased this umbrella because of the positive reviews, the relative low cost, and the lights. My high expectations were dashed when I actually received the item. In particular I'm very concerned and disappointed in the quality of the umbrella. I will be very surprised if it lasts more than a season. I hope I'm wrong."
2,"Nice pictures, difficult to follow and there are errors","I decided to check this out of the library before purchasing and I'm really glad I did. Found several errors, including a major one on my favorite pattern, the bobbles and vines. Found the descriptions at times difficult to follow. Would have been easier to follow a chart.My interest was in the lace patterns and this for me was disappointing. Did not really focus on the other chapters but perhaps for some those would be useful.I do love the yarns they chose."
4,Vogue!!,I had no idea how many things I could do just with plain old knit and purl... I'm very impressed!
5,"If you like to knit patterns/textures, this book is incredible!","I love to create patterns when I knit, so this book literally had me drooling by the 2nd page. It is unbelieveable how many patterns there are. The photos are great, and so far, I haven't run into any errors in the patterns. PLUS! I really like the fact that there are lots of simple patterns as well as advanced patterns."
2,Where are the charts?,"The blurb for this book states that it includes charts, but my copy has only written instructions. What happened to the charts? I'd be more inclined to use this book if I could SEE how the stitch patterns are formed. I'll also think twice about buying Volume 2 (cables) when it comes out in May if it only has written instructions.What a disappointment. Vogue Knitting was a pioneer of charts for knitting patterns way back in the 80's. I expected better."
2,No charts - What were they thinking?,"The patterns in this book are beautiful, but they're useless to me because they don't have charts. I've never seen a book of this type without charts.They should have used bigger needles for the lace patterns - many of the patterns were hard to see."
4,Pretty good reference,"This book has a wide variety of stitches, but is far from being a complete stitch library. It is a good reference and introduction to simple knit and purl patterns, laces, etc. The pictures show the pattern very clearly, and it is nice to be able to compare one stitch to another using the same yarn. It would be nice, however, if the authors had included some more editorial comments about the stitches (which stitches work well with which yarn weights, etc.) There is no information about that whatsoever. The book simply shows a swatch and gives the written directions. I have found it very useful and inspiring in creating my own patterns/pieces."
4,Good book better then the usual,"I have read a few books on the drilling topic. Some are too much of an overview with no details. This book is a god balance of detail, while still keeping this straight forward enough to fallow."
4,Every Real Train Set Needs a Tunnel,"Like so many others, I bought the Mountain Tunnel Accessory Set to go with my son's large Melissa and Doug train set. Working the mountain into the layout did take some thought while I was setting up, but I was eventually able to make it fit with a minimum of fuss. It is a high quality piece of color molded plastic that looks quite at home with a high quality wooden railway. No one, in my opinion, would think that it was out of place.The downside is, as others have pointed out, the height of the tunnels. Some of our taller engines and cars will not go through. As a result, we often use the train set without the top part of the hill - which thanks to clever design work on the part of the manufacturer makes the set look like it is running over the top of the mountain.Overall, I am pleased with the Mountain Tunnel Accessory Set and think it is a worthy addition to our railway set."
1,Not compatible with Chuggington trains!,"I bought this based on the good reviews. The product seems durable and will probably stand up to my 2 year old. However, I bought this trying to find a tunnel that would fit Chuggington trains. They are a little bit larger than the Thomas engines and don't fit under the Thomas bridges, etc. This one said it was compatible with other wooden track sets, BUT IT STILL DOESN'T WORK WITH THE CHUGGINGTON ENGINES AND CARS!!! Therefore, I am giving it a low rating."
3,A little high price,"We got this for our son realizing that it only came with a few pieces but I guess after getting it and thinking about it, realized it wasn't worth as much as we paid. Although it's a nice toy, its a little pricey for what you get."
2,Permated 95140 dispenser,"I bought one of these thinking it would be good for dispensing the cream hand cleaner. Like the other review said, with the 4.5 lb container (standard) the tub just basically sits on top of it. It appears there is a provision for retaining a larger container, but I have yet to find one.With aggressive pumping of the dispenser, the container can just fall off to the side due to no real provision to attach it to the dispenser.I am buying a GoJo dispenser because it got good review and appears it was designed for the 4.5 lb container."
4,Solid foundation in distance learning,"The book is very appropriate for a text in a distance learning class. It covers a wide range of topics - definitions, history, instructional design, student characteristics, student assessment, program evaluation, and copyright. Chapters include a summary and self-assessment questions. The book has an academic slant, which gives students a foundation in theory and research. This also means some do not find it an easy read. The book does not have much depth on the instructional technologies themselves."
2,Redundant,"This book has some good information but is very drawn out. I have to read it for a graduate class, otherwise I don't think I would continue with it."
1,This book is required reading for a graduate course.,It is uninspiring and I dread the reading assignments. It is so outdated there is actually a black and white illustration of how someone uses a mailbox! Format is boring. Information often outdated (even though the book has updates). I'd like to the tell publishers and writers to stop resting on your past accomplishments and create something inspiring as graduate courses should be.
2,Does not make use of kindle,The book did not make use of the kindle reader feature. More disappointingly it does not work on my smart phone's kindle app. Moreover it was really expensive compared to my other textbooks on kindle. Really a big step down.It is ironic that an e book on e learning is so inconveniently formatted for e reading
2,The Encyclopedia of Planting Combinations,"I could not wait for this book to arrive, but when it did I was very disappointed. The pictures were beautiful, but it was very difficult to navigate. I do not consider myself an expert gardener, but I have been creating flower beds for the past 30 years, and have many garden design books. I found this book to be very time consuming as well as confusing if you are not well versed on botanical names."
5,I love her!!!,"I love everything she writes. Ellie Kay is wonderful, humerous, practical, engaging and a real find.I feel like she is a close friend who helps me get through the day. I have gained so much from her advice.I know this sounds gushy, but I can't overstate how her work has helped me."
5,The Dominoes: Greatest Early R & B,"These are the Dominoes with Clyde McPhatter singing lead. At this time McPhatter had the most fascinating voice in all of R & B. It ranges far and wide, it quivers, hovering on the brink of 'cracking' or failing, only to turn back on itself to reach new heights. Moreover, the passion with which McPhatter sings permeates every note. Too bad the great Clyde McPhatter is not still with us. But we have these songs! A must for every lover of R & B. Essential. Michael DeArmey."
1,horrible for the price,this train is of very poor quality. I would prefer a wind-up train to this... we've had to replace the batteries at least 3 times in a couple of days. Even with fresh batteries the engine is so weak it can't even get up a tiny incline by itself let alone with a load attached... it also moves very slow.to replace the battery for the motor you need to have a really small screw driver and its completely ridiculous that this company assumes everyone has one of those.no wonder it was on sale.. I paid $16.99 and had I tested this in a store I would have surely passed!
4,Red Motorized Engine,Works good and my son loves playing with it on his wooden train track. The sound it good and runs well.
4,Good toy with definite pros and cons,"Overall, this is a good value and I do recommend it. There are definite strong points and weak points to point out:+ Strong pulling power: makes it up a steep uphill incline with three cars attached.+ Price: got this for half the price of some more expensive Brio models.- Poor switch mechanism: uses a slider bar that you push one way for forwards, the other way to go backwards, while the center position is the off position. This switch requires a little too much finesse for a little one, especially compared to the simpler mechanism found on the Brio motorized locomotives.- No auto shut-off: if left on it will consume the battery in hours (much faster consumption than Brio trains)."
2,Red Engine,"My boy was excited about this little red engine, but now he could care less. It does not work. It runs really slow. There is no pulling power. He has abused a used Brio locomotive and it still runs amazingly. So, spend a little extra money and purchase a Brio."
5,Delta In2ition Handheld Shower,"This is the best shower head I have ever had. When my husband installed it, he took a shower and he told me how great it felt. I took one then and I did not want to get out it felt so good. So much water comes out it is so easy to rinse your hair. The different massage settings are not that great, but I like to leave it on full anyway so that doesn't bother me at all. Love this product and recommend it highly."
3,Doesn't hold up,"When first installed the shower head would stay in whatever position it was rotated. Now, after two week of use, it just point to the floor and won't maintain it's position...very frustrating."
3,Going Down For the Third Time,"Was it that I wasn't paying attention? Or was it that this Colin Dexter novel just wasn't as well written as his others? An avid Inspector Morse fan (to the extent of visiting the sites of several of his books in Oxford) I struggled with this one. A very clever double identity premise is doubled again. Then redoubled? I'm not sure. I got lost in the middle and by the time I turned the last page I just shook my head. Despite my going down for the third time on this one, I continue to enjoy the irascible Morse and the ploddingly faithful Lewis. And of course I'll read the next Colin Dexter."
2,"Good start, poor execution.","Twin brothers, a fifty year old grievance, and an anagram set the stage for another adventure with Chief Inspector Morse. A good start, but the rush to the conclusion in the last two chapters causes the otherwise intriguing story line to collaspe into a shambles. A poor performance by Colin Dexter ruins a potentially good book."
4,Captivating pageturner!,"The reader always hopes that the next page will reveal more intriguing information than the last, and it usualy do'es. Dexter has created a fascinating character in Inspector Morse. However have a dictionary handy when reading all or any of Dexters works, words such as Dolichocepholic, Sinistrality and what about Nigritude. I actualy think they add to the fascination of the storyline. A book well worth reading. but not in short bursts."
5,H*llfire and Salivation,"One taste of Biker Billy's smoky ""Pita Pockets in Pain"" and I'm singing in his choir...It's a great cookbook -- well-written, informative, and informal (obviously!). Meat-lovers simply won't notice that it's a vegetarian cookbook: the flavors, textures and fire make every recipe I've tried memorable."
5,Love It,"I have this cook book and I love it so I bought one for a Christmas gift. Came right away, it looks like brand new and I would order from them again."
3,Great game of the casino game,I bought this Monopoly game because they are in the casinos in Las Vegas. So instead of playing with money I thought I would buy the handheld version of it. It is good though the real sounds of the ding ding ding and many other various sound effects. My favorite part is where you go along the board collecting points. but all you do in the game is collect points and keep collecting until it gets boring. Sometimes it does get boring just losing but when you do win it is exiting. I would say this game is great.
3,"Good content, but print quality suffers","The content is fine, I enjoyed it. However, the print quality is not so good. In some places it looks like a copy of a copy, the text is hard to decipher and the visuals are unclear. Recommended for fans of his other work, but maybe not a good place to start."
4,long out of print,"Dover has done historians and students of mathematics a favour by publishing this long out of print text, from 1917. It was a seminal study of how mathematics developed in the ancient world. Cajori focused on the classical realm of the Mediterranean world. But then also in more recent times, when Europe was in its Dark Ages. He explains how the Arabs and Indians gave their contributions. Especially the role of the Arabs in, albeit inadvertantly, nurturing the maths knowledge painfully accrued in past millenia.Unlike recent texts, there are no snazzy diagrams or whatnot to enliven the narrative. Figures in books were very expensive to arrange in the 1910s. But the writing itself remains lucid."
4,"Exciting, suspenseful, but an eerie feeling of deja vu","I enjoyed this book, like all of Griffin's war and soldier's stories, immensely. Nevertheless, there is a nagging feeling that we have met these people before. At least partially, the characters seem to be very similar in background and motivation from the ""Corps"" series, which all fans of Griffin hope will be continued (PLEASE!). Or is it the other way around? Where the characters in ""Corps"" derived from this book? With this continuous changing of pseudonyms, who can tell? But I don't want to nag, I love Griffin's books!"
2,Petey's bookies,"I love Griffin's military books but this story just plain drags. I am a little over 50% in it's reading and I'm not certain I will continue.. An aeronautical engineer or perhaps an accomplished pilot might like the details of a specific aircraft and it's workings but to me, it was either a show off litany or a filler for the author. Perhaps now that the two pilots are in China, the story may pick up a little. I'll give it a few more pages..."
1,"Boring, misleading, too long, & anticlimatic","The last heroes is not what the back cover implies it is: a WWII action/spy book. It turns out to be the total opposite. A big bore. I agree with a previous reviewer's comments about too much intimate encounters of the main characters. Oh, and way too many characters' names to keep track of. 80% of them non-essential to plot. Affairs and adultery run amuck. The actual main mission doesn't start until around page 350 and last for about 20 pages. I also realize that setting up a mission of that sort requires a lot of preparatory work, but this was ridiculous. The book runs 384 pages and 75% of it is wasted on establishing the 2 first main characters absurd and imature personalites. As some might know, it a Men At War series of books, which I will not continue to follow. Save yourself some time and read something better and real, like To Hell And Back or Beyond Valor."
4,"Good Griffin, Bad Publisher","While I will wholeheartedly agree with the complaints against Berkley for skirting the issue that this is a re-release of an older paperback series in hardcover, I will not agree with most of the complaints about the series -- I have read all four of them in paperback and have been hoping that Griffin will continue the series. The only similarity to the ""Argentina"" series (only two titles thus far) is that it is OSS-based. This is not a rich kid, poor kid combination, as claimed -- it is three rich kids and a middle-class kid (and that's only the male characters) and there is no overlap of venue between the incidents in these books and those in his other titles except the expedition to the Philippines in the fourth title of Men at War (The Fighting Agents) and the seventh Corps title (Behind the Lines). W.E.B. -- keep it up, your books are right at the top of my favorites list."
5,Thrill a minute,"I have read everything W.E.B. Griffin has published. I must say that I am disappointed in his publisher for re-releasing old books as if they were new. This is a very good tale of how things may have been leading up to Pearl Harbor. The only negative thing I have to say about it is it sounds vary familiar. I have stated in the past and will do so again, Mr. Griffin needs to expand his basic character base. We seem to always have the rich kid, the poor kid, and the wealthy parents and in-laws. I want to read about two guys that don't have a trust fund. THis book is worth reading if you are a fan of Griffin"
3,Pretty Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book. Who could screw up a book with prop driven fighters, devil may care flyboys, pretty women, the OSS and the Flying Tigers? WEB can. And worse, it doesn't end, it just stops...."
4,I like Griffin. His Protagonists are always heroes.,"I think I have read this series in paperback. He was writing under the pseudonym, Alex Baldwin. I was frustrated because he left me high and dry after the fourth book in the series. Maybe now he will finish the series."
3,Pretty good Griffin - not the best,"I am a big fan and I thought I had read all that Mr. Griffin had written, until ""Last Heros."" I bought it from Amazon on the first day it was available and read it with interest. A fair and predictable work.My big complaint is that it was published as a new work. In doing some research, I discovered it had been published years ago and just dressed up as new. W.E.B., you should consider and new and more honest publisher.We are anxiously awaiting the next in the ""Corps"" series."
2,A lot about nothing - you keep reading hoping for action.,"I must agree with the reader from Slidell, LA. This book is not at all like prior Griffin novels. There was little to no action, intrigue, or suspense. I guess that there are more books coming in this series. There must be as this one never had much going for it or even an ending. After reading most if not all of his prior works, this was a great disappointment."
2,Boring!,This book is barely readable. I was extremely dissappointed. For every five pages of sexual innuendo there is about 1 page of plot. I could hardly stay awake. I expected a lot more from Mr. Griffin. I will not be spending any more money on this series. Mr. Griffin should spend more time finishing the series that he has started rather than coming out with more series.
4,"Good read, but . . .","Griffin has been one of my favorite authors for over ten years, and I've read other books of the same genre. One thing to note about this particular series is that the books were all written over a decade ago (under a psuedonym), but the publisher is promoting the books as ""new"" now that Griffin is revealed as the author. Still, an enjoyable window into the formation of the OSS/CIA -- before it was corrupted in its mission in the Fifties."
5,Beware of ANY book by Griffin,"This novel is just another example of the uncanny ability of W.E.B. Griffin to draw excitement and interest out of a story many times told. But beware, as with all of his other novels, reading this book may be harmful if you need to sleep and eat on a regular basis. Once started, you can't put this down!!!!!"
5,Pure W.E.B. from front to back.,"I have read all of Griffins books. His ""Brotherhood of war"" series is still my favorite,followed by ""The Corps"". This series maybe a re-release,but it is still pure W.E.B.. Sure the players appear the same. Thats what makes it good. You know that you are reading Griffin. The money angle of the actors is great and different. Please another in "" Badge of Honor"" series. As with all of Griffins books,I can't put them down until I close the back cover."
3,Action seems just over the horizon and then plumments.,"I like WEB Griffin. No other author recognizes fully the fighting man of war as this one does. I enjoyed this book. He makes characters come alive and it is the characters that kept the story moving. Suspense built toward what should have been fine action and, then....it seemed that the action portion was summed up in a paragraph and we moved back to the characters. That being said; the book is well worth reading and I, for one, will follow the series just to find out how they resolve the cover story of one of the protagonists that he was a coward who had to be thrown out of the Flying Tigers. WEB Griffin (Alex Baldwin) or whoever you are... My respects for taking care of the military members. I give this one 3 stars in comparison to most of his 4 star books."
4,Practical guide for building a fireplace surround,I picked up several books on mantel & surround design in preparation for a DIY project. The best chapters here are on actual construction with detailed directions and photos (about 90 pages of 200 total). Anyone with reasonable woodworking skills should be able to follow the plans. The rest of the book covers design basics and a gallery of various surrounds for inspiration. Quite a bit of useful information for the price.
2,Making Mantels,Not a well written or informative text on the construction of mantels. Styles are simplistic & out dated.
3,"One note, but very funny *on* that one note","I remember the columns fondly, so I was really looking forward to the book. My problem is that I found I could *not* read it at one sitting and still find it funny precisely because it is essentially the same joke over and over. But if you read it a chapter (column) at a time, you can enjoy the whole book."
4,The Book of Masonry Stoves: Rediscovering an Old Way of Warming,very detailed and informative to the old ways and the forgotten ways but no real how to info but very good read
3,could have been better.....,"After reading through this book I was left somewhat disapointed. What is covered in the book is well written, but the publication date was nearly 20 yrs ago, and the book needs updating. More actual pictures of masonry heaters and less old pictures would be helpful. One is better off visiting the masonry heater associationhttp://www.mha-net.org/ to look at their collection of titles."
4,The book of Masonry Stoves,Extremely interesting. Would love to build one but our old house doesn't quite lend itself to this type of structure.
4,Excellent paddle set,I've used several other paddle sets but these are the best. This design has the most intuitive 'water ergonomics' and they feel like a second set of hands to me.Only drawback are the rubber straps that break after a few months. Poor design although Speedo includes replacement straps in the package.
3,Too big for beginners,These were the first paddles I ever tried and they seem to be too wide for me. They are probably good for advanced swimmers but for your first pair it is better to try something smaller and perhaps contoured to your hand.
3,Didn't get exactly the same item,I bought the paddle with strip grips but I got a one with rubber wires. Also the color was red instead of yellow. Color matters less but rubber wires are a bit annoying (just a matter of preference).It was not a big enough deal for me to return the paddle so I kept it. But still would have preferred to receive what I ordered.
3,Bad Transfer Of Wonderful Movie,"I own both the VHS and now the DVD copy of The Glenn MillerStory. The VHS copy is flawless but does not have the sound quality of the DVD.The DVD copy is cut off at the top and bottom in order to make it a widescreen movie. As we all should know by now, there were no Widescreen movies before 1955.Now lets get to that old thing of Picture Quality. The VHS copy was taken from the original negative and is in perfect condition. The DVD copy blurs on both sides from time to time. More times than not. There are also red vertical lines around all the images in almost the entire picture.Please don't get me wrong. The is a SUPER movie in all respects. Why in the devil Universal would put out such a classic movie with this bad picture quality is beyond me."
3,Chinese Writing a Disappointment,"This is one my my mother's favorite movies and I was happy to see it on DVD. However, she was not pleased with the Chinese writing on the DVD."
3,Incompatable,"Delivery service was great however, I then found I could not play DVD on my TV. We had to watch it through the computer which tells me I can only change the format a limited number of times?Wonder if it is possible to order DVD's which are compatable with UK TV format?"
2,Glen Miller Story,DVD received on ime and in good codition.Played well. Very saTISFIED.THANK YOU5 STAR.
5,Foot tapper,Loved the story line wonderfull music of a time when I think music was music. Both James Stewart and June Allyson worked well as a team and the support actors bought it all togeather.
5,TRUE to LIFE,"I only watch true stories, documentaries, biographies and autobiographies. The movie is just like I imagined his life to be and the music...out of sight!!!"
5,Just as I remembered!,I had to share this video with my mom for Christmas as this is one of my earliest memories from my childhood. I remember watching it on TV and my mother humming the music for days afterwards. I was excited to find the title!
5,What a classic!,"Even though I'm 25 I share an interest in all music...whether that's classical, christian, country, rock, rap, heavy metal or big band! This video is worthy of every penny you spend for it! The story line is well thought out and the details are as accurate as they could be. This is a must for everyone to watch! I would recommend this movie for anyone on a week night, weekend or a holiday so sit back, put your feet up, relax and let Glenn Miller take you away!"
5,Great Story...,Superb family entertainment with some of Hollywoods great Golden Era Stars... A story especially great for kids who are taking music lessons. Phenomenally told and will enjoy over and over again.
5,i love glen millers music,"i was so happy to recieve this movie,its very rarely shown on tv,i own my own thanks to amazon. the music in this movie is magnificent it's something to treasure for a life time .glen miller was a great composer ,one of my favorites is moonlight serenade ,they just cant make music like this any more ,this is a great movie to add to your collection. thank you amazon"
5,The Old Stuff still gets you going!,"I first saw this movie with James Stewart about 2 years ago. Being a young man who only new Mr. Stewart from It's A Wonderful Life, I was absolutely engulfed in this movie about one of my favorite artists- Glenn Miller. If you love music, if you love the work of Stewart, and/or if you want some original entertainment, this is a movie that you should add to your collection."
1,BEWARE!!!,"BEWARE! Please note you need a special DVD player to play DVDs from this seller. All DVDs require an INTERNATIONAL DVD player!!!! I overlooked this fact. Seller was honorable to accept return, but i would have lost half of DVD cost in restocking fees and return shipment costs. DVD was in good shape and if you have international player you should be fine!!"
4,"Not the real Miller, but that's okay.","By all accounts, Glenn Miller was not nearly so engaging and charming a personality as that portrayed by Jimmy Stewart. The problem with that fact is that it's hard to make a movie about a guy who was just a hard-working, hard-nosed, but bland bandleader. Solution: create a work of extreme fiction, centered around a search for ""the sound"" that would make Miller and his band famous. Of course that's nonsense; he had the basic clarinet/saxophone sound well before he became famous.But no matter; even though the plot is a fabrication, it still makes an enjoyable movie. Stewart and Allison are likeable, and the music is excellent. Highlights: the scene where Miller arranges ""Moonlight Serenade"" using ""the sound"" and the instruments are added one by one, as he writes down the notes, until the full, beautiful score fills the soundtrack; and the wartime performance of ""In the Mood"" punctuated by the buzz bomb attack. Great stuff."
5,A great movie!,Fans of the big band sound will love this one. Lots of music and Jimmy Stewart is awesome as Glenn Miller.
4,"the ""Glenn Miller story"" movie on DVD","I gave this purchase a four star rating. 4 stars for the DVD, no star for the booklet. There is none. Otherwise five stars. A perfect romantized version of the Glenn Miller bio. Putting his life in the right perspective, WWII days. Glenn Miller's life was all about music, and the music on this DVD is great. Really well played by the orchestra, and a good sound quality. And the Glenn Miller story is packed with stars. Both movie stars and music stars. When you enjoy the music of Glenn Miller, or have an interest in his life and the days he lived in, this is a good DVD to buy."
1,blue's clues,I can't really rate this product because I wanted a DVD for my child to watch on television and this was some sort of video game. I guess that would be my oversight but still made me mad that I didn't catch that detail when ordering.
2,Not my favorite,"Having enjoyed listening to Marco's albums for a couple years now I must say that ""Uscita di Sicurezza"" is my least favorite album in addition to ""Scimmie"". Italians might give this album a higher rating because the song texts are still very good. However, those who buy Marco's albums for his melodic tunes more so than for the actual song texts might be disappointed. ""Uscita di Sicurezza"" lacks the great melodic tunes featured on most of Marco's previous albums. Peccato..."
3,More essential than you would think,"Essential music from this forgotton pioneer in country music harmonica. Lots of boogie music. Don't let the cover fool you, this is hard driving country music, not hill music. This would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if there were any notes, song info, recording dates, or a better cover. This should have been treated more seriously."
3,Love this Cd,This cd is very good. The selections are good and the pianist's interpretation of the music is very good. The music is relaxing and is a must for Ponce fans.
5,Outstanding phone!,"I have owned a lot of speaker phones, and this is the best. The handset speaker phone is so good that no one can tell I am using a speaker phone. The extra features: custom ringing, call waiting call waiting and message alerts are especially nice."
4,One Gripe,"Great phone from the perspective of features and clarity, ergonomics. The only gripe is that the range is kind of pathetic. I had a 2.4GHz Panasonic before this one that beat its pants off for range. Might have something to do with the fact that it has no antenna on the phone or the base unit. Do these guys test their stuff? I thought 5.8 would actually have better range.One other idiotic aspect I just realized. When someone calls you, caller id shows their number, complete w/area code of course. If you try and just dial from the caller id list, the phone is too stupid to put the one in front. This is also a big nuisance when you go to store the numbers.Turns out there's a simple solution to the above problem: press the * key and it puts a one in front of the #."
2,So close yet so far,"This phone had everything we wanted and more....speakerphone on both the base and handsets, the shareable phonebook, the baby monitor, the walkie talkie feature - yup it's loaded. Uniden forgot one thing: make the phone work. It's a minor thing you know, actually using the phone to make and listen to phone calls, but the core function of this product just didn't work. Our callers thought we sounded fuzzy, indistinct, and far away. The phone kept hanging up, three times on one call in 5 minutes was the record. When we switched to a 15 year old corded phone, a caller commented how much better the phone sounded.This might be a product of the technology, that 5.8 ghz just isn't ready for true telephony, but we returned our system today. It's too bad too, I really wanted it to work out.Save your money and don't buy this if you plan to make phone calls."
1,Very Poor Range,"I live in an 860 sq. ft. apartment, and the reception cuts in and out when I am on the opposite side of the apartment versus the base. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
2,I have serious range issues,"I was used to the Panasonic GigaRange phones and I should have purchased that, but I didn't because I already have a 2.4 network running here.So... I got these thinking that the 5.8 would be plenty to spread across the home, even purchased a few extra base units. Sadly, it only works in the very room the base is in, all the other rooms it is spotty and difficult to have a conversation.I called Uniden tech support and they were far less than helpful, saying that the house was interfering with the signal. I even informed them that the wireless network had connectivity in ALL sections of the house, even out towards the pool and that I couldn't even use the phone out in the hallway outside my room!I'd not recommend this phone for anyone who wants range on the cordless, but if it's a small apartment or single room office, that's perfect!Now I gotta find out how to return this thing and get something that'll work."
1,WORTHLESS....,"I purchased this phone because it is exapandable and you can add up to 100 entries into the phone book. WHAT A JOKE!!! I have two handsets and each holds only 37 entries. 1 week after purchase the writing on the buttons started to wear off. When you try to dial a number that's on the caller id, it doesn't automatically add the 1 in front of the number. I'll never purchase another Uniden ever again. It also loses its connection to the base so you have to unplug it then reconnect it for it to work again. It's worthless!"
5,my wife loves it.,"She has almost worn out her original one that she has had for 10 plus years, so I got her a replacement for Christmas.."
2,not fun,"This product was hard to use, very slow and had no directions. Boought for a gift and is not used."
4,I can't relate to the posted prices!,"This looks like the same game that I have had for many years. It is my ""library' game, along with an original BW version of Gameboy. I think that I might have paid around $[...] for it. So, I am wondering is this some ""new"" version of the game I have? Or is this another case of pricing an item wayyyyyyyyyyyy above the true value? [...]+ is unbelieveably ridiculous... Believe me, is fun, but not THAT much fun! And I agree with some of the older reviews regarding the limitations of repeated tile selections and vowels are definitely hard to come by. Often the computer takes wayyyy too much time to play. I have to lay it down and return later."
2,Take a pass,"I have two complaints about Scrabble Express.First, if you have no play (or just want to pass your turn), the game provides no way to pass or dump your tiles. To advance the game you must make a play on each turn.Second, the game board isn't full sized (at least when compared to the board version of the game)."
4,A fun time waster,"Scrabble Express is good. It is very easy to use, and it recognized 99.5% of the words I've entered. The LCD game board display is beautiful, and the case is sturdy and artfully sculpted. My only complaint is the rack of letters given on the first turn--it seems odd to regularly get a duo of Z,X, Q, or J. When you use a turn to exchange letters, they often come back to the rack. This leads me to believe the consonants and vowels don't come randomly. I still enjoy the game, and it succeeded in being addictive at 1:30 AM."
2,"Rather limited in scope, but can be fun.","The game works well and has never malfunctioned, so physically it is very good. However, the letters in racks given are unrealistically skewed towards high-scoring letters like Q and X. Vowels are fewer than real games. The board is very small so naturally the probability of high scoring plays is small, but any good player could do well despite the size of board. I would not recommend this for adults who are advanced players as this device may be too limited in options to satisfy skilled players. However, very good for amateurs and occasional players, and has the added bonus of having a built-in dictionary so that one can be sure that all words employed are real words."
1,Outrageous Price!,"$189! This is a very truncated and limited game and there is no reason for this price other than highway robbery! I paid about $25 for a new one at least 10 years ago and was hopng the company would come up with a new and improved model. But, according to other reviewers this is exactly the same and almost 8 times the price! I hope no one falls for this! I enjoyed playing it in bed for years, though I dropped it from the bed to the heavily carpeted floor several times and eventually it died. Don't waste your money!"
1,Wait! YouThis is a waste of money!,"This device is not only too small, but visually difficult to see. There is no backlight to the dim screen and the buttons are small and awkward. If you love Scrabble then save your money for an IPAD and download that game ....Much more bang for the buck!!"
2,Disappointed Scrabble Lover,"I was very disappointed in this Scrabble game. The characters are sometimes difficult to read, the colored tiles are a little difficult to see, you're practically never given any vowels, and I first thought the game kept locking up on me until I realized that the computer-player was just very slow at times and it wasn't my turn... I guess if you just HAVE to have a Scrabble ""fix"", it would be worth having the game for those ""emergencies"", but I found that I much prefer the hand-held BOGGLE game for a word challenge. It's addictive! Whereas, I lost interest in this Scrabble game VERY quickly. Oh yeah, for some reason, the computer will just end the game too. I haven't figured this one out yet. Most of the time, I've been ahead and have always had a full hand of tiles, so it's not because the other player is running out of tiles (especially, since my computer-player seems to add only one tile to make a word, quite often.) I'd love to see an improved version made."
1,NOT useful for someone just learning Scrabble,"Make a word from this: C,Z,S,D,C,M,V (our actual letters just now - one vowel was open on the board). I bought this game because I wanted to encourage my 8-yr niece's new interest in Scrabble, but it did exactly the opposite: she stopped after 5 minutes, ""I can't make words with this"". (She may have learned a new word or two from my husband, who became quite annoyed when he tried to help her with it.) There appears to be no way to get a game which includes a reasonable number of normal letters such as ""A"", ""B"" or ""E"". Buy the ""Scrabble Word Building"" book instead."
3,Its Word List Is Valid,"I agree with the other reviewers' observations regarding the length of time it takes the computer to take its turn as well as the lack of vowels the human player is given versus the number the computer receives.But I would like to point out that the words the computer uses are accepted ""tournament word list"" Scrabble words and not nonsense words as other reviewers have asserted. I've found a couple of Scrabble words the computer will not accept, but most of them are there.Despite its shortcomings, for the money it's definitely worth it. And it's an excellent way to learn some strategies and words."
4,it gets better every day,"This game is fun, and dangerously addictive. It's great fun at the easy levels and as a 2 player game it is great. Pass it around between passengers on car trips. It is disappointing though to get so few vowels (see other reviews), but this seems to be deliberate to allow more challenging words. The built in dictionary seems to have every word in the official dictionary, including thousands of ""words you won't find anywhere else"". So far, my favorite is ""howff"". Where'd that come from? is it truely arcane English? Or is it a cruel spoof put in the OSPD not to be found anywhere else? Buy it today. But be forewarned, you will lose sleep."
2,Disappointing,"The games are very short, and seem to end when the computer wants them to. The computer is stingy in handing out vowels, so you often end up with a rack of N Z T M O Q Z, and end up in a battle of three-letter words. The computer can take five minutes or more to make a play. If the game sits for a while, it ""sleeps,"" and picks up where you left off, which is great, but if you've been playing with the sound off, the sound turns itself back on. I also wish the screen was a full-sized, easily labelled Scrabble board.Not bad for the car, but not great for when you're just kicking around."
5,A sound resource for teachers attempting to cope,"Barbara D. Bateman & Annemieke Golly, delve into their years of experience with behavioral intervention programs in Why Johnny Doesn't Behave: Twenty Tips And Measurable BIPs, a sound resource for teachers attempting to cope with irascible and worse student behavior. Extensive examples, instructional guidelines, flowcharts for determining the proper response to undesired behavior and more pack this highly recommended instructional. Also very highly recommended for classroom instructors is Barbara Bateman and Cynthia M. Herr's Writing Measurable IEP Goals And Objects (IP0021,...)"
3,left waiting,"Though the book I ordered is good the person I ordered from is the worst shipper I've run into in 10 years. I swear they put this on the slow boat to China in a time when everything the post office is handling is getting 2-3 day delivery time (I know because I mail business items every day). This book took a month to get to me and I was very disappointed in the slow laziness of the vendor. If they do this to everyone, Amazon needs to drop them!"
4,"Cute pictures, okay prayers.","My daughter likes this prayer book okay (20 months), but more for the cute pictures than the prayers. Prayers like ""I may speak in different languages of men or even angels. But if I do not have love, then I am only a noisy bell or a ringing cymbol."" Okay prayer, but a little beyond my daughters grasp and tastes."
4,quality at a low price,"I have been a DJ off and on for the last 8 years playing in several small clubs in my area (Music is the heart and soul of my life)so Quality is a must. I bought the UR15C headphones as a quick replacement to the pair of Bose that were damaged in a transport from one club to the next. I was realy amazed at the sound from such a pair like this. After replaceing the pair for ""work"" (more like a hobby) I brought my UR15c's in to use on the computer. I run mine off a Pioneer 500w reciever hooked in to my Computer this works wonders I gave up on the ""computer speaker systems"" never the sound I wanted.Here is the deal. The UR-15C Headphones though haveing a long cord(8feet)have excelent sound and power handling capibilities. There is some minor distortion when you hit the High end of the power limits. other then that there is good quality bass mids sound very good and the highs do very well. I would recomend these to anyone looking for good sound at affordable priceing."
5,A very interesting historical read.,This book is the fascinating tale of a French governess who becomes the unwilling center of one of the most famous French crimes of the nineteenth century. How her involvement in this crime is resolved and how her future in America unfolds will keep the pages turning in this factual story which is written by a relative of the main character.
2,Never finished it,"I had a hard time getting into this book. The writing style was very formal/old-fashioned, and it was overly verbose. I read about 100 pages and never really got to that ""can't put it down"" point. So I did."
2,"Boy, They'll Sell Anything, Won't They?","With poor sound quality and the absence of ""Empty Arms"" and ""I Almost Lost My Mind"" (TRUE hits), just to name two, why would anybody buy this clunker? Save your dough."
4,Shawnee Vocabulary,"This is a modern reprint of a nineteenth-century vocabulary of the Shawnee Indian language. It is a very small volume, and there is no phonetic key. An interesting book from a historical linguistics persepective or if you'd like to learn a few words of Shawnee, but don't buy it expecting to learn how to speak the language."
5,Don't be fooled; the Chopin is the real highlight!,"One may look at this CD and be immediately attached to the Rachmaninoff Third, but that isn't the real highlight of this collection. The Chopin is absolutely wonderful. Some of the mazurkas are simply wonderful, especially the mazurka in c#, Op.50 No.3. The etudes take your breath away. The only complaint is that many of the mazurkas and etudes are repeated, and although they provide a view of Horowitz's musical evolution. The polanaise is simply heroic.The Rach 3 is full of the pyrotechnics that we have come to expect. Reiner and the RCA Orchestra provide a very good accompaniment, especially in the second movement of the concerto. The Emperor is good but nothing special when compared to other pianists."
4,Horowitz wonderful Chopin and Exceptional Rach3,"The first disc starts off great with Horowitz playing Chopin. Horowitz is one of the premiere interpreters of the Romantic repertoire and his playing of the Chopin Etudes and Mazurkas is no exception. Horowitz is not particularly known for his Beethoven, but included is a wonderful of the famous Emperor Concerto with Reiner. The 2nd Cd ends with one of the best versions of Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano Concerto that you will ever hear."
3,It's All About Mini Albums,"The pictures in this book are nice. However, I dont think there was enough instructions to actually create the projects in the book."
5,Show still seems fresh,"Watching the show on a new TV through a new PS3 is a whole new experience. The story line and quirky characters were always a draw, but now the high quality video allows greater appreciation of dramatic closeups and beautiful scenery. It's like seeing HD for the first time as I see new details and beauty not evident on the original airings through a 19"" Sony. I'll be looking to score deals on later seasons, too."
3,Northern Exposure - The Complete First and Second Seasons,"Northern Exposure - The Complete First and Second SeasonsThe shows are as remembered and I like the packaging, but the DVDs have some problems. Several of them are mislabeled, either on the box, on the DVD or on the actual picture. Once I figured that out by looking at my own list of episodes, it was no problem but I found it to be a quality problem. I now own the entire series and these problems were fixed in the later episodes."
4,Northern Exposure Season 1 and 2 ROC!!!,"I very much enjoyed seasons one and two of this series. I love the show and can only say after watching the entirety of both dvds.....""that's all??"" I am surprised there are only like 8 episodes for each season. I was hoping it would be like the third season where there are like 24 episodes. Oh well. It was an awesome dvd set. I highly recommend it!!"
4,Alaska,"Being new to Alaska I could not wait to see a rendition of a first-timer in an unforgiving and ever-changing climate. I absolutely love Northern Exposure. It is equally entertaining as it is beautifully pictured of a landscape that equals none other. Alaska... not unlike any state bordering Canda...but different in culture, landscapes, people and places. Enjoy the beauty of the North through the wonders of this make-believe city as you explore the harshness and friendships that belong to the great American frontier."
3,Not the same show.,"I intend not to beat a dead horse, so I'll be brief. Without the same music, this is not the same show. Not bad, just different. I once read a critique of X-Files that likened that show to chamber music. Northern Exposure held the same attraction: atmosphere. I understand the predicament is one of licensing. Perhaps a second version, true to the original, could be released at a commensurate price. I, for one, would gladly pay the premium."
4,Fond memories,It brought back memories of a time when sitcoms were worth watching. Northern Exposure was one that we never missed.
5,Northern Exposure-Complete first and second season,"Northern Exposure is one of my favorite shows and it was so nice to get to go back to Cicely Alaska and see Joel and Chris in the morning, before they became big stars. The acting in this series is the best! Such unique characters! If you are a Northern Exposure fan or you've never seen it before, but your a fan of Rob Morrow, you need to get this series. You'll love it!!"
2,Not what I expected.......,I should have read the other reviews and saw this was not your 'usual' season but a replacement! Only 7-8 episodes for what I paid....hardly worth it.
2,Buyer Beware,"This is not the ""complete"" season 1 & 2. This set contains 4 discs with a total of 16 episodes. The discs are marked 1 & 2, when you put them in your player and read the menu they have different numbers, i.e. discs 3 & 4. This ""complete set"" is missing half of the episodes and the discs have been relabeled. I am sending mine back. Bottom line, if it seems to good to be true, it usually is. If you're a true fan of the show DO NOT waste your money."
2,"Not ""complete""series","Please Please PLEASE don't fall victim to the ""complete"" series. There are so many episodes not included in this it's scary. We bought this thinking that it was indeed the complete series--NOT SO!!!! I don't know how they can sell this as ""complete."" Amazon needs to SERIOUSLY think about what they are selling--this is definitely NOT COMPLETE!!!--for ALL SEASONS!!!!!!"
1,Partial Seasons,"I purchased the ""Complete"" 1st and 2nd season only to get two disks of each. (8 and 7 episodes) I thought complete meant just that.Very disappointed. Possibly they were the complete episodes of a certain writer. If that is the case, maybe it should say ""Only the episodes by William J. White."""
3,Disappointed,After reading the reviews of this show I thought I would love it. It was very disappointing. Joel's character is rather annoying and the acting from all the actors is rather blah. The only highlight is John Corbet!!
5,The Best,"One of the best shows produceed for T.V. Well written, sophisticated but not. Enjoyable on many levels and often inspiring. This show holds you from the moment the moose walks through town to the ending credits."
2,Northern Exposure - Season 1-2,"This is a cute show, but I was disappointed with the small number of shows that were on the DVD's. I believe season one had 8 shows and season two had 7. I felt like I paid too much money for too little."
5,northern exposure,The delivery time was super. Thank you. It is too bad this show is not still on TV. The dry humor and characters are wonderful.
1,"Lost the plot, still","If you see this with the original music, it's great! This is rubbish and when you can pay for what you want but not here, thumbs down to the current owners. I hope the Chinese buy you out so we can get this as it was created."
4,A new twist on an old game,We had so much fun with this game the truth and dare pieces were unexpectedly fun and imaginative. It was great to be able to make up your own truth or dare pieces. Would recommend this game to everyone.
5,Very Fun Game!,"I played this game with a couple of my friends and although it is designed to be a kids game I still found it very fun, funny and very entertaining during the whole of its duration.Jenga alone is very fun to play especially the longer it goes, but this adds a special little twist and makes it all the better and interesting to play.My suggestion is to get a few of your friends together and just play a few rounds, I guarentee that you won't be dissappointed by going with this one!"
3,Broken box,"Love the toy, but when we opened it it fell out of the bottom of the actual box. Because of that we had to place the parts inside of a shoe box."
4,Good item and a good price,"My folks have an older Dell Dimension 8300 and it only had 512 kb RAM. It is now very slow when trying to surf the web and even though they only do some e-mail and a bit of surfing on big sites (like NY Times) it has become intolerable. I tried to order directly through the Dell store but these chips are on backorder - would take about 2.5 months. So I tried Amazon and through a 3rd party.They arrived intact, on time and as advertised. They come in little antistatic cases. Putting them in is a bit of a hassle - but that was all due to the design of the motherboard. Two of the DIMM slots are traditional uprights. But two are on a slant which makes it awkward to seat the DIMMS. You have to use a bit of force but are always worried that it might snap or break off something.Finally they got in and now the machine is very fast - best and simplest upgrade. If possible max out the memory."
2,One piece on three did not work,One piece on three did not work: it was probably a discarded piece previously used and declared as good. Better have totally new memory banks!
3,Varga...cool,"I thought that this album was not bad in general, but it relied on three saviors. Freeze Don't Move was the coolest kick ass song that had came out at that time. Wanna mere was cool and so was Self Proclaimed Messiah. Too bad that I wore out my cassette and now I can't find the cd so I can replace it."
3,Not for oily hair,"This product is affordable and smells great, but it does not work for me. My curly hair tends to be oily at the roots and dry at the ends. After only two days of washing my hair with Low-Poo, it had become weighed down and sticky. If your scalp does not produce much oil, this product could work well for you, since it's very gentle on curls. Otherwise you need a stronger shampoo."
2,Not natural - very perfumed,"I tried out DevaCurl on the recommendation of a coworker. The ""No-Poo"" shampoo is hydrating yet cleansing. Unfortunately, it leaves behind a very STRONG perfume smell that, for me, lasted the whole day and would have gone on lasting if I hadn't given up and washed my hair with a different product. There are plenty of non-natural ingredients on the label, including the extremely offensive ""Parfum (Perfume)"" - so I should have known better. Nevertheless, all the hype DevaCurl spends on making their product sound like it's better for you than a sudsing shampoo seems sort of misplaced if they can't even take out the artificial scents.If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes etc. these are not the products for you."
4,Pretty good,"It doesn't work the curling magic of my hopes and dreams but it detangles well, defrizzes a decent amount, smells nice, and doesn't dry out my scalp like shampoo."
2,Smells awful,My hair is less frizzy with this shampoo but the smell is toxic! It makes my hair smell like it has just been dyed at the salon. I had to put my hair up and away from my face because I was getting dizzy.
3,"Eh, Okay","This shampoo is decent but I wouldn't staple it just yet. It does clean and lather well, but I'm still hunting for the best sulfate free poo for my hair. I could see it being amazing for someone else. To each it's own. Eh, okay for me.Ok, Update:I recently tried this shampoo again and loved it...stapling. Can't remember what I did differently but it cleaned well and didn't leave my scalp itchy like sulfate shampoos do."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I have been using the DevaCurl No-Poo, One Condition, and AnGEL for about two weeks and my hair is now drier, coarser, frizzier, and more disgusting than it has ever been in my ENTIRE life!!! I don't know how these products got such great reviews. Maybe the bottles I purchased are FAKE as some other reviewers have said. All I know is that my hair looks awful and these products are terrible. I would give these products 0 stars if I could. Don't waste your money on this stuff!!!"
5,Love the Deva line,"I love what the Deva Curl line is doing for my hair. I have superfine, loosely curled, over shoulder length hair that can get really dry and frizzy.Have used Deva Curl for a few weeks now, and after only one week noted that my hair is much shinier, softer, and has beautiful waves. I personally like the smell of the No-Poo....the conditioner, I am not such a fan of though. The No Poo leaves my scalp and hair clean, even though using a cleanser that doesn't lather took some getting used to! I wholeheartedly recommend this product, but make sure you only use products that are compatible- I don't think the No Poo can remove silicone based products."
3,Caution: STRONG flower smell,"My stylist recommended this product to me several years ago before moving away from the area but I only recently decided to try it out. Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I'm sure the ""no poo"" aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache. I have scent sensitivities, especially with flowery scents, so the amount of fragrance in the product would have been helpful to know in advance. I would have chosen a different product."
2,Nothing special,"My hairstylist (who trained with DevaCurl) encouraged me to try this, thinking it'd help a decade-long struggle with dandruff because maybe it was a result of a reaction to sulfates. I know it's best to avoid sulfates, but because they're missing, this doesn't lather, and I feel like it's hard to tell when I've gotten it thoroughly disbursed through my very curly hair. I've used Trader Joe's sulfate-free shampoo, yet I think it still lathered a bit so it was easier to get through the hair. Regardless, the No-Poo didn't help my dandruff at all, and I don't think it's made much of a difference in my hair in general. Disappointing for how expensive it is."
5,Great for my Hair,"I have a natural wave to my hair and I love this product. My sister gave me a bottle of DevaCurl No-Poo last year for Christmas and I simply love it. It cleans my hair well, is good for the environment, has no sulfites, and I don't have to use a conditioner. What a product!"
2,"Smells hideous, but works","This shampoo (or no-poo) does work. It makes my hair frizz-free, and enhances the natural wave that I have. However, the smell is AWFUL! It actually reminds me of the smell of perm solution -- it's very strong and chemical-like (the conditioner smells only slightly better -- like the soap in the car wash). For me, the scent of a product is equally important as whether or not it can get the job done. If you can get past the smell, it is a good product. But, I will be shopping for another sulfate-free shampoo product."
3,"Nice case, carrying strap could be longer",Case fit nicely with my new Sunpack tripod. Could have more give on the carrying strap. Too tight to sling it over my shoulder.
1,unfortunate title perpetuating old fashioned words,"once again it's really unfortunate that the author, who wrote a nice little book, used such old fashioned terminology by putting the ""Down syndrome"" in front of her daughter.A person is a person FIRST and having Down syndrome is secondary to that, and should always come after the PERSON.So, please don't say Down syndrome person, Down syndrome baby or daughter or whatever.Our children are children FIRST. They just also happen to have DS...but it doesn't define them."
4,"Uncommon, indeed","Perhaps the most uncommon thing about Mr. Chestnut, the first African-American lawyer in Selma, is that he doesn't see himself as that extraordinary.This book, which was as much about the man as it was about the civil rights movement, was a quick read that I often wished would last a lot longer.I really enjoyed both the front-line perspective on a movement I only read about in history books, and as a law student, the legal angle was also fascinating."
4,Seminole fans will appreciate the stories,"This thin book gathers a good number of stories about Florida State head football coach Bobby Bowden, and the team itself.While not a serious study of the rise of college football in America, or at least Tallahassee, it does focus on the ways in which Bowden lives his life, and the resulting success of the FSU football team in the last 15 years. It focuses strongly on the period after 1990, when the team successfully finished it seasons among college's best year after year.With stories that last only a few paragraphs or so in most cases, this will entertain a Seminole fan for a short while, but it won't satisfy a desire for an in-depth look into the football program that Bowden has built over his successful, long tenure at FSU."
3,Carole Berkoff,"The general format of this software using flashcards to facilitate learning is very helpful to me. I like being able to listen to the words as many times as I need to and to be able to slow them down. I do find that some of the lists are too small in the number of words offered. If you want to add a word you can but it is not easy to add sound. Some of the ""native speakers"" pronounciation such as buongiorno sounds as if she is not too happy & I prefer not to emulate. When I did find a way to record, then when I went to record my voice, the feedback system failed. I find this software in general more helpful than just listening to language CDs. I do think that the software developers could do a lot more with this system."
3,Indie Drama That Will Test & Reward Your Patience,"A story of friendship that will try & reward your patience. The story is set in a small Arkansas town and is based on a true story. The main characters (Luke Grimes, Dan McCabe & Misti Traya) are older teens going through coming-of-age experiences that most viewers will find familiar and will ring true for that stage of life. These 3 talented, young actors give solid performances that are supported by such accomplished pro's as Brian Dennehy, Mare Winningham, James McDaniel & Mary Kay Place). The story-line seemed a bit choppy for my taste, but the scenery, mood of the film, & main plot line (meaningful friendship) outweighed that minor flaw. I think it bears mentioning that the pace of the film is slooow but perseverance will be rewarded."
5,The story that appeals to everyone.,"This is a story that will reach everyone's heart & memory. It's a story of friendship, love & family. Throw in the drive to be the best in baseball & story of first love. Incredible scenery."
1,fooled again,very misleading ad they show 12 books in the picture even list I - XII sure enough i open up the package and it's one book. this is why you shouldn't buy things on the internet
1,Drivel,"Why is it that creationists with no background in paleontology are always writing books about paleontology? Starkey's book makes me think of a car mechanic ranting about all the things wrong with heart surgery. Over and over again Starkey makes claims and blatant mistakes of fact that are easy to demonstrate so the further you plow into the book the more ridiculous it all seems. The saddest part is that anyone with even a cursory understanding of paleontology can tear his book apart with very little effort. The problem isn't whether you believe in evolution or not -- Starkey just gets his facts wrong over and over again. Sadly, if he can't get his facts right, he isn't going to convince anyone, even a well-read creationist. Skip this turkey -- it's just drivel."
5,Excerpts from e-mails received by the author.,"""I recently purchased this book and I deem this book to be the best novel I ever read. I recommend it to be read by all sailors."" Thomas SM1 (Ret), TX.""Dear Pat; Lee read the book in 2 days, and said it was the best book he had ever read on the subject."" Jan. FL.""Boatswain's Mate! Read it, great book!"" Harry ABM, OR.""Pat, we finally got the book. Good news is: Curtis couldn't put it down...I lost a husband for awhile."" Pat, VA.""I have read the book and it is outstanding. As a retired E-9 I would like to say that it held my interest throughout."" Mike OSCM (Ret), LA.""Pat, finished your book. I could really relate to WWII and Korea. Thanks, really enjoyed it."" Jon, IL."
5,Sea Stories & Fairy Tales,"In the Book ""Boatswain's Mate"" by Pat Johnston, Jake Rickmeyer didn't spend a lot of time hanging around the fo'c'sle, swapping sea stories about their ground takle with the other Bo's'ns... He was out and about making things happen in three wars. I received a recommendation for the book through the USS STODDARD (DD-566) Reunion Association, a WW II Destroyer that supported the type of missions Jake participated in, especially in the Vietnam era. Read the book and loved it! ... I'll leave you hanging to see the outcome of this very warm, homey book. Excellent writing, great style. I look forward to future productions from Pat Johnston."
1,Give it a miss,"Not very well put together, repetitive story about an enlisted man in the Navy, spanning WWII, Korea, and Viet Nam. Initially I picked it up thinking it was a non-fiction, first person account of life in the US Navy. After reading a few chapters, I couldn't put it down, as I couldn't believe a story this thin actually got published, so I needed to see where this story would actually go (not very far, it turns out) . One of the more interesting aspects of this book are the many misspellings and typos. It appears that no editor ever looked at this book, only a computer spell-checker. If you must buy it, don't spend more than a dollar or two."
1,Madness,"Torrey is psychiatry's Torquemada. There is no limit to the ""scientific"" tortures that he supports applying to unwilling to heretics labeled ""schizophrenic."" There are a couple of dicey problems. The people so labeled rarely believe themselves to be sick, and there is no biological test that can demonstrate that they are so. The ""schizophrenics"" act in ways that bother other people, and professionals like Torrey become influential and wealthy by diagnosing and ""treating"" them (against their will). The pseudoscience that Torrey promotes in this book has been thoroughly debunked by Thomas Szasz and others. (It was Szasz who wryly noted, ""If you talk to God, you are praying, If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia."") This book should actually be titled, ""How to be rid of odd and unpopular people."""
4,Excellent Introduction to Schizophrenia,"This is an important book. It explains what is known about Schizophrenia broadly and includes suggestions for further reading. I can't imagine a better guide for families and consumers, although for professionals, the information is fairly basic. I enjoyed looking through this book because Dr. Torrey writes personably , making it an invaluable resource for those who are surviving Schizophrenia."
4,Great Information,"This book has provided me with a lot of information regarding Schizophrenia. It helped answer questions that I wanted to know. I wanted a book that would provide knowledge on the illness, since the only knowledge I had was through hear say. This book has satisfied that need."
2,Pricey Plastic,overpriced and very cheap looking. It's plastic and its not oil rubbed bronze.Dont waste your money!
4,Interesting,"I read this book in a semester in a biochem special topics class. The explanations are pretty good, although some are a little confusing and need to be reworded. It was very nice having a book on one subject. Other texts might need to be referenced, especially for Chapter 2 - some of the ways to get transcription factors - cDNA, etc. The pictures, although simple, are very helpful in understanding the concepts. Beware of the last chapter though. A bunch of transcription factors are thrown at you at once. That was a lot to digest in a short amount of time."
5,Eye-opening and compelling,"Doug Litowitz's book on young lawyers is a must read for lawyers, law professors, law students, and potential law students. Although Litowitz occasionally overstates a point--for example, I disagree that all, or most, law professors were unsuccessful lawyers and that all, or most, law professors employ the Socratic method to demoralize students--authors are permitted poetic license if the general message they are trying to convey is important and true. Litowitz's message is both of these things: the systems through which we train and employ young lawyers is broken and needs to be fixed. Litowitz's book is also extremely well-written, and holds the reader's attention from start to finish. I recommend it unreservedly and I commend Litowitz for his brave and profound book."
2,weak nylons,"Bought these strings, played them for a while...not my style, I had hoped for much better clarityin the higher tones but these nylons are worthless to me....don't really feel the strings ring welltogether...will try something else next time."
1,Sid Caesar Collection - The Magic of Live TV,Can't review because of non-delivery. It is now Mar. 8 and I it ordered on Jan. 30.Looked forward to getting it but it is not to be.
2,Dissapointing,"I found this book quite dissapointing. Although I did learn a great deal about Valley Forge, the author seemed more concerned with proving his point than with attempting a balanced and accurate history. His arguments were just too forced and narrow."
3,You get what you pay for!,"I was not impressed with this product. It was smaller than I thought, and the base was dented. It was hard to seperate the actual lights because they come smashed together. I guess you get what you pay for and I don't think this product was worth what I paid."
5,"Cute, different, great price!","A very different look, offering a variety of options, cute charms--and a bargain. I bought 2 sets for gifts and one for me!"
5,Armchair Travel from the Kitchen,"I have this book and have used it for several dinner parties. People love the meals and love looking through the cookbook. The fantastic photographs not only capture the the dishes perfectly, but also give an excellent glimpse of Morocco, the place. Julie Le Clerc is so good at translating the local foods into recipes that anyone can make. I envision many more wonderful meals from this cookbook."
4,great for kids,I bought this book for my daughter (age 8)- she loves it and works on it at different times. The book helps to stimulate the mind with different games along with some fun.
5,Prepare yourself for an awesome adventure!,"Prior to cruising to the canal I chose to read this account of the building the amazing structure...I highly recommend preparing any visitor to this area to read this, or any other source relating the facts surrounding this project"
5,Nice flops!!,"I bought these to kick around the beach and mow grass, but now I wear them everywhere. They maintain grip when wet and are comfortable enough to wear all day. I have always been a rainbow fan and this is another great product. I bought the black. No smell issues or color rubbing off. Arch support is adequate and I have a med/hi arch. I wear size 13 and these are sized right on. Break in period was about 3 hours of wear with no discomfort. They clean up easy too. Recommended."
1,High price good fit NO Warranty!,"No slam on this seller. Don't pay extra money for this product because the manufacturer will not honor the ""lifetime"" warranty offered as a selling point on all other Rainbow Sandals. Bought the Rainbow Sandals for my husband at a pricey beach store and seriously overpaid, but they fit well and came with a ""lifetime"" warranty. Don't believe it and don't bother to pay shipping to have defective shoes sent to the manufacturer. The shoes we returned were two years old and were clearly delaminating and all we got was a gee sorry letter stating if we wanted the defective shoes back we would have to pay for return postage..The delamination was never mentioned. This product is NOT worth the xtra $$. The warranty is bogus!"
5,Rainbow flip flops,"Do you know how difficult it is to find Men's 14 shoes? My son wears size 14 and has since he was 13. When he entered high school all the other boys were wearing flip flops and I couldn't find any that were size 14. Finally at a local retailer, I found one pair of Rainbows that were size 14. Every year I would look for flip flops that were size 14. I would bring other brands home and my son would ask ""Didn't they have Rainbows?"". I was so excited when I found them on Amazon this year. I don't know why I didn't think to look before now. These aren't your ordinary flip flops."
1,Falling apart,"I bought these flipflops for my son for Christmas. They are falling apart. Returns are supposed to be easy. I went online to exchange them and could not do so. I have to send them back, wait until they are rec'd (approx 2-3) to get a refund. My son is in college and walks from his apartment to the college every day. He can't go without shoes. VERY frustrating. The downfall of shopping on Amazon I guess and with this store."
2,Look nice but made for tiny feet,These sandals look nice and appear to be good quality. Sadly they strap on top is sooo tight that I can barely fit my foot into the sandal. Only purchase if you have thin feet.
5,Awesome,"These flip flops are great. They look good, feel great and hold up well. I finally bought something online that is as good as it looks."
5,Solid purchase- great product,"Sandals are comfortable and durable. You can literally feel the quality when you put them on. They are a little tight for the first couple days until you break them in, and after that they are amazing. I would buy them again in a heartbeat. You won't regret this purchase!"
5,Rugged yet comfortable,I thought I would need a larger size when I bought these in my shoe size because they felt really tight on my feet but after a week or so of breaking them in I must say they feel just fine. They look very firm so they'll probably last quite some time but at the same time they are very comfortable. The top half of the sandal is made out of some sort of soft rubber providing great cushioning and the bottom half is made out of solid rubber.
5,Best Sandals I've owned,"Bought my pair at the Orange County Fair last weekend. They truly are the best feeling sandals I've owned and good cushion along with having great support. These pair of sandsls I feel I can wear anywhere, because of the support it provides along with the great feel. I would definitely buy another pair."
3,Product review,"The phone has a real clean look and works fairly well, BUT the battery life is short and the range is less than our older Panasonic model. SO, I still use both sets as we have a large area to cover. One set for in the house and the older set for outside."
1,Buyer beware!,"This phone was listed as NEW on Amazon through DAKAMART and it is NOT NEW. It states on the product box that it may contain refurbished parts. Mine obviously did as the base was scratched. DAKMART's receipt blatantly says new on it as well. DAKMART also subscribes you to ""Sync"" magazine without your permission. (send a self-addressed stamped enveloped to unsubscribe and get $4.99 back on a ""Free"" subscription!?!)1 month later the phone no longer gets a dialtone after making calls.This is blantant misrepresentation and Amazon would do well to reconsider their relationship with DAKMART."
1,No dial tone,"I've had this phone over a year, and every once and a while I would pick it up and no dial tone. I would unplug it, plug it back in and most of the time it worked. Now it doesn't work it all - no dialtone whatsoever and no help from Uniden. I do not recommend this phone."
2,Range is poor,"Surprised to see all of the positive reviews. It only takes about 50' before my signal breaks up. Once I walk downstairs, it will cut out completely. My prior set was a Uniden 2.4ghz, and it definitely had better range. Nice features, but due to the lack of range I would not buy this product again."
1,Batteries Die After One Year,"I've had these phones for a year now and the batteries are already dying. After 30-45 minutes off of the base both phones begin beeping and last about 5 more minutes. Pretty ridiculous given the cost and that my old panasonic cordless still lasts about 10 hours off of the base.Of note, when these were new they did have great range..."
1,Junk!!! Absolutely No Range,"I bought this phone for my father and the two line version for my own house because we have wireless networks and the existing 2.8 wasn't cutting it. This phone is a piece of junk. I wish I had my old 2.8G back.They tell you it has excellent range but that is just not true. It cuts out on us from just one room away from our base station and it is virtually impossible to use from upstairs. You would be better off to stick with your existing phone or buy a 2.4G phone because this one is completely useless. I ordered online and am out postage both directions and a 15% restocking fee, but this phone is completely useless.I read the only review that was posted when I purchased, but don't believe it. It has to be a mfr. plant."
1,Horrible Range,"My parents bought this phone for the range and when I call them if they are outside it breaks up. Can't hear them speak and it's very annoying. Also picks up all background noise and amplifies it. May work well for the person that owns the phone, but it's awful for the person calling you!"
2,Bad physical handset design,When you tuck this phone in between your shoulder and head (to talk without hands) the big button that ends your call presses against your face and hangs up the phone!This is just bad design. It doesn't matter if the reception is good or bad (mine is just OK) if the phone hangs up while you're talking.
1,"Nice phone,.... if you live in a cardboard box!!!","I have been looking to get a replacement phone for my 900 mz Uniden cordless along with my 10-year old answering machine and have given serious consideration to this phone.However, I will pass. The problem is with design. Why, in heaven almighty, did the people at Uniden think that a smaller telephone is a better telephone? The buttons are way too small on the base!!! If I need to put my face constantly within 12 inches of the phone in order to see what the buttons are, then that phone is staying in the store. And my eyesight is pretty good.The phone can have all the bells and whistles it wants, but it needs to meet minimum ergonomic standards for convenience purposes. Uniden failed here.There are many people who seem to love this telephone; however, I bet there are many more people who passed this phone over for the same reason I mentioned above. Hopefully, Uniden will correct this flaw in the next release of this line."
1,This System Just Doesn't Work,"I live in a suburban area where we have had no trouble with previous 900 GHz and 2.4 gig phones. As Uniden has an excellent reputation, I tried this 5.8 GHz system.After 3 months I now have to buy a new system. The phones are very erratic with reception fading in-and-out whether we walk with the phones or sit still in some rooms of our house. There is often distinct background noise, and callers tell us we sometimes sound as though we are ""underwater.""One of the 3 extra handsets completely failed within 1 month. It cannot connect with the base unit, even when fewer than 6 inches away from it.This is just not a good system. I have read other reviews from people who love it. Perhaps these phones work well in some areas; they are definitely substandard in our area.These phone are a big risk, and that's just not worth the money unless you have money to burn."
4,Cordless phones,"The phones and answering device look good and work well. We had a little trouble setting the system up as the directions included were not pertinent to the model we bought. But, once hooked up, it works fine. I really like the personal ring tones available."
4,awesome,"I agree with most other 4-5 stars. I have owned nothing but junk in the past, as I really do not use land lines often. But now that we have this phone, I find myself using it often for local calls, and even answering calls coming in for my fiance (yes, our previous phones were that bad :). Crystal clear communication (both internal and speakerphone), easy to program/ figure out options, and very easy on the ears...For the money, this phone is exactly what we needed.Cheers,Zack"
2,Underwhelmed and Underwater,"I was so excited to buy this very attractive phone from the comapny that I regard as the industry leader. They have such a great reputation and this phone is beautiful design.It has everything I was looking for.BUT there is a huge problem, which is that all of the callers and people I am talking to say that I sound like I am underwater. Or in a tunnel. Every single person I talk to has a really hard time hearing me clearly. This is so sad and annoying. It's unacceptable from a company like Uniden. Now I have to shop around again, and that is a drag."
3,Poor Sound Quality - Took it back,"Pros:This phone has it all. The menu system was really easy. The room monitoring feature was cool. I liked the fact that all of the buttons glowed (Think about it, if you are in the dark, what good does it do you if you only see the number pad? You may need to transfer a call, adjust volume, etc.).Cons:As easy as the phone was, we took it back because I was not pleased with the sound quality. Using the phone people that called me sounded great. However, people thought that I sounded fuzzy. The sound quality is okay, but was not as good as my current 900 and 2.1. Due to that fact we purchased a competing 5.8 phone and the sound quality was as clear as a bell."
4,Not all the same,It appears that one of the three handsets operate different from the other two. It basically operates the same so is livable but annoying. Something to watch for.
2,Good phone but terrible answering machine,"The phone works like any normal cordless phone. Battery life seems good, sound quality good, has held up just fine through a few falls. No problems with the phone itself. But the answering machine is sketchy. The biggest complaint is that it records a message for every call. Even people that hang up as soon as the message starts. So for every missed call, you have a blank message. Not just one for the people who actually leave messages. And after each person hangs up (whether during the message or after they leave a message) there is a dial tone sound for a few seconds on each message. This is SOOO annoying. Annoying enough that I'm getting rid of it and getting a Panasonic."
5,Super Phone System,"This about our fifth set of cordless phone systems we have purchased in the past 5 years. This one is, by far, the best one we have found. The sound is sharp and clear, they are relatively simple to set up and use, and are loaded with extra features which really make them the perfect phone. The answering system sound is crisp and clear and very simple to use and set up. The handsets are lightweight and just the right size - small and handy to use, with an extra large read-out screen that is backlit in orange with black lettering which makes it extremely simple to read.If you are looking for a good cordless answering system with cordless handsets this is the one! There are extra handsets available and the system will support up to 10 extra handsets!A super product at a a super price. Buy it!"
1,Don't do it,"Mine is faulty. Like another reveiewer's unit, mine drops the dial tone and resets itself occasionally. It's flawed. Design and feel are also not that great: tiny buttons and less than intuitive controls. Orange display is not a plus. I recommend that others look elsewhere: the Uniden model is not as nice as the six-year-old Panasonic I was trying to replace."
2,"Some good features, some bad","I've owned this phone for about a year, and I find I'm having more issues with it.1 - the phone's reception is really, really poor -- especially for a 5.8 gHz phone. I'm usually talking right next to the base station, and in half the calls it either echoes or breaks up to the point I can't hear them clearly (just like a cell phone) and have to call the person back.2 - it doesn't have a ""channel"" button!! So if it does break up, you have no alternative than to try calling again, or go running in your house until you find just the right spot -- like some other reviews here mentioned. I couldn't agree with them more. Even my cheapest 2.4 Ghz phones had 'channel' buttons.All in all, I'm sure you can find a better phone for the money."
5,Addition to other reviews,I agree with the positive reviews. This is a great phone. I would add that you can alter CID to add the 1 before you save to the phonebook. Just have the CID on the screen and then press the * (tone) button on the handset. Then save. Enjoy the phone it works well and the base footprint is small. Great improvement over the very expensive Panasonic I had. It will be on ebay soon!
1,These units suck,"I don't know who writes these reviews stating no problems, but I've had nothing but problems with them. The handsets keep going dead, that's right dead, nothing works. I've been told to reset them by holding the ""*"" and ""#"" keys while pluging in the battery and wait for the beep, this actually worked once, never again. I've got a total of 4 handsets and 3 of them are currently dead. Obviously it wasn't a fluke that one or even two went bad, but now 3 out of 4 are worthless and I can't reset any of them. Replacing these via Uniden is not worth the effor it would take to have this done, if you've read their replacement/repair rules."
5,Uniden TRU8885-2 5.8 GHz Cordless Phone,"I've gone through many cordless phones and the change to this one was due to interference on my wireless network from a 2.4GHz phone. The interface is the most user friendly of all the phones I've had. Especially simple is accessing call waiting and creating a conference call. The bright orange display is easy to read and it's a cinch to program in numbers. The answering machine, self-contained in each handset and on the base station, is easy to program and has a very clear sound. Highly recommended."
3,TLent,"Pros:Handset receiving sound is excellent for most calls, and I have VOIP Vonage.Features are rich and easy to use.Cons:Low outbound volume, particularly from plantronics or ATT headsets and only fair from handset. On conference calls people cannot hear me.Speakerphone duplex works very well but a bit tinny."
3,Short Range and Cheaper Quality than TRU 58xx Series,"I had high hopes for the new TRU88xx series after having owned the 58xx series which I really liked (only problem was that it could not expand past one remote handset). So I bought their new 5.8Ghz phone system and tried it out. In summary, I like the new features, but the phone quality (especially the sound) and the range are not as good as the older one. If you have a small house this will work fine, then what's the point of having a multi-line system in the first place?"
1,Power out takes out phone.,"I've had the Uniden phone for 2 months now. It worked fine until today - nothing special but a solid phone. After today's power outage, I now have to purchase new phones. The Uniden base unit no longer boots. We did have a short period of low voltage during the power out which I'm guessing took out the phone. It is the only thing in the house though that didn't survive. I'll not be buying another Uniden phone after this experience. I just expect better quality out of a ""quality"" device. If you have one or are buying one be sure you place it on a surge protector with low voltage protection."
2,Worked great for a couple of weeks,"I did a lot of research (consumer reports, amazon, etc) and decided to get this phone. It has worked excellent for a couple of weeks. Now all of the sudden, the static, or interference, has been unbearable. Like the other reviewer said, you can't change channels or anything. The user manual says ""1)Keep the handset away from microwave ovens, computers, remote control toys, wireless microphones, alamrm systems, intercoms, room monitors, fluorescent lights, and electrical appliances. 2) Move to another location or turn off the source of interference."" Are they kidding? Power down everything, then use the phone. I am going to return and buy another brand."
2,Bad sound quality,"We bought this phone to replace a bad GE cordless. After doing a lot of research on expandable cordless phones and their features and reading reviews, we bought this one. All the features are great, but the sound quality is horrible. It is not consistent. The handset will sound great with one call, but the next will sound terrible. We can hear fine but the person on the other end says that we sound muffled and/or like we're in a tunnel. It's the same way when you use speakerphone or a headset. I thought for the money we paid we would have gotten a great phone, which it is if you don't care if the person you're speaking to can't hear you. This phone is being sent back today and my journey to find a good phone continues..."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I've never been a fan of Uniden products. I always thought they were low quality and didn't bother with them since using a few of the products several years ago.When I was shopping for an expandable phone system to hook up to my Vonage router, I tried other phones by Motorola and Panasonic. They didn't work very well - poor reception, weak speakerphone, etc.Then I saw this Uniden, which had all the features I was looking for - base station, handset speakerphone, do not disturb - and it looked decent.I've had this phone for over 6 months and love it! It's performed better than the others I tried and has held up really well.I just noticed this weekend that a picky friend of mine is using the same phone."
3,"Great, when it's working.","The Uniden 8885-2 (two handset configuration) is one in a series of phone sets we've had over the years. This one is loaded with features and has a great range from the base compared to others we've had. Fact is, we were completely satisfied until we had owned it about a year and a half. Since that time first one then the other of the handsets has intermittently failed to respond to any of the buttons on the handset. It will be a paperweight like that for a time, maybe a day, then next time you try it it's working again. Naturally, that's not OK if you find out it won't work when it's ringing. We've replaced it now with a Panasonic.Before we gave up I contacted tech support 3 times trying to see if there was a fix. There wasn't. And they thought it about right that the phone lasted less than 2 years. Not much pride in those folks."
1,Phones don't work if you have wood walls!!!!,"These phones work great in our son's home that is all drywall, but we are very disappointed that they only work in our home if you are in the SAME ROOM as the base station! We have double wall construction, with soudboard insulation in some walls, and UNIDEN Customer Service just informed me that the 5.8 gig frequency does not go thru wooden walls! They said a 900 meg phone would work the best for us. They said, ""you know, we test all of our phones in an open field with no obstructions!"" So it is VERY MISLEADING that UNIDEN advertises these phones as ""the most powerful cordless phone ever built!"" Live and learn, people!"
5,"I haven't heard the album, I can answer the questions posed.","Rosco Martinez is one of the best guitarist/singers out there today, I know this because I sat in with him and his new band 5 or 6 times recently. He is playing down around South Florida a lot, and he coordinates the Thursday Night Jam Sessions at Ray's Downtown Blues in West Palm Beach. He also appears frequently at the Blue Note Cafe in Jupiter, Florida and in and around Ft. Lauderdale. I understand that Rosco is in the recording studio recording both original and cover material for a new album, but I don't know much else beside that. I highly suggest you guys go and see him because he is a one of a kind musician.From,Casey Hopkins"
5,Rosco Martinez,Early album of a real star and a great guy! Can't wait for new material that he is working on.
5,Not quite the same...,"I saw this and was wondering if it was the same show that I watched back in the 80's... I didn't think so because it looked a bit ""too old"" and then I saw another reviewer state that they *had* done a remake of it from the late 70's to mid 80's. That is the version that I saw, which made it a bit more modern I'm sure, but I am guessing that this old version has the same charm as the newer remake of it (I have not seen any episodes of this old version), so I can't really say too much about it.I did love the remake as I was growing up in Canada, I still remember the theme song and actually found a clip of it on some random website last year (using Stumble Upon) which made me go ""awww"" and wish that I could see just one episode again.How does that theme go again? ""Maybe tomorrow, I'll go and settle down. Maybe tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on..."" Something like that, hee."
5,One of the best TV series ever on DVD!!,"It's great to have The Littlest Hobo on DVD. I really enjoyed the TV series back in the early 60's the first time I saw it. I can hardly wait for the rest of the episodes from this excellent TV series to be released on DVD. VCI did an excellent job in restoring this classic TV series, the color episodes are great considering their age."
2,Not for me....,Although this product came recommended by my Dr. it was not for me. Caused all of the joints in my hands and feet to ache and eventually itch. Very disappointed!
2,This mark is cheap but not very good,"'ve actually bought several products from this brand and I have been very effective, this I have been taking and have not seen conclusive results, I had to return to previous treatment with glucosamine to see improvement ..."
2,No noticable benefit,"Doesn't seem to work for me. I've not seen any change in my arthritic hands, knees, ankles etc. Could be because I don't believe strongly enough. 8-)"
5,not just for people!,"I have a 5 year old Border collie who was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia. He tried expensive Rx pain meds and a very expensive injectable medication all with little results. I got Boswellia on the advice of another dog owner with a dysplastic dog. Within 2 weeks, Luca was back to running and playing normally, no more crying, limping, morning joint stiffness, or trouble getting in the car. I have been able to stop all pain meds and he is just on glucosamine and the Boswellia twice daily. I highly recommend this to other owners of dogs with joint problems!"
2,I cannot tell that it helps me.,"I have previously used Boswellia Extract 500mg from Springtime, Inc. Their bottles are 3 for $48 or $16 each. I guess I was trying to save money, but the few dollars I saved was not worth it. My joint pain is much worse than when I was taking the Springtime Boswellia."
3,tinkerbell,"I dont know if you are supposed to get both sets in the order but we only got one. Our daughter likes them anyway, they are great for a decoration."
5,Fantastic book for all designers using colour!,"This is a fantastic resource for anyone designing in colour. I do mostly online design and use this book every day. It is a specialised colour combination scale based on research done by the author.Pick a base colour and see its combinations, what they mean to most people and where they are typically used. Awesome stuff!"
4,A tiny gem of a book.,"This book and its companion, ""Color Image Scale,"" are excellent sources of palette ideas for web work. (If you buy one, buy both.) As an amateur designer, I found their treatment of the emotional impact of color groupings to be enlightening and thought inspiring. On the down side, they don't provide CMYK or RGB values--a minor inconvenience."
5,Great Resource!,"I was looking for a book on color that would give some color combinations that could be applied to my quilting and needlework. This book did not disappoint. It is broken down into several categories, giving color options and inspiration. There is some discussion on color and theory but it is not a text book and it does not over-burden you with facts you probably did not really want to know about color...you just wanted to harmonize and coordinate. I have picked this book up numerous times now and flip through the pages when I am stuck on what color I want to work with on a project and I have yet to not be inspired. I also purchased a ""Gardner's Color Wheel"" here on Amazon and working with the two makes coordinating thread color and fabric so much easier.If you want color inspiration without all the history and theory of color, this is the book for you!"
5,Just what I was looking for!,"We have a very small master bathroom with no wall space for hanging towels. I was using a wooden clothes drying rack which took up too much room in a hidden area of our bedroom, and I hated it. I found the Leifheit Telegant 100 Mounted clothes dryer on Amazon and ordered it. It's the larger of the two models (almost 40"" wide). I recommend this for either an ""always open"" dryer or for occasional use. It's easy to open and close and has a slim profile when closed. It's perfect for a laundry room, bathroom or, in my case, in that hidden area of the bedroom. It's made of plastic, including the thin bars on which clothes can be draped. I'm careful when using it so I don't recommend it for less than careful husbands/children. Made in Germany and very clever!"
5,Telegant 100 Review,"I bought this product because my MIL has one and I used it at her house. It was fairly easy to install after we replaced the wimpy European-style anchors with our own. The clip-on things that came with it don't really work, but I bought it mainly to use for all my drip-dry items and it works great for them and then it folds up nicely when I've finished using it."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I recently remodeled my kitchen and Laundry room area. Since we enter the house from the garage through the laundry room I wanted it to look neat and organized. This replaced a rack I had on the wall before the remodel. That one was accordian style and did not stay in the closed position. This one does not look like a drying rack unless it is opened. It is perfect for drying items that need to be hung, like lingerie and tops. I use the hooks on the towel bar often for small items. I actually use the sock hooks provided but installed them on the wire shelf I have over my machines so I don't have to open the rack at all to use them. You cannot close the rack with these installed on it."
5,Love this drying rack!,"We first saw this at a local kitchen remodeling store and found it available on Amazon. Folds to less than 3 inches when closed and expands large enough to hold a couple of pairs of exercise shorts, as well as clips to hold pot holders to dry and socks. I don't know if I would hang anything too heavy, but we love how quick it folds out of the way and appears to hide on the wall. Would highly recommend!"
5,Great for small space,Product was just what I was looking for to hang my fine washables and line dry only items. It also came with two plastic clipon attachments that are great for hanging hose and underwear that I don't see pictured. It is well worth the money.
3,space saver but flimsy,"This is a great space saver. Saves me having to maneuver around a drying rack on the floor. However, the cross bars are extremely flimsy- to where even hanging a wet towel on them makes them bow to where I'd be afraid they'd break, so I've not pushed it to that limit. Also, the brackets that hold the rods in place are plastic, and I'm afraid that they might snap as well. There are some clips along the back heavy metal rod, on which you could attach a hanger and hang things more safely, but they are very close to the wall, so they don't allow for quick drying. I have hung lighter weight wet items such as jeans w/o any damage. So overall, I'm still happy I got the product."
4,It is what it says it is...,"It is exactly what it says it is.I installed on a concrete wall - so no searching for studs.It is pretty sturdy, and I am satisfied - it is what it said it was.I think if you expect to be able to dry 10 pairs of heavy jeans, this product will be a bit disappointing. If you plan to hang regular clothing, of mixed types and weights, it will work great."
4,A bit smaller than I wanted,"It's a great space saver, but it doesn't hold an awful lot - not nearly as much as a free-standing rack."
4,Life IS good.,"This thing was a moderate breeze to mount, and it's wonderful to use. The bars are very strong; we've had wet sheets, towels, sweaters, trousers, plus all the regular ol' laundry draping and hanging from this beast and it ain't no thang. Very, very durable. The little hooks and tethers it comes with are extremely convenient and I wish I could purchase more of them by themselves. Only problem so far is that one side has a slight manufacturing molding defect that doesn't allow us to lock the pull in place, but this doesn't really affect use. Overall an excellent product."
4,helpful to the family,It was a little challenging to install as you had to have it fully extended and the sides extend unevenly so you have to be careful when closing it
1,Stay away from Viore,It feels pretty lowsy when you need a universal remote and find that your TV is the only one that doesn't allow you to code into a universal remote. On some universals Viore is listed but the codes don't work. I called the company and they said they contract their own people and I would have to pay for one through their company but I would need the model number (which is not listed on my TV). Better not loose your remote or have your dog chew on it...because you will not be able to run to the store and pick up a $6 remote. Pretty Un Customer friendly I would say. Pretty sleezy too.
4,2 years old and still truckin!,"I bought this TV as a Black Friday item Nov 26, 2006 for $[...]. No warranty was available and I was real sceptical in purchasing since it was the first time I ever took the plung into HDTV. I own both the 360 with HD-DVD, and PS3 and this system ROCKS with both units. The 360 is used for games and HD-DVD, but the PS3 I use for the Blu-Ray and here is a cool thing, I run 10MP photo's of family events when guests come over as a slideshow. I use a can of air on the TV every 3 months and clean it regularly. I put the timer on whenever we watch it late at night to avoid burn in. I love every bit of it no problems, with care this system two years later shows no sign of disappointing me."
5,Been a great TV,I thought I would write and after reading all the poor reviews I will say that this plasma TV was our first H.D. TV that our son bought us for Christmas in 2006. It's 2012 and it still is going strong it's had many hours of work.. my hubby is a TVaholic.. The only problem we had as we developed a couple of lines in the Plasma for a while which really did not bother our viewing but we have noted they have disappeared now.. the only other problem is we have Dish TV and we can't get the remote to turn the TV off and on or volume but everything else works on the remote.. it's not a big deal tho but it would be nice. I did just try to contact them for a code and well since it's only been ten minutes I will give them time to reply with a code if they have one or not that will work. Our son loves to watch this TV and he's paid more money for H D tvs than we have he has about four big one's and he says we get the best picture on the Viore.. Well that's my two cents..
1,VIORE TV'S ARE GARBAGE,"THEY BREAK AFTER 2-3 WEEKS, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE AND THEY WONT STAND BY THEIR WARRANTY.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,"VIORE PLASMA 42"" JUNK..FROM WALMART...SPART PARTS NOW!!!","THIS PIECE OF JUNK ONLY LASTED 2 YEARS.I PAID 1000 FOR IT.THATS 500 A YEAR TO WATCH THIS PLASMA TV.HAD IT LOOKED AT AND THE TV REPAIR GUY SAID THE POWER SUPPLY WAS SHORTED AND IT WOULD COST $390.00 TO FIX IT. HE ALSO SAID LG MAKES THE PARTS FOR VIORE TV'S, AND THEY WERE AVAILABLE.I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM WALLMART ....DARNIT....VIORE IS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VIORE JUNK!!!!@@##@@!@"
1,Never buy a Viore!!!!!,"I also purchased the Wal-Fart special Viore 42"" Plasma PDP42V18HA the day after thanksgiving. Mine crapped out today and Viore says basically I am SOL.No one will repair this TV locally.Never buy from Viore and stay out of Wal-Fart.Support you local shop owners."
5,ELVIS FAN,"AS AN ELVIS FAN, I LOVED THE VIDEO, ""VIVA LAS VEGAS"". ANN MARGARET & ELVIS TOGETHER WERE GREAT. LOVED THE SIGHTS OF LAS VEGAS & THE MUSIC. I LOVED THE SPECIAL EDITION WITH A BOOK OF PICTURES OF ELVIS & ANN MARGARET. I ALSO ORDERED ""BARBARELLA"" & RECEIVED A COPY WITH THE WRONG AREA CODE. OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT PLAY SO I RETURNED IT ASKING FOR A DVD THAT WOULD PLAY. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED THAT I AM GETTING A REFUND & NOT ANOTHER DVD THAT WOULD PLAY FOR ME. AMAZON HAS NEVER DISSAPOINTED ME BEFORE, THANK YOU FOR GOOD SERVICE. DALE CATLETT"
3,GOOD LOOKS GO A LONG WAY,"FRANKLY THIS IS NOT THE BEST ELVIS FILM AS MANY CLAIM.APRT FROM HAVING A KNOWN CO-STAR THIS FILM IS QUITE AVERAGE IN COMPARISON TO MOVIES LIKE KID CREOLE AND FLAMMING STAR.IN A NUT SHELL THE MUSICALS AND ELVIS'S CHARM GIVE THIS MOVIE THE HIGH RATINGS. THIS MOVIE RELIES ON SUCH SONGS AS ""THE GIRL LOVES ME',AND OTHERS TO GIVE IT THE ZEST REGARDLESS ELVIS IS CLEVER AND CHARISMATIC AS HE USUALLY IS IN ALL HIS MOVIES.SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ALL ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO REALLY HAVENT WATCHED ELVIS FILMS BECAUSE THIS FILM WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE ""MAINSTREAM"" OF ELVIS MOVIES . IN OTHER WORDS FUN ENTERTAINMENT FOR ALL AGES AND PEOPLE .YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CHOICE."
5,A Great Blu Ray Title,"What a beautiful,video transfer. It is like looking through a window. This is the first older movie I have purchased on Blu Ray and if they all look as good as this one I am afraid I am in trouble, as I will be rebuying a lot of Dvd,s."
4,Viva Las Vegas,"This DVD is good quality, well compressed with great color .The sound is also well done, with all songs sounding good. A good DVD as it has the movie in both Widescreen and Standard."
4,Energetic,"This movie seems a cut above the usual Presley picture, largely thanks to the energizing presence of Ann Margret. With her snazzy dancing, big numbers, and decent songs, Elvis seems to enjoy this one a bit. The plot is silly enough, but the whole thing is a fascinating time capsule. It even opens cinematically well with a long pan over the Las Vagas strip. The film's ending does seem extremely abrupt, as if they suddenly ran out of money or something, but it hardly matters in this live-for-the-moment funfest."
3,"Viva Las Vegus, Very Nice Movie!","Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley, with Great actors such as Ann-Margret, Cesare Danova, William Demarest. Great Music, Dancing and Songs. Elvis 7 Ann-Margret were Wonderful! I recommend this movie to all elvis Presley Fans! Great Collector Dvds."
4,Elvis and Ann Margaret frolic in Las Vegas,"This would be one of Elvis best movies. Lots of Las Vegas, lots of Ann Margaret, lots of Elvis. I think he enjoyed making this movie.A better story line than most of his so called movies."
5,VIVA LAS VEGAS {BLU-RAY},"This is my favorite Elvis movie. I like seeing 'Old Vegas', & the music is really good, especially the title track & Ann-Margret is one of the classiest & sexiest women of all time. What a sweetheart she is. The Blu-Ray quality on this movie I thought was pretty darn good. One of the better one's I have seen. Minimal grain & the color is beautiful. I can only say that the audio came across really nice considering I listen through external speakers run through my old fashioned stereo. Nothing fancy. For a 50 year old movie this came out really good. I can't recall ever seeing this movie quite like this. If you are an Elvis or Ann-Margret fan, you should add this to your collection. I don't think you will be disappointed."
2,Because of the accolades....,"I watched this movie and I confess, I do not get it. Let me preface this by saying, I love _Bye, Bye, Birdie_ --it is among my favorite movies as a child. So, after watching _Viva Las Vegas_ tonight, I rented via Amazon Prime, _Girl Happy_ (which I have not seen since the 60s). There is no comparison. Goofy and campy, yes, but at least it had a plot. So does _Blue Hawaii_ for that matter. Love the song, ""Viva Las Vegas"" but not the film."
2,Like picking at a Technicolor scab,"Despite the rave reviews from foreign lands, I found this film lacking both a coherent plot and a consistent, identifiable point of view towards its protagonist. Is ""Lucky"" Jackson a tragic victim of his own hubris or a hapless existentialist antihero who must choose between two equally pointless fates, laboring as a waiter or risking his absurd existence in the pitiless desert wastes, symbolic of the spiritual wasteland of Las Vegas? The filmmakers were apparently too lazy to decide or perhaps have left it up to the viewer. Robert Bresson's Au Hazard, Balthasar deals with many of the same themes in a more compelling fashion, although the donkey upon whom that film bases its narrative is not as hot-looking as Ann-Margaret. So it evens out more or less."
1,Viva Las Vegas,"I purchased several DVD's at the same time and all of them are in perfect condition except Viva Las Vegas. I've tried playing it on several different DVD players and my daughter's Xbox gaming system and it doesn't work. It's as if the DVD is blank. The box does state that the HD may not work on all DVD players depending on when they were purchased. However, my DVD player is an HD player and so is my daughter's Xbox but it doesn't even recognize anything on the disc. I would love to return it for a new one but I didn't save the packing slip so I didn't know where to send it."
2,elvis movie,I was disappointed in this movie because they cut a lot of the scenes. Especially at the end of the movie. It was like it was chopped off.
5,Viva,Great price for a classic DVD. I love this movie. It came in the mail quickly and in perfect condition. I recommend this wonderful seller.
4,"Cute film, er, musical...","I'm guessing this is the typical style of movies back then in the 60s which propel music stars into showbiz. I must say, for a film done during that period, this was particularly well made. Elvis Presley actually wasn't too bad. Ann Margaret is definitely talented (can sing, dance and act). It's even more entertaining to see that this film is a blatant excuse to sing a few songs and dance a few sequences. But I am a sucker for love stories, but it wasn't a bad use of an hour and twenty minutes of my time.The only thing I must confess to not liking what eventually happened to the Italian guy. How much more unapologetic can you get?LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 4 (everything's in verse or song - mostly. pretty cleverly done)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (car race at the end was pretty interesting)P (Plot) - 3 (there's the requisite love triangle and a horrible ending for one suitor)"
4,Widescreen Delight,"After years of second-generation VHS releases, ""Viva Las Vegas"" (1964) finally can be seen in a widescreen format. This Elvis Presley-Ann Margret musical looks and sounds great on DVD - and you also get the original trailer. With director George Sidney at the helm, it's easy to see why ""Viva Las Vegas"" is considered one of Presley's best films."
5,Outstanding!,The picture quality is off the charts. Sound is above average. This is a must have for any high def collection.
3,5 Star Movie but not so Deluxe Edition,"Special Features really lacking considering what was possible .No Commentary by Ann-Margret.No interviews with her or Teri Garr .No You're The Boss audio outake /cut duet number or the duet version of Today, Tomorrow & Forever .Not even the Ann's Margrock's Viva Rock Vegas.I guess we'll have to wait until they triple dip us on the Special Edition ."
4,a MUST for Ann Margaret fans!,"What can I say - ""It's an Elvis movie""! Despite Elvis' very simple acting capabilities (actually, he plays the ""pretty boy"" quite well, after all, he was very handsome), Ann REALLY shines! I forgot that she not only acts well, but sings and dances quite astonishingly in this movie. This film is intriguingly enjoyable while taking one on a journey to an era when shoes and handbags were the same color, and men wore slacks and/or suits every day! It may be ""corny"", but I really enjoyed this film with no sex or vulgar language with one of the most handsome men and beautiful women of the time! For the price, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!"
4,"The ""classic"" Elvis movie","Elvis movies deserve to be considered a genre all of their own. Although not Hollywood masterpieces that was never the point. They were a fun way of showcasing the talents of Elvis, think of them as extended music videos.""Via Las Vegas"" is one of the best of the genre. Ann Margaret is stunningly beautiful and a great dancer. Unfortunately her singing isn't as good as her dancing, however watching the scene stealing Ann Margaret can never be thought of as a chore. One of the best dance numbers is set at the University of Nevada campus, film buffs might want to see if they can locate Teri Garr amongst the troupe.The Vegas scenery from the 1964, including the neon ""Strip"" from the time, is fun to see. Even the desert car race, however improbable the action, has some great vistas too.This audio and visual quality of this reproduction is excellent, and fans and soon-to-be fans won't be disappointed."
3,I Want Season One,"I am a HUGE Reboot fan. It was a landbreaking series in digital animation. The characters were all well developed and the stories were well written. I was sad to see it get canceled and only recently learned that it had gone on to cable t.v. So I jumped at the chance to buy the entire series. I was so excited! I am sooooo disappointed that Volume One is NOT Season One. It is difficult for me to share it with others, as they have no background. Some of it is hard for me to understand too, since Bob was alive and kicking when I last saw the show.For all the fans of this awesome series -- I ask the producers to please release Seasons 1 & 2, so our collections will be complete. This is animation history."
5,The Best Cartoon Becomes More Mature,"With the departure of the censors, ReBoot defied the odds, and became even better. Without spoiling anything, I will simply state that the characters have to come to grips with some very hard times, and some losses of hope in light of a terribly evil individual, Megabyte. The first four episodes of Season 3 (To Mend and Defend, Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place, Firewall, and Game Over) detail young Enzo's emergency promotion to Guardian of Mainframe, and the responsibility that comes with it. At the same time, Megabyte uses every manipulative trick in the book to make the public hate Enzo. It begins in tragedy and ends in tragedy.It was about time this Computer-Animated show made it to DVD. Now all we need is for the first two seasons to follow suit."
2,Wasn't this on CBS?,I think this was on CBS a few years ago. I don't remember liking it all that much.
5,ReBoot is the Star Blazers of computer animated cartoons,"What can I say? I've been waiting for ReBoot to come out on DVD for many years now. This Canadian-produced gem is a true masterpiece combining eye-catching graphics, intriguing story-arc plot lines, and lots of inside jokes that us techie types love. ReBoot is a sign of good things to come, and is to today's computer-generated animation what Star Blazers was to Japanese animation.It's great entertainment for young and old alike!"
4,Not much to add,No sense in repeating what has already been said. This is simply a gorgeous album. Blackfield II is just that much better and deserves 5 stars. Highly recommend both albums. Can't wait for their live album cd/dvd to be delivered!
5,"Shorter tracks, still engaging.","Normally the lead singer is known for long tracks but he's been kept from going on too long and it still works. The songs are not too long but still take you on a journey and tell you a story. Audio quality is quite good, never sounding compressed or losing clarity."
5,one of the best out there,"Wow. Just when I started giving up on music, this came out.it's one of the best albums out there today. Wilson and Geffen are perfect together and the music is amazing!If there is one album you get this year or for the holidays, I'd make it this one.two thumbs up, wish I had more.The whole album is amazing from start to finish, a few songs to look out for are ""Blackfield"" ""pain"" ""cloudy now""it's an absolute must have!"
1,not a story book,bought this thought it was mini mysteries but this is for school use only or to put on a mystery play
5,The Titanic Series was great reading,"I enjoyed all the Titanic Series, whished there were more to read. They are exciting in a relaxed way. I had troble putting them down. Enjoy yourself and have a travel to a different day and time."
2,"Cute patterns, but bad errors","I am an experienced crocheter and I was also trying to do the mesh hat and I tried it 3 times before I realized that there is no way that they checked these patterns before they published them. There was no minor misstake, the pattern was totally wrong. I figured out some of it, but I didn't have the motivation to do anymore. Another big problem that I had is the sizing of the hats. They are written for 19 or 20 inch heads and there are no instructions for adjustments. The hats are very cute, but I would check the book out from the library if you can."
1,these patterns stink,I consider myself a intermediate when it comes to crochet. The pattern instructions are terrible. I tried the cloche with tie pattern five times and their is something missing in the directions. I would not recommend this book at all.
2,cute patterns; terrible instructions,"Some great hats by talented designers, but too many errors in instructions. So glad I checked Amazon and didn't waste any more time counting stitches that did not add up right. An inexperienced crocheter would be very frustrated with these instructions!"
3,BEWARE!!!,"I like crocheting hats, so I was delighted when I found this at the library. I leafed through it and saw plenty of nice hats I wanted to make. I've made three hats so far, and none of them went smoothly:*The Chain Mesh Cap is all wrong. Had they checked the pattern at all?*The Cap With Popcorns had some issues.*The ""Kilim Cap"" is full of mistakes. If I had followed the instructions exactly, it would have been cone-shaped, so dense your head would be sweating like mad, and the stripes would've been too wide. Somewhere along the line, I thought, ""this isn't going to work"" and decided to just work from the picture. It doesn't look perfect, but a whole lot better than it would have.Bottom line: the instructions in this book are really, really messed up. A shame, because the hats are so cute. You should only buy this book if you have plenty of crochet experience, and are up for a challenge."
1,Stay Away From This Disaster,"I did crochet the cover hat and it was OK. The helmet that so many have mentioned was a disaster. Yes, you can easily correct it as you are crocheting, but who wants to bother to write the instructions as you go?What is really humorous about this publication is in the copyright notice which states that you cannot make these hats for retail sale or you are violating their copyright.Well, I'll tell you, when you have to rewrite the instructions to be able to complete one of these hats, I think that copyright notice just goes out the window (which, btw, is not in the copyright code - that is just a bunch of hot air on their part)."
4,Fun and modern patterns,"Liked the patterns and the easy to follow instructions. Many friends have already borrowed this book and I had to purchase a second copy for myself. Cute hats for all ages and both sexes. If you like to make hats as gifts or to donate, you will find a lot of ideas in this little book."
3,Musical Mechanics,"This is a cute little book of direct copies of one of the early editions of this work. If you like Debussy's atmosferes and orchestal colors, having this blueprint can provide you with insights on how the magic it's done."
4,"Boring, but necessary.","I found this book next to impossible to get through when I had to read it for my theatre class. Unless you're good at holding one idea while reading another (because you have to remember what maxim applies to what situation as you read), the sage advice of Uta is almost unbearable to wade through. Almost my entire class agreed that she talked about herself for an inordinate amount of this piece. However, her advice is very wise, and if you can manage to figure it out and ignore the stuff that you might not need to know- such as experiences with two different ladies and their ways of handling some role- you will find yourself a better actor for the trouble."
5,Not For Those Just Browsing,"This is a deep, detailed work about the craft of acting. It is definately not for those just dabbling, as it will seem boring at best. But for those truly devoted to learning the craft, this is indespensible."
5,Truth Pours Forth,"The woman opens her mouth, and truth pours forth in this book. My mentor and friend strongly recommended this book to me (and to anyone who intends to make acting their life), and I cannot thank her enough. Uta Hagen's writing style is straightforward, no-nonsense and imbued with human warmth...and her book contains some of the best advice any actor could hope to receive."
1,Waited too long!!,The book took longer than the specified time to arrive. I requested information about shipping a few weeks after ordering but never received a reply. Eventually the book arrived wrapped in plain copy paper and tape almost a month after ordering. Another vendor may be the best choice!
2,Uta Hagen is a better actress than a writer; however...,"...fortunately for anyone who might want the benefit of some of the late Ms. Hagen's acting advice, her writing improved enormously and her second book 'A Challenge For The Actor' (published in 1991) shows her capacity to grow as a scribe as well as a thespian. I would recommend that an aspiring acting student, especially one who is early in his or her career purchase 'A Challenge For The Actor' instead of 'Respect For Acting' as is 'A Challenge For The Actor' far less muddled and obtuse than 'Respect For Acting'"
1,Not worth it!,"My husband and I live part-time in Italy and found a great deal of erroneous information in this book. We buy most books of this sort that are published on the off chance we will learn something new. However, the problems we found in this book make it difficult to trust any of the information it contains."
4,Great Book on the Theatre,"This book chronicles the 1964 Broadway production of Hamlet starring Richard Burton and directed by Sir John Gielgud. The author played Guildenstern in the production.Frank Rich (for 10 years the Drama Critic at the New York Times) called this his favorite book on an actor's perspective on mounting a play.I agree with Mr. Rich on this one. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars was to avoid overdoing my enthusiasm. (I'm worried people will notice that I am the author's son. Shush, don't tell anyone.)It got rave reviews at the time it came out and has pleased readers for over 30 years. It is both instructive and hilariously funny.Please request it at book stores, on line and write to Proscenium Publishing requesting another release.Thank youAdam Redfield"
5,A Theatre Classic!,"I read this book when I was in high school. More than thirty years later, I took it off the shelf and couldn't put it down. Wity and insightful, William Redfield's Letters from an Actor may be the best book I've read on what it's like to be a working actor in the theatre (I stress ""theatre"" beacuse Mr. Redfield has some interesting thoughts on film acting.) From frustrating rehearsals to nerve-wracking performances, this unique book puts the reader right on the stage with Mr. Redfield and the cast of Burton's Hamlet. Unfortunately, the theatre that William Redfield knew and loved no longer exists. Fortunately, this book captures an era --probably the end of it--when there was still an audience for dramas and comedies on Broadway, and still outstanding actors to perform in them. I can't think of a better theatre companion than William Redfield. This is a book the needs to be back in print. A great book and great fun!"
2,The Wind Blows Free,I was a little disappointed with the condition of the book as I was led to believe it was of good condition when in fact it was an old library book so the description of the book on the websight was misleading
5,an INCREDIBLY Vivid horror novel set on a cruise ship,"THIS is a MARVELOUS Horror story, that takes place on a cruise ship one mile high and file miles long sometime in the future. The ship is haunted and so will the reader become. The story is presented in a series of short stories, which make it a fascinating read, as the characters slowly intertwine. I highly recommend to fans of Poe, Barker, and King."
5,Excellent Introduction to All Facets of Image Processing,"Despite its small size, this book contains a wealth of information on the field of digital image processing. Topics include color space descriptions, filtering in the spatial and Fourier domains, image registration, and classification. The topics are introduced with minimal but clear mathematics - just right for the beginner. The text is similarly concise and clear. The examples and figures in this volume are well chosen and very helpful. The questions at the end of each chapter are helpful as well for understanding the topics.This book is a real gem for the beginning image processing student or practitioner."
2,Judy Moody predicts the future,Really fun and I loved reading and this book was really good and fun and I hope u will like it too
3,Get Judy moody books.,I like this series because they have lots of adventures. I gave this book three stars because it was kind of good. It is funny. I recommend other series.
4,What a book!,I like reading Judy Moody books because I like how Judy Moody acts and how she sometimes can be funny. The problem is that Judy Moody has a mood for every occasion. Judy thinks she has special powers of predicting people's moods. My opinion about this book is that Judy Is kind of funny and I like how she acts with her brother. She likes to call his brother skinky. She is also funny. When I first read this book I didn't like it but when I kept reading it I like it a lot and I can't wait to read her other books. I think you should read this book because it is a fantasy book and I like reading books that are fantasy because I like what they do and how they act. If you like reading fantasy book I reccomend you to read this book.
4,The Magic 8 ball,"This book has big writing and is easy to read. I liked this book because it is funny and interesting. Judy is always fighting with her little brother ""Stink"". I would not like to be like Judy because she is too moody and annoys people. My Dad says I am moody sometimes. I hope I am not as moody as Judy but it is good fun to read about her."
4,Very good instrumental mix of old and new,"THis is one of my top 3 bluegrass albums(my number one and two are Tony Rice the bluegrass guitar album and Ultimate pickin') What is kind of neat is this album is it is 50/50 old and new. I usually shy away from the older ones because of the poor recording equipment. But this one has ones I really liked (especially if you play). As far as the NEW sounding instrumentals, the Gold Rush and Jerusalem Ridge are just amazing!!! For the old ones, the kentucky colonels doing 9 lb hammer is very neat. The guitar and mandolin play about 14 different solos. Highly recommended, all instrumental music. Great album for someone like me who plays and goes to bluegrass jams and festivals."
1,cult of the crap,"this has got to be the worst dvd I ever purchased. I saw this on the big screen when it played the theaters in 1979 or 80. so I was familiar with the story and the screen version. when I saw this originally it rather disturbed me. I found the whole jim jones story creepy and the films fleshed out disturbing images for me.so I bought the dvd thinking it was the one I had seen on screen.no way what was on the disc looked liked a butchered copy of the late late late show. the editing was obviously censorship so it appears the dvd was taken from a televison print.what a rip off. the cuts where very apparent. like the film was being toned down. not that I am praising the gore and violence in the movie,but I feel if a movie is for sell it should the whole movie in its orginal form. or at least warn the public they are buying an edited version which shouldnt be for sale in the first place."
1,forget it....,"..the only fairly good scene has been edited out. Or, if you have to see it, you have 115 looooonnnngggggg minutes to try to figure our what happened to the excellent actor Stuart Whitman's career, and did fine actors like Gene Barry and Joseph Cotton need the money (what there was of it) that badly?"
1,Possibly worst movie ever?,"Guyana: Crime of the Century - Cult of the DamnedTerrible movie! Bad acting, bad directing! Character of ""Jim Jones"" not even close!! This ""Jim Jones"" was always angry in this movie -- over the top angry! This character could NEVER have commanded such a following. I should have been clued in when they changed the peoples' names and the name of the ""Temple"" to protect who????????? I destroyed the disk and used the case. It was more valuable. A much better choice would be ""Guyana Tragedy."" This movie was much better in all respects!!!"
2,U get what U pay 4!,"I dont get it....some people are praising this camera for its battery life, do you people ever turn on the LCD? I get about 20 pictures per set of fresh alkaline. I don't think the camera is defective simply because it has a 1.25 amp current rating. I wouldn't expect 4 AA batteries to maintain that output for very long. I turned to my RC-Car hobby for a solution, and constructed a 6 volt battery pack using 5, 1500mha sub-c ni-cad cells. Then went to radio shack and found the appropriate connector to plug into the ac-power jack. now I easily get 100 pictures while using the LCD, and best of all.. the sub-c ni-cads only take 10 minutes to charge.also.... the picture quality is severely lacking, and cant even compare to scanned 4x6 prints taken with my 35mm. The only thing I like about this camera is the price."
4,very good pictures - but a few handicaps,"I bought the camera as a bundle with the P1000 printers. The pictures are outstanding. I use the camera also, in order to archive my color slides. Operates great. The pictures with mid accuracy are sufficient - with this the camera can store 40 pictures. The loading time into the computer lasts for a very long time, but that is not a problem, if you have the P1000 printer, because that one can read the Flash cards. A little problematic is the handling: Some functions (zoom, brightness, etc..) can only be adjusted over the menu in the color display, others over the display above at the camera. On the whole a super camera. I enjoy it much. The purchase was worthwhile itself in any case."
4,Excellent Camera,This camera takes excellent pictures.The 2X Zoom feature is handy but would be better at 4X. Battery life without a card reader tends to be short. When combined with a reader then the battery life is good. I have taken 1000's of pictures with this camera and could never be more pleased
2,Lasted Only 9 Months!,"I was happy with this camera when i first purchased it. Now Icould kick myself for spending ($) on a camera that only lasted 9 mos! Camera was terrific for the 9 mos that it worked. Now it will no longer load the pics into my PC. The camera is still under warranty (1 yr) but after seeing the nightmare that comes from HP support from other reviewers here on Amazon, Im not expecting that HP will honor their warranty and provide me with a camera that works properly. We will see. ..."
2,Very Disappointing Zoom!,"This camera's zoom is just about useless. It is a ""digital zoom"" which means you must have the LCD panel on to use the zoom, wasting precious batteries. Plus, it is not a real zoom - it's a telephoto. You are either zoomed in or zoomed out, but there is no in-between.If all you want is a point and shoot digital camera, it seems to me there are lots of other ones out there for a lot less money. ...."
1,Horrible Pictures when compared to other cameras,"When I first viewed the pictures taken with this camera I thought they were pretty good. But when I started testing other cameras, even cameras below $300, I found the picture quality taken with this camera inferior to the others. Most pictures came out blurry and all lacked the detail that other cameras produce.Not a good camera to buy."
2,Not as good as other similarly priced cameras,"I also received a deal that allowed me to get afree 15 MB flash card with the camera which made it appear to be abetter deal. However, the photo quality was not that great and the camera itself a little clunky. I wasn't satisfied with the camera at all. I did, however find a wonderful camera that I like a lot. Try the Olympus D-340R for similar pricing with better quality photos."
2,I must have got a faulty camera...,"After reading the reviews here, I am perplexed. I have had major problems with this camera since day one. I bought the camera 7 months ago and: 1) the flash has stopped working, 2) the adapter plug will not stay in the socket which means I have to hold it in while I take pictures (not easy to do!) or else tape it on and 3) the batteries only last long enough to take about 20 pictures. The quality of the photos are acceptable but using the camera is often a nightmare. I do not enjoy using it."
1,Very fragile,"Nice camera, but a drop of about 2 feet [messed] up the electonics - really. Although camera was almost new, HP would not honor warranty as any drop, no matter how slight, was considered an accident."
1,Very Disappointed,"Within six months of purchasing product it had problems. I was unable to down load pictures. HP had lots of attitude because I'd purchased online. Eventually got that problem fixed, then a few months later it stopped working all together.Their products don't hold up and HP's support is terrible.What a waist of money."
4,Great first digital camera!,"I really like the point and shoot features of this camera. I learned immediatly not to use the LCD to conserve batteries. I also learned that if you close and reopen the lens cover the battery display will return to""full""! I can't seem to judge when to take action photos! By the time the shutter opens the action is over! This may just be my inexperience. I would recommend this camera to learn the features to look for in your next digital camera! I use a jumpshot reader which works great(the serial download is painfully slow) I also bought a Tiffen telephoto, wide angle and closeup lens kit - what a hoot! they really work great! I use this to record construction projects."
5,It's been a great camera!,"I bought this camera for Christmas in 1999, not sure whether or not I would like a digital camera. Since that time, I've taken more pictures than I ever have before. I've used it to take snapshots, pictures of my family for my web pages, Christmas cards, even with a tripod for a family picture, using the self-timer. Sure, now, there are newer cameras with better resolution and more features, and I would like to own one of those, also, but I can't see living without this. It's so easy to use, and it has stood the test of time."
2,uploading to computer,"I don't have a lot of good words so far for the Hewett- Packerd company, as I have been trying to get my C200 to work with Windows-2000 and they seem to be giving me the run around. My computer won't take my pictures from the camera. They sent me an e-mail, telling me to uninstall my software and reinstall it, which I did, and now it says it can't find the camera! Otherwise, I love the camera, as it is easy to use and takes wonderful pictures, also is compact therefore easy to carry around!"
4,Great Quality - No Battery Problems,"I have taken shots with a minolta slr and these pictures are very close in quality. 8x10 and 5x7's come out with no picture quality reduction like you get with some regular film (depending on asa). I've taken about 40 shots, used the lcd and downloaded a couple times and still on the original batteries. Use the HP premium plus or other heavy weight photo paper for best printing results. I bought the p1000 printer also. I'd highly recommend this. Only drawback IMO is the digital zoom. Since you're looking through a viewfinder and not the lens, you don't see what the zoomed picture looks like and there's no button on the camera for zoom...you have to go into the lcd/menu on the back of the camera to select the zoom...very awkward. Great camera for the price and seriously, you won't be able to tell the difference between regular camera pics and these...just get a good printer and good paper to go with it."
4,Great feature to price ratio!,For all of you that are reading the reviews that the batteries die too often....they don't people just cannot seem to put two and two together that the lcd screen WILL drain their batteries. Just take pictures w/o the lcd and then use it when you have to.....the battery life on this camera is great. So when you see or read a review that says battery life is bad......USER ERROR is the major cause. I would recommend this product highly.
3,No AC Adapter!,"If you get this camera, make sure you get a bloody AC adapter with it. The camera will eat new batteries in a day, and the adapter itself is imposible to find. The HP web page will not warn you of this, and charges $50 for an adapter. I hate HP right now."
1,Not supported by Win2000,"I bought the c200 a month ago,but since then i could not download images to my computer since i run win2000 and the c200 does not support this OS. I emailed HP but there was no answer...I looked for w2k driver in their web site,but there were only drivers for Win95/98.I am TOTALY unhappy with this product and from the ""support"" HP provide. Every time i see the camera i swear that this is the LAST product of HP that will be entering my home !!"
4,"Camera Great, Battery lousy","I bought the C200 last Xmas. Works great, specially for my work, I am an electric contractor and It is great to add pictures to my reports, with no problem. Big difficulty I have is batteries. I have used it with a set of rechargeable batteries for more than 600 pictures, but have to recharge them: before taking the pictures, then before unloading to PC. Normal alkaline batteries lasts 20 pictures mid res. Thanks for review about Sony AC adapter. Great to see pictures on TV. My friends are fascinated about this gadget and I am short of time to copy all pictures via email to them."
2,Battery Life Makes It Nearly Unusable...,"This camera works fine. Takes good pictures.Drawbacks other than battery life:1. Only 1 pic review at a time as opposed to a collage review by the Olympus brands.2. Long delay from the time you hit the photo button and get a picture causes folks to relax before the pic is taken. Ruins some shots.3. Very clunky camera considering it has no optical zoom.Now, the battery life. I have yet been able to fill my flash memory without having to change batteries. I get about 10 -15 pictures before it is flashing and beeping to tell me the battery is dead. This makes the camera unacceptable, and I am looking for a new one solely for this reason."
3,A good Bill Dogget release,"It's good, but not great.. Understand, Mr Doggett did not always have a choice in what to record.. The record label head (mr Nathan) often wanted a ""hit"" or, at least, a ""moneymaker"" for his label, and back in the '50s, that meant shlock..Bill Doggett was one of his primo ""producers"", in fact right up there with Sonny Thompson and Gene Redd (although, unlike those two, who were simply studio musicians, he released records under his own name).. in fact he was committed to the label (King) right through it's entire lifetime (until Syd Nathan died)..Some of his releases might only appeal to diehard Doggett fans (such as me), but I have never heard a *bad* one..However, this one is definitely ""MOR"", along with ""as you desire Me"" and other sappy, or ""soft"" relases.Now, of course, in my quickly encroaching old age, I have found I like these.. but a jazz purist just might not, although I would advise any jazz diehard to still have this and any other doggett releases, anyways/"
2,Sounded like a fast paced toy,"I bought this for Christmas for my 3 and 4 yr old girls. They played with it once, and the balls take way too long to pop out of the holes, and when they do, they just sort of roll out. I thought this would be a fast paced toy that they could run around and keep picking up the balls, but it is way too slow. Maybe my 8 mo old will enjoy the little bug just walking around on the floor."
4,Not good for children who still put things in their mouth!,"I thought this would be a really fun toy for my child. Maybe a good indoor, active game for winter.I invited a friend over that was 2 years old and he continued to put the balls into his mouth. The ball has vent holes in it. But still could be a real concern.The game is noisy on hard floors! Buy ear plugs also!"
3,Cute but......,"My 5 year old daughter got this for Christmas and it's cute, but the balls don't come out fast enough to make it a challenge for her or her friends. She still likes it and thinks it's fun, but she only played with it for about 10 minutes the first time. Overall I'm not impressed, but she likes it so that's all that really matters to me. I gave it's educational rating 2 stars simply because it helps strengthen playing with others. It looks well made which I appreciate.....and that's why I gave it highest marks in durability."
5,Easy to read and fundamental,This book is very easy to read and has some fundamental ideas for amateurs. I recommend this for any kind of photographer.
5,Adams writes about photography as well as he photographs,"This excellent book of essays reveals much about the motivations of photographers and provides thought-provoking subjects relative to a life in photography. Adams' writing is straightforward and insightful and an excellent inspiration in a sometimes confusing, but mysterious art."
4,Not Just Photography,"I enjoyed the 3/4 of this book that dealt with photography. The last 1/4 was a treatise on environmentalism. Much of this was written more that 20 years ago and is outdated. For example Adams states that Republicans encourage illegal immigration while liberals want it halted. Today, 20 years later, the opposite seems to be true. Who knows what the political landscape will be 20 years from now. I enjoyed most the essays on various photographers."
1,Avoid if sold by Planet Stuff,"Same issue as other reviewer - gel inside has dried up. Avoid if sold by ""Planet Stuff"". Vendor either has a bad batch or is re-selling returned/defective items. 0 for 2."
5,Excellent,"My sister found this book and it covers the ground. The medication issue for our mother is very serious. I'm glad there are ""experts"" out there on this subject because you can really feel alone and at a loss."
1,What a waste of time!,"This is a horrible documentary A socialist fueled, blow hardy, love affair with this communist killer. This piece of crap film is filled with one sided interviews and the absolute worst subtitles I've ever seen on film-full of misspellings and bad grammar. Don't waste your time."
1,TEDIOUS,"THIS IS NOT GAY FICTION! ""Gay"" is used here in the context of 1890's ""gay"". Whoever categorized this work should be shot.I read the first chapter thinking he'll meet a guy on the next page, or the next page. Unh uh. Not in this work. Then I started skimming. You can get most of story by just reading the quoted dialogue. The author does a nice job of portraying the moral/social dilemmas and manners of late nineteenth century London society but unless you are fond of tedious lengthy internal monologues about a gentleman's moral standing when he finds himself thinking of holding a ladies hand (lot of thinking about doing and very little doing in this work) then I do not recommend this work."
5,Franquin's Spirous are the Best,"I've read all Spirou's books 15 years ago and definitely Franquin's ones are unbeatable. Unfortunately you won't find the same imagination and humour inside the other authors'books. Nowadays, you only find Franquin's books in french. Why, if they have the other not so cool books print in english and portuguese, and probably spanish, italian..? I used to find those books in portuguese in Portugal's bookstores back then. Kim Thompson, please do us a favor. Translate all the other Franquin's books to english.I wish my kids will have the same joy of reading Spirou as I had...and Tintin, Asterix, and Blake & Mortimer. Real, flesh and bone heroes, full of humour and wit."
5,One of the Best European comics,"This is so far the only translated book of Franquin whoDraw and wrote in French few beautiful serie like GastonFantasio and Spirou, Le petit Spirou, etc... This youronly chance to read one of his book in English."
2,Great opportunity compromised,"The material on this disc is excellent. But seeing it was very painful for me for two reasons. What I heard over the entire interview was not the voice of Fischer-Dieskau but a voice-over narrator. This is a truly reprehensible practice. The producers should have preserved the original voice of the artist, with English subtitles for those of us who do not know German. A similar problem plagues the almost ninety-minute long Schubert recital. It is a wonderful recital, but without subtitles. This is inexcusable, given the capabilities of the DVD technology. I have the DVD of F-D singing Schubert's Wintereise, and the subtitles immeasurably add to the overall experience.This is unfortunate. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is the greatest lieder singer of his generation, and deserves better presentation than this disc provides."
1,Mediocre comedy routines from the ultimate genius of comedy.,"We love Sid Caesar. We were impressed by the service provided by the company which sent it. The actual product had a clear picture, and excellent sound. The content, however, was mediocre. These tapes showed us his grade B routines."
2,ugh!!,"these shoes LOOK nice, but the pair i got were not true to size, kind of...i bought them for a wedding and did not have time to exchange them (i wear an 8.5 and was skeptical about switching these for a 9.5 anyhow)...the right one fit better than the left, and they were ok when i put them on, but were PAINFUL within a half hour...i've never had shoes that felt like they fit but hurt so bad before..."
5,I enjoyed this book very much. It is worth finding.,This is a very intriguing book about a little boy and the story of his life.
1,Sickening cowardice and narcissism,"Why books like this continue to get published is beyond me. The author is a not very interesting sad case. Having washed out of Marine Corps OCS he turns against the entire United States and its armed forces. The story is one of personal cowardice in search of a moral justification which the author is pathetically unable to provide. Why publishers remain obsessed with deserters and antiwar protestors remains a mystery to me; I'd rather read about the heroism of the men who served in Vietnam. I'd like to invite the author to come to any of the many military unit reunions held every year in the US to celebrate the brotherhood and comradeship of those of us who answered our country's call in its hour of need, some reluctantly but all did their duty. Come and see what you missed; the hollow sense of shame that pervades your book will be easier to understand."
2,Nun Sense Las Vegas,"We have the first Nun Sense video, and the latest production is nothing like the first one. It lacks timing and the energy of the first one. It seems to have a good technical staff, but the director tries too hard to make the slower script and humor reach the quality of the first one. We didn't watch it all of the way thru."
5,Horror novel that would make a great low-budget movie,"A serendipitous used-book find for me, this horror thrillerhas it all the melancholy British bogs, the estrangedvillagers, the evil Baron, the evil Beauty, the Monster --not to mention sex, history, suspense, and a father's protective love for his son. No flat spots in this book. The setting is believably woven through all the senses, so that when the Monster makes an appearance, you're a believer. The description of the bog bodies is realistic enough to make you shiver, and that's not even the horrific part."
1,Dont bother,"I have always been fascinated by the ""bog bodies"", because of the state of thier preservation and the history surrounding these poor souls. This book isnt scary, it isnt creepy, it isnt even original nor is it informative. Its sappy, benign and boring. The occult? demons who defecate dogs and turn into beautiful women? Yawn."
2,Too Verbose and Unorganized for Medical School,"The book is disjointed and doesn't do a good job explaining the pathways- especially when you get to the Cranial Nerves. I agree with the other medical student reviewing this book- too verbose and way too confusing for most medical students. I think professors like to believe it's a good book b/c it goes into laborious details. However, neuro is hard enough without. I wouldn't waste my time b/c you will get more confused simply trying to read the book! Stick woth the notes and a concise study guide."
5,New only one book for Neuroanatomy,"I love this book because it takes figures from some of the best atlases, like Neuroanatomy and Atlas and Text, which I also own. The book, however, takes a significant time commentment, but well worth it to develop a solid understanding of neuroanatomy and neurology."
5,clear and useful,"I'm a first year neurology resident and the book is really helpful in the daily clinical problems, being a fast way of reviewing neuroanatomy. I also got very satisfied with the delivery service: it arrived in Brazil in 14 days in excelent conditions!"
3,Good service,The book arrived earlier than expected and was in good condition. I was very happy with the service.
5,This is a book for every student or physycian in neurology,This book ofers a fantastic link between anatomy and clicical pratice.This is a corner stone book for all neurolgists and people interested in this field.
5,work great,"I take 2 in the am and 2 in the pm before bed and it helps a ton. I sweat a ton and now I sweat about half as much. Takes a week or few to fully work, but it does help."
5,Sage for hot flashes works,The order came in excellent condition and in a timely matter. And...it's working!! I'm using it to manage hot flashes and I would say that I'm having 90% less.
2,Poor Support,"While the concept of the Onyx Satellite is a step forward in terms of portability in a good system with excellent preamps, the customer support that Mackie provide is almost non-existant. Have Vista? Forget this interface, Mackie seem to have stated on the support forums both that they're working on a driver and that they aren't going to make a driver, which fills me with little hope that one is on the horizon any time soon. No 64-bit support either. I could not even get it to install on my 64-bit Vista machine. The forums are the only easily accessible support mechanism, their website unsubtly states that their phone support won't be much of a help.Great hardware, but great hardware isn't of much use when you can't use it, and especially when once it doesn't work there's not really anywhere to go for real help from the manufacturers. Took it back to the shop and got an Edirol, which are one of only a few manufacturers with 64-bit Vista support."
1,Poorly engineered electronically - Bleeding among tracks in the box,"It is not a software problem... The monitor feed that goes into the headphone amp and the input channels bleed. They use a multi-pin connector that has a limited life (500 total connections, more appropriate for inside a mixer, not inside a to-be-removed module!!!)Lots of problems on other things too. Many on the Mackie BBS complained about this unit.Great pre-amps and routing, missing MIDI so, if it worked, it still wasn't perfect but coulda-shoulda-woulda..."
3,Nice book but lacks a info for the young and hip traveler,"Great book if you plan to visit Munich and visit every castle and cathedral in the city but where is the information on hip nightclubs, fab restaurants, the hotels to be seen in, etc? Again, it was a great history type book for me and it was VERY well made, slick covers, a few nice maps, great photos, but again, for the young hip traveler who wants info on nightlife, there wasn't any. Hotels and restaurants are merely listed in the back and rated by price, with no photos."
4,good internal stuff,"I was suprised by what this book contained. I was expecting a, do step 1, then do step 2, then 3, etc. kind of book. This book is an internal martial arts book. I had been trying to do research on internal arts to combine with my external styles. I had come up with some pretty good stuff i thought. I tried to eliminate all the unpractical stuff and come up with a foundation that would work well. This book has done that. It has also helped me fill in some of the gaps I was missing in my attempts. This book is more of a ""way"" of doing things rather than a step by step manual.If you combine the stuff in this book with other styles or techniques you may know, it can be vishious."
1,Matthew temkin,"For authors who claim to teach simple self defense their methods are rather complicated and some of the preachings are overly esoteric. Some good info here, but how many techniques are really needed ( or can be made reflextive) for pratical self defense?"
1,Too advanced for beginners.,"This book might be useful for those who have a self-defense training background, but it will not help a beginner."
4,"NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AN ""INTRODUCTORY"" TEXT!!!","This was a good book, but by no means is it intended for beginners! A lot of complex esoteric stuff like advanced methods for raising and directing energy. The techniques are sound, but will need to be practiced over and over again -- with training partners -- in order to have any hope of being effective. I would not recommend this book unless you are already well-versed in the fundamentals of a soft style like Aikido, Wing Chung, or Taijiquan. Harder styles like Hapkido, Ju Jitsu, and Tang Soo Do also can be applied to the methods endorsed in this book. A clueless citizen looking for a ""self defense"" book would be completely lost. Very advanced concepts."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I grew up in this region and I can tell you, this book did not ring true to me at all. I read all the wonderful reviews and I held high hopes for the book. I felt it was completely dis-jointed and a huge disappointment. This is only the second book in my life that I felt like I was sorry I had wasted my time by reading it. Maybe the 'high literary' content was just lost on a country girl. This is not descriptive of the people of the region - sorely disappointing."
4,a great storyteller,"William Gay is one of the best southern writers around. HJe makes characters and usses dialouge that is so rich and true to the south that I feel transported. That is why I was a little dissapointed when some of the characters lapsed into some modern diaougue. OVerall, the important thing is that Mr. Gay has once again developed characters that are well-rounded and often quite evil. The main story is about a wwandering father and his three sons and their sons. It takes two generations for anyone to give E.F. Bloodworth any respect and that is only really from Fleming, the youngest grandson. The characters of Brady and Neal are so realistiic though in their meanness, because look at their gene pool! E.F. would kill anyone in his youth, and left them all to raise themselves."
5,"Wonderful characters, terrific prose","William Gay's Provinces of Night was one of the best new novels I have ever read. I laughed out loud in parts, especially at the situations that Junior Albright found himself in. Fleming was my favorite character, with Junior and Julia close seconds. The characters were so genuinely described that I could picture their physical appearances throughout. The only criticism I have is the use of the term ""black"" when Raven Lee was talking about E.F.'s music. In the 1950's, in the South, it would have been insulting to use such a word (the term African-American had not yet been coined) The more accepted and sensitive term was ""colored"", or ""Negro"", provided that was pronounced correctly. Anything else would have labeled a white person as ignorant. I understand Gay's desire to be politically correct, but it was the one area that did not ring true in this otherwise authentic work."
3,"Good to Read, Good to Know","I read Gay's first novel, The Long Home, and thought that, as well as being a good story, its language captured the East Tennessee rural folk as well as any I'd ever seen in print. No, William Gay's not William Faulkner, and I'm not Bennett Cerf, but Provinces of Night is a good Southern novel. Seventeen year old Fleming Bloodworth is probably a little too good to be totally believed, but there is something in his character that rings true, something that reminds me of my own dad. There are many men who have walked out from behind mules in East Tennesse and managed to make their ways in a world they were not born in nor raised to. There are many others who were never able to make that transition. You don't get to choose your own roots, but they don't have to strangle you either."
3,Where Did All The Vigor Go?,"Provinces of Night has so much beauty and humor that I want to praise it to high heaven. Old E.F. Bloodworth is such a salwart character that one can almost feel his presence even when he isn't in the scene. Mr. Gay's narrative is simply breathtaking. The language of the characters themselves, however, is big city street, even the women's. Did small town southeners really use that brand of profanity in the early fifties? Another little problem is with the ending. I hate to see such a robust book just dissolve away in uncontested bleakness. Why couldn't one or two of these fine characters have stood up and given one last roar? I thought to myself, they lord..."
4,"Even more affecting than ""The Long Home""","Stunning in the gracefulness of its language and palpability of its characters. Absolute beauty. Every book I ready by William Gay or Larry Brown seems better than the last. This novel will envelope you in the swirls of its delicate, pungent smoke."
2,"Pleasant read, but a bit predictable.","I liked much better the first installment of the series and was disappointed by this one. The story was quite flat and predictable and some pieces didn't fall together well. Like the super rational Kendrick, revealing to Haven (who he believes to be a traitor and an enemy), that he's in possession of one of the caliches and then he sends her away, putting at great risk his family and his mission."
3,track is cool,i like this game because i love track and field! if u at least patricipate in it and like these sports u will like this! try it out!
4,"OK, OK, four and a half stars","My one-and-a-half year old got this package from her aunt and uncle. She loves all three books, but The Lady With the Alligator Purse and Skip to my Lou in particular. My only real complaint is that the music is on a cassette, not a CD, so I can't play it in my car (though I suppose that may be a blessing of sorts), and I can't skip a track easily. Also, with just three songs it can get a bit repetitive, though my daughter is totally unconcerned about such quibbles. Be warned: the songs are infectious, and will get stuck in your head for days and days. Still, great fun for all."
1,Sing Along Songs 2 & 3,"These books are wonderful, BUT why is a tape included & not a CD? Who has a tape player anymore?"
5,A pure fantasy joy ride,"I have been an avid fantasy reader since Tolkein captured my attention with his masterpieces. This is one of the few I've read that can even hold a candle to his works. I have been browsing a used book store for quite sometime looking to fill my hungar for good fantasy novels. I found this book and immediately bought it and dove into the wonderous story. I didn't know how lucky I was to find this untill I discovered it was out of print. It is a true gem for any literary library. If you like dragons, magic, princesses and fantasy this book is a must read."
1,A waste of paper,"I bypassed this book for years on the shelves.. It'd catch my eye, then I'd lay it back down again after reading the back. Finally I picked it up, figuring with those two authors it couldn't be that bad. I was quite wrong. It was much much worse.A cliche ridden book of hobbit-types and dragons. It was done much better by Tolkien and others. Don't waste your money."
4,Childhood Classic,"I read this novel when I was in grade school. It stuck with me into adulthood and I decided to give it a reread to see if it was as good as I remembered. I am pleased to say that it holds up well. A generic title aside, this is a wonderful read. It is a tragedy and a misunderstanding that brings two nations to war, set against the backdrop of the twilight of the age of Dragons. This is the perfect book to get a young person into fantasy."
3,"Great car seat for size, but...","This is a great car seat for size. My baby was born weighing 9 lbs 9.6 oz., so I know he will reach the weight limit of other seats before he is a year old. He is also long, so the fact that this seat goes to 32 inches is helpful. I do find that the material is very hot. He sweats in it even if it is not a hot day. I have to put a blanket or cloth between him and the seat so he doesn't sweat. Because it is so big, it does not fit on top of grocery carts or in restaurant booths or in highchairs at restaurants. All in all it is a good seat and it is easy to install."
4,great car seat,"This is a very nice car seat. The pattern is very pretty. I like the fact that I can use this until he is a year old since it goes up to 30lbs. The only downside is that he will be to heavy to actually carry him in this, but I guess you can just leave the car seat installed in the car. Also it is a little bit bigger than a regular car seat. I have an SUV and my seat has to be up further than I would like in order to be able to get the seat in and out of the base. All in all I would recommend this seat."
2,Way too big and heavy,I have a newborn and this seat is just too darn big in my opinion. She looks so uncomfortable and it is SO heavy and hard for me to handle. I really regret this purchase.
2,Not for newborns,"My son was 8lbs 8 oz at birth and this seat still seemed huge for him. We've positioned the seat reclined as much as is allowable, and it's still too much of an incline. We've got the head support installed, and we've even tried additional head support, but his head just won't stay up. My solution has been to always have a 2nd person ride in the back seat and make sure his head doesn't fall forward. I can't imagine this is a safe position if we were in an accident. I'm highly considering returning this and buying a typical infant seat. On the positive side... we love the weather guard at his feet and the cannopy. THey're great features!"
3,Seems to be working... albeit in a very marginal way,"I bought this antenna booster without much expectations really. My cubicle for some reason has very bad reception for my already weak phone (the Nokia 5310 has the crappiest of antennas). There were even times when I had ZERO bars on the indicator. Usually it's about one or two bars only.The thing is, since I got this booster I haven't had zero bars at any time. I still average about one or two bars though. So far it seems the signal has a very marginal improvement (from sometimes zero to at least one bar), but I have to accept that the improvement is there."
1,Disappointing,Did nothing to improve lousy reception. 14 more words required? don't have the time time time time time time time
1,Waste of money,These mini strobe lights were purchased for a birthday party to add a little excitement with the strobe light. This product is not worth a penny. The colored lens that come with it do not stay on and it does not put out much light at all. Very disappointed.
2,Slow Strobe,"My daughter wanted a strobe light to make it look like she was moving in slow motion. This one totally failed for that application. The strobe pulses were too slow to allow this effect, even when the speed dial on the light was at max. So... it definitely functioned as a strobe light, but it was not what we wanted or were looking for."
5,Beggin' for Love,"I initially bought this CD for ""Here's a Heart"" all my friends seem to know this song from the intro ""OOOOO-AHHHH-AHH"",but then after hearing the rest of this CD i realized i had stumbled on more than i thought,i wish that i could've seen them as well as other groups from this era,i can only imagine how entertaining these shows were. i do recomend purchasing this CD"
4,...,"I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is into punk/rock and is looking for something a little different. I discovered Prozac + when a friend of mine brought back their CD from Italy.. I have been listening to them ever since. You will find yourself singing along in no time, even if you don't know the Italian language!"
4,Do you know you historical figures?,"This is a great collection of short stories. Combines history with the mystery of just who the author is writing about, which you don't discover until the end of each story. Informative, interesting and keeps you guessing. Most importantly you learn how people overcame their failures to become successful."
1,A limited analysis,"After reading great books on privelge and gender (see, Privilege, Power, and Difference by Allan G. Johnson), seeing a book like this is a great dissapointment. The author is still stuck in the narrative she alleges to be challenging. But, in her defense, it is not her fault; she is simply the product of our male dominated culture. She attacks others because she is trying to emulate the male power model and rise above the positions of servitude the vast majority of women in our world are still relegated into. Another sad comment."
1,Crude,"Equality is good, but she DOES write like a high school bully; very crude, rude, and self-centered; threw it in the garbage, 10-minutes into the second night I picked it up. Low-class trash, don't waste your time! In light of her latest comments to the media, I thought it was a good time to write a review about her so-called ""writing""... garbage."
3,I like the red handles and the $7.99 price.,Wilton makes a cheaper set of heart shapes in metal but I think these are more tactile friendly. I love poking my finger through the handle to push the cookie dough off the cutter. Fun!
5,"At last, a quality plastic cookie cutter!","Now that I have granite counterops, I am in a constant state of paranoia that I will mar them. I bake regularly so the solution was a rol pat, a large silicone sheet made by the silpat people that is perfect for rolling out pastry. One problem: no sharp edges allowed.So my collection of metal cutters are useless. Plastic cookie cutters are not easy to find and tend to be flimsy. I like to buy something once and have it for a lifetime of use if possible. I was so pleased with these cutters that I ended up buying every shape available. With the ongoing 4-3 offer that's a free set! I love the way they stack neatly in the drawer and don't rattle around. Perfect for the motorhome, lightweight and unbreakable. They cut beautifully and the cookies come out with perfect edges, no tearing. Give them a try."
4,$9.95 for the best design,I wish these would go on sale like the heart version. It is so much fun to poke the cookie dough off through the hole in the handle. Dook!
2,a sign of better things to come,"yo la tengo had to make the weakest album of their career to become what they've been since 'painful'. james mcnew came along, putting a stop to revolving-door bassists, thus solidifying ylt as a self-sufficient trio(the most important single event in yo la tengo history). ira learned to let it all out on guitar, and georgia's vocal and songwriting role expanded.the album has some incredible songs. one of ylt's best moments comes on the georgia's pastoral opener 'detouring america with horns,' that grabs a feelies vibe and runs with it. 'five cornered drone' is half a ylt feedback epic,(can you say ""i heard you looking""?)the rest is spotty, somewhat caught in the middle, with only 'satellite' fully registering. this is an essential piece of ylt history, necessary for full understanding of the groups development. highly recommended for all big fans. casual listners might want to find it used/bargain bin just for ""detouring america"""
4,"One of the most remote parts of the world, but well worth it","I recently completed a trip across the length of the Karakoram highway, and found this guide book excellent. It provided a lot of useful background on the different people and cultures whom we encountered, and had great information on the various towns and villages along the way. It was particularly helpful to have the phrasebook section at the back with all the different languages of the region. This is a wonderful part of the world to visit, but not the easiest to travel in, so a book like this makes all the difference."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A poor woman, struggling to get by, comes to the notice of the overlordof the city, and sees in her a useful aide, to help him in hispolitical struggles and control of the power source that runseverything, plasm. She is struggling to support herself and her familybefore this, so it at least helps her financial situation, if not herlongevity."
5,Aiah is one of the best female characters in recent SF,"I love Aiah. She is one of the great overacheiving heroines of SF. And she does it all with just a to-do list, a business degree, and the occasional killer pedicure!"
4,Very pleased.,The product I received was as stated in the advertising. The order was handled efficiently and I received it in a timely manner. I am please with the results of buying from Amazon.
5,LOVE!,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! They are soooooo comfy, and perfect in winter or summer!!! It is all we wear in our house LOL"
5,Criminally comfortable,These are the most comfortable shoes I ever put my feet in. They're so comfortable I feel like it's probably not allowed and I'm getting away with something. Like I'm sitting at my desks in socks or something - but no one looks at me funny. Because they're shoes.It's like I won the shoe lottery.
5,Love them!,"They will stretch a little, so go down in size when ordering. But I wear them everywhere and have ordered several more sanuks!"
2,Sanuk Donna Sidewalk Surfer Black,"Was disappointed in color. Supposed to be black but looks more like brown. Fit well, nonetheless, and so I sent them back and ordered a different style (Scribble) in grey. Received them yesterday and these are a keeper."
4,"Very Comfy Vegan Shoes, a Little Hard to Pick Size","I read many reviews about Sanuks shoes before buying them. I was trying to figure out whether to buy a 7 or an 8 because I am usually a 7 1/2 wide. It seemed that some people said they ran big and others said they ran small. I ended up going with the 8 and I found that they run big. As other reviewers have said they do stretch a bit as you wear them so width was not an issue, but they are very long. The toes bend up when I walk. On the bright side, they are still very comfortable both with socks and without. I plan on buying another pair in a different design in size 7 to see how that works out. I'll update my review when I do. On a sidenote I also have a pair of Sanuk flip-flops and they are extremely comfortable. One reviewer said the shoes were uglier than she had expected. I found they looked pretty much the same as the picture."
4,really comfy sandals!,"these sandals are really comfy and make for good slip-ons. At first the rubberised bits at the side actually rubbed at my foot quite a bit but since then they have broken in nicely. if you intend to wear it with socks you might want to order 1/2 a size up but other than that, they're great!"
3,Shoes,"Have not recieved this order as of yet. Purchased wrong size orginally, returned and ordered a size bigger, could you please infrom me of any complications, thanks."
1,Yes it's comfortable,"These shoes are extremely comfortable but they were uglier after I received my package than they had looked online. Everyone of my friends and family that saw it didn't like the look, they were even more appalled how much I had paid for them. I returned the product, there was a 10% ""restocking fee."" With the price of these, I would shell out my money for something prettier."
5,worthy purchase you won't regret,"i just bought some after work yesterday and was tired of wearing my converse the whole day. i'm an 8 1/2 and since they don't do half sizes i tried on the 9's and they were a perfect fit, so i'd say it's true to size. every shoe is handmade, so keep that in mind. i've noticed a considerable amount of comfort walking in these shoes than any other pair of shoes i've owned; they form to your feet and don't restrict movement. i've had a pair of rainbow sandals for 4 years now and i thought i loved those, but just after a night of wearing these, i think i love my sanuks more."
5,Comfortable sandals,"These are my second pair of Sanuks. They are lightweight and perfectly cushioned. I have the ""fiesta"" pattern and I love it! I receive so many compliments on them."
5,Love these shoes,I love all of my Sanuks but these match just about anything I could wear. I had ordered a size 8 which was too small so I had to send them back for a 9. I have to wear them with socks because 9 is a tad bit too big. I wish they made half sizes but with winter approaching socks are just fine.
4,Good for someone who doesn't like wearing shoes,"I found out about sanuks when I searched for ""shoes that don't feel like you're wearing shoes."" I fell into a river with these on. They wash and dry easily. You can wear them with socks or without. They are not good for the winter, obviously, but they are exactly what i wanted."
5,sooooo comfortable!,"i suggest buying a half size smaller than your regular shoe size due to the fact they are slippers. they have to be by far the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn. i have purchased another pair since these guys :D the company they ship from is efficient, and the shoes are definitely worth the buy!"
4,Nice style,I never would have thought this shoes look cute. They are very comfortable and sport looking very easy to match with t-shirts and jeans or shorts. The price was really good.
3,SMALL!,This is very cute but a lot smaller than it looks. I am glad I bought it on sale. Its overpriced (not on sale) in my opinion. I got several of them for about $11 each. Would not be a good shower gift where you pass around the gifts - looks pretty small and cheap. I am reserving them for gifts for acquaintances from work etc. I am satisfied for the price that I paid but dont be fooled by the picture - check out the dimensions.
1,Very disappointed,Very disappointed and mislead by the size of product. Much smaller than I anticipated!
2,Brain Dead,"I took the author's course at McGill University in the fall of 1994, and while Professor Donderi is a worthy scholar and lecturer, his textbook -- I regret to say -- is not up to par.Yes, the information is accurate, wide-ranging, and reasonably up-to-date; it covers much, from personality theory to statistics, and neuroanatomy. But it is written blandly, with little joy for its fascinating subject. Clarity is wanting, too, since the entry-level psychology student craves, at times, a less technical explanation of the complex subject matter. The illustrations are equally lifeless and at times simplistic, when they need to be bold, evocative, and conducive to memory, as the anatomy of the brain structures are covered here, too..."
5,Sickest CD EVER,"If you love underground/OldSkool Music, this is a must for anyones collection. i used to own thin in 1995 and lost it, thank god someone still sells it. this cd is off the hook. if you aint got it, go out and get it. wont be disappointed!"
4,Challenging Eye-Opener,"Howard French tells a story (actually a collection of stories) that evokes a variety of emotions -- sadness, fear, horror and sometimes laughter. By powerfully intertwining his personal experiences with the recent political history of Africa, he effectively weaves a rich tapestry of people we have long overlooked, underestimated and exploited in western society.I read this book hoping to gain a better context of the people and the continent before I visit Malawi later this year. The author delivered an unforgetable message and a challenge to look beyond what the US and European media have presented about Africa the last 20 years."
2,Tone of the book leaves a lot to be desired,"I'm in the middle of the book and I'm not liking it. Part of the problem is that I cannot stand the author. Something about the writing gives me the impression he has a huge ego. Apparently he's the only westerner who understands Africa's suffering. We're all too racist and far removed to see Africans as human beings. Apart from that, I don't like his portrayals of various figureheads. Is it really relevant to the story that Leopold III slept with 10 year old prostitutes? Do I care that Mobutu slept with his wife's twin sister? I understands these people are bad guys, but these asides are uncalled for.I was hoping to read something that wasn't so infused with the author's personal opinions. The book is interesting when he just sticks to historical facts."
5,"A amazing, enlightining read!","What a book! although i have never visited Africa i have always been interested in the continent , when i picked this book up i couldn't put it down!. It did more than that, instead of just telling a story explanations were given for it's problems by the author who obviously knows africa extremely well and loves the country while at the same time not being too sentimental about it. I have read many books about africa and i can honestly say this is the best one ive ever read! It is extremely critical of the west for good reason and should be a must read for anyone who wants to find out more about this beautiful continent."
1,NOTHING NEW!,Typical of the travelogue accounts of foreign journalists whose negative perception of everything Africa and Africans are honed in their home countries.But Africa keeps soldiering on defying the prognostications of interlopers.
2,bitter discontinuities,"despite early promise, marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self-reflection, this effort fails to deliver on the author's experience and acumen. the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread, apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of United States rhetoric and policies on Africa. i had hoped for more, given the fine record in newsprint of this well-traveled journalist."
2,Where's the history?,"Big disappointment. Published so soon after Hartley?s ?Zanzibar Chest? it seems a rushed, ?me too? narrative.French, despite his genetic link to the continent writes with the empathy for Africa expected of a US journalist dispatched for a few years two to the Dark Continent. Hartley, a white Kenyan, on the other hand simply ?gets-it?.I had hoped for much more detail of West Africa?s pre-colonial history and culture, but it failed on that level also."
3,Incorrect information,Book says John Levitow won the Medal of Honor on November 8 2000 when that was the day he died. He received the Medal of Honor on May 14 1970. Book is alright. Reads like an almanac.
4,A good sword but shouldn't be called a replica.,"I love Blood: the Last Vampire and Blood +. This sword is supposed to be the sword Saya used through the first half of the series. As a wall hanger it looks good, despite the wrap on the sheath being glued to itself instead of being tied. The blade, however is supposed to have gauges for Saya's blood to travel, since the only way to kill her enemies is to have her blood mix with theirs. This sword doesn't have the blood groves, which I was disappointed about since I think the concept is interesting and that fact is so important to the series. Also, the sword isn't full-tang so it's heavy on the one side but it's well made and I still really like it."
5,Do Adam and Eve have belly buttons?,"This is an excellent, straight forward answer book for those difficult questions teens and adults pose when trying to ""challenge"" catholic beliefs. It would be a great book for churches to make available to their Youth Groups."
1,Circular Logic is Circular,"The logic in many of these arguments was nonexistant, and the few good/inspiring answers were overshadowed by ones that were downright disturbing (e.g. it's better for someone to be in an abusive relationship then to remove themselves from a dangerous marriage)."
3,Too many of the same,"I really like Moon Mullican, but there are too many of the same songs on these albums. I'll have to pass on this one."
4,Great Music Before America Knows About It..`,"I discovered this series from Sony while in Europe last year. Imagine to my suprise to hear ""new music"" here that was on these compilations 1, 2 or more years ago. While there are multiple volumes, I have yet to find one which did not have at least half dozen songs that became classics, like When Will Love Come Home, Turn the Tide and others."
3,Feature disappearing,"Sony used to be unique, now they seem to be following the crowd. the lastest VCR, when taping,the channel is not showing on there SLV-779HF, I also have their SLV 778HF,which left that feature on. Seems each model they are taking out features,"
5,Great tire,Great tire for the price. Quiet running and 100 psi capable for low rolling resistance. Fits my Schwinn rim perfectly.
1,I loved it until a mere flat tire destroyed part of the sidewall.,"I was riding alongside Route 40 on my way to meet my wife for an event in a town a mere 12 miles away from my house, when the back tire went flat. I pulled right over and took of the tire to replace the inner tube, but I noticed that a portion of the sidewall was ragged. If I had been in the middle of nowhere, I would probably have tried getting it ready to go on, but instead I called my wife and she picked me up with still enough time to get to the event.I hung onto the original piece of crap that this bike tire is to be sure to warn people away from the strong possibility that the crappy quality is not unique to my bike."
1,Side wall blow in less than 500 miles,Brought a set and installed in at end of September. Pumped them to rated pressure (100 psi). The rear tire side wall blow after ~500 miles. There was no sign of problems before that. Now I have no confidence for the front tire.
1,Waste of Money,"I have the 26x1.25 high pressure tire. The side wall of this tire stretched and warped after less than a month of moderate to light use. After not riding my bike for a few days, I checked the tire pressure as usual (just under 100 psi) and when I rode the bike I thought I had a flat. It was worse, part of the sidewall developed a big bump which warped the tire making it unusable. I'm getting Michelins as replacements. Very, very disappointed. They're cheap but I didn't expect them to last just less than a month."
5,Tire for commuting,replace mountain bike tires with these they are heavy for a small tire put about 700 miles no flats i have good luck i recommend for anyone who wants a cheap tire
1,This tire ad is not complete!,"Ordered this tire expecting it to fit on the 20"" front rim of my TourEasy and when I tried to install it found the internal diameter was way too big. And that is because a standard tire is labeled 406 and this tire is a 451...don't know what that fits. No where in the as is it stated that the tire I ordered was a 451. I have contacted the seller about this and am waiting a reply. Be very careful when ordering from this seller until you know exactly what your getting!As of 9/12/12 I have received a full rebate for my purchase from Kenda Kwest and am satisfied with their customer service. This tire was purchased via Amazon."
4,movir,decent french movie. worth the rental. funny not too serious sometimes a little too brooding however. overall im happy i saw it
2,Disappointed,"I purchased for my grand daughter who loves 'Dora' thinking it was software she could use on a basic computer. I was really disappointed to see when it arrived I had to purchase the ""InteracTV"" system from Fisher Price (sold seperately) for around $[..]+. I agree with one reply in that there should of been something to say 'this item REQUIRES an additional system to use the DVD'. Anyway, as for the seller, do have to give kudos for prompt shippment as received within few days in perfect condition. Can't use but am donating so someone will enjoy this DVD for Christmas."
5,WOW! What a nice surprise!,"Car Crash and The Ocean Always Wins should definitely be on the radio. The other songs are way above average, as well.Josh and Paz - if you read this, you should DEFINITELY keep this up - you're seriously on to something.I couldn't be happier with this, but it's more poppy and different from the Josh Rouse CDs, but if you're a JR fan, I don't see you being disappointed!"
1,josh and his yoko,What happened to the Josh Rouse I've loved up untiland including the Nashville cd? Girl comes and songs suffer.
3,Cannot travel with it,"Airlines do not allow you to carry this along with your hand baggage. So if you travel a lot, its better you avoid this."
4,A Clergyman's Daughter,"This book is absolutely marvelous. Orwell paints a very captivating picture of the difference between the classes in England, as well as the varying degrees of religiousness among the classes. The observations that Orwell makes are insightful and very expressive. I honestly prefer this book over 1984."
4,A Clergyman's Daughter - Kindle edition,Excellent book. A good example of Orwell's ability to spin a good yarn. The title is mundane but the content covers many aspects of human experience and condition. The the lookup dictionary function on Kindle was very useful for this book.
4,DRAMATIC INTERESTING DIFFERENT,CLERCYMANS DAUGHTER - IT CAPTURED ME IN AN AMAZING SENSE......A BOOK TO BUY AND ENJOY. yOU WILL BE CAPTURED IN THE STORY OF THE STRIVES OF LITTLE DOROTHY........EXCELLENT.
2,worthy dream,"i read this more as an essay and commentary regarding prewar england. themes of church intollerance, school rigidity, classism, bigotry, etc. abound. one can read this literally, leaving the task confused and befuddled. one should read this metaphorically, perhaps as a dream sequence, to fairly appreciate what orwell sought to accomplish. i enjoyed elements of this for the sheer brilliance of observation. life at the hops camp was particularlly sharp. if one appreciates gritty labor struggles and observations of the religiously constrained, this will be a pile of words worth reading."
4,"Good book, full of ideas for playtime.","Good book, full of ideas for playtime and skill development. Good book, full of ideas for playtime and skill development."
4,Ring the bell,This story of the Basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL (BUD/S) is a good read. It takes the readers through the course by someone who was there back when there used to be East and West coast schools. The only problem i did have with it is that you did miss some of the action as this was told by someone who went through it many years ago. Time and pain seem to erase quite a bit. Add it to your SEAL collection.Hooyah!
5,A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys,"I've been a fan of BSB since 1986, and I've always enjoyed their music. If you are an older fan like I am, you'll enjoy this DVD of the group at a younger age and a more intimate concert. There's no choreographed dancing and their vocal abilities are highlighted by solo performances of each ""Boy"". This is one to add to your collection of BSB DVDs, if you do not have it already."
4,A Nice Gift...,"If your friend or yourself is a die-hard BSB fan this is a great gift! BSB do an unplugged show of all of their earlier hits and each do a solo number, including Nicks ""I Need You Tonight"" off of the Millenium album. Interviews with some of the boys take you behind the scenes of how this special show came about and what went into it! Watch as the guys sway you into their slick songs and romantic harmonies and have yourself a night in the Backstreets night out!"
4,TALENT & LOOKS--ALL ROLLED INTO ONE GROUP!,"I'm not ashamed to say it: I'm in my thirties and I LOVE THE BACKSTREET BOYS' music! Thisvideo exposes the talent that their non-fans sometimes feel they just don't possess because they're such good looking guys. But these five young guys prove you CAN have looks, brains and talent, not to mention be gracious to fans and respectful of lyrics and not sending wrong messages in their songs. They have a great sound, very easy to listen to, and this Night Out video will convince you to head to your music shop and pick up all their stuff, even the imports that are hard to find (BUT AMAZON HAS 'EM! )"
4,A Night Out With The Backstreet Boys,Well I have the VHS edition and I say this concert is great.The only thing is I'm more of a funk man and I prefer HomecomingLive in Orlando.
4,"Amazed,awesome, but no dancing, sorry","I was amazed by this video, I love the backstreet boys and I wanted something that I could listen and watch them sing. The only disappointment was that I wish someone would have mentioned that there is no dancing whatsoever in this video, which is only 1/4 of why I wanted to buy it. There are two video clips on the end of the tape that are just awesome and I can't wait until someone discovers that not only would it help to sell cds, audio tapes, but music videos as well, just so see the guys sing, when we can't go to all those concerts of theirs. I really love listening to their music and watching them sing on this video."
2,BORING,they were not dancing in any part of the movie which was really boring but the two videos at the end were a nice touch.
5,It's the best,"I love this set.The video was great,i really love it.But the cd was the best in the set."
5,The best backstreet home video ever!!,"This video shows the boys in a smooth candelit setting out in Germany with German fans as audience (too lucky, aren't they?) which was made on March,30 1998. It includes some brand new songs like ""Who do you love?"" and Kevin's Solo. Every backstreet fan HAS to have this video in her house; plus it has the vids for ""All i have to give"" and the U.S. version for ""I'll never break your heart"". Too gorgeous to see it just once!!"
5,A Night Out....All I Really Need To Say is...GET IT!!,"This is a really cool video!! It has many of their old songs, plus their new songs!! Most of the songs in the video are their ballads, but not all!! The new songs are their solos for the next album i believe. Also, some of their old songs have been revamped!! It is totally amazing!! It is a must have!!"
5,The Boys are Awesome!,I'm the hugest fan of BSB and this was a really groovy video to watch. It makes you wanna turn the lights down and cuddle up with a pillow. These boys will make your heart melt. I could never say anything bad about BSB. What can I say? They take care of their fans well!! :o)
1,"Not good, even for light reading.","I'm embarrassed that I even read this book through to the end. The dialogue was wooden, the plot was was like something from a Harlequin romance from the `80s, (Yes, I know whereof I speak; my older sister used to bring them home all the time back then) and it was smattered with sex scenes that were anything but sexy. I might have overlooked all that if I had liked even one character, but somehow the author didn't create a single well-developed character in 550 pages plus. Alas, the potential I saw in the back-cover blurb kept me reading, hoping it would get better, but all I got was badly written chick lit, and poor editing to boot."
4,The story of an L.A.-based R&B label that went nowhere.,"Renfro Records was an L.A.-based label whose records went nowhere during its 1960s-early'70s heyday but whose music merits a reappraisal. The rarities from Carl Henderson, The Attractions, Helen Moore and Viola Edwards are ""lost"" soul trasures that you'll love while the other tracks provide a glimpse into the classy and sophisticated Los Angeles R&B scene of the day. Very extensive liner notes round out the package very nicely and make this package a fine tribute to Tony Renfro's label. I failed to give this CD a 5-star rating because of some tracks' relatively poor sound quality but this is still a fine compilation and I highly recommend it."
3,"Not a bad concert, don't expect the whole Marley family though...","I enjoyed Steven and Damien a lot, it was really nice to see them interacting on stage together. Too bad that they were the only Marley's performing, the concert would have been much better if there had been more family participation. Capleton was excellent as always. A big problem with the concert was that there was not enough miking to get the audience's reactions to the songs or sing-alongs on the recorded audio. Not bad overall but could have been better."
4,The basics of Winemaking,This book will explain wine making. This book is goes deeply into the wine making of fruit but their is a little for everyone. The book has a variety of recipes and explains all the processes necessary to have good tasting wine.
4,"Very good ""how to"" for wine only (not growing grapes)","This book is an in-depth look at the techniques for making wine with no information on growing grapes. If that suites you, then I highly recommend it. In addition to the basics, it goes into some of the more advanced techniques like carbonic maceration, etc. And as such, it offers a great breadth of knowledge. In fact, I only had one real problem with this book: the author is a bit verbose. I found myself falling asleep with paragraph after paragraph of information when a bullet point would have done nicely. That said, it isn't too bad getting too much information."
2,wading trough thick mud,"The writer seems to be of the opinion that anyone can make wine, even the severely intelectually challenged. This may be a very broadminded idea, but for the average reader this means that even the smallest step is elaborated. Just to give you an idea: if you add yeast, you first have to dissolve this in tepid water, then add to the must, mix after some hours. But this takes 2 pages to explain. First we learn how to obtain water of a certain temperature, either by mixing hot and cold, or by heating cold water in te microwave (and for the really retarded: don't forget to take out the thermometer!). Then we are told what ""a couple of hours"" means: if you add the yeast in the evening, mix next morning, but if you added the yeast in the morning, wait till afternoon!But if you are really slow-witted, this book may be just ther thing for you!"
3,Not for the beginner,"According to this book, you'll need lots of specialized equipment and $$ to make your own wine. Disappointing."
4,Quality Faceplate,Despite some people's apparent ignorance of what a review is supposed to based on this is actually a pretty good faceplate. Its made out of sturdy plastic and overall it seems very nice. The reason I purchased it was because I needed a red power button to place it into a black faceplate to make it stand out more. all in all I'm very happy with it.
4,Wonderful addition to holiday collection,I had received a cassette version of this cd a few years ago. Absolutely fell in love with it then . . . so happy I was able to find the cd version this year!
3,An essential for the hardcore fan,"For the hardcore Twins fan, this is a must-have. The material is familiar, and the mixes and vocals interesting, if not overwhelmingly new. But for new fans who would like an introduction to the Twins, I would recommend Victorialand or Blue Bell Knoll."
2,"I love them, but live Cocteau Twins isn't optimal","I'm as big a fan as they come, but live Cocteau has a problem -- there's just one Elizabeth. On studio albums, as you know, there are numerous vocal tracks, creating a rich, layered sound. I never knew how important this element was until it was gone. Live recordings (including the BBC Sessions) just feel sort of anemic, because only one melody is being sung. Yes, her voice is still beautiful, but it changes the nature of the songs.I'm not going to tell anyone not to listen for themselves, but I was disappointed."
4,cocteau's delight,"this very nice set overcame my good-but-not-great impression of CT. another reviewer called their performances here ""coarse"" and that's exactly right: in a few places you can almost hear the jesus and mary chain grinding away under the sweet and melancholy whisps. that's a good thing (i think), and overall this stands up well beside victorialand."
4,Pleasant quiet movie,"A pleasure to watch.The main character, a nine year old child appears in every single scene as he discovers sexuality in the adult members of his familiy. The VDV does not contain any features and the subtitles cannot be turned off."
3,Secrets of the Heart,"This is an elegant and poignant tale of the mysterious and magical adult world as seen through the eyes of Javi, a nine year old child, growing up in a small provincial town in the 1960's.Javi believes he can hear the voices of the dead and that they whisper to him their secrets, which were left unspoken in life. At his mother's house in the mountains, he is fascinated by the room in which his father died and which his mother carefully keeps locked. But, Javi learns that the living have their secrets as well.As Javi begins to comprehend these secrets of the heart, he takes us on a journey where we are offered ""The irresistible opportunity to see the world once again through the innocent eyes of a child.""There is no nudity in this movie."
5,"Iceboating 101 through advanced racing, short course","I've sailed on ice for years in CO, mostly with my old DN and bought this book on a whim.If you are even curious about iceboats, this is a modest investment and a fabulous piece of work. The author writes a good story about how infectious this sport is but also did a LOT of work researching the history of iceboating and decribing the evolution of comtemporary iceboats.She also has a lot of technical information involving racing right-of-way and rules that I am not interested in because my boat is a beat up old cruiser but it's a great reference piece. Entertaining reading at the very least.If you ever see sails on ice, drive down there and talk to the sailors. They're generally friendly people who might well let you take their boat out providing you understand that it is actually a very fast and potentially dangerous activity. Depending on the wind of course. She'll explain that to you in this book."
5,Great Speakers!!,"I've had a set of Vegas since 1998, so it was a no brainer to get a pair for my girlfriend. Both she and I were very impressed with their quality and awesome sound. It made the sex that night unforgettable!!"
2,Too much of a bad thing,"I adore Elizabeth Lowell, and was excited when I got my hands on this book, her first Silhouette romance. Her themes of trust and distrust, betrayal and redemption are clearly being developed in this one. However, the hero was so much of a jerk and the heroine was so much of a doormat that I mainly wanted to fling this book against the wall and stomp on it a few times for good measure. It was a tremendous disappointment, and I'm not surprised that it is not of of EL's older Silhouettes that are being rewritten."
1,From Back Cover,"LOGAN GARRETT DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LOVEHe belived in revenge. Dawn Sheridan's beautiful, calculating mother had destroyed Logan's older brother, and Logan had sworn vengeance. When he won the Sheridan ranch in a poker games he should have been satisfied - but he wasn't. Dawn, who resembled her beautiful mother so closely, was the perfect target for his anger. Yet Logan found that in hurting her, he came away wounded.Dawn understood what Logan was afraid to admit - that what he wanted from her was love, not hatred. She gave him that love, risking everything to reach the gentle, caring man beneath his pain, knowing that if she lost, Logan would finally have the vengeance he sought."
1,Horrible - don't waste your money,"I looked forward to watching these concerts, after watching many of the 60's groups on great PBS concerts. BIG disappointment. Gary Puckett and Gary Lewis didn't sound anything like they did years ago =no resemblence at all. It could have been strangers trying to sing their songs. The Association was so-so. Their voices were weak and the harmony sometimes clashed. This concert series is totally depressing, and the DVD set is trash as far as I'm concerned. I can see now why these former hit singers were not on any of the PBS 60's reunion concerts!"
2,Gary Puckett and the Union Gap,The only dvd I had a problem with was Gary Puckett and the Union Gap. I have always liked the way Gary sounded back in the seventies. I know that the voice goes after many years but the way Gary sounds on this dvd is a joke! The voice is totally gone and then he tries to make up for it. Does not sound at all like him! I do not recommend this DVD. He should never have recorded this and rather left us with the pleasant memories of years gone by.
2,Not what they should be.,"Sadly, the performances caught here aren't always what they should be. This is a much later version of The Association and the sound isn't quite right and some of the songs are shaky. The other shows aren't consistantly strong and there's this annoyingly fake ""applause swell"" that becomes painfully apparent when they show the audience sitting still during the fake applause. A more intimate setting would have helped, but this could have been done much better. Recommended only for those who are ardent fans of these artists and want everything in their archive."
3,an instructor and scientist from South Dakota,"Although Einstein's basic life history and his theoretical concepts are reviewed moderately well for a child of about twelve, we found the book difficult to read due to the short and very choppy sentence structure. This writing style was very distracting to us as we tried to read this aloud to our children. Parent added dynamics and humor helped retain interest. Photos were only moderately relavent and the illustrations were actually mediocre quality black and white sketches."
3,A laminated map of Arizona,"I bought this because I am planning a long weekend in Sedona, after flying into Phoenix and picking up a rental car. It's no better than a map I would expect to get for free from the car rental agency, but it's laminated. Really I bought this because I had already place 3 Sedona books in my Shopping Cart and needed a fourth item to qualify for the 4-for-3 special from Amazon, so essentially this map was free. For that price, I guess it's worth the money."
3,middling poncho book,"About 20 ponchos. Two are for little kids. Mostly bulky type yarns on big needles. Good ones are: mitered poncho, entrelac poncho (definitely want to make this one), cabled turtleneck poncho, lace-cable poncho, cable and lattice poncho. Bad idea is the cape with the zipper. Unzip it and zing: it falls to the ground. Mohair poncho (or capelet) has pockets for some strange reason as it's much too short for them. The book might be useful as a stash buster to double up my regular yarns on the ponchos. So not the best of my poncho books but also not the worst. For that one see the Stork book."
2,Nothing stands out really.,I doubt I will make any of the designs in this book. I just don't care for them. The book is very tiny.
3,better books out there,This was an ok read but there are definately better books to be had if you want to read up on the churches of Revelation...... SUPPORT ISRAEL.................
3,Great book- but NO pictures!,"This is a very interesting book with historical stories relating to the ghost towns.However, I was VERY disappointed after learning that there wasn't even ONE actual picture in the book of the old ghost towns- just drawings!I will probably sell this book and seek one out that has old historical photographs as well.Personally- I think it is fascinating to see the actual pictures of the ghost towns, too."
5,"Outstanding, intimate acoustic performance","Having a chance to see Josh perform an acoustic set is one of life's great pleasures. This EP gives one an opportunity to hear Josh performing six songs in a fantastic Idaho indie store. It's immediate and powerful (no silly overdubs), and Josh's warmth and humor shine. One can see why Josh has developed a rabid following!This EP is a great addition to your collection. It's even a powerful introduction! Buy this now! It's even a deal - 6 songs, for 6 bucks!"
5,awesome music,"Josh Ritter is an incredible musician and hearing him play live is a thrill. If you haven't listened to him, you need to. You are missing out."
3,The Colonel,"Because this song writer is originally from Idaho, the place I call home, I've got to give him his due. However, the songs on this CD are a bit too sentimental for my taste. Write what you actually know about would be my advise to this young tallent."
5,An extraordinary book from an extraordinary artist,"This book is fantastic as far as photo books go. There is a important quality attached to having good reproductions in a printed book. The Bone House has some of the best reproductions of the original prints availiable, aside from appropriate information about the author and artist himself."
3,I was not impressed with the sound.,I own every album the Maddox Bros and Rose ever cut.This particular album does not have the sound quality that I expected. No matter what Rose can still touch your heart.
5,Very Relaxing,This music cd is awesome. It lets you relax and let the stress melt away. I love all the nature sounds it's as if I was right there next to that stream or bird...........AWESOME. Great product.
2,Hope you like dripping water,"This CD is mostly water sounds with music in the background. They should mark the CD as a ""sound effects"" CD and not a ""music"" CD. It gets the 2 stars because the actual music is well done, otherwise it would be 1."
5,FBAGILTER,"FITS GREAT, WORKS GREAT ........................... . ..... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ... .... ."
1,arrived on time,Not very good description of size online. Did not come close to fitting my shop vac. Looked like a good solution to clogged filter.
5,"Yup, works with the micro","Like the other fella said, this filter works with the shop vac micro. The other reusable filters don't seem to, so don't bother unless you want to tailor them to fit.I bought this because I hate dealing with vacuum bags. This allows the micro to go bagless.It might be a TOUCH loose on the micro. I may wind up slimming it a bit. But that's really splitting hairs. It works good."
4,Good movie but missing one important thing,This New DVD has no Chapter list in the menu? Why would someone not include this in the menu? The only options are Play and Trailer.
5,Nostalgic and Noteworthy!,"This movie is the inspiring story of George Gershwin and his music. I adore this movie and I watch it often. To avoid searching for it in the listings, I'm purchasing my own copy. Parents --- introduce your children to George Gershwin's music with a wholesome, entertaining movie! ""Rhapsody in Blue"" is family entertainment at its best. A tender blend of biography and incredible music, this film honors one of one of America's most beloved composers!"
3,Great music Dull lifestyle,"For some guy who wrote such brilliant music, I am disappointed at his mundane lifestyle. Or was the scriptwriter(s) accurate and ignored escapism for realism >"
2,Valuable only as a document,"A truly Hollywood-ized take on the life of George Gershwin with laughable cliches and untruths.The only merit is found with appearances by the folks who were actually there: Paul Whiteman, Oscar Levant, Al Jolson and a glimpse of Gershwin's first attempt at opera- Blue Monday."
3,First the bad news,"This is one of those films that seems WAY longer than it actually is, and it's not exactly short to begin with. Second, I can think of better leads than Alda. But he was actually better than I'd thought he'd be. What makes this film a little gem is seeing people like Hazel Scott act and perform, as well as all the great music and historical perspective the film offers. Hopefully, we'll be seeing it on DVD soon."
4,a classic,"I was nine years old when this masterpiece first appeared on our neighborhood screen. I may have missed it cause you know young boys interests were cowboys and indians, and Saturday serials. My parents probably did see it, but it was never mentioned over the dinner table. Now, 56 years later, I have found this classic, and have it my own tape. This is music noone will ever see or hear again. As we grow out of our chilhood years into young adult, we start to appreciate these kind of stories. And, I mus say, made only better in black and white, a standard of that time. Maybe this classic wouldn't have went over in color, maybe it would. But, I will now enjoy this classic all I want. As an aside, when I was that young tot, I had thought that George and Ira were married! Goes to show how much I paid attention. Dumb, heh? Woody Allens' movie ""Manhattan"" has many of these songs in it's sound track. See it too....."
4,Great for the historical bits,"The real value is the numerous recordings by the actual people: Oscar Levant, Paul Whiteman, Anne Brown, and others.I read a review that said that the movie is not true to history, which is unfortunate, since telling the actual history would be far more interesting at this point than telling a good story. But I bought it for the historical recordings and was not disappointed."
4,Excellent even if somewhat dated.,"I found this treatise to be an excellent source of background information so long as I kept first in mind that nobody, and no single book is absolutely correct or totally unbiased or slips into simplicity when discussing complex issues.We at LJ's Breaking Free$ make every effort to avoid the one-liner and will do well to at least try to provide several alternative viewpoints just as has this book. Buy this book, read it, then visit or, if you already are in the Middle East or North Africa, look for truth not beneath the scars to learn what it is to be Arabian or Egyptian or, I'm treading lightly here, Maghrebian - Bill Anderson (LJ)."
1,awfully written,"The text for this small book is so atrociously written and subtly racist that I'm tempted to throw it away. Ian Jeffrey's commentary ranges from inane: ""The glove signifies [a] hand""; to racist--the only word Jeffrey knows to characterize Japanese faces seems to be ""diffident"", counted at least 3 times; to just plain wrong: in ""Handicapped Soldiers"" Jeffrey notes two figures aware of the photographer's presence when clearly THREE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE CAMERA! So much for helping improve public visual literacy. This is a brilliant opportunity to provide concise, critical commentary on Tomatsu's work squandered."
3,A little too extra sensory for me,"Easy reading & keeps your attention, but not as good as his 1st book, Broken Hearts. This one is a little too extra sensory based for me. Having lived in Memphis & Charlottesville, I enjoyed all the local references."
5,Levy has done it again.,"Bob Levy has done it again in spades. `Past Tense' is a thrilling follow-up to his first novel `Broken Hearts' featuring the same kindly old ex-policeman Joey O'Riley. This time O'Riley is swept fifty years into the past to solve the unsolvable and keep evil from entering the White House. The trail Levy weaves makes an intensely intriguing read so do yourself a favor - don't nibble on this one unless you have time to eat it in one meal. Rus Morgan, Host Interviewer of PBS ""Book Talk"". (Mr. Morgan has read the book and interviewed ninety eight authors in the series since its inception in 1993."
3,"Great photos, good quality, too small","I can't give it the 5 stars it deserves. The quality of the photo reproductions in this book are excellent, but they're so small you can't appreciate the images. The book is the size of a paper-back novel. In my opinion, photogravure books need to be bigger (i.e. coffee-table book size) to be able to enjoy the artwork. Text was interesting but far from a complete biography. I was left wanting more info. The publisher used thick, semi-gloss paper, and full-spectrum, high-def printing. Then the photos were made teeny-weeny. Why? 5 stars for the artwork and the quality of reproduction, though."
3,"Good read, but poor project selection","Think of this as a textbook on woodworking. It's an interesting, elementary read, sure to provide some good information to those new to the world of woodworking. However, like a textbook, it seems best suited to the classroom/lab environment, particularly the projects. A beginning woodworker is unlikely to have a lot of the tools required for various steps of the project unless they have access to a shop at a local school or community college. However, with a bit of thought, you could probably modify these projects to match your resources."
4,Very Helpful book,"I found this to be the best wood workin book that I have come accross. The book would be a good choice for those who have not done a lot of woodworking but would like to get more serious, as well as for those of us who have been away from it for many years. In the world of a power tool for everything under the sun and instant quality Korn's book does a masterful job of explaining when and how to use the proper tool for the correct job. As a mid-level hobbyist, this book was perfect for my need, explaining how to use both power and hand tools, when to use them and why. The safety tips were excellent as well. I especially like the project progression as a method to teach and learn the basic techniques of working with wood. The book reignited a desire for high quality work with a personal touch."
2,modern woodworking for rich people,"With this book you need a lot of expensive machines.I don't consider this basic...............A book of pictures.Hope you can find better,finally all is here is on the web too, but free .LM"
3,More of a project book,"This book is basically a collection of projects, and then explanations of the various techniques used for each step. Good if you want to make an end table, but not that useful overall. A better book to learn all the different woodworking techniques would be The Complete Manual of Woodworking by Albert Jackson, et. al., which contains everything this does (explained and illustrated much better), and much more."
5,A great book for beginner to experienced woodworkers,The author does a great job of walking through the basics of woodworking. If you read and follow the book I believe your woodworking skills will improve.
3,Fair product,"I've had this weather station for about a year now. I've found that the weather forecast is as accurate as the manufacture says. 75%. Setup is not too difficult. You do have to go on the Internet to find out what the current pressure is for your area, but that's not too difficult. The unit could be a little smaller for its screen. I think its a little wasted space. I also have a problem with the radio clock. Even when I turn the feature off, it still sets the time. This wouldn't be too bad except that it sets it for the wrong time zone. I have the instruction book and there is nothing about setting the time zone. The moon clock is also accurate. I've also found this item cheaper than Amazon on other web sites for $59.95."
5,Busy Active Woman,The book comes with very good practical and insightful advice and tips for the busy woman. It incorporates the practical with the spiritural realm which helps to put things into proper perspective. I highly recommend this book for the woman who does too much.
2,Humm,"I found the Holy Piby interesting and very different from anything I had ever read. I have a little more insight on the concept, however,I will continue to study the bible. The 2 star rating I gave is only my opinion and is based off me reading about half way through the book."
3,"Good for giggles, but...",very difficult to use as a bird deterrent because it cannot get wet. I don't really have any place outside to hang it where it won't get rained on. But it is really funny to use inside....
2,Eats Batteries,"It did actually work, but it eats batteries and is difficult to mount up high and be able to access the battery compartment. I had to rig a pulley system to get it down so I could change the battery. Also, I made a plastic cover to protect it from the weather. But, it did work."
1,Garbage,"Waited months for this, and when it arrived it didn't work. Manufacturer would not refund my money, saying I'd had the item too long. (She counted the time from the initial order.) Mark me down as real unhappy."
1,INFERIOR & EXPENSIVE,"I purchased 4 of these and hung them directly to the eaves to ensure dryness. They do chase off woodpeckers, but they are a nuisance to remove and check the batteries & if you check the batteries too often by making a noise you run the risk of wearing out the mechanism. These things are made in China & after 1 unit failed the the marketeer informed me the life may be as short as 4 Months ! My first one failed because after it droped it went beyond the wind-up point and just stayed at the bottom and ran the battery out/ burned up the retract mechanism. The other failed due to the sound sensor failing. Save your money ! I installed sections of inexpensive bird netting. Netting will not need constant attention & the black color is nearly invisable unless you are standing directly in front of it. A Google search also reveals shaving mirrors work also."
4,A Good Civil War Story,"For those who enjoy reading about the Civil War this is an excellent story. It combines factual history with richly developed characters struggling to maintain their lives during a time of turmoil and upheaval. The life of General Morgan and his men is described as well as the lives of their families. The author has a keen sense of history which is evident in the acurately described , carefully researched details of the movement of General Morgan and his men. The plot twists and culminates in a wonderfully unexpected ending. This was a very readable and enjoyable book."
4,Interesting and Brilliantly Researched,"My purchase and interest in this book started when I had to do a research paper on Heinrich Himmler's psychobiographical background. There is an extremely well written chapter in this book which is based primarily off of the work of Angress and Smith who were the first to ever write on Himmler's teenage diaries. What you find about Heinrich Himmler, I will leave for you, the reader, to discover as it will definitely throw you for a loop that no fiction book could even do. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history beyond just dates, names and statistics. This is a great beginner's book for those who have always wondered what psychological factors played into history. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because Loewenberg made a few comments on sexuality that are broad and unfounded."
3,"FRED ZINNEMANN, OPUS 23",***1/2 Last film directed by Fred Zinnemann. Melancholic film about the passing of time with the Swiss Alps as backdrop. Sublime metaphorical scene showing a dead young man preserved by the ice of a glacier for 40 years and his 60 years old bride. Recommended.
5,Good Ebayer.,"Somewhat slow delivery, however this is not the sellers fault. The item was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition, so I am satisfied with the transaction."
2,You won't find a better video.... NO YOU WON'T!!,"Ok.... So, where is the bloody plot!!! Come on!! When most of the review on the back of the box is talking about Sean Connery's one minute self done stunt, you know you should probably be worried. It's good for a laugh, though!!!"
1,Don't get this book. Get the Illustrated Book of Pregnancy & Baby Care instead!,"I bought ""The Complete Book of Mother & Baby Care"" (hard cover) and the ""Illustrated Book of Pregnancy & Baby Care"" (soft cover). I paid $47 for the first (CBM&BC) and only $7 for an used issue of the second one (IBP&BC). Surprise, surprise! They are the same, exact book! The only difference is that IBP&BC consists of a more recent printing from a different publisher (Hearst Books). Pictures and images are sharper on the IBP&BC. Even though, CBM&BC cover states ""New Fully Updated Edition"", these books consist of a 1995 reprint while the IBP&BC latest reprint is from 2004. Hope this may help!"
3,Tails from the toolbox,"The book has a wonderful premiss. To hear about the behind the scenes of a professional cycling team mechanic. But unfortunately the book is a bit sporadic in the telling of the tales. There just doesn't seem to be much flow through out the book. That being said, I thought that several of the stories were wonderfully viseral. They really convey the more day to day trials and tribulations that a pro mechanic has to deal with. And even though they were sort of stuck into the end of the book I must say I thought his chapters on bike washing and tool selection were the best part. The book is definately intriguing enough to recommend to anyone who wants to know what its really like to be a pro mechanic."
1,Not an authority.,"Should all of us have time and resources to pretend that we are an authority on raising children, we could all write a book. The rest of us work and love our children as best as we can. If you've had one child and you are sensible, this book will do nothing but give you a chuckle or two. My copy is in the trash, with the last diaper. I hope the landfill is in Connecticut."
1,Husband wouldn't read it,I found this book somewhat funny and tried to interest my husbnd in it so he could understand a bit more what I was going through with my first pregnancy but I could never get him to read it.
1,Good For Kindling,"My sister gave me this book after the birth of my daughter. After reading a good portion of it, I started to wonder if this guy is a horse-toothed jacka$$ or the most effeminate male in America. Then I thought, wait a minute; he's probably both. What was the motivation for writing this book? To try and show everyone how perfect his life is or, to collect a shat load of money for doling out common-sense advice? After reading about him carrying his wife into the bedroom for the third time, I started to get annoyed. If you're the type of guy that eagerly waits for the new Volkswagen models to come in - then you'll love this book. Look, in all seriousness, you already know what to do; it's innate. Don't waste time with a silly book written by a guy with no credentials besides having kids."
5,Highly Recommended,"Let's face it, for most of us personal finances is not fun. Not only does it require working with figures that we'd rather not examine, but it also means taking a hard look at who we are and our relationship with money. This book understands these fears and gently helps the reader through all sorts of rough financial terrain. This book is written is a friendly, straight-forward style that doesn't overwhelm the reader. I found the author's supportive one-question-at-a-time approach to be very refreshing. The book's content is clearly divided in such a way that any reader can easily reference information that is applicable to her or his financial situation."
5,"Wonderful story, beautifuly told","All those of us, who spent their youth flying imaginary spitfires and hurricanes across school playing fields, arms out stretched; creating the howl of the Merlin engine will immediately love this feature. The genuine enthusiasm of the brothers, the interviews with the veteran pilots, such non assuming men, but genuine heroes to keep going up there despite overwhelming odds, the flying sequences and the recreation of the battle of Britain day attack make this a wonderful documentary to watch, learn and yes even resorting to blinking rapidly my eyes to hide one or two tears. A genuine tribute to the RAF pilots of an average age of 22 who sacrificed their lives that we may live in freedom. Brilliant."
3,Battle of Britain - Ewan McGregor,"This DVD is a documentary and I did not look at the written information closely enough. I thought it was a re-make of the Battle of Britain, which it was not. There is certainly nothing wrong with this DVD or the merchandise. However, it is of limited interest to me. I would however, recommend it to individuals interested in WW II Warbirds and the details and description of what the pilots faced in the Battle of Britain."
1,Aviation,"Boy did I get taken to the cleaners, I am a sucker for any thing aviation, I think they used one airplane in this lousy movie. Save your money."
1,skip it,Projection is unreadable & small. Bought it for my mother in law. Backlight isuseless at night as you have to push a button to see the display. Hard to find a simple clock without all the bells & whistles which would only confuse her. I thought this might be it but I was mistaken.
1,Projection broke within a week,"Half of the lights broke on the number projector.It's also bizarrely hard to arrange settings, and even the plug difficult to get in."
1,Projection arm,Projection arm only projects when snooze button is pressed. How can it be made to always be on?
2,Very Very Weak projection,This projection clock has very very weak projection abilities. The alarm is also very weak and soft. Don't buy this even if you are thinking of placing it in the bedroom as a fancy alarm clock. You will not be able to project the time to most of the walls in the bedroom and it can't wake you up.
2,"Good at projection and time keeping, but difficult to use","Overall, works well as a clock. Projects clearly onto ceiling. It is flimsy and a bit of a challenge to set up.Probably the biggest limitation is when used as an alarm clock. The alarm itself is nice, non-grating beeps. Much better then usual ""buzz"" sound.However, hold the button too long to silence and you end up changing the time. One frequently does this because the simple act of pressing the button is not enough to turn the alarm off. Then you end up having to reset the alarm time. Not so easy to do when you are just waking up. If they had a separate switch to turn the alarm off, then I'd probably rate this a 4-star product."
2,best used as a travel alarm clock,"The unit is too light to use as an everyday nightstand alarm clock. The weight of the AC adapter cord pulls it off the nightstand. The projected time is rather dim. It is made of cheap plastic and it's ugly. In short, this may be a decent travel alarm clock, but is not suitable for use as an everyday alarm clock."
1,Projection clock,The La Cross Priojection Clock that I recently baught through Amazon is too faint to be seen easily.
3,adequate but...,"This clock does the job but just barely.Projected numerals are relatively small and faint. Backlighting is timed out, not the end of the world but inconvenient.Limited function buttons make it difficult to operate.As a travel alarm clock it's laid out. But for every day use, it doesn't quite make the grade."
3,"Bad design, Bad service, Misleading promotion, High Cost","After the review listed below I stumbled on the correct settings and used the clock for several years. I can't remember how I did it but it did work.Bad design: the material of the clock is of the lowest quality. The functions are difficult to find, the display is unreadable in the dark and the projection only comes on if other settings are correct.Misleading promotion: There should be a way, according to the instruction manual that I checked before purchase, to keep the projector on all the time. The instructions are not clear, or perhaps wrong. The result is the same; I can't enable this feature.Bad service: my email to the company asking for help received a patronizing response three weeks later and the second has not been answered after three more weeks.At WalMart I can pick up a functional night time clock for $6. This one cost me $30, but would have cost me too much in time even if I had been paid to try it and then throw it away!"
1,think long about this purchase,"time displayed only 3 digits, very dim. then the light went out all together. address in booklet to handle this didn't work. we had it 2 weeks.La Crosse Technology Projection Alarm Clock with Humidity & Temperature"
4,It is what it says it is,"I didn't follow the instructions when I opened the package. So, I did it all wrong. Then I took out the batteries (probably didn't need to) and followed the instructions. In a few minutes the clock set itself to within a minute of the correct time. within 24 hours, it was correct to the second. The projector is well focused and easy to read at night."
3,"Pretty Good, and Cost-Effective",Does a good job and is a real bargain. Projected numbers can be rotated and made dimmer or brighter. Time and date is set automatically.
3,Improvement desired.,"I purchased this clock to replace one I had given to a friend who is a quadriplegic. When she awakens at night she likes to look on the wall to see the projected time. This clock's projection is too faint for her to see it well. However, the feature of the room temperature is quite useful."
3,good product,"I really liked the projection alarm clock. But, when I bought it I thought it did the outdoor temperature, but it only does the inside temperature."
4,Projection Alarm Clock,Arrived okay. Projects okay in dark room.Not good for projecting in lighted area or morning light.Clock set itself okay.
2,so wanted to love it - but it doesn't last,"I bought this product on a lark thinking it would be a toy but I loved it - I liked being able to see the time on the ceiling - after 9 months it became inconsistent. When I emailed the company about it, I never received a reply. I tried changing all the batteries and it worked so so. After a year it died - out of warranty. I wanted to love it but I do not consider it dependable and I don't find the company responsive to customer inquries about product function. I would NOT recommend this brand."
5,happy sleeper,"If you like to know the time during the dark of night, this baby is for you. The red color goes easy on the eyes...not enough to shock you into wakefullness."
3,Projection Clock only OK,"I bought this clock based on a 4 star review. I would not be so kind. The projection is dim... can only see it in a dark room, and the numbers when shined on the ceiling from a bed side night stand are not that large. The Oregon Scientific Clocks have larger letters and seem to be a slightly bit brighter. I will say this clock synched much quicker then the OS clocks I have had do. I am located on the coast in the South East and generally have a difficult time with Atomic Clocks."
1,"ok, but there are much better ones...","I regret buying this product. The projected numbers are tiny. Also, there is no way of rotating the angle at which they are projected. It is not worth the money."
2,poor choice,"The projection light is very weak and quite small on the ceiling. The display is too crowded for its size. Took a long time to sync with the atomic signal, longer than advertised."
2,POOR REPAUR SERVICE,PRODUCT MALFUNCTIONED. SENT BACK TO REPAIR DEPARTMENT. THEY'VE HAD IT ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT. IT'S A SIMPLE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT. SHOULDN'T TAKE THIS LONG TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.
4,nice clock,"it works as advertised. I can only see the projected time on the ceiling when it is very dark, but it's not that important to me.I bought this because of the automatic setting with the atomic clock, and use the time to set my manual watches. It does update ever night. However, this clock doesn't display the seconds, which I didn't notice before I ordered it. My fault, not the clock's."
2,"Great potential, poor execution","I like this clock, but it makes me crazy. It resets itself automatically to the correct time when the power goes out, but it forgets what timezone you are in! GMT for everyone until you go back through the infuriating menus using the horrible buttons. The buttons are horrible! You can use a battery, but then it wouldn't have lost the correct time in the first place.Did I say the buttons were horrible? You press as hard as you can, and sometimes they won't click at all and sometimes they double click. Since you can't back up in setting the alarm or anything, if you go past your time due to a double click you have to go all the way around and try again. Don't lose the manual or you will never figure out which horrible button to press in which order. Machiavelli had nothing on the enginerds that came up with this thing.I like the temperature and projection features, they are great. I don't use the alarm anymore and as long as I never have to touch it, we get along fine."
2,technology is for techs not everyday people,"This clock for me was very confusing in how to set. It would be great to simplify. Also it does not shine on ceiling as bright as I had hoped. You can see the numbers, but have to look for them. Also I think it changed to daylight savings before daylight savings had begun (due to the change I'm sure) so rather than have to figure out how to change it and then have to change back, I am having to add a number when I look at it.. It is ok, but was hoping for more."
1,not worth it,"Purchased this clock as an alarm for my bedroom. Projector only projects clearly about 6ft. The alarm can barely be heard. The auto time setter fluctuates. This is not designed for a bedroom, as I thought. Really no worth the money."
2,Light is too dim,"I had a similar product and loved it, but the red projection diodes started failing. This one by La Crosse has such dim projection light that I can't discern the numerals on my standard height ceiling in a totally dark room. Moreover, the backlight on the LCD screen is too dim to adequately illuminate the readout. I consider it either individually defective or universally poorly engineered. The projection feature was the reason I bought it, and I haven't used the alarm function. The company accepts warranty and support claims only by an e-form on their website, stating they are swamped with calls and emails. Maybe there's a reason. I'm awaiting their response."
4,Cool little clock,"This is a small alarm clock but the projection size is actually quite large. It did take almost 24 hours to sync the time and then required time zone setting. But, it's been right on the money since. The temperature readouts are very acurate. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Needlessly overcomplicated instructions,"I bought 4 of these for christmas gifts and ended up needing to set them all up for my elderly and electronically challenged family members. To make a long story as short as possible, this device works but the design and instructions are overly complicated. All one needs to do is:1. Plug it in2. put in the batteries,3. Set the time zone by holding down the ""Mode"" button for 3 seconds. Click the ""Mode"" button until your time zone appears, Click the ""Snooze"" button.4. Set the position of the display (best done in the dark)5. waitThe clock eventually finds the signal and sets itself.I still gave it 4 stars but someone needs to re-vamp the way this item is set up.As someone else stated earlier:""Despite its poor design features, this clock basically works as advertised and is inexpensive. Since most of the time, you won't need to touch it, if you can read relatively dim, red 3"" numbers on your ceiling, then it's probably a good choice. Just don't lose the manual!"""
4,Gr8 @ night,"I like to take this with me on trips so I can tell at night what time it is as I wake up at least 2 times a night, being an old guy. Also like to know the temperature in the room, so I alternate the display on the ceiling. I can set the AC accordingly in the hotel room. Other traveling companions liked it, but I don't think they know how to get one, or, the newness wore off on them. Grandson liked it so I ordered one for him.Good in the mainland, but had a difficult time getting a signal in Hawaii. DST also throws a wrench in the works. A good buy."
3,Wall Mountable? Detachable Stand?,"The product description must be partly for a different clock, as there is no way to detach the stand nor mount it on the wall. Fair value for the features otherwise."
4,Great for it's price,"Great product for a great price... I live in Caracas, Venezuela and I only bought it for the projection and alarm sistem (thinking that the radio signal wouldn't come as far as from Colorado to my humble house in Caracas) but it actually did!! I was amazed when I saw the signal icon on the screen!The projection system works perfectly, and so does the alarm... but I have had a few problems trying to configure the alarm hour because of the tiny button for it... and the led light isn't quite bright too... Still, I'm completly satisfied, but I'll keep the extra star for the perfect and not just great items ;)"
3,Good but projector light is weak,I like the swivel feature of the light but its way too blurry and dim even in total darkness. I have a similar clock by Oregon Scientific which is much brighter and sharper to read.
4,Good clock for the money,"The clock is good quality. Did not have any problem to set it up, but it took about 12 hours for it to sync up. This was on 2 separate clocks in 2 different states."
5,Give us more!,"Even if I wasn't a thirtysomething computer programmer with male pattern baldness and a Mountain Dew belly, I would bump this album!Despite all the clever lyrics and witty references, this album isn't just a vehicle for showing off Frontalot's nerd prowess; it also features stomping beats and creative musicological whatevers and stuff, you know.In other words: this album is the bomb, like, for real."
3,Interesting style...,"I didn't love every song, but they are all pretty good. There are 4 or 5 songs that I liked a lot: Nerdcore Rising, Pr0n Song, Message No. 419 are some. I might buy another album."
4,Excellent,"I am a Monopoly fan, I own 11 versions. Personally, I think that this is one of the best. My friends pick this to play over most others, because the property names are recognizable, while most other games aren't. I think it's a great game for kids 11+."
1,"Um, Hasbro, what happended to e-commerce?",Hasbro screwed up. Isn't it ironic that there is PAPER money in The .com edition of Monopoly? So much for e-commerce in this game and hacking your fellow players for credit card numbers. Guess I'll have to wait for PC version. Hopefully you will be able to play others online or on a LAN.
1,Avoid unless you have significant design experiance!,"Although this book has ""illustrated procedures for solving major pressure vessel design problems"" it is full of errors and typos. Although the second edition has clarified many of the problems in the first edition, the procedures are unclear and significantly flawed. In addition, there are several instances where Mr. Moss fails to define the conditions in which certain equations should be, and should not be used. Unless you have significant experience in designing pressure vessels, avoid this book, it will only cause frustration and poorly designed units."
3,"Good reference book, but beware.","It is a good reference book to have.But, it is not for the inexperienced vessel engineer. It does have typo errors in the formulas (it was worst in the initial edition). To use the book, you do have to know how these formulas are derived and where they came from. If you're not an experienced Engineer and blindly use it as a cook book then you're in for a surprise."
2,Watch out.,"As an engineer trying to come up to speed on pressure vessel design, I must say I found the book confusing. I found two mistakes in the first example I reviewed and wasted several minutes making sure that it wasn't my mistake. I was very disappointed."
3,Nice Lamp,"For the price I wasn't about to go to the trouble of sending it back for replacement. The bottom of the stem wasn't welded properly but it's still stable. It looks like the picture, watch the height so you know what you're getting which is a medium sized lamp. I love it with the round side table. It's just the right amount of ornamental. The colors in the picture are accurate. This would work well on an end table or in a bedroom."
3,The little book of stupid questions,"The little book of stupid questions - very good, love these kind of books - brilliant time waster and conversation starter!"
5,Worth much more than you imagine!,"David Borgenicht's book is actually not as stupid as it seems. Sometimes, those ""embarrassing, personal and basically pointless questions"" can start some seriously entertaining conversations.For example, one of my favorites is, ""Do you think that the first time corn ever popped it scared the hell out of the Indians?""And then, just think about the following question would tell you about your friends and family. ""What would you say as your ""last words"" if you were about to be executed?""The Little Book of Stupid Questions is one of the great ones. I read through most of it in a chain bookstore while waiting for hours for my car to be fixed. After reading the whole thing -- I purchased it, anyway! Don't pass it by as a joke book."
2,Journeys into Time Travel - don't bother,"I bought this as a gift. I had to return the first one and get another one. The first DVD played for a couple of minutes & then nothing. The 2nd DVD would NOT play at all on the regular DVD player, ONLY on a region free DVD player. Also neither one was shrink wrapped or sealed, & was ""bouncing"" around in the case. I was bored after 5 minutes, but then I did buy it as a gift. NOT what I expected for the money."
2,problems,"This is the second dvd I've ordered and it still does the same thing, skips ahead a couple sentences every 40 seconds or so."
5,What is woman?,"Harriet Lerners book Women in therapy was a further step for me (a sociology student) into understanding (?) what the social origins of the oppositional pair - man/woman, are. Lerner explains how the social reproduction of gender(through upbringing etc), to this day, still molds women into stereotypes. This in turn, is the root of many psychological problems that women can develope. The book covers all kinds of social situations and case-studies. If you're interested in gender-issues, this book is for you. // If you want to furher explore the way that language reproduces gender see Miller/Swift ""Words and Women""//"
3,No longer relevant,"I was born in 1975. I am now a wife, a mother and a therapist and I was not able to relate to this book. I think this is a good thing though. Women have come a LONG way. For its time, this was probably a great work, but 30-40 years later it could only be read for nostalgia's sake or as an insight to what our mother's (emotional) lives were like."
5,Great Book Reinforcing Mission Study to younger children,"I teach a missions class for young girls in my church. I found this book, 'Clay Homes', written by Judy Langley and illustrated by Wendy Kikugawa to be simple enough for the children to understand. The large print was easy for my younger students to read, yet the older ones enjoyed reading the story, also. The illustrations by Wendy Kikugawa were colorful and appropriate for the story."
5,Suppression of Academic Freedom,"In 1993, Doctor Tony Martin, a highly respected historian with many academic credentials, quoted from the book, ""The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews"", during just one African-American History class period. ""The Secret Relationship"" uses Jewish historical records to prove who owned the majority of slave ships and slave auction houses. For Dr. Martin's indescretion, he was targeted by the Jewish student organization, Hillel, the B'nai B'rith and the Anti-Defamation League.This book documents many of the events that transpired at Wellesley College after the smear campaign began."
5,Excellent,"After I borrowed this DVD from our local library, I knew that I must own it. It provides a world-class classical experience--on demand--for less than the cost of a concert ticket.The Four Seasons especially was beautifully rendered. Another exceptional rendering was the Brandenburg concerto. Here is a clip from it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RNNmQFaWEThe timeless beauty of the renderings defies description.I do not hesitate to recommend this DVD."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS....,THE PROGRAM AND THE PERFORMERS ARE O.K. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST PERFORMANCES ARE ALIVE WITH REALLY OLD SOUND RECORDING EQUIPMENT AND WITH LOUD BACKGROUND NOISE. GENERALLY NOT AN ITEM FOR FINE EARS...IT HAS FAR TO GO TO THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF NOWADAYS 5.1 DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND (WITH NO BACKGROUND NOISE).
1,RedXpress is a horrible company with horribe product,I would not advise anyone to purchase software from this company. I sent them numerous emails regarding a problem I was having. All were ignored. I finally called them. I got some guy in California who said my emails were going to tech support in Europe. They were having a problem getting the Europeans to response to all tech support questions. My advice to RedXpress is don't sell to the U.S if you don't want to speak to an American. The guy from California provided some help. After I got off the phone with him I tried his suggestions none of them worked. Sent him emails and he never responded. I don't even use the software anymore. It ruined too many DVDs to make it worth my while.
4,Great Product,"I bought this product two months ago to be able to backup my DVD movies and especially my episodic discs. I tried using 321 studios DVD X Copy but that didn't work very well for my copy of the Simpsons. Copyware worked brilliantly on it. There were a few technical glitches at first (I'm using Windows 98), but the Redxpress support people were on top of it. They've made fixes available for download from their website. Now the product works great and I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it."
1,A total waste of money- Just did not work,"I brought this product in May 2004- I had researched alternative software that do the same stuff, and I was convinced by the comments seen on Amazon to try this product out. From the beginning it never worked.I even downloaded version 3 to see if it helped-Same results. It just freezes my computer and forces me to turn of the computer to get out. I emailed Redexpress.com (their support) to get assistance and was asked to send the log file so that they could identify the problem. I did that on 3 occasions. Got no response apart from an automatic acknowledgemnent of my email.I have just sent them another message as a last attempt.If that does not work, I expect that someone should refund my money because it just never worked."
1,Save your money!,"I have tried about two dozen DVD movies, different blank DVD manufacturers, three different DVD players, so far - zero success. Original purchase did not work, the next two updates did not work. They won't let registered users access the latest release V3.0, their response to email's is to return a blank screen, ha ha, aren't they funny. If all you need to do is copy a single disk movie, then it's ok, but if the output needs to span two disks, then the results are completely unpredictable. Some times the first disk works but the second doesn't, sometimes the other way around. Sometimes the movie's menu works on one disk but not the other. Sometimes the product just hangs during the copy procedure forcing a hard shutdown of the computer. I recommend against this product, freeware like shrink is my choice."
1,"so far, so bad. dvd copyware underachieves","From it's inability to copy episodic dvd's, to it's inability to make a workable dvd, this product has been a disappointment. So far, ive made one solid workable dvd(from about 20 attempts). Red express offers support though, through software fixes and upgrades through its website. They also promise a full upgrade to it's next software release!( due in 4th quarter of 2003). Let's hope it's a better offering than it's current package."
5,Playo media works fine,I've used DVD-R for over 1 year now and I have not had a bad disk yet. Recommended for budget recording.
4,Comprehensive Presentation,"This book is much more detailed than suggested by it's description on the Amazon website, a bit comprehensive for a beginner like myself. It does do a good job of introducing the various period furniture styles and educates the collector about repairs, reproductions and intelligently inspecting period furniture you are interested in purchasing."
4,For Math Heads Only,"This is a `Math-Head's' calculator. They say it is for `high school' ... who are they trying to kid. It is neat the way many of HP's RPN things are. [I am only an electronc's nerd not a mathman and way past highschool [by 40 years] by the way]. O.K. so its has constants and neat conversions and can do math stuff on it that I don't think I''ve ever seen : -) but, hey, for high school? I have a grand nephew doing time there now and he told me that 3 kids in his pre calculus class tried these but only for a week before they went back to their vastly more expensive graphing TIs or their pretty low priced TI and HP scientific calculators.. But as I wrote this is a neat calculator and the price ---wow--- but high school? No."
3,Sharp EL-506WBBK Scientific Calculator,"this product is friendly use. however the battery container is sensitive, if it fall the battery circuit will broken down."
1,POS,No POS is not a math term. This calculator is a piece of #$%^. Unless you are an engineer or have access to someone who can explain to you why when squaring the sum of two exponents you need a bevy of parentheses you are wasting your time with this. The manual is pretty much a joke being that nothing is explained to any degree. For what it it worth you are better off buying a graphing calc for anything real and a simple calc with DMS for trig. If you accidentally change a setting you are left with resetting the whole calculator. Just frustrating as hell.
2,Not So Good If Keys Go Bad!!,"Well, it worked for sixteen months before numeric keys 5 and 6 stopped working -- four months beyond the warranty limit. When comparable Sharp calculators were still being made in Malaysia they were excellent. Granted, this one may have more features but what good is it with two bad keys? I probably will not buy the Sharp brand again if I have a decent alternative. I own another Sharp model, the 516, which I bought at the same time and it is still working fine (for now, that is). They are certainly feature-rich, but I don't want to buy a new one every 1-2 years -- that is ridiculous.I have a Casio solar-powered calculator purchased in the early 1980s. It only stopped working properly about three years ago, so that Casio provided me considerable service for 25 years. Its failure led me to buy several new ones for home and work, but, may I say, they sure don't make them like they used to! Has it become a race to the bottom for quality of components and manufacturing?"
5,Still swinging pretty,"I'm not sure there ever was, or will be a better show band than Louis Prima, Keely Smith and Sam Butera and the witnesses, but at the same time, Keely had many recordings of her own.I think I've got them all.I couldn't wait for this cd to come out and am certainly not disappointed! The pure voice and fire are still there. A must for the music lover"
4,Keely Smith sings Sinatra,I really enjoyed the style and content of this CD. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys style of music.
2,great voice--foul mouth,"I heard Keely sing on Pandora and was so impressed with her voice that I immeadiately bought this CD on Amazon and my listening pleasure was ruined by her foul language that she engages in from time to time. Not every track but -- who needs it. Amazing singing ability, tho, great rendition of standards that I love. I'll stick with Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, Rosemary Clooney...etc."
1,Don't Be Mis-Led by the Positive Reviews!,"Buy a CD from when Ms. Smith was younger. This is a woman in her 70's singing on these CDs, and it is obvious. Her voice is not a strong voice of someone in her youth, but she still tries to sing as if it is, and it just hurts. Also, for some reason, her pronounciation of her vowels has changed from her earlier recordings. To my ear, she is mis-prounouncing words, and it is very annoying. Save your money......don't be duped......buy her original stuff. I've waited over a month to write this review, setting the CD aside and giving it chance after chance, but it remains like fingernails on a chalkboard as compared to what I was expecting to hear."
3,Needs work,"The game is just average, It is hard to get in a fight with one racer, the mercy rule made it to easy to win races at the last second, and the bike selection was poor. This is better left to be a rental."
5,A MUST for any N64 collection!,"Road Rash is well on its way to eating up every single moment of my spare time! This game just plain rocks. From the hardrock soundtrack to the excellent graphics and game play, this game makes having an N64 a MUST. Even though it took me only a few days to win every race and qualify on every level, I continue to work through the levels time and again to buy new bikes and find new weapons and paths. Well worth every penny -- and with my Amazon $10 off coupon, my bro will be enjoying it come Xmas as well."
4,Good sport if a bit disappointing,"One of the few ""fast"" games which allows a new player to ""acclimatize"" him or herself to the game before real speed is introduced. That's a plus (unless you're a return player). It's also addictive -- plugged in this game time and time again, though have won 7 times. Secondary complaint: too few levels (only 5) and too few races in each level. The moment of greatest success and, wham, you're finished. Main complaint: being a COP does not mean you are on the Police Force and get to bust the bikers, only that a biker in a Police uniform is in the race. That is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I was looking forward to busting rather than being busted, maybe even driving a police car instead of a cycle. Programmers, observe: you have a good game that would have achieved greatness had you only included a complete COP function. Next time, please do so!"
2,Interesting more to those who have already been there.,"This book is very personal, exposing intimate details of the life of a famous musician in Mali. I was embarrassed on his behalf, and wondered if he knows what this author did to him. Apart from that, given its shortcomings, such as personal bias and structural weakness, it was interesting to read. I'm not sure, however, if someone who had never been to West Africa, and in particular Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, would understand it fully."
2,A disappointing hodge-podge,"The book splits evenly into two halves. The first half recounts Joris's travels in Senegal and Mauritania (the book's high point), and introduces us to Mali. The second half, also dealing with Mali, is an account of her friendship with the singer Boubacar Traore, and her efforts to delve into his personal life. Traore comes across as an abrasive and tempermental character; it's very odd that he should be the focus of the book. Joris's writing style at the beginning of the book relies on indirect quotations instead of actual dialogue, which makes it quite dry; later in the book the writing quality improves markedly where dialogue is concerned. This is more the memoirs of Traore than a travel narrative. It's a sad oversight (but emblematic of the book's flaws) that her only visit to Mali's Dogon region is one day-trip, recounted in a few pages that highlight Traore's role as her guide rather than the Dogon people."
4,You'll never see tea the same,"Osho tries hard to differentiate himself from dogma, classification, and even Zen. His book, 'The art of tea' is no different. Osho talks highly of tea, and one can't help seeing tea in an almost divine light after reading the book. To Osho, tea is religion, zen, and life itself. A cup of tea is not only great before meditation (to stay awake) but is a meditation in itself.The book is pocket sized and can be read in a matter of hours. The prose is simple and clean, with the reader wanting more of Oshos inexplainable teaching. Not to worry, Osho has 600 books and thousands of audio discourses."
5,Excellent!!,"Amazing!!I ordered this item one night. The next morning, I found myself opening the bubble wrapper to find a brand new book, not even one blemish, just as described, including the CD, which was never opened either.I am impressed. I totally recommend Jack's Rarities.Now, if you allow me, I'll proceed to enjoy this marvel, totally Sienkiewicz, totally Hendrix..."
2,"Comics are for the Sunday Paper, not Jimi Hendrix","This one left me a bit short. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform at the Cafe Wa in Greenwich Village, NY. Also saw his 1968 Experience concerts in Hartford at the Bushnell Memorial concert hall and outdoors at the Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood, CA and he was amazing! This comic depiction is not completely accurate and since I was there it does not hit home for me since the information is off and not overly complete. Nice try, collectable, but not for the purist Hendrix fan. The CD which comes inside rear cover is a nice touch and bonus almost worth the price of the book. I even found a mint copy of this book missing the CD, pouch there unopened, but missing the CD in error!"
2,Warning to Charlotte Church fans!!,"To Charlotte Church fans who are considering the purchase of this DVD for the Charlotte Church performance only, reconsider. ""Danny Boy"" is straight and unadulterated off of ""Voice of an Angel in Concert"". Save your money if Charlotte Church is the only reason you are considering this. You already have it."
2,Shostokovich's Musical,"Since this production had received good reviews, I was extremely disappointed with it. I have a recording of the complete work and have seen it on stage, so this rushed, re-arranged, badly dubbed, and ragged ill treatment hit me with disbelief. The plot is rather slender to hang all of Shostokovich's music on, but the full musical (it's not intended to be an opera) is delightful. All I can say is that this version is better than nothing. Barely."
5,Music at home,This one's for me. I bought/donated several of these through my church at a much higher price than I was able to get at Amazon.
2,MIxed messages,"Some good dog advice, but some off-the-wall comments as well. E.g. in talking about dogs left home alone and destruction, she suggests on p 44 you ""say to your dog in a commanding tone'Watch the house.' Your tone tells the dog it has something to do, and it will indeed do it - ..."" Sorry, dogs don't work that way in my experience. Some of the grids and charts seem like a personal perspective that isn't necessary to the discussion. A lot of 'authority figure' discussions that are less useful than behavior modeling from other trainers. I'd go with someone like Karen Pryor or Ian Dunbar's books instead."
1,It doesn't stink!,"Too bad, I really wanted to play a trick on someone, but alas, it didn't even stink! Gave it away!"
3,worse than a fart,"This stuff is putrid. It does not smell like any fart we have smelled and you will gag. Do not spray this indoors - it takes a lot to get the smell out. If you do spray it on someone's clothes - the smell does wash out, however we do not recommend doing that. Not sure this is even funny because the smell is so bad."
2,Its ok but smells horrible,The smell is not a fart smell. Does not even smell like stink bombs. The smell also leaks out of the can when it is sitting idle.
3,"It stinks alright, just not like a fart...","I bought a few of these mostly to terrorize my friends and family with. I was hoping for something that'd be a typical silent stinko, with the whole ""silent but deadly"" thing. Well, firstly, this spray doesn't spray silently, thus ruining the first part of the fun. Second, while the smell of this thing is horrendous (I still have to run after I spray them), it doesn't smell like a fart. It just smells like...well, I'm not sure what it smells like, but if someone smelled like this, they would need to see a doctor.So, all in all, this thing does stink, just not like the title and description lead you to believe they would or should."
3,Super Fart Spray,Disgusted with the shipping charge. An $8 order had a $21.90 shipping charge added--That's robbery! If I returned the order....I'd be out the shipping to get it back. The way Amazon has this laid out makes it hard to see this kind of ridiculous fee. Very unhappy.
5,Watch the Sunrise...,"There's a very special track on this album, called ""Flamingo Feast""--or track number 2.When I listen to this excellent piece of music and nature sounds I feel as if I'm in Eastern Africa, early in the morning, and observing a large flock of flamingos. There's mist in the air, and a special coolness, but warmth in the sky. Suddenly the sun begins to rise with the increasing rhythm of the music, and you are watching a visual feast!This one track always makes me feel SO alive and yet, relaxed. I reccommend this album to anyone who dreams of going to Africa, but can't live up to it yet! You truly will get a sense of this land...and for a great price."
4,Spirit Of Africa,Nice relaxing CD that leaves a person feeling happy and vibrant. The mix of animal sounds and rhythmic music gives the CD a really soothing yet inspiring quality. My two year old loves bopping to it.
3,African ambient music,"This was a quiet and peaceful CD.I probably could have had a little more beat to it for me, but I still found it relaxing and enjoyable"
5,Perfect for Small Digital Cameras,This is a great case for small cameras. My kids have the Kodak C530's and they fit perfectly in the case.
4,Works good,"These work pretty well for most of my rings. I actually bought it for my husband, but they weren't quite big enough so I have started using them. They stand up pretty well, but the metal ends are sharp and can catch skin or clothes. So use caution."
4,4 stars,"Overall, I give this novel a 4 because it wasn't quite as exciting as the others on ""The American Family Portrait Series"", of course, I have high expectations of Cavanaugh because he is my favorite writer. This is a good read though, it took me a little longer to read then the others. I do recommend this book for teens and adults alike, that is, if you like exciting, action packed Christian novels."
5,Great book series,"My hometown library had only two books of the series so I ordered several more and will order the rest soon, either in book form or for my Kindle Fire. Great service and very convenient!"
5,What a beautiful book!,"It made me laugh; it made me cry; it touched me deeply. The author has a passion for life that is clearly portrayed in the words of her poems. She speaks of faith and fear, of the pain of loss and of artistic endeavor. She has the courage to speak of things that most of us try our hardest to bury deep within out heart. I thoroughly enjoyed being captivated by her words, and look forward to future publications."
2,Waste of your money. Buy the Prima Guide,"This guide has no detail at all.In this guide, they give you one caption on important things, but the Prima Guide gives a whole page on the same thing. For example, this guide tells you where the items are in Victory Road. It has three pictures of Victory Road but does not tell you how to get through the Victory Road cave. I dont get why they would tell you were the items are when you don't know how to get them, it's just moronic.Furthermore, they do not in anyway tell you where to catch any of the pokemon except for Rayquaza.This guide gives you the title of the pokemon's ability, but it doesnt explain what the ability does. It does not tell you what the pokemon is weak or strong against. The Prima Guide is the way to go."
5,Love IT!,Great Product. Helps you through the whole game! Tells you where literally everything is and helps you catch them all. Which I did for my DS games!
5,Turkey through Eyewitness Travel Guide,"ET Guide's are worthy of a place with coffee table books. I am reading it before the trip and, although heavier than other guides on the market, I will take it with me because of the graphics and details, plus other useful info."
1,Lots of basic information - but no ratings or opinion,This book was just a bunch of information about Turkey that any other guidebook would have. It has no opinions or recommendations. I sold this book and bought other guides instead.
3,"Nice pole, but the picture isn't accurate","Pole looked like a standard medium action pole in the picture, but once I received it it surely wasn't. It's got an extra foot of handle compared to the picture and it's not cork...it's foam! The reel is the size of a grapefruit! It appears to be a deep sea pole, but the product numbers match. Overall it appears to be a good pole and I'm keeping it in hopes of finding a use for it one day"
1,delta truck box,Product was received damaged due to inappropriate packaging. Box was priviously opened and packing material was not put back in the box. Box was retaped poorly. Product dented and scratched
1,Don't buy it if you care to see HDTV channels,The cutoff corner frequency for the RF protection is too low such that none of the High Definnition channels are going through. I hope the 3600 Joule protection works !!!I rate this product a 2 out of 5. By the way the rating on this website is broken (I can not change the 1 star that this review shows)
5,first time reviewer,I am as happy as one can be with the seamless integration of a surge suppressor with all the inputs/outputs I needed at a very reasonable price. I hope I do not need to use the dollar coverage for disabled units. I had lightning strike five times over a few years...we will see how this works.
4,Hoppe's Deer Target,Excellent target!! Gives you plenty to aim at and the the placement of the zones are perfect.
5,Good for Beginners,These are Perfect for my cousin who wants to start hunting this year it took me a while to do this review because i wanted to test them and they are impressive BUT and only one is its hard to see the bullet holes I shoot a 3006 and 270 and i cant see holes sometimes then again i might be shooting in the same place but overall a solid 5
4,edger blades,"I cannot find this product at any local store, so I ordered it on Amazon. These blades seem to be better quality than the original manufacturer product. They do a better job and do not seem to wear as quickly. I recommend them"
5,The Best Reggae Music,I listened this music ten years ago ... only one time and i never forget it !!! for me John Holt is the best reggae man in the world.
1,Better than nothing,This manual was pretty much useless for what I needed to know about rebuilding the engine. Alldata repair had all the good info... but ya gotta pay. And this thing does not run on Vista. I had to find someone with XP to load it and transfer all the PDF files with are not titled well at all.
5,tools,This is one nice set of short metric allen wrench socket set for the price. I highly recommend these to anyone. Excellent price.
1,Defective on Arrival,"I too, was impressed by the packaging and apparent quality of this hex bit set, as other reviewers were, given the low price. Then I looked at the 5.5mm hex bit. It was out of alignment with the socket. That's bad. It kind of looked like the leaning tower of Pisa in the socket. I also thought the 5mm hex bit was off, but not as much as the 5.5mm, and I didn't have precise enough tools with me to analyze it. Unfortunately, the 3, 4, 5, 5.5 & 6mm hex bits were what I bought this set for, as they are used a lot in bicycle maintenance and repair. Amazon did not offer to replace it, just return it, which was not much of a hassle -- print out the forms, put one in the package, and tape the address label on the outside. Drop off at the Post Office."
5,You need these if you work on a bicycle,"I've been working on bicycles for many years, always using the old L-shaped hex keys. I never really thought about how much time I wasted trying to find the right one for each screw. It turns out it was a lot. These things are incredibly handy. It only took one bike repair session to make me feel I'd gotten my money's worth. An added plus is that I can now use a torque wrench when working on carbon fiber frames.Fit and finish on the sockets is perfect, they come in a nice case, and they're inexpensive. It really is a no-brainer purchase."
5,Much better than allen wrenches!,"If you've ever worked on an import bike which uses allen screws/nuts, then like me you've probably stripped a bunch and had to use an easy-out to get them. This is a great set which you use with your regular socket ratchets (1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 square drive) and you'll find you strip things far less! I believe you could also use an impact driver with these, but I haven't had to try that yet.For those critical engine bolts, finally you can use your torque wrench to make sure you get the tensions just right, instead of guessing with the L shaped drivers."
5,tool set,Am very pleased with my purchase as it is a well designed addition to my beginning tol kit and will be an asset to me in my small motorcycle repairs.
5,Great tool set,"This set is perfect. I only needed a few for torqueing by bike and Motorcycle but the price was so good I was able to get a set of them. I have research Allen Hex bit socket sets for a while, they are very pricey even for just a few. Each one would cost around $4. I am happy with the quality they will last almost forever."
1,confusing - beware,"These are not hex nut sockets as the name implies. Rather they are hex drivers on a 1/4"" socket etc."
4,Nice set . . . .,"The sockets are good quality. While I have not used all of them, the ones I did use are solid and well constructed. No issues or problems with them at this point."
2,Only read if you want to be left depressed and angry,"I want to give this book only 1 star, but as I actually managed to finish it, I will reserve my 1 star rating for books I cannot even finish they are so horrible. Don't read this book if you are a practicing Christian, pro-life, optimistic about the world's future, or looking for a fairy tale romance novel. Do read this book if you hate the current state of the world, like depressing novels, don't want the ""disney"" ending, or like other books written by the author. I read the Kindle version of this book and there were a lot of typos. I am not sure if that was due to the Kindle translation or if the novel itself was that poorly written and edited. As some other reviewers stated, I was left feeling angry that I wasted my time with this novel. I kept reading hoping for some turn in the story to make it worth the read. I will not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Beauty Says It All,I have read this book on several occasions and found it here again looking for a gift for someone. A wonderful story. It works on many levels and Ms. Tepper's vision of our world's future is all to plausible and painful to contemplate.
2,depressing,"I got his book thinking that it would be great. I love fairy tale retellings and this looked like a great one. It started out good, and I really liked that it had more than one fairy tale in it. I even liked the part when she went to faerie. I love faeries! but from there it seemed to be going nowhere. It was depressing that she got old so fast, and had almost no good life. After reading this I didn't want to read for a while, because it made me so upset. Some people may like this book, but I sure didn't"
4,THIS BOOK DREW ME IN....,"I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK. THERE IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE HERE. YOU HAVE THE FAIRY TALES, THE CHINANGA SCENES REMIND ME OF A SERIES BY JASPER FFORDE (THE EYRE AFFAIR/THE WELL OF LOST PLOTS), THERE ARE JULES VERNE REFERENCES A'LA THE TIME MACHINE. TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO READS A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOKS, YOU WILL NEVER BE BORED READING BEAUTY.I AM DEFINETLY GOING TO READ MORE OF THIS AUTHORS' WORK."
3,Sheri has a really awesome writing skill but...,"Sheri has a way of making the characters come to life and you fell like you are there experiencing what Beauty experienced. I am disappointed though, that she had to go into some much detail with Jaybee raping her and her making love to Edward and Giles. Also I did not like the language she used and some of the things that she wrote go against everything I have ever been taught. Yet, I liked how she put all these fairy tales into one person and therefore I read on despite everything else."
1,"So disturbing, I wish I hadn't read it.","I liked the initial idea of Tepper's book, which deals with a dynasty of fairy tale characters, however I did not like the execution. I share Tepper's philosophy that stories can change the world, however, I found this dark tale, involving mass suicide by the inhabitants of an overpopulated world hypocritical to her own thesis that humans need beauty to survive."
5,"IT'S BEAUTY, LITERALLY","I am not really what anyone would call a very literate person, i have done all the classics, and the ones that enter my hands, but by all means beauty stays in my mind. You don't forget it's tecture, personality, love, lust, and, most importantly, it's life. It's a fantastic book. My mother put it in my hands, and it stayed there for the days that it took me to finish it. And it still lives deep within my heart. There is no word good enough to describe this book. After I read it,I went after all the rest of Tepper's works, and have been fully satisfied with each and every one. She is brilliant, one of the best authors I have had the privilage of being introduced to. I recommend Beauty to anyone who loves fantasy, actually, I could clearly say that I think that it should be required reading. Out of a possible 5 stars, I would give it 6."
4,A Wonderful Trip!,"I, as it seems many others have, read Beauty for the first time about 10 years ago. I was thrilled as the story proceeded to intertwine the ""princess"" fairy tales with some twists! I was touched by the insight with which she described the world's waning humanity. It was not hard to devour the story with Tepper's eloquent descriptions and well defined characters. This book does indeed take you to another time and place...to many in fact. I applaud her artistic imagination and thank her for sharing with us. Beauty was and is a delight."
3,No gate to women's country,"I originally bought this book because I loved the aforementioned novel. I couldn't describe beauty has a ""bad book"" but I must say it's only for a certain type of person who likes a certain type of genre. For me, time travel and other nonsenses bore me but this is a fantasy novel so for those who love fantasy may enjoy it. The only thing to really complain about was that it took me over half the book to really get into it. The character's in the book are pretty well developed except her love interest, he was a bit lame. At the end of the book I did not regret reading it and thought it to be extremely creative with a very good message."
4,Not for the P.C. Police,"if you want to experience what it felt like to sit through Dean Martin's nightclub act, then sit back and enjoy this CD. He sings, clowns around, tells jokes, and makes eveybody feel glad they are there. A lot of his humor is off-color and by today's standards, the P.C. police would be all over him for some of the things he says. That's why it's great!"
4,A classic live Deano with a caveat emptor,"First remind yourself that you've purchased a live CD from 1964, so the sound quality isn't perfect but it should always have a *little* hiss when it's live, right?Anyway....this is a fine example of Dean Martin playing his crowd while crooning some of his signatures. Here is my caveat: If you don't want to hear Dean deliver some of the same exact jokes (and even song arrangements) as he does on ""The Rat Pack: Live at the Sands"" Cd, then don't buy this CD.But overall, I am happy I have it as any Rat Pack music is good music, and I figure it's OK for some of it to be repeated. He was probably drunk and forgot he told the same jokes :)"
3,Taj Mahal - Shoutin In Key,"As an avid fan of Taj's work for over two decades I am sorry to say that this album misses the benchmark that Taj has set from his earlier works. The Phantom Blues band is tight and on top of it's game but Taj does not rise to the meet the rest of the band. For a really good live album check out An Evening Of Acoustic Music, recorder live in Germany."
3,"Care for an appetizer anyone? Wine, cheese and blues perhaps","Virtuosic playing and uncommonly clean sound quality aside, the diversity of material prevents this set from ever catching fire. It's a collection of appetizers that never adds up to a full meal."
1,Too big!,Previous comments were about right...it's too big so it doesn't work in his mouth very well but does feel great! The only thing is he can't do it for very long. I don't remember why something about it hitting his teeth I think...so really it feels good but if you only get it for 30 seconds it isn't that worth it.
2,ETC Ministries Review of The Rapture Trap,"Dr. Thigpen does a decent exploratory on the Rapture theory. But on the flip side, he seems to go beyond the scope of the Rapture theory and it's origin by defending Catholicism and bashing Protestant's belief system. I think this lessens his credibility. In lieu of defending/bashing, he could have written more about the various scriptures related to the Rapture and the dissected meanings based upon Greek linguistics.Ken Parks, ETC Ministries"
1,Deceptive - No Real Backbone for Statements,"I am very disappointed to read a book that deceives and mocks the truth and then offers an independent opinion. These people twist everything into a knot just to get your money for the book and then you believe it! The Bible is the oldest, most dependable resource. Don't leave what others write in a book. Use your own analytical thinking skills to decipher the truth. Blasphmous fools will try to decrease the credibility of the bible for their OWN PROFIT."
5,Argues against rapture using Scripture and history,"...Dr. Thigpen DOES give clear information using scripture and history of why the rapture is never going to happen. If you don't believe me, read it for yourself.(And by the way, if you would like an idea of what fundamentalists really think about who will be raptured, glance through Mark Hitchcock's book ""Is America in Bible Prophecy?"" Mr. Hitchcock says that only evangelical Christians who believe you are saved by faith alone with be raptured. Therefore, if you think that how you actually live your live has ANYTHING to do with salvation, even if you have more faith than anyone else, you will not be raptured and will not be saved. This is an example of the subtle anti-Catholic agenda at work here.)God bless you all."
5,Should be read by everyone who enjoys the Left Behind series,"This book's focus is on1) the theological basis (and history) of the rapture belief;2) its implications for Christians; and3) the errors and misrepresentations included in the book Tribulation Force, which is an early episode of the Left Behind series.In addition, I want to commend the author for an unusually good (and brief) explanation of Christian teaching regarding why mankind's circumstances called for a Messiah, and what His coming means for us born after His life on earth.Highly recommended."
4,"Not the easiest read, but worth the effort","The only star missing here is because of one of the book's strengths, and that is due to its thorough historical and Scriptural exegesis - which makes it a little verbose and tough to digest at times.Not that it's a bad thing - the concepts discussed are highly complex, from eschatological expectations throughout history to symbolism in 1st Century literature, both of which are deeply germane to the topic and support the differences in understanding that arise among 21st century readers from 1st century communications.This is an effective and thorough undertaking of Rapture, one of the many ""Traditions"" adhered to by evangelicals."
3,A different kind of read,"I just finished reading this book. It was okay. I usually don't read books by males but I thought I would give him a try. The book talked about the relationships between three women. All of the women had some deep issues that they needed to work on. I think this would be a good book for a mother and daughter to read. It was shocked by how well Mr. Haynes portrayed the three women. The male characters in the book were not a major major part of the book. Usually men have a better male point of view than a woman's. The title is actually what the book is all about. A pageant so if you are someone that doesn't like pageants, don't read this book. Overall, I would reccommend this book. I will continue to give Mr. Haynes my support."
3,It's a keeper. Not a sleeper.,Once I got a chance to read at length the charcaters were very interesting. I would have loved to hear more about Mark. Deneen reminded me of my (crazy) self. Her mother was hilarous. Looking to read more from the author. He had Deneen talking like a sister. Even though he is a brother. Thanks for a good read.
2,Disappointing...,"I have heard great things about this book. I was anxious to read it. Initially funny, but slow. Finally, I could no longer handle Deneen's blue light pity-party and abandoned the book. Best wished to the author, but not my kind of read."
1,Total Waste of brain energy,To make a long story short (like this book should have done) this novel lacks fire. The characters are predictable and the story line is boring.
1,boring - hard to read,"i tried unsuccessfuly to read this book and could not get into it. America Dream Doll should have been named ""american What""the book was boring, boring, boring. hard to read easy to put down. i love to read novels by african american writers but i will never reccomend this book"
2,"Good Book, Bad Index","This is a good book: a set of columns, written by Lois Adams, that appeared in a Detroit newspaper in 1863 through 1865. Adams was a clerk in the Agriculture Department, so her vision of Washington was less lofty than Brooks or other correspondents; she focuses on the weather, fashions, and the Agriculture Department. BUT the book is rendered far less useful by its awful index. I knew the book mentioned Seward, because I had seen a reference elsewhere, but he is not in the index. A patient search through the text found several references. A quick check revealed other names not indexed, including those of some Michigan men in Washington hospitals. No index is perfect, but this one mars the whole book."
4,challenging but easy,"My daughter, just now 8, and myself played three games in a row right away. I feel this game helps with telling time or at least putting events in sequence. To make it last longer, we did up the amount of villians needed for a win from four to seven because the game was going too quickly. My daughter didn't lose interest until the third game and that is about a miracle. I am sure we will be playing this game for a long time to come."
2,didn't like it,My daughter played the game twice and the excitement ended. My excitement ended while reading the directions. There's just too much involved. The game's too complicated for an adult and too boring for a kid. If you're looking for a game to just sit down and play with your family. No no for this one.
3,needs updating,"This little volume has all the information you need to get started. It has not been updated however, so some of the language might be in question with certain readers. Needs spell-checking as well. But, if you can forgive these concerns, you will learn much by simply following the directions given. Happy tracking!"
4,Celebrate your Creative Self: over 25 Dxercises to Unleash the Artist Within,"Celebrate Your Creative Self: Over 25 Exercises to Unleash the Artist WithinHave not had time to use a lot of the activities, but there seems to be some really creative acitivies that interest me."
3,"Great exercises, misleading title","Like the other reviews state, this exercises in this book are great; in many ways, it IS a workshop in a book. However, I think the title, the subtitle in particular, is slightly misleading. There isn't much in this book to really ""unleash the artist within."" Instead, the exercises provide more of a ""how to"" achieve this or that effect. If you want a book to tell you how to create paintings using a less than ""normal"" technique, this is the book for you; if you want a book, to ""unleash the artist within,"" I would keep looking."
5,Great Book,"I heartily recommend this book for instructors and students alike. It is full of great ideas, demos, exercises. I have used it extensively in my workshops. Very useful addition to any mixed media artist's library"
5,Outstanding,"I love this book! I am a ""self taught"" painter. I'd been struggling with new ideas...didnt know how to acheive what I wanted. I saw this book and decided to give it a looksee. I am extemely happy with it. It answered many of my questions and I am back on the creative road."
5,Excellent!,Have enjoyed playing with all the ideas in this book. The exercises are very well presented and make great 'starts' in spurring your imagination.
4,An inspiring and positive book,"I wish this book wasn't so much about painting, as I do mixed media and textiles primarily, but it taken as a book to inspire creativity - and some painting is a good tool for my box as well - it is very good. The writer is inspiring without being cloying, which so many writers of inspiration creativity books tend to be. I would recommend it to any painter, and artists from other areas might find it a good read as well."
4,Great chalk reel,"Love these things, for roofing, wall layouts, or as bare strings for stringing walls, floors, and roofs. Durable construction, however the chalk bottle could be a little tougher."
5,Best Show Ever!,"If you have never seen this show on PBS I suggest you rent or buy it. This is such a funny show. Both actors are great and very funny. I'm 31 grew up watching BBC shows on PBS and all have been great and this has been added to the list of great BBC shows. And since there is nothing really on TV to watch anymore I would suggest getting ""Two's Company"", kick back and begin the laughter. Now there are a few episodes that are-ok but it is still worth the purchase."
5,Blair Reader--- Full and Divers,"This book was a core requirement for my freshman english class in college. It is a great text that familiarizes the student with many diverse writing styles and subjects, as well as the essentials of analyzing and interpreting literature. Though this is no doubt a dread to most college students, I really enjoyed the discussion in-class that was brought about by entries in this book (and i'm not even a nerdy English major!). One that stands out to me is an excerpt from Jonathan Kozol on illiteracy in america. I wrote an in-depth analysis of that work for the class, and have kept the skills I learned to this day. Whether used as a text, for leisurely reading, or for exposure to critical thought, the Blair Reader is an exellent volume. I highly recommend this book (even if your Enlgish professor doesn't make you buy it!)."
3,Good quality Ashkenazi-style CD,"The singer's voice and melodies on this CD are quite beautiful, but I would caution potential buyers that the lyrics are sung in a very strong Orthodox/Ashkenazi accent (e.g. 'shabbos' instead of 'shabbat'), making it a challenge to use this CD for learning the songs if you are interested in following the modern/Sephardic pronunciation."
4,Good introduction to peaceful parts of Vietnam War,"I enjoyed this book as a non-veteran. It made much of the military history I have read more ""real,"" by looking at it from the perspective of regular GIs. From the technophilia of the Vietnam Army to the disasterous Zero Defects Policy, the famous aspects of warfighting are presented as every-day minutae. Recommended."
5,A Triumph!,"This is M*A*S*H, taken from behind the Korean lines, set down in the rear-echelon of steamy Bangkok--titillated with the tinkle of Thai laughter and temple bells. And it is an even funnier triumph of man over military madness."
3,more slice of life than a story,"I guess I expected more based on the other reviews. There isn't really any plot, a lot of fairly realistic descriptions of bar & brothel scenes. Your basic ""the army is f***ed, officers are f***ed"" kind of story.I've spent some time in Bangkok, and rural Thailand, I was never in the army.The book is amusing, but that's it."
3,"Wonderful product, terrible price","The cost at Amazon ($8.99, at this review) is more than twice the price at which it is sold at my local Walgreen's & CVS."
5,Worth the Price! A fun read!,"The characters in this novel are three dimensional and likeable, and make the reader care about them. The world is colorful, filled with magic and mystery. I particularly admired the way the author handled the appearance of a dragon and the forest filled with magical folk, such as fairies, sprites, gnomes, and the like. Their guardian, a powerful, godlike female spirit, was depicted with intelligence and imagination.The mixture of science fiction and fantasy in this novel is handled with creativity and adds to the reading experience. The plotting is well done and the characters' hopes and goals are believable. I found myself turning the pages with a sense of anticipation, and was very satisfied at the end of the read.A fun book. I'm so glad I already have the sequel."
5,Wizard's Bane,Great fun!!! Kept me reading late into the night and I couldn't wait to read the next book.
5,Publisher's Review,"If you had a father or grandfather who fought in WWII, then you'll want to read this book. It will help you understand what he faced during the fighting and also what he faced when he came home. As Americans worry today about the prospects of war, we all wonder what it would be like. How will war affect our sons and daughters or our spouses and the loved ones they return to. My Father's Eyes takes you on a journey from the battlefields of Italy back home to the United States. You'll learn to love these characters, in spite of their faults, and cheer their tenacity to hold on to each other. This first novel by Jim Loose is written with such gut-wrenching emotions, wartime terrors, and family dynamics that the story will stay with you long after you finish reading it."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"A major disappointment. Cardboard characters, unoriginal premise, weak plot, poor flow and no real resolution to the conflicts and situations presented. Obviously written by an amateur. The author should keep his day job."
3,Misprinted ad,"There are a few things wrong with the current page. 1). You can buy 1 tube of this caulk @ Home Depot for a couple of bucks. 2). Under ""Product Description"" it says; 3X3X10 , 13.3 Pounds. 3). Under ""Shipping Weight"" it says; 1 Pounds. Is this 1 tube of caulk or a case of caulk? If this is a case, it's a great deal. If it's 1 Tube, it's not."
1,Error in price of this itemj,The price of this should be between 3 and 4 dollars. I think there's an error here.Thanks.
3,Dont believe the list price,I bought this product believing that I had found a treasure. Judging by the list price and shipping weight I thought this might be for a case. However it is for one tube. Oh well. As far as the product...it is silicone.
5,excellent partner,"there was a problem first, because the store keeper changed the ordered material for a similar one.but DBROTH send us the original ordered one free of charge on first class on the next week.i am totally satisfied!"
3,Wish the CD Case wasn't cracked...,"I purchased this Album for my husband who I would consider a ""Die Hard BHTM Fan"" for a present and now I have to go buy a new case for it, so it doesn't look like it was stomped on before I give it to him, because it's notworth the cost of returning for a new one and not getting it in time for his birthday present."
5,More than good fun,"I bought this as a used cd somewhere and didn't play it for a year or so. What a mistake!!! This has turned out to be one of my favorite cds. I play it for dinner parties and for very successful private seductions, I play it when I'm feeling down and when I'm on top of the world. Infectious in the very best way. Lyrical, frisky, beautiful. Riccardo Tesi is a master musician and composer, his banditaliana rocks. An aromatic, creamy, frothy, hot and hot latte of a cd with hints of tabla, jazz, gitano and nutmeg. Yum."
1,Totally incomprehensible,"This book is totally incomprehensible; if you see it on a syllabus drop the course. Its a theoritical analysis of theoritical analyseses of art and history, and its incredibly poorly written. I think. I'm an undergrad a top 10 university, I've spent most of the last two days reading this book and I'm not even sure what its about, much less what he's actually trying to say."
5,You get what you pay for...,This is a nice open face helmet. It feels sturdy and looks sharp. I'm going to pinstripe mine.
5,Barry Manilow,How can you go wrong if you're a Barry Manilow fan or a fan of the fifties music. Great CD.
2,BARRY you did me in on this one. I believed the hype. You can do better.,"WHERE DID THAT TREMOR COME FROM IN YOUR VOICE??These songs sound strained in my opinion. I knew and loved all of these songs. You've taken away some of their appeal. Come on Barry, come up with something better. I have many of your CDs and albums. This one won't get much play. Think I'll go and dig out COPA.By the way, on DANCING WITH THE STARS why did you song COPA so fast?? Sure didn't sound like the old hit...... come on Barry, get back in the groove. I won't give up on you......"
1,"Manilow, Songs of the 50's","The CD would not work on my player. It skipped. I returned itand would like a replacement. Instead, you are sending me arefund. I still want the CD. This seems to be the only wayI can communicate with you. Richard S. Mason, 17807 CorteHuasco, Unit 71, San Diego CA 92128"
2,average,"I dig Barry Manilow's Music ,but this Collection of 50's Covers doesn't do Him any justice. vocally he is alright,but the arrangements&some of the choices don't compliment Him fully.much like the Project Manilow did with Bette Midler on Peggy Lee this seems more like a Formula pattern following that a actual general idea of what would&what wouldn't work.Hit&alot of Miss."
1,He writes the songs that make the whole world hurl,but if you are a old fart lady with no taste in music then this does not apply.
1,"Muzak for Grannies....Don't Bother With Mediocre Covers!! Get the Originals!!,","Trite syrupy arrangements which don't help B.M,at 60,to make it.My Granny will buy it,for sure,she is 85 ! Not for me !Backed by a huge ,very huge media blitz from Arista and the pop music destroyer,C.Davis,expect to see a lot of phony ""great reviews"". Probably the worst album of the decade thus far...."
1,MANILOW SINGS KAROKE......AND BADLY!,I was greatly disappointed in this. I thought the arrangements were mediocre and his singing listless; like he didn't want to strain his voice. Maybe the bad face lift affected his vocal chords. And why dust off 75 year old Phyllis MacGuire to sing a duet! Did he think it would help?
5,Music and Passion,Fantastic album from start to finish in typical Manilow style. Hits all the various emotions in a way that only he can.
5,The Greatest songs of the Fifties,"Listening to this music gave me a chance to relive my youth. I remember dancing to all these songs when I was in high school. Barry Manilow was true to the spirit of the songs, making the sound a wonderful trip down memory lane."
5,The Greatest Songs of the Fifties - Barry Manilow,Everything went fine and I received this item in a timely manner.
5,Man is Manilow Magnificent,"Good for Barry to be back on top. Like the young singer (and fellow Las Vegas Hilton Hotel Headliner) Michael Buble, Manilow knows how to inject himself into the music and make it sweet.Talented beyond words as a song writer and gifted as a singer in his own right Manilow makes marvelous music!! Great buy!!!"
5,A different side of Manilow,"Barry Manilow is more well known for his melodramatic, albeit extremely well done, style of singing from the 70s. Switching gears, he mellows a bit to great effect on this album with its understated orchestration that retains his charmingly Manilow-style phrasing. This delightful collection includes a wonderful, spot-on duet with Phyllis Mcguire. They blend together flawlessly. Highly recommended to put on your turntable for the evening."
4,Well Done CD,I too like many of the reviewers were not born when these songs came out.But given that they have all been played over the years on the radio I'm familiar with them. Barry has done a great job with these songs especially his version of Love is a many splendid thing. A hard song to sing he does an excellent job. My least favorite one was an original Elvis song. Never was an Elvis fan. A Recommended Buy.
4,Not this time,I have been a huge fan of Barry Manilow since the seventies and he is always better singing his own songs than the songs of another artist.
1,"a big ripoff not ""new recordings"" as advertised","marketed as ""new recordings"" these are obvious low fidelity re-recordings of the originals. My original tapes sound better. Your marketing gave us the impression Barry recently sung and recorded his original songs. What a disappointment for his fans.A waste of money for fans who own the any"
4,CD reissue of original album,"This is a CD reissue of an original King album by Moon Mullican. The material is excellent and largely unavailable elsewhere. The main highlights not available on another album are ""So long"", ""1001 sleepless nights"", ""Keep a light in the window for me"" & ""A Crushed red rose"". The material is above the law and shows anyone who isn't aware of the fact that country music in the old days was so diverse and broad.There is only one reason that this album doesn't deserve 5 stars: some of the songs (such as ""Leaving you with a worried mind"", ""Short but sweet"" & ""Well oh well"") are edited and omit much of Moon's piano playing and other playing between the vocal verses. Unfortunately, many of the songs that are cut aren't available on other CDs and you need to look for the hard to find 45s and 78s to get the full versions of the songs."
2,Short Shrift,"You'd have to be a longtime Moon Mullican fan to get much real enjoyment from this CD, which comes with no liner notes of any kind and includes a few clumsy editing jobs.""Jambalaya"" is embarrassingly bad and had me worrying that I'd stumbled across yet another 3rd-rate Hank Williams copy cat. The real Moon Mullican is shown off better on traditional C&W; sides like ""So Long"" and his later Blues influenced stuff like ""I'm Mad With You,"" ""Well Oh Well,"" and the truly rockin' ""Seven Nights To Rock,"" which Bruce Springsteen covered on his 2003 tour."
2,16 and pregnant,The show should have spent more than 1 episode per girl. It gives a brief overview of what it is like to be pregnant at such a young age. It would have been better if each story was not so rushed.
3,Educational,"Found it to be quite frustrating, felt like it took them much time to learn for lessons. I feel like it helps to be viewed."
4,My review,"This is a terrific show on MTV. It teaches a lesson to be careful when they fall in love. They may end up getting pregnant. It is not a disservice, but a valuable lesson to be learned by these teens."
2,Where's His point of View,"From Maci's standpoint ... its a fair portayal. But what about the father's????!!!! I am really upset that this show has the opportunity to really educate young people and all it does is man bash. There is no one telling the young father how to be a dad or anyone for that matter telling Maci how to support the father of her child (not $ support but emotional) she is seen always taking care of Bentley but not encouraging Ryan.With the crisis in our country of fatherless children... MTV you have the opportunity to encourage boys to become men. And i feel like you dropped the ball.At the end I just wanted to have someone take Maci aside and say - Yes its hard for him too, just because you dont see it doesnt mean it doesnt happen and doesnt mean that he doesnt think about the awesome responsibility. And have someone do the same for Ryan."
2,Doormat?,This doormat is incredibly lightweight and moves around when you step on it. I originally bought this for my dog door. The same day I got it and put it in place my dog was able to chew off the corner like it was bread. Now I have it at the door from my garage to the kitchen and I'm still constantly putting it back to where it belongs. Not so good.
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"This is the best book ever written! I also reccomend you to read the two following books, they are just as good!"
4,I liked this toy,"I loved this toy. It was so much fun. I wanted it for christmas but I never got it. Out of reading the other reviews me and my mom thought it was the best. The magnifing glass worked pretty well, not to metion it is a kids toy. The ink really worked. You can really see someones fingerprint. The powder, sometimes works. Its tricky to get it perfect. The tape is hard to pull off, but once you get the hang of it it gets easier. I loved this kit!"
5,"Fun game, but may seem corny to kids older than 7.","I have a 10 and a 7 year old child that absolutely love Steve and Terri Irwin; they seldom miss an episode of ""The Crocodile Hunter"" on Animal Planet. So buying this game should have been a no-brainer in terms of getting something fun for them to play with. Right? Well, sort of...There isn't much challenge to the game, so my 10 year old was quickly turned off to it. Not even the fun-fact cards could sustain her interest in the game.My 7 year old son was another story. The roaming crocodile that pops Steve (or Terri) off the fence gets him every time! Ideally I'd like my son to sit still long enough to absorb the info. on the game cards.All in all...a fun game, but for younger children."
3,Croc Hunter Game,"The kids like the Animal Planet show and love Steve and Terry. The kids wanted this game for Christmas and so I bought it. There is no educational value to this game whatsoever. But the thing I like the least about this game is the fact that once set up it does not fit back into the box. If you want to put it away, you have to go through the troublesome job of dismantling it, which is not a speedy task. Worse yet is the job of putting the fencing back on again the next time in the right configuration. The kids like it though however, right now it is laying upside down on my computer room floor."
1,Could Be Better,I like to watch the Crocodile Hunter on TV but this game wasn't that fun. All you do is pick up a card and move the players around the board. I got this for Christmas and have only played it twice.
3,Not Bluegrass,"This CD was promoted on Amazon as a bluegrass album. While Porter Wagoner is/was a great country/western performer, this CD is as close to bluegrass as I am to rocket science. No disprespect but I'm a carpenter. I've enjoyed and respected Porter's music for over 40 years but this is NOT a bluegrass album as Amazon represented it to be. If you love Porter Wagoner, buy it. If you love bluegrass, don't buy this one."
2,Porter Wagner - Wagonmaster,"I was wishing for more in Porter's last CD. With one exception, I found all the songs blended together."
5,Porter Wagoner-Wagonmaster CD,"The company I bought these from was very prompt in there delivery.I had my products in less than a week.I will give them the best review,because they were prompt and my items were received in great condition."
5,The talent shines through,"While I have never been the biggest Porter Wagoner fan, this is a classic. His talent shows through in most every song. Whether his raw talent, Marty Stewart's ability to produce or my appreciation of ""soulful"" country music, it is a CD that I highly recommend."
3,Good summary of American History,"I find this book very useful and, given the price, I would recomend it.I must say however that I was very disapointed with the fact that this book is mainly focused in the US History, and less focused in Europe's (and the rest of the world) History . Centuries like XIV and XV seem to be lacking important facts.Besides, if you want to find a date of a certain event it is not easy (there is a glossary at the end that can help you with this but it is incomplete).Again, I do not regret buying this book but I think I was expecting something else."
5,Instant info at your fingertips,"This is simply a phenomenal book. It gives most of the important events of history and lays them out in a helpful timeline fashion that allows the reader to get information about what happened in any year in politics, science, music, etc. Simply a must-have for any reference collection."
4,"Great reference tool, but.....","Great book! It really puts history into context in order to better understand the world as a whole. However, I was very dissapointed to see no mention of Australia before Cook ""discovered"" it, or of the Aboriginies living there thousands of years before the prisoners landed from England. Nor was there enough imformaiton about the native populations of the Americas. Furthermore, I think that the last 50 years focus on American culture too much...do we really need to know the superbowl scores? Overall though, this book is a great reference tool and the daily life protion is very entertaining and fun."
2,Difficult to use,"I found this timetable difficult to use. When the description called it encyclopedic they must have been talking about its size and weight. One might find it informative to just thumb thru and see what was happening in different areas of the world at different time. But to use the book to trace a particular development (like ""movable type,"" or ""domesticated dairy animals,"") or to compare progressive periods of history between civilizations (like Central and South America, China, or Egypt) is awkward with lots of bookmarks and notes."
3,Handy Resource. Especially For Researching Writers,"This book is basically what it says. All filled with timetables, it's one huge book that is a chart. It goes throughout history listing the events of the years. Categories include history, politics, literature, theater, religion, philosophy, learning, visual arts, music, science, technology, growth, and daily life. The version available now is newer than mine so it may have more.It's a handy reference guide for wither self interest or research."
5,Crying for an update,"For those of us who want a chronology of history--just the facts, man--clearly showing wars awaging in conjunction with writers writing, musicians making music, daily doings, etc., THIS is the book. Alas, I have the 1991 edition you offer. Time for an update?"
2,Tabular format dooms a valient effort,"The format -- a tabular list of events sorted by year -- is this book's Achilles heel. The depth of information is immense, but the format makes reading it feel more like a chore than a joy. Though I appreciate the chronological presentation (as opposed to a geographically isolated context in which most history is taught), in the end it fails to make up for the dry method of presentation."
2,Selective omissions of North American early European history,"This book has almost no history of early Spanish history that involves ""native"" North American cultures and trading activities. These expeditions and conquests greatly affected the survival and distorts by omission important historical contributions of tribes in New Mexico, Arizona, etc. Furthermore, the ""Indian Wars"" affecting English migrations from the east coast to 1900 were impacted in significant ways from the events centuries earlier involving Spanish conquests and the ""religious conversions"" of the earlier inhabitants. For example, a book that discusses many of these features is ""Cities of Gold"" by Douglas Preston. This book's focus is on Coronado's search for the 7 cities of gold, but integrates considerable detail predating and postdating the particular search."
1,can't see the forest for the trees,"An obsession with detail -breaking down history into thousands and thousands of year by year, mind-numbing columns is NOT the way to study history. It might be useful as a research tool, but then decade by decade columns would have done more good to give the gist of history instead of the minutia. But if minutia is what you're after, a soft-ware version of this book -with MORE minutia and more cross-referencing and MORE big picture essays- would make more sense."
4,well organized,"This is a great book to just sit and flip through. For any historian it's a good way to bone up on years you are fuzzy about. It's not very descriptive, but has some interesting events that might interest you. I wouldn't recommend it as a book to read cover to cover -- more or less, it's a good reference or interesting book for a car ride."
4,Another view,excellent purchase. The topic explains another side of history that many do not know. Thanks.Mr. Silva
3,A nice compendium,However the ideas were nothing I had not seen by subscribing to the Potter Barn Catalog. I understood that when I made the purchase but I had hoped for some original content. It makes for a nice diversion though if it is sitting on the coffee table and I am bored!
2,Look elsewhere for inspiration,"I have read/used three of the Pottery Barn books listed in order of my opinion of them: Baths, Living Rooms, and Bedrooms. Baths was very good, with beautiful photographs, interesting and innovative ideas, and some useful design advice. Most of the book provided a several page showcase for an individual bath with discussion of what made it special.Living rooms was OK. It's content was more canned, but it still had some inspiration and enough ideas that were useful that although I would not put it amongst the best such books, it was worth an hour or two to browse.Bedrooms hit the bottom of the list for me. The content seemed especially canned. The ideas were not fully developed and most of them appeared to me more appropriate to someone's first apartment than an established home (so it just needs the right audience?). Lot's of the pictures involved just using eclectic pieces and did not involve actually developing a decorative theme."
2,Dated and Boring,"I purchased the book because I thought that anything Fine Gardening put out would be superb. I thought wrong-as a landscaper I'm looking for new and different ideas, Fine Gardenings trademark. If the content wasn't great I thought I could always use the photo's to show clients for ideas- wrong again. The photos are dark and dreary. Again I should have paid more attention to the copy right date."
3,Worth Reading,"This is the first book I've read on the subject of gardening or design, and I'm glad I bought it. As a novice, I'm now going to buy additional books featuring more plans and how-to's of building walk-ways, walls and other hands-on aspects, but this book explained the basics to me of what is important in a garden and what makes gardens pleasing to the eye. It's got a broad range of topics, and there were a few pieces inside that were really useful. I found some stuff relevant to my style for north-east, but there's also information for California-type gardens and open spaces, i.e., if you have several acres. Very inspirational and great for ideas. It starts with site lay-out and the importance of drawing or making a plan and builds from there. It's a series of articles, all well-written."
4,Pilot to bombardier...,"Loud, good fun. Sure, it's a little low on subtlety, but there's tons to like -- ""3-D"" and ""Nervous Man Nervous"" especially stand out -- as Big Jay stomps his way through this record. This swings the way few things swing anymore; put away that Big Bad Doo Doo Patty record and listen to this instead."
5,Savushun is the best iranain novel,"Dr.s.Danehsvar is a well-educated Iranian writer.She has written so many interesting stories but Savushun is the best.It is published before revalution but sill is well accepted by the Iranian readers.She is from Shiraz , city of great Iranian poets such as hafez.This story described the iranian culture in Shiraz during world ward2.It is suggested to all book lovers and book worms!! Mohammad h.,IRAN"
5,Only 3 reviews for this? No way!,"I majored in English Teaching and had the pleasure of being assigned this book in college. It is not the most artistic book I've ever read, and there are no fancy structural techniques used like there are in The English Patient, for example. This book has a much different appeal. Few novels have ever grabbed hold of my emotions like this one. I remember, at one point, throwing the book on the ground and not being able to read anymore until I'd done some menial chore to quell my rage. This book forces you to feel. Very well done."
5,A necessity in every woman's library.,"I find it ""interesting"" that there has to be a book tellingus that our doctors aren't telling us all of the options. I sufferedfrom all of those perimenopausal symptoms - just ask my family! Itried progesterone and got so depressed I couldn't function in day today life. Upon discovering this book, I sought out the alternattivesfrom my favorite vitamin and herbal site,...and decided to tryblack cohosh, red clover and wild yam gel. I'm back to the good oleme - just ask my family! I'm not growing hair in weird places, my sexdrive is back, my skin tone is better...We are in the new milleniumand it is time we all owned this book..."
5,Very Helpful,"I was having night sweats and did not want to get medication from a doctor. I wanted to do something that was natural and not harmful to my body. I highly recommend this book, because I did what it said and got the serum from the health food store and it completely stopped the night sweats. You can purchase it in a cream or serum formula. I rub it on my skin once a day and you would not believe the change. I highly recommend this book. It gives a lot of information on Menopause and what you can do naturally for the symptoms. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!"
5,Attn: Women-This Book Could Save Your Life!!!,"Thank you Dr.Lee for this very informative book!It really opened my eyes big time on the subject of treating menopause. I hope every woman,concerned about her health,will read this book."
1,Learned the *very* hard way - Please Be Careful!,"Dr. Lee's book convinced me to try natural progesterone, and it was one of the worst decisions ever. After only one month of use, I developed blood clots in my legs, and became so ill that it has taken over six months to recover. Progesterone cream builds up in your tissues over time and can make you very, very sick. Do not believe it when you read that there are no side effects and it is impossible to overdose. Know that the progesterone you're putting on your skin, although ""natural"", is capable of having all the same effects as the progesterone in birth control pills and RU-486 ~ in other words, you're using something with serious dangers connected to it. Please, please be careful. Get Barbara Seaman or Ellen Grant, MD's books for better information."
5,This book will answer your questions!,"This is one of the most informative books I've ever read. It made me realize that even my own doctor is not as up-to-speed on women's health issues as he could be and probably relies upon pharmaceutical company marketing literature to prescribe courses of treatment for his patients. This book empowers women to understand and make informed decisions about their health during a life-change cycle that can be a confusing and uncomfortable time for many. It is a comprehensive guide to understanding the complexities of female physiology as well as how we can help keep ourselves healthy. Dr. Lee has written a great book in ""normal"" language that is easy to understand and a must-read for all women."
5,DOWN AND OUT - READ THIS BOOK,"You will learn what you need to know about hormones and how important they are to your overall health and HAPPINESS. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE YOURSELF AND HOW YOU FEEL. READ THIS. Follow the recommendations and believe me, IT WILL GIVE YOU HOPE AGAIN. Thanks so much Dr. Lee."
5,Very good book,The seller responded immediately. I received the book promply and in excellent condition. The book is extremely helpful. I've adhered to one of the major recommendations in it and it solved my problem. A small price to pay for good health and valuable information.
2,Is this book still filled with good advice?,"The recently stopped study of the effects of estrogen and progesterone (showing an increase in heart attacks, strokes, dementia and cancers) leaves me wondering whether or not the advice in this book is still sound. Estrogen alone did not show the increased risks leaving us to conclude progesterone was the culprit. These results were unknown when Dr. Lee wrote this book, but now I am wondering whether or not it should be mandatory for Dr. Lee to address these concerns before women start using this progesterone cream he advocates."
1,not recommended for medical menopause @ 38 yrs,The book does a good job of explaing options for women of natural menopause age. The part that concerned me was comparing a woman having a hysterectomy with a man being castrated. Being a woman doesn't only have to do with her internal organs it also has to do with her mind and heart. This was a one liner in the book but it was the line that I remembered. I may have taken it out of context at the time but still the comment stays with me. Other than that the authors offered many alternatives to synthetic medications and did a good job of describing those alternatives. I may give it a try after surgery.
4,Breakthrough news on hormone replacement therapy. Read it!!,"Dr. John Lee has miraculously brought forth the hidden secrets of using natural progesterone cream for hormone replacement therapy. This book is a must read for all women who have had a hysterectomy, premature menopause or are in perimenopause, or natural menopause. This book should also be read by all physicians specializing in women's reproductive disorders. Unopposed estrogen can produce problems for some women. Dr. John Lee gives women who are suffering through the side effects of estrogen replacement therapy another road to follow in relief of menopausal symptoms."
5,Should be mandatory reading for every woman over 40,"This book changed my life. When my doctor took away my prempro, I was miserable. Hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, frequent heartburn, depression, lack of energy, all were making life less than good. After reading the book and using the progesterone cream as directed, I was a new woman. Thank you, Dr. Mary Glass for recommending it and thank you, Dr. Lee for the most helpful book I've ever read (and I've read a lot!)."
3,Clarifies some things.,"This book clarifies some things about menopause, and may behelpful. It had more information than I needed, and wasn'tinteresting enough for me to finish reading."
1,Biased and sensational,"One-sided, biased, sensational advice. Guilt-inducing diatribes (hysterectomy is necessary only in the presence of a malignancy? HARDLY). Be certain that this is not your only reference for menopause. Incomplete nutrition advice (""eat more fish!""); angry proselytizing about the beef industry; limited/incomplete vitamin information. You will be much better served by seeking unbiased representation and making informed decisions."
1,Be careful,"Dr. Lee is not an OB/Gyn. be careful when reading this book. Recend clinical studies are not included in this book.Furthermore, Dr. Lee is widely disregarded by his peers."
5,An essential remedy for my hysterectomy,"I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in its early stage in Feb,97. My doctor performed the radial hysterectomy. He told me I cannot take estrogen but thinks natural progesterone is harmless. However he only checks that the surgical incisions heal ok, but made no suggestions for life after surgery. Reading about natural progesterone in this book and taking the progesterone cream is a life-saver for me. It pays for us patients to be informed and take charge of our health."
5,This one is a MUST READ for both Men and Women!,"I wish that Dr. Lee had used the word HORMONES instead of MENOPAUSE in his title so that younger women might be more encouraged to read it. This book has helped me tremendously. I have read other titles about menopause and tried therapies suggested by other authors/physicians, but none have hit thte mark like this book. I only wish that it had been available before I had what I believe to be several unnecessary surgeries. I use natural progesterone cream now myself and point everyone I meet to this book. I even smear it on my husband because I STRONGLY feel that low progesterone levels effect men as well as womenf and progesterone therapy will help prevent prostate problems as well. This book is the most borrowed book on my bookshelf."
2,Hesitant to recommend,"I have worked in the health food and the medical fields. I have seen the ""miracle cure alls"" come and go. This book seems to say that using Progesterone is a super cure to all womanly woes. Having had womanly woes, I tried using progesterone for my endometriosis. It was not a cure-all. I'm sure that it helps some women, but be wary of putting all your faith in it."
5,Every Woman Should Read This Book!,"This book changed my life! After 2 years of synthetic HRT hell, I followed Dr. Lee's advice and had immediate results, with NO side effects. Thank you, Dr. Lee. Every women should read this book and stop taking estrogen and the synthetic hormones that physicians are precribing."
4,wonderful book,This is a legend book for the connaisseurs of coffee. Is a fortune this edition. I am an economist and researcher and I have used this book in my writings. I recommended it for people interesed in coffee
4,Coffee Coffee,This book has provided a complete history of coffee up to the early 1900's. It reviews the origins and how coffee came to be grown in the various countrys spread thouhgout the world today. The countrys and/or areas are named as they were pre-world war 1.
1,Do not buy this!,"I purchased this book and received the worst looking piece of publishing that I have ever seen.The book is coffee table sized. Inside, printed on photocopy paper in the centre of each page was a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOCOPY in the size of a trade paperback, sitting with broad margins. The index was further photo-reduced, printed two pages to a page and printed and bound in landscape.This cannot be an honest mistake.And then I was quoted $60 shipping to return the book.Avoid this book and every other book by the same printers at all costs.NOTE: I gave this one star because Amazon's system doesn't allow for NO STARS or less. THUMBS DOWN!"
3,"Good surge protector, but poor line noise filtering","I bought 2 sets of Cyber Power 1090 surge protector because I had great experience with its UPS 800AVR units.However, whenever I print anything on my Cannon MP830, my screen would wobble by very tiny amount. Its barely detectable but is definitely present. My 5-year old APC surge protector PER7 did not exhibit this problem.This is not the same high quality build as CyberPower's UPS. If you want UPS I recommend CyberPower. If you want good surge protector with good line noise filtering then go with APC."
5,"Good quality, inclues all the cables.","I brought this power outlet after reviewing several brands including Belkin, Monster, etc. This one is the most value for the buck, and to my surprise, it also comes with all the cables needed for your total protection. It includes a network cable, a telephone cable, and a tv signal cable, which are very welcome."
4,Replacement wiper arm,"Good figment, OEM style wiper arm, a definite must have to replace old worn arms on you YJ Jeep. Fast shipping to your door, no wait for auto parts store to order."
4,"Very comfortable, but fade fast with washing","I prefer overall style jeans to belted jeans, because the latter seem to have a waistband that's determined to cut me in half! I just wish overalls would come back into style for both men & women because I think they look great also. Despite being out of style, I've found that I can wear overalls to almost any occasion where regular jeans are acceptable, and I even wear them to the office on casual days. I've found the Carhartts to be exceptionally comfortable and I now spend most of my time in them. The only problem is that, like many blue denim products, they tend to die quickly with washing. So I'm inclined to wash them far less frequently than I should. Unlike many folks, I tend to like new-looking darkish denim, and that look is pretty much gone after the first wash. Other than this wear issue, I can happily recommend them."
2,Sizing,The sizing is way off and I am trying to return them but can't find the billing. There was nothing in this box.
4,Carhartt,"Quality name.Comfortable to wearHave wanted to purchase for awhile, but local department stores wanted to much for them"
3,Too pricey for the quality of the material.,"Disappointed in the weight and texture of the material. Was expecting something more heavy-duty / durable, especially for the price. Would not buy this product again."
5,Great overalls,"I purchased these to replace my old totally comfortable but falling apart pair. They fit me very well although I am female. I am of average build; 5'-5"", size 8 and a 34D. I like the feel of the washed denim and the hooks on the bib seem to be of a stronger design than my old pair and should hold up better. I look forward to many good years of comfortably working in these."
3,"Carhartt Men's Washed Denim Bib Overall, Darkstone, 44x28","these pants run WAY small , should have heeded the reviews... also i think dickies and carhart are made buy the same Mexican companies... thought Carhart meant ""Made in the US"" ...... NOT....!!!!!!!!!! just as thin as dickies brand...."
1,Defective Disc,"My daughter absolutely LOVES her InteracTV system. For some reason, though, this disc has never worked right. When she gets to the second card, the video gets caught in a loop and never advances. We returned the disc to the store for a new one. The new Barney did the same exact thing! None of her other discs (Sesame Street, Blues Clues, Dora the Explorer...) ever had this problem. On the up side, though, I called Fisher Price and they're going to send us a voucher for the retail value to be used on a new disc. Maybe we'll try Clifford this time..."
2,Not what I wanted.,The wheel doesn't roll over the fabric well. You have to press down hard to grip the fabric and can damage it. I like the concept but its not a good marker for anything unless you marking something like wood.
5,Rack Sack Bags,I couldn't find them in stores so was very happy when I could get all the replacements I wanted and needed.
1,Rack Sacks,"I am REALLY disappointed in the new Rack Sack design. They don't stay on well, the ""handles"" make it worse. I wish I could get the old kind of 3 gallon sacks."
2,I know things are always changing but ...,"... why is it that they seldom change for the better? I am reading the other reviews, most of them bemoaning the fact that Rack Sack changed from rolls to single bags and that they decided to use a scent that would make skunks jealous.I plowed ahead anyway and bought the ""New - Improved"" version and now, guess what? It looks like they've discontinued this model too!So what gives Rack Sack? Do we revert to brown paper bags again like when I was a kid in the 60s? Oh yeah, I forgot, they don't make brown paper bags in quantity anymore.The Publix supermarkets here in Florida are now selling some other brand and, of course, the bags aren't interchangeable.What a surprise."
1,Disappointing,The original rack sack bags that were on a roll are much more convenient. I think this product has been ruined.
5,Rack Sack refill bags by Extrufix,Excellent product. Fits my rack sack holder and has good tab hooks. Would definitely buy this product again.
3,good deal,Very handy and convenient. does the job. Everything was up to par. Would buy it again. economical way to buy
1,Bought by Mistake!!!!!!,Bought by mistake! Go for the roll. They are perfumed to death and because they are not on a roll are a pain to store.
5,fits my older rack sack fine,"Got original sack rack from Bed, bath, beyond but they no longer carry refills. These fit just great and smell good too."
5,Works for me!,"Have been using the bags for years. Having a small, compact kitchen we don't like having an unsightly garbage can around. The bags allow us to hide the trash under the sink. They are not cheap, but we like them."
4,Rack Sack System is the Best!,"We have been using the 3 gallon Rack Sack System under our kitchen sink for the last 20 years. I don't know what I would do without it! Started out with the rolls loved it for the connivance and I must admit I was disappointed when they changed to the box, however I love the tie handles locking in place. The bags no longer slide off when they get full. My one and only complaint.... I hate the scented bags! Garbage smells better. The ""New Fresh Scent"" smells just like a chemical toilet! Who needs the stench? Get rid of the smell and you've got a product."
5,Rack Sack Refill Garbage Bags,"Rack Sack Bag refillsSuch a great way to have the garbage out of the way. I cannot find these refills so I am pleased that Amazon has them. This is my third order.These bags are strong, never break and there is a very pleasant odor when you put them in the frame.Thanks AmazonEvy in Phx."
4,Rack Sack Bags,These are great bags. We have been using them for at least 3 years and find them to be compact and very handy. Their strength makes them ideal for handling household garbage. We highly recommend them.
1,If 0 Stars were a choice I would have selected that,"I am soooo disappointed that they discontinued the Rack Sack Roll Refills. I bought a whole bunch online 3 years ago when they weren't available at Bed Bath & Beyond. Now they aren't available AT ALL so when this last bag I have runs out I'll have to get a new system. Or maybe I'll figure out how to manufacture the rolls - I think it would do well. It seems to me they have a lot of unhappy former customers because they changed something that worked so well. I liked the review that wondered whether the company was now run by the Taliban or Al-Queda, I might add to the list of possibilities, our current government.IT""S REALLY TOO BAD - the whole system has been undermined."
3,100 Rack Sack Refill Bags,"The Rack Sack garbage system is great. However, about two years ago they changed the way the bags are dispensed: from a continuous roll stored in the rack to individual bags pulled from a container stored somewhere else. Not nearly as convenient as the original product!"
1,gave up and finally replaced my rack sack,"I have been struggling for years with the larger, folded replacement bags falling out and getting caught in the door. I tried other manufacturer's bags and nothing worked like the original 3 gallon roll bags. I used to love the rack sack until they quit offering the small bags. Now I replaced it with an equivalent item from IKEA. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a convenient under sink door mounted trash."
4,rack sack,I always buy these on amazon they are hard to find in a store. I love rack sack it keeps my bad dog out of trash.
3,Not so hot,Packaging difficult to open. Bags slide on each other and fall out of top of rack sack. Old design and roll of bags much easier to deal with.
4,Rack Sack bag review,The bags are fine. They come in 4 packs of 25 inside the box. I've been using them a number of years.
4,Rain guage,Haven't used it .. Don't like to put it out when it's freezing.. This is my second guage and love the first.. Recomend it for those who like to know how much rain they had along with current temp..
4,Great optic,"Set up was easy and seems accurate. The battery is somewhat difficult to install,since you must remove screws to install."
3,Needs Back-Light or Larger Display,This is a nice product and so far I like with the above exception. In low light conditions you have to walk up to it to see it. It either needs a back-light or larger display. Also it needs the option of a plug in so you don't go through a gazillion batteries!
4,It rained again dear...,"A great way to keep track of rainfall and the current temperature without having to go outside or even open the drapes.Heavy duty packaging... I mean tough to get open, a real pain actually.Instructions are not the easiest either. Not horrible but sometimes confusing to me.Note that it takes a while for the wireless connection to be made. Not sure why it takes so long.and make sure you place the rain gauge in a place it won't get knocked over. Dang dogs!Once it is setup that is it... I like the total rain to date feature which can be reset at your convienence but another feature that is a bit tricky but not nearly as bad as getting it out of the packaging.Best wishesDave"
5,Great product!,"Received this rain gauge as a Christmas present to replace the small tube variety. What a step up! Product works great -- display for daily rainfall, cumulative annual rainfall, indoor/outdoor temperatures. Easy to install. Definitely recommend this product."
3,Oegon Scientific RGR 126 Rain Gauge,"The rain gauge itself worked very well and was acurate, but the outside temperature sensor never did work."
1,Not too good!,We received this product as a Christmas gift. Setup went well and it worked fine UNTIL IT RAINED. We now have determined that the rain gauge works fine UNTIL IT RAINS then we lose the wireless connection. It can easily be reestablished and it will continue to work UNTIL IT RAINS again. I can see from other posts that contacting customer service would be an exercise in futility.
3,Not quite as advertised,"The rain gauge/outdoor thermometer work OK (finally). It definitely does not have the range that is advertised. In fact it probably only has a 50-75 foot range rather than the 300 they say it has. It was a little difficult to set up also. Also, there is a 2-3 degree difference temperature-wise from our other wireless temperature gauge."
1,What a dissappointment,I ordered the rain gauge as a gift for my husband and it would not work no matter how he tried to set it up. He followed the directions with no luck.
3,ddisappointed,old style is the most reliable. This was an extreme disappointment to me given the range it was to broadcast. Accuracy leaves much to be desired.
5,Very Satisfied,"I'm sorry to read the negative reviews on this item. I bought mine (via Amazon) before Xmas and even though we haven't gotten much rain it works flawlessly. I tucked the temp sensor outside the front door (in the shade) and the rain bucket outside my office and I always have a signal/reading. The temp sensor has to send the signal through several walls (or somehow around the house) and always sends the signal.It was a little tricky at first because I had other Oregon Scientific monitors and needed to set the new gauge so it was separate and didn't duplicate readings.Also, I agree the number of tiny screws is a pain the butt. Only having to change them once or twice a year is well worth the inconvenience.I'm tempted to buy more for friends, but with the negative reviews I'm not so certain I will.Pete"
4,great way to stay dry,"This is the 3rd one we buy. The first one was left behind when we moved. We had it for over 10 years. Then we bought the 2nd one and had it now for about 3 years. The outside rain collecting unit got destroyed with flying debris from a tornado that wiped out our barn with all the tools, etc. So now we just bought and installed our 3rd one. When you live on a farm and it rains, you are always wanting to immediately know how much it has rained, now you don't have to get wet and go outside to see. You just walk up near the window, where you have the inside unit. The only downside is, if there are lots of trees, you need to make sure the outside unit doesn't collect leaves or other debris. The little screen can fly out with a strong wind, so I tied it loosely to the fence post. At least I can find it again."
2,"When they are good, they are very very good but when they go bad, they're horrid!!","I have purchased three of these units. When they work, they are WONDERFIUL. Problem is, they don't work well for long. My first unit worked beautifully for almost a year. I didn't hesitate replacing it with another unit. This one, however, only worked for about 3 months. I didn't have my purchase receipt for warranty repair so I bought yet one more. This time, the unit NEVER worked properly. Each time the unit failed (including the one I just received from Amazon), it was due to the rain guage losing contact with the main unit. Changing batteries, resetting, etc. etc. was to no avail (and VERY annoying because of all the silly little screws). I returned the last unit and will NOT purchase another Oregon Scientific wireless rain guage unless they explicitly address the loss of contact issue."
3,Is it Raining?,"This system set up easily to monitor the temperature, but is a bear to get to register the rainfall. I have as yet to get it to register the rainfall amounts and I have set it up just as asked in the instructions. I guess I'll have to call customer support to troubleshoot, it has only 35 feet to send a signal to the main system monitor.Would recommend it to others if it wasn't such a problem to get it to register the rainfall."
3,good function - poor design,"I have had an older unit for years.....worked great. When I bought this new replacement I upgraded to add the outdoor temp sensor. Over all these things work great but I would like to point out two problems.1. If you change batteries or reset the main unit you need to power the other two devices down (remove batteries) first and then restart in the proper order of rain gauge THEN outdoor temp sensor.2. To pull the batteries on the outdoor temp sensor some engineer came up with two deeply recessed very small Phillips head screws. 98% of the population won't have a screw drive that will do the job. One is NOT included with the kit. So off you go to the hardware store to buy a driver.....why is this not obvious to the design staff.So in closing, the unit works great, Get the fanciest long lasting batteries you can buy because getting to the batteries and do the set up from scratch is a pain IMO."
3,It's raining right now,"It's raining right now. Has been for about 20 minutes. What's my rain gauge say? 0.00""After using this product for a few months, I'm just not impressed. It does fairly well measuring ""gushers"" or rain above .5 inches. But for small amounts - really anything under two-tenths - it's completely useless. Also, it has a tendency to record .04"" (.04 seems to be its minimum unit of measure - rain is always recorded at .04, then .08, then .12, etc.) of rainfall a few times a week when no moisture has fallen whatsoever. Overall, the temperature readings work very well and seem to be accurate. And your options for affordable wireless rain gauges is severely limited. But this product just isn't useful for anything more than an entertainment-only novelty item."
3,weak signal,"Seem to work OK, but don't believe the manual when it says that the signal is good up to 300 feet. My base unit can aquire a signal at 150 feet, but cannot maintain it. I changed batteries in both units, and moved the base from one spot to another in the house, but it would always lose the signal after a little while. I finally moved the collector closer to the house, and it is working OK now."
1,This gauge drizzled,"I had faith in the Oregon Scientific name. No longer. Installing batteries was horribly awkward. With the outside temperature sensor sitting right next to the base unit, they read different temperatures - neither correct. Setting inital values was extremely awkward and not at all intrinsic. My unit shipped from ANTOnline who stonewalled me for over a week while I attempted to arrange a return for credit. Amazon should avoid ever working with ANTOnline and having them dirty the good Amazon reputation! I will buy an old fashioned glass tube rain gauge."
1,Thanks for the feedback,"I was contemplating purchase of this unit, but after reading the problems experienced by those who did purchase, I will not purchase any Oregon Scientific product. I""m sorry those of you who did purchase have not had good success with the product, but you have been a success about warning those of us who were about to go through the same situation. Amazon needs to pull these articles from their ""shelf""."
4,Great Product,"I like this rain gauge/thermometer alot. I think just about everyone in my family has one of these, my daughter is on her second one. The only additional feature I wish it had was the ability to look at the history of temperatures. When I get up in the morning I like to check and see what the lowest temp was during the night, or check in the evening to see what the highest temp was during the day. On my last indoor/outdoor themometer it had this feature and I miss it. Overall it is a great product."
2,Inaccurate rain gauge,"The Oregon Scientific RGR126 seems to be solid and well-made. Unfortunately, it does not accurately record rainfall. I have gone through two of these now and checked each against a known accurate manual rain gauge; both units significantly under-report the rainfall. To make matters worse the manual calibration feature that this model used to have has been removed, presumably to save money, so there is nothing that can be done about it. I would not buy it again or recommend it."
1,dlzl,This item does not calculate correctly. The rain gauge would just go to .04 and the temperature was not near correct. Would not recommend it.
5,So far it is GREAT,"I have had this rain gauge for less than a month, but it works great so far. I have a regular rain gauge right next to it and through 3 storms it has been within 0.05"" of the old school rain gauge. Hopefully it keeps working like this for a long time. The design must be changed a bit as there are only 2 screws in the rain gauge to take out to change the batteries, other reviews stated there were way many tiny screws."
3,Not real accurate,"We received this as a gift. If the rain is a gentle rain, the gauge is great but if the rain comes down hard in a thunderstorm or if there is any wind associated with the rain, the gauge doesn't measure accurately at all. It has been off by an inch during some big storms this summer. We have a ""regular"" gauge right beside this one and the old-fashioned one is much more accurate in heavy rain. It's a fun ""toy"" and is nice since you can view the rain history, but not something that you can depend on for accuracy. Also, this gauge resets itself every 24 hrs so if you have rain overnight, it will reset at midnight so you have to look at the history if you've had an all-night rain."
1,Very disappointed,"I gave this to my husband as a Christmas present. Setup was pretty easy, but we have been more than disappointed. It pretty much doesn't measure the rain at all, especially when it rains hard. I would not recommend this unit to anyone.By the way, I gave it one star; but would not give it a star at all."
1,Useless Rain Gauge,"This Oregon Scientific rain gauge has calibrations that are too crude for my needs. It only records in 1/10 inch for the first 1/2 inch. After that the smallest calibration is 1"" increments. I need to be able to tell the difference between 1.0"" and 1.9"". This gauge will not do that. I am going back to an analog gauge."
2,"Not too impressed, so far!",Followed the set up instructions before permanently mounting rain gauge outside. All seemed well. Fabricated a level mount outside several weeks later and found that base station could no longer acquire signal from the gauge. Went through the battery change/reset ritual that tech support recommended. No change. No signal. Tech support issued RMA with a two to three week turn-around estimate. Oregon Scientific tech support not a value-added service.
4,solving the rain gauge lost signal,"I have owned the RGR126 unit for 3 years. the first unit went bad during the warranty period. The customer service people gave me all their fixes to try but the display could not find the rain gauge. They sent me a new unit and it worked fine until the low battery indicator came on for the rain gauge. I replaced the batteries but the display unit could not receive the signal from the rain gauge. I called OS customer service and went through all of their phone fixes but nothing worked. This unit was out of warranty so I took the rain gauge down to see if I could find the problem. It was simple! There is a reset under the battery cover top left side, a small hole that takes a bent paper clip to reset. One push and everything was ok. I don't know why Oregon Scientfic customer service doesn't know about this magic button. Hope this helps someone. This unit has been accurate and has allowed me to keep rain records for the last 3 years. Easy to use."
2,"Difficult to Maintain, Unreliable","I had one of these units for 2 years. The comments about replacing the batteries are right on. Why must it be so difficult? Generally the unit gave reasonable readings, however very small amounts of rain did not record. But when one considers the tilting pan mechanism for measuring rainfall, this (at least to me) is not surprising. A small amount of rain does not trip the pan, and may evaporate before the next rainfall.During the time I owned the unit, the display would periodically start to flash, for no apparent reason. This could go on for days, then stop. I'd replace the batteries (as mentioned earlier, a big pain), but it would not solve the problem. I tried re-setting the unit. It did not help. I tried calling Customer Service. They were of no help. They claimed they never heard of a problem like this. So this spring, rather than waster money on a new set of batteries, I threw it away. I would not buy another one."
1,Defective right out of the box,This item was defective right out of the box. Rain gauge counter cannot be reset to zero - at least not be using the procedure outlined in the user instructions.
1,Didn't last long,"Lasted only three months. Went through all the trouble shooting procedures but nothing. Inside display works fine but will not acquire a signal from the gauge. I have four weather station products, two LaCross, one Ambient, and this from Oregon. I think I'll replace this with a more trusted brand."
1,OK if you only need it to work a few months,"Outside temp reading sporadic at best. Rain sensor failed. Battery replacement difficult if not impossible. Collects typical insect debris causing possible failure. Cleaned outside unit, replaced batteries everywhere, does not work...Not worth the trouble dealing with a replacement after reading some of the other reviews."
1,Worthless rain gauge,"Very difficult to put together due to the number of very small screws and very difficult to get a level rain receptable. I tried to use this product for a year and found out that it just didn't perform as the description indicated. I even installed a post in the garden to receive the rain gauge receptable. I ended up trashing the product. If you want a rain gauge, I suggest you install a simple, non techinal rain gauge."
4,Nice rain gauge,I think this is a quality rain gauge. I have been using it and it predecessor for 10 years and I recommendit. It does require a setup but that's common place in our electronic age.James CArkansas
4,Rain Gauge,"Worked great out of box. Easy to setup. Controls easy to figure out. However, there are too many screws to access the battery.... The system to level the gauge is useless. Use a household level. It is much easier and more accurate."
5,Rain Gauge,The Oregon Wireless Rain Gauge was no problem setting up and installing the batteries that came with it. I checked the rain measuring accuracy with an old sight glass tube gauge and they were both in agreement. I like the dual feature of daily measurement as well as cumulative rainfall.
3,slow,"Rain guage was reasonably easy to set up although the levelling process is a bit bizarre. It would have been easier to level the platform with a real level rather than trying to get four little drops of water to behave in the internal levelling system. The rain guage is quite slow to respond to rainfall. I repeatedly have to ""search"" before I get a result on the readout even though in the middle of a monsoon downpour. I also cannot get the temperature monitor to consistently read unless it is next to the readout. I already have an outdoor temperature monitor so it's not that big a deal for me even though I would like to monitor another location. All the reviews I read before this purchase cited RGR as about the best. I would have preferred spending a little more for something better but it's not bad enough to return."
4,Remote Rain Gauge makes tracking daily rain easy!,"This device helps us record the daily rainfall on our farm. The ten day memory is useful, although the previous model also recorded indoor temperature, and kept track of highs and lows. I miss this feature on the new model. Also missing is a convenient time/day/date display. (Instead, there is an outdoor temperature sensor which is useless for us.)My one negative on the unit is how difficult it is to replace the batteries in the remote device. Be sure to locate the sensor ""can"" in a place you can easily access the unit, as there are 4 small screws and a delicate gasket that must be reinstalled when replacing the batteries."
2,oregon weather rain gauage,Firist one that we received the rain gauage and outside temperature never worked. Now we have the second one and the outside temperature does not work on it also. We purchased because my husband has had one for 3 years and it quit working and he really missed having it. Not a happy camper!!!
4,Working Fine So Far,"After about a month in service it's working fine. Readings all seem to be correct. Yes, as others have mentioned, you need to deal with a number of small screws to change the batteries, but that's not a major issue. My other Oregon Scientific device, a thermometer/hygrometer has them too, and the reason seems obvious as the outside units have to be sealed.Setup was easier than I'd experienced with the unit it replaced (finally died after seven years) from another manufacturer. I just hope it holds up over the long-term.Instructions seemed clear too, including the locations of the ""reset"" buttons."
2,Raingauge/thermometer does not operate as advertised`,Rain gauge appears to operate properly. Outside temperature does not display. Owners manual/instructions are terrible; lacking in any details.
2,Worked less than a year,"When this unit worked it was great. However, it only lasted for 10 months and stopped working. Kind of a high price for something to last less than a year."
2,Oregon Scientific Rain Gauge,"Unfortunately, we received one that gave the inside and outside temperature but would not register the rain fall. We were able to get a refund with no problem. Decided to try and find one locally."
5,replacement rain gauge,"I had purchased an identical weather station from my local home improvement store 5 years ago. When the rain gauge stopped working, I immediately wanted to replace it. I looked at other models, but had gotten such good service from this one that I decided to get the same one again. After I set it up, I compared the rain total with the measurement in a good standard rain gauge-same reading for both. Very accurate. Very easy to set up. Very durable. Guarenteed 1 year, lasted 5!"
2,Worked great for awhile,"I had this unit for almost 2 years. It worked wonderful, giving accurate readings. I noticed that it is calibrated for metric units and converts it to inches (therefore it measures in .04 inch increments), but that's not an issue. Two weeks ago the rain gauge stopped communicating with the receiver. I tried replacing batteries, resetting both the rain gauge and receiver, moved them next to each other, all with no success in getting a reading. I wrote to Oregon Scientific and have not heard back from them. It's a convenient piece of equipment when it was working, but now I think I'll look for another brand."
3,Cannot change radio frequency,"My neighbor has this same remote rain guage (five star), but was surprised that there was no way to use mine because it picked up the neighbor's during 'set up'. I had to return it with no problem or cost on my part to 'Amazon'. Still need one. Thanks, Lee"
5,Rain Gauge and thermometer,Mounted unit next to one I bought ten years ago and works the same as my last one and is much simpler to change the battries in the outdoor in the outdoor unit.
2,Great...for a few months,"Worked great for a few months, then the rain guage slowly quit connecting with the base...constantly had to push the search button. I'm not sure why we even still have the thing other than I hate throwing that much money in the trash. The outside temp guage did not last long in the outdoors weather. It quit working all together after about 5 months. The rain guage ONLY works now when pushing the search button. I'll be buying a new one for Christmas for my husband, but not from this company!"
2,disapointing,"I had bought this with the anticipation that i wont have to worry about going out and dumping the old tube-shaped rainguage, but have something that was suppose to be accurate to see in the comfort of my own home. Well it doesnt work and OS really wasnt any help either. If you want to know the temp, well indoors & out it works great...accurate temp readings. If you want to know the rainfall buy a $2 rain-tube guage from your local dollar store."
5,favorite of all the coconut waters,"Zico Pure Coconut Water, Natural Flavor, 11-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)This coconut water is fantastic. Zico is absolutely the best!"
3,Vita coco coconut water is much better,"As an South Indian, I love drinking coconut water esp. on road trip when your body temperature is high. Vita Coco is certainly much better than Zico Pure Coconut Water. I ordered both and I drank Zico yesterday and I couldn't get any taste initially. Slowly I felt like drinking a coconut water later eventhough the real coconut water taste is kind of missing. The taste was just okay. When I was expecting a similar taste on Vita coco, I wasn't disappointed as yesterday. Vita coco is certainly had much better taste and felt like drinking coconut water. I don't care about anything else but just the taste!!!"
2,"Great when fresh, these ones weren't","In my experience, these drinks taste great when they're fresh. I ordered 2 boxes from Amazon, however, and both were closing in on their 'best before' dates. They tasted stale, and I'm reluctant to buy more until I'm reassured that they'll be fresh."
4,T-333 Universal Battery Checker,"I have only had the item for 1 day, but it appears to do all that it purports to do. I would like to compliment the vender--Battery Superstore All-Battery--for their customer relations. I never received my original order, despite the USPS showing it had been delivered. The Battery Superstore All-Battery resent my order which I received in a timely manner.I respect and appreciate the venders attention to my complaint.Howard"
4,Battery tester,"It seems fairly well constructed and to get it to work, I have to jiggle the battery around until I get a reading. It is shipped with the battery that powers the device. It checks AAA to D size batteries as well as 9 volt, and small round flat batteries that power small devices. It is does not give technically fine reads, but works for household batteries."
3,Works...,Works so far. Feels a little cheap but it wasn't expensive so I guess I can't be asking for too much.
4,Very Good,"I found this calculator to be an excellent one, my sister uses it in school and she is very pleased with this cheap, but powerful calculator."
5,This stuff will go to the streets with love & laughs !Cool!,"This book is stuffed with over 200 pages of skits. Ideal for youth meetings, camps, or anytime you want to make people laugh or make a point. It compiles one-act skits, slapstick skits, sight gags, ""famous"" interviews, the classics, stunts, and audience-participation skits."
4,Visual Basic ADO Book,"This is a well written book for existing programmers who want to learn ADO. While the examples are in Visual Basic, the core concepts of ADO are very detailed and anyone with an understanding of a similar language, such as ASP or C++ should have no trouble applying the examples to the other language. It will not help you if you don't already know how to program.It also serves as a good reference book."
4,Careful,"Before you take the dive, please note that the songs on this CD are NOT the original recordings! The good part, however, offsets that because, as most of these songs were originally instrumentals anyway, their reproductions sound almost identical. Plus, unlike some other TV theme CDs, these themes are longer versions, so you get more music for your buck. Buy this while you can, especially since the cover artwork itself teases to be a collector's item with the former Twin Towers looming in the backdrop."
5,Great Rhythms and Pictures!,"This was one of my young toddler's favorites. The narrative has a superb rhythm that lends excitement to the text: ""There's a lion in the jungle and he's really on the run!"" Colorful and imaginative illustrations match the vivid story. Sure it's unrealistic, the lion might eat the other animals--but this is a very fun kids' book to read and hear."
3,I agree: Poor quality,"These are all decent workouts, but I agree with the reviewer who said the first DVD is almost unwatchable. They're sitting around a lake, there's about 25 people on the team (and they announce every last one of them by name and profession, which I found both comical and maddening), and it looks fuzzy and jumpy like the thing was shot with an early 90's camcorder. I don't want to be too picky, but if you're paying a bundled rate for five DVDs and one of them is bad, you're not getting a great deal.The second DVD is OK - the team's sitting around a brew pub (!) and the quality is not as bad as the first, but still not great. The final three DVDs are better.I would recommend just buying the individual workouts you want. I bought this collection after doing ""Lean and Mean,"" which I thought was terrific. None of the DVDs in this set are as professionally done as that one."
4,"Great workout, bad image","The workouts are fine, however the image from dvd 1, is poor quality, may be need to redo it. In the dvd 3 the sound and the image are out of sequence. Not all the dvd's have the option to make the workout with/without music. 2 of them do not have a menu to choose this option.Overall the dvd quality and packaging look cheap and low quality. The drills are very good and you can notice in your heart rate and the cadence when you are riding outside. I recommend this series is thought, but you can see the results in the road."
