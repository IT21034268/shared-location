3,"The men were all singing , ""I wish I was in Dixie.""","For obvious reasons. Barbara Stanwyck is Dixie Daisy, the headlining lady at the old opera theatre, turned burlesque house. She gets the close-ups & plenty of face time in this mediocre murder mystery. She is the only performer in this with a better than average performance. Nothing average about Stanwyck's acting. This movie stalls in several places as some really bad vadvillians get to do their bits. That apparently is part of the charm. They are supposed to be bad. Everybody is aspiring to move up to the big time. Dixie has competition from other ""ladies"" who resent her recent stardom. They are strangled by their own G-Strings. Dixie is the main suspect & she has motive. The actual murderer becomes quite evident & you will know that moment when you see it. Back stage scenes are fun but not particularly inspiring. Not a well known Stanwyck movie but it's worth it just for her."
3,Lady of Burlesque,Previously only available thru Alpha (super low price and super low quality) this little gem should keep you interested long enough to finish a box of popcorn. Maltin gives this 1943 flik 3 stars. Stanwyck is young and fun. Pinky Lee has a supporting role. Don't let the title fool you or keep you away from this fun little mystery. I'm sure the Roan Group release will run circles around the budget disc.
4,One of Cinema's Forgotten Treasures,"Although Stanwyck gives an expert and charming performance in the role of a 1940s Burlesque Queen who must unmask a serial killer before she becomes his next victim, the real pleasure of ""A Lady of Burlesque"" is the hard-knocks supporting cast of actual burlesque performers as they screech, brawl, snap and jive through a witty and for its time rather racy script. With most of the action played backstage in a 1940s ""grindhouse,"" the film offers a fascinating glimpse into the now largely-lost world of burlesque itself. It should lay ya in the aisles. But a word of warning: the film is often sold as a ""bargain"" title and I've found some quality issues on various tape releases."
3,"Good movie, bad disc","This is a review more of the DVD itself than the movie (which is fast-paced and enjoyable). I had trouble getting the disc to play on two different machines. When I finally did get it going, there's not much there besides the movie itself. No production notes, no subtitles, and the 90 minute film is divided up in only four chapters. I know I shouldn't expect much for such a low-priced DVD, but hassle-free playing would have been nice."
4,Babs does burlesque,"Barbara Stanwyck, one of my favorite classic stars (love that elegant nose!) is in top form here in this little murder mystery based on Gypsy Rose Lee's novel ""The G-String Murders"". This being the 1940's, we certainly don't see her take it all off, but she dances a couple of hot numbers and carries her performance off with considerable verve, aided ably by a top-notch supporting cast."
2,Everything you Ever Wanted to Know About Gypsy Rose Lee.....,"The only real reason to sit through this melodramatic kitsch-filled dramedy is Barbara Stanwyck. That and the fact this is an actual adaptation of the famed stripper's foray into the world of literature. Yes, folks, this slight film is based on the one, the only, Gypsy Rose Lee's story, entitled, ""G-String Murders."" It's campy fun now, but when it was penned, about 50 years ago, this was major no-no territory. My, how things have changed. Demi Moore should have watched the real pros when actors had faces, and real acting required more than forming tears at will. Stanwyck always knew she could act, and that formidable presence makes anything she stars in palatable. And who would've thunk Pinky Lee did more in his life than entertain kids...."
4,Good Swan Lake video,"This is a good version of Swan Lake becuase the supporting Ballet dancers are excellent: Polina Kirova and Luidmilla D., etc. But the main Prima Ballerina Marina R. is not very good. She does an average job and is not as good as Svetlana Z. Moscow Classical Ballet Corps are very good."
1,Turn Back Sir Henry!,"<SIGH>....I hate to say it....this album/cd stinks. Vivian Stanshall,brilliant solo artiste,frontman for The Bonzo Dog Band,and the best of British eccentrics,laid an egg. Or rather the folks who prodded him into making this did. Largely a narrative album,with some bits of song,Viv takes us on safari with Sir Henry Rawlinson and all his Rawlinson thoughts. Unfortunately....it all sounds like a rough draft,for a much more grandiose project. His voice sounds rough,making it hard to listen to for long lengths.....not to mention he just sounds flat out bored with it all. A sad example for a final Vivian release. My advice....if you want a good Rawlinson story...get ""Sir Henry At Rawlinson End"".....and if you want to hear Vivian knock your gartered socks off with songs,get ""Teddy Boys Don't Knit"". You won't go far wrong,guv!"
1,Doen't work,"The design of this device is ingenious, but it doesn't work. Devices are initially recognized by the operating system, then disconnect randomly. Replacing this product with a normal, non-retractable cable fixes the problem.FYI I.Link is just 6 pin Firewire with the two power pins removed and a smaller connector (thank you Sony for another pointless proprietary version of a perfectly good standard). Rather than this device, you should get a regular 6 pin to 4 pin Firewire cable, which come in six foot lengths typically."
5,Beautiful photographs - very engaging,"This book was highly recommended to me by a clerk at a small children's bookstore who told me that for some reason toddlers seem to find it very captivating. I bought it for my daughter for her first birthday, and she loves it. The photographs are beautiful and there's something about the penguins that seems to really grab my daughter's attention. At 14 months she seeks out this book and will ""read"" it to herself. I agree with the reviewer below who said that the ""penguins pooping"" page is a real attention-grabber for the toilet training set, and though it could be gross, something about the fact that it's a penguin who's pooping is strangely charming and humorous (if you can stomach that type of thing!). Overall five stars for a book that my daughter and I both love - a great thing for a parent who has to read it over and over."
2,wrong for gift,"This has a picture of a penguin pooping that I found embarrassing. Kids may like it, but it was not a gift that I (a doting great aunt) would have chosen for a 2 year old."
5,Makes a big splash!!,"The entire ""Busy"" series is engaging and fun for kids and parents alike. A great way to introduce your child to books, nature, language."
4,Great stroller for the price.,"I love Evenflo infant carriers, car seats and strollers so I may be a little bias. The bar that is used in securing the infant carrier to this stroller feels very stable. I love that the tray on the front of the stroller can swing open. The basket underneath provides a lot of storage. This stroller is perfect for trips to the mall. The only thing that I do not like about this stroller is that the canopy over the lower level seat is not high enough for above average height children. My son's head hits right at the bar and looks uncomfortable. Otherwise this stroller is excellent. I've had no problems with the steering, buckles, wheels, etc."
3,Where's the cupholder for the parents?,This stroller is okay to use overall but lacks in any creature comforts that other strollers have. There is a cup holder for the front child but not the back and there is nowhere for parents to put anything in the back by the handle. It folds down and travels fairly well. Have taken it to museums with no problems.
4,A great collector's reference.,"This is a great picture book, mostly done with contemporary photos of the collections of Wili Zahn and Chris Mason, two of the foremost Fallschirmjaeger collectors. For those interested in the uniforms and equipment of the German Paratroopers this book is a must. Great photography, and some rare stuff that you will never see elsewhere. A must for the collector."
4,Octavia and Lucas,"Octavia: tall lovely hospital nurse. She accepts a temporary assignment as nurse on a cruise ship where she is surprised to find the senior doctor is the large handsome Dutch man who had carried an elderly mugging victim into her Casualty ward a week or so earlier. Lucas offers Octavia a marriage of convenience because his 9-year-old daughter needs a mother (hers died so long ago that she doesn't remember her) and Octavia accepts. There are misunderstandings, jealousies, and reticences to be overcome, and malicious people who foster the misunderstandings on purpose, but of course they are thwarted at last. Very satisfying!"
5,it great,"This cd is up beat and you will enjoy it a lot, thee musicians, are great. The singers voice is diffrent, but very enjoyable. All i have to say is cheak it out"
2,somewhat overpriced,"Perhaps the demand for written Cambodian expertise is low in the US? Because otherwise why is this set of 2 books valued at $135? There are no fancy graphics. In fact, there appear to be no figures at all. Just plain text.The material, at least in English, has excerpts from various topics likely to be encountered by a translator. These include politics and social issues. The intersection of these are excerpts on the royal family and their role in the national government."
1,Don't bother.,"I bought this tool for the idea of having a rasp and a lifter in 1 tool. Unfortunately the rasp wore down to nothing on my first day of use after hanging just 6 sheets of rock. Now I'm left with just a lifter, which doesn't even work that great.The package claims 100% satisfaction guaranteed so I emailed the company to tell them about this product and I got no response from them. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,Trantric infusion,This movie gives no sense of infusion. Viewers just don't get the urge or passion. Hot Scenes are much weaker than R-rated movies. I don't recommend this junk.
1,tantric infusion,tantric is more tis was an and small verse of this movie i like dancing much more bad choose on my behalf
3,Interesting,I found this film to be interesting. I liked the subject matter: two people developing a deeper bond based on Eastern philosophies.
5,Shame on Nintendo for not building the Classic Controller like this to begin with,"It's cheap and makes the controller less awkward and more comfortable to use. Personally, I didn't quite like how it felt with the wiimote stored in the center (not quite as much room to grip the classic controller), but I really don't mind having the wiimote on my lap. Overall, well worth the $5."
2,Without significant Advantage,"I haven't perceived advantages significant that it can offer to the classic control of Wii, during a game it tends to disarticulate with facility and increases the weight in my hands during the game."
3,"good, but","it fits really nice and makes holding the controller and using it a lot easier. but mine must be defective or something, because i can't figure out how to clip the wiimote to it with a darn."
1,Controller Grip,"Did not tell you that you also needed an extra item that was not included to use it. Very unhappy. Have not been able to use it at all,"
1,Wii Classic Controller Grip review,"For $5, there was no reason to pass it up. All the reviews I read were positive. I guess it must be me but I could not get the Wiimote holder to stay connected to the grip.It was not worth the money to mail it back to amazon for a refund.I would not reccommend this item at all."
5,Brilliant!!,This is exactly what I have been waiting for. Nyko has hit this one out of the park! Now my hands don't cramp up when using my classic controller. It really does an amazing job of making it easier and more comfortable to hold and the best part is that the Wii wand stores directly under the grip. It holds it perfectly so there's no lose cord at all and nothing jiggles around. The classic controller grip does its job perfectly.
4,For Western liberals,"This is a fascinating book, consisting mainly of testimonials by ex-Muslims. Muslim readers will tend to reject it out of hand, but I think Western liberals ought to read it in order to realise that there is no such things as an ""Islam Lite"" basically compatible with their own ideology.One thing that worries me about many of the testimonials is that so many of the writers justify their apostacy by their discovery of a new ideology, Science. They accept various scientific hypotheses uncritically, just as they once revered the text of the Koran.Most worrying of all, one testimonial writer justifies her apostacy on the grounds of having discovered the new religion of Freudian psychology. Is this a step forward?"
1,"This book is full of opinions, opinions, and more opinions.","I read the whole book at barnes in noble because I knew what to expect.The book is written by a man that has a Muslim name but is not and never was a Muslim. His books are all opinionated. They are the exact opposite of what is going on in reality. More and more people are coming to Islam, rather than leaving it. He has testimony from CHRISTIANS! How lame! This guy is obviously trying to make a quick buck. Beware, one of the worst authors, might I add. He lacks basic writing skills. My 14 year old brother could do better than this garbage.DO NOT BUY THIS OPINIONATED BOOK THAT HAS NO REAL FACTS!"
1,From a neutral viewpoint,"From a neutral analysis of the book, one feels that the author, for some reason, is extremely biased against Islam. So much so, that he has completely lost the spirit of the basic rules for being a rational critic. I also had a lot of problems with the authenticity of his sources, his academic qualification and his claim to be an apostate.West Virginia University,Montgomery, WV."
4,From the inside out!,"Before you get into Islam, read this book. It's not so easy getting out! Americans need to become informed about this religion of ""peace"" NOT!"
4,Try the sample before downloading it,"This review is not about the contents of the book because I didn't have the chance to read it as I had a problem opening it using my Windows 8 tablet. If you are using the kindle application for Windows 8, download the sample book first and see if you can open it.The Amazon Helpdesk were very helpful and very generous in their efforts to fix this issue but it seems that there is an issue with the book itself as I can read other kindle books using the same tablet.The error message I was getting says""Unsupported contentThis book is not optimized for Kindle for Windows 8.I think I will buy the hard copy.I gave this book 4 starts based on the others reviews."
2,A correction to one of the reviewers,A reviewer has said that there is a verse quoted that is not in Quaran and is fabricated. Its not so. Only the reference is wrong. The verse is there at 3:90. The author and reviewer both should have worked a little harder.
3,Don't Read this Yet...,"You should simply read Why I am Not a Muslim for starters and then round that off with the Quest for The Historical Muhammed. Those books, I know for a fact, contain only accurate quotes, when comparing it to my 'official' Q'uran from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Also, read John Wansbrough if you are serious about finding out what the real origins of the Q'uran are- his writing is abstract, sophisticated and dense but well worth the read for any serious students of the faith/philosophy of Islam."
2,Not always effective,"I have two cats, one hates it the other thinks it's cat nip...Doesn't really work out so great. Word count"
1,No Effect,"I tired this to keep my cats from worrying their sutures after a declaw. They sniffed it, went, ""Blech! I don't want this on me!"" and proceeded to lick it off.Though I should note that these cats have shown no aversion to citrus sprays (like those to keep them from clawing things) either."
2,Doesn't work long enough and makes the house smell bad.,"Although this did repel my kitten on first smell, it didn't repel her long enough--she was back within minutes--to bother with it when this bottle runs out. Also, I don't like the roll-on top for this so put the liquid into a spray bottle. It's also a repellent to me, as well. I can't stand the smell and don't want to be around it. I'm trying to keep her from scratching and prowling around places she doesn't belong, not me. I'll stick with other methods."
2,Hmmm....It didn't work,"This product didn't keep cats away from my wires. In fact, it appears that they became more curious after application."
3,Product okay,"Ordered this on advice from a friend. Haven't seen much result from using it. The service was fine, the product, ""so-so""."
2,So-so,"Worked okay, two of my cats try to avoid sprayed areas, one could care less. Needed respeayed every day... Wish it came with a sprayer nozzle, not just roller, so I transferred to my own bottle. Spray better than nothing I suppose, but not sure if will buy again"
3,Works under certain circumstances,"This product works great IF you apply it just before the cat decides to chew, but not much later. You would have to apply it every day, perhaps several times a day, faithfully, in order for it to always work--- apparently, the taste doesn't linger for long. Even so, when it's fresh, it works VERY well!"
1,Doesn't work,"It might be just my cat, but even dousing something heavily in this doesn't make a difference. The product does nothing to repel her."
2,Did not seem to work well,Figured it was worth a try to see if it kept the cat away from the Christmas tree. Not sure that it worked. Cat would run when I sprayed but seemingly came back nearly immediately. I could have sprayed water and had a similar effect.
5,It works!,My cat chews cords and just about anything else that has a plastic or rubber texture. We spray this stuff on and he leaves it alone. This was not the first product we tried. The first product the cat just licked off the cords. Not very effective. Now we have it in the dabber. This is great cause we can just rub it along the cord and it doesn't get where we don't want it. Great product!
5,Excellent floor sweep,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is an excellent ""tool"" to clean up all of the dust and scraps that have would up on the floor. The unit it self is sturdy and should stand up to lots of use. But that is not all it can do.I found one very cool use for the floor sweep. Since I don't have a sanding table with built in dust collection, I tried something different. I clamped the floor sweep to my bench top and sanded my project in front of the sweep. All of the sanding mess was sucked up into the sweep and away into my DC system.I definitely give Jet Floor Sweep 1003 and my Jet DC 1100 a big thumbs up."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I started this book but simply couldn't continue. The author spends most of his time telling us how wonderful he is for having discovered this mode of treating high cholesterol. The actual content is worth only a magazine article worth of space. If you need this treatment, go to a doctor and have him explain to you how to take the niacin and what the side effects will be -- you can't use the treatment except under a doctor's supervision anyhow. The book is a waste of money."
2,cholesterol,"Not a bad book at all. Pretty good one to learn about cholesterol etc..BUT one must go to a dr. and be under a drs supervision for niacin . It is not good to take OTC niacin without a drs consult > This is all stated in the book of course..SOme folks could do the prescription niacin well , others might not be able to. Check with your dr."
4,cholesterol control without diet,"Dr. Parsons presents a powerful argument for the use of niacin as a lipid lowering agent. His argument would be more powerful on a professional level if he would limit his emotional attachment and let the facts speak for themselves. I agree with his conclusions regarding the effectiveness of niacin and with the power of the pharmaceutical industry to shape public and medical opinion. In my opinion, however, he does downplay the incidence of certain side-effects of niacin and to some extent exxagerates the bad effects of other drugs.In total, this is a solid book that supplies a great deal of information that can greatly decrease one's risk of heart disease."
4,It's a rock and roll symphony and it's gonna be the death of me.,"This is a tribute album to the Rutles, the Beatles parody group. All 20 songs from the Rutlesfirst albumare covered here. Most of the cover versions here are pretty good. Long live Rock and Roll!"
1,mere propaganda-not history,"I possess a copy of this book,which I do not deem as being the work of a serious historian.Rather,it is simply a dated and stale product of WWII British propaganda,and certainly better works have been written on the same subject.See for example the book by David Fraser.The role of the Italians -who made up the great majority of Rommel's soldiers in the African theater- is grossly underestimated,and ripe with negative clichès on their fighting capabilities,while at the same time skillfully avoiding to give any credit to their most valuable units,such as Ariete,Folgore or Giovani Fascisti.Not the work of an historian.A waste of time."
3,Good read but not too accurate,"Written by a soldier who has experienced first hand the desert war, naturally makes this book a good read. However it was written just after WW2 and there was much myth and confusion surrounding the figure of Rommel himself. A standard biography during its time(churchill constantly refers to this book in his WW2 memoirs), however time and research has revealed that Young's portrayal of Rommel's character is not so accurate. For example he says that Rommel was humble and disliked publicity but we now know that the Desert Fox was quite vain, courted publicity and exploited it. The best book on Rommel is I beleive, David Irving's ""On the trail of the FOX"". The book reads like an explosive novel and I finished the book in one night. Fraser's ""knight's cross"" is also very detailed although it is not as exiting a read as Irving's book."
3,Has its merits,"Written shortly after the war, Rommel is a fairly sympathetic biography of the famed ""Desert Fox"". Most interesting was the story of his pre-war military service, in particular his service during the First World War. Previously not familiar with this, I found it interesting how it was tactics learned while serving with a special Wuerttemburg army unit that influenced his thinking during the North Africe campaign. Certainly worth reading for all those interested in the war, but there are no doubt better, more thorough studies of Rommel available."
2,"Not enough crow information, mostly personal observances","This book wasn't what I expected. 24 years of living with a crow should amount to much more interesting experiences than a handful of personal observances of how this crow felt and how it schemed, which seemed too one-sided."
4,"Nice sprayer, but hose doesn't get it.","I wondered what all the talk was about with HVLP. It really doesn't seem all that different from the old sprayer I had. I'd probably do it again, though... but the hose reeeally needs work. It is promoted as a flexible hose, and that is the downfall. You step on it and the spray instantly becomes a dribble... messing up your paint or whatever. If the hose gets a kink when you pull it, there goes the dribble again. They really need to re-engineer the hose. It is much quieter than the old compressor I used. With three patterns you can do some pin-point accuracy too."
5,Great Customer Service From Fuji,"I just received my Q3 and upon opening the box, the air hose was abraded in one spot so that the nylon threads were showing. Now, it didn't affect the operation but over the life of the hose, I figured it might fail prematurly some day. I called Fuji on Saturday and left a message about the problem. Monday morning at 11:00am I received a call from Fuji.After I explained the problem, they shipped me a new hose and told me to keep the old one as a spare. The customer service rep was very friendly and helpful. I was amazed at how responsive they were and willing to make things right. This company knows the meaning of customer service!The manual that came with the sprayer is quite thorough. It really explains the operation and maintenance of the . It also gives basic spraying technique, general thinning/viscosity guidelines and other suggestions.I would definitely buy this unit again!"
4,"A Wonderful, Though Brief, Read","I read this book from cover to cover and enjoyed most of the pieces. The anthology is quite a varied gathering of gay Latino writers at many stages of their careers, so it was interesting to note how this collection balanced the range of literary talents. I was impressed by most of the pieces, disappointed in others. If you read this collection you will recognize the weak writing rather quickly. (Find out for yourself!) I was, however, a bit dismayed that so many of these stories dealt with sex. There were few exceptions. So I found it difficult to see how this collection offered anything different from the mediocre ""white gay"" collections that have flooded the market recently, other than that these are gay Latinos. But that is just an observation, not necessarily a criticism. I still have to commend this effort, kudos to Mr. Manriquez. I have found some new voices here that I know are sure to make a difference in the changing landscape of American literature."
2,Lack of Consistency,"This book is one of the weakest collections of stories I've ever read. Painted Leaf Press has a habit of throwing out half-baked stories. It's called Editor. Get one. Many of these stories had great potential, but lacked execution. Others were just cliche. Emanuel Xavier paints a nice story. but his words on the page are flat, flat, flat. The strongest, most complete stories are by a group of San Francisco writers: Jaime Cortez, Joel Villalon and Al Lujan. They have even stronger pieces in another book that came out a year after this one: Virgins, Guerrillas and Locas. You'd be better served getting that book instead. it has a better cover too."
5,Wonderful compilation of Miller's thoughts,"This book is an incredible trip through out Miller's ideas. The essays on the book are very well selected and disposed in a good way for the readers to understand what Arthur Miller is all about. There's no better way to know somebody other than this persons' own words. And this is what's so special about this book. We get to know Arthur Miller through his own special words. The first essay, ""Tragedy and the Common Man"" is already classical for its contents. Most of the books about Arthur Miller talk about it, but this very book happens to be the only way for us to actually read the whole text. Summing up: if you're willing to go to the bootom of this very important writer, this is the book you must choose."
5,A world of difference,"The old blade on my saw had been abused, to say the least, and was in dire need of replacement. The price for this set was unbeatable and I needed both a rough cut and a finish blade anyway. I have finished 3-4 mid to large projects with these blades already and they still cut great. No wobbles in the blades, cut true, a great value. I will be buying another set when these wear out, which I don't expect will be any time soon. Very pleased!!!"
2,Dull Fast!,"Both of these blades became very dull very quickly. IMHO, the metal is poor quality and these should be avoided."
4,Good bargain,"IIRC, this set was $40 more at the hardware store than on Amazon. I can't really say whether or not they perform perfectly because I'm not a professional who knows what to look for. However, for a novice like myself, they seem to do exactly what I bought them for - to cut wood and to do it cheaply. Like I said before though, I will leave the close scrutiny to someone who knows exactly what they're talking about.Experience level in relation to this tool: low"
5,Miter saw blades,"I have not used these Dewalt blades yet but,I know because they will perform great as they always do. Thank you"
4,80 tooth and 32 tooth blades for DEwalt Chop Saw.,Excellent additions for the saw. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. (had to fill the space)
4,Tools For The Job,These Blades are the ticket when you are on jobs and could run into almost any need as we all know
3,Somewhat Satisfied,"My order from this company was a bit slow. I ordered SG2W-6 spring grip and got a mixed order of SG2W and SG2. I really like to get specifically what I order and not a mixed shipment of what they have on hand. I have ""mixed"" feelings about ordering from this company again."
2,NOT CARRIE UNDERWOOD!!!,"I bought this item, and I was really dissapointed!! On the CD, it says ""Not Actual Recordings"" That is true. The recordings are done professionally, by someone who DEFINATELY IS NOT CARRIE UNDERWOOD!! None of the songs sounded like her. They didn't even sound like country!The different vocals are OKAY, but they ARE NOT CARRIE UNDERWOOD!"
3,An aging classic,"Once a classic of imagination, but now an outdated, tedious read, it is at least short. Read it if you have to in college (if you happen to major in Computer Science or Math)"
2,Vitamin Review,This product was late arriving to me and I wish to return it. I had to purchase from another vendor.
4,It's the water.,"Measure out a large handful of musically-inclined friends into the basement of a red brick, suburban Detroit tract home. Blend in an enormous collection of pre-1985 punk, garage rock, first-wave psychedelic, and obscure country records. Season with mind-altering spices to taste. Cover and store for long Michigan winter. Shake periodically. Serve on dubbed cassette at muddy Metropark during first desperate attempt at cook-out of the year. Laugh at the normal people because someday the stuff in the water will mess up their kids, too."
4,Powerful,"The author talks about each of the poems before she reads them. In that way we get a kind of autobiography of J.A. Jance's early years, focusing especially what she went through while in a disastrous marriage to a hardcore alcoholic (9 rehab stints in 7 years!). Still, she never makes it clear why she stayed for so many years, and there is nothing new in her experiences or revelations."
4,Nice Moon Landing Book for the 10-12 Year Old Crowd,"Jim Irwin was the Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 15 mission to the moon and became the eight man to walk on the moon. Prior to this book, he had written two others books (To Rule the Night and More than Earthlings) about his adventures in space; however unlike this book, these books were geared for the adult audience.In this book, the author, writing in the first person, describes his life from slightly before the time he applied to be an astronaut, his selection as an astronaut, his training and his eventual trip to and from the moon. There was a fair amount of material dedicated to the training needed to be an astronaut and moon walker, more than I've seen in the usual astronaut biographies. The book also includes many photographs in both color and black and white, to help the reader understand Jim Irwin's life and times at NASA."
2,heroine wrong path,"This series is turning into ""good person, goes slutty. Nothing to these stories now except how many men she is attracted to and sleeps with. Ridiculous!"
5,Good athour,I have read at least 10-13 of her books so I am kind of behind but if u like vampire/werewolf books with murder and mystery then u might like the Anita Blake Novels..She is a human Servent who is also a Necromancer and dating the vampire of the city and a werewolf and wereleopard etc crazy series lol
4,This series is aways fun to read.,"Actuall,I would give this book 41/2 stars if the ratings would allow. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars would be Edward. I wish in the next book that they are teamed together and he has to come to terms with her increasing num. of men that are in her group. Musette was fantastic and wierd as usual the two small children vampires Valentina and Bartolome could be valuable assets to Anita and Jean-Claud in future books when the Vampire Council comes into town. I'm really unhappy about Richard I hope that he can come to terms with all his issues and once more become part of the tri. But I'm reall glad that Jason finally got a major part in this story he is also one of my favorites. I also hope that Dolph can learn to accept Anits's new lifestyle or they will always be at odds. Good book, read and enjoy you will be glad that you did. I just hope that she hurries up with the next book. I can't wait."
5,Anita is back!,This book was really good. It continues the story and adds new levels to an already complicated scene. I finished it in one sitting and can't wait for more.
2,Not up to standard,"Unlike all the previous books of the series, this one was not unputdownable. In fact I found myself putting it down after every couple of pages. And then picking it up again a few minutes later.I still do not quite understand it but I have a sense of unfulfillment. There's a just great big *something* missing. Anita does spend more time in bed - but we saw that coming in ""Narcissus in Chains"". She faced, and faced down, more bad guys and even had a very well written and serendipitous escape from the spooks. Ms Hamilton set the stage for future encounters with bigger and badder bad guys, which is a constant challenge for a writer.But still, I was disappointed and vaguely unsatisfied. All in all, it's still worth buying and reading - but not anything to be proud of. I suspect Anita is not the only one needing a long vacation"
3,diasappointed,"It's easy to be picky when I didn't have to do the work of writing but....This was not the best, or as good as I had hoped. I do think it has introduced more characters and that perhaps the next book will be great. I was left feeling a sort of wait for it. The last few pages were a really frantic wrap up, as if it needed to be finished NOW. There are characters from previous books I would like to see revisited, like Otto from Butterfly. I thought the plot was thin, and if there must be so much sex it was not as well done as in Narcissus. But it was nice to see Jason and Asher in more detail. Anita's suffering is getting tiresome. Her always saying 'Sorry I didn't know', stopping to argue over morals when the plot needs to move on or dawn is coming.Let Richard do all that kind of stuff, that's his character.I'll continue to buy, but I won't rush for a hard back again."
2,Not her best...but closer to her worse,"The plot is rehashed with the Vampire Council (in the form of Belle Morte and her entourage) coming to threaten Anita Blake and Company.The serial killer is laughablly close to Anita (as always) and quickly discovered and dealt with by her. The main plot fizzles off as no harm comes to anyone.Hamilton leads into a surprise, but as it goes it isn't that great...maybe it will be in a book or two.Less sex and no romance. The entire book left me wanting and wondering why I continue to read the Anita Blake Series when the Merry Gentry Series is so much better.I am a long time Anita Blake and LKH fan...and I am becoming disillusioned with the plots, characters and writing style..."
3,Getting tiresome,"Although I am a great fan of Laurell K Hamilton, this last book in this series was a disappointment to me. There seemed to be two separate plots in this particular book, her professional life and her personal life, and they did not flow well together. She might as well have not mentioned any zombie raising or police work at all.Anita's sex life is also getting a little out of hand and the fact that she keeps coming up against an even more powerful evil force and defeating them is getting tiring. I did like the growth of the other characters like Jason and Asher, and the police stuff was good - just wish there had been more.Unlike many people, I did enjoy Narcissus but this book seemed like a repeat of Burnt Offerings but with the sub-plot of the ardeur thrown in. I will probably continue reading any new Anita novels but it is no longer as exciting as it used to be. I'm hoping that her next Merry adventure will be better than this Anita one."
3,"Ok, but expected it to be better","I got hooked into the series last year and usually burn through all of her books fairly quickly. Cerulean Sins, though, just seems to lack that amazing suspense that all of the earlier books had. It was a good read and you learn a lot more information about Jean Claude and Asher, but there was too much psychoanalysis in the book and not enough hard core action. I guess that I was just too hyped up for this new book and expected more."
3,Going downhill,"Like many others I have to say that the series seems to be going downhill, starting with the previous book, Narcissus in Chains. Cerulean Sins isn't a bad book, mind you, but it doesn't have the engaging plot or characters that the earlier books in the series have.I find it amusing that the person that seems to really like this book has only read three books in the series, that would leave 7 books from which to compare this one too. I know, I know...this is its own seperate work, that said, it is part of a series and you would think it would follow suit.Anita's powers are continuing to grow, great...tell us why? All men seem to want her....ok, again, why? Then there is the fiasco LKH made of Dolph...why?I admit that I will read Incubus Dreams, but at this point it is only because I am anal and want to read the entire series. My interest level is waning."
2,It should have been called Sex Sins,"The latest in the Anita Blake series is just as bad as the last. I am sorry I read it, it changed my opinion of the character of Anita Blake. The older books were mystery and a no nonsense kinda girl who pulled no punches. Now the whole book is about sex and, in my opinion, the downfall of Anita Blake. She is so out of character anymore, that it is no fun to read. When over 200 pages are devoted to sex scenes, I might as well read romance novels."
5,Shifting focus,"Personally, I loved Cerulean Sins and barely moved in the time it took me to read the whole thing. I really like the way the series is going, but many may not. The focus in the last few books has started shifting away from the crime-oriented aspects that were so prevalent in the first books and more towards elationships, vampire/wereanimal politics, and character development. So while there are still elements of Anita's daytime career stuff, it's no longer as integral to the story - which I figure that'll either put you off or please you. I'm the latter. Great book. Laurell Hamilton is one of very few authors I'll buy in hardcover."
4,Great Teaser to another Book,I just finished reading the book totally in one day. I couldn't put it down. Many things that I had been hoping would happen finally did in the book. It is a great teaser to what will happen in the next Anita Blake book. Many questions still yet to be answer and some doors open for new questions. An amazing book and like the others never long enough. Always leaving you searching for another bite so we just must wait for the next book but what things to ponder as we wait.
3,"Formulaic, series running out of steam","Unfortunately, the Anita Bryant series are being written using a predictable formula: Super scary uber monster comes to town, threatens Anita and her monster family. Anita has gratuitous sex. Anita insults uber monster. Anita has sex. Anita kills something. Anita has sex.Look I love that Anita is now leader of her own wereleopard pard (pack) and has almost super powers, but I wish we could do more interesting plot development and less gratuitous sex.I'm not quite to the point of giving up on the Anita Bryant series but unless things get better ..."
2,"If you like the preternatual and soft porn, this book is for you.","I read an excerpt from ""Narcissus in Chains"" in Nora Roberts ""Out of this World"" collection and have since been looking for that book or its sequel as it seemed from the excerpt to possibly be a fascinating series. I am very disappointed with the book as a whole as it is definitely not my type of story. Anita has sex with and or sleeps with too many guys and all of them either lycanthropes or vampires!! She tries to show she has morals by not having actual intercourse with all of them but to me that is naive, which she is not. The sexual escapades and their descriptions are more pornographic than erotic and without any romance - a deep disappointment.However, I did enjoy the tracking down of a serial killer as that subplot was interesting although this time it was the violence and gore that were too graphic!If you like graphic violence and sex, you would enjoy this book. I do not."
4,YAY! JEAN-CLAUDE IS BACK!,"I don't care what anyone says, although I do agree that there was just too much political blather. I also got bored with Mother Dearest's and Belle Morte's visits -- too much and too long. I'm just so happy to have Jean-Claude back. And, I must say, I didn't mind Jason's parts in the book, either."
3,not her best work,I'm a big Anita fan and the latest work is not up to Laurell K. Hamiltion's usual standards. The story itself is VERY weak; the plot jumps from seb-plot to sub-plot. It doesn't feel like there even is a main story; it's all just an excuse to throw Anita into strange sexual encounters.
2,Someone needs to give LKH some help,"There are more books coming and maybe she gets some better input, but Anita is disgusting at this point. Whatever the excuse, she is a total tramp and has finally embraced it. That is so ridiculous for a character who kept Richard and Jean-Claude waiting for months without giving in to them. Her editor must have told her that the books need more sex to be interesting because there is no good explanation otherwise.I think that the storyline is interesting if you just want to know how things will turn out in the end. Any respect that I have for most of the characters is wearing thin and the entire moral climate of the entire Preternatural community is just ridiculous. It's like any concept of the morality of humanity gets tossed aside. For that reason above all I find Richard to be appealing, he has not forsaken who he was simply because he has been infected with a virus."
2,Disappionted,"I have enjoyed the previous books in the Anita Blake series. I couldn't read them fast enough. I was really looking forward to this book coming out and I am very disappointed with the result. Anita has spent the last couple of books getting tough and kicking some serious supernatural butt. In this book, I was frustrated with how she seemed to wimp out. I just wanted a reaction or a really good fight. I also think that Richard is starting to get really annoying and she should just take his character right out. I finished this book totally unsatisfied. I am hoping the next one will be more like the others."
2,"I kinnot hold'er cap'n, she's breakin' up...","This wasn't even a LKH novel, at least that is what I'm telling myself in order to be up for future books. It had little story line, what it did have was incoherent and very un-LKH like. One sexual travesty to the next and then in the last few pages the quick ""Last five minutes of Star Trek"" wrap up. This book contains brief mentions of the furry... the upcoming new ""big-bad"" and then it ends with a bit of an ""eh"". This book could have been so much more, should have been so much more. This would have been the ultimate Edward book, but he was emasculated in Obsidian Butterfly.I hate to say it, but I'm losing my faith. I miss the old Anita.Guess I'll have to go back and read the earlier books in the series for my ""fix"".Bitterly Disappointed"
2,Making a slow and painful recovery.. right???,"Anita Blake was a great series! I loved everything about Anita, even if some of the other characters were a little stereotypical (Jean-Claude) or annoying (I find Richard's ""poor me"" act irritating). But it seems like Ms. Hamilton peaked with Obsidian Butterfly. Naricissus in Chains was excruciatingly long and pointless. But I'm talking about Cerulean Sins, so let me get back to that.All in all, it was much better than Naricissus, that's for sure. I even got excited, thinking things were going to get back on track. But I agree with many reviews about this book. Hamilton's losing her edge and is resorting to sex to make up for it. The serial killer plot in this book became a subplot and left a lot of things unexplained. I bought this book because half of the reviews raved about it and the other half downed it. I wanted decide on my own, now I feel like I should've checked it out of the library instead of buying it."
4,Impressed,"Personally, I'm liked this last book, as for it being too sex oriented, can I say Narcissus??? The book still had a good plot, and it kept moving till the end. I think that she needs to loose some of the guy baggage, but, hey, shes ok with it."
3,"Not the best, but not terrible.","I think the reason people don't like this book as much as some of the others is because it seems to be a stepping-stone book -- something even bigger is going to happen in the next novel, something involving the Council. That's why this one seems to drop off so quickly.THAT SAID...The pacing was good. The sex was good, if a little weird in places.Some lines were overused (""tan version of the Mummy's hand""). The Big Bad Non-Vampire Enemy was too glossed-over and that angle ended too quickly.On the other hand, the development of many of the minor characters was appreciated, and if you like Jason, you'll ADORE many parts of this book. There were some scenes with Asher that were well-written.The ending reminds me a bit of the denoument of Harry Potter 4 (Goblet of Fire). But no one complained about that.Read it if you like Anita. But if you've never read Laurell K. Hamilton before, start with _Lunatic Cafe_."
1,Someone take LKH's pen away from her!!,"I am officially done w/ Anita. I have always reread books but starting w/ Narcissus and now this abomination, I am boycotting her!Sex is fine, I'm no prude, but LKH either needs therapy or a good lay, because her frustration is ruining her writing. I wish she paid even a modicum of attention to her fans. Just about all of them hate the direction that this series has gone, the only reason the Anita makes the bestsellers list is because her fans buy the book in hopes that this time it will be different. That won't last two more Anita books.If you like LKH and want to read something that is closer to her older stuff than I recommend the Merry series. Consign Anita to the grave, something I wish that LKH's publisher would do!"
1,What Happened to Anita,"While the book was well written, it lacked the kick butt Anita that we all know and love. This book was way too much sex, politics and the ardeur. Anita used to have morals, and now she seems to be sleeping with everyone. Please have Anita go back to the old Anita. As a fan, my wife and I couldn't wait for the new book to be released, but we are both disappointed with this story. Ms Hamilton seems to be confusing Anita with Mary from the Fairy series. Let's get Anita back on track, and be the old kick-butt, monster killer. The story would have been better if she had been tracking the killer the whole time, and dealing with the vampires as a side story as in the earlier books."
1,Another Disappointment,"I read this series through #10. Missed #11 and picked this up. Disappointment is a word a lot of reviewers have used. I think its just a shame that lkh has ruined such a good series. I liked anita blake. she was feisty, had 2 jobs and a real life. There were monsters and with each book she somehow managed to survive. She also had a fun relationship with the cops where she helped solve supernatural crime. I don't know know who this person is and I can't believe I missed this much in 1 book. Boring. Sex scenes can be spicy. Sex scenes without a story is boring. Such a shame. Like the movies, no one watches porn all the way through. The same goes with books. I didn't finish this. Goodbye Ardeur. (Praise God) Goodbye anita."
1,I expected more from LKH...,"If you are not a fan of the series/new to the series, this is not the book for you. If you are a long time fan of the series, this book will be a great disappointment.After the redeeming Narcissus in Chains, I thought the series was back on track. However, Cerulean Sins is just Hamilton's foray into the world of Harlequin Romance novels. The crime subplot, usually expertly weaved into the story, seems vague and tacked on. The ""Sweet Mother"" concept seemed a little far-fetched and unnecessary (as far-fetched as possible in a world populated with preternaturals). Richard's involvement seemed like simply a ""Remember this guy? He's still a lame-wad who needs counseling.""This book is most assuredly one of the low points in an ordinarily fine series. Stick with books 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8-10 for Anita at her finest."
2,Disappointment,"I have always been a fan of this series, but it has gone down hill during the last two books and I am begining to lose hope of improvement. I thought NIC had been a step down in qaulity, but this one was worse. Any hint of a solid plot and strong in depth characters have been given up in favor of sex, sex, and more sex. I don't mind it here and there but if that is what I wanted to read I would buy the dime a dozen grocery store variety. This book is definatly not worth being bought in hard cover. Wait till it comes out in paperback. What happened to the idea of a good story?"
2,Something missing.,"I have long been a huge fan of this series, but I have to say that Cerulean Sins has let me down. I started reading the LKH books, I randomly checked Narcissus in Chains out of my local library and liked it so much that I went back to the beginning of the series and have read each book up until now. At this point, I feel like CS is a waste of my time. Lots and lots of meaningless sex and I am not even half way through. Were it not for the fact that I have all the other newer books in the series sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read, I think I might skip this installment! Sadly, and I dont know if anyone else has noticed this, the Merry Gentry series is also going the way of meaningless sex.....not sure what is going to happen but I think devoted fans are becoming somewhat fed up."
1,The saddest thing of all...,"...is that it could actually have been a pretty good story had it been written differently. Theme: ""Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""Here we have Anita Blake, an interesting and sympathetic character. With each book she gets more power. Each villain she goes up again, she defeats. The eventual result is a complete degradation of her character. The Anita of Cerulean Sins is indistinguishable from the characters from the earlier books whom she so reviled.Had only this character assassination been intentional...but it seem as if the only thing the author is interested in writing is repetitive sex scenes...I used to love the series. However, after NC and this book, I doubt that I will read anything else by this author again.Really quite sad."
1,"Waste of paper, time, and talent","I enjoyed the earlier books in the Anita Blake series - a strong female protagonist, biting sarcasm, an interesting cast of supporting characters. However, Cerulean Sins is essentially a series of mediocre porn shorts connected by a thin plot. The supporting characters have been largely reduced to one-dimensional hangers-on. There's a ridiculous overuse of certain imagery (metaphysical beasts roaring through psyches like freight trains, for example). I started to really dislike Anita in this book. That the other characters remain so enamored of her is totally unrealistic. It's time to put Anita to rest; LKH's talent would be better used inventing a new hero."
1,don't know,"Have not been mailed the book, have writen once to sender and have heard nothing. As of now very unhappy."
2,could get better,"I read this book, and was disappointed at the end, when I realized that all that was in less than 24 hours. It was entertaining and all, but I felt kind of cheated at the end, like the book wasn't finished, but the words stopped."
2,nothing new,"most of the books in the blake vampire series have offered something new. not this one. i still plan on reading the next book(s) in the series, but very little happened. the excitement peaked in the middle, and the ending was a let down. also, the plot was not extended much at all, leaving me wondering what Ms. Hamilton was trying to accomplish. In that respect it reminds me of Robert Jordan's latest, i read it so i can read the next book, but felt like nothing happened. Wait for paperback or till you can borrow it from someone.the only reason i rated it 2 stars instead of 1 was that it still involved characters i liked, and it was easy reading, just like the rest of the series."
2,Where's the mystery?,I first started reading Anita Blake because of the mysteries in each book. Now there's just sex.
5,I love this book,"The whole Anita Blake series is simply amazing!!! LK Hamilton's last 3 of the AB series and her most controversial are simply some of the best character development ever! NC, CS and ID have some of most amazing depth of characters revelations in them I have ever read ( did not say they were hard to read sometimes but they were essential to the characters development not just Anita's ) in a long time. The famous desk scene with Jean Claude and Anita this leads up to one of the most important revelations in the whole series ( you will have to read the book). Each character is unique and brings a depth of humanity to the series. I think sometime people do not like change in there main characters but there has to be growth or the character stagnates and LKH really knows how to shake things up !!! I don't know what everyone else read but I read three wonderful books."
3,NOT MY FAVORITE OF THE SERIES,"I'M A BIG FAN OF LAURELL K. HAMILTON'S ANITA BLAKE SERIES. I CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T ENJOY THIS BOOK, BUT IT WASN'T AS EXCITING AS THE OTHERS, PARTICUARLY BLUE MOON. I WANTED MORE OF RICHARD IN THIS ONE AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE. I CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK IN THIS SERIES."
2,Disappointing. Very disappointing,"I have been an avid fan of the series until Narcissus in Chains. I had hoped that Cerulean Sins would prove the last book just a fluke. Sadly, it seems someone has convinced Ms. Hamilton that she must change from writing fast paced, character driven action novels to becoming the latest Ann Rice clone.Changing Anita from a character of relatively stable morality to simply sleeping with whoever is close at hand is also a disappointment, as are the gratuitous insults of conservative Christians."
4,confused feelings,I have read every book LKH has written and loved them until CS.This had a great start which captured your interest but sadly fell into a mish mash of stories. Gregory and Stephen should develop into their own story and so should Jason who finally has come into his own. I am glad Richard has given me a reason to really dislike him. I was never interested in a man who could not accept both his good and bad sides with out sounding like a big whiner.I also would like to see Asher with his own storyline as he and Jean Claude are both such powerful figures.I have never been able to put down a LKH book until it was finished but with this one I could. Please LKH give us another Guilty Pleasures.
4,Still loving Anita and company,"Though this is not the best of the Anita Blake series I did enjoy this book alot. One reason I think I liked it so much is that it reminded me of Burnt Offerings, my favorite of all the Anita books. Also there are a lot of tender moments between Anita and Jaun Claude that makes you feel thier love very much. I never tire of the secondery characters in this series and this book is no exception. When I finished the book I was craving more."
2,"Could she have more sex, please?","Of all the Anita Blake books, I found this one to be the most disappointing. I have read the entire series, and I feel that the series started to fall apart aound the same time she slept with Richard in Blue Moon. The endings seem rushed, and there are too many sub-plots to ever really wrap the books up nicely.That said- it bothers me that now it is alright for her to just jump anything in sight. Part of what was so fun about the earlier books was it was just Anita, there wasn't a penis on hand at all times. I think the ardeur was really only an excuse to add an extraneous sex scene here and there.The book could have been good, as with the last couple books (not including obsidian butterfly- best one since bloody bones) the general idea of the plot was good, but execution was faulty.I am disappointed that I spent the money on this book that I did."
2,Where did the plot go?,"I have been a great fan of Anita Blake up until Narcissus in Chains. Sex, blood and violence are great plot movers. However, since Obsidian Butterfly, that's all there is! The plot is drowning in it! I do not agree that the ""ardeur"" is a good thing. It's like an addiction to cigarettes or alcohol; it only weakens Anita by making her a slave to it. [...]"
2,Please..........,Give it a rest. I'm so moving on fror LKH. And she obviously doesnt care about her fan base.
4,like anne rice on acid. and possibly E. as well.,"Yeah. I admit it. The sex is a bit much. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable as all hell..but if you're squeamish or straight laced...this is definatly not the book for you. Having said that, you have to admit it. Cerulean Sins is a really fun read. This was actually the first Anita Blake book I read (I'm working my way through the series backwards) and even as a first time reader I got completely sucked in. What is it about the bad boys...Whatever it is, Anitas boys have got it in spades, and Laurell Hamilton definatly does them justice. In addition, it's a good book. It has a smart, involved plot, good charector development, and atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere. You're either gonna love it or hate it, so unless you're a confirmed Anita Blake fan, borrow it first."
3,Totally Disapointed,"As a huge fan of the Anita Blake series, I was disapointed to find that Cerulean Sins just wasn't that good. The plot was weak and riddled with loose ends. The characters did not move forward as they have done in previous books. Some of the best characters were mentioned very briefly or not at all. ... Although thankfully Richard had a very small role in this book, his chronic depression and unhappiness are getting old. I found myself wishing Anita would just [destroy] him and put him out of his misery. This book reads like a set-up for the next one, which is a shame, since all of the other books have had enough material to stand alone. Here's hoping that Ms. Hamilton gets back on track with the next one."
1,Hamilton's Lost it...,How much can you flog the same formula and get away with it. This book is the same as the last four books of the anita blake series. It starts the same way and ends the same way. It has the same soft pornographic content all through. It potray's a really wrong role model in Anita - who though a hard nut and very independent has no morality and a twisted sense of everything.
3,What is happening to our favorite vamp hunter?,"I don't have any problems with Anita's sex life, but where was the story? NIC was kind of lost until the ending which was great. This story doesn't even have that. If you so love the series (and Asher) buy the book, but you might want to wait until the paperback"
1,Tasteless,"I was really excited to read this book. I heard rave reviews of the Anita Blake books and Cerulean Sins sounded really intriguing. However I was sorely disappointed to find this book pornographic!! I mean I'm not prude! I read Kim H. and I've even dabbled in Highlander books but OMG it was an atrocity!Some of the plot and mystery to the book were passable, and LKH needs to continue on that route. But the sex scenes were ridiculous and tasteless. LKH made up excuses to have Anita have sex with anyone in the book! And a threesome? AND a power that heightens your sex drive 800%? Look. Anita Blake has promise, has a future. But not if you sell her out to every waiting, ""pulsating"" penis.I'm disappointed. I've vowed after this book to never read a LKH book again. And I warn my friends with similar interests away from the series unless they are interested in porn.:|"
2,Bearable,"After the shocking change of the mood and complete destruction of the series in ""Narcissus in Chains"", this book was somewhat bearable. There is a story to follow (weak but better than the previous one), there is a crime scene and even though Dolph has gone completely mental, he is included in the story.Unfortunately Anita is still jumping everything that has a pulse, and each scene takes up pages and pages *yawn*. Everything seems to be only about sex, and it is really tiresome. The crimes, whatever is happening outside the bedroom walls, seem to have no importance. They are just there .... Quite sad !!!The book is not awful (very close though) and it's not good either. Just .... bearable !!!"
1,Just Awful,"Cerulean Sins is the latest novel in a series about a vampire executioner named Anita Blake. This story focuses on Anita's romantic entanglements, with a few small subplots thrown in--namely, a murder mystery and the threat of a very powerful vampire coming to town.This book is so badly written, it was a chore to read it.The writing is sloppy, tedious, badly edited, and confusing.Ditto for the plot.Ditto for the characters.The book is mired in convenient plot devices and tired and uninspiring sex scenes.There is no suspense in the book, despite its mystery/horror angle.Bottom line: this book contains no redeemable qualities at all, unless you're looking for a book filled with sex scenes. Then CS *might* be worth your while. Other than that? Leave this book well alone, unless you're planning on using it for a doorstop."
3,not near as good as earlier books,"ok, so let me start by saying i LOVE the earlier novels. however, this one and some of the ones behind it are up to LKH normal standards. i probably would have given this 2 stars if it wasn't for how much i love the series and keep hoping that it will rebound.what was wrong with the book? well the biggest thing is the indiscriminate sex... lots and lots of meaningless sex. the plot revolves around anita and her uncontrolable impulses. there is little to the mystery. that is my main gripe with the book. i miss the suspense and mystery and actual plot. to be honest if this was the first of her books i picked up i wouldn't read any more of them.however, it is still a decent book, mostly well written. i love jason, and like anita and richard and other main characters less and less. i hope that LKH returns to what made this series so popular, and it wasn't the sex. (her first book in the series has absolutely no sex, believe it or not)"
3,endless Ardeur,"sorry but i am so disappointed by this one. i like the sex as much as the next gal but how about some plot besides anita orgasming/spasming, biting, and all the rest of it (while her males look on in horror/hope/abandonement/confusion)? too much torpor, too much succubi feasting--it's boring! where's anita who kicks butt with the best of them? where's anita with moral boundaries she draws quite firmly in the sand? all gone to the flaccid battle with Belle and the ardeur. snooooore........."
1,Series started great but now ....,"The Anita Blake of the first few books is gone and seemingly not returning. If you like vampire romance novels this may be a good book. If you like vampire mystery, it most definitely is not.I'll not buy another book in the series unless there is some indication that Anita is going back to her roots."
4,Awesome series,"I have loved this series from the beginning and enjoy how much the characters have grwon and changed. However, if you haven't read the series, do not start with this one. They need to be read in order.That said, Anita Blake and friends are about to have the ""honor"" of a visit by a representative of the vampire council. Right from the start things go wrong and they are only complicated by the consequences of Anita's acceptance of being bonded to a master vampire and an alpha werewolf.I would give all the other books in this series five stars. However, this one only got four as there were several continuity errors that disrupted the flow of the story when they cropped up. Aside from those errors, this was a fast read, engrossing, and a great addition to the series. I can hardly wait for the next one!"
2,most boring,"I bought this for my husband as him and some of the other soliders he is working with have been reading this whole series while in Iraq. He has said this is the worst of the seris, a snoozer."
3,Nice read :),"OK, unlike most on here I wont bash the Author, but it cannot be denied this series has taken a downwards turn. I loved the first 9 books....only thing missing was quite frankly more BEDROOM action, it needed some HEAT, as I wished for that I had no idea that when it came the plot would suffer so greatly.I was and I still am so tired of Anita's whinning and ""so-called morals? She is practically a slut now! A judgemental unfair one and inconsiderate to the men in her life oh and Richard ? I dont know if I hate him or just feel bad for him...lol that being said I still love her and her world...but I plan to sell books 1-14, and get the rest from the library. Dont know what to say I love her but its ""just"" not a keeper this series. Maybe I will use the money on Buffy TVS series lol"
5,Freakin' Fantabulous,"Good Golly Miss Molly, may I just say I loved this book. Be snarky, be a snob, be a prude, be whatever you want, but don't deny that there are some wonderful scenes in this book. I personally happened to love much of the dialoge, and thought there were some great personal developments with the characters. Get off your high horses people. There were touching moments, moments that had you swearing, and moments that were laugh out loud funny. I loved the character interaction, it flowed, and showed new dimensions to character personalities.I think this book excellently sets up future plot turning points and twists, not just for the next book, but in whole scheme of the Anitaverse. It's really hard not to write spoilerish things, so all I can write is: be prepared for the not-so-expected. (what you thought I'd say unexpected? By now I know better than to assume what can or won't happen).Happy readings. rock on."
2,A weak effort from a formerly great author.,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the Anita Blake series, but I feel like Ms Hamilton has lost the plot (and the characters) in exchange for more sex and sensationalism. In addition, there's a lot of repetition of sentences lifted directly from earlier books which is boring. Her prose seems to have gone down the tubes compared to the punch-packing flow of the earlier stories. The last great book in this series was Obsidian Butterfly, but if you must read this I'd say check it out from the library and save yourself the cash. You'll be glad you did."
1,ZERO STARS,"I'm disappointed that I couldn't put in ZERO because this book doesn't even deserve 1 star. I am so disappointed in this series. She should really stop and I am so sick and tired of this ""ardeur"" in these books. It's amazing that she continues to use it as much as she has. I say enough is enough. Put Anita out of her misery. I say give Edward his own series. He is a killing machine with his own rules. Anita has become a ridiculous character and I am moving on. Poor Jean-Claude and Richard. I can't continue to support a series that continues to destroy what was once a very exciting premise. What are the problems? Several but mostly, the mystery is missing and the days of waiting for a new book are gone. Good luck to you Ms. Hamilton."
1,Ugh ... another book burning please ...,"I thought book 10, NIC, was an anomaly ...NOPE, shear suckage. If you didn't like 10, don't bother with anything else.The author continues to trash this series, we have the Vampire Humper meets the Hardback Whore. Kinda reminds me of some concerts when the the guitarist smashes his instrument at the end of the concert ... you know that thing will never whisper, or scream, a sweet note again. Yep, that is the fate of Anita Blake, nothing worthwhile will every be produced again.What a pity.I strongly recommend you try something by any of the following authors instead: Charlaine Harris (I love her Shakespeare series), Jim Butcher, Wen Spencer, Patricia Briggs, Rebecca Bradley, Lilith Saintcrow, Rob Thurman, Tanya Huff, Lois McMasters Bujold.Life's too short to read crap.RIP Anita Blake."
4,another great book,I began reading this series by accidentally starting with book 16. I loved it so I began reading from the first. I love this series and Anita makes one interesting lead character!! If u like romance with a little action and a lot of sex...this is ur book!
1,no,this was bad! like crossing the streams bad! really turned me off. i don't know what the hell happened to this series but it's turned into a train wreck. i don't have the constitution to keep trudging through these books hoping they'll get better.
1,End the SERIES!!!!,"After Narc. in Chains I was reluctant to buy another Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Book, but figured I'd give LKH the benefit of having at least 1 bad book. I should have stayed with my instincts and left this book on the shelf, I was happy to give my copy away to get it out of my sight.Put Anita Blake out of her misery, the series is dragging on with no end in sight and no plot or character development worth reading.The introduction of new characters has not been well thought out, new the characters are not very well written or very interesting.LKH's Publisher should put a stake through the next novel and kill the series."
1,CAN ANITA'S EGO GET ANY BIGGER?,"If this series keeps on as it is, Anita's ego is going to have to have its own book. To be so short, she spends half of her time bossing people around. Her sex drive has gotten to stupid levels, she will almost do it anywhere with anybody. I am still trying to understand why Micah (one of anita's many boyfriends) was added to the cast. He just another one of the many yes men in Anita's world. In the beginning this book was so dry that i had to force myself to read it. In the end I was angry that i had. The plot was too predicable and too packed, there was too many crisis's happening at the same time to really be able to enjoy the book. If you want a good read, read the Southern vampire series, it is delightful."
5,ahhhhhhhh,"LKH does it again. Thank goodness for an author who can consistenly put out interesting books, each with a new spin. Lately it seems that authors with series just keep spitting out the same book over and over again.Of course, even if it was the same book over and over again, the main character would make it worthwhile, she's a necromancer and succubus with a leopard beast inside her. How awesome is that!!"
2,Over-reliance on spell checker - ERRORS!,"The story - ho hum.As a confirmed English geek, I just could not help picking up my red pencil and correcting spell-checking errors! At least, I HOPE they were spell-checking errors and not errors in usage. Either way, these issues should have been caught during proofing and editing: scene/seen, born/borne, etc."
2,Disappointed in the direction,"I only recently found Anita Blake and have eagerly devoured the first 10 books. I loved the character of Anita, very real and true to life...until now. With this book it seems as though Anita has transformed from a person with some type of standards and some type of line she won't cross, to one who has nothing at all to stand on. How does one go from being with one man in her lifetime to 5 or more sex partners with one session being four men at a time? I would think a transitional period would be in here somewhere. I feel as though the author went through some sexual transformation and instead of taking Anita along, just jumped to the end. So we have the good Anita and the naughty Anita. No in between.I doubt that I will finish this series now. I just don't think it will be worth my time anymore."
3,I hope it does not get any worse then this,Well I have all the books for this series and all I can think of is how far the series has sunk.From the start the series was excellant with a great storyline but the last 3 books have been for the most part trashy sex novels.While this novel was a bit better then the last two I will NOT be buying the next book in this series until I read it from the library as my money is limited and I cannot and will not waste it on a bad book or a series that has become bad.To the author I say this.Get back to writing the story and bring back the mystery but please stop using the sex as filler.If you are having problems getting to the x number of words you are supposed to have for the novel then take a break and delay it for a year or two. I would rather have a novel of the past quality I know you can do rather then a roll of toilet paper that most of the last 3 books for the series have been.
2,"Ummm, Rewrite Please!","Ok, I love Hamilton's books. Her creativity is boundless, and her characters fly off the pages. But this book was so one-dimentional and I was really dissapointed. I gave it two stars because even though it's kind of a let-down, it still manages to nudge the story along and you should read it if you want to keep up with the series. But it's a total ""filler"" book. There is tooooo much pointless sex, (most of which is totally pointless to the story). Enough with the ARDEUR crap! If Hamilton wants to write porn, she should just get on with that. And don't get me wrong, I totally love good sex scenes, but in this book they took over to the detriment of a decent story line. Hamilton's signature preternatural crime hook suffered badly here, becoming almost an afterthought to the Anita's being in constant heat. I mean phleaz! Get the woman a vibrator already...."
1,"More plot, less porn",I like a good sex/romance scene as much as anyone but I also like a story to go with it. The so-called plot of this book seemed thrown together around Anita's ever-widing pool of sex partners. I was very disappointed in this latest book. I hope that LKH gets her heroine and her storyline back on track soon.
2,Cerulean Nightmare!!!,"This is the second offering by Hamilton I've read...I will admit the first offering I read was her short story included in Cravings-I was simply awful. Cerulean Sins was my attempt to give the author a second chance to come up to snuff (several people suggested I read some of Hamilton's work). Well, it took nearly 2 hours to read 82 pages...the reading was slow, silly, and boring. I thought the heroine (read whinny Anita) was just a spoiled-I-want-everything-my-way brat. How could powerful master vampires put up with that kind of stuff??I would advise the author to exercise rewriting her stories before she sends them to the publisher...200 hundred of the 500+ pages were not needed."
5,I will definitely read all of this series....,"I found that what I have read so far, that this is a really great book. I can't seem to be able to put it down. I have read all the books leading up to this one and it just keeps me wanting more."
3,Missing the old,"I started reading the Anita Blake series sometime ago and instantly loved it. It got to the point where I ordered three books at once because I knew I'd be reading them in a day. Well once I got to Obsidian Butterfly I couldn't get past the third chapter. I also skipped Narcissus in Chains, but thought to give cerulean sins a try.Needless to say I was disappointed. If I wanted an eratic adventure I'd rent a movie from the little back room at the video store. I find myself missing the old Anita. The new one kicks less...and has more sex. Where's the raw action?The other thing that put me off was all the details. It took almost two pages just to tell me what two characters were wearing. I don't care much about the clothes! I want to see guns slingin' and mouths shooting! But Anita doesn't do any of these things anymore. She just has sex, with several men at that!Give me the old books, get ride of this new [stuff]."
4,Great Book...but...,Normally I love lots of erotica but I think this books really went overboard on it BUT I still love the book.I would like to see Anitas character develop more though in future books in way if any powers she has.Great book though and I highly recommend reading and/or buying
1,Hamilton has gone downhill.,This book has no plot. It is solely written as a device to get Anita into lots of sexual situations and be naked.
2,It hurts me to do this!,"I've been in love with LKH's writing for a decade now, and it grieves me to part with her, but part with her I must. What began as an awesome series staring a wonderfully tough but ethical herione infused with sarcasm has evolved into someone with about as much depth as a porno-movie plot. I've stayed with her two books longer than I should have. I'm jumping ship to Charlaine Harris, anybody want to join me in the life boat???"
2,Good Grief,I have read and loved all the Anita Blake novels. I have always liked Anita's moral conumdrums and the fact that there were no neat answers. I enjoyed watching her raise a graveyard of zombies. I liked her physically tough and emotionally unsure personality. She was true to her friends both human and monster. But is there a solid story line here?? I could not discern one. She seems to run from raping and using the people who depend on her to behaving like a mean spirited slut. The are no new issues in this book. Everything is recycled and tied together with so much sex I am surprised that Miss Blake can still walk. Can we PLEASE get our old heroine back?
2,I was disappointed,"I can't remember what book in the series I was on when I stopped reading it, but I remember I stopped when the plot and characters went down the toilet, and it was all just sex, sex, sex, and more sex. I don't get into romance novels much because that's all they're usually about. No really good plot to keep you turning the pages in them. Unfortunatly, that's how this series ended up, a really trashy erotica novel full of sex with strange men and that's all.A previous poster said something about her ""ardeur"". I remember when Anita would get this, but then it turned into just an excuse for Miss Hamilton to write a few more pages about having to have sex with some other strange guy (maybe two at once) because the ""ardeur"" flared up again...and again....and again....and again. It's sad really, the direction this series went."
3,Somewhat disappointed!,"After following this series for so long I gotta tell you, I was somewhat disappointed with this installment. The ending didn't set well with me, I'm sorry to say. Usually, a fan of Ms. Hamilton, I hate to say this but if I were you, I'd check this one out at the library or borrow it from a friend. Hopefully, my faith in Ms. hamilton will be restored with her next book!"
4,From a New Fan,"I had never read anything by Hamilton until Cerulean Sins. I was surprised to find in was more centered around sex than mystery, crime, and suspense. Although more than half of the book dealt with Blake's sex life and the mating habits of preternatural creatures, what remained was very well thought out and tied together from beginning to end. Keep in mind though, this is not an action packed book. You aren't going to find any great fight scenes, but you will find blood and conflict."
1,Ugh,"Is Ms. Hamilton just phoning it in, now? I used to enjoy this series, but turning Anita into a nymphomaniac has made her boring. She used to be a kick-butt heroine. She's given up kicking the butts for...never mind.What ever happened to plot? To character development? I like sex as much as the next person, but page after page after page of two-somes, three-somes and more-somes gets monotonous. This isn't even hot sex, since most of the characters are one-dimensional nonentities.The only person who could enjoy this junk is a randy adolescent. It's a brief step up from the Penthouse forum."
1,End of an Era,"I started out a huge fan of this series. Many fans of LKH left or became disgusted with the turn this series took after Narcissus in Chains, but this one was the straw that broke this camel's back. Where there was once a dynamic plotline rife with action, drama, diverse and interesting characters......it became an ill-conceived series of pointless sex, zero plot, and disappearing personalities. I, as of yet, have not picked up the latest book and don't plan to based on what I've heard of it. I'm personally relying on a friend of mine that has stuck with the series to let me know when it's safe to pick up another one of these books because I refuse to do so on my own. As of yet, she has told me not to bother. How anyone who claims to be a fan of this series can say that the latest 3 books are even nearly on par with the rest is beyond me."
2,getting worse...,"I started out absolutely loving and looking forward to Anita Blake...I was downloading and reading three books a week....Then I hit a brick wall with Obsidian Butterfly and it's gotten worse through and including Cerulean Sins. I think the books went from paranormal mystery, to paranormal romance and have hit on paranormal EROTICA.... taken a turn for the unbelievable...nothing is Anita - Necromancer and Vampire Executioner...it's mostly who will Anita screw and or think about killing...I mean how many more ""most powerful"" vampires can there be...I'm all for a good romp, but with multiple people at the same time and within hours of eachother...the series has lost my interest....not sure I will waste any more money and it saddens me...."
2,Hope this trend in the series doesn't continue,"I've been reading the Anita Blake series since the very first book and have always looked forward to the next in the series. This book, however, has really disappointed me. It was basically 500 pages of vampire politics and the main character's internal conflict of should she or should she not have sexual relations with multiple guys. The usual action-packed, crime-solving, tough heroine I always loved was no where to be found. The inner workings of her vampire world may be fascinating to the author, but 500 pages of it is way too much for me.This is NOT typical of the series and I hope Ms. Hamilton gets her character back on track, for I would hate to see the loss of an overall very good vampire series.I'll give her next book a try when it comes out on paperback. But if this new trend continues, I won't continue to buy her books."
4,Not the best,"But it certainly was better than the waiting period until the next book came out. Although I must say, it could have been polished a little. And the ending was something of a flop to be brutally honest. But overall, this book was still enjoyable. The beginning started out just like any other of her great books, yet something was missing. It was hard to pin down, but the missing link (so to speak) to this being a great read was simply that the entire affair seemed a bit rushed; like Hamilton had a deadline to meet, and didn't have time to nurture the plot into something spectacular."
1,Can I give minus stars?,"My word, what a tedious book. I've read the other Hamilton books and, while they've had their problems (grammar, LKH, please learn grammar), they've been enjoyable for their humor and subject. But this one is by far the weakest she's cranked out. Whining is not character development, and neither is sex.Also, whatever you do, avoid the audio version of this book. I have a long commute and listen to a lot of audiobooks, but I've never heard such a horrible reader as the one who reads this book. No real attempt at character voices (or, most likely, no ability to do them) and the worst french accent I've ever heard. Avoid her like the plague!"
1,"""Penthouse"" for zombies","It is very unusual for a popular series to take a free-fall like this one has (think: Charlaine Harris's ""Sookie Stackhouse"" series). I, like many other formerly devoted readers of ""Anita Blake,"" don't understand why the author would take such a sucessful franchise in such an odd (soft-porn) direction. I can only imagine that LH became bored after completing book #9 in the series, yet perhaps had a contract to ""chug out"" 15 books or so, and thus, decided to toss plot and characters to the winds in favor of ""Playboy for supes""....very sad, as her reputation is suffering. Not worth the effort to read, nor the trees that died in order to publish this drivel."
1,Series is going downhill fast,"This series started out so well. It had mystery, horror, and suspense to keep readers wanting to read more. Sadly, it has now gone downhill and in the gutter. The suspense and mystery has been replaced with soft porn and erotica. I'm really tired of reading about how long and lustrous someone's hair is or how Anita can't keep from wanting to tear someone's clothes off. I kept hoping the series would get back to its roots but each book has been worse than the one before lately. Sadly I will not be reading anymore as I've had enough. If I wanted to read erotica I would be looking for that. I however like suspense, mystery, and horror and this is none of those to me anymore"
3,More of the same.,"I mindlessly read the entire book before I realized that it's just covering more of the same territory as the previous books. I think Obsidian Butterfly was the last one that I really enjoyed.There's no longer any suspense. All of her books involve a bad guy/guys who Anita triumphs over in the end. During the course of all of the books people/creatures are going to die and/or be tortured, some of them may even be Anita's ""friends/soldiers/sex partners"". The difference with the later books is that it's become difficult to feel any empathy for the characters, especially since they are all seen from Anita's increasingly twisted point-of-view."
3,Rated X,"Hamilton is at the top of her form in terms of what she does best -- staged sex on command. Poor, poor Anita Blake is forced by the demands of her magic to sate her appetite frequently and in all sorts of combinations. I'm not against that particularly, but it really gets to be repetitive and predictable."
4,unexpected charge $23,"When I checked out with my credit card, it was $68 for one DVD The Art of Zen Shiatsu. Afterwards I found the charge was around $91 from my credit card account. Definitely if I had known I had to spend $91 for one DVD, I would have not purchased it. The hidden charge was disturbing."
5,"The No-Ssalt, Lowest-sodium Light Meals Book","As I have kidney failure and my diet is so limited I've been buying lots of lo salt cookbooks. Most books are uninspiring. This book has promise. One simple recipe was tasty and good, and those are qualities I miss terribly. I'll continue trying the recipes that use ingredients that my diet permits."
1,"no help on recipies to cut salt, especially regular menues. not many people have venison, squirrel, etc to make the meals","I was very disappointed in this book. Hoping that it would contain some decent recipies that I could use, instead the recipies were of wild game that I do not have, want or will eat!!!! This is the real world and knowing how to eat with less salt and some ingredients that are simple and what normal people use everyday."
3,low-salt recipe book,"The book was in very good condtion, however, I don't know how much I'll use it. The recipes call for too many unusual ingredients that I don't have on hand."
5,taste great,I bought this book to help cook for my father who has congestive heart failure and requires a low sodium diet.I was surprised how good these recipes are and bought another copy for myself. Very impressed.
4,Irish cottage,This little cottage is added to my collection. It is really very detailed and perfectly finished. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
4,The Controller!,"With a blastgate at each machine, you can control the air flow from the DC unit as if you only had one machine hooked up, providing the most efficient use of the air suction. By opening and closing each blastgate, as needed, you will get the maximum amount of air flow at all times.For a more ""durable"" blastgate, there is a metal version available at a premium. But I have found the plastic gates work just fine for most operations. The only negative item for this blastgate, and even the metal blastgates, WHY are the ends tapered? All the other fittings for the DC system do not have tapered ends, only the blastgates.Overall, it is a good product that allows for maximum use of a dust collection system, with a blastgate installed at each branch to control the air flow to the machine in use."
5,Great coffee table book,"Fantastic, luxurious book. Great gift for dad's and boys who like expensive toys!"
2,Too Different from Traditional Chant Music,"Although I have not even heard the entire length of each song, just judging by the samples heard, they are modernized versions of Gregorian Chant music. And I find them straying way too much from the traditional versions of this genre. I much prefer hearing only voices in the background, without any electronic-like instruments or sounds added to it. Just as classical music should not be ""modernized"" by accompanying it with so many synthesizer or electronic guitar-like sounds, so should Gregorian Chant music be left alone."
5,The Grand Masters!!,This album is simply enchanting.... true they chant music that has been made famous by other artists... bt what captivates me is the sound... its dark!!!They are simply wonderful!!!
5,The first and still the best,The first release for Gregorian: Masters of Chant and still the best of the series I've listened to. They hit the right notes with old favourites and classics.
5,Great band,"[...] Bomb Factory's music is really good, especially and surprisingly in their lyrics (they sing in English, but it's not their first language). The ideas behind it are what you might expect from a punk rock band, but it's the sound that gets me. Really crunchy guitars, impossible licks, a lot of distortion, and a ton of energy. Check out their MySpace page or YouTube for their material.And yes, the first track is the same as from the game Dead or Alive 2 on Dreamcast (how I first heard of them) but this album version has an extended part not included in the game (makes it better)."
4,"Well constructed whydunit, but....","Maybe I was influenced by the mildly repugnant paperback cover of the 1965 edition I first read, but I still have a memory that this mystery has an unpleasant air about it. It's biggest puzzle is what connects the victims that are being strangled by a serial killer.I wonder why Anthony Boucher picked this as one of the 5 books in the ""World's Great Novels of Detection."" Obviously he felt compelled to include a Queen title, and maybe others were unavailble to the publisher, or more often printed. I read it on his ""advice,"" and while not bad, I guess i was disappointed when it didn't match his other choices, which remain to this day - 40 years later - books I read over and over."
4,Not her best but still an excellent read,"I am a big Jilly Cooper fan and was very excited to see a new book out. I found it to be a really good read and was pleased to see that Tabitha Campbell-Black was one of the main characters. It was a bit different to the others, as the second half was a murder mystery. While the killer was obvious to me pretty early on, I still found it quite scary near the end. The only thing that was disappointing was that so much time was spent on the exploits of the secondary characters and not enough on the romances between the main characters, Lucy, Tristan, Tabitha etc. However, it was still a great read. I hear her next book will be set in the art world and feature Rupert's brother. I hope it won't be too long before it's finished!"
3,Hmm nice try,"Well I've read just about every Jilly Cooper book going (sad, I know). And I'm afraid that this one simply doesn't cut it. The heroes and heroines are as racy as ever, but the plot is frankly as lame as an overplayed polo pony, and the villain isn't up to much either. Still it's good and you want to stay up all night reading it (I did, anyhow). But you know what, ""Riders"" or ""Rivals"" or better yet ""Polo"" are just SO much better."
2,We all missed the big funeral,"Like the previous reviewers am I a big Jilly Cooper fan and have read all the books from riders up until this Score.I think in this one is simple a big mistake and I wonder why a good editor didn't attend Jilly Cooper at it.After Ranaldini was killed nobody thought one second about the body. It was brought to the morgue and that was that.It is very unlikely that the family ( Helen, Wolfie )were not occupied with organizing the funeral.It is very unlikely that Hermione didn't see any role for her on the funeral.It is very unlikely that the inhabitants of the book were not fighting over their places at the ceremony.It is very unlikely that a man as famous as Ranaldini did not get a big enormous funeral with at least Royal attention.It is very 'jammer' that we readers don't get anything from the funeral. It must have been really something!It made the book for me rather weak.Kind regards, Henny Jellema ( Netherlands)"
2,Not as good as the other Rutshire Chronicles,"I have devoured the other ""Rutshire"" books by Jilly Cooper and would rate them all as five stars, however I am disappointed by the lack of character development in ""Score!"" I note from reading the author's note at the back that Jilly Cooper was asked to cut back on the length of the book, I assume this is the reason that characterisation which is usually so superb, is stifled. Lucy, for example, is developed only as much as a very secondary character would have been in the earlier novels. I was also disappointed that Jilly, as an animal lover, would include a scene such as that which occurred at Rannaldini's death - this ruined the book for me to some extent - but then I'm a squemish vegetarian! I look forward to Jilly's next novel, and hope the publishers don't intervene again!!!"
4,Enjoying every minute!,"This is my first attempt at reading Jilly Cooper. This was a trade-in at a second-hand book store, and at first I was daunted by the size of the book. The first couple of chapters did not excite me all that much, but I found myself slowly, but surely getting engrossed with every page. I can't comment on whether or not the plots, storylines or characters are believable, but I can say without hesitation that this has been an enjoyable read (and I'm not even through with it!). There have been moments when I literally laughed out loud! I'm looking forward to reading more of Ms. Cooper's work."
3,Not Jilly's best,"Jilly Cooper writes her first murder mystery. Maestro conductor Roberto Rannaldini, dark anti-hero of 2 previous novels cops it while making a film. The problem is to find the killer among the myriad of enemies he has made over the years. Some old favourites from previous books number among the suspects. Rupert Campbell Black is here as is his wayward daughter Tabitha. There is the usual Cooper scenario of bonking, boozing and stories of star crossed lovers as well as many insights into the worlds of film making and classical music. The cast of characters is huge but disappointingly none of them seem to be well developed enough to love or loathe by the end of the book. Its a mystery that the heroine, Lucy Latimer, a nice dog loving make up artist ever gets anyone to fall in love with her by book's end. I love Jilly's books and would never miss out on one but this has certainly been a disappointment."
3,Don Whillans: portrait of a mountaineer - revisted,"I am fortunate to own an original, autographed edition of this book. I have been re-reading it, probabley for the first time in almost twenty years. It is still a very enjoyable book. The narrative,by co-author Alick Ormerod, interspersed with Don's own words makes the story always interesting.Unfortunately the book finishes with a brief mention of Don's triumph on Annapurna in the early '70's and there is nothing to bring it up to date until his early death in the '80's.The book gives an enthralling glimpse into the Whillans-Brown partnership of the 1950's. Not to be missed by anyone interested in British climbing and maountaineering."
1,How misleading!,"Nichols is trying to convince professional customers that it is the Chilton Company, and that is just not so,"" ""It is falsely claiming to be the `World's Original Automotive Repair Company' and `founded in 1922' when in fact Nichols has been in the industry for only a few years. While Nichols did acquire certain Chilton assets associated with the publication of do-it-yourself books, assets of Chilton's Professional Division were acquired by Motor, including copyrights in the original Chilton times published over the years in Chilton's Labor Guides"
1,No factory times and MISSING pages,As a service tech I found this book to be totally useless. It had no Factory Times for comparison and several of the indexes were missing. When I tried to contact whoever is printing this book Nichols/Chilton about an incorrect time I was put on hold for 1/2 an hour. I quickly hung up and called MOTOR and got the correct time.
4,Dependable Chilton Information,I have reviewed this book and found it to be as reliable as the old Chilton Labor Guide. It's quite obvious that most of the reviews about chilton's new line of books are written by thier compeditors. The truth is that the information is as dependable as it always was. I have found out that the core employees at W.C. Nichols are the same ones that have been producing Chilton books for the last 20 or so years. My advise is to preview the books at the library before your purchase if you have any doubts. You may end up saving a lot of money by purchasing a new Nichols/Chilton book.
3,Fluff...,"How can one not like a book with such a lofty purpose--to teach the craft of living, expecially when it evokes an image of Martha Stewart in the Egyptian tombs? Perhaps, it's not a dislike I'm trying to avoid but, rather, a suspicion of vacuousness. What is alarming, given the book's brevity, is that if the quotes and the metaphors were eliminated, the length would be decimated. To quote Emerson from his Journal of May, 1849, ""I hate quotations. Tell me what you know."" Metaphors are like grains of salt--a few are good; too many are ruinous. The author has crossed the ambit into brackishness. The metaphor of the facets of life as projects is especially labored. I'm sure my wife would bristle at being designated as one of my projects--many of which lie in bits and pieces in the basement. The use of a length of string to represent history and then identifying temporal events as a distance from one end is a cliche. Sorry, I don't get it."
2,"Okay, but not their best.","Die Prinzen are known for their ingenious lyrics, and this album has some of that. But here they seem to be lost; they seem not to know if they should be a rock band or primarily a group where choral singing has more prominence. The result is an album that sounds more angry than one might expect; so it's not as much fun to listen to."
2,Missing info,"I bought this book for a trip I'm planning to Budapest, and unfortunately, while advertised as being a part of the book, my copy does not have the information on Budapest. I'll add it to my library of travel guides, as I will probably visit Austria and/or Switzerland at some point and the information will be useful. Also, I am a big fan of Let's Go guidebooks anyway, as the writing style and wealth of contact information make travel planning easy. I just wish the Budapest, Prague and Munich info had been included."
4,How American corporations sell you junk,"It has been years since I read this book, but its message is very timely. It deals with the strategy of companies to manufacture goods that wear out or break down so they need to be replaced. As I recall it deals heavily with the automobile industry. But in truth, the US auto industry could not hold a candle to the computer and software industry of today. This is also true of many other consumer goods. GDP is literally a measure of our garbage! Waste Makers is worth a read."
1,Dubious advertising and sales conduct.,"The item was advertised as the complete work comprising two volumes. Only one volume was dispatched by the seller. When questioned about this, the seller apologised, stating that only one volume was actually available, and offered to refund a reasonable amount. No such refund was ever forthcoming. A lone volume of this work is largely useless. This transaction was far from satisfactory."
3,Not for the average person,"Briefly, this book is definitely a recap of what you see over a year of Iron Man magazines. But let's face it...has the bench press chnaged at all in 30 years? Info like this is repetitive because of that reason. This book does a great job of going over the same material everyone has.Does this book offer anything that other advanced levels books have not? No.My only warning is this - if you are not the truly serious, dyed in the wool, hardcore, highly motivated, ready to die before quitting type that wants to become a massive and true competition style bodybuilder...this book will not be for you."
3,Good deal of useful information,"Though crippled by mediocre photography, this bound compilation of Ironman magazine articles has some pretty useful workout plans and suggestions, much of which is actually geared toward natural bodybuilders (unlike many of the workout magazines that currently cram store shelves).Some of the ""hardgainer"" based information is very useful, and any book that includes an article by Stuart McRobert has got to be worth something! (check out McRobert's Brawn and Beyond Brawn for EXCELLENT information on natural bodybuilding for typical trainees).Overall, a very informative read. Check out especially chapters 3, 5, 7 and 8."
5,Good value,I bought the biggest size so that we could dispense this among family members. We decanted into smaller brown glass dropper vials to use when we travel. We are also using it to treat skin conditions and to take internally. So far it seems to be effective.
3,"Nice player, but poor performance in the vehicle","I purchased this DVD player for a family road trip. Given that the sole reason I purchased it was so that my children could watch DVDs in the car, I have been somewhat disappointed. The power supply jack is loose, so the DVD player occasionally turns off while operating. This, of course is not received well by the children. Additionally, the headphone jacks are loose causing intermittent audio. Given that this unit comes with a case for securing it to a vehicle head rest, it certainly does NOT seem to have been designed with vehicle vibration in mind. It seems that the vehicle mounting was an afterthought, rather than designed in. I'm sure it is a great player when stationary, but not in motion."
3,RCA DVD Player,"Disappointed, right out of the box, player would only play 5 minutes on the plug in, had to use the batteries/ seems odd? On the second day of use, the plug became stuck and broke off, rendering it useless, now only the battery works. The sound is very low also, but the picture is clear."
1,"Bad quality, the CD reader stoped working","Al principio estuvo funcionando muy bien, pero después de unos meses, empecé a notar que las películas tenían de repente un salto en la película o un ruido raro en el audio. Al principio pensé que era el CD que estaba rayado, pero esto se repitió con todos los CDs, cada vez más hasta que ya no volvió a leer ningún CD. De hecho, ya no me sirve nada... Creo que funcionó lo suficiente para que expirara la garantía con el proveedor... así que para mi es muy mala calidad porque la idea es que siga sirviendo por años y no solo justo lo necesario para que ya no tengan que cambiarlo... En verdad, No lo recomiendo.It was working fine for the first months, actually long enough to get the warranty expired, and then it strated to fail reading the CDs until it didnt worked any more. Not recommended."
5,Excellent Player,"I would highly reccommend getting this player. First of all, it is very high quality. I have owned it for several months and havn't had a single problem with it. I previously owned a Magnavox portable player that had horrible overheating problems, I have used this for several hours in a row and it has never overheated. Also, the screen has a very good picture. This player also comes with several handy accessories. Such as a car charger, an AC adapter, a remote that is easy to use, a carrying case, and a battery. I would definitely reccommend this player over any others because it is a great buy. You get a great quality DVD player for a good price."
5,Great out of the box,"I just purchased this to use with my toddler on long car trips. So far, it's fantastic. It's a nice, small unit, and quite light without the battery (which easily detaches if you don't need it). The speakers have the capability to be very loud, and the sound quality is acceptable (though not great). The player came with a nice little case, which can be hooked over the back of car seat (though the information in the description doesn't say this). So...try that out before you buy a separate case.It was easy to use, and the picture quality is good, with very nice, bright colors. The resolution isn't great, but it's better than I expected. I'll come back once we've used it for a little while."
4,Great Picture,"I bought this for traveling with my two year old. I have owned it for a month and my daughter watches it almost every day. In the house, with hands on the screen (I left the film attached), knocking it off the arm of the couch and ottom and the thing still works great. The picture and sound quality are great. However, you will need to purchase a larger carrying case, for all of your goodies, becuase the one provided is only big enough for the dvd player. The case is used to attach to you car seat so it needs to have a snug fit and that it does. I highly recommed this product for adults or children. Another plus, this item actually comes with a manual, unlike some of the other RCA products. Good luck shopping."
5,MakeUp: The Art of Beauty by Linda Mason,"What a great make up book by a professional make up artist!!!!Linda Mason takes us behind the scenes at fashion shows and photo shoots and makes the reader feel like her friend & apprentice.The stories, the tips, lessons , photographs and hand done illustrations are all superb& informative. Whether you're a pro or just an interested party , when you put this book down, you'll feel like you can tackle makeup with a whole new perspective. I'll refer to this book again and again!!!a truly beautiful beauty book!!!"
2,Dated,"This book is absolutely dated. I was dissappointed by it. I realized the best part of it was the section on professional stage and photography makeup. The rest of it I found to show looks that are completely fake and obvious (such as contouring and applying blush in one diagonal stripe below the cheekbone), very eighties!!! If you are looking for a book on makeup which you can use to create everyday and special occassion (but natural) looks, this one is not for you. I much rather reccomend the Bobbi Brown or Sonia Kashuk."
2,Not impressed,"This is really a beginner text. Great for people who don't own any Kevin Aucoin books and who have never read an issue of Allure magazine in thier lives.It does have some interesting information on period makeup from the 1920's-1990's. A couple good techniques.On the whole I was pretty disappointed. Oh well, it was only $10"
2,Very Disappointing,"I saw the author on a morning talk show, and was very eager to read her makeup tips. But the book contains very little guidance on how to put on makeup. What little is said is so poorly written that it is almost incomprehensible, and the author does not offer any advice on specific makeup products or brands. Moreover, most of the book is devoted to advice on how to make a career out of doing others' makeup, and to details about the author's career--which are given in an almost ridiculously egotistical way, right down to referring to herself in the third person. I feel I wasted the money I spent on this book."
3,A bit of the strange and unusual,"I love makeup, Allure magazine (and others) and makeup books, so I decided to get this. I don't think this is in the same league as Kevyn Aucoin, but there is some interesting stuff in here. Some of the looks do seem a bit dated, and there seem to be more photos from the late 1970s and through the 1980s, so you have the colors and intense diagonal blush, etc. There are some interesting tips, such as applying blush in a vertical smudge to create length, etc., and while I'm not going to be applying fake gems to my eyebrows or painting a stripe of bronze down the side of my face any time soon, it's interesting to look into and read the book and see someone painting outside conventional lines. It's fun and worthwhile for that alone. A little bit of the avante garde never hurts."
3,"A good, quick read that captivates until the last page.","When Blister McCoy decides he needs a detective to locate a father he has never known, he lucks upon the best. Connor Gibbs, an amalgam of intelligence, quick wit, strong values, and the strength to defeat the bad guys, takes the case, getting more than he bargains for. Tracking a man on the lamb who is already sought by Jack Slade, nefarious bounty hunter, leads Gibbs up against the law as well as a family determined to protect their own and a sister-in-law who wants her nephew's father dead. But Gibbs goes the distance for the child who lost his mother to a drunk driver and soon wins the detective's heart. Fast-paced, this action packed novel takes your emotions on a roller coaster with just one more twist at the end."
2,Hummmmmmmmm...,"If you are looking for the original recordings as they were heard on the radio, well...this ain't the one! But if you want to hear what the other takes from these groups were like...get this one as it's not too bad in that sense.a Pisces Lady..."
4,another marvel from Holman,"Holman is not only a very good writer, she is a highly original and eclectic one. Her novels absorb, amaze and, in this instance, amuse. Each takes place in a dramatically different setting and tackle different ideas, but all are linked by Holman's uncanny voice and attention to telling detail. Go ahead, grab this book or any other Holman novel, and you'll embark on an unexpected and enlightening ride that left this reader marveling about Holman's imagination and breath of knowledge."
3,Interesting characters; unbelievable events,"This is a good read, but I wouldn't go as far as ""couldn't put it down."" The themes of separation, survival, growing up, growing old, and love in all its strange forms are all interwined into an interesting yet at times almost silly story. A Jefferson impersonator, the multiple-birth of 11 babies, a cynical high school teacher, a female dairy farmer, and an Episcopal priest all make for interesting characters; however, the circumstances they find themselves in are a stretch for the reader to believe. And the making of a mammoth cheese to present to the president of the U.S. just didn't do much for me -- in fact, the whole presidential election bit was a bit weak in my opinion. In short, it's entertaining and thought-provoking in places, but overall rather unbelievable."
3,"Uneven, but interesting","The author chose to write the book with a third person, removed narrator, who tended to give an overview of the very interesting, and usually funny, goings on in the town. This prevented the author from revealing the inner thoughts of the characters at times. This was particularly true of the mother of the eleven babies. The narrator gave us the information, for the most part, that the mother would allow to be known, if a real person. While this added to her character development in someways, I wanted more insight into her thoughts (and her husband, too.)One interesting aspect was the pastor's realization that his messages from God were tainted by the filter of his own self-interest. I came to like this character very much.A good read."
1,All the wit and vivaciousness of a huge cheese,"If you took out all the boring, tedious repetitions this would be a small book. After hearing each character's flaws, preferences, and ideas for the hundredth time, I began to be a little insulted. Yes, I can remember for all of three pages that August admires Jefferson. No need to tell me yet again. There were no surprises, no revelations, no analysis, and I really didn't care what happened to the characters."
1,"Nice try, but no","Miss Holman seems to have some good researchers working for her. And she can put together a nice sentence.The book turns out not to be funny or interesting though. Boring, boring, boring with characters that I couldn't find any concern for.I can't imagine why this book ended up with four stars????????????"
2,Stale,This book just felt stale and hard to read. Here are so many great books out there on canning tht this once just fails to rank. Maybe my grandmother would have enjoyed reading it but that is how old it felt to me.
1,Wrong trance CD ever,This is probably the worst trance CD I've ever heard.The only thing this CD has going for it is a strong continuous (if not mind numbingly boring) beat.
4,Awesome!!!,"Very good product slipped right onto the rifle perfectly, the only thing is sometimes it slips a bit but not enough to get in the way. Overall its very reliable."
5,Great product,"Great product. It fits my Mosin Nagant perfect, it is tight enought that I don't have to worry about it sliding around on the stock or having the bullet fall out. It won't cover the hole for the carry strap either. Cant beat the price!"
4,Just what I was expecting,"Fits perfectly well on my Mossber ATR 100. Only hicup is that it covers the sling hole, but nothing permanent.Can't wait to go out to the field this weekend!"
4,Convenient!,"It tends to slip forward over a shooting time, but is very convenient for holding some spare rounds. It was shipped quickly and worth the cost."
5,works great,"works like it is designed to, got it for my single shot 270 breakover holds the shell at ready for quick reload"
5,Great Cartridge Holder,I purchased this to pair it with my ATI stock I put on my Mosin. Looks great on there and does its job well.
4,looks sharp on Mosin Nagant with ATI Monte Carlo stock,Looks sharp on my 1939 Mosin Nagant rifle with ATI Monte Carlo stock. Lots of comments on the look from friends and fellow range rats. The holder did slip towards front of stock from the kick & pressure from my cheek.
2,Butstock ammo holder,This product may be O.K. but I can't use them because they are way too small for my rifles. I am sure that if I had a choice when ordering I would have asked for a large size. I emailed Allen Company with my complaint and recieved no answer. I guess I could have returned them but I should not have to pay shipping for their mistake. I may find a use for them someday. I did not contact Amazon as this is a small purchase. I do not blame Amazon as they did what they are supposed to do.Live and learn.
3,ok product,"it is a good product overall, but it could have a tighter fit to the but stock of the rifle"
3,Looks good,Looks good on my Mosin but tends to bunch up and move around when I am using the rifle. yep
5,Great for Winchester 94 30-30,I bought this for my Winchester 94 30-30 rifle and it fits perfect. Not much else to say. Great price and it does what is says. I would/will buy again in future.
4,Solid product,The elastic band makes this fit very snug and it fits 7.62 x 54R shells perfectly.The only downside is that it was built as though for a rectangular stock instead of a stock that slopes and isn't perfectly rectangular. This results in some loose material towards the trigger-side sometimes and can cause it to slide towards the trigger. This would not cause me to not purchase the item and I am merely noting it as an observation.
3,Get what you pay for,"Considering the price, it does its job well. I found it difficult to get on the stock. If I took the optics off my rifle it probably would have gone over the front easily, but I didn't feel like going that route. At the range there was some forward slippage. I already ordered a different cartridge holder that straps on, has a cheek rest, and a pocket for tools. For a few extra dollars, it seems worth it to me. The advantages are this is one super cheap and holds nine rounds."
5,Pretty good.,"Holds 9 rounds of 7.62x54R without issue. Fits well over the stock allowing you to still use the original sling on Mosin-Nagant 91/30. Seems pretty nice, though I doubt it'll last more than a year under rough use. But hey, at this price point that's still a fine investment. Makes the 91/30 a viable defence option for your home with a minimal budget now that you can keep 9 rounds on hand at all times.I'll buy more of these for my other rifles, definitely."
4,Holds 9 shots...,"It does what it says. It holds 9 rounds, in my case .308 or 7.62 x 51 fit just fine. So if I struggle to get that deer down with the first 5 rounds at least I've got 9 more right there to help me land at least one on target! lol"
4,Good Seller,"Fast shipping. I received what I ordered in a very timely manner. Cheaply made, but the price was cheap and you usually get what you pay for. I works well on a small caliber rifle though (30-30). The slots are tight enough for the smaller diameter shell casings to stay firmly in place."
5,I like it,I use this on my mosin nagant with boyds stock. slid this holder on and put my swivel stud though it and holds it great.
4,Fit nice.,"This shell holder worked real nice on my Mosin Nagant, which has a fairly undersized buttstock. It has an unsightly seam at the bottom and middle running the length of the seam, preventing a perfect fit. If not for the seam I would give it five stars. Still can't be beat for the price."
5,Tight Fit!,"this is a fairly well made product i use it on my Mosin Nagant fits snug, hols rounds tighly, the only thins is one day after using at the range there is quite a fell ""pulls"" in the material from rubbing on the wood table at the bench where i was shooting, technically that is my fault i should have layed a sheet down or somthing but for 7 beans, you cannot go wrong especially for a bolt acion mosin nagant"
5,useful,"works great for the price, i actually have these on most of the rifles i own these days. helps on recoil on mosin nagants since adds weight to offset recoil...cheap enough to buy one for all my rifles"
4,fits nicely,I just got this and put it on my Rem 700 BDL and it fit perfectly. Nice and snug. I will use it while hunting for the first time this next weekend. Hopefully it holds up but if it doesn't it is pretty inexpensive so no biggie.
3,Not for Mossberg 500,"The product itself was made of quality material and looked like it would do the job it is designed for. However,it did not fit properly on my Mossberg 500. Return was no hassle."
3,Does the job.,"Unfortunately, unlike many of Allen's other products, this one is not made in the USA. It's made in China. It is of good quality, though. The cartridge fits snugly on a variety of rifles and suits a variety of cartridges."
1,Wrong Item,"I ordered an ""Allen Company Buttstock Rifle Cartridge Holder"" from this seller, what I got was a shotgun shell holder.This review gets one star because it was the wrong item. The shell holder itself is of good quality for about $5, but I have no use for it."
5,Great for Mosin,"I got this for my Mosin Nagant and it works great. Not much else to say, but other sized rounds/rifle stocks will probably fit easily, such as 30-30."
4,Works for .410 shells,Bought this as a bit of a gamble. I wanted a nice buttcuff to hold .410 shells. Most shotgun buttcuffs hold them too loose. This does an admirable job. Nice snug fit on an H&R single shot. It hasn't seen the field yet but I see no reason to expect trouble. Great bang for the buck.
5,Bullet Holder,"This is just one of those items that you have to have on a rifle. Fits nicely on both of my guns, kids model 243 and adult 30-06."
4,Inexpensive and durable,This is a no-nonsense buttstock cartridge holder. The cartridges are held tight and it fits nice and tight on my Remingtion 700 AAC-SD stock. I have mine with the lable up on top because I like the cartridges on the right side and the lable is a good mark for my cheek to get eye relief on my scope. The only thing I wish was that it held 10 rounds instead of 9 since my gun can hold 5 rounds (4 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber). A minor gripe!You can't go wrong for the price.
4,Good Book.,"It's hard to write a review of a book like this.The Commons are such a big group of components, you really cannot cover all of it. Tim does a good job of introducing you to them (+2). Unlike most books, this is very readable, using (for the most part) clear examples (watch out for the phantom 'Person' class) (+1).The only draw-back I can really point to is that Commons is really designed to be straight forward and easy to understand, so an O'Reilly cookbook might be too indepth for this (-1). I like that I can read other posts by the author, related to Commons, in the ASF (+2)."
3,A pretty specific cookbook,"This book does provide a good overview of some of the most popular libraries in the Commons project. Although I have read and enjoyed several other Cookbook style books on more general topics, I did not find this one as useful. This is because the Jakarata Commons recipies are very speicific, and cover a wide array of unrelated topics. If you have a specific need that is covered, you will likely find the book helpful. Otherwise, it may be like some of the real cookbooks in my kitchen that are interesting, but rarely used."
4,Good introductory book to commons,"This book serves as a good introduction to commons project. It gave me a brief overview and applicability of the projects. Though the Cookbook doesn't serve as a exhaustive reference in itself, it starts the ground work ."
3,Okay Instrumental,"This CD is 36 minutes and 36 seconds long and was released on March 31, 1998. This is an okay CD. I myself just don't care for intrumentals. I never know the name of the song. The only song on this CD that is an original recording is Memphis performed by Lonnie Mack. The other 14 are stereo recordings. Like I said, it is an okay CD. For somebody else who is a fan of intrumental music, then this is for you."
2,Mullet vs.the military,"This is a hilarious action film/thriller supposedly set in the South (everybody drawls),but was filmed in---Vermont,land of maple syrup as well as Ben&Jerry;'s.There are plenty of explosions and shootings in the final minutes of the movie,especially when it's Billy Ray vs.the Baddies.Now Billy Ray has turned to lighter fare through ""Dancing with the Stars"" and starring opposite his real-life daughter on Disney's Hannah Montana show.Billy Ray Cyrus stars as a former CIA agent now ensconced in the South,and he's got a heart-as well as a mullet-for truth,justice,and the American way.He's ""Radical Jack."" He finds love with a woman whose abusive ex HAPPENS to be the same man behind his family's death.The plot is needlessly complicated with arms deals,the CIA,and Radical Jack's own questionable character--but it makes for dumb fun early morning viewing!"
4,Go on Hoolie,"A childrens book with wonderful pictures and a lot of questions to answer and to talk about the ideas.Sorry, but I think it's a little bit too expensive."
3,Antique & Collectible Fishing Rods - Identification and Value Guide,"While Homel's book is helpful in giving a general idea of a fishing rod's value, there are some gaps in information. For one, the material is four or five years old and collectible rods have skyrocketed in price in that time frame. So the dollar amounts placed on rods are not very realistic. Secondly, I have found that there are sizes and models of fly rods that are not included in the listings of the various rod makers or manufacturers. This can be a little frustrating when one has purchased, or is about to purchase a rod and cannot find any reference to it in the book."
2,antique and collectible fishing rods,"This book may be okay for someone who wants a short, incomplete reference guide on the subject of collectible fishing rods and their appoximate value. This is not a guide that gives you much information about which antique rods are worth buying if you are intent on fishing them. Some kind of information as to what weight fly line should be used on each rod and what the original rod 's intended use was (dry fly, wet fly, bass, trout, saltwater species, large or small stream etc). The list of rods reviewed is very incomplete, especially some of the more popular mass produced rods. For me, this book was a disappointment. It however, may be what you are looking for."
3,Helpful,I was rebuilding my Granddads Cane fly rod and it helped to identify the rod make and model. I wanted it to look like it did new.
4,Good Book,"Lots of good info in this book. Really well written too. However, I wish it was in color, and had more pages. Kind of short and in black and white. Worth the price if you are a serious collector, but not a fantastic value."
5,a great source,"This is an excellent read and also a must to have in your library. The author disusses in great depth various Roman structures. In many of the sites, he goes into detail about where the material would come from, whether it was trade or something made from the city's natural sources, and also discusses influences among the Greeks and the Romans."
5,Great memorable music and songs by David Foster & Jaye P,"I cannot stop giving this one play. It is great from beginning to end. No fillers. Jaye P Morgan is a great vocalist. There are some great versions of other artists songs here, but Jaye P does more than justice to them. Don't know how I missed this one and took me up to now to discover this great cd. So glad I did. I sampled every song on Youtube and became a believer of this cd...so I purchased it right here. I enjoy all genres of music (just look at my other reviews), everything from R&B to Metal, but damn!....this is some great jazz, r&b, & ballads music/songs. Gotta love it!....Jaye P. Morgan style."
5,For those desiring to Mature in Christ,This is a very much needed subject for the body of Christ. Maturity in the Fruit of the Spirit is a powerful force that comes out of our born again spirit to cause us to overcome. This book will help the maturing process and speed us along to victory in Jesus.
5,Every mother with a daughter will want this book,"This book is a must have for navigating the often stormy seas of female adolescence, and for celebrating and honoring the changes. The authors have an intimate voice, and tons of practical experience. I recommend it highly."
5,"Relaxation, visualization and auditory cues are used","Be The Ball presents the author's experiences as a weekend golfer who tries to improve his own game and bring the practice rang swing to the golf course. Relaxation, visualization and auditory cues are used in this audio to help guide listeners to pre-shot skills which will lead to improved scores. An intriguing application for meditation and learning."
3,"Great little radio, but...",The Freeplay S360 was at first a wonderful gift. It worked great and sounded really good for such a small speaker. BUT- when I crank it up now I get no power whatsoever- a little static and then nothing. Maybe the battery does wear out after all?
2,Spring broke a month after I got the Freeplay Radio,"Small radio fine for me...did the trick for working outside and listening to NPR until the spring broke. I can still use with solar power or an AC adaptor, but miss the winding option. Bought via ebay and mailed in warranty card, only for postal service to return card saying address no longer valid. :-("
4,Great Book!,I bought this book for my son to read for school. He is 13 years old. He loved the book. The best part of the book is when the characters went on a coon hunt. This book is a classic.
4,Best Book out of all 3!!,"The Road To Memphis I found was my favorite book out of ""Roll OfThunder, and Let The Circle Be Unbroken. The only bad part is the ending, because it leaves you wondering- what happens to Moe,will he and Cassie end up together? Moe was my fav. characterand I loved his personality. Its really hard to believe that only 60 yrs ago, blacks were treated this badly, and I found tearsin my eyes when Cassie and Her Father were talking about livingto see Blacks treated equally, and now {by most people,they are}.I absolutely loved this series, and im hoping that Mildred Taylorwill make another sequal!Also anyone who has heard about a sequal, or has seen the movieRoll of Thunder.... email me plz."
5,A very very good book,"I read all the books before it and I coudn't put any of those down but out of all har books I think this one is the best, It is a very powerful book and it really makes you think about how crule people were. I would recomend it to anyone. I'd yhave to say it is the best book I ever read"
5,The Real Deal,"The Road to Memphis is one of the best books i have ever read. This book is a heart tugger, and shows you through writing, how hard it was back then, and how a young women, and her family struggle to get to memphis unharmed, and undetected. If you want an adventure that teaches you how it was back then..this book is the real deal.My name is Ella, i am 13 almost 14, my mother bought this for me to read."
4,This Book is Great,"The Logan family is a black family who live in Mississippi during the time right before World War II. Cassie Logan, the main character is going to school when a friend gets into trouble and they have to take him to Memphis so he won't get arrested. Many things happen showing that the prejudice between black and white is far from being solved. Cassie ecspecially feels the sting of this prejudice as she realizes her dream of becoming a lawyer is not possible.I loved this book. It is exciting and full of adventure and it makes you realize how long it took for the African- American people to get their freedom and it makes you ask your self if they really are free today."
3,So- So,This book was a soso book. There were many times where I had to go back and reread pages. something I don't like to do. And to me his book was like a modle airplane. You need plenty if all most to much glue to hold the plane together. This book just had enough glue to hold it together. It still needed more. I would recomend this book to some one who is looking for a racism story. But in general I would not recomend it.
1,HOW I FELT ABOUT THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS,"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ IT IS ABOUTSEGREGATION AND HOW A BLACK BOY NAMED MOE LASHES OUT AT THREE WHITEMEN WITH A CROWBAR . BUT WITH THE HELP OF SOLOMON HUMPHRIES THEY ARE ABLE TO GET MOE ON A TRAIN TO CHICAGO TO GET WITH STACY'S UNCLE . CAN THEY MAKE IT OR DO THEY GET CAUGHT? IT KEEPS YOU ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET IF YOU ENJOY ACTION,MYSTERY,AND SUSPENSE."
5,?????????????,Is there a sequel? What happens to Moe? Do Moe and Cassie ever get married? What does Soloman do next? Does Moe ever come back?
4,My review,"I gave The Road to Memphis four stars because I find the book interesting and powerful. The author, Mildred D. Taylor, focuses her theme on racial discrimination and how it affected the black people during 1941. Also, I find the book powerful because it was really dramatic and compelling to the audience. The author explains things clearly, such as how the setting was connected to the character and how it develops a conflict."
5,The Best,This story I was hooked to the whole time I was reading it. It is one of the best books ever!! Very sad and painful.
2,Slow Read,"Not a bad read, but it was definitely outdated (always look at the copyright date!) Good summary, but definitely felt archaic. I guess finding a comprehensive book on spooks is tough."
3,Good overview,"This book is an excellent overview of the C.I.A. It presents an excellent picture of exactly how the C.I.A. works and how the various departments work. However due to its length (it is somehwat short for such a broad agency) it is not able to go into great depth concerning the great and not so great history of the C.I.A. If you are interested in a book which traces the C.I.A. from its very beginnings i would recommend ""The Secret History of the C.I.A. which gives much more detail about the history of the C.I.A."
3,Long news paper article,"It was like reading a very long newspaper article. 50% of the book was insightfll, the rest of it was just filler."
1,"Oh, the poor, misunderstood CIA","Apparently, the CIA has NEVER done anything wrong that we haven't already heard about in the popular press. At least, that's the impression to be gotten from this tedious, badly-edited work of apologist literary bureacracy. According to Kessler, the modern CIA is a thoroughly law-abiding, and highly misunderstood agency (with the possible exception of the directorate of security). And the few illegal activities the Agency has been involved in happened under past directors, particularly the much-vilified (and conveniently dead) William Casey. William Webster, in the author's eyes, is apparently ripe for canonization. Who knew the CIA was such a benevolent group of folks?"
2,"There are no secrets revealed. That's expected, though.","The CIA is a secretive organization. So it comes as no surprise that a book that states that it reveals the top secrets of the CIA is merely a hodgepodge of technical mumbo jumbo relating to how the agency works. It is not very informative, but what can you really expect? No one is really going to get to the bottom of what the CIA knows presently and what they are telling the president. It is better that way. Policymakers are able to surprise our enemies. At the same time, because the agency is secretive, we are able to benefit from novels and movies that probably exaggerate the day to day life of a CIA spy. If you're really interested in knowing secrets, I'd suggest reading a crime novel or joining the CIA itself. But this book does not help."
2,Not terribly revealing,"Kessler's Inside the CIA has more to say about the organization of the Agency than actual spycraft. As such it is hardly an interesting read - in fact, I would venture so far to say that it is downright dull. Kessler laboriously explains the table of organization of the CIA - what the 5 directorates are and what they do (in the abstract) with very little by way of specifics. The few interviews Kessler conducted in his preparation for this book were with former Directors - very little from the ""men in the field."" Most of the information Kessler presents can easily be found elsewhere, in a much abbreviated form, and at less cost than the book. If you are interested in a book about what the function of the CIA is and how it is organized to carry out its mission, this is the book for you. If you are interested in something about spycraft or are searching for stories about individual CIA operations, look elsewhere. In spite of its catchy title, you will be disappointed."
4,Kessler lifts the curtain of secrecy,"Ronald Kessler does an outstanding job informing and entertaining the reader. Moreover, ""Inside the CIA"" is both objective and comprehensive. Kessler uses his remarkable access to key actors in the CIA to lift the Agency's curtain of secrecy. He also dares to expose agency blemishes and is critical of organizational failures. I found his review of the Cold War outstanding and appreciated his detailed breakdown of how each Directorate functions within the Agency. However, the best part of this book is the many first hand accounts from former operatives."
2,Kessler should come back to this book for an update,"Good book, but very dated. Kessler is very informed about the workings of the CIA and the backgrounds of its employees and directors, but only up to when this book was published. It has a lot of interesting folklore about the beginning of the CIA and its different divisions. It's a good read if you want to get an overview of its structure and an idea of its mindset of the CIA up to and just after the fall of the Soviets. That being the post WWII era and the cold war. If he were to go back to this book's subject I am sure he would be able to gain a wealth of newer information more applicable to the current situations we face as a nation."
4,Excellent Overview of the CIA,"This book, together with the Puzzle Palace should be required reading in all high schools and colleges. We must guard our Privacy Rights and not allow government (or business) bureaucrats from invading them."
2,"Quick overview, lacks substance and gets repetetive","This book gives a good overview of the CIA structure, depicting each department individually. In doing so, the author jumps chronologically and repeats himself. This book had very few accounts of what CIA actually does, apart from a lot of references to the Inran-Contra affair (not exactly explained in the book). Apart from explaining how CIA is structured and giving a couple of semi-bios CIA directors this book leaves you wanting to read something else on the subject."
3,Good introductory book to the CIA's organization but not much else,"This book has a good introduction to the organizational structure of the CIA (when it was written) but little discussion as to operations, policies, successes, failures, background of personnel and the production of intellegence estimates. Very little analysis of these."
3,Good - but at times repetitive,"I found this book to be a good read. The only problem was that at times it seemed the author would use one of 5 or 6 examples throughout the book. This became rather frustrating and even confusing leaving the reader wondering if they were having DEJA-VU or reading the author forgot that he had already included the description of the event earlier in the book. Overall, I would suggest this book but I would caution that at times one may want to selectively read or skim some of the material due to it being either dry or repetitive in nature."
3,informative but a bit tedious,"This is a well-researched book on the CIA. However, a CIA officer told me that Kessler tends to take topics he is ignorant of and speculate about them yet writting as if it were objective fact. This was the case with his book Moscow Station. If you ever speak with anyone who spent time in the American Embassy (which I have), you'll likely hear the same thing. However, this book is interesting but it leaves you to wonder if what is written is really true. As I said I used to work in embassies so I know for a fact SOME of it is very true, but I can't speak for what I have not seen. All in all I recommend this book if your interested in the CIA but read other books by different authors so you can compare and contrast."
3,inside the cia,"I didn't realize the book was published approx. 17 years ago. The info was dated. I expected something more current. The book was paperback. For this??, I paid full price."
2,"Boring , dull reading",Just like read a long long laundry list. Or like read an operation manual written by someone just observed how people do the work but don't really understand.Recommend: Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA. That book is a much better overview of what's CIA's contribution in cold war years and recent days.
2,"Good for engineers, not-good for non-engineers","From a Safety Manager perspective, I found the descriptions of the incidents too brief. If you are looking for something with detailed incident information and corrective actions, presented in the form of a story, look somewhere else."
5,Very soft!,"I'm very happy with this sheet set. The price is great and the sheets are sooooo soft. I've gotten other all cotton sheet sets from Amazon and they were kind of crisp. These are very soft, the color is a nice soft pink and the dots are subtle but add a little something extra."
2,Poor quality,"Very poor quality, thin material, the dots are not that visible, it is true that ""you get what you paid for."""
4,"Hilarious, entertaining, with too many players","The Silver Bears is a hilarious story and entertaining story of intrigue about an attempt to corner the silver market, with a few too many players. Having read it twice (actually having heard a full-length audio version), I'm still a little vague about some of the intrigue."
4,NICE VARIETY NOT BAD FOR 99 CENT'S,BOUGHT THIS CD AT SECOND HAND STORE NICE SONG'S NOT ALL WINNER'S BUT NICE VAREITY LIKE THE SEMISONIC AND OZOMATLI ALONG WITH THE MURMUR'S AND THE CRYSTAL METHOD/GOT BEAT'S J.B.
4,An addition to the family library...,"Either this movie, or the original (black and white) version are excellent additions to the family bookshelves.If you are viewing this with kids, they may prefer this slightly (to them!) more modern version. The acting is quite good in this made-for-TV adaptation of a classic WWI movie that was banned by Hitler (a good indication that it should be watched!) because it was anti-war, and his need was to encourage, not discourage, young men to fight.From the viewpoint of young German soldiers who at first are eager to fight, until they face the realties of war, it is a classic WWI anti-war movie.Although there is war-related violence, it may be OK for some kids, but parents should view it first.Four stars because even though it is in color, it isn't quite as good as the original black and white."
4,Great Movie,"After reading the book and watching the original film of this piece, I watched this remake. Although it missed major parts from the book and the first film, it redeemed itself in the fact that the actors most adequately portrayed the character's emotions toward the war and their conflicts. Overall, it was a good movie and I aced this book's exam."
4,Getting There,"Having done a college thesis on this book and the two movie versions, I feel qualified to write reviews. Acting is far better here than in the version of 1930, and so are the special and sound effects. The reason is clear enough: in 1930, actors were new to the concept of sound in films. However, just looking at the DVD cover you know you will have to take this one with salt: he hasn't even got the right helmet on- that one is more WWII than WWI. Apart from things like that which only sticklers such as myself will actively object to, this is an excellent adaptation of a wonderful book. buy it, unless you hold a degree in German Militia in which case all this will do is annoy you. This means you, Mikhail."
3,Quality of DVD,"The movie was great. Very detailed. The story is developed well. It does take creative detours from the book, but that is to be expected. Very touching. However, the quality of the DVD was poor. There were scratches on the DVD and although it played pretty well the first time, it could not play through certain parts of the movie the next few times."
2,Not that great,"First of all, before reviewing this movie, please make sure you do not get the 1979 version of this film confused with the 1930 version. Paul did not die when reaching for a butterfly; he was drawing a bird. I, for one, do not see what everyone is raving about for this movie. I had to watch it in my history class and then write a paper on it. I found the acting very weak; especially in ""touching"" moments. When soldiers were falling on the battlefield, it looked like they tripped and fell. Perhaps for the time, the cinematography was satisfactory but there are much better war-time movies out today. I'm not saying this film has nothing to offer, though the book is much more powerful and beneficial in documenting a German soldier's expereince in WWI."
3,re-make of 1930 original was OK but not as good,Original 1930 version was truer to the novel in terms of impact and intent by the author. The movie was good but appeared tailored to the 1970's viewing audience.
4,Great!,"I saw this movie in school, and it made the ever-so-boring global class interesting for a few days. I think it woke some of my classmates up (and me!) about the physical as well as emotional hardships of war. The story is layed out very well, including many facts (that I'll need on a future test!!) and an interesting storyline. I have never had any type of interest in war, but this movie certainly was a wake up call. It was very realistic, and makes people realize that things like war shouldn't be happening."
4,Not the Original TV version,"The video ""All Quiet on the Western Front""is not the original one shown on TV in 1979. It was editted by about 30 minutes. If you ever see the it you will see the difference. The uncut version is much clearer. Examples of editing include the scene with the Kaiser when Himmistoss recieved the metal it is explained why he got the metal in the uncut version.there are other examples mostly dealing with anti war themes sounds funny for an antiwar movie but..............."
5,all Quiet,good movie. story line is good enjoyed it immensely John boy (Richard Thomas) was good and well rounded character showed well what folks in those day went through after going home from war and Ernest Borgnine was just as good in his role
2,Another incomplete dvd of a an excellent tv drama,"This is another incomplete dvd of a an excellent tv drama. I getting tired of buying what I think is going to be a complete film only to discover that for some bonehead reason it's been cut to shreds. The same thing happened to me when I bought a 4 dvd set of Shogun! Why the hell can't dvd's be labeled ""complete"" or ""abridged""? Also, why edit in the first place? People who buy dvds buy them because they want more than what they are shown on tv or in the movie theater."
2,don't be fooled,"I have the original from TV that I taped many, many years ago and have used in my classroom for over 20 years. When I ordered the VHS tape a few years back I was shocked by the number of scenes that were deleted in order to condense the movie to one videotape. These scenes were critical to the development of the plot and make a huge difference in following Paul's descent. I was very disappointed because I thought the original was an excellent movie for the classroom."
5,Love It!,This faucet set looks fabulous with my old fashioned tub and I get so much more use from the hand shower feature. The gold tone brass has held up well. I had my contractor install it as well as purchase and install a matching drain assembly.
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL HITS!!! * Beware! *,"A couple of the songs on this compilation ARE by the orginal artists (The Turtles for one), but even though the bands who made the songs HITS are listed here and even on the CD itself, MOST of these songs are new, recent covers!!! And, no offence to the studio musicians, but not very good covers!!! This whole series from k-tel (Ultimate History of R & R) must be the same, since the subtitle of THIS one ('Those Were the Days') isn't even the actual hit (and, it's AWFUL). Well, whatya expect from K-tel and for four bucks - but I wish Amazon had known and warned us."
5,The Sirens of Ming Hai,"This fast paced and complicated spy thriller kept me imprisonsed within its pages. The plot begins when a young Chinese student, Jiang Ou or Jennifer, is completing her studies in the US. To avoid being returned to China and to a pre-arrainged marriage, she is coerced into spying for her country. Despite strong family ties to the Communist regime in Bejing, her loyalties are to her secret love, currently imprisoned in a Harbin ""lao gai"", as a disident. In order to obtain his freedom, she becomes a double agent for Taiwan. As Jennifer moves to her assignment in Washington D.C., she soon charms her way to the highest levels of the U.S. government, always one step ahead of the Secret Service. As the story unfolds, Jennifer becomes involved in the complicated mix of international politics, military/industrial corruption and personal moral conflicts. Her decisions will alter the world events and to many, will be considered a heroin as the Sirens of Ming Hai will testify."
3,good workout bad dvd,I liked the flow of the routine of the dvd. Jennifer is a good instructor with clear direction. The woman is flexible like a rubberband!! She is very inspiring. The only problem with the production was the breaks in between the segments was way too long and you can't fast forward through it. Also I must have gotten a bad dvd because it keeps freezing for 10 seconds or longer at a time. It didn't do that at first but I used it for the third time the other night and I have a feeling the problem will get worse as it keeps getting used.
4,Excellent teaching for beginner,"I've been using Baron Baptiste's videos for years and like them, but I wanted something new. Jennifer Lynn's routines have opened my eyes to improving my postures and getting more out of the workout. I nearly abandoned the DVD early on because it begins with a lecture about how to have a good life, healing, etc., which I found a huge turn-off. I wasn't interested in Ms. Lynn's views on such matters, only as they pertain to yoga. I can connect my own dots.When it comes to explaining yoga and energy within that moment, she is clear, insightful, and purposeful. I felt like I'd been to the chiropractor after the beginner session, as if all my bones were in the right place. The intermediate routine was challenging and fun."
3,Satisfactory yoga flow video,"Overall I suppose I must agree with the other reviewers, this is a nicely put together yoga program. I was a little dissapointed with a couple of things. First, I felt that the video picture quality was not at a really professional level. The colors are washed out in several places and the image appears slightly distorted in same cases. The voiceover seems to reach for the kind of metaphors that Richard Freeman provides so well but here had a slighly fortune cookie feel to them (""Think of your legs as drinking straws...""). Overall a good choice though."
4,Sharon Rocks but LP was unplayable.,"Sharon Jones just rocks, that's all I can say. Great album but Dap Tone Records NEEDS to find somewhere else to get their LPs pressed. I have every Sharon Jones album on vinyl and every one has been warped, pressed off center or has some other major defect. This particular album was so warped the cartridge on my turntable was actually hitting it on playback and the album was unplayable. The seller refunded my money so no complaints there but I need to buy another copy. I can only imagine what this would sound like pressed at QRP and mastered by Analogue Productions on some nice 180/200g vinyl."
1,Re: Laugh out loud,"God this album was horrible. If you know what the real thing is supposed to sound like, that is the sound/vibe they are going for, you will pee yourself laughing at how bad this is. Sharon's voice is the highlight. The problem is the songwriting is terrible, too many poorly composed one note sounding melodies, lousy production with the bass drum too stark, undefined bass, and a drummer whose soul feel just isn't there. Listen deep to this Cd after having immersed yourself in classic early 70s soul and you'll be laughing too. The last tune on any album is supposed to be great. I found myself trying to stay awake while listening to it. The worst part is I was driving. Quite frankly its an ersatz version of the real thing. I never saw what the big deal with this group was and it was confirmed by this CD. Mediocrity for those that don't know their soul roots."
5,Can't take it out of the CD player!!,"Heard this CD playing at the a local indie store and bought it on the spot. If you are like me and new to purchasing this type of music, this CD is a good place to explore what FUNK really is! It;s not the junk you hear at dance clubs today for sure. I have always been a rock and roll guy but this album just grabbed me. Give it a shot and I am sure you will LOVE it!"
1,An aluminum handle ?,"While this peeler has great reviews, I am not sharing the experience.First of all, it does not cut all that well and I had some ""EL Cheapos"" in the past that were doing a much better job.But, an aluminum handle ? If you wash it in the dishwasher, you'll have black fingers, that's for sure.My last ""El Cheapo"" purchase at Wal*Mart was a disaster and went directly into the trash can.I was hoping for a better quality and was very disappointed.I'll keep lookin'"
1,Poor quality; unpractical,"We ordered this peeler, thinking it would be a nice design; but turned out to be bad quality and does not even look that good."
3,Very Good For Small Jobs,"This peeler is extremely sharp, however, the handle is small and uncomfortable. So for small jobs it's great, but if I had a lot of peeling to do, I would go for something like and Oxo with a large, comfortable handle."
5,Good and sharp,"This peeler is excellent ergonomically and plenty sharp. It is also made in the USA, which attracted me to buy it."
2,Had potential,"I've been looking for a high-quality, useful peeler. Unfortunately, this doesn't fit the bill. The handle is too small to be securely gripped - especially with wet hands as is often the case when peeling.The blade supports are too close to the blade and I find that peelings get caught in between the blade and the supports requiring me to stop and clean it out before continuing (this happens every 4th or 5th stroke - very annoying).I love to support US manufacturing - but the product has to be good at what it is supposed to do. This is unfortunately getting chucked and I'm still looking."
2,Average at best,I have got negative review from my wife for buying this peeler!After trying it myself I understand why - it peels too much skin and handling is not that great. We are using different peeler now.
4,Buy this. Now.,"This peeler is fantastic. I had no idea how fantastic peelers could be until I used it. The first time I set out to peel a cucumber, the peel hit the wall of my kitchen. It requires so much less effort and pressure than my old peeler. You can peel anything and it doesn't jam up. The peelings just leap off the blade. I love it."
4,It Does the Trick,"This flange for a table saw works great. Pulls most of the dust from the table saw down and into the DC system. The flange, mounted upside down, on the table saw allows for a dust connection from the bottom of the table saw. It's underneath, so it is out of the way of any sawing going on, and will collect almost all the dust generated.The only negative was, there are no mounting holes, had to drill them myself, but it was no problem. I guess this allows it to be used for many different table saws......."
4,Works good for my Delta table saw,"Made a plywood adapter, and use this flange to attach the dust collector to my Delta table saw. I have the flange connected to a short piece of flex tubing, and then to a blast gate that is mounted on the saw frame. This way I don't have to crawl under the saw to connect - works great."
5,Recipes for exotic and traditional tortilla dishes,"Gourmet Tortillas provides recipes for exotic and traditional tortilla dishes, opening with a set of unusual tortillas recipes for making different tortillas at home - from oatmeal to cream cheese - and then pairing these tortillas with fillings. The result is a fine gathering of dishes which require some preparation but produce unusual end results. No photos."
2,Meh...,"Boring. Wasn't what I expected. Just a few articles on Kazdin's research. If you hace access to a data base, do not buy. Just look them up."
1,Do not buy,When I finally needed to use this coffee mug it leaked all over me and my car.For the price .it should be of better qualityDo not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Great Vocals,The album does what it is ment to do. which is to showcase michale's vocals. Kiske has gotten smoother and more controled as the years have passed. some of the lyrics leave us asking what he was talking about but the vocal quality is incredible!. Also the first track shows Michael to be much deeper than anything hes done before. A great albumn all in all though not for everyone. It takes a truley progressive ear to go from helloween to Instant Clarity to this. I like it.
5,Micheal Kiske's beautiful voice soothingly reminds you to appreciate and cherish life.,"I had never heard of Michael Kiske until I watched ""4 Octave Wonders"" clips on YuTube. The moment his clip started, I thought, ""Wow, that's a beautiful voice!"" So I tried the previews of this album, liked them, and bought the album. I am a die hard Rob Halford and Judas Priest fan, so if a lesser voice is singing, I will never touch music like this. However, I find this album a nice counterbalance to the heavily dramatic music of Rob Halford and Judas Priest. Yes, it is possible to live your life to the full quietly but delightfully, by appreciating and cherishing the life you have.Wonderful album that warms your heart."
1,What the hell happened to KIske?,"After he was fired from helloween i had high hopes then I heard Instant clarity...which was passible but still crap compared to his Helloween material. Then supared came along which was not that great, now this....my how the mighty have fallen. At least Helloween is still on top, if he wanted to take Helloween in this direction then im glad he got fired."
2,I want back those 78 minutes of my life.,"The first five minutes of the movie were actually pretty cool. An exciting car chase and shoot-out. After that, I found the movie to be predictable and tired. The dialogue sounds like it was written for junior high students. There was a hideous and graphic five minute scene where a steer is first shot, and then butchered with an axe and various cleavers. This film can best be described as an amateurish hispanicsploitation film, where all Americans (except Telly Savalas) are shown as brutal racists and profiteers. Leave this one in the bargain bin of history."
2,"Good filter, stupid price","Just because this has the Jet branding on it, one is expected to pay well over twice what the same or better filter at one of the big box stores. Make sense to you? Not to me."
4,very good and still relevant book,"The book deals with Higgs' return to Erewhon. Some unpleasant surprises are in store for him, place is entirely unrecognizable due to new religion - sunchildism. Higgs, the Sunchild, finds it hard to beleive how his sayings got so corrupted and is unable to do anything about it. Declaration that he is the Sunchild only brings his life in danger, since professors of Music Banks are not going to let go new lucrative businees just like that. Fascinating book, dealing with rise of new religion out of one ""miracle"" (i.e. unexplainable event such as Higgs escape in a baloon) account of which grew out of proportion every year."
2,"Of Two Minds, Again","The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world.The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental. I know that the chamber of horrors at the ""mental hospital"" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear. And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know."
1,choppy and limited one-dimensional plot,"The beginning chapter read very much as ""I like green. Green is my favorite. Houses are pretty."" It was tough, the sentences were oddly simple and didn't have much substance to them. You were into the plot and moving before you were really interested in following the characters along."
4,Great story love Casper and Brendan,Amazing book I kind of wish that this had just the story of first 5 characters Casper and Brendan are amazing I love their story I just want to know about them but guess I'll have to read it all to understand!
3,Good story. Bad writing.,"I didn't hate this book, but the bad writing distracted from the story. I liked the story. It may be full of clichés, but it was entertaining. Most of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, and the author kept repeating himself when describing the characters or situations. It just came off as cheesy. Some of the situations the characters found themselves in seemed rushed and unrealistic. This isn't the first book I've read from this author. So I know he is a better writer. I'm assuming this is one of his first novels."
2,Too Idealistic,"This book is good, but it is too unrealistic, and main character, the football jock Brandan cried too much.It started off very good and interesting, because you gotta see clint & brandan different point of view and how people think differently without knowing what others think. Then afterward the plot is getting too unrealistic and like chances for that happen is zero, after like clint & brandan meet nathan & ethan, they are almost like identical twins and very similar (or same) backgroud and like everyone around them is all accepting and so. It is not a bad book, but actually i expect more from it."
3,High school love,"I thought this book was a bit on the ""tame"" side. I was looking to read about real life experiences when teens are coming to grips with their sexuality - and this includes their sexual experiences as well. The book never really touched on the boys sexual experiences! I'm not looking to read erotic novels, but do enjoy real life stories with real life sex as well. This book might be more appreciated by a younger audience who can relate more to the characters in the book. I just felt the story was not quite real enough!"
1,Drivel...,"I guess the author never heard of a developmental editor because some of the passages in this book are so weak and simple, I was suprised a grown man wrote them (I mean, pages and pages of simple dialogue and sentence structure). But then, this is one of those instant books, self-published, and so there is often very little quality assurance. The cover (blurry) should have warned me. I'm not sure why this book earned all the positive reviews, unless maybe the author enlisted friends and family. To me, it's no better than monkey-scratch."
2,"Good Story, Mediocre Writing","This book is definitely a teen book. The writing is simple at best. The story seems choppy, mostly because of the grammatical and spelling errors. The characters are likeable, but somewhat unbelievable. Casper is on one extreme end. He is utterly and desperately poor, beaten, molested, and has only one shirt and pair of jeans? He only has moldy mayonnaise to eat? It is hard to believe that he spends all evening wondering around after school, you would think he would get a job. I know that opposites attract, and the fact the Brendan falls for Casper is believable, I just think that the author has tried too hard to make them opposite. This bothered me for the entire story.The author seems to have the need to constantly repeat himself in simple terms to prove a point. I would have liked this book better if the writing had been more complex. It is a great story, but I think that anyone over fifteen would find the writing a little uninteresting."
3,A Better Place...took a while to get there.,"So, all in all, this was a pretty good book, but i would say that the author definitely should have trimmed it up a bit. I started off very good, was suspenseful, but after the first half, it just seemed to drag on. I saw about 4 places where he could have ended the book, and near the end, it was extremely anticlimactic, many questions went unanswered, and the ending which should have been a very emotional and climactic moment fell far short of par. I also feel he put some scenes in just to make the book longer. It was a good book though, but it left a lot to be desired. 3 Stars."
2,Accurate but not inspiring,"I have mixed feelings about this very basic book. There are some good points in here, and the illustrations show what they are intended to. The beginning artist shouldn't have too much difficulty applying any of the methods demonstrated here. However, there is a downside to simplicity, that being that the illustrations are elementary to the point of being uninspiring. They fail to even hint at what would be possible to attain with any degree of experience. There are better choices available for anyone who plans to continue with much painting. For the beginning and intermediate artist, after 30 years it's still hard to beat the demonstrations contained in Wendon Blake's comprehensive Complete Painting CourseThe Complete Painting Course, which combines many of his separately published titles into one comprehensive guide."

5,a book read to death,This was one of my all time favorites when I was a kid. I read it so many times that the book became tattered. I still have it. The writer does a great job of making the search for a fish into high drama. When I was a child this book opened my eyes to the sciences that were out there to study. It also showed that two people could change what is known about evolution.
3,Photo Art & Craft,"The book has lots of great ideas, unfortunately, most of them require the photo to be photocopied. I wanted ideas that would have allowed me to use my inkjet printer. It would be nice if the book description had mentioned this fact."
5,Very readable and informative!,"This book has it all! It shows the fascinating and touching interactions of preschoolers and teachers, the dilemmas and joys parents face as they watch their children grow, and the nitty-gritty details of what a child-care center needs to do to survive financially and provide high quality care. The characterization is strong, and I found that I really came to care about the particular children and teachers in the book. As a parent, I was entertained by some of the children's very familiar antics. When I was finished with the book, I passed it along to the director of my son's preschool, and she found it so interesting and informative that she's been having her staff read it. Enjoy!"
3,Logo quality lacking,"While the hoodie itself seems to be of good quality, the Zelda logo which appears to have been silk screened or otherwise transferred was extremely light and more white than the gold tone shown in the image. Having done silk screening in the past, it appears that what I got was the tail end of a run. It was a gift which was acceptable, but definitely not the quality of image I had expected."
5,Zelda zipper triforce hoodie,"Sweater is very comfortable. I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan so this was a must have for me. I ordered this in a large size. It was a bit bigger than I thought it would be but since Medium was not available I have no issues. Still smaller than an extra large. But who knows, it might shrink when I washed it right? The logo itself is quite colorful, it actually looks a bit more brownish as opposed to the one in the picture. Overall I'm highly satisfied with this sweater."
3,Really nice sweater,"First let's get one thing clear. I ordered the Zelda Beanie and this. They were sent in the same package to here in Sweden, which was idiotic. Because of this I had to pay customs for more than half the price of the items together. Seriously, WHAT WERE THE SUPPLIERS THINKING? I'm going to try to contact the suppliers and tell them to never package items together when they are sent to Europe. We have to pay so hefty taxes it's crazy.Oh well, review of the sweater itself.. It's really nice, large fits like a glove on me who's normally built and 1,80meter tall. I could've taken one size larger but I'm not sure, we'll see what happens after a couple of washes :)Uhm the print is somewhat scrapy, it would've been nicer if it was whole and proper. But it's still VERY snice. At the back there's a small The Legend of Zelda logo. Not much else can be said about this. Very nice item. Definatly recommended."
5,The Marching Wind,"Although The Marching Wind was written in the late 40's, this non-fiction story is still very intriguing in today's world. It relates the story of traveler/explorer Leonard Clark and his yak caravan journey through Tibet. Clark convinced the Chinese Nationalist leaders that he could find them an escape route through Tibet as the communists approached. At the same time, Clark plans to measure a mountain in Tibet that is reputably higher than Everest.The book is written as a detailed travel log of the expedition through the wilds of forbidding Tibet during incredibly cold weather for which none of the modern equipment used for extreme weather is available. The caravan is constantly on watch for the fierce Ngolog tribe members reputed to be highly aggressive and murderous. It is a well written and exciting story."
2,not comfortable for workout,"This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out. Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe. I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this. For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example)."
1,This set has really gone downhill...,"I originally bought this set perhaps five or six years ago and they worked fairly well and I didn't find anything amiss with them although I knew they weren't a high-end set. They worked well and were sharp. I'm a contractor and they've been used mostly for ripping softwoods and cutting cedar shingles. I recently purchased this set again and was disappointed to find these, as others have reported, pretty much dull right out of the box. I initially installed the 60-tooth in my chop saw and I found I had to push down very hard on the chop saw to drive it through KD pine and it was a splintered cut, not clean at all. Sorry, Dewalt, these have become real stinkers. They didn't end up being much of a ""deal"" for me at all."
5,tools,My father in law loves this package of saw blades. He loves the dewalt brand and glad that they came in this size package. This is exactly what he was looking for.
5,"Great value, Great product",Couldn't go wrong with a good price on a valued name brand saw blade and these lived up to the expectation.
5,Two Saw Blades from Dewalt.,"I received this item on time and it was packaged perfect. The blades were in mint condition,they cut like a champ, and I used one for my Miter saw and the other for my table saw.I'm a happy camper now. The price was outstanding as well. It listed a $5.22 deduction so therefore i didn't feelthe shipping price was bad at all. Again thanks Amazon.Mr. B."
4,Looks good,"I bought these table saw blades for my son, for Christmas. Because they were a gift, I can't comment on the quality and performance. But I have purhased Dewalt blades before, and would purchase them again. The product actually arrived faster than promised, and that was during the Christmas rush."
4,"Great Value but ""pricey""","I just received this saw blade package in the mail today. But over this past weekend I found the same blades at Lowe's for $10.00 cheaper. Between 32-34 dollars and no need to wait to have it shipped. All the reviews I've read say that there great blades I will see this weekend as I have many projects to get a start on while the weather is getting better. ""Mac"" from Southgate, Mi."
2,Arrived dull?,"Perhaps mine arrived dull, but the 60 tooth split through pine 1 x 6's and left a big mess on the underside of everything I've cut with it. Very disappointed, especially given the original blade my DeWalt saw came with was so nice.I bought these to do some fine work, they are definitely not capable of doing that."
1,"Dewalt 10"" blades","I have been a Pro. carpenter for over 25 years, bought this combo pack because of the ""deal"". They are probably the crappiest blades I have ever used, not sharp and splinter the back of the cuts. Both blades were also warped and upon start up made the saw jump. Dewalt has really gone down hill, all of their products are made in China and their hand tools aren't much better than cheap box store home owner tools. Shame on you DEWALT !! Spend a bit more and get a Pro. quality product. Makita makes excellent finish blades as does Freud."
3,Scaled-down Bach,"I don't care how authentic it is supposed to be, for me it just doesn't work, for the same reason that Joshua Rifkin's cantatas and Cantus Colln's B Minor Mass never worked. They're just too lacking in substance. There is much fine playing and singing to be heard here (although the solo singers sometimes aren't great), but the lack of a proper chorus, with only the soloists singing the chorales, isn't for me, I'm afraid. The aficianodos tell me that I should be rejoicing in the clarity of lines that such arrangement brings, but give me Gardiner and the Monteverdis or Suzuki and the Bach Collegium Japan and a bit of oomph! any day. Of course, if minimalist Bach is your cup of tea, just add two stars."
1,Worthless People,"I have not received the item yet. I have received only emails, totaling greater than 6000 words. I will never order from you again."
3,Order extra!,Ammo is easily lost since it's so small. Order extra and save a little on shipping. We haven't been able to find the ammo at any local stores.
3,zxcvczx,came in the mail fast so that was pretty cool. other than that i would recommend to others its worth it
2,Poor video quality and sequencing,"Being a Nazareth fan, living in the Houston TX area, and being familiar with the concert hall where this was filmed (though it's been since torn down), I was highly interested in finding this. It was disappointing though went I put it on the DVD player. The video quality is poor. The sound isn't that great either. Some of the behind-the-scenes shots are interesting, seeing them driving around downtown Houston, talking on their bus. And there's footage of them hanging out and walking around either Galveston or New Orleans.The songs are not sequenced (edited) properly on the disc, so that it's hard to go directly to a particular song. You have to fast-forward. Also annoying is some of the poor videos showing over the live music. Would have been better to left the concert video footage for that.Only recommended for Nazareth freaks."
3,"Fun to listen to, but songs are not the best","This CD was fun to listen to since I love the movie so much. But, the songs were really not that great."
4,Really Cool 80s tunes,I don't buy movie soundtracks. This is probably one of two I have. Most of the tracks on this disc have a lot of positive energy. I came of age during the 80s so that is the sound that puts a smile on my face and gets me going. The Bone Symphony tracks are why I bought this but others I've also become fond of. I paid about $15 for it and it was worth it. It's a one time payment. Not a recurring fee.
4,The Sweet Sounds of Nerds,"This soundtrack is AWESOME! The only thing it's missing is the Nerds Rap, from when they win the talent show. There is a song on there that has the rad electric violin,etc., parts in it. . .but it's not the same without Lamars singing. All in all this is REALLY worth it, because there are some GREAT songs on here that you probably wouldn't be able to find most places. Definitely not iTunes! I looked! :) Get this and dance til you drop."
3,Go Ahead- watch it!!,"Gurinder Chaddha goes right over the top- you can hear her exhorting her cast and crew for more! more exhuberance, more colours, more everything! Why have 15 extras dancing when you can squeeze 50 in the frame!But thankfully the quantity over quality bulldozer approach does not obscure the engaging story (GO,AUSTEN!) and the insightful directorial eye Chaddha possesses despite herself.The subtle and not so subtle inferior value society has placed on these girls, all of whom are mostly obliged to dangle for an eligible match, their unhappy acceptance of their lot, the overt games the mothers play to put their chicks in the path of ""well settled"" grooms, is all vintage Austen and current India!A. Rai is feisty, and beautiful, and her ""sisters"" can all act. Without any of Mira Nairs lyricism but with it's own coarse charm and humor, this movie was ultimately fun to watch."
3,"Cute, but no diversion from Bollywood films","Having loved 'Bend It Like Beckham', I was enthralled to know that Bride & Prejudice was coming out in Hollywood. Having expected a great crossover film, all I saw was the typical Bollywood musical. If you're expecting something all folks can relate to, this isn't for you. While it does follow Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"" storyline with an Indian, modern twist on it, I have to confess that my heart is still with the Colin Firth version of P&P. Honest opinion: save your money unless you're head over heels in love with Aishwarya Rai."
3,It's just okay--not as good as you'd think it would be,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. I liked only the first part of it, which is the part that has Naveen Andrews in it. He was, hands-down, the best part of this movie. My favorite part was at the beginning when they were at the wedding. The dancing was superb, especially Naveen's, which was quite unexpected. As soon as Naveen disappeared, the movie went downhill in my opinion.There was only one other dance number I enjoyed, which was the one where the other girls were teasing Aishwarya (Ash) about Mr. Kohli. That number was funny, and the rest of the movie was very boring. I didn't like the rest of the song and dance numbers. The acting was just so-so.If you want to see a really good Bollywood movie, I highly recommend Kuch Naa Kaho, which was the first Bollywood movie I'd ever seen. Kuch Naa Kaho is the standard I use to measure other Bollywood movies, and so far, none has matched that standard."
3,Bride and Prejudice,I thought the movie was not as good as it was rated. I prefer the original version on pride and prejudice. This bride and prejudice is a poor reflection of the movie pride and prejudice. On the other hand for pure entertainment its alright to watch.
1,Just couldn't,"I soooo wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. The breaking out in song and dance was just too much. I love musicals normally, but this one was just so cheesy. And the main female character was too ""modern woman"". Her character was trying too hard to come across as independent, it caused me to not like her. I'm sorry I bought this movie."
2,Bad Casting and Characterization,"Sorry, but Elizabeth's character in Pride and Prejudice was meant to be plain and her sister was the beautiful one. That was a recurring point in the story. Then why the heck did they cast Ashwarya Rai ""most beautiful woman in the world"" as the plain sister. Give me a break!Wickham. Give me another break! In the original, he is a charming poor guy who sweeps vulnerable and strong women alike off their feet into doomdom. In this version, I could not see, for the life of me, why anybody would want to spend a minute alone with this fellow let alone the rest of their life. His charm, if anything, was unconvincing.The storyline was cute, but the actors did not have enough screen presence to carry this time old tale."
3,Masala flavoured bubblegum...,"Bride and Prejudice is a Bollywood crossover musical that's more or less a pretty straightforward adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. The film has the emotional gravity of a feather, but it's aided by some lively cinematography by Santosh Sivan, colorful choreography, a pretty good score by Anu Malik and a comely cast that should set many a heart throbbing.Gurinder Chadda is well aware of the limitations of the material and genre and does well to keep the film moving at a fairly brisk pace.This is the kind of film that's best enjoyed in the big screen and the chances are that you will have a good time when you are watching it. Just remember that this isn't something to ruminate about after you leave the theater -- it might be masala flavoured, but it's bubble gum after all..."
5,No Life Without Fun,"A lot of people love Bend It Like Beckham. Personally, I thought that movie was extremely boring and gave it away as soon as possible. So, I must admit, I was a little skeptical when my best friend made me watch this movie (especially since Pride and Prejudice is my all-time favorite book).Within minutes, I was in love. The random song and dance numbers, Kholi, the irony, everything was perfect. It was a wonderful twist on Austen's beloved book.I fell in love with Darcy and Lalita. ""Take me to Love"" has become one of my favorite songs. The Cobra Dance has me falling off my chair from laughter everytime.This movie couldn't have been better. I've watched it well over twenty times and each time it just gets better!"
4,Cute and Entertaining,"This entertaining story of a middle-class Indian family trying desparately to marry off its daughters to wealthy eligible bachelors is masterfully pulled off with wit and charm by director Gurinder Chadha.Jane Austen's story is very well played out in the the modern Indian family setting in which arranged marriages and true love are still somewhat prevalent themes today. The stereotypes of modern India are charmingly brought out in the banter between Rai and Henderson who exhibit the Darcy-Lizzie chracters in the film. You can't help but laugh and go along with the antics. Of course, in true Bollywood style, there is a lot of song and dance. But there is also western musical number with the Grease-inspired ""No Life without Wife"".Colorful costumes, spectacular locations, beautiful actresses and charming characters make this film an enjoyable keeper."
4,East Meets West!,"This movie was very much impressive and acutally quite surprised me. The movie stars the gorgeous Aishwarya Rai(Lalita) and the wonderful Martin Henderson (Darcy). In this typical Indian, Bollywood, East meets West movie Darcy and Lalita start off hating each other and find it hard to adapt to each others customs. But as the movie progresses..opposites attract! The movie is bittersweet and flourishes with its colour and songs. The movie also stars the highly funny mother who is desperate to marry her kids off. Bollywood movies dont get much better than this.....with corny one liners and laugh out loud jokes and ethnicity this movie shines! The songs are lovely (No Life Without Wife) and Mr.Kholi is as funny as funny can get. This is a must watch!Watch for the sisters Kobra Dance - I was in stitches!"
3,Never Can Be...,"Another musical quite as good as Sound of Music (1965). This surely does not try to compete with Sound of Music, but that is all that I had to compare this one with. The story was good, and some of the music was even better, but to be honest this is just not my taste for entertainment. Nice try!!"
2,Shallow,"Having been a fan of Austen and well-made Bollywood movies too, I still could not take this one for whatever it was worth. I guess I expected more from Chaddha (Director) who has done exceptional work in making ""Bend it like..."". This doesn't even come close because its neither true Bollywood nor Hollywood, but simply a loose coupling of both. No attention has been given to details, especially in the sets staged in Goa and scenes of Punjab state. Acting is shallow, especially by Rai (Lead Actress). Chaddha needs to learn more from the likes of Mira Nair and Rai should give up acting complex roles now."
4,East Meets West.....,"One part musical, one part Bollywood, and one part romantic chick flick and you have a great movie! Great wholesome fun...... This movie is inspired from Jane Austen's novel ""Pride & Prejudice"" with an Indian flair to it.Lovely film! I enjoyed the music, singing and dancing seen through out this movie as well as the acting. Highly recommend this movie!"
4,Bollywood,"I like musicals, this one is funny also. I watch it as much as I can. I would buy more soon as I can save up the money."
3,"Fun and Funny, A good interpretation what a Bollywood movie","Fun and Funny, A good interpretation what a Bollywood movie would be in English. Jody Bissoon"
5,great movie and great service,This movie is pretty fun . It takes each situation and makes a song to go with it. Everyone in the house wanted it after rienting it.
3,Bride and Predjuduce,It was slow but at least it had a story line that could be followed. The diction wasn't as good as I was expecting.
4,Great adaption,"This is a creative adaption of Pride and Prejudice...definitely not as good, but still very entertaining. This is definitely Bollywood!"
5,3 Cheers for The Cobra Dance!!,"Based on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice with an Indian flair!! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - I call it a ""Musical Romantic Comedy."" Mr. Collins becomes Mr. Kholi-sab and what a character this Indian Mr. Collins is!! My favorite part tho was The Cobra Dance done by the ""ugly"" sister - the looks on everyone's faces was Priceless with a P!! If you've had a bad day, watch this movie - I guarantee you'll be feeling alot better by the end. :)"
4,"""Life Is Great, Let's Celebrate!"" ~ Bollywood Without Subtitles","If you've ever been tempted to rent or purchase an Indian film but declined because of your iniate fear of reading subtitles fear no more. Released in '05 'Bride and Prejudice' is a wonderful revisioning of the classic English love story 'Pride and Prejudice' done in English but in indelliable Bollywood style. Aishwarya Rai is perfect as the intelligent and irrepressiable Lalita and Martin Henderson is likeable and amiable as her rich American suitor who must overcome his American prejudices and the influence of his rich Mother in order to give into his growing feelings of love for the Indian beauty.Give it a try, it's harmless enough and when you find yourself swept up in the colorful, flowing costumes, the heart pounding music and exotic ambience of the Indian culture you'll know you are ready for the real thing, subtitles and all!"
5,lots of fun,"Okay, I adore the Pride and Prejudice story anyway, and this is a fun version. Even my husband likes it!Although I do prefer the Keira Knightly standard Pride and Prejudice version, just a bit.But if you like any sort of musicals/Bollywood, or if you like Pride and Prejudice, or if you like quirky rom/coms, give this a try!"
4,Very Bollywood!,"This was cute, just plain cute and very Bollywood! My daughter recommended it. I did not think I would like it but I did although a few of the numbers were a bit long. If you don't like musicals, you will not like this movie.I love Austen, which is why I was leary of watching it, but I am glad I did. It was enjoyable. Not excellent, but good.The stars were great especially Naveen Andrews and Aishwarya Rai (Ash). She is also stunning.If you are looking for a fun, relaxing watch, with a few good laughs, this is a movie to see. I think Ms. Austen would really enjoy this."
3,"Bride and Prejudice - Simple, Different, and Fun","Don't let the first ten minutes throw you off. Keep watching, and the payoff is a pretty cute movie, based on the novel Pride and Prejudice. And a warning here - this movie is a musical! Although it doesn't follow the Austen novel exactly, and a lot of nuance is missing, it still gets the gist of it right. It's fun, it's colorful, and it does give a glimpse of the culture of India. I watched this with my partner, and he liked it better than I did - but it doesn't hurt that the protagonist is drop-dead gorgeous."
4,Bride and Prejudice,"This movie is fun! Do not even try to take it seriously. Bollywood with British attitudes. The connection to Pride and Prejudice is there, but the words ""inspired by"" are accurate. The musical numbers fit well into the storyline. Sets and costumes are colorful without being garish.Lost fans will enjoy Naveen Andrews being a good sport, leading a big dance number. He clearly is not a natural dancer(little out of step and watching his feet) but throws himself right into it making it fun to watch.The actors appear to be enjoying themselves, and therefore give good performances. Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson are believable as the reluctant lovers. Anupam Kher is a delight to watch as the beleaguered father. Nadira Babbar almost steals the show as the mother desperate to see her daughters marry.Overall Gurinder Chaha has done an excellent job of bringing Bollywood and Britain together."
4,Fabulous but way too American,"From the director of Bend it Like Beckham comes this delightful modern hybrid Hollywood/Bollywood musical loosely retelling Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice. This is a funny and entertaining tale of an Indian family trying to marry off their 4 attractive daughters to wealthy American businessmen. It is told in Bollywood fashion in a swirl of exotic sounds and music, dance, vibrant colors and comic misunderstandings where opposites continue to attract and repel each other in a riotous romance with a happy ending for all. Shot on location in India, London and LosAngeles. And yes it stars my favorite actress Aishwarya Rai. My only criticism is, the music is way too American and totally in English."
4,Bride and Prejudice,"This a twist on the Classic Pride and Prejudice, It is a musical that is fun the young girls in my family really like it and I don't mind sitting down to a musical at all."
4,A single man of large fortune must be in want of a wife...,"Transplanting the plot of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to modern India sounded like a stretch to me but it works. Purists will scoff but this version maintains the wit, social commentary, and heart of the original story. An Indian family with 4 daughters (seems Kitty wasn't necessary to the plot) has a mother determined to wed the girls before they get too old. At a wedding, they are introduced to the Bingley character and his sister (they eliminated the Hursts) and Darcy (a rich American). So there's the cross cultural problems and the class problems and the resultant misunderstandings.Now add to this the Bollywood musical numbers and set piece and you have a wonderfully, delightful retelling that's original and moving. And if you listen carefully, lines directly from the book are used and fit naturally into the dialogue. A surprising treasure."
3,GREAT movie not so great quality,"I fell in love in with this movie a few years ago and was so excited to be able to find this movie on DVD so that I could watch it over and over. I am a hopeless romantic at heart. My only disappoint, and it really is minor, but it says region one (which is no problem as I bought from Amazon a multi-code player) so I figured it would play easily on my computer---alas it did not. This is just frustrating as I enjoy the ease and picture quality of watching things on my computer. All other movies I have play on my computer, even my Bollywood movies. Oh well, still LOVE the story."
3,Interesting,"I bought this movie because I needed to use it for a class. Overall, it's very entertaining if you like musicals. It is also nice how the topic of love and intercultural marriage is presented in the movie."
5,Bride & Predjudice DVD Review,"I bought the movie Bride and Prejudice because I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and it sounded like the story line was the same and would be just as good. I wasn't disappointed. I don't believe I had ever seen a Bollywood movie before and I thoroughly loved it. After seeing it I showed it to my daughter, grandchildren and friends who also loved it. I bought 2 more, 1 for my daughter/granddaughters and 1 for a friend who wanted it. I believe the film was just right in the amount of time, not to short or long. My granddaughters range in age from 3 to 11 years old and they watched the whole movie without leaving it. We all continue to watch it over and over. It is a feel good movie with singing and dancing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good love story. I give it a 5 star rating."
5,Buy this movie,"This movie is pure candy. Orange, red, yellow, purple, blue. Music, dance, comedy, light drama. If Pride and Prejudice is your favorite movie, this is your new second favorite."
4,"Fun, but missing something...","It's easy to have certain expectations of Bride & Prejudice - from the character temperaments (based on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice characters) to the bright and colorful set. The filmmaker does a really good job of bringing the characters to modern-day India and Los Angeles, and choosing which aspects of each character to modernize. The story really does fit well , and the movie is entertaining to watch, but it's difficult to avoid comparing the story and characters to the original. In that aspect, it tends to come up short.There's just too much being crammed into this film, from trying to fit in all the bits and pieces of Pride & Prejudice and the Bollywood type numbers, that the storyline and character development fall to the side."
5,Loved it! A sweet little gem of a movie!,"This was great! I had seen this previewed in the theatre and just knew I had to see this once it came out! I am a fan of all things Austen, but this is a completely stand alone movie! You don't even have to love Pride and Prejudice to appreciate this gem. Even my husband had a great time watching it and he has never seen Pride and Prejudice. In fact it fostered a curiosity to watch it I think, because every five minutes he was asking me about various characters and if it was the same as Jane Austen's book. Loosely inspired by, never duplicated, this movie can stand on it's own merits. Colorful and beautifully cast you will not be disappointed. A terrific family film!"
1,Terrible movie,"Snoozefest, the characters are beyond cliche.... she has a chip on her shoulder and plays it worse than a silent movie actress, he's the workaholic shy guy ....... just terrible.... waste of money buying it thinking that it was in the 'vein of my Big Fat Greek Wedding'."
1,Getting Tired,"Why is everyone suddingly starting to make Austens book diffrent?It would be just fine if you left the story alone, like Simon Langton(Directed), Andrew Davies(Screenplay), and Sue Birtwistle (Produced)did with the 1995 virson. If you want to see a classic virson of Pride And Prejudice [The REALL title] you should watchthat one. Otherwise, if you never read the book, or not an Jane Austen fan, go ahead and watch it. You might like it."
2,Wow,"I dont think so, dont ruin a classic please keep that indian stuff out of it. If you want to make a movie please come up with your own plot. I did not like the movies and had difficulty finding any stability with the plot. Drop this and pick up Pride and Predejuice the new one. I have seen other bollywood stuff even though this was kinda hollywood and lemme say that it actuvally is hollywood in bombay. Enlgihs movies in hindi with songs and different characters. Also dont be proud after seeing this thinking you go a dose of indian culture(which I am sure most of you have not) this is nothing read a book if you must.But there are better options so cjoose wisely. But one of these guys is in Lost so I will give it 2 stars(Sayid)."
5,Beautiful Sounds,This XMas CD with the Vienna Choir Boys is absolutely beautiful. The offerings of music are truly inspirational and are timeless. Am very happy I bought it at such a great price.
2,"Depressing, dispiriting","I found this album -- these arrangements, selections, directing/conducting, and even singing -- to be often depressing and dispiriting, and therefore I don't listen to it. Even the occasional presence of Placido Domingo does not remedy or rescue the situation. The Vienna Choir Boys are more renowned in name than in talent or directorship; they used to be a big name in the 60s or so, but trying to capitalize on them in the 1980s or early 1990s did not prove worthwhile in my opinion."
4,A must for Celtic Frost fans.......,"While many of the bands on this compilation stuck to faithful renditions of these Celtic Frost classics, a couple of them did distinguish themselves. GRAVE did a respectable version of ""Mesmerized"" while EMPEROR remade the HELLHAMMER song ""Massacra."" The funny thing about the EMPEROR cover is that the production is almost identical to the production of the original version. We may never know if this was done on purpose or not.... All in all, if you are a true die-hard Celtic Frost fan.... this is a must-have."
2,"Die-hard ""Frosties"" might be interested","A compilation of (mostly) Celtic Frost wanna-be's. Although there are some listenable, if not good renditions here, none really hold a candle to the original CF, except Opeth's version of ""Circle of the Tyrants."" Grave does a decent job with ""Mesmerized,"" and Inner Thought's version of ""Morbid Tales"" isn't bad, although the drum machine is a little annoying. I have no idea what T.G. Warrior's new band Appollyon's Sun is doing on here, but listening to their version of ""Babylon Fell"" conjures images of Cold Lake (makes me shudder in disgust). Finally, what's the deal with Closedown? Their version of ""Danse Macabre"" sounds like a fat lady leaning on a synthesizer for 12 minutes. What a waste of CD space."
2,GOOD DEED BUT..................,"Hey, this is one of the great bands of the heavy metal hay day, they were way ahead of thier time as far as thier sound is concerned. AS far as this tribute album goes, its' a great thing to pay tribute but don't waste your money, these bands do more damage to the CF songs they cover than they do good. Buy an album by the originals in stead."
3,Looks great but not comfortable,"The chair has attractive design & color. The price is good too & the assembly was easy.But it is not a comfortable chair to sit on for any extended length of time. The seat cushion is most inadequate & thin. There is a lack of enough support under the knee areas. The arm rests, while looking pretty, are way too short & set too far back for comfortable use.I will not recommend this chair if you plan to sit on it for more than an hour at a time."
5,Shop here!,"All orders were as described and arrived as scheduled. I always shop here because it's easy and reliable, plus save's time and money."
4,"It's Whipped Cream, Not Beef Jerky","""Nacho Libre"" is admittedly a minor film, but it has an undeniable charm. It should be judged in the spirit in which it was written.Its appeal does not lie in its slight story line. To lambaste it for being predictable or insubstantial on this score is to miss the point, to criticize what is whipped cream for not being beef jerky. The whipped cream in question is the marvelous clowning of Jack Black, both physical and even verbal. The film is an excuse for him to display his comedic talents, and here he is ably abetted by the odd-looking, shrieking, frankly hilarious Hector Jimenez. In addition, we have a troupe of children with whom Black as usual works particularly well. It's as if kids recognize him, despite his raunchiness, as a natural ally, the biggest kid of all. Add to this a beautiful heroine and some beautiful photography of Oaxaca and its environs, and the film becomes a fine light entertainment."
3,Not the greatest movie ever - but entertaining and funny,"My kids (15 and 17) didn't really care for the movie, but my husband and I laughed a lot! A lot of it is really stupid, but it was entertaining, and that's what we went to the movies for."
4,Great movie that you can watch with your kids,"I watched this movie expecting something totaly different that what I got. Usually that is a bad thing, but not in this case. Jack Blacks unique brand of humor really shines through. I laughed out loud several times, and have found that I am finding more to laugh at, the more times I see it. You see, my kids have fallen in love with this movie, and I have seen it 10 times at least. It's a genuinely funny movie that doesn't resort to anything vulgar. The message is really good too."
4,goofy but i love it,I dont know why but I'm hooked on the sillyness of this movie. I have watched it dozens of times. Made me finally like Jack Black. I find it has great re watchability. glad I bought it.
1,"Correct movie, wrong region","I ordered this movie as I have been looking for it for some time. I received it and gave as a Christmas gift. All sat down to watch only to discover it is a region 2 movie and not compatible with DVD players in the US. I've learned this the hard way before and always check for this now. I don't know how this occurred, but not worth my time or expense to return it. My other issue is that this important information is not more obvious to the consumer. You have to dig to find it. Long story short, love the movie; unsatisfactory product and purchase."
1,DVD Does NOT Play,The DVD was a gift for my daughter...so it took me a while to open it...and figure out that the DVd does not play. Not happy.
1,Jack Black should be used as a minor supporting player only,"Jack Black should be one of those characters in a surveilance trailor or an otherwise minor character who is on screen less than five minutes during an entire movie. He can be ""Jack Black"" for those five minutes with his incredibly stupid comments not ruining the film. Making him a ""leading"" actor only succeeds in dooming whatever movie he is in. He cannot act. All he does is make ""teenage humor"" remarks that are never funny and usually not relevant to the movie he is in (this is especially true of the movie ""Gulliver"" which may even be worst than this one).This movie is so incredibly bad, anyone who watches it must be a die-hard Jack Black fan."
1,Region???,"Hi, I got this for my dad for Christmas and we went to watch it tonight and there was a region error. I had no idea that there were such things as regions on DVDs, nor did I know that tis DVD in particular came from Ireland. I am extremely upset as I paid ones for something I cannot watch."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,I watched this movie with my wife and little boy the other night and near the end I fell asleep. I bought it used and even that was a waste of my money. Don't waste your time watching this. You'll be more entertained watching a fly buzz around in a room then allowing this movie to show up on the screen. WEAK! If I could I wouldn't even give it 1 star.
1,Nacho Dud-o,"This is a colossal disapointment!, not funny at all! I am really tired of Hollywood taking digs at the ""Gospel""! You lost it on this one Jack, I have liked everything you have done up till this one, oh, and you were terrific in ""King Kong"", loved it! If you offend easily, stay clear of this one!"
2,Not enough laughs...too many yawns,"30 minutes into the movie, I was picking my toes and making shadow puppets; decided that was more interesting and turn movie off...nuff said!"
5,Movie for the ages,"Jared Hess' comedy starring Jack Black is funny and light hearted. It is a great family film, and perfect for all ages.Jack Black plays Mexican priest Ignacio, who has a secret desire to become a luchador. When he is fed up with being the underdog, he enlists the help of Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) to become a great wrestler.The movie is hilarious, from start to finish, filled with clean humor that leaves you laughing long after the credits roll. My family and I are constantly drawn to the foolish antics of Nacho and Esqueleto; even after watching the movie countless times, we still find it just as hilarious as the first time.Jack Black does an excellent job portraying the outcast in the monastery, while Hector Jimenez is amazing as the sidekick. The movie is heartwarming and fun, and is definitely a must-see for all ages."
4,Classic,"Anyone who has lived in Mexico will appreciate the humor of Nacho Libre. I like most of Jack Black's films and felt he was perfectly cast for his role in this film. I am not one to buy many movies, but went ahead and purchased this one. It is appropriate for all ages making it easy to watch when company shows-up and need some entertainment."
3,Good if you like Jack Black,"I thought the movie was OK and the Blu-Ray transfer is good but nothing spectacular about either. The humor just seemed really uneven, like the movie was relying more on Jack Black being Jack Black than actually having a good, funny script."
2,I thought it would be 1 star...,"but on a snowy afternoon in northern Maine, after snowmobiling,this gave me a couple of laughs more than I figured."
4,I laugh a little harder each time I watch it...,My wife played this for me and the kids on Father's Day. We laughed during the whole movie. Thanks hun... :)
2,dreary,"What can I say? I have looked through the other reviews and can hardly disagree with the consensus. Therefore I will unnecessarily write yet another review that will simply repeat everything that's already been said.Yes, what a slog. Though a fan of Jack Black, I was both shocked and saddened to see him in this tedious tripe.I suppose the script's premise must have seemed a lot more hilarious on paper than it turned out to be once they hitched Black up in those turquoise tights.There are very few laughs. I think in large part this is because Black is harnessed: forced to deliver all his lines through his clenched and rigid Mexican accent.But whatever your theory is, you gotta agree: there are very few laughs."
3,Salads for the Children,"Jack Black plays Nacho in ""Nacho Libre"", a monk who works at a Mexican orphanage. He's the cook, and sometimes he just has gruel for the children, which doesn't please anyone. He gets into wrestling, with a disguise and a tag partner, and starts making some more money for salads for the children. Even though he often loses, he's very entertaining, and because of this he still gets paid. He's also in love with a nun...I think Jared Hess, the director, has a really exciting and unique style. Trouble is, the script isn't the best one he's had to work with. It hold's together fairly good, but there are some pretty hammy and cheesy moments about. Looks like they had a lot of fun though.Three and a half stars."
2,"""Nacho Libre"" Coming To DVD - 10/24/06","The Jack Black bomb ""Nacho Libre"" will limp to DVD in widescreen & full-screen versions on 10/24/06. Special features are still pending. It ain't a great movie. Trust me on this one."
2,Jared Hess > Ed Wood,I never thought it was possible to make a bad unfun film with Jack Black but Nacho Libre proves that Napoleon Dynamite was no fluke. Jared Hess is that bad.I like how the atheist character hates orphans for no reason at all and then finds God for no apparent reason at the end. Wait. No I don't. As a black man he offended me with LaFonda in ND and here with the evil atheist kid who coindicentally is also the ugliest character in the film. Just because you don't follow a religion doesn't mean your some hell spawn who wants to kill children. Way to encourage an awful stereotype that lingers in so many American minds and got that monkey in the White House re-elected.I'd give it one star except for the fact that Jack Black looks sexy in those tights. He is one fine piece of man.
2,pointless and flakey,"Jack Black was great in School of Rock. But he is more of a liability than an asset in his recent movies including King Kong and now Nacho Libre. I popped this into the player and sat back wondering what the hell was going on. Besides the pointless plot, the movie is just not funny. Watching Black run around shirtless, occansionally farting, and getting beat up is only funny for so long. The HD DVD picture quality was decent, but it certainly did not make this movie worth watching."
4,goofy,definitely a goofy movie. i like jack black so i like the movie. you may not like it if you're not a huge fan of him.
2,Lacks Typical Jack Black Funniness,"I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career."
3,Funny,"I've seen this several times. Has a funny plot, great picture, likeable music and characters. Has some crude humor, and similarities to Napoleon Dynamite."
5,I thought it was hilarious!!!,"Most people that I've talked to that have seen it either absolutely love it, or they think it's blah. No in between. I thought I was going to hate it because it just looked like such a dumb story. I refused to rent it, but my wife really wanted to see it. I gave in and to my surprise I laughed my @$$ off. I think English speaking people of Hispanic heritage (me included) would find it hard not to like this movie. Jack's Spanish accent and facial gestures are so funny. My family has watched this movie over and over."
3,Nacho Libre Not Mucho Funny,"This movie was a bit of a let-down from what I was led to expect. It was amusing at times and good for chuckles but hardly a guffawing laugh riot. The wrestling scenes of the friar-by-day, pro-wrestler-by-night Jack Black were of course the highlights and entertaining enough to make this show worth watching.""Nacho Libre"" mines the old Hollywood shaft of convention: Clod dreams of something better, clod gets disappointed repeatedly, clod miraculously pulls it out at the end. This is a decent, lightweight effort that also shows a surprisingly agile Jack Black. Who says fat guys aren't nimble?"
5,"Sadly, one of a kind","This is such an unrealistic story. Its goofy and rediculous. You have to actually have a sense of humor to enjoy it. Jack Black is awesome in this movie and his hispanic accent is (usually) really convincing and incredibly funny. Anyone who is of hispanic origin or has been around latino culture will enjoy this movie especially much. I've seen it about 50 times and it still makes me laugh until I cry. Sure there are some completely off-base jokes that fall way short of actually being funny, but these somehow still manage to make the funny parts even more so. This is a great, GREAT movie!"
4,"""Sometimes when a man is alone in his room, he likes to wear stretchy pants.""","That was the best line in the movie. This movie was not as good as ""Napoleon Dynamite"" but I think it is still one of my top 10 favorite movies. I dont see why people complain about Jack Black's bad accent, its one of the funniest things in the movie.You should see this movie!"
3,Nacho Libre,Jack Black as a Mexican wrestler: Need I say any more? It is entertaining but largely forgettable. You've been warned!
5,Great,This movie is fantastic !! Its watched at least once a month by our family. If you like Jack Black you will love this.
5,Great Movie!,"I had owned this title since first came out on DVD. Now I definitely had to get it on blu-ray because I love this movie. Jack Black makes me laugh so hard every time in his Nacho character. Being latina I Love everything about this movie,the ironic supposed Hispanic wanna be accent with more of a Italian sound he makes! The scenic views in this movie bring childhood memories of my Grandma's little town. I watch this movie at least once a month, so much innocent stupidity going on. Great creation, a genius piece in its own way!"
3,Used Nacho Libre DVD,"This movie was not securely in the case. When I opened it, it nearly fell out, which may have caused more damage to it on the way here. HOWEVER, it played just fine in the dvd player. Therefore I am happy with this product. It was a birthday gift for my boyfriend. It's his favorite movie and I haven't heard any complaints from him about it."
3,Nacho Libe,I bought this movie for my daughter she had misplace the first one. She always like the movie and so now her son is watching and prtending to do everything they are doing in the movie
4,"Good, nice, funny","This movie is a nice one for all audiences that shows a tender point of view of humor, jack Black acting is versatile and let people knows his talents. Other characters as ESQUELETO enrich the movie with funny acting. The music drives you to the past decades when luchadores were real stars in Latin America."
2,Dissappointing,"I went to see this movie when it first was in theatres. I think what ruined it was the ad campaign. Now, I don't watch TV a lot, but I saw so many ads for this movie that by the time it came out I knew: the main story line, most of the jokes, all the main characters, what the climax scene would be (the big fight), etc. In other words, no surprises. Good comedy relies on surprise. This is why Napolean Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine were so good; the humor was totally unexpected and fresh and you went into the theatre not knowing anything about the movies.It may be funnier if you don't know ANYTHING about it. For me, it was a loss."
2,"fast shipping, lousy product",Product came quickly but it was so scratched that halfway thru the movie you could only hear what they were saying with a blue screen. would NOT recommend this product.
2,box broken,"I knew the movie was funny and good. This was a gift. When I received the movie from Amazon, i noticed the celophane had a 'slice' in it, but kept it anyway. Didn't appear to be an issue. I presented the gift. When it was unwrapped and completely open, the box was cracked, and one of the closure tabs was broken off. I felt embarrased giving a damaged gift. The receipient said the movie disk was fine and it was not a problem to him. I was still embarrased. Will be hesitant to order a movie from Amazon again. They need better quality control on products shipped."
3,"Jack Black, need I say more?","This is absolutely dumb humor! If you are feeling silly, it will be funny. If you aren't feeling silly, don't watch it! :)"
4,"FUNNY, BUT........","This movie was funny, but could have been better. Jack Black is great, but the story lacked something. Maybe because Nickleodeon made it, and if they'd let MTV do the job, it could've been as clever as Napoleon Dynamite? It's still worth a watch, and would be a good addition to your DVD collection...."
1,Poor production quality,"I puschased both volume one and two. Neither volume will play in either of our DVD players. The picture freezes while audio proceeds, then the picture leaps ahead. The DVD playback is so choppy they are unusable. They will only play in the DVD rom drive of my home computer."
1,Terrible,"I bought this entire series and not one of the DVDs will play on my machines. I have tried them on two DVD players and on my computer and all they do is freeze. This is too bad because the instructor, GM Chun Sik Kim, is very good and it would have been nice to see how he does his forms.Mike Shaw6th Degree BB Tang Soo Do"
5,Wonderful Images; Beautifully Written Commentary,John Szarkowski has selected 100 worthwhile images and has crafted exceptionally well written commentary about each image. The value of the collection far exceeds the sum of the parts. The book is an education about photography. It doesn't matter how much you like an image or agree with the commentary because by seeing the image and reading the commentary you will learn about photography and about life.
4,toy pistol,"i bought this for my 4 yr. old,and he loves it,if you have a kiddo who loves playing with toy guns go ahead and get it for them,but dont waste your money on the caps cause they dont work at all with the gun."
2,Doesn't fire caps,"The gun was OK, but we wanted a cap gun, and ordered roll caps along with it - and it DOES NOT fire caps as advertised."
2,Not Roll caps,This gun doen not fire roll caps but the other kind. Ordered roll caps and I dont need them. other wise its all good.
3,Scrabble Fan,"I am a scrabble fan and the only thing with this particular game is that the board is too flimsy. Otherwise, it is a great table top decoration and it will be used when traveling. Better than the tiny travel scrabble. But as I said, the board is not good because it folds and does not lay flat when using.The service of this vendor was perfect and I thank them."
3,Save Up for a Better Edition,"I love scrabble but this one isn't stable, doesn't hold the tiles and kinda cheaply made. I didn't realize it at the time of purchasing but having a board that holds and rotates is essential for game play. Save up for a better edition of the game."
3,Very touching and compelling,"I knew of David Smith through a mutual friend of ours,and after hearing of this senseless trajedy bestowed upon him,I knew I had to read this book to learn more about his life with Susan,and how he has dealt with the death of his 2 young sons. I found myself getting very teary eyed when he talked about his children,and could only imagine the pain he must have gone through.I enjoyed the book alot,as it let me know David alot more than I knew him before."
3,Aspiring writer's should read this one!,"If you are interested in becoming a writer ""Beyond All Reason""- ""My Life With Susan Smith"" is a a good example of how skilled writers - in this case the husband-and-wife writing team called ""Carol Calef"" does a masterful job of editing an amazing collection of often trivial items to make it an intensely readable book for many people. The deft selection of small details brought into the story at exactly the right time do much to determine the reader's end feelings about this much publicized. For writers this is an exercise in the proper use of words to achieve a desired over-all impression."
5,Very Interesting,"I did agree with the man who said this book is poorly edited, but David Smith did not set out to be a writer. He was just a regular guy until this tragedy happened to him. So I can't criticize him for those mistakes. I honestly believe him when he said he did not write this book to make the money, but instead he felt like it was a step towards the healing process. I feel so sorry for what happened to this man.The book was a very fast read and very hard to put down from the first page. I really think it was interesting to find out what was actually happening during that 9 day period. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in that story. And, I do agree with David Smith....everyone needs to remember who the REAL victims were."
3,Puh-lease....,"I have read this book several times, and have compared it with her mother's book, ""My Daughter Susan Smith"". David does come clean that he was unfaithful, treated her like crap, etc. But there was always a but.... As if to justify his deeds. He said that Tiffany was warm and friendly while Susan was disapproving and cold. Well, hindsight is 20/20.. He admitted he carried on adulterous relationships, but it was not OK for Susan to. I am in no way excusing her horrific act. In fact, I bought these books trying to figure out HOW she could have done that?!? But both books, this one, and the one written by the mother, both are eager to share their disdain for the other, and blame, blame, blame."
4,Non-tool use.,"It works well for runs. It is not as good for connecting to tools. However, the clear heavy duty version of this is expensive and this will do the job if your willing to take the disconfort."
2,cheap-o,"I could not get the hose to fit over any other manufacturer's 4"" fittings. I had to split it and then tape it closed. I have a system going from 6"" mains, mostly 5"" drops; just a few 4"" connections off a wye at the bandsaw and router table. Everything else worked well together except this hose."
3,Not bad for stationary aplications,"I selected this product on basis of price alone (don't do that!). The hose works well with my 2 1/2 HP dust collector. The problem I have with it is I'm switching it between 3 different machines. As time has gone by (6 months) the ridges have started to fatigue and the hose is 'kinking' in places. My estimation is this hose would be fine if left stationary. For a moving configuration, buy something with more flex."
4,BUY THE 20 FOOT HOSE INSTEAD,I PURCHASED THIS BEFORE I REALIZED I COULD HAVE PURCHASED TWICE AS MUCH FOR A ABOUT THREE BUCKS MORE.Jet JW1032 4-Inch x 20-Foot Black Dust Collection Hose
1,Not worth the wait,"Clumsy, hard to bend and makes the job twice as hard. Not recommend it for home project. Check your local hardware store for better product. Even better price for that matter."
1,Dust collection or irragation?,"This is very much a rip off. This hose is nothing more than 4"" corrugated drain pipe. You can get a 100 feet of this stuff online for 50 bucks! [...] So tell me, why are we paying 15 bucks for 10 feet. That would be 3x the price it sells for at hardware stores. I'm totally pissed that I bought this. For just about the same price you can buy a dust collection hose that not only is flexible but will fold up like an accordion when not in use. Either jet is trying to pull the wool over our eyes, or someone at Outlet Tool Supply is."
3,"hmm, better than alot of [stuff] out there, but nothing special","I like many different kinds of extreme music, ranging from death metal to black metal to hardcore to doom to gothic to punk to even some new age. This cd is ok for anybody into stoner doom stuff, like maybe Cathedral or something. It's just not really my thing. I find it kind of boring and the cd, for the most part, collects dust. I can't really distinguish any song from the rest. It sort of has that industrial doom sound to it, like say Godflesh or something. I suggest listening to some sound sample before you buy it."
5,"A good, old-fashioned historial novel","I was captivated by this new writer's book: a fictional work based on the life of the real Dracula. It reminded me of the great literature of the past--- a Victor Hugo type novel in which you become involved in characters you care about, you experience a great sense of time and place, and you get a valuable history lesson--all at the same time. ""The Historian"" may be getting all the publicity, but this serious novel is a little gem for those truly interested in the life of Vlad Voivod, Prince Vlad --""Dracula""."
5,Outstanding historical novel,"Do you crave unsurpassed excitement and gripping adventure? Then read this brilliant and powerful spellbinding masterpiece about the much maligned Prince Vlad, a heroic aristocrat warrior. M. Grossman's beautifully narrated and extraordinary monumental epic novel with its unforgettable characters and brutal action will surely secure its place among the best literature of this complex and riveting era."
1,History??? PLEASE,"This book reads well as a fantasy but only a fantasy. The Real Dracula called down bats and followed grey wolves into the mountains? Please...Further...The idea that the stake was JUSTICE is absolutely ridiculous. Stealing food or money brings on Tzapa? Common..Oh and the idea that the homeless...yes the homeless....which were COMPLETELY made out to be criminals in this book, being led to dinner and burned alive...JUSTICE? REASON? Absurd.The Impaler fought Islamic invaders which gives him some credance. He is thought of as a hero by some of his country now.He was NOT loved in his time by his people. He was followed from fear and from lust for plunder which any warrior prince promised his legions.It is interesting that everyone who would think that Vlad was wrong,crazy, just plain animalistic, are made out to be betrayers, usurpers, and just plain ignorant....as a fantasy I'd give the book a B-As history it gets an F"
3,"Good reference, though a little vague.","This was a good reference, but it wasn't that comprehensive. This book is really more useful if you're using it to find out about future reading. There were numerous sources in this book that I ended up reading, that I wouldn't have known about otherwise. This book is really big to be so vague though. There were a lot of chapters I found a little repetitive because they could have easily been combined with other chapters of the book. It also tends to repeat itself a lot, which I guess is good if you have a really short memory, but since I read this book fairly quickly it sort of bugged me. It is a good book overall, since it is sort of a gateway to other reading. After I read this book I tracked down several of the resources that were sited, so I have to thank this book for pointing me in the direction of several good reads. Even with all the criticism I've given the book, I would probably still buy it over again."
3,Only for Class,This was required for a class I took. I'm not a book reader so I only read what was required. Well written and does a good job of keeping you engaged in some topics. Great price for a lot of words. Even came with a book marker from the store who sent it.
5,Bruce BecVar captures The Nature of Things,"I don't even know where to start. My first and favorite of BecVar's recordings, this piece of art has to God-inspired. Since its' release, I stumble upon it every few years, and then have to force myself to remove it from the car or the home player for fear I am becoming too fixated. I cannot get enough. This composer creates melodies, arrangements, and manipulates the acoutical guitar that catalyzes a lifting of heart and soul, if not an out of body experience. His mastership of acoustical guitar inspires me to think about taking up the instrument. His very unique style cannot be pigeon-holed into any musical category that I am aware of. Bruce BecVar, thank you for sharing the gift of your talents."
2,Blastgate Needed - Not This One!,"With a blastgate at each machine, you can control the air flow from the DC unit as if you only had one machine hooked up, providing the most efficient use of the air suction. By opening and closing each blastgate, as needed, you will get the maximum amount of air flow at all times.For a more ""durable"" blastgate, there is a metal version available at a premium. But I have found the plastic gates run into problems with use. They jam with debris and cannot be taken apart to clean. The spot welds, which hold them together, will lossen with use, then the sliding gate, which is a friction function, will not operate properly. The metal gate uses a screw to kept the gate open.Overall, it is a needed product that allows for maximum use of a dust collection system, with a blastgate installed at each branch to control the air flow to the machine in use. BUT, do not invest in the plastic version, go with the metal blastgate."
1,Scratching my head!,"If someone can explain to me what the tapered design of the inlet and outlets are for, I'll upgrade the review to 5 stars minus 2 for the overbloated price.I can't imagine what the design of a taper is for. The Y-Connectors and Splices do not have a taper. Why do the blastgates do?The problem is that the natural springness of the hose keeps it coming off the tapered outlets just as you're trying to tighten the clamps. This is frustrating to just a wee degree since the problem shouldn't exist at all. In addition, the price is just a tad expensive for a piece of plastic.Look elsewhere if you can find a better design, or a better price. Otherwise, once you have them on, they work as expected."
1,Dont waste your time,I would not buy these. They jam with dust. These do not come apart for cleanout. These will only work in a dust free shop. (A shop that is not used.) I recommend the metal gate at the same price. The metal gate is sturdy and solid.
1,It broke,"I purchased three of the plastic blast gates. I put one in line to my TS to see how it worked. It pulled apart pretty quickly as I moved the TS. This is an inexpensive product but I did expect it to be stronger.Secondly, I replaced the gate and the slide would not stay up. I had to turn it sideways to keep it from closing by itself."
1,wasted my money,"I bought these plastic blastgates because they were cheaper than aluminum. What a waste of money! I broke two of them while installing, the slots jam up with chips, and they cannot be taken apart for cleaning. As my funds allow, I will be replacing the plastic with aluminum."
1,HORRIBLE! STAY AWAY,I'm an occasional woodworker and currently replacing all 5 of my Jet blast gates - typical reasons...they clog with dust and therefore can't be fully closed. 2 of mine have also come apart (the front panel piece came unglued).This product is a lemon.
4,Owner/Operator-Blastgate review,This product is a great deal at its current price. I modify it and use for a particular need in my business.
1,Only for people who love music more as a puzzle than an art,"This book tried to do for tonal music what Chomsky's work did for language. That is, come up with a theory that is dominant in its field in academia, has tremendous prestige, but ends up having almost no explanatory ability for how language or music actually works in the real world. The book is tedious with only a few interesting points.The book has been in print more than twenty years (and that amazes me), but has had almost no impact on any musician outside of a small circle of academic thinkers for whom music is more of a technical and arcane game / puzzle than an art of expression and emotion. In fact, bringing up emotion and expression will cause immediate laughter and a great many derisive comments.Save your time and money. Whenever I am tempted to read a book like this, I realize how little time I get to play my piano. So, I go do that instead and find it a much better use of my time."
4,good role model for girls,This is a children's biography on Gertrude Ederle. It tells of her life starting with her childhood. We learn that she almost drown as a child and this made her father want to teach her to swim. I learned that she was brave and determined. She worked hard to reach her swimming golas. She won many awards for her swimming races.I enjoyed learning about a new person. I had never heard of Gertrude Ederle before I read this book.We would recommend this book. Gertrude Ederle is a good perosn to study. She would make a great role model for girls. Especially girls who are interested in swimming..
3,not suitable for MAC or wardriving,Well when I got the card I was disappointed to see no external antenna port. I will see if there is a restocking fee. The documentation that I read stated that it did have it. The only ones good for war driving is the old Gold classic i think its an 8421 or something in that range. Also it doesnt work too good on a Mac. This is meant to be the creme-de-la creme of cards. hmm more like cream of a filet-o-fish.
3,I also thought it had an external antenna connector,I had the same problem - it turns out the card with the external antenna connector is the Orinoco 11b/g PC Card Gold.
3,It's a pepper mill...,"""18/10 brushed stainless steel with glass peppercorn chamber""Incorrect, the chamber is PLASTIC, I find that very disappointing as it was one of the features I was looking for. The SS is, well, what China puts out to the masses... as for functionality, it seems to mill fairly well and quickly. My unit probably needs to be broken in a little as the grain consistency is a bit hit and miss, this is to be expected on brand new grinding mechanism. Got it on the 4 for 3 deal, so I guess the price was alright for what you get in the end."
2,"Used to LOVE it, now I HATE it.","If you'd asked me a month after I bought this pepper mill, I'd swear by it. Now, six months later, it doesn't work at all. The grinder jams after about two seconds of grinding. Don't know if the motor is dead, too weak to grind or just jammed somewhere. If I'd paid $10 for it, I'd say it had a good life, but for the price it's just not worth it.You may get a longer life out of yours, and I hope you do, but don't count on it."
1,Has never worked properly,"I received this as a gift, and it actually will grind peppercorns for about 3 seconds before the mechanism stops working. It continues to try to turn the grinder, but the grinder itself stops moving. Total waste of money."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I have had this pepper mill less than a year, what a waste of money! When it did work not much pepper came out of it. Now with fresh brand new batteries it wont work at all. Dont waste your money on this!"
2,not worth the money,"The MIU France peppermill with light grinds the pepper well, but the problem for me came when I removed the slip-on cover to re-fill. The cover will no longer lock back into place; it slips off and the grinder just falls down when you pick it up by the cover. You can't hold the mill and push the grind button on the top without it staying in place - not to mention all the batteries showing. UGH! it's really unusable now even though it still grinds."
2,"2nd one, and problems again","the first one arrived and the light didn't work, the replacement, the second one arrived and it barely ground pepper. No more for chances, I'm going for a different brand!"
3,Insufficient control of pepper size,"This unit works fine.However, do not expect much control over the granularity of your pepper.I tested by setting out a white paper towel and setting the grid level using the knob to six different settings.There is *very* little difference from coarse to fine...and fine contains chunks of pepper.AddendumThe new shipments do NOT include the six AA batteries."
2,poorly designed on-off control,"I love the speed at which I can grind a lot of pepper with this for preparing large dishes. However, the button often gets stuck in the ""on"" position, so this is not useful when you need to grind small amounts on an individual dish. In fact, the button often turns on when the mill gets bumped accidentally. I have ground a lot of pepper onto the shelf in my kitchen cupboard! My husband hates this mill, despite his love for pepper."
2,sent back,i thought i was gettin 2 grinders and so was disappointed but would have been great for one one !
2,stop breaking!!!,"I loved this product when I received it for Christmas and up until the day that it broke. My husband accidentally knocked it over on the counter and it stopped working. I thought it was odd that it broke so easily, that I thought something must have been wrong with it before and so I purchased another one. Well, within 5 weeks the same thing happened and it stopped working."
1,Very disappointing product,We had one of these and it worked well for a few years. I suggested it to my sister. Hers never worked well and totally stopped when it was less than 6 months old. When I had to replace mine this summer I had the same experience as my sister. My second MIU pepper mill never ground well and it has now just stopped. I cannot recommend this product at all.
5,A Great (and Fun) Peppermill,"My husband and I bought the MIU electric peppermill for my husband's 94-year-old father for Father's Day. My father-in-law loves pepper and uses a lot of it on many foods. He always complained that he couldn't get enough pepper out of a conventional shaker, so we decided this was the perfect gift for him. He absolutely loves it and also appreciates the fact that it's lighted, as his eyesight is poor. The only downside is that my mother-in-law kept finding plates full of pepper while he was having fun trying it out!"
1,Don't buy it,"There are two serious problems with this pepper mill. First of all, thegrind adjustment doesn't work. You can turn it all you like and thegrind remains unchanged.Second, one of mine died. I was foolish enough to buy twoof these pepper mills (for black and white pepper). One of them died inaround 2 months. The motor just stopped turning. I put in a full set ofnew batteries so that wasn't the problem. I think the motor just burnedout.I just bought a ""Peugeot Elis u-Select Electric Pepper Mill, 8-Inch""(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7O4TO/ref=oss_product). It is alot more expensive but it seems to be working very well. The grindadjustment actually works. I'll review it after I have used it a littlelonger."
1,Product quit working after a week.,"Initially I was very happy with this grinder. It worked as advertised and the size of the grind was perfect. After use for just one week, the motor works, the light still works but it doesn't produce and ground pepper. All attempts to disassemble and reassemble were met with frustration and not ground pepper. BEWARE of this Grinder."
1,Defective,"This unit is badly constructed. We have owned MIU salt and pepper mills for years without issue. When the pepper mill finally gave up the ghost (the salt mill is still working), I ordered a replacement. Other reviewers noticed no difference between fine and coarse grind - it's because the central shaft is too small for the opening that controls the grinder, and that means that the spring that controls the grinder mechanism cannot work. This is not a fixable problem."
1,MIU pepper mill,"Poorly designed. Overpriced. Item would constantly jam up and finally quit working entirely after 2 months of limited use. Have tried to contact the manufacturer, but have had no luck. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Batteries not included!,"It says in the above item description that the 6 AAA batteries are included in the package. The included batteries was one of the reasons I chose this over a similar item. But there are no batteries, the label on the box says they are not included.Other than that, its a nice grinder."
1,Briefly entertaining,"We thought this was really great for the first month. The light was kind of cool (but really unnecessary). The grinder itself was okay. Once the batteries died we had the same problem as another reviewer and it never worked right after that. It was a waste of money (not to mention what you would spend on batteries)!!! I think we'll go back to the ""manual"" pepper grinder. Don't waste your money."
3,Just Ok,"I love this peppermill and had one for many years before it just got old and stopped worked. I ordered 2 new ones, one for me and one for a friend, but neither came like the original. The cover that goes over the pepper grinder at the bottom was not included with any of the peppermills even though the description says it's included. I ended up ordering and returning 4 of these thinking it was just missing the piece, but it turns out the description is wrong and this peppermill no longer includes the cover like my original from many years ago. It's very messy without the cover so I will be looking for a different peppermill. c'est la vie!"
2,Very .....French?,"After purchasing several of these from Amazon, I can confidently say MIU has absolutely no QC in its manufacturing. I have yet to receive any pair of these without serious malfunctions. This includes minor things like the light not working on a Salt mill and the aluminum covering being so poorly glued it takes two hands to use the pepper mill, as well as major malfunctions like the wiring and the mill falling apart. The design is seductive for a purchaser always hoping the next order will be better. I'm now convinced it will not.I also understand why the French ""caved"" in 3 weeks during WWII relying on on fortress that was never completed (Maginot line) and am grateful, truly grateful that my ascending the Eifel Tower did not occur when it collapsed (at some future date).Lee Watson"
1,Big Disappointment,"This peppermill did not work at all. Not once.To load the batteries and the peppercorns, you have to detach the top half of the mill from the bottom half. No problem. But when you try to reconnect them, BIG problem. The two halves are supposed to click in place with a half turn, but the catch doesn't work. A couple of times, I THOUGHT the catch was engaged, but upon picking the mill up, the two halves disconnected and went tumbling to the countertop -- spraying batteries and peppercorns everywhere. This gets old FAST. I really didn't want to return the product, so I tried repeatedly to get it to work. Finally, however, I had no choice -- the thing simply didn't work. My guess is, the product is just cheaply made. A simple half-turn catch like that should work. But it won't if the plastic is cheap and the workmanship sleazy."
4,Electric Peppermill,"It works well, has a light on it. Batteries wear out more often than I would like but it feels good in your hands and is worth it."
4,Great Peppermill,"I bought one of these for myself about 2 years ago. Everyone that uses it loves it! So, now I'm in the process of buying one for each of my friends and family. The only downside is that it takes 6 AAA batteries at a time and they don't last very long."
4,Electric Peppermill,"Product works very well, but it was annoying to receive it without necessary batteries -- six AAA batteries required. It arrived the day before Thanksgiving as planned with expedited shipping but couldn't be used without another trip to a store"
2,peppermill come and gone,Had this peppermill for about a year. Used it regularly. Goes through batteries quickly-needs 4 AAA. The light stopped working in 2 months. You cannot adjust the grind. Loved it while it worked. It is history now.
2,Slower than I thought it would be.,"I started smoking meats so I need a lot of fresh ground pepper; sometimes 3 or 4 tablespoons at a time for a rub recipe. I bought this unit to speed up that process but I found I can grind it faster by hand. If you want this unit to have on the table for your guests I suppose it would be OK. But, you have to hold it a long time if you want a good dose of fresh ground pepper. A hand grinder is faster."
1,Broke after 2 weeks...,"Nice pepper mill, but not durable. Within 2 weeks it got stuck on a particularly hard pepper kernel and it twisted itself into a mangled mess. I was able to remove the top, secure it with tape, and use it for another 6 months before the issue repeated itself and the motor came to a final halt. It looks good and it worked well, those first two week. Would never buy it again."
4,MIU Electric Peppermill,"Although the product itself is fine, the accompanying instructions stated batteries were included (they weren't) and the picture showed a different mechanism for adjusting the grind."
1,WARNING!,"Warning! This CD is NOT by the punk band MEST. It's just some relaxing sounds CD, don't know. Although it says on some pages that it's from MEST and other MEST-fans have bought it, I have not because they didn't make it. So you shouldn't either. Their only albums are Mo Money, Wasting Time and Destination Unknown. That's it."
2,interesting information but not the greatest book,"I found this information to be extremely fascinating, but I don't recommend this book. This book is really lacking with explanation that flows well while painting a picture for the reader. I found myself goggling most questions I had about certain time periods and about the culture rather than finding it in the book. I found the information in this book to be difficult to find and pin point an exact explanation. Other books will be much better."
2,Not terribly great,What's the point. I can get spare wire and wire nuts to ground my system far cheaper than this. i find the braided copper hard to deal with and am far happier using spare romex I have lying around the shop. Do yourself a favor and make one of these yourself.
5,Point Of No Return Back Cover,"""I don't care for wheeler-dealers!"" Even before she knew him personally, Megan dislike Jerome Towers, the wealthy landowner plotting to buy out her family's farm.And when she eventually did meet him, he was as arrogant as she'd expected. Quite unexpectedly, though, she became deeply captivated with him-enough to care what he thought of her in return.She certainly didn't want him to discover that she'd been accused of a scandalous relationship with his half brother, Roddy. But to her utter dismay, Jerome's opinion of her just seemed to grow worse and worse...."
3,Interesting but.....,"Although the author promised no ""red herrings,"" there were several places where you needed some specialized knowledge in order to solve the puzzle. For example, one case requires you to know tire treads.The cases are also largely from England and the book was first published in the early 1900s. Knowing all this, I probably would not have purchased it.I gave the book to a police detective and have not heard anything of his success in solving the cases. On the other hand, he has not arrested me for wasting his time."
5,An excellent vehicle for senior entertainment,"Jules has captured the essence of what seniors are all about, the drama, the emotion, and the reality. A snap to produce, these plays are fun. I have been involved in a number of Jules' plays and would recommend this book to any group of seniors looking to entertain or be entertained."
4,It is something that I would be able to feel,It is something that I would be able to feel at my wedding.
2,Rushed,"This book was interesting, but I found myself thinking didn't I just read that? She repeats certain things throughout the book. I also think that she stereotypes all of Saudi Women of being a certain way, when she know some, not all. I felt like the last part was rushed to finish the book."
2,Allow Me To Burst The 5 Star Bubble,"While Carmen's story is certainly interesting, and probably compelling if one isn't familiar with Saudi Arabia or fundamentalist Islam, it's not exactly a riveting page-turner.In fact, it reads more like a script from Oprah.The writing is weak; the details are few. She covers thirty years of marriage; three babies; an abortion; her relationship with not only a world-renowned terrorist, but also one of the world's most influential families; assorted tidbits about Saudi society; PLUS, an earth-shattering event in all of 200, widely spaced pages.Frankly, if she didn't share her name with Osama, the book would probably have never been published on its own merit.However, if one knows nothing about the Kingdom and its all-too-accurately told oppressive nature, it's a great place to begin research. For those who are familiar with Saudi, Wahabism, and Islamic fundamentalism in general, it's just a trip down another tabloid lane."
2,She sounds like a colonialist writing about the natives - how insulting,"This book is insulting - how can one just view the world only from their lenses... oh my goodness she is insufferable - she had a life better than 98% of the World, she is shopping in Switzerland, tennis socials and soirees --- and YET SHE IS COMPLAINING THROUGH OUT!!! She is another priviledged woman who just wanted to cash on the her Bin Laden lastname .... she knew what family she was marrying into, being in Switzerland she had access to normal regular guys (well her version of normal anyway) -- but she chose a rich porsche driving Saudi heir.... eish!! this book is a disappointment... She could have written a better critique of the nation... oh! what an insufferable woman - her comparisons with the West were not objective at all, too black or white for me.... societies are gray!"
3,Not so informative as it might have been,"I found Jean Sassoon's ""Princess"" three-part trilogy more interesting in its depiction of life for women inside Saudi Arabia. Carmen Bin Ladin's book also takes the perspective of a foreign national, so it is somewhat skewed in that regard.If a princess and wealthy foreign woman can suffer so much under the strict Saudi regime, just imagine what hardships underprivileged Saudi women must face.One author did just that, and in a recently released novel set in contemporary Saudi Arabia, follows the tribulations of a fictional Saudi heroine. The book is called ""Saudi Match Point"" from Blacksmith Books. It's a quick, informative, and enjoyable read."
3,Inside the Kingdom:My Life in Saudi Arabia Carmen Bin Laden,"Having lived in the Kingdom from 1990-1998 I found this book to be factual, however, women who write of their experiences in Saudi Arabia annoy me in relation to the wearing of the Abaya. We all know we have to wear this garment, why go on about it??? It is their country, their custom - so obey the rules. We Westeners all go to the Middle East to make good money for our future, just enjoy the experience and ""go with the flow"". Carmen wrote a very good book, but I sincerely believe in my heart of hearts that her daughters need to change their surname, i.e. Bin Laden, so they will not experience problems, pretty easy really! If you are born with the name ""Hitler"", you would change this for obvious reasons. Good read."
5,Excellent read,"I hate these really long and drawn out reviews so I'll keep it brief. I loved this book at it was written almost from a western point of view. Carmen saw Saudi Arabia as an outsider, not someone born and raised into such oppression. She was a part of the most revered family and as such received special benefits. If you want a look at Saudi life from a perspective you (a westerner) can understand, this is your book. Its very easy to understand and she doesn't dwell on one subject. She covers it all, beginning to end."
4,Looming Crises for Western Women,"The best part of Carmen Bin Ladin's story is her openness and honesty about herself and others, for good or bad. She not only lifts the veil and lets us see the lives of the ultra rich Saudi women she socializes with in their harem world, and how narrow, paranoid, arrogant and selfish they can become as shut-ins, deprived of intellectual stimulation and subject to the absolute power and whims of their fathers, husbands and sons, but she also lifts the veil on parts of her own heart and mind that many of us would prefer to keep private. I think she does that so that we will believe in her and what she is saying about the looming cultural crises as fundamental Wahabi Islam rapidly spreads through both the Moslem and the western world. What Carmen Bin Ladin says is not politically correct but has to be said so that western women hold on to their rare and precious freedoms and are not seduced by an extremist culture that will force them into absolute submission."
5,Food for thought,"I found this book to be very enlightening in pointing out the impasse between the western world and the Saudi way of life. Carmen's descriptions of life in Saudi Arabia mirror what I have read from Jean Sasson's books about Princess Sultana; I can't believe anyone would consider these books fiction! The experiences described in the book made me think about the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, and also lead me to be concerned over the expansion of fundamentalist Islam."
1,Inside the Kingdom:My Life in Saudi Arabia-Carmen BIN LADEN,"Before reading this or even attempting to read it,just looking at her name made me suspect how much knowledge she had of Saudi Arabia or even of her own marriage.For one-Bin Laden means ""the son of Laden""which pretty much blows her credibility out of the water as far as I'm concerned.Obviously,this was written to capitalize on her husband's name-too bad she didn't learn anything or care to learn anything during her marriage."
2,"If you lie down with rats, don't be surprised if you get fleas","The title of my review says it all. Moslems don't think of women as people. I loved the book as it confirmed everything negative about Islam the ""Religion of Peace."" Yeah, right."
4,Inside the Kingdom,"I enjoyed reading this book and could relate to so much of it because I am an American living in the Middle East. I think the average reader would find it interesting, but seeing the culture up close and personal makes it more relatable. She speaks with such candor about the things that she experienced and lived with and lived thru. She was always respectful of the members of the Bin Laden family when she addressed them in the book. Never trying to belittle or demean them but share a view into their life. She just hit so many nails on the head about the way women live and are treated who are a part of this culture. I feel for her and her daughters because though they are no longer tied to the Bin Laden family legally, because of the girls birth right, they will always be Bin Ladens and the world will forever associate them to their uncle Osama and his world. Good easy read!"
4,Daylight Under the Abaya,"Carmen Bin Laden did the world a tremendous favor when she picked up this pen. As enlightening to the western world as it is engaging, I find myself recommending this work to colleagues constantly.I am not sure if the author knows how shocking to americans life in Saudi Arabia is. During the Bush years, most had no idea who these people of the desert kingdom were, other than important-looking robed arabs who liked to kiss and hold hands with Georgie.Carmen Bin Laden lays it bare. With a death sentence back in Saudi Arabia, and the most shunned name since Hitler, she boldly lands the reader in the heart of Saudi life, in the middle of one of the most influential families in the arab world. The insight is extremely unique, and such a text is a rare intellectual treat. I hope we hear more from her."
3,Truthful discourse,"Having lived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for over a year I understand and remember the limitations I felt inside this ""Magic kingdom"". Saudi Arabia is a place where men have it very easy and women are the responsibility of their husbands and fathers/brothers.Carmen Bin Laden is a conscious writer and someone who understands the challenges of living and being married to someone in the kingdom. Recently living in the Kingdom has become much more tolerable however it is still a dictatorship and not a monarchy just as Carmen describes."
3,Limited but real account,"My family and I lived in Saudi in the early to mid-80s. What Carmen bin Laden wrote is factual and we experienced what she did, even as expats. I was hoping for more insight but frankly, one has to read between the lines. It was an easy read, and provides real but limited insight into the kingdom for those who know little about life in Saudi."
5,Women's Inside View,"Incredible! A women's first hand account of the life in the Saudi Kingdom. Sometimes here in the West we just seem so far removed from these issues portrayed in this book and need to realize our culture could change just as rapidly. [9/11 our example]My personal stance has always been as a Christian believer, LORD never send me to Saudi Arabia. I still hold firm to this and also have a heart for the women of Saudi Arabia, that have not experienced 'Freedom' as we know it today in the West.Thank you Carmen for taking us on a journey to the uttermost parts of the earth and giving us a birds eye view of this ancient, closed, religious culture. Your bravery in writing your memoirs are exceptional."
3,Great story.....,"I was rather disappointed that it was not real actors, or even a cartoon. It is nothing but still animation. I did enjoy the pure history of it and the story-telling. Kind of short, though. It left me wanting more."
4,Interesting Story,I enjoyed the story. Within the time frame of the story I felt the characters involved were effectively developed even though it relies on ancient accounts to tell us who the people were.
5,Fatty Liver Relief,"I have been taking this product for over two years. I first started it for a diagnosed fatty liver condition. I felt relief within a week and my liver counts were in the normal range within 6 months. The medical Doctor's recommendation for fatty liver was to eat less fat and no red meat. After seeing my counts back to normal he only said ""keep on doing what ever you are doing"". That is taking two of these capsules each day and eating meat, including red meat once or twice a week."
1,Not durable,"I wouldn't recommend this colander... unless you just want to hang it on the wall for color or something like that. It's very pretty. With regular use, however, the enamel started to chip & the underlying metal began to rust within 4 months. We've had it for about 8 months now and it's completely unusable."
4,Good Consistant Hose,"This is a black 3"" hose, made of ABS plastic. The sizing is very consistent, as I cut it into 3 foot sections, each end maintained 3 inches. The hose is very rigid, almost crushproof, yet flexible enough to move from side to side and up and down and all round. It is not flexible enough, though, to move back and forth (in and out) as if you were moving machinery from the wall to a work area. But it is an excellent hose for permanent pieces of equipment for your dust collection system."
2,Slippin and a' Slidding,"I used both types of band clamps- steel band clamps and wire band clamps- with the ribbed hose in my dust collection system.The steel band clamps slipped more, were harder to control going on and didn't seat as well as the the wire band clamps"
5,Insightful,A well done documentary with the current world's religious leaders: interesting questions and honest answers- offers a rare insight into the private lives and thoughts of these important leaders of today.
5,"Informative, even for the experienced","I have been a professional hunter since 1994 and having worked and lived in countries like Botswana, Tanzania, Republic of the Congo, and Mozambique and having been in Bell's environment, albeit many many years later, his stories and his accounts are absolutely marvelous and it depicts an Africa that once was. His innocent comments on the natives and the abundance of wildlife is an absolute pleasure. Even more delightful, is his casual way of describing how you should go about brain shooting five bull elephant within a matter of seconds...a must for all serious hunters."
2,Too much bragging,This book was purchased for a gift. Unfortunately the recipient isn't enjoying it because the author spends more time bragging up himself than he does telling a good story. I wish I had saved the money.
3,How British actors and cinematographers can season a mediocre script.,"For those of us who cannot get enough of this era of film-making, or of the English of yore, or the impeccable acting talents of British actors, this movie works its magic. As a script, it is a reworking of so many in which a man finds himself facing a jury after a series of mishaps. At the dénouement, the viewer is left to reason for himself what happens because the concluding few minutes of the storyline are a complete muddle. Even the newspaper headline, which is supposed to enlighten the viewer, is cut off at the right-hand side where the operative words are printed. The title is no less abstruse than the ending and can only be guessed by applying a metaphor of one's choosing. For this confusion and for all its ordinariness, the noir-style photography, the acting, the brisk pace of it all, makes the film an enjoyable treat."
4,"5"" blast gate","I needed a 5"" blast gate to connect my large drum sander to dust collection. These are hard not easy to find and the price was very good. The gate is made from plastic like most low end gates. It will not handle a lot of abuse and needs to be cleaned out regularly for it to close all the way. Still it funtions very well and I would buy again if I needed more. Great for the small size wood worker."
4,"Dense, but good","This book is a published dissertation, so it's very thick and can be a slog at times. Still, it's an informative, scholarly look at the roots of the eugenics movement that is a real eye-opener to the role eugenics has played in our culture--a more significant and fundamental role than we would like to admit."
3,broke after a couple of days,"We knew it may not be the best made gun out there. It was only 8 bucks after all. You have to treat it delicately, but it was fun while it lasted and with some superglue, it may be fixed."
1,Just Got It Today & It Broke Already,"I ordered 5 items two weeks and this was the LAST item to come today. I thought it was a good piece until about 2 hours into using it . Not abusing it,just shooting and cocking and the slide came apart and split on top. Looking for a better metal piece."
4,Great for it's price.,"This was my first airsoft gun. A good gun for its price. This gun is not easy to disassemble. There are two screws under the permanently attached grips. Best with .2 bbs.Good:Very powerful for a spring plastic gun.SafetyHop UpEasy to load magazineBad:Breaks when dropped. (Super Glue can fix it)Tiny magazine buttonSometime the Hop Up is too hard. Boomerang.Non working hammerVibrations from shots pops out safety.Update: It's been one year, and the end of this gun is near. I've dropped this gun many times, but with some super glue, everything is fixed. This time when the gun is half cocked, the slide won't move forward. It will if I bang it with my hand. I am going to perform an autopsy to see what has happened, and maybe I can fix it."
3,"decent beginners gun, otherwise dont buy it","i bought this gun for my sun because he wanted airsoft guns and i wanted to see how they worked. i worked at first, but then the mag broke and two metal poles came out of it because it had cracked. like i said it worked at first, its great for a begginer, and if your mag doesnt break like mine it should work pretty good."
1,pice of junk!,I got the airsolf gun 2 day ago i got it in the mail. I whent out to shoot it when i pulled the trigges it came off the gun. Pice of junk!
1,Terrible,"I normally try to be optomistic with my reviews, but this gun is what you pay for. a few bux. it's cheap plastic, dangerous (i'll tell why in a second), and has a very touchy trigger. so the dangerous thing is that it will sometimes shoot before you pull the trigger! this has happened multiple times, i accidently shot my foot once. so if you're looking for a cheap, crappy gun, then this is it."
1,this gun sucks!,We bought the pistol 1 week ago. The trigger broke on it within the 2 hours of me using it. I bought another one thinking it was just the spring in it. The other one broke in 1 hour of me using it. even less than the first one. do not waste your money on this gun!!
1,sucks,i bought i like 5 days ago and it broke all ready and it is too big and it is all plastic then it doest hurt when you get shot with it
3,good but not great,ok i just got the m1911 and i like it so far. rigth out of the box it is proforming really well i am happy with tht. it is a though placist i no tht cuz i dropped it like 100 time all ready. but there is on bad side to this gun the clip slides out smoothly wut it take a couple try to get it back in not gud in an airsoft war so gud gun to havs as a side arm. HAV FUN
1,Piece of crap,"Fell apart during first magizine i was not abusing it I have had many airsoft guns in the past. I wanted to get a cheap good gun but that is not what I received. I got a plasic and glue piece of crap. I would give it negitive stars. I would pay somone to take it from me. this is the worst airsoft gun i have ever had. DO NOT BUY. Unless you like crap. I would rather have bought a rock because I would have known what I was getting. I thought I was getting a good airsoft gun, but instead I got a pile of crap. DO NOT BUY EVEN FOR 1c. I know I wouldnt..."
1,"Horrible, SUCKS!!!!",This product i rate a zero please do not buy from this guy you gun will break cause i received it and the gun broke 1 minute after... if you don't want to end up like me don't buy from this guy!
1,hobbytron.com will rip you off!,Hobbytron is a rip off company - please look them up via the California BBB to see the F -rating given to them for their shady practices!Buyer Beware!
3,Good Price,Everything is as expected and for a good price.Some of the discs that I recieved seem to have very small sticky dots near the center on the readable side. My PS2 reads them just fine but my computer's optical drive could not read those discs until they were thoroughly cleaned.
3,Love the smell...but,"the great aroma does not last. It works ok to keep my silverware from going down into the disposal, but that's all."
5,Wonderful,A wonderful book that helped my son get through the tough times of going to pre-school and being away from Mom. It helped him to know that I was always with him.
5,Adorable book!,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my three girls. I can't wait to read it to them! It honestly brought tears to my eyes as I read it the first time.
5,Great for toddler starting preschool/daycare,"My 2 1/2 year old started attending daycare about a month ago, and our goodbye in the morning was so very unpleasant. I bought this book to help her adjust and accept the idea that I still love her even when we are apart, and after just one week, I can already see the difference. We had three great mornings in a row! This book is incredibly sweet, and definitely conveys the young raccoon's trepidation about doing something new and scary. Momma Raccoon is very reassuring with her lesson about the Kissing Hand, and I would recommend this book for anybody who has a young child that is unsure about something new and scary."
5,excellent book,I recommend this book to all moms with children that will start going school. My daughter age 3 absolutely loved it.
4,Average,"This is a good book if your child is nervous about school. Mine is not so he really wasn't into it. He did think it was interesting that the animal was nocturnal and went to school at night. It is my understanding that lots of schools read this to the younger students the first day of class. My nephew was in kindergarten last year and my sister is a first grade teacher and both classes did read this, so if your school does this it might be a good idea to read it to your child as something familiar that first day of class."
5,Great to read before the first day of school,"A must have for children beginning school. For the past two years, (I think), I have read this book on the first day of Kindergarten to my students and their parents in the morning just as school is about to begin. It seems to have created a much calmer atmosphere for my students and their parents. I often see the kids hold their hands to their face during the day and I know they are missing home but have a link to their family."
5,The Greatest!,My 5yr. got to take home a raccon (stuffed)named Robbie last year for a project at school. Well with it he got to take this book home to read and then tell the class about his day with Robbie. Well I fell in love with this book! It is awsome. My son is always like oh thats for girls when something is mushy like this book but he loved it. Now we have just purchased the second one Pocket full of Kisses. Great as well. Especially if there is a younger brother or sister in the family and the older child is having a hard time coping. These are definitly must own kind of books.
5,Sweetest first day of school story,"I was interning at a preschool center and myself and several other students were looking for books to read during story time. I read this story and cried my eyes out. Its an adorable story about a mother comforting her child before his first day of school. Maybe I'm a big baby, but i loved this story."
1,Made my 4 year old daughter very upset,"I do not recommend this book for toddlers! The pictures are dark and dreary and the audio is very gloomy. The little raccoon is sad and scared to leave his mother and go off to school. And it takes place at night, so the raccoon has to leave his mother and walk into the woods at night without her. My daughter was very upset at the end."
3,Meh,"It's not a bad book, it's just not that interesting to me. And while the kissing hand concept is definitely useful for any child worrying about leaving their parents for the day, I thought it was presented in an excessively sentimental way. I always find too much sentimentality just encourages children to dwell on how upset they are, rather than comforting them.But if it works for your kid, great."
5,Grreat Book,"As a kindergarten teacher, I use this book every year on the first day of school. With Audrey Penn you can't go wrong! She does a great job of putting children's fears at rest for that big step of starting school. It's a fabulous book."
5,Too bad there is not a 5 1/2 stars,Terrific book!!! Helps toddlers deal with seperation anxiety and being apart from a parent. A must have!
4,Cute but pricey,"What a cute story! My child was read this book at school and I decided that we should add it to our library. I purchased it for our Kindle Fire, and was surprised that it was more expensive than the ""hard copy"" that I found a few days later. I wish that the translation on the Kindle would have been better- it is though the pages were simply scanned from the book, with no modifications for the electronic copy."
5,Perfect story for when your child is about to start school,"Short, sweet, and too the point. This is a story about a little raccoon about to start school. He talks about his fears to his mother, fears that most children have before starting school. Then his mother comes up with a wonderful solution to help her little raccoon remember that his mommy loves him and is thinking about him, even though she isn't with him. A heart-warming story, but be warned -- it might make you tear up the first time you read it."
2,Not effective as an ebook,"This story is a sweet, simple story - my kindergartner loves it, so I bought it for him. The problem isn't with the story itself, it's with the format. This story was obviously rushed into ebook production, and it wasn't done well. The story and pictures don't match up. The text changes size and is grainy in parts, clear in others. I wish the publishers would've invested more time into changing the format of this nice story - scanning the pages into pdf format just doesn't work. Picture books as ebooks can be a lovely thing. This one simply doesn't work as it currently stands."
5,tear jerker,My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this to the kids and the parents the first day of school for orientation. I can tell you not a dry eye with the bunch of us parents! It was so touching that evening as well when my daughter asked me to kiss her hand so she could take it to school with her the first day. This will be an heirloom book for my other child as well as my grandchildren
5,outstanding book,"This is a great story for children. My son especially loves how the baby racoon gives his Mom a ""kissing hand"" at the end of the story. Especially good if your child has issues about being without you for short periods of time (Kindergarden, etc.)."
3,Not good for kids who love going to school,"The illustrations are beautiful; however, we have changed how we read the book. When we initially read the book, it was as if we were creating new fears for our twin boys (2 yrs old) to go to school. They experienced very little anxieties and we certainly didn't want to foster any! The book talks about how scaredChester is to go to school and that his mother's kiss would be with him all day long. We just began the book with how excited Chester was instead of scared he was."
5,The kissing hand,Love this book. Great way to send my babies off to kindergarten. It's a tradition in our home sometimes we have to re-read just for a little reminder.
2,Why are the pictures so small???,Purchased this book for my fire hd. Every page has tiny little tired that do not adjust or stretch. Why have a kids book with tiny pictures???
5,lightweight Comfort,"If you like Skechers, you MUST have these. So light weight but work well with jeans and a tee or jeans, button down and a blazer!"
3,Other Wolo products have let me down in the past,"I have high hopes that these will continue to work longer than other Wolo products I've used in the past. They have a clean look on my Intruder and provide a lot better horn than the factory installed horn. Mounting took a bit of time and creativity without a natural place to put them, we ended up placing them on the left side mounted to the front of the frame but had to fabricate our own bracket."
1,The Wolo Model 415-MC.,"When I recieved this Air-Horn set I expected there to be hoses, and supporting hardware for mounting on my Motorcycle....Which there WAS NOT. Now I've got to scrounge around and get the hardware for the air horns. So my Rating is ""VERY LOW"" until some sort of compensation can be made by the company or the shippers....It's that simple."
4,"Plato, bloom and Benardete","What you get here is 1) a new translation of Symposium by Benardete 2) Allan Bloom's Ladder of Love, which was previously published in his book Love and Friendship 3) a short, though not unworthy article by Benardete. Bloom dominates, so if you already have Love and Friendship and a copy of Symposium you might feel gyped because the only new thing is Benardete's small article. If however you don't have Love and Friendship and don't really care for Rousseau or the nineteen century novel, this book is a definite option. Bloom's book is rather unwieldly and unfocused. This book is most certainly focused."
1,bad rating on amazon site,I purchased this for school and on the amazon site it was listed as in good condition. It was so worn it looked horrible and the amount of highlighting made reading it distracting. If you can rate a book in this condition as good then what about products that are listed. I don't think I'll ever buy on amazon.com again.
5,Great video!!!!!,My kids ages 10 and 6 LOVE this video--especially my six yr old son. We borrowed this from our local library months ago and my son recites the Teeny-tiny and the Witch Woman story all the time. I finally decided to order our own copy and he is thrilled! It is the sweetest video. Very good story telling. I highly recommend this great video for your family.
1,Not for little kids,"My brother and I watched this movie when we were children, at a friend's house. He had nightmares for over a year about witches. It is a very creepy movie for little kids, and I bought it again recently to see what it was like now, and I couldn't believe it was for kids, or that we were ever allowed to watch it. I am not surprised my brother had nightmares."
4,Sammy's Science House,"I have not spent time yet with my grandson, now 4 years old, when he's played with his science educational toy....he is wholly into science and learning, so my guess is that he is enjoying the toy he received for the 4th birthday..."
1,It Won't Do That,"I bought the adapter because I want to use my shop vac with my new Delta table saw which has a 4"" dust collection port. It won't do that--it is the same diameter on the big end as the dust port on my Delta (or any other piece of equipment). I had expected that it would fit INTO the dust collection port and then I could hook up my shop vac. It won't do that, so I am still looking for one that will. If you are connecting hose to hose it should be fine, but I gave it the 1 star so you would notice the issue I raised."
2,It is what it is.,"After purchasing the adapter, I found that it does not fit on the dust shield of my Jet Table Saw without a piece of 4"" hose between the adapter and shield. After installing the hose, the adapter works fine."
1,Use Jet JW1000 for hose to Shop-Vac connection,"There's nothing wrong with this part if it's what you need, but I rated it one star just to point out the following: As other reviewers mention, this JW1044 is hose-to-hose only. You get better dust collection if you don't have to run through another 10' of hose just to hook things together, and Jet does make a 4"" to 2 1/4"" reducer part # JW1000. How can we get Amazon to stock it???"
3,Good as a connector for vacuum hose,This adapter works great for what it is designed for. It is only for changing 4 inch hose to 2 1/2 hose. Not designed to connect directly to a tool or shop vacuums. Usually the 2 1/2 inch hose will connect to the tool.
1,Item is not as shown in the pictures,The picture seems to show an adapter with a tapered transition from the large to the small dimension. In fact they have a 90 degree step making them not suitable if you are using a shop vac on the small end to exhaust a tool with a large diameter output. If you want to connect a smaller vac hose to a large dimension shop system they would be OK. I just threw them away.
1,Watch what you order,I ordered the Jet band saw - since this was listed as the reducer that went with this band saw - I ordered it - it was only a couple of dollars - so no big deal - but it doesn't even come close to being the one for the band saw.
1,Not for connecting shop vacs,"I purchased this with a dust collection hood for my planer. The hood has a 4"" port. I thought that I could plug my shop vac hose into this adapter and then plug the adapter into the hood. My mistake! This will allow you to adapt a 4"" hose to a 2.5"" hose, but I had to tape the adapter to the hood as both ends of the adapter are female."
2,It does not fit unless,You need a a piece of hose between the adapter and jointer since they both have the same OD. It is kind of anoying. It should have come with a piece of hose as well.
1,Had to adapt,"I thought this would work to go from 4"" female underneath table saw to 2.5"" male shop vac hose. I ended up adapting a PVC reducer with several turns of duct tape to make up the gap. There has to be something out there, but this manufacturer did not seem to make it."
2,Size is important,"The 4"" side fits my 4"" quick release well enough. The 2 1/2"" side fits the END of a 2 1/2"" hose. This does not work well if you intend to go directly from your 2 1/2"" port on your machine to your 4"" dust collection hose. The adapter and the port will more than likely be the exact same size (two female sides).The adapter is also not shaped the same as in the picture. It is not funnel shaped but a 2 1/2"" tube and a 4"" tube connected by a flat piece."
3,Not as pictured,"The adapter I received has a flat interface, not the funnel style shown. That makes a difference if using the piece with the airflow going from 4"" to 2 1/2"" due to increased turbulence.If you're planning to use this downstream from large to small diameter then I suggest you find one that is indeed funnel-shaped."
1,Incomplete and misleading product listing by Amazon!,"WATCH OUT!My Jet JW1044 4"" to 2 1/2"" adapter arrived today. Because I needed one badly I paid $6.81 for the part and $9.99 for shipping BUT I needed an adapter that was 4"" INSIDE diameter on the large end and 2 1/2"" inside diameter (nominal) on the small end.The item I received, marked ""JW1044"", is 4"" OUTSIDE diameter on the large end.THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THE TRUE, USEFUL, SIZES OF THE ENDS OF THIS ADAPTER IN THE AMAZON LISTING!WATCH OUT!"
1,take advantage?,"When buying a Grizzly 14`` bandsaw, a riser kit, a mobile platform, extra blades, and some abrasives, all shipping from different places, this simple .89 cent reducer cost over $10.00 to ship. Surely this was a mistake that will be corrected, if not , Amazon will get no more of my business and I will spread the word to the best of my ability."
3,"i ""modified"" it to work with my dust ports.","i got 2 of these, 1 for my ryobi bt3100 saw, one for a ridgid spindle/belt sander.. as others said, the 2"" end is exact diameter oftoolport,since i had 2"" pvc piping on hand, i cut a 4""length, then sawed out a 1/4"" kerf/slotlengthwise..that lets it flex enough to fit inside the toolport and this adapter,nice and TIGHT. can also use tape for a perfect Tight fit... i may also try fitting the pvc on the OUTside next,since this shrinks the I.D and decreases airflow,marginally i guess...but it fits Extra-securely now,so it's kind of a bonus !"
3,Decent reducer,"I use this almost daily when I swap the dust collector hood next to my lathe for a hose fitting to vacuum up all the chips that went elsewhere. I have a quick connect fitting on the 4"" hose to easily swap it from the hood to this reducer. This reducer is such a tight fit that I can barely get it deep enough in the mating fitting to hold. It pops out easily just on the weight of 6' of 2 1/2 in hose."
3,Works as expected,It was what I expected. I wish the transition was shaped like a funnel instead of a flat wall. But it works.
1,"Don't trust the four inch size, get exact ID and OD size","As another reviewer said..... this is the exact same size as the tool port I have.... it is NOT four inches, but slightly less. If it were exactly four inches, it would have worked.... if it were funnel shaped, it would have worked, but it's the exact same size as my dust port. it will not fit over , or inside my dust port. The industry needs a better explanation for dust port sizes.... This has caused me agravation a few other times on shop vac and other tool dust port sizes.Gene"
3,Does not include the original version of Beat Box.,"This package shipped with the Diversion One edition of Beat Box, a serious flub. I haven't listened to it much because of that. The other songs from the cassette release are present and accounted for but the included DVD is rather useless.Anyone looking for the original Beat Box should look at one of the other compilations; don't buy this one."
1,into battleand the art of noise,I bought this CD for 1 song. It sounds nothing like the song on the radio. I expected it to be a longer version of it. On line you can listen to several different great versions. I was so disappointed in this CD.
1,Stay away!!! This is even worth a red cent,You can find better versions of these songs on other records. All these sound like are bad outtakes that were thrown together to make some money for the holiday Christmas music.
1,It Didn't Sound Like Bobby Helms singing the title song!,"This version of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" is very bad. It has been slowed down so that it doesn't even sound like Bobby Helms. Very deceiving...it isn't worth the money. You can purchase other complete Christmas albums by Bobby Helms that sound Great...Don't be taken advantage of by this CD!"
4,Good consistent Hose,"This is a black 2"" hose, made of ABS plastic. The sizing is very consistent, as I cut it into 3 foot sections, each end maintained 2 inches. The hose is very rigid, almost crushproof, yet flexible enough to move from side to side and up and down and all round. It is not flexible enough, though, to move back and forth (in and out) as if you were moving machinery from the wall to a work area. But it is an excellent hose for permanent pieces of equipment for your dust collection system."
3,"Cheap, May Be OK","I got this hose to relocate a built-in house vacuum. The only other ribbed 2"" hose I could find was about $10 per foot, so this seemed like a steal. I moved the vacuum and ran the hose to it using zip ties to hang the hose from the wall. Looked good until I turned on the vacuum. When the vacuum is on, the hose is so flexible that any unsupported section collapses like an accordion. Kind of funny to watch, but I'm not sure how long it'll last..."
3,A Bit long on the Truth,"If you love the Temptations,you'll like The Undisputed Truth.Norman Whitfield,was Songwriter and producer for both groupsat the same time. The led to a lot of crossover meterial fromthe Tempts to the Truth. Hence you have ""What it is"" that gavewords to ""Hum along and Dance"" a Temps instrumental.Norman Whitfield described ""The Undisputed truth as a crossbetween Sly Stone and The 5TH Demension on my copy of the original LP(on which I base the review) They weren't as funkyas Sly nor as pleasent to the ears as the 5th.But the carved their own niche on EVERY song they did,whether you liked it or not you never forgot their version.So hear The Undisputed TRUTH for yourself and decideIf you can handle the Truth."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!!!,"I bought this DVD player at Best Buy and it worked for a grand total of about 2 weeks. The picture quality and sound WERE great for a time, but now it wont play anything. I put in a DVD and the screen just stays black. I checked the manual for troubleshooting and found no answers, so i called our ""friends"" at the Mintek technical support center, and they did nothing to help. If you're looking for 2 weeks of cheap fun, buy this, but if you would like something that lasts, i suggest you look elsewhere."
1,this thing really is not worth your money!,i bought this and the instant i took it out of the box i was appauled! the screen was split down the middle. the video didnt work and there was no sound. the battery stayed charged for about 6 minutes after charging it for 6 hours. don't buy this!
1,How Frustrating,"I took this on a trip and much to my horror, it worked for about 20 minutes and then frooze up again and again and again! I got it to work again for about another 20 minutes and then that was it. If I could have opened the window of the plane, I would have thrown it out. Check out the Initial ones. They seem to be better quality at a value price."
1,"Worthless junk, bad service. Ripped off!","After two months of moderate, gentle use, the picture tube died. It went completely black. Sent it to Mintek. After six weeks, they sent me a new one.Within three weeks, the picture started to freeze on the NEW one. Then, the picture tube ALSO went black. Mind you, neither unit had been dropped, left in the sun, and were fully charged or running on house current. Sent this one to Mintek, too. Haven't heard from them in two months."
2,when it works...,"When it worked, it worked great. The picture quality was good, the sound was what I'd expect from a compact system like this. However, after having the unit only 6 days (I got it as a Christmas gift) it stopped working... kind of. It worked for one DVD, then the next one it would stick on ""loading"". On the third DVD I tried, it got me to the main menu screen, but then it didn't let me choose anything to watch and then recycled and gave me the blue ""loading"" screen again. I tried a fourth DVD, it worked just fine. All of the DVDs I tried were brand new (or watched once) without scratches or defects.If you asked me, the defect is in the product. I for one, am unimpressed. If you don't mind dropping $200 for a sometimes working DVD player / doorstop, go for it.And before anyone asks, I'm an adult (over 30) and I was the only one using this at home on my kitchen counter mostly. No jostling car ride, no kids breaking it. It didn't need that - it broke on its own."
1,"Poor machine, poor customer service",I received a MDP-5861 for Christmas and boy was I disappointed. I have yet to be able to play a DVD from start to finish without the movie freezing. I have to power off and eject the disc then power on and re-insert the disc to watch the next 10 minutes before it freezes. I have not been able to speak with a person at Mintek to get the warrented repairs. Mintek doesn't even answer their email. This machine is not worth spending $10 much less $200.
2,Would be good...,"This player would be a great deal, it has a good picture, decent sound, no problems except... THE DISCS GET SCRATCHED. After I had it about a month, my discs began to get scratched around the outside. The last scene or two was lost on a few of my DVDs. I had to return the player and buy another. I haven't heard of this happening to anyone else, but i assure you it can happen. If you want to take a risk then it is a good player to buy, but I would go with one of the other players now available for this cost."
2,Problems with Mintek DVD player,"I purchased this DVD player November 7, 2003 for my brother.After just several uses it started behaving erratically. After watching a movie for 20-30 minutes it freezes up. Sometimes it will start backup if you turn off the machine and wait 10 minutes. However, just this week it will not start at all. I am going to try to replace or return it. I would be wary of purchasing this item."
1,Don't buy anything from mintek,"First off, let me correct some other reviews. Mintek does have a website.(www.mintekdigital.com) HOWEVER, that's not going to help very much. For returns or problems you have to call them. I have called about a dozen times and I always get the voice mail of one of two different people. Neither of them has called me back. Evdently ONLY TWO PEOPLE WORK IN CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ALL OF NORTH AMERICA! My problem is that the power suplly burned up. Without the power supply you can't charge the battery or run the unit on A/C power. What's worse, even if I wanted to bite the bullet and just buy a new power supply I can't because the item isn't listed. Stay away from Mintek."
1,"NO STARS, DON'T BUY, DON'T BUY","IT WOULD BE A NICE UNIT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT IT WONT PLAY. A BRAND NEW DVD THAT I ORDERED WITH IT GAVE THE ""NO DISK ERROR"". AND RENTAL DISKS SHUT DOWN AND REFUSED TO PLAY AGAIN....BAD, BAD, BADGET A BRAND WE'VE ALL HEARD OF LIKE SONY OR TOSHIBA....ITS JUST NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE.....GAME OVER\ :("
1,mintek dvd player,"i just received this item last week, and all i want to say is it is not a very good system at all. every time i am watching a movie it freezes up on me after 10-15 minutes."
1,ZERO STARS! Replaced 3 Times!,"This DVD player is the pitts! I have replaced it on 3 different occasions and it breaks with in 30-45 days. I will not replace it again. Before it broke it would load S-L-O-W...save youself the hassle pay 50.00 more and avoid the frustration, Unless you prefer frustration then by all means Buy Mintek!"
1,Flawed product,"We have bought and returned two of these in the past month. First let me say the sound and the picture are great. We were disappointed when it began freezing up and was unable to load discs. We returned it and bought another, thinking maybe ours was just a lemon. Within 1 hour of use, we had the same problem. Would be a fantastic product if it was not for this, but buyer beware. Not worth the hassle."
2,Present failed in just 10 days,"I received this as a gift and thought it was wonderful, great picture, great sound and then nothing. The player failed to work in just 10 short days. Purchased on 12/10 and returned on 12/22.Despite following the instructions for trouble shooting the player just sat on ""loading"". The purchase price was $269.00, for the price I think it should last longer than 10 days. This product seems to fragile for use."
1,Output to television too dark (0 IRE instead of 7.5 IRE),"In addition to everything else, it's bad for playing DVDs out to a television. The video that it outputs is too dark. I was puzzled so I tested it on a professional video monitor. Instead of outputting a video signal with the ""black level setup"" value at 7.5 IRE (the standard for American NTSC televisions), the Mintek is outputting a signal at 0 IRE (the NTSC-Japan and PAL standard). This is not changeable. What a pain. If you were ever thinking of hooking this up to an American television, think again. Yes, I know that some DVD players pretend it's a picture-enhancing feature to allow 0/7.5 IRE switching (some manufacturers call it ""black level expansion""), but really that switching is just to allow better compatibility with different TV systems. This model flunks."
1,junk,I bought this dvd player yesterday and it didn't even work at all. Every time I put a disk in it would say loading and then give me an error message that the disk was the wrong region. This one is definately going back and I'm getting a refund from best buy today.
2,UNHAPPY 6 YEAR OLD,SANTA BROUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER ACTUALLY IT WAS THE 7 INCH SHE WATCHED ONE MOVIE ON IT AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL. WELL TO OUR SURPRISE THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME IT WOULD WORK! SHE STARTED TO WATCH A SECOND MOVIE AND IT LOCKED UP SEVERAL TIMES SO WE TRIED ANOTHER MOVIE SAME THING. THE NEXT DAY OUR FIRST CAR TRIP WITH THIS AND SHE WAS SO EXCITED BUT THIS TIME THE PICTURE WENT OUT BUT WE COULD HEAR IT. TROUBLE SHOOTING DID NOTHING!THIS WAS $250.00! HOW DISAPPOINTING FOR MY DAUGHTER!
1,Junk - failed after 3 DVDs.,"Believe all these bad reviews. This is junk. Failed after 3rd DVD. Player returned. Will not buy Mintek again. The problem I think is the DVD laser transport gets stuck and fails to move, faulty mechanism."
1,Screen died <1 year in,"Like a number of other reviewers before me, this unit has a problem with the backlight dying. There is still a picture, but on an LCD with no backlight you can't tell. I won't even comment on other features, since if there is no picture after less than 1 year, who cares? Very disappointing. This thing came in handy during long car trips, and we're flying this weekend with multiple connections. Now my 4 year old is going to be bouncing off the walls for 5 hours. Thanks, Mintek."
1,My screen died too!,"We received this as a gift for my 2 and 4 year old children. We loved this item until the screen died! We have had this less than a year, and haven't used it that much. We turned it on one day and had no picture. Iy was very dark, only faint images remain. Steer clear of this brand. After reading similar reviews, it seems this is pretty common with this product."
2,POOF! Mintek DVD Player BROKEN after only 6 MONTHS,"Well...count me among the fools who bought this. It worked fine for six months, and then POOF! Broken. My daughter was watching a DVD in the car and suddenly the picture disappeared. The sound still works, but the only picture is a dark, faint, black shadow. Of course, I have tried to call customer support for an entire afternoon and only get an answering machine. How's that for customer satisfaction!? Wouldn't you expect, for $179, that you'd receive a product that lasts more than half a year? My advice: Steer clear of this one."
3,"For me, this is Lord of The Rings parody","Or maybe I should say Conan parody? Or Narnia parody? Or cry of despair because million writers are publishing their epic fantasy novels as seven tome 600 pages books and there is no stop?This one let me down because I expected a story to be no nonsense just like Smax is non nonsense character, but if I had approached it more open minded I would have liked it better I guess..."
5,Alan Moore doing Terry Pratchett...more or less.,"I was never that much of a fan of the original Top Ten series. But I really enjoyed this fun and engaging spin off. In this series we follow Top Ten character Smax back to the ""Sword and Sorcery"" style parallel universe where he grew up. This book is fairly different from Top Ten - this is pretty much Alan Moore doing humorous fantasy in the style of Terry Pratchett's ""Discworld"" novels - although Moore can be a little bit more dark and nasty than Pratchett. Readers who haven't read Top Ten should be able to pick this one up and enjoy it, although they may be slightly confused the first five or ten pages. But after that this is completely its own story. And it's all very enjoyable."
3,"Pretty good, not great","I have to say I liked Smax, but it wasn't great. I mean it was funny, had nice atmosphere and setting and overall everything was decent, but... Well, the plot seemed a little thin for all the build up. There's this whole big secret problem Smax has and then, well they walk around for a couple pages find the dragon, Robin thinks up a gimmick, and there you go. And the fact that the whole Smax and sister thing is solved so quickly, well. I guess I expected more from the fact that this was a mini-series and all. I'd say it's about as good as one of the side-stories in Top Ten, but not as good as the main plot arc in those books."
5,HE'S THE GREATEST,"ELEPHANT MAN IS ONE OF MY BEST RAGGEA ARTIST.HE'S REAL AND I HOPE EVERYONE OUT THERE THINKS THE SAME WAY I DO, AND WE ALL SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD BUT NOT ""BURN"" OFF ALL THE MUSIC WE WANT"
1,false advertisment,The company false advertised this product so I was stuck with a cereal bowl that says popcorn and the company refused to do anything but charge me shipping to send it back which makes me still pay $20 for something I don't have instead of a piece of crap.
4,Excellent overview,"Serge Lang's Basic Mathematics is an excellent overview of algebra and geometry. If you are in high school needing a tutorial primer, or an adult continuing their education after some years, this book will provide through its clarity, examples, and exercises (selected answers are in the back of the book)the refresher course you need for more advanced mathematics, such as calculus and linear algebra."
3,A thorough look,"This book gives an account of the politics and behind the scene workings between Great Britain and Germany pre-WWII. The book begins with the Munich Agreement to the beginning of the invasion of Poland. This is a well researched and detailed account of this period. Prospective readers I'm sure will enjoy the conversation between the diplomats and Heads of State. I recommend this book, but for me it wasn't an interesting read. I prefer William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich over this book."
5,I was constantly telling my wife about things in the story!!,"Susan Meissner doesn't treat her characters nice. She throws everything imaginable at them! I was consistently amazed how she dug deep to find all the hurts, doubts, and uncertainties that would come from this painful situation. And I loved her writing style. Wonderful read!"
4,Deep Blue,"Painfully and beautifully real.We all carry around parts and pieces of each other. Our stuff bumps together and our reasons, our justifications, and our have-tos leak into the lives of everyone we touch.A brutal reality and two very different views of choices color the lives of five women. The haunting memories, misunderstandings and sorrows make this a heavy read, but one that leaves you with a sense of hope, restoration and healing.Meissner writes with soul and heart, and she invites her readers to take a piece of her with them."
2,Fragile Construction,"The plastic ""frame"" that holds the deck is very thin. When I received the item in the mail, it wasn't exactly shipped in the most durable package. However, there weren't any visible signs of damage. When I took the dash kit and my radio to the installation place, the tech informed me that one of the sides had cracked. There were signs of stress all along the inside of the plastic housing. I'm aware that this could have happened in shipping, regardless though the construction seemed very flimsy."
5,SUMCO barber razor,"This is German high quality original barber razor . I have purchased similar items from Amazon which were from China and were of very poor quality. Could not even sharpen them to shave. This item is little bit pricey, but it's worth it. Do not buy items such as this one from China. They may be cheaper ,but they cannot be used for intended purpose, which is shaving."
2,Can't cut myself intentionally,"This product was made sturdy. However it's really dull. In fact it's so dull that I couldn't intentionally cut myself. I tried shaving with this 2 separate times for an hour each to no avail. I ended up running out and getting some disposable blades for the interim.Mind you this is the first time I've tried shaving with a straight razor, but I stayed at it trying different angles and such for quite sometime. I'm sending mine back."
2,Shaved off nothing but my skin.,"I've tried everything on this razor. I bought a water sharpening stone to hone it, and I have a strop. However, no matter how much I sharpen it or hone it, it remains dull. I go over my face over and over again, and very little hair is removed. I do manage to cut my self 22 times, but little hair is removed. If you want to shave with a straight razor you should either buy a DOVO or buy a vintage one from the 30's made by a good american company such as:1.) Waterville2.) Genco3.) Geneva4.) Case (W.R. Case & Sons)5.) Winchester6.) Sta-Sharp7.) Craftsman (There is also a German version that is superlative)You can find these razors in fine shape on ebay for under $20"
1,Dull Blade Makes for Painful shave,"The product is inexpensive but has a dull edge, did not cut my whiskers well and did not sharpen well either.I decided to abandon it completely and buy a more expensive straight razor."
2,DULL. Hope this thing can be sharpened.,You CAN NOT shave with this razor on delivery. Maybe if you have facial hair like I did in the 6th grade. If you have facial hair that's even slightly course ( like most men's are ) this is not going to cut it. After the first few painful strokes that felt as if it was pulling the hair out instead of shaving it off I decided to strop it. 150 strop strokes later ( properly done with the edge trailing I might add ) it improved a bit but still wouldn't take the hair off properly. Pulled out my old trusty Mach 3 and finished shaving. Came honed from the factory but I guess I will try honing it myself and stropping. If I don't get anywhere with it after that to the garbage it goes and a well known more expensive blade will be purchased.
3,Consumer Grade,"It's consumer grade crap, but, then again, it is cheap, so I definitely got what I paid for. If you want a straight razor that's going to last, you're going to have to pay for it."
3,Worthwhile for Musical Content,"This is a very interesting CD. I am a big fan of the Wilder Sonata (which is why i bought the CD), but after listening to all the songs, I've grown to really like the entire cd. The pieces all show heavy jazz influence. The clarinetist is technically good, but his tone lacks a little focus at times (it's not a big deal, just occasionally distracting). The pianist is exceptional! Despite the few problems, this CD is worth a look, especially is you like jazz."
2,What's the application?,"The steel band clamp should only be used in one type of application. That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, DO NOT use the steel band clamp, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to secure the wire rib. The steel banding is not designed to do that task. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the twenty cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 50% of the applications with the steel band clamps. I antied up and spent the extra cash and got the right product, the wire clamps for the ribbed DC hose."
1,Don't use them,Don't waste your time with these. I returned 60 of these clamps after using 12 and found them to strip the thread very easily. Buy the wire clamps.
3,Importance of scale,"Amazon Product Specifications lists this as an LED-based light. It is not. It uses a standard C7 light bulb.The motion sensor works fine, and the light output is higher than a typical night light. However, this thing is huge!! It's as long as my hand. I use it in my garage, where the regular light switch is too far away from the door, and I wanted some light to keep me from tripping down the steps before I can reach the lights. Since aesthetics aren't important in the garage, the motion sensor and extra light output are a welcome trade-off for the big size."
3,Works most of the time,"Purchased for a bathroom; seems to come on when the overhead light is on sometimes (maybe it's catching a shadow?) and other times when it's pitch black I literally have to cup my hand over the sensor to get it to come on. Most of the time it does work, although the range of motion isn't as good as I'd hoped."
4,Lights night AND day,"The motion sensor works very well, and makes this night light very convenient. The amount of light output is just right, and I like the warm incandescent better than LED night lights. However, the ambient light sensor threshold is set so that the night light comes on even when the room light is quite bright. So, the light is operating pretty much night AND day."
4,great light output,"This was really a great product, will update if any future issues, east to set up and super light for my long hall way. I had a different battery powered light before this one and got tired of recharging batteries every month. This is really a nice light, replaceable bulb and nice quality product."
5,MOTION SENSOR NITE LITE,"I've ordered these before from Amazon. They are a great light and quite sensitive to motion. I will continue to purchase more, as needed and highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants a light that will go on as soon as you step out of bed, round a corner in a hallway or enter a bathroom in the dark."
3,Holy cow this light is huge!,"I could not believe how big this night light was when it arrived. And the description claims ""Unique design leaves second outlet unobstructed."" WRONG! I can not plug anything into the bottom outlet with this huge light plugged in above. I was going to put it in our guest bathroom but I am too embarrassed by it, so it is currently in our master bathroom. If you don't want a Jedi light saber sicking out of your wall then I recommend shopping around for a smaller (and cheaper) motion activated night light."
4,Great for motion sensing!,"We bought three of these night lights. On the first night one of them acted only sporadically but this was fixed by simply tightening the bulb in the unit. My only complaint is that they do not turn off when you turn a light on. This seems a little wasteful and like an easy fix, but other than that we like them!"
1,Spoiled by 5000K (white) light temp,"This light color is definitely yellow, very low end of visible light spectrum. If you don't mind that, go for it. I do, since I like my lights, house and car headlights for example, white, e.g. 5000-5100K. Most people probably don't care, considering all the 5 star reviews here."
3,Update see below!!! ...UPDATE!!!,"I have purchased 6 more of these lights since I first wrote the first review and MANY of the lights do quit working - it's not the bulb. Buy with caution -- it seems about 50% are great and will last for years with replacement bulbs, and the others will quit with no reason -- one didn't work when I took it out of the box new!!!! Yikes. Try another brand.We found loose wires on some of the units and wereable to get several years use with replacing the bulbs.I wish I hadn't thrown the others away before openingthem up to check the wires... Live and learn"
1,SO DISAPPOINTED...Save Your Money!,"Ok,.....well, these were GREAT for two months. I bought three of them and that was in December...now it is only February and TWO of them have stopped working. SAVE YOUR MONEY! Don't buy them....I'm SO disappointed. And, I keep waiting for the one that is still working to die (it shouldn't be long now). What a rip off!"
4,this one works,"the sensor works great, it lights up a good size area.because of the elongated shape it would not plug intomy garage outlet which has a cover that folds back."
1,Broke in less than 2 months,"Updated review: This product broke after less than two months. Even with a new bulb, it won't work. I'd recommend selecting a different brand. What a waste of money. :(Initial review (5 stars, if it hadn't have broken): We bought this night-light for our 6-week old daughter's room, so we could keep it dark at night but have light for feeding and changing her. We've been very impressed! The 90-second time is great -- I can do a diaper change with two swipes of the foot. The sensor works wonderfully, and we have it plugged into a power surge so we can point the sensor and light in the direction away from the baby. It's not great at figuring out when it's daytime -- it sometimes comes on during the day -- but this doesn't bother me and I'll just unplug it if needed. You'll love it!"
1,doesn't work,"Unit came in opened package, tried it in several locations, red light indicates it is getting power. Checked light bulb. Never has turned on.Cost to send pack probably exceeds cost of product not counting the hassle.Do not buy this product"
5,Good product,It illuminates very well. A little large- but it works for the areas I have them in. Ordered one- liked it enough to order a second. I have one in the bathroom and it is bright enough that I do not have to turn on the overhead light at night. Remains on for just the right amount of time. I would buy again.
5,Motion night light,"The motion night light is perfect, does exactly what it is supposed to do, after no motion for 30 sec the light goes off. You can even change the bulb to a 7 watt from a 4 watt that it comes with or put a color bulb in other then white, like Christmas colors, white clear 7 watt is the best. i purchased 3 of them."
5,Perfect for Garage,We actually put two of these in our two car garage. The sensors work great and they provide enough light for when we enter and exit the garage
2,Blah,"It came on time which was the only thing good here, but the back pack was way smaller than I expected and the doll here self looks like she has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with a touch of Downs. But for $10, what do you expect?"
1,this is NO backpack!,"Please don't buy this item if you are looking to actually put something into this toy. On the back is a zippered slot and I swear to you, all you can put in there is a solitary quarter. It was sort of a gag gift for my grown daughter because I wanted to give her a check, and I literally had to fold the check SIX TIMES to get it to fit into the back. It's a sweet looking doll, but that is all that it is....a doll. Just be warned so that you know what you are purchasing. I had no problem with my transaction and would buy from the seller again, just not this item."
3,Anthony plays a psycho again,"After burning down his house, Anthony Perkins spends some time in a mental instiution. (Deja vu? This same scenario was used in his 1968 movie Pretty Poison.) His sister Julie Harris takes him in reluctantly. Her father died in the fire and the two had an unusual relationship. Pretty soon Anthony is starting to go mad again. Or is someone just playing with him? For a tv movie this is pretty good. Anthony Perkins and Julie Harris both give nice laid back performances. Running time says 90 but actually it's 70 minutes. 2.5 rounded to 3"
3,paint chips off,The paint on the handles doesn't hold up in the washer. It chips off easily and soon after I got the knives.
4,Early Higgins' Book shows author's developing talent,"Between 1963 and 1964, Harry Patterson, aka Jack Higgins wrote 8 books. This was one of the authors most prolific periods of writing, as well as one of his most interesting. He wrote crime novels, a western (Thunder at Noon), a romance (A Phoenix in the Blood), World War II novels (Seven Pillars to Hell, later published as Sheba) and Pay the Devil, a book which is set in 1865 and follows the exploits of Confederate Colonel Clay Fitzegerald. The Colonel has just ended on the losing side of the Civil War and returns to Ireland for peace and quite. He instead gets caught up in the 'troubles.' Like most of Higgins' early novels, this book is an entertaining, fast-paced story full of one-dimensional characters. If you want a fun and quick read for the holidays, this book is it. Although, if you want better Higgins' try Valhalla Exchange, Touch The Devil, A Prayer for the Dying, Thunderpoint or The Eagle has Landed."
1,Far from his best work.,"I've read a number of Higgin's works -- On Dangerous Grounds, Drink With the Devil, The Eagle Has Landed and A Season In Hell to name a few. This short novel however, did not share the depth and intrigue that I found in his other efforts. The boy meets girl; boy gets girl plot was shallow and the storyline had an ending that was predictable after the first three chapters. Needless to say, I was disappointed in this most recent effort. It was almost like the author was behind in a deadline to get a book out and this was it. I can say however, that I do have a better understanding of the origins of the Protestant/Catholic conflict in Northern Ireland."
1,disappointing,I could not believe Jack Higgins actually wrote this insipid book. I kept looking at the cover to verify the author. I am glad to find out this was first written in 1963 therefore should not be an indication of author's current abilities. The plot was shallow. Boy meets girl..everything works out rosy. Seemed more like a cheesy romance novel. I have read numerous Jack Higgins works and loved them all.......until this one. Take my advice and skip it.
1,Great for a 15 year old,"I was very disappointed in this book, as the story seemed stolen from a Disney movie (""Zorro"" or ""Scarecrow""). It was rushed at best and made no attempt to explore the history of the English occupation of Ireland. Nor did it deal at all with the Finnians in North America (their attempt to invade and capture Canada, and negotiate with England for its exchange for Ireland). I only noted one interesting fact, and that was that an acre of land planted with potatoes can feed many more people than if planted with wheat. If a potential reader is a fan of Sean Dillon, he/she may better spend their time elsewhere."
2,The Original Romance Paperback,"I was very disappointed in this book -- unlike most of the Higgins' novels, it read like a cheesy romance paperback. The hero arrives in rural Ireland, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and becomes a Zorro-like secret hero. Really, now, how gullible do you think we are? No one puts two and two together, when Clay's (famous blood line) horse is part of the action?"
3,Quite a departure from the usual Higgins,"This is a Harry Patterson novel of 1962, revised and reissued. It's quite a departure from the usual Higgins. Set at the end of the American Civil War. Surgeon-soldier Confederate Colonel Clay Fitzgerald ends the war in disillusionment and heads for Ireland to claim his inheritance and find a bit of peace and quiet. He's accompanied by his manservant Joshua.Soon Clay realises that he isn't going to get any peace and quiet after all. He encounters inhumane treatment of the locals by the landed gentry. When he meets Joanna, who is against the establishment, particularly her uncle, Clay is smitten. He joins in the cause to fight the injustices heaped upon the villagers.This would make a good TV movie. Plenty of action, clear-cut characters, and a nod to history. It's the kind of material for a film Mel Gibson might have made in his English-bashing days. The English-bashing in this case seems quite justified. An interesting fast read."
3,How much?,"One of Jack Higgins' earlier novels, ""Pay the Devil"" is nevertheless an entertaining if uneven read. Unlike his later novels, ""Pay the Devil"" weaves not the same level of intrigue, but this is tempered by frequent bouts of action.The narrative involves the return of Colonel Clay Fitzgerald to Ireland following the American Civil War to inherit the house left by his Uncle. Once in Ireland, however, Clay fast becomes outraged at the unfair treatment of the tenant workers. Adopting the mantle of the legendary outlaw Captain Swing, the Colonel sets out to avenge the peasant workers.Unfortunately, for all its pace, the novel has its fair share of inconsistencies. Firstly, the syntax is simple and often without sufficient description. Secondly, the plot is uneven and often unsatisfactory, with the reader left without the knowledge of ""Who was the original Captain Swing?""All facets considered, While certainly an interesting diversion, ""Pay the Devil"" has too many flaws to recommend."
4,"Fast paced, easy to read",I read this book in two days. The story is very quick. Higgins introduces the main character very quickly. They are easy to identify with.This is the classic story of good v evil. Might v Right. The lowly Irish peasants against the aristocratic English gentry. Into all of this is thrown a Confederate cavalry officer with American ideals about freedom and liberty. He must choose sides.A good book if you are in a hurry. Not a lot of depth to the story or the characters. Higgins has left the ending open for a followup with some of the same characters if he so chooses.
3,His 'New' Paperback,"I have read a lot of Jack Higgins books - I am always been into them from the first paragraph. This one, however, I found very difficult to get into and nearly gave up. Most unusual, but then I found that it had been written nearly 40 years ago, under the name Harry Patterson, and never made it to a paperback. So, I suppose the publishers are in order to call it 'His NEW paperback'. Bit of a con really. Anyway, found it most enjoyable once it got going - unusual to have an Irish story without Devlin or Dillon. I was totally engrossed by the end. Set in Ireland in the 19th Century, it precedes the IRA stories in his later books. Overall, a good read, but not his best"
3,Good For a 15 year old----I resent that,"yeah okay it might be true, I AM 15, I didnt really like this book from a critical point of view, It was short and lacking of detail, it took me 2 days to read. It wasnt great, but it served its purpose as a time filler, I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read on the plane or something like that, it really is a great book, if you have a mind to not be reviewing it at the same time"
4,Higgins goes Irish with a COnfederate twist.,"Higgins is not the kind of guy one reads for deep thought. This was fun romp through the 19th century. So what if it is 40 years old, it's still fun to read!"
1,"Do not buy, there are better quality sets out there!","Shipping was prompt! I purchased this product in hopes of a good deal, I was wrong. The set came delivered with corrosion already on it sealed in its red case. The case is cheap im not even going to describe it. Then i opened it, I couldn't believe how poorly made this product is. They are not even symmetric, The casting is all crooked and uneven, crowfoot set is full of imperfections, corrosion, lopsided, looks as if they were made by hand There is no way the company uses a quality control system. I tried to look past all of that, i couldn't even get the one of the crowfoot to fully seat hardware i was torquing because the crowfoot was so crooked. I will be returning them, There is no way i will use this on a Car let alone a Aircraft. Garbage! Oh and it says right on the set, ""Made in China"". I suggest Amazon drop this product from their store."
3,"Great content, cheap book","This small paperback reprint volume of vintage Peanuts Sunday strips is essential for the Peanuts fan but such a cheap reprint format does not do justice to the strips. The panels are reproduced on cheap, pulp-like paper much smaller than the original newspaper version and with very little spine margin. The strips, of course, are printed here in black-&-white. I'd had been willing to pay ... for a large-size softcover with decent paper and the strips in color. I'd been glad to pay [more money] for the thing in hardcover. Oh, well, it's worth having like it is for the strips themselves but I can remember when a paperback book of this size and production quality sold for 50 cents at the corner drug store. I'd give it 5 stars if the physical quality of the book were in keeping with its illustrious content."
3,"Ok when new, but don't last very long","I cycled with these for approx 3 months, and now the two center rows of studs are seated so deep that the studs barely protrude at all. I have very little traction on ice. They were great when they were brand new, but I've wiped out three times already on ice because of low traction, even though I ride very carefully and not aggressively (I commute to work).So yes, they are fantastic when they are new, but they sure don't seem to last long.And yes, I have the model with tungsten carbide studs. The studs are not worn out, they are simply ""pushed in"" too deep to be effective. The studs on the sides are still fine, it's only the two center rows that are pushed in.I'm looking into getting replacement tires (bought at MEC), or re-studding the tire with Maxgrip or Nokian studs."
4,The right oil!!,"Having been given a nice Williams and Sonoma Bamboo chopping board, I set out to find the right treatment for it. Mineral oil is the usual answer but it is difficult to find in stores. I bought this oil after seeking it out on Ask.com and it is a very good product. it is light, flavor and odorless, and easily applied with great results."
1,Works Great (at attracting ants),"First off as a block oil, thuis works very well. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Smell is pleasant, protects the wood well.However the ants go crazy for this stuff. I have an ant problem as it is but whenever I oil my boards or blocks the next day andfor about a week it is covered in ants. At first i thought it was a coincidence. Now that i have used it several times the ant thingis consistent. The amazing thing is that I searched the internet and there was nothing about ants being especially attracted tolemon oil, but there must be another ingredient in there that is attracting it. Unfortunately i will be throwing out a half used bottlebecause I cannot deal with it anymore"
5,Very Satified with purchase,I have been buying music from Amazon for a long time and have been very satisfied with the products I have purchased I will continue to buy fron them . They are tops in my opinion. Alfred Vann
3,"Quaint, but Not Remarkable.","I was assigned this book for a class on Aesthetic and Decadant movements in Victorian British literature, and had never heard of it before then. However, I did enjoy it. It has a sardonic but good-natured tone that is winning, and it's not surprising that Du Maurier was greatly influenced by Thackeray; they share the same subtle sting in their prose.Unfortunately, contrasting with the entertainment value in the novel, there is little of substance, unless one wishes to dig back into the social mileau of the time, which included many anxieties expressed in this book. It is interesting in this context, but I don't know if I would have done the work on my own without the class to guide me.So, if you want some light entertainment of the Victorian variety, I definitely recommend this book to you--otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,"Great, Sturdy Lead","This is a very well made product. I like the ""ribbon"" lead over the cord. I have two ""spirited"" Scotties that need a firm hand. I bought one for each and they are perfect for strength and durability. They are much more expensive than the cord, but I think they are extremely well made and will last much longer."
4,Hefty tape flexi leash,I ordered this for my 25 pound wire fox because I didn't trust the lighter weight category. It is a hefty (read: heavy) leash to carry compared to the previous cord leash we used until it decided to stop retracting (in all fairness it was almost 4 years old and had been used at least 3-4 times a day each day). The tape is most definately an improvement in the cord. I like this brand for their quality and I am not disappointed by my purchase. I would have preferred a black/grey or silver/grey combo instead of the dentist waiting room color selections that they offer. Oh well spearmint green is what we'll be saddled with for the next four years.
4,my fave soilent.,"less blues influence then the rest of their stuff. just nasty grind here. perhaps not as mature as later material, but its mean sounding and still interesting none the less."
1,No Original Artists-Not worth it unless U/R/A Eurobeats Fan,"There should be a disclaimer here to indicate that These are not original songs. For all I knew, it was a european album (Eurobeats)."
4,"This man is the real ""CROCODILE DUNDEE"" !",It is pleasing that one can still escape to different times and different settings to the environment we city dwellers live in today. Tom Cole gives us a no nonsense insight into a remarkable life of buffalo and crocodile hunting.
2,Nothing New Here & Somewhat Annoying,"I would recommend Patrick McGiligan's biography because it has the research and detail one would expect of a biography. This book, (I assume written by an Englishman since it was published in England and uses words like ""chum"",etc) is a composite of what has already been published on Jack Nicholson. Its even balanced and focuses on seminal events in Nicholoson's life and his movies..What is very annoying about this book is the excessive description of the cultural context that surrounded Jack's 60's days...Way too much setting, frankly because there is not any new content here...If you don't know much about Jack, this is not a bad introductory piece....Oh, yes the other thing about this book is way too much (previously published) information on Warren Beatty, Roman Polanski, Marlon Brando, and Robert Evans...the writer goes into great details on the problems in their lives...not central to subject of this biography..."
3,Well,"Loved it the first couple of times that I wore it. Purchased the golden wheat and the color is great. Hair is poor quality and started matting.....horribly after just 2 wears. Price was cheap so yes, you get what you pay for"
5,Sweet Shoes,I am 6' and very skinny and wear a size 11.5 M. These shoes make my feet look like a size 9 and I like that. They are very soft and feel broke in the day you put them on. I probab;y will pay more next time for this brand.
1,Disappointment,Length:: 0:48 MinsMe reviewing the new bird toy I bought for my Jenday Conure. Hopefully you watch this and think twice before buying this item.
3,Ehhhh,"This perch bends over with 2 quaker parrots on it. There is no way it could hold a cockatoo or a macaw. Though it is fun for my quakers to tear up, I wouldn't recomment it for anything bigger than a conure."
4,nice product,"Installed quickly on my 2010 F-250, and fits nicely. The latches at the back end are not as easy to use as other latches I have experienced, but adequate non the less."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BRAND!!!,"This is definently a waste of $250. Even though the picture and sound are great, the player only plays very very few DVD's uninterrupted. It just stops in the middle of a movie and when you take the disc out and clean it, it still skips in the same spot. If you are a first time buyer and are looking for a cheap, good quality portable DVD player, DO NOT waste your money on a Mintek."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this player for a trip I was taking last summer. It worked really good until we hit a patch of road in NY that was all torn up. We travelled across 100 miles of road construction and the player stopped working. It would make a horrible noise every time we would try to play a disk and would freeze after playing 1/2 of the movie. Called cust service for two months before they called me back. They argued that it was now out of warranty, told them to stuff it and that I could prove I've tried calling for months. They finally agreed to give me a new one but took 8 weeks to do so. The replacement I received had the same problem as the one I sent them back, but lower model than one I originally purchased. I will never buy another Mintek item again!!!!!!"
3,"Now or Never, Sooner or Later, Much Later.","This is the 2nd E.A. book that I have read. The problem that I had with this story was first of all, the main Female character.She starts out in the beginning of the story being a strong, sarcastic, television icon. Her sarcasm toward the main male character got old quick. Then, in a flick of the pen, in one page and a paragraph shift, she becomes, frightened and needy. I know this is fiction, but it has to be somewhat believable. The other problem I had, and I have this with several authors, is E.A. compares her character's physical traits with a well know actress or actor (both books). I don't want a picture of Harrison Ford in my mind as I read about the main character. There were small details that were out of place and this annoyed me also. I did appreciate the plot. It was good. I was surprised in the end. I will probably try one more of E.A.'s books, later, much later."
4,Gritty Suspense but Romantic too,This was my second Elizabeth Adler novel and I was surprised at how different this was from the Italian romance she also wrote. The story is exceptionally good but really graphic at times. I hurried over several passages because these are not the kind of images I want to carry around in my head. It pains me to think there are these kinds of people in the world. I'll continue to read Ms. Adler but probably pick one of her romance novels with exotic settings next time.
4,Interesting mix of crime and romance,"This is part crime story and part romance. The plot (in particular, the romance aspect) is a bit predictable, but the suspense, graphic descriptions and action more than make up for it. This is not for 'faint of heart' readers, but for those who aren't overly squeamish, this is one fascinating ride."
2,Wrong color,"I asked the seller before I bought the shoes whether the color on the amazon page was right, as the shoes appeared turquoise there but dark blue on most of the other pages i'd seen. He then replied that the amazon color was the actual color and that they used the correct lighting for their pictures etc. But the color was wrong, they are dark blue not turquoise like I wanted."
1,"Im sure the product works great, if it was what i needed...","When I received it, I thought that is was something else... Although, Im sure the product works great.. There was a major issue returning it. Had major issues there, and the customer service was extremely unacceptable."
4,Not your average yoga class,"I didn't know what to expect with this video. Yogi B, leads a yoga class with his students. The details are already well reported by the other reviewer so I won't go into them. I learned a lot. Yogi B does bark a lot and is kind of insulting to his students. I got the video to see him in action. Since he is no longer alive, I just wondered what he was like. I really love K yoga and feel it's very effective. He is a motivator, it's not sissy yoga. I actually found myself kinda liking that. If you are looking for Kundalini yoga tapes a little more accessible, I love Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's DVD's."
4,Casper The Friendly Ghost,"Includes eight different cartoon shorts(each running from about 6-8 mins):""A Haunting We Will Go""""The Friendly Ghost""""Boo Moon""""Noveltoon""""It's A Hap-Hap-Happy Day""""Hunky and Spunky""""""Bargain Counter""""Toonerville Trolley""Included in the Casper mix are a few obscure old cartoons. Picture quality is okay and sound is a bit muffled. These are very old cartoons probably from the 40's or 50's. Bargain priced and some good old 'spooky' nostalgia."
4,Kids Old Cartoons,"I thought it would be fun to see how my 5 yr. old grandson would re-act to cartoons I watched when young. He said they were pretty cool, but not as good as his."
2,Not the Preferred Choice of Clamps,"The steel band clamp should only be used in one type of application. That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, the steel band clamp is NOT the preferred choice, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to compress and secure the wire rib to the smooth DC fitting. The steel banding and worm screw is not designed to do that task and provide the needed pressure to fully seat the ribbed hose. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the ten cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 75% of the 3"" hose applications with the steel band clamps. I antied up and spent the extra cash and got the right product, the wire clamps for the ribbed DC hose."
5,Great Book!,Wonderful book about the life of Christ. It goes step by step from His birth to the cross. A must read.
5,2nd greatest &most blessed book,This book i have studied for over 10 yrs and always find something inspiring.Its not a reg. book you want to just read through. But one you want to ponder deeply page by page and pray over it before you do because this book has been given by inspiration of God so we need HIS HELP TO GRASP IT.IT IS A BOOK THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE BIBLE BETTER and how our charactors should be.
5,The modern Language Rewrite is even Better,This book is 5 stars but the modern Language rewrite by Jerry Thomas is even better seeMessiah
1,Wrong item!,"I ordered ""The Desire of Ages"" and received ""The Great Controversy instead. It's a great book . . . but it's not what I ordered!"
1,copied work,"Much of this book is copied from ""Night Scenes in the Bible"" by Rev. Daniel March and is not even White's own original thought. Why not just read the original?"
3,From an audiophile point of view...,"I would give this album 5 stars as it deserved it musically. But this is a well known example of a poor recording (mastering) effect. From its original source this album was poorly recorded (what a sin!) so if you are expecting this album to be your reference album to showcase your system abilities and the sacd techonology be aware that it will give you a bad surprise. The audible distortion is evident and it shows. I think its better to have this album on a regular CD, you are not going to gain practically nothing having it in a superior format, only revealing more its recording mistakes. The version I have heard that most satisfies me sonically speaking is the 200 gram super vinyl version, fwiw."
2,Rip-Off,"This is a re-packaging gimmick beyond belief. At the price being asked, you would think Carol would throw in some new material. Shame, shame Carol!"
2,Tapestry-Legacy,I received my item in good time and in good shape. But the two CD set turned out to be the same CD twice. I was very disappointed.
4,Close to perfection,"While ms. King seems to be better in front of a live audience (can't tell, since I've only heard the Carnegie Hall live-album), this album certainly ranks among my personal continuing top 10. A perfect CD for all moments, together, alone, early in the morning and great late in the evening while sitting behind your computer and searching amazon.com for better albums - hard to find!"
5,Great Ending,I like that cd and it is touching and it is relaxing. I like it so much. You are great!
5,Feel the earth move,"As the search for vinyl turned from a romp to the local music store to a search in the antique mall. I realized it was time to switch to CD's. With limited space and no future for many old vinyl friends it was time to round them up and release them to the local used book store. I cried and could only hope they would find a home that would cherish them.It did not take long before I realized I missed them. So now I spend my days waiting for them to be reincarnated. Some that return are so tinny in sound that I can not believe they were that way to begin with. Others are so mangled that the original pattern of tunes is lost for ever.It may be the result of time but I found this album to be all I remember and then some. It is well worth the purchase.""Tapestry"" is the best representation of Carol King and her music. If you only buy one, this is it. And you will feel the earth move under your feet.Carole King - Her Greatest Hits: Songs Of Long Ago"
4,A time machine!,The music on this CD took me back to a much quieter (less hectic) time and space.Very laid back music. Great CD.
5,$5 - really?,"Buy this. Pay $50. One of the best albums of all time. Ok - I speak as someone who went to college in the 70's. But listen to this album, $5 Really? is that 1974 $? Ouch - are Carole King (and I) really that old? (Her, maybe but she looks better than me.)"
4,Timeless,I bought this LP over 40 years ago and it still has the same draw to me today. She is quite the lyricist.
5,One of the greatest. An undeniable 5 star CD,"There seems to be thousands of recordings on Amazon which reviewers apparently rate 5 stars. At the time of my writing this, Tapestry is not listed as one of them! To not give this record 5 stars is like saying Beethoven's 5th symphony is not good music or saying Michael Jordan is not a great basketball player just because you don't like basketball.Tapestry is a true classic. King's songwriting is awesome, probably the best female songwriter ever. She doesn't have the greatest natural voice but there is a sincere human and vulnerable quality to it which is compelling. Add to that the punchy consummate piano style and arrangements and we have one of the all time great records."
5,"Thank You Carole, Simply Wonderful!","I first hear Carole King singing ""Child of Mine,"" on the album ""For our Children"" when I was ten. It was so pretty it made me cry. Years later my Dad bought me her Tapestry album. This is easily her best album. It sold over eleven-million copies in print. It won a number of grammy awards, and has been well loved. I hope it doesn't get worn out. Carole is a great singer and I really want to meet her someday, especially in concert. Ms King, if you ever fall upon this review, do drop me an email. I have some questions I'd like to ask you."
2,Tapestry,"I didn't realize that ""Import"" meant that the CD would not be an original but a re-recorded CD. Am not happy and have not decided whether I will bother to return the CD or not."
3,Lacks punch,Its a very good cd but Carole King sings with so much more enthusiasm now than when she recorded this - it is a bit wishywashy to her true talent.
4,some of the best pop songs of all time...,"...recorded horribly! Almost a sacrilege how poorly this is recorded, considering the incredible talent. Carole King deserves better than this, especially in SACD. Nevertheless, a timeless classic and I'm glad I bought it."
5,So happy I discovered this!!!,"I've heard many of these songs before, but wasn't aware of the album until it was talked about on American Idol. To put it simply, I absolutely LOVE the CD! I only wish I would have found it sooner (the album was released the year I was born). I have become a BIG Carole King fan! She has timeless appeal."
5,still one of my favorites,"I recently saw Carole King on television and began to remember all of her hits.So, I ordered Tapestry. I listened to it in college over and over again in the early 70s. And I can still sing along with every song. And, what a great memory those times were!"
4,"Old classic, necessary for any library.","After going years without a copy, purchasing ""Tapestry"" really does help solidify a library of classic rock, and establish one's perspective with past music writers and today's hits. Long time staples like ""It's too late"", ""I Feel the Earth Move"", and ""Feel Like A Natural Woman"" link the past with the present as many of these songs are re-recorded to soundtracks and video clips. Tapestry established Carole King's excellence as an individual music writer and performer, and brings life to the days of old."
3,This was a gift for a friend,"This album was a gift for a friend, she loved it. She had it once before and it was stolen from her car so she was very happy to have it again. Good and fast service from Amazon.com too."
4,Richly Woven,"This album appeared in the heyday of the sensitive singer/songwriter boom and is still a classic of the genre, like James Taylor's Sweet Baby James which preceded it. The sound is sparse, arranged with moody piano and gentle drums accompanying her intimate observations in an unassuming vocal style. The lyrics are poetic and moving, especially on You've Got A Friend and It's Too Late. But I could never properly assimilate her versions of Natural Woman and Will You Love Me Tomorrow?, since the original versions are simply better. The two new tracks are welcome additions to a pleasant listening experience. Expressive and superbly woven together, Tapestry is an enduring classic that has stood the test of time very well."
3,ACTUALLY 3 and a-half,"Otherwise a great musical and artistic testimonial from a quaint era long gone (and sadly missed), this recording is hampered by hollow vocals, a cheap sound, and all around weak production. The recording, and the artist, deserved better. Was it produced by one of her many enemies? Sure sounds like it. Never-the-less, here-in lies a great collection of pop songs delivered with both dignity, AND alacrity. Despite the unparelled success of the number ""ITS TOO LATE"", the standouts ""...earth move..."", ""...natural woman..."" and, ""You've Got a Friend"", lend depth to a recording that is as much an historical document of 70's zeitgeist, as it is a pop-rock venture."
4,There are a few reasons to like this comp...,"but if anything you should get it just because it has ""Blut Und Ehre"" by Demonic Christ on it, which isn't on the ""Punishment for Ignorance"" album ( I think it's only on the ""promo 96"" thingamabob. Good luck finding that). Plus it's cheap."
5,Thorough and hugely entertaining biography of Sting,"Sting can truly be called a 20th Century Rennaisance Man which this thorough and well-researched book points out several times. Full of facts and anecdotes about a fascinating and multi-talented man. It is a book, not just about Sting, but about the music and entertainment business in the 70s, 80s and 90s. It is a book well worth returning to again and again."
1,VERY poorly written! There's a reason it costs less than a dollar used...,"I could barely finish the introduction without putting it down completely. There was no way I would read such verbose writing - the writer is in love with his own text, making the book almost unreadable. I decided to skim through the book reading a few bits here and there, but I don't think I'll get far (I just started it and felt so strongly I had to write this immediately)."
1,Got jipped 2,Paid for 5 only received one. This item is still mis-marked even after someone else had this problem.
5,Love-Death,"Warning: Capriolo's ""Tosca"" performs open heart surgery on melodrama, pulls back the scrim, dries the blurry tears of sentiment, to show that the core appeal of Puccini's opera is to the death-wish. The author must have composed the novella with her ear on Callas and her eye on Nietzsche and Freud. This is a diabolically beautiful novella, which can be read in about the time it takes to listen to the final act of ""Tristan and Isolde"" -- but read preferably by candlelight."
5,Terrific Book,This is a very good grammar and usage guide for high school and perhaps junior high. It is understandable enough to be used on its own for independent study.
3,It's worth getting,"Ok, I have never actually seen Kickboxers 1 & 2, but after seeing clips from them at the beginning of this movie, I can tell you they are better. Kickboxer 4 is good though in some areas, yet bad in others. The action and fighting - very good. You won't get bored if you like fighting scenes. What I don't like is the final fight, Tang Po looks as if he never had a karate lesson in his life! As for the storyline, not so great. But overall I like it anyway just to see the nice action."
3,"Good Fight Scenes, but not as good as Kicboxer 1 and 2","If you like good fight scenes, then this movie is a good one. Sasha Mitchell apears to have changed his style from traditional kickboxing to more of a muay thai style, and the kumite style tournament is done well. However, Tong Po is played by a different character, and he is by no means as good as the one that played Tong Po in the first two kickboxers. The final fight between Sloan and Tong Po is not even competitive!!!! This movie is worth bying, but dont expect the same quality as the first two kickboxers."
1,Awful everything...,"Enormously bad director Albert Pyun returns to ruin the ""Kickboxer"" series in the fourth installment that has no continuity to the third at all, which is why it fails. The third film had some fun excitement. This one is a depressing, boring work of smut that wants badly to be a martial-arts flick, but instead feels more like a late night soap opera. Full of horrid dialogue, bad choreography, and characters you learn to hate, this film pretty much kills what could have been a fun series. If you're watching the ""Kickboxer"" films, stop at the third. This movie will either depress you or put you to sleep."
1,"Yea Great to See 2 Kickboxer Films at once, unless they 1&2","Yea it is great to see 2 Kickboxer films on the same casette if its only 1 and 2,if you wanna see any Kickboxer films, get 1 and 2, not the worst ones, 3 and 4.Get 1 and 2"
3,Pretty cool.,I saw this on USA over the summer and I thought it was pretty cool. Sasha Mitchell rocks when it comes to the fight scenes though.
3,kickboxer 4 the agressr,Does anyone know that jean claude van damme is tom po in this movie? check it out at the end of movie credits.
5,"Excellent blades, pricey!!","Verrry nice!! Smooth, quiet, seems precise. Pricey! I found some new Onsrud blades made in Germany on Ebay that list for the same $140 price but were selling for $23. It was Onsrud's Ebay store and I believe that these were surplus. Check that out, but buy Tenryu if you have the money."
3,Search and find,"My kids and I have enjoyed the Young Puzzle Adventures books (like Chocolate Island, Dragon in the Cupboard and Land of the Lost Teddies) I was disappointed in this one, however, as it is pretty much a search and find book. The other books really make young kids use their minds. They may be using the process of elimination, or using clues to find a certain path. Spooks Surprise is comprised mostly of looking for ghosts. The story is OK, but doesn't warrant purchasing the book."
1,don't recommend,"Shortly after I purchased this product, the earphone feature stopped working...had to play tapes back on a different recorder if I wanted to listen using earphones. Still used to record since it worked better than my other one to pick up voices in meetings, although not always very clearly; however now I find that it will suddenly just stop recording -as if the tape is stuck- and won't restart unless I tap the machine. Very stressful to have to keep an eye on it! (NOT a problem with the batteries!)"
4,Mustafa Sandal is a great greek singer.,I really enjoyed this cd. It has a great sound and Mustafa Sandal has a great voice.Áüáóá ñáìáéÜ áü cd. é íá ìÜ áé Mustafa Sandal é ìéá ìÜ öùí. Mustafa Sandal ßíáé íáò ìÜò ñáäéóò íéÜ.
1,Misses the critical points,"I was extremely disappointed with this book because it does not even mention autogynephilia much less distinguish between autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals. I was looking for more information on the dominant streams of transsexuality as opposed to a rabid defense of all things ""transgender."" Dr. Ettner's arguments completely ignore the groundbreaking work of Bailey, Lawrence, and Blanchard."
1,A transphobic book,Dr. Ettner is a psychologist who claims to be an advocate for the transsexual community. Her book patronises the transgendered and it is clear that she really thinks of them as suffering from a mental disorder. Her website promotes all sorts of psycho babble that is clearly not legitimate psychological counselling. It is as bogus as the church of scientology. Dr. Ettner is a transphobic person who promotes an agenda that is harmful to transsexual people. Perhaps her transphobia is the problem not socalled gender identity disorder.
1,A review of Confessions of a Gender Defender,This psychologist is yet another person who claims to be a friend of the transsexual community. She pretends to be our advocate but calls us gender dysphoric and considers us diseased. She speaks of her relief that her own child did not show gender confusion. What exactly do you mean by this Ms. Ettner? Transsexualism is not a mental illness. It is just one way of being human. Please stay out of the lives of the transgendered. You are causing tremendous harm promoting your psychological transphobia.
3,Mantovani 20th Century Masters - The Best of Mantovani,This product was 2 days late and so poorly packaged that the plastic jacket was cracked.
1,Do not order this item,"You will not receive what you ordered. I ordered this MIU thermometer after reading the good reviews but instead of getting this thermometer, I received a Chef's instant read thermometer. After complaining with Amazon, they sent me a replacement but the replacement was the same Chef's instant read thermometer. If you are expecting to receive the MIU thermometer, this is not where you will get it. Very disapppointing service from Amazon."
4,Would Have Loved to Make the Actual Trip,"I enjoyed Mary's story VERY much. I was surprised to learn she had been a book editor because I was distracted in the beginning chapters by many sentence fragments and run-on ""sentences"". I learned it was bad form, if not poor grammar to begin a sentence with the word ""And"". I was also confused at some points while trying to follow the story line: Mary skipped the family Thanksgiving for a warm weather trip South...but later in the story, she claims to have visited her aging grandmother in upstate New York over that same Thanksgiving? Maybe I'm reading too literally. I greatly admire her spirit of adventure and her courage in sharing her emotional life with us. I'm left wondering, though: what if Lars had invited her to sail to Europe? Would she have accepted that challenge/invitation?"
3,"Not awful, not great","I've always said that the cure for anything is salt water, so I thought it was funny when I saw this title. I thought the summary sounded interesting, and the book wasn't terrible, but I did not particularly enjoy it either."
2,Almost interesting,"My mother found this book and thought of me because we just got into boating. She did not read the synopsis at all. I read a lot of different kinds of books so I figured this would have some value. The story actually is very well written. The adventure was not all that adventurous but I did learn a little about trawlers. I really did not care for the interjections about her personal life, but not because she is gay. I found her, personally, to be whiney and quite full of herself. Maybe it's normal for East-coasters to be rather snobby. She certainly sounds like someone I would rather avoid. She drinks way too much and I think instead of salt water she may want to try plain water. Jeesh! More boat, less Mary. I wonder if she even goes out in her boat any more."
1,Dull as ditchwater,"The only reason I finished this book was because someone had recommended it to me and I didn't want to disappoint them. The protagonist is a cardboard cutout, the lone Good American among hordes of Nasty Americans who have not achieved his level of enlightenment. The Afghans, Iranians, et al whom he meets on his travels could all be interchangeable, and everyone spends far too much time yammering self-rightous screeds and not actually doing anything.The sad thing is that with the settings and time period, this novel could have been fascinating. But the author has taken golden material and turned it into junk - reverse alchemy, if you will. I'm sure that this book was fascinating to live, but unfortunately that fascination was not translated onto the printed page. Don't waste your time.One star."
2,Dated Vocals Take Their Toll,"What would otherwise be a very good album, in the vein of Freddie Hubbard's ""Red Clay"" and ""Straight Life"" albums, is seriously marred by garish and very dated (it was recorded in 1976) background vocals. This is not meant to diminish some fine work by Woody Shaw on trumpet and Azar Lawrence on saxophone, but those 70s-style vocals get very old very fast."
5,This is my dream cake keeper and carrier!,"I love everything about this cake carrier. It keeps cakes moist for a long time, it is so convenient to pick up and carry around, and you cannot beat the price. I would definitely recommend this cake carrier to my girlfriends and anyone who bakes!"
3,too big,"Beautiful cake caddy,but will not fit in my fridge. It is not 6 inches high, it is 9 inches high including the handle. I can't move the shelf above so I can't keep it."
5,Holds cake securely and keeps cake moist!,"I bought two of these because my husband would receive requests for my cakes at work. As long as the cake has a dollop of icing at the bottom to adhere them to the cake caddy's surface, the cake holds securely. My husband can now leave with my cakes in hand and bring them to work and I don't have to stand at the door reminding him to hold the cake ""just so"", and not to turn corners too fast while driving, in order to avoid mushed cake by the time he gets to work! He can walk from the car to his office without worrying about having to balance both cakes, and he can carry his laptop bag on his shoulder at the same time! If some cake comes back home, the cake keeps its moistness well in the caddy until it is completely finished. I highly recommend it!"
3,Wilton #2105-9952 14x14x8.5 Cake Caddy,"I was disappointed that it holds a cake 10"" x 4"", which is not in the product description. Once I received it, I saw the cake dimensions on the manufacturer's label. I thought it could be used for higher layer cakes."
5,Works great! Puts my mind at ease while transporting cakes.,"I love this caddy. It has removed the stress of transporting my decorated cakes. I usually don't put the cake directly on the bottom of the caddy, but rather on a cake board. It does slide around sometimes, however, it is a slow slide and the sides of the top are high enough that none of my cakes have ever had a smudge in the frosting when I arrived to my destination. I've put a triple layer cake into this caddy, so it is fairly large. I love it!"
2,Arrived broken,"It's a nice, big solid product, but 1 of the 3 latches was broken, which makes it likely that your cake will take a nose dive when you try to carry it somewhere. It's a hassle to return something so big, so buyer beware."
5,HANDY CADDY,PORTABLE CADDY PERFECT SIZE FOR CARTING CAKES TO YOUR FRIENDS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT SMASHING IT!
5,CAKE COVER FOR MY DAUGHTER,"I bought 2, my daughter makes yummy and beautiful cakes. And if I want her to bring me some, I provided these so she always had one at home, and maybe one here. LOL It works -- and she really enjoys the idea. Last time she brought pies. doesn't get any better than that. Convenient, seals, and always full when I get it."
1,WILTON CAKE CADDY,THIS CAKE CADDY WAS CHEAPLY MADE THE CLIPS BRAKE OFF SO EASLY I DO NOT RECOMEND ANY ONE TO BUY THIS
2,This product needs a remake,When I first saw this product on the shelf I thought it was a winner for the price. When I checked it out I noticed that the base was broken so I asked for one that was not broken. Later on I found that the base was easily broken when it fell from three feet which could have damaged the side clamping function. Definitely the plastic base needs to be thicker.
1,Horrible product,"If you'd like to spend 10 hours learning an hour worth of memory tricks, this product is for you. Most of the product is a dialog between two people that drags on endlessly...convincing the listener how awesome the tricks are and how much the product will help you. Most of it is all filler and not much real substance."
3,At least the ~content~ isn't terrible...,"...but the voice acting sure is. Personally, I like the ""discussion-based"" approach of this course. I'm new to memory-improvement courses, so everything here seemed novel and intruiging to me. However, the voice acting is sooo bad...you might just starting counting the times they ~don't~ use a contraction, the corny chuckling, the way one voice actor uses the same expressions over and over...the way they 'almost' seem to have a natural dialog going on...except that they really, really don't.So, if you're willing to put up with the voice acting, and you're interesting in memory-improvement techniques...this seems like a reasonable choice. Personally, I was interested in this particular course because Paul Scheele was involved with it, and I've been impressed with his work before; it's a shame he played such a minor role in this course (from what I can tell, anyhow). I'll probably keep looking for something better...and you may want to do the same."
4,Intreging,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Sanders latest Archie McNally mystery.Although not quite as good as his previous McNally mysteries hestill was able to weave a spellbinding and factual story. I say notquite as good because, although I never try to solve the mystery,the answer jumped right out at me. I hope he and the McNallyfamily never run out of tales to tell"
3,Sanders' style is something you can count on . . .,"After two false starts with other authors, I needed someone I could bank on to give me a quick suspense-novel fix. But as entertaining as ""Puzzle"" was, Lawrence Sanders seems pretty much on autopilot with this one, and there was zero suspense in it as far as I am concerned. But I like the Archie McNally formula, and generally enjoyed the book!"
3,Fun Sleuthing,"Archy McNally's back on the case.Is an exotic bird dealer, who happens to be a client of old man McNally, going crazy or is someone really threatening to kill him?When a body turns up, the investigating turns serious. Binky Waterous assists by going undercover in the pet shop. Archy tries to gain info from the client's twin daughters. Fun sleuthing."
4,Humorous Thriller,"You've got to love Sander's main character, Archy McNally, a private investigator. Told in the first person, it's as though McNally is talking directly to you, the reader. Not afraid to laugh at himself, he has you laughing with him.Even though it's a ""who done it"" murder mystery, it is also a reminder that events in our lives can be looked at from several perspectives. Each of the events is only a piece of life's puzzle. I found this an uplifting read."
4,"Aw, shucks ...","I liked this one - not because it had much substance, but perhaps because I'm getting nostalgic, as there's only one more Sanders book left. This one included lots of food and drink at the Pelican Club, and his father working his way through Dickens, of course. You gotta love it."
2,What an odd story told in an odd way by an odd character...,"I am reviewing this from the perspective of having heard it as a book-on-tape.Archy McNally, the self-proclaimed 'Bon vivant' narrates an odd story that is made all the more odd by his continual need to turn a clever expression - nearly in every sentence! It gets to the point where it is distracting! The characters are pretty two-dimensional. Some seem like they were stolen right out of a high school production of ""The Great Gatsby"" - stereotypes of what we might suspect the rich and famous might be like. Heck, the only rich guy I liked in the book was killed! (on the other hand, I liked the cop and the dog.)If it were not for the absolutely great voice work of Boyd Gaines it probably would not have been palatable for me. If I could give a seperate star for voice work,his would be a 5."
3,Norton's Favorites!,"Irish-born comedian Graham Norton in this very small book gives us his pick of his favorite gay icons. Each little biography includes a picture of the favorite star, drag queen, singer, actor or performer. I enjoyed several of his picks like k.d.lang, Divine, Grace Jones, Alain Delon, Madonna, etc. I highly disagreed with his picks of Jeffrey Dahmer, Francis Farmer, Roger Moore, and Liberace. Some of his picks are meant to be controversial, and they are. This is just one of a series of books put out about 20th Century Icons. Graham's royalties from this book go the Terrance Higgins Trust, the UK's leading HIV and AIDS Charity. A good cause. I found this book enjoyable, especially the gay icons that I personally chose. An interesting little book!"
5,Does a Great Job,"When installing a dust collection system, eliminating resistance to airflow is what it is all about. The ideal is as large a pipe as possible, flowing in a straight line, without any ridges in the surface. Of course in the real world at least some of these things wind up being less than ideal. What this Jet 4"" Y-connector does, is give you a large pipe, that makes a gradual Y as opposed to a straight 90 degree angle T, and the sides of the connector are smooth. So when you need to divide your air source into two lines, this elbow does the nicest job.The advantage of incorporating a Y connector into your system, is that you can take a single air source, connect this Y connector to it, a pair of gates, and no longer have to switch your hoses between two different pieces of equipment. All you do is open the gate to one, and close it to the other. All in all highly recommended."
5,Mr,"so far so good with this helmet it fits better than other helmet that i have own ,love the color it matches my honda gold wing .the gold wing has a big and wide windshield ,but if you use this helmet with a bike with a lower windshield or with no windshield you will need goggles because even with glasses you are going to have a hard time seeing ."
5,Shoei RJ helmet,"This is a great open face helmet. I have purchased Shoei in the past and they run true to size every time. Additionally, the shipping time was super! Very pleased with this purchase."
5,Great Helmet,"I bought this to replace an aging RJ Platinum Air that I wore so much the foam liner started deteriorating. This helmet is a newer version of that helmet and it has its plusses and minuses. The plus is it is much lighter and sits a little higher on your head. I've not noticed any ventilation issues so I guess that's a good thing. The minus is the cheek pieces come ""out"" further and initially they bugged me but I guess now I'm getting used to them. I liked the strap stay on the old version better since this one has one of the little plastic snaps. Overall a great helmet but I wish Shoei would have stuck to their old shell shape."
5,Classic collection of those all-time BJ Thomas hits,This is the pinnacle of all collections of BJ Thomas' greatest hits. All people out there who consider themselves BJ Thomas fans should include this in their personal collection!
3,"Leaks, short throat","These are more durable then the plastic ones for sure. But they leak around the edges and the closing plate bounces around and does not really shut until backpressure builds up. Also the closing plate, if unit is mounted vertically, will close by itself due to gravity. The locking screw is a pain when you want to quickly close and open gates. Seems like it would not have been too much trouble to add the $.02 worth of gasket to properly seal the unit and give the closing plate some friction so it doesnt close by itself.The attachment throats are very short making it difficult to clamp to hose or pipe. Silicon caulk is the only way to attach it to solid pipe."
2,Cost Way TOO Much,"These are the same product and quality that you can buy from various sources, but these are 1/3 again as much!!No matter whos' you buy expect to have to use some silicon to seal them up or they will leak mercilessly.I hope this helps and, Good Luck with your own dreams!"
5,Ecco Men's RXP 6010,all I can say is that the shoe is excellent quality and extremely comfortable like other Ecco brand name.
3,This is NOT Marcos Resende,"Buyers beware, this CD is sold as Marcos Resende's, but is actually a CD by guitarist Agusto Renno.I have not listened to Mr. Renno's CD, so my rating is just intended to the misprint (confusion) of the artist's name."
4,This CD is some pretty good listening.,"This CD contains some excellent punk. My personal favorite band on the CD is the ""Latex Generation"", their songs are the best, and they have an excellent cover of the song ""Fallen Angel"". This is the kind of CD whose songs will pop into your head at any given moment and stick with you for an hour. I definitely recommend this album."
5,"U.S. Chaos: Tops ""Punk Dwellings"" ""New Yorks Finest""","From the onset of the punk incarnation, U.S. Chaos is known as the first founding, british influenced (Oi!) or punk band in the United States. Formed in 1979 they have fathered more roots in the east coast rocknroll than 99.9% of what is now current have influenced. The bands success in the 1990's atributed with conglomeration with Marty Munsch-The ""Phil spector of punk"". These tracks were produced by munsch with a vehement feeling of hatered towards the processed newer music of the ninteys. From a pure time in the 1980's munsch pressed U.S.Chaos into furious behavior during the sessions. This is punk."
5,Best Bedtime Book EVER!,"I am so excited that this book has been reissued! I used to read this book at bedtime to my 2 oldest children when they were preschoolers and it was bedtime magic. Its a soothing collection of short stories and poems best read in a soft, whispering voice that never failed to put my children to sleep. Now I have another preschooler at home, but my older children's copy of this book is long gone. I've watched used book sales for several years now, trying to find another copy so that my youngest can enjoy it. I was thrilled to find the new edition available on Amazon tonight! After my youngest out grows it, this copy will be tucked away for future grandchildren."
3,Preaching To The Choir,"Stephen Law has written a very informative book on the importance of liberal education for children. He argues persuasively that liberalism does NOT entail absolute moral relativism or the education of children without behavioral standards.Nevertheless, I did not find his book to be particularly enlightening. Being a liberal, I found that Law simply comfirmed what I already suspected or knew. I also doubt that many who adhere to a more ""authoritarian"" model of child rearing will be convinced otherwise by this book.If you're looking for a book that provides justification for liberal education, this is a good place to start. If you're looking for a guide on how to provide a liberal education for your child, look elsewhere."
5,Awesome DVD,I loved this DVD. It inspired me to try my hand at fixing up some garage sale furniture I had purchased. Now I get compliments on my desk all the time. David has a great flair for explaining and demonstrating his techniques. I highly recommend his tapes/DVDs!
4,"Not just ""pilgrims and pioneers""","One reviewer described it as a fine adventure story for boys, but I enjoyed it as a girl. I grew up in the Southwest, the history of which gets little attention from the rest of the country, even among the Northerners and Easterners who choose to relocate here in droves. Most are not even aware that the land they have overtaken was once part of Mexico, and the remainder simply do not wish to know. Komantcia was a nice change from the usual Noreuropean-oriented ""pilgrims and pioneers"" subject matter largely available to young people."
3,Miss Mackenzie,"Clean and presentable. But this impression does not come with a glossary of Trollopian terminology, nor with an editor's Introduction. For the student of the Trollope oeuvre, therefore, it is not entirely satisfying."
4,A classic Victorian novel,"Miss Margaret Mackenzie is a lonely young woman when she receives an inheritance after the death of her brother Walter which amounts to 800 a year, quite a substantial allowance in the 1860s. Subsequently Margaret moves from London to Littlebath where she takes care of her niece Susanna. Being fair and wealthy, she becomes the object of desire of three gentlemen in particular: her cousin John Ball, Mr Maguire the clergyman and Mr Rubb, junior partner in the company of her brother Tom. Margaret's destiny changes abruptly when her lawyer tells her that actually Walter's money is not hers since it was given to her before Jonathan Ball's death and that it belongs to John Ball.Mr Trollope casts a critical glance at all the intricacies of the Victorian era: money, social position, marriage and business. Nevertheless, the novel is a suspenseful family saga and the plot is so cleverly constructed that it surpasses many a story written in the 21st century."
2,Typically Victorian novel,"This is a classic Victorian novel, and the verbosity is typical of the period. The plot is predictable, though buried in an excess of words. Trollope is amusing in places, particularly with the puns on names, but this is not a truly prominent part of the book. I did find the characters well drawn throughout. After reading this novel, I do have to say, I am disinclined to read any more of Trollope's works. Only my determination not to let this book defeat me kept me reading to the end."
4,Good...but almost too good,"I've tried one other brand of melatonin, 3mg, from a friend (which is why I can't remember the brand) but the ""normal"" vs. time released is a big difference. With the non-time released, I fall asleep fast, however I do wake up about 4 hours later. It is usually quite easy to fall back to sleep though. With this natrol timed release, it is about equally as effective at helping to fall asleep, without any interruption in the night. Yet I have more trouble waking up and feel considerably more groggy in the am. I've decided to switch back to non-timed release, but I still give this 4 stars as it does exactly what it says, the whole 8 hours of it. I am somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I think my reaction to this melatonin may reflect that, as the ""tired"" feeling can extend 9-10 hours after I fall asleep."
1,not what it used to be,"I have bought natrol time released melatonin a few years ago and it worked, but now it makes no difference when we take it."
4,Melatonin Time Release,"Works much better than regular melatonin, wife uses and sleeps better through the night. We bought the 3 mg and 5 mg, based on other reviews. The 3 mg seems to work better."
3,The 3 mg Melatonin is worse for me than its 5 mg version,I ordered Melatonin of two types - 3 mg and 5 mg for my sleepign disorders. I am much happier with the 5 mg Melatonin as it does not happen to have side effects on me that the 3 mg Melatonin does - which is superficial sleep with too much dreaming and sometimes heavy dreams. I am much less happy with the 3 mg Melatonin. When I wake up I do not feel as rested as with the 5 mg one.I do not think I will be buying the 3 mg one again.
1,don't bother,how can it be time release when it is a tablet! don't you need a capsule with different size granules so they dissolve at different times!
1,"Overly Strong, Caused Nausea","When I first took the pill, I was shortly overcome with extreme sleepiness. And I did not feel all the good, I felt weird. The extreme sleepiness wore off after an hour or two. In the morning I had nausea. I don't know if it's me or the product but it didn't work out for me."
3,Eh....,"I work 3rd shift and being a morning person, I really struggle with sleeping during the day. I bought this after hearing others say how great it works. While I do believe it helps me fall asleep, it does not help me stay asleep. I still wake up after just a few hours. Though, unlike some sleep aids, it does not leave me feeling groggy."
1,Time release hasn't worked well for me. I prefer the regular melatonin. order was a two -pack and It's too late to return one,Dont like the time release..Prefer the regular melatonin. Disappointed. Bought a two pack because it was the best deal economically but it hasn't worked for me and now I'm unable to return 2nd bottle because it's too late but had no way of knowing it's quality until giving it a reasonable try. Would not buy again. Very disappointed. Have had to resort back to sleeping pills because this failed to live up to what was advertised. I thought the time release would be a step up and better but it's not. The regular melatonin worked better. Upset that I cant return the 2nd bottle. It's useless to me! Wasn't a bargain or good deal afterall.
5,Melatonin Time Release Tabs,"The important thing for me in ordering this particular product of Melatonin 3mg is that it is time released into the system throughout the night. The time release tabs are hard to find, and was thrilled that I was able to find time release tabs on Amazon. The product itself works very well for me making me sleepy enough to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. As I say, time release tabs are difficult to find."
2,Does not help you fall asleep,"Thee pills did not help me fall asleep any faster. Also, since these are just supplements, they have not been ""evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration"".What I have noticed though is that I have more dreams that I can remember while I am taking these. Might be just placebo effect though, I don't know."
2,Time Released Melatonin,I purchased the time relased Melatonin because I have the tendency to wake during the night. As usual I fell asleep easily with the Melatonin but woke up after 2-3 hours so I do not see the benefit of buying this product.
4,I had a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep.,"Since I've been taking the melatonin TR, I've been getting a very good night sleep.I would recommend it to anyone that has sleepless nights."
5,Very good product,"The sublingual form is much more effective, sooner, than the oral. They made a 5mg one for awhile & that was even better than the 3mg but it's not available anymore that I know of. It helped me fall asleep but that wasn't the real problem. It was staying asleep. I now use an oral 5mg melatonin as a supplement because older people don't usually produce enough. I just get it locally & it works well now that I've solved more of the other sleep problems I had."
5,"Great ""add-on"" value","As an Amazon Add-On product, this is a great deal. As far as I know melatonin is melatonin and it seems to work for me. I can't really speak to the quality of this brand versus other brands, but I have no complaints."
4,It does the job I expected it to.,I recommend this product to anyone who has trouble sleeping and/or relaxing. There is no lingering side effects or sleepiness.
3,"Worked well, but made me drowsy the next day","This worked well but I felt drowsy the next day. My dad says that it is impossible to make me drowsy the next day but I felt like I had NO energy. I have taken melatonin in the past and it hasn't worked very well but this one did the trick for sleeping, just not the energy factor."
5,The soaring voice of a Goddess,"From start to finish - this is a Cd that can be listened to over and over again. While other blast it for being a covers duet - it works! Ann knows how to weave and craft her voice around every song and every guest vocalist.eagerly awaited as her solo project - it could not have been better, this is what she chose to release and I'm good with that - each song has a little something from my past that I am glad to hear her voice on...especially Bad Moon Rising - CCR should be proud that this song lasts the test of time and is now touched by one of the greatest living female rock singers in the known universe!Rock On Ann...Peace and Love to you, as always! :-)"
2,warm milk at bedtime,"We bought Ann Wilson's new disc on advice of a positive newspaper critical review. So the disc has its fans. But we miss her ability to belt out her marvelous arena filling vocals. Perhaps the next disc, although this disc printed inserts are very informative and have panache all their own. Miss wilson? Put some more GLORY in it for our taste."
2,A great disappointment from one who is a long time fan.,"I've been a fan of Ann & Nancy collectively as Heart (especially the original lineup - which sadly has never been duplicated in all of their recent performances). I was excited as all Ann and Heart fans were to hear about this forthcoming new solo project from Ann. Once I got it I waiting through the whole disc to hear something I could REALLY enjoy. There were brief moments of some of what I've come to expect from Ann, but nothing that lives up to anything previously done with Heart or even in duets with other artists. I had ""Hope"" for an album of ""Glory""-ious songs, but just never hit the mark for me. And the live DVD performance of the Dreamboat Annie album has video clips of the group playing several of the songs on this solo project as bonus songs which seems to have continually poorer back up musicians than p[revious live DVD's."
2,Hoped for Glory,"I had high hopes for this release. I've been a long time fan of Heart and think Ann has one of the greatest female voices in rock. The album doesn't rock out and show her full voice. It would also have been nice to hear her own songs instead of all those covers. I would skip this and wait for a new Heart album. Be careful, listen to the clips before you purchase it."
5,Ann Wilson's First Solo Work,"Ann Wilson has done a superb job with her new first solo album ""HOPE AND GLORY"". not only is her voice the fine quality it always is, the songs themselves are really incredible! KUDOS for the excellent line up!! Never thought anyone could perform Pink Floyd's ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" or Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" but these renditions are incredibly good! The guest artists leave nothing at all to be desired. Wonderful choices!!WELL DONE!!"
5,Ann Wilson music disc,This item arrived earlier than committed to by the vendor and as described. I would gladly purchase additional items in the future from this vendor.
5,What an amazing album!,"I've owned this CD since it came out in 2007. Ann Wilson is one of those classic rock voices that simply puts chills on you. She stand out even today among the younger generation of female rockers. Her voice is as unique as Stevie Nicks, whom I also love, but the exceptional range in Ann's voice is staggering even after all these years.Initially I was disappointed that it was an album of covers. It's not just an album of covers ... it's Ann speaking out about what was going on in the world in 2007 ... it's Ann pulling rock classics that transcended the decades to remain relevant. My favorite track is not a remake ... Ann wrote one track for the album - a simple song called ""Little Problems, Little Lies"" and I still tear up a bit every time I hear it. Her voice as a storyteller in this song is powerful. She makes you feel like you are in the song.Guest spots from sister Nancy Wilson, Elton John, Allison Kraus, Wynonna and others make this an album worth buying!"
4,Excellent Interpretations,"Ann does a wonderful job in covering songs done by other artists and putting her own signature to them. People not liking the versions here won't like Hendrix doing ""All Along the Watchtower"" either. Great versions of Neil Young, Jesse Colin Young, Dino Valente, Lucinda Williams, Elton John, Page/Plant and John Fogerty songs. All worth a listen and some are truly exceptional. Well done Ann."
5,authentic and heartfelt,"I grew up listening to Heart and Patti Smith, and despite their different styles each had in common intellect, authenticity (meaning that their songs seemed to be who they are instead of just showing off what they could do), and the hard sound I craved but felt alienated from in the dude-oriented hard rock of the time.Heart lost me a little during the arena rock bombast time of the 1980s but I never stopped loving Ann Wilson's voice.Play this. Sample the CD. This music will make you happy to be alive just because it is a great expression of personal honesty. People reaching out in an attemtp to connect in perilous times. Ann Wilson is timeless and classic, and I wish that those who, for example, think Immigrant Song suffers in comparison with the original could get the same fresh sense of it form Ann Wislon that I do.I just played this for the first time, and it is going right back on repeat."
5,pleasent surprize,"its hard for me to say, some of these songs are as good if not better then the originals, pink floyd, led zep, dylan, both youngs, my heros. it is almost blasphemey for me to type this, but she is rockin' and every bit as talented as any of the originals are. I love all the different synths. and strings. very tasty, Ann if you are reading this, Thanks. do it again. please. everyone should get at least one. peace"
4,Ann Wilson - Still One of the Best Rock Vocalists Ever,"Ann Wilson reinstates herself as rock vocal goddess on Hope & Glory. I give it four stars, really only because it's an album of cover songs. But her unique voice, power and subtlety all combine nicely on these vintage songs from the 70's...One of the gems includes It's a War of Man and this is textbook Ann Wilson combining power with melody to evoke raw emotion, creating a wonderful ominous sea of melancholy angst in her interpretation of this Neil Young poetry. I've also witnessed her live show recently and her voice only seems to get stronger with each passing year/album/decade. Hope & Glory solidifies my claim that Wilson is the best female 'rock' vocalist of our time."
2,Too little good authentic folk music here.,"If you're looking for authentic folk music, don't look here. Many of the numbers are inappropriately ""modernized""- words or entire lyrics are changed, perhaps in the effort to make them more palatable to contemporary listeners. (And in my opinion, these changes are not the result of what is often called the ""folk process."") Instrumental accompaniment and singing style also too often do not fit the mood of the songs. One example: the version of ""Barbara Allen"" would make Barbara and her lover turn over in their grave! To give credit where credit is due, there are some well done songs in this collection. But I'd advise looking into more totally authentic collections, such as Folkways' ""Anthology of American Folk Music,"" and ""Folk Song America: A 20th Century Revival."""
5,An antidote for emotion run amok inside the Beltway,"This is the one book on abortion all the politicians, and all the partisan proponents of one side over the other, should read. I read it in one life-changing session. Bringsjord treats abortion with logic -- emotion is banished. The result is true progress that people here in DC would do well to capitalize upon, whether pro-life or pro-choice."
5,The essential W B Yeats,"A must have if you are a lover of poetry. I love this collection, it has brought me so much joy"
4,A beutiful and worthy item for any library,"This is a very beautiful book, handsomely binded and edited. It includes all of Yeats poetry and is very worthy the price. Any poetry lover got have this one. The only complaint is that it does not always includes the early versions of many poems, like ""Brown Penny"". The version presented here is the last version edited by Yeats and differs very much, at the end, from the most known version. Aside that it is a flawless edition. I truly recommend it."
4,Gotta Get This Book!,"A great, concise review of the St Louis Rams 1999 quest for the NFL championship. Meet and read about the key personalities that made this team one of the most explosive and opportunistic of the decade. Learn why and how this team set a new standard for professional football as we move into the new millenium. Beautifully illustrated and an excellent addition to any sports collection for the young or young-at-heart fan."
1,I wouold wait until ad. is corrected.,"Sellers information indicates that clock Also comes with a New Cherry Wood base. However, the product information indicates that the base is sold seperatly.WHICH IS IT?"
4,Two avangarde giants,Our requirements from such a persons like Braxton and Frith are always high. I was not disappointed. Cooperation of two individuals is perfect.
4,A Splice is a Nice Splice,"Not a real technical piece of equipment, but it is 3"" on both sides, the hose fit easliy over each end and the wire clamps fit snuggly, putting it all together.Using the splice allowed for use of the entire hose, especially since I cut the ten foot section into exact lengths for the different equipment and branches on the DC system."
2,Guess I don't have the proper technique,"I've used this a few times, trying a make some tomato sauce from my home grown tomatoes. But I have trouble with this - its cumbersome to balance on a bowl and turn the handle - the tomatoes seem to get stuck and I'm hand pushing them under the blade. So, after all this wonderful fun, what do I have - tomato juice with seeds! I gave up and put it away. If anyone knows what I am doing wrong - please help me. I used one a million years ago and really can't remember any problems or not being happy with the end product."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Very disappointing product. Besides the fact that the disks are not very sharp, the unit is difficult to stabilize on any pot or bowl in our kitchen, making it difficult, if not downright dangerous, to use. it also was missing one of the three disks it was supposed to come with. We got two of one size, and one of another, and as luck would have it, the missing disk was the one we needed most. Any savings completely negated as it's nearly unusuable."
2,Great until you try to change the disks.,I absolutely loved this food mill until I tried to change the disk. Neither I nor my husband could get the disk back into the mill properly once I took it out to change disks. I finally pushed so hard the mill broke. Going to try the Oxo next.
4,Maybe not for me.,"I guess its a good food mill, but I'm not as into it as I thought I would be. It only grinds up soft foods. And even then, the food needs to be in chunks.I tried to make hummus with it, but the onions got stuck. I guess thats my own stupidity. So no onions. But, the chickpeas went through fine. I haven't tried raws garlic yet. It would be cool it the thing could handle raw garlic. Or, I could just get a garlic press.Anyway, I just think this item is not my thing. Even with tomatoes, I am personally fine with using canned tomato, for general eating.I do have to admit, spaghetti sauce, or whatever tomato sauce you make, is amazing when using fresh tomatoes. I will probably use this mill, for that, for special occasions."
3,Baby Food,"This machine is okay.No directions, but it is pretty self explanatory to use.The hand crank is pretty hard to turn, I hope it will become easier the more it is used.I like that it is dishwasher safe."
4,Could have been a bit cheaper,"It could have been a bit cheaper but I can't complain. It does a good job. I made leak and potato soup with this and it turned out beautifully. I liked it better than when i used my food processor to make the soup. After cooking, I put it in the dishwasher. No problem. It didn't get rusty or anything. Also beautiful job with tomato sauce. I'd recommend this to anyone."
4,Does the job,"I ordered this food mill to make baby food for my son. I had wanted to combine pureeing and straining and make the whole operation more efficient. The food mill does a pretty good job, it's still kind of time consuming to do but it's not bad. Some fibers manage to make it through even the fine strainer, but I don't think that's a big deal. It's better to work with very mushy vegetables to get the best yield, though. My first batch I had cooked my green beans ""al dente"" and I didn't get as much as I expected thru the strainer. the next time I steamed the heck out of them and the yield was much better. The food mill also seems to be very well made and I'm sure will outlast my need for it. It will make great mashed potatoes and applesauce."
1,worst buy ever,"MIU Stainless-Steel Tomato/Vegetable MillI bought this item hoping to strain tomatoes for sauce making and also for soups.The blade simply will not catch the food and push it through, be it tomatoes, potatoes or any other soft vegetables. The food will just spin forever and never get processed. A waste of $30."
3,"Just okay, not superior.",I had researched food mills and really thought this one would be great. It's just okay. It can be difficult to turn and feels a bit flimsy. It also can only fit over one size bowl with it's supports which makes it a bit inconvenient.
3,Made in China,"I was under the impression that this was 'made in France' -- and it was made in China. Making my money go farther and have the items I purchase be worth more, I am staying away from metal products made in China -- I am constantly disapointed.However, this mill seems to be a good quality. Longevity ... we'll see."
2,NOT MADE IN FRANCE,This item was MADE IN CHINA. I was mislead to believe it was made in France. The handle bends and buckles when you use the mill. I don't know how long this is going to last.
5,Ideal Cooking Assistant,Wanted to get a light weight good quality Hand Mill and this one's ideal. - Seems to be good quality & great for using fresh tomatoes to make pasta sauce.
1,Food Mill,"Disapoionted in product. It apeared to not be in new condition as it had been opened before and there were no instructions or suggestion booklets. I sent an e-mail to Amazon but received no responce. Product difficult to put together and no suggestions booklets or company information--just what was on the box. I didn't open the box until the day I needed the mill and didn't have time to go to the store and get one, so I used it. Next time I get anything from Amazon, I will open it right away, skip any comoplaint process and just reject anythig that is not acceptable and get it somewhere else. I'm new to Amazon, but now am very leery."
4,Learn how to use it and it works great,"As you read the reviews on this unit, it falls under two sets. Those who figure out how this work give it a 4 to 5 stars. Those who have no idea how this works give it a 1 to 2 stars. People, comment when you know what you are doing before you can rate it. Compaints about how difficult it is to swap out the disk, go to the company website [...] and view the short video. Not very hard. Now on the unit itself. Depending on the food item, some are harder to mill than others. Tomatoes are the best, perfect for making fresh sauces. Potatos are a bit tougher but if you cook it long enough , it will mill easier. This goes for all food mills so complaints about how tough it was to grind it would apply to all the other brands too. So if you like your food freshly prepared this unit works like it intended, nice stainless steel surfaces, fairly large capacity and a great deal"
1,inimical to arthritic hands,"Inserting and removing a disk was almost impossible. I suspect it would be difficult for anyone with weak hands. There is no reason for the disks to be so difficult to manipulate. Our former mill, simply a smaller version of this, gave us absolutely no trouble. Had it for many decades; finally, a part of it broke."
4,It works fine if you can figure it out without the directions.,"In response to the other reviews...No there are no directions included with this food mill, but it works fine. As to putting the disk in upside down, I'm not sure how you could make this mistake, you couldn't even come close to assembling it with the disk upside down. However, you might accidently put two disks on top of the each other. It comes with the coarse disk already in place and you might think at first glance that the finer disks go on top of this disk. Just take out the coarse disk and put in the one you wish to use. Turn the handle clockwise. It works just fine and for the price it is a great buy."
4,Balanced and Sturdy,"I bought this to replace my Amco model from Sur La Table. The AMCO was $80 but was poorly balanced and didn't work well at all. I like this model for several reasons--1) It balances well on the bowl because of the three leg design2) It strains well. Please note that you have to crank the handle in both directions to keep the food moving through the holes3) It comes apart easily for cleaning and reassembles quickly4) The bowl is wide for holding about 1-2 cups of food at a timeI agree that you can't attach it to a larger bowl because of the short legs, which is the only drawback I have found so far.In short, I recommend the product and believe it is sturdy enough for long term use, although I only use it occasionally for making applesauce."
1,hopeless,"this product was recommended to me by several people, so imagine my surprise when it failed to work at all! i froze a summer's worth of tomatoes, then at thanksgiving i thawed them with the intention of making tomato sauce. i put two completely thawed tomatoes in the mill, started cranking, and they immediately released their water into the pot. i can't make sauce out of water, so i kept cranking, hoping that eventually the pulp would make it's way out. no joy. the pulp and the skin just kept spinning, and the skin got stuck in the holes and plugged the whole thing up. and that was using the plate with the largest holes. maybe it's because the tomatoes were frozen? anyway, i ended up just putting them in a blender skins and all. not ideal, but at least i have something to show for it. not sure if it is just this mill, or if all mills are ineffective."
5,Saved my writing career!!!,"I can not tell you enough how impressed i was with this book!!!! This book changed my life!! I was working on a few books at the time and i was feeling rather overwhelmed; my storie was flopping in the middle, it just didn't seem to be going aywhere! I basically gave up and didn't plan to finish at all when i saw this book and thought, ""Well, maybe this is the motivation i need."" After the first few pages i was on a roll!! I worked and worked into the wee hours of the morning and had my entire story, from start to finish, planned out in a very satisfactory manner!!! This book saved my writing career!! THANKS SO MUCH!!"
3,Little juice...,"I'm not one of those guys who've read a thousand books on writing, so I'm not a pro. In fact, this is only the 3rd book I'm reading about fictional writing.I bought this book hoping to find some help about structure and plot. What I found is that it gives the reader a lot of titles, but it under-develops the content of them, providing fewer examples than those I thought needed. I ended up with lists of structure models, dramatic situations and so on, but with very little clues on how to apply them.In a way, I found that the author didn't know as much about the topic being discussed as she was supposed. It's like she's learned it from college, but lacks the deep, experiential understanding.It's still a helpful book, but very shallow. I found ""How to write a damn good novel"" and ""Writing fiction for dummies"" much more enlightening."
2,Its like reading stero inststructions,This is a book I was very excited to get. However it's very boring to read.The author lends no motivation to finish reading.
3,Poorly written.,"I wish this book were easier to read! I'm interested in Schmidt's plot configurations, but her writing is so flat and repetitive that reading it is the literary equivalent of eating cardboard. Here's a quote: ""Obtaining means to acquire or to succeed in gaining possession as the result of planning."" Thanks. But why do I need to read that? If I'm not familiar with the word ""obtaining"" I'm probably not really up to writing a book, or even reading one.As another reader pointed out, many of her examples are Hollywood bombs. That may simply be a limitation of this type of a guide, but it's even more discouraging, as I slog through the pages trying to get a few structural ideas, to think that the best I might end up with is something like ""Striptease."" I think I'd forgive the author this if her prose wasn't so stiff. Her editor is also to blame."
4,A Good Book for any Author's Writing Resource Shelf,"Whether you write fiction or non-fiction, you still have to tell stories that compel the reader to continue reading. It can be a challenge for even the most seasoned author to create solid characters and spell-binding dramatic situations. This book is a great reference tool to stimulate, instigate, and provide that epiphany you need to muddle through the slow spots of writing. It is also a valuable tool for anyone teaching the art of story design.This is not a book for reading cover to cover. It is more of a reference guide for writers of all experience levels."
2,Could I get the polemic on the side?,"There is a lot of good in this book, and many of the exercises are quite helpful in plotting, but I found the author's use of gender to be annoying and seemingly arbitrary. I don't believe that happy endings are masculine and tragic endings are feminine, and I don't think the sex of the character is the most important thing--or even in the top ten for most characters. I suppose that the sexualizing of dramatic moments is inevitable, given the current educational climate, but it made some otherwise useful portions of this book nigh-unreadable.I'll be honest, I got it for free, so I can't complain. But if I had paid for it I definitely would."
2,False Photo - not what you see,"Wish I'd read Pumpkin's review first, but I concur - they were NOT the slip-on ones shown in the photo which is what I wanted."
2,Doesn't cut down on the confusion,"Coming into Spamassassin as a new user is very confusing, especially if you don't admin e-mail systems frequently. The spamassassin wiki and documentation are really confusing as well, it seems that nothing really explains the system as a whole very well. Finally, a real book about Spamassassin (I thought). This book skipped over a lot of topics I want to know more about (logging spamassassin activity, how to install razor and pyzor, more information about the RBLs installation and configuration). I don't think so much time should have been spent on Baysean techniques, I find Baysean to be too labor intensive and not practical at all on a site-wide level (which I think the author mentions in the book). This book was good, but not as complete as I was expecting, but as a reference for Spamassassin I suppose it's ok, but not anything better than is online."
3,Rebels Looking For A Cause,"Marlon Brando stars as the leader of a biker gang that invades a small town and turns everything upside down. To be honest, these bikers don't seem particularly dangerous, and some of the dialogue is so rooted in the Fifties' slang I found myself laughing out loud. However, the Brando performance makes the movie worth a look, and he has an interesting relationship with the sheriff's daughter. I'm sure this film had a much bigger impact on its Fifties audience than it does nowadays. For me it was a step back into another time for seventy minutes."
2,"Brando is great, film not so much....","Overly dramatic, though typical for '50s outcast characterizations. Brando is believable as a rebel and the best part of the film is the painful past you see behind his eyes, as well as the invisible wall he puts up. Of course it takes enormous talent to put those feelings across without vocalizing them; the director's importance of keeping the rebel's past and feelings a mystery IS the film's essence. But the plot itself is not enough for me to recommend the film or want to see it again."
4,Heck on Wheels.,"This movie starts out showing that appeasement is wrong and just buys you trouble. The cyclists are repelled from one town by a cop who stands up to them, and then go on to the next place which cottons to them, for a while anyway.There are some good scenes and a few good lines, though. Surely we've all seen clips of Brando's character response to the question, ""What are you rebelling against?"" with the deft reply, ""Whaddya got?""When he starred in this, Lee Marvin wasn't too far out of the WWII Marines, and it shows."
3,th wild one,"although the film itslef is a classic. The dvd is not much better than the vhs version. The sound and video is not at all improved and there are very few extras on it. It is nice to have in a format that will last longer, but besides that this dvd doesnt have much to offer."
5,Your Motorcycle Film Collection Should Start Here,"Do not miss this original. Before Hollywood started mass producing increasingly awful, stereotyped, and trashy biker movies there was The Wild One. Very loosely based on actual events, this story spawned all those cheesy bike films that never even come close to The Wild One's solid storyline, great acting, and fabulous soundtrack. If you've ever suffered threw a lousy biker film, treat yourself to this wonderful film that is THE original. Just the sight of a very drunken Chino (Lee Marvin) riding into town on a Panhead to stir things up with Johnny's(Marlon Brando)Black Rebels is worth the puchase price.Long live the BRMC!"
4,CLASSIC BIKER FLICK,THIS IS A MUST HAVE CLASSIC BIKER MOVIE. THIS IS ONE OF IF NOT THE FIRST RECOGNIZED MOTORCYCLE GANG MOVIE.IF YOUR A BIKER FAN YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS ONE.
4,Mesmerizing plot!,"With this movie Brando became in a icon for all a generation; somehow Brando meant the breakthrough with the past. His style and strong personality let him to establish not only as an irreverent actor but far beyond, but in an actor of multiple skills , with the trademark of a new method far away from the english models as Alec Guiness , John Mills or Michael Redgrave , and cold blood in his acting. He was altogether with James Dean , John Casvettes , Montgomery Clift , Dennis Hopper and Sal Mineo the pioneers , the new beat , the avant garde current of the cold war generation.This film was a special triumph for Lee Marvin too, another hard guy who would make his own bliss in antihero roles. (Dirty dozen)In this movie the term Beatles is seen in a special sequence . Try to find it.This film was clearly a visionary issue , thirteen years before Easy Rider for instance.Marlon Brando : in memoriam!"
5,The Wild One VCR,This is a used Videocassette that looks and plays like new. It was delivered promptly. 5 stars to the seller.My favorie scene is the bar scene where Danny Welton plays Rebop on the harmonica.
4,Good movie,I thought this movie was pretty entertaining considering its age. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to stay awake through it but it's not one of those movies. It moves fast and its not long. I recommend to anyone going through a classic movie phase.
2,The Tame One,"All those reviewers who gave this film 5 and 4 stars are really digging deep into their charity boxes. This is an incredibly dated, slow and boring movie. It is only memorable because of the Brando iconography: after you've seen the publicity stills you've seen the whole thing. Except for Lee Marvin, who, as somebody said, had dynamic and mesmeric impact in every film he ever made --- possibly excepting Paint Your Wagon. As soon as he arrives on the scene the picture starts to come alive. But to sit taking in nothing but an ancient fashion image for the rest of the 76 minutes is asking too much. The characters are completely uninteresting on both sides of the social divide: you might call them dull and duller. Vacuous dialogue vacantly directed. Don't be misled by the kind-hearted comments you read from people leaning over backwards to be generous."
3,brando before he got fat and untalented.,"The entire time length that takes place in this movie is like less than one day. Brando and his Black Rebel Motorcycle Club cronies spend the day being retarded in some bar in some town. The only reason I could think to watch this movie is so you could see that at one point, in a galaxy far far away, Marlon Brando was a cool dude. Before arrogance seeped out of his body like sweat, he was a guy you'd want to see in a movie. Now, obviously, he's dead and like most actors who were in old movies, has been elevated to 'legend' status, despite only being in a handful of good movies. This movie was released in 1954, and I know I've become a bit jaded by Pulp Fiction and anime, but as far as I'm concerned, 1950's B&W movie or not, its not very good. The begining, end, acting, story, etc., just isn't that great, and it's really nothing more than a cult film about motorcycles."
4,46 years later...,"I look at this film today through very different eyes than when I first saw it as a high-schooler in '54.Of course a lot of it seems hokey now, and with good reason: the world is a far less innocent place than it was in those bucolic, Eisenhower, pre-R&R days.But when it first came out, it was Hot Stuff. Bad guys, noisy bikes, beer-drinking, and girls in tight sweaters were a big deal to us then."
3,He was a sweet beautiful guy,"To think that this film was banned in England for 20 years makes one cringe in disbelief - one of Woody Allen's characters is right when he intones that all the things we were told as children that were good for us turned out bad - milk, meat, sun, big cars- and all the the things that we were told were bad for us turned out good - leather jackets, motor cycles, bebop, nature. But to The Wild One. Yes it's dated. The jive language doesn't fit with white middle class men dressed up in leather jackets, and Mr Brando is much to sweet, self conscious, and beautiful to be considered wild. Men and women alike are rushing to if not hug and kiss him, just look. He's caged for similar reasons. The arty camerawork on the bike ride at night with girl on the back doesn't quite work, but it's not a bad movie. The main attraction is really the beauty of Mr Brando. The first shot of the bikes heading towards us down the country road is a memorable opening."
3,Saved (somewhat) only by Brando,"The Bottom Line:Rebel without a Cause on motorcycles (though it admittedly came first), The Wild One is a fairly generic and dull biker movie which probably wouldn't even be on DVD if it wasn't lucky enough to star Marlon Brando; basically the only reasons you should ever watch this uninteresting film are if you're writing a paper on 1950s culture or if you're incredibly interested in Brando.2.5/4"
2,not all that good,After reading the back cover I thought this soundd like a good read. I'm a fan of Clive Cussler and this sounded like it as in the same vein. After the first 30 pages I realized that this guy can't write anything that comes close to Clive Cussler. I like my novels long and heavy on detail in both the history and the action. This deliverd on neither. The Historical backgourd for the prologue and within the body of the story itself pales in comparison to Cussler. The action sequences were not all that well written either and the dialogue felt stiff and forced. I may borrow another one of Higgins' novels from my Grandfather-in-law who gave me this one and give him another chance but I'm not going to hold my breath.If you are a fan of Cussler I strongly recommend skipping this book. If you are looking for a fast read without a whole lot of background to get bogged down in then this is for you.
4,Very Good,Higgins has a way of jaming all the real action into the last couple of chapters but for some reason when nothing is happening he keeps you reading. This book is also like that. The relationships in this book are interesting and they provide more insight in to the charecters. I really enjoyed reading and look forward to my next reading of a Higgins book.
3,A Sean Dillon novel,"After the prologue sets the background of the Chungking Covenant, the story jumps forward 50 years and digresses for the first two chapters in an unrelated case involving Sean Dillon. Chapter three goes back to the Chungking Covenant, and Dillon is brought into the case somewhat belatedly. It is an interesting case, but both the good guys and the bad guys bumble about a bit too much in circumstances where one slip could mean sudden death (dropping their guard, turning their back on a known enemy, etc.). Some scenarios are repeated in other Sean Dillon tales.Unlike James Bond, Dillon never seems to have much luck with women. The story has considerable violence but very little sex. Overall, the book is worth reading for light fiction, especially if you are a Sean Dillon fan. The action is fast paced, and never gets dull."
1,Trucker-Love the Semi-hate the movie.,"What a drag of a movie,you have an irresponsible woman who apparently is dubbed ""Independent"" because she is an independent Trucker.(I Love The International Truck and Love TruckerGenre Films but..)She is a selfish woman Who walked out on a Child she gave birth to,Is into One-night stands and drinks.The total opposite of Independence more like Immoral or Amoral,Total Nihilist and that turns me away.The kid of course comes out to be a spoiled and undisciplined banshee of a child and Therefore is as annoying as The Mother,I couldn't wait for this Malaise of a Movie to be over."
2,"Shameless Copy Of ""The Burning Plain""","Their opening sex scenes, hospital scenes, and abandonments are virtually identical. Even if I hadn't seen ""Burning Plain"" this script keeps the main character far too mysterious. When a mom leaves a baby, there has to be reasons way deeper than ""I am the way I am."" She's much too intelligent not to have have more self awareness than that."
4,NO PANTS NO SERVICE,"Diane Ford (Michelle Monaghan) is a female trucker. Like her male counterparts she gets paid by the mile, drinks, stays at cheap motels, has a tat, and pays for sex. Unlike her male counterparts she doesn't have spinal damage from being on the road or manages to secure a load for the return trip. When her ex-husband (Benjamin Bratt) gets ""the big C"" her 11 year old estranged son (Jimmy Bennett) is dumped on her doorstep....LET THE BONDING BEGIN!Anyone who has ever watched a movie knows that the son is going to start out being rebellious and trouble and eventually they will bond. Diane has a friend Runner (Nathan Fillion) who helps her along the way and wants to take their friendship of 4 years to the next level. Add some lame music, a few gut wrenching tense moments, a couple of heart warming tear-jerker scenes and you have the formula for a successful indie.F-bomb, sex, no nudity, attempted rape. 3 1/2 stars"
4,Best of,"Nice cd by bruce becvar. The disc obtains a best of overvieuw of his best period in his career so far. When a musician decides to chose a different path in his career it should be his choice, I think this kind of music sounds best when it remains simple without any complicated instruments added. I love the opening track, by faraway his best title. If you do not own any music by bruce becvar...this one is a good choice."
2,Not Durable,"Bought this floor lamp several years ago. Can't say it was used very much but it's nice to have light where you need it when reading. Well my kittens knocked it over and the bulb got lost. Referenced the materials sent with the purchased product and got a 3 pack of replacement bulbs. First bulb blew out immediately so we unplugged the light, replaced the bulb and plugged it back in. Second one also blew out when it was plugged back in. Hunk of junk! This light is not inexpensive so you'd think it would hold up better."
1,VERY BAD buy,"If you have an ounce of common sense, you will find this book useless. It is very superficial in all areas. Author's advice is a joke - you already KNOW everything mentioned. Book is an advertisement for Lladro dealers - dealers mentioned throughout the book. VERY BAD buy. AVOID. If you need a Lladro book, go with one written by Lladro."
1,Not worth it!,This book is definitely not worth the money. You can find the exact same information and MUCH MORE for FREE on the web. Definitely a disappointment!
5,Very happy arrived quickly,"The book was exatly what I was looking for, a very no hassel transaction which makes it a real pleasure. We have found Amazon to be a very honest company. Nothing else to say. Cheers Chris"
5,A Fantastic Resource!,"For anyone who is interested in learning more about Lladró, the company, the history, the incredible artistry, ""relatives"" such as NAO and Zaphir, collecting and becoming better at collecting, and how to care for your collection, this book is fantastic and I highly recommend it! Peggy Whiteneck is truly an expert in this field, and has a passion for collecting Lladró that shows in every page. This second edition includes updates and new information as well as even more photos. Lladró collectors will not want to miss this!"
5,Collecting Lladro,"Peggy Whiteneck is a respected authority on Lladro. She reorganized and totally updated the Lladro listings in Collector's Mart's Price Guide to Limited Edition Collectibles and has been a constant contributor to it for four years. She's also had feature articles on Lladro and Nao published in Collector's Mart magazine. Her new book, Collecting Lladro: Identification and Price Guide, is one of the best Lladro resources I've used to date, with information and photographs available in no other resource. It's one of the first books I turn to with questions regarding Lladro."
2,incomplete coverage,i was/am looking for an indepth price and value guide. this book is pretty but not complete at all. i reccommend the Official Lladro Collection Identification Catalog and Price Guide by Dr. Glenn Johnson for serious collectors. If you can find it! Try Baron Rolen Jewelers in Stone Mtn. Ga.
5,This CD is killer.,"Hey, it's nice to find a forum where someone reviewed this CD before i did! Cool! Anyway, this is a great disc. The lyrics are very socially aware, which is sort of a rare thing in this age of endless murder, porn and gore inspired Death / Grind. I've read derogatory reviews about INNER THOUGHT's drum programming, but personally i think it's excellent; it sounds human because it isn't ultra fast, but at the same time it's also mechanical and cold. Add to that the typical Death growls and roars, occasional keyboard work, some lovely female vocals { Yeah, you read that right: female vocals } and a cool production and you have 'Worldly Separation'! Oh, and if you think the cover artwork is gruesome, wait until you see what's inside... this album is more than recommended."
4,Great starter unit for home HD use-Sony VPL-ES2,"I bought this unit not really knowing what to expect.The first thing I did was to buy a 95""screen(Da-lite) next a DVD player(Samsung) that doubles the lines to 1080 and then a HDTV tuner(LG). This little unit is fantastic for watching PBS Nature programs in HD and it does well with movies too. I had to darken the window light in order to get optimal effect. The sound comes from a set of Altec Lansing 5.1 computer speakers w/ sub woofer.I have installed and set-up projection systems as part of my job and I think this system does a great job,as I have it. I bought a HD Camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1) and it looks very pro on this system!Final Note: Finally a hobbiest can now capture,edit,project video,and audio in a truly professional manner. I've played with video since the early 1970's, starting with the Sony Portapak, and now I've realized a dream, started so many years ago.Thank You very very much...Sony"
3,Underwhelming Overall,"I was a disappointed by this book. Most of the reproductions lack luster and most of them are too small. To make matters worst, probably a third to half of the images are in black and white. What is the point of putting out a book on Sargent when we the readers can't enjoy his color palette? I can understand reproducing sketches in black and white, but to have finished paintings reproduced in black and white is totally absurd."
3,okay,"This book chronicles the lives of the Schaeffers from Edith's point of view. It centers around their work in Switzerland, but does not include their return to the U.S. While there is interesting insight into the ""everyday life"" of running L'Abri, there is very little discussion of Francis Schaeffer's philosophy."
4,the golden age of music,this CD is pretty good the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of fabian lets face it the man had know talent his good looks got him thourgh it all but Valens and Avalon save the CD...
3,an okay book,"Although this book was not as interesting as many of Cronin's other books(The Citadel, The Green Years, etc.), it was pretty good. It tells the story of a doctor accused of malpractice who went on a cruise in the canary islands to calm down and escape publicity. On the boat, he meets the young, beautiful, Mary Fielding, and they obviously fall in love. He is later given a chance to save her life and be the wonderful doctor he always was. The plot is rather boring and predicatable, but the characterization is excellent. All the people he meets on the boat are very interesting and that is the strong point of the book. I recomend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Cronin's other book, but don't expect anything too wonderful."
1,unexpected,"Anyone looking for the theatrical version needs to look elsewhere. There is so much different with this movie that it should have a different title. Yes it has Mel Gibson in it and he lost his half of the money, and that's it. The music, the inner monologue, even the outfit boss; all different. Maybe some will like it, but I can see why the movie studio did not let this director keep directing."
1,Not good.,I LOVE Payback... the theatrical release. One of the scenes that stand out the most to me - is when Mel gets his toes crushed by a sledge hammer. This version... does not have that. In fact there are a couple people that he kills in the theatrical version - that dont die in this one. This version was a disappoinment to say the least.
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!! What were They Thinking?,"They destroyed a great movie with a horrible ending. They could have at least included both endings. ""The Real"" movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. Now, I am really regreting purchasing this movie. I really want to stress to everyone that they completely ruined the movie. I almost took the disc out and broke it after I watched it thats how horribly disgusted I was after watching this piece of trash. They should be ashamed of themselves for destroying an awesome movie."
4,But is it Parker ?,"Please can someone who has read (and loves) the Parker novels make some comments on this film ? I cannot imagine Gibson being any good as Parker, but I (and I'm sure many other Richard Stark fans) would appreciate a review by someone know knows the books.After all, 'Point Blank', 'Slayground', 'The Outfit' and 'Made In USA' all failed to capture the character, so I don't hold out much hope, but would like some informed comment here."
1,Tom Keogh is an idiot,"Please do not believe a single word of the official review above. There is a good reason that they took the movie away and changed it - this version is awful. I was a huge fan of the original, which was an excellent neo-noir that had edges both in the noir-ish violence and the great dark humor. It was a dark, funny, generally awesome movie. This version takes out the great music, and somehow makes all the characters just feel less lively. The whole thing drags. If there is any justice in the world, they will re release the original theater cut."
1,If I could give it no stars I would!,"This is quite frankly one of the worst movies ever. The plot is almost non-existent, the characters are completely unbelievable, and the setting is so dark and gloomy you have to wonder why no-one turned the lights on!Though I am usually a Mel Gibson fan this has to rank as his worst movie to date! Avoid it at all costs!"
3,Average action flick... nothing more,"1. This is an average action type movie, however falls short due to... overly dramatized acting? I can't quite put my finger on it, but the overall premise, the acting--> it's just a little too phony vs over the top.2. Anyway, I know it's a movie--> ie fantasy and thus it's not bad for pure entertainment, but nothing more."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"A few friends had told me that Payback was mediocre at best, but I was blown away when I saw it. A great crime and revenge film, with Mel Gibson perfect in an atypical role. Great supporting characters (most with a Pulp Fiction edge), and I could look at Maria Bello all day. And check out the film's appropriately dreary mood -- you can count on one hand the number of times you see colors other than monochromatic blues and grays (excepting of course the blood and explosions!)."
4,Great action film,"I have always been a fan of Mel Gibson, from the early days of (Road Warrior). So I might be a little biased in my review of his films.Porter (Mel Gibson), has been double-crossed by his partner, after they steal $130,000 from the Chineese mob. Porter wants his part, this movie is about him getting even.You will find yourself cheering for Porter, not because he is a good guy, (there aren't any in this movie), but because he is the best of the bad guys. This is fun, if you call a high body count fun. There is subtle humor through out this film, albeit in places it is dark. Still this is worth a look."
1,Not the release version you want,"This version ONLY contains the director's cut. Do yourself a favor and find the other Blu-ray release which contains BOTH the theatrical and director's cuts. (Don't be afraid of the European release. It's region free and the NTSC/PAL problem doesn't exist on Blu-ray) They are much different cuts.Personally, I prefer the theatrical cut because it has more of a sense of humor and a cleverness about it. In comparison, the director's cut is not darker but is instead dulled and dour. The ending is anti-climactic without being any edgier than the theatrical version. I also prefer the opening, the look and the score of the theatrical version.**The one bit I did enjoy from director's cut was a quick bit at 1:18:20-- which wouldn't fit into the theatrical version because at that point the plotline has diverged from the original."
1,Not the version you will want to see,"Loved the first version, although ""Porter"" was a criminal, you were able to care for the character, and wanted things to turn out right for him. In this ""uncut"" version, you could care less for Porter, as he beats his drug-addicted wife, and is generally a character with no redeeming aspects. I hated this version, and after watching it, it only left me wishing for the other. If you enjoyed the first, especially the character of Porter, I doubt that you will enjoy this version at all. Wish I would have never bought it."
1,Watch the theatrical release instead,Warning: Spoiler alert. I was not impressed with the rework of this movie. And the fact that it doesn't include the original theatrical release made me even less impressed. They lose the voiceover in this version and simplify the plot. Kris Kristofferson's character is completely eliminated and the kidnapping of his son is gone as a result. The end of the movie is simple: Meet the bad guys and kill them for the money. Any of the cleverness of Mel Gibson's character is gone and all that's left is his brutality. Forget this version and watch the original.
3,Payback,"Directors Beware! On most occasions studios step in and destroy the Director's vision. This is a rare occasion when the big bad studio got it right. Brian Helgeland's cut is interesting and enjoyable, but it remains a pale shadow of the original release. The studio's recasting of the villian from female to a male was a masterstroke as Kris Kristofferson was one of the highlights of the original release. This Blu Ray Director's Cut eliminates my two favourite scenes - 'Happy Birthday' and 'Another Wrong Number'. Completely forgiveable if the original studio release was including in the Blu Ray 'Director's Cut' DVD. So, what do I have? A prettier, inferior version."
1,"If you liked the orignal, you'll hate this. At least I did.","I saw the original theatrical release at the theater and liked it so much, I bought another ticket. There was a dark comedic thing going on, but the bad guy wasn't a dirtbag. There was a degree of chivalry and honor. In this version, I hate the bad guy. He is just a thug who beats the crap out of his wife. Ok, she deserved it to a point, but the original Porter loved her despite her drug addiction and forgave her for the most part. The music in this new version SUCKS! The original was lively and enthralling. In this version the music is an afterthought and gets in the way. This new version is a completely different movie, a sucky one. I hope to heck that they release the original version to blu ray, and quite honestly I was very suprised that both versions weren't on the CD. What a waste of money. If you like the original, don't bother with this trash."
3,"Interesting, but...","It's certainly interesting watching this version. I have to admit, I liked the theatrical version better, but this was still a good watch."
2,The original was better,"Having owned and lost the DVD version of the original, I replaced it with the ""Director's Cut"" and was disappointed. Apparently I don't know a good movie when I see one, because I thought the original was head and shoulders better. In fact, I've just ordered the original to replace the ""Director's Cut"". The original held my attention from beginning to end, while the director's cut allowed a few trips to the kitchen while the plot thickened. The new ending was a disappointment and didn't give the same closure as the original. Viva la Original!"
5,Original Way Better!,"the only Blu-ray release of the theatrical version is on the Import,with the directors cut.the original has Kris kristofferson's part along with his son who gets taken as part of Mel's plan to get his money.Mel's narration and Kristofferson's part are removed in the directors cut and i ask why!the movie is so much better with kristofferson as a heavy bad guy.the Blu-ray import has both versions,choose for yourself."
1,Payback,This movie is not even close to the first. I was extremely disappointed. I wish I would not have wasted the money.
1,Dreary and depressing,"This movie is dreary and depressing, with no redeeming features, other than the small role played by James Coburn. The action is improbable and the plot is idiotic, and I am a big fan of good action movies."
4,enjoy the movie,wanted to have this movie in my collection. so made my order on Saturday and it came in four days later. dvd works not problems. this movie was about pride.
2,Payback - not usual ending.....,"I am very disappointed in this movie. It is not the standard ending that I have viewed in other distributions. It really cuts the story short and was a great let-down. If you have not seen the movie, you probably won't notice, but if you have, be aware of this...."
2,OK,"I wasn't that impressed with this film. I guess it's just a ""guy"" film and a little too coarse for my taste."
1,Snoozefest,The movie was really disappointing. Slow to start. Bizarre dialogue sapped my attention. Dumb plot line. I turned if off after 35 minutes. There are so many better movies out there.
1,Not as good as the theatrical release,"For anyone who has seen the theatrical release of this movie, I expect this would be a real let-down. There were a lot of disappointing differences in this director's cut. The audio has changed. The gray filter on the visuals is gone. Porter's film noir voice-over is gone. The ""third act"" is completely different. The dog doesn't live. Those were all things I loved about the theatrical version. The original ending is very weak. I feel sorry that Helgeland's art originally got hijacked so execs could make more money off of it, but at the same time, I'm happy that it was made into a better movie for it. !!SPOILER !! SPOILER !! Helgeland's third act makes no sense at all anyway. Why would you send ten or so people to kill Porter where he asks for the money to be sent if you were going to give him the money? Why would you send the money if you were going to have him killed? Does that make any sense at all?"
1,A Stinker,"I love Mel Gibson films and I usually love shoot-em-up adventures, but this one fails miserably. While there is plenty of action, there is no discernable plotline and the violence has no purpose beyond a vehicle for Mel Gibson on a rampage and a job for the special effects guys. There are very few films I have ever truely disliked, but my husband and I were in seperate theaters, and we both walked out on it and demanded a refund."
1,"Boy, does this stink!","Seldom does a movie have such gratititous violence, offensive portrayals of virtually every stereostype you can think of, and absolutely no dramatic tension. The only other movie that I've seen that has ever come close to being this horrible is BAD LIEUTENANT. The all-star cast (male, of course) should have their heads examined for being in such a loser picture."
1,Don't waste your money,"This film is so boring, that you will fall asleep after latest 30 minutes. There is less action, a stupide story, bad talking. The most used word in this film is f**k! This is the worst movie I have seen up to now from Mel Gibson."
1,An absolute stinker!,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Dreary setting; all the characters are crooks, hookers, and/or junkies; most of the dialogue is foul language; Gibson beats someone up, gets beat up, or shoots someone in virtually every scene. Only the scriptwriter knows the body count for this ugly, trashy movie."
2,not a total bore,"it wasnt that much of a bore but this movie quickly drops with its nagging supportees and their dumb dialouge. but Gibson is great and looks like hes having a good time killing off these people then you'd think. the highlight is when Gibson visits James Coburn at his place and makes the bagcarries hold up the suitcases and then he shoots them, Coburn flips out and its great. some good action scenes, but Gregg Henry sorta puts the kick in kicked in the head, though I was greatful Gibson shot him in the head."
3,"THIS DIRECTOR SHOULD GET ""CUT"", THAT'S MY PAYBACK FOR THIS ONE!","I GET IT. BECAUSE NOT TO MANY PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST ONE, THEY DECIDED TO RE-EDIT FROM THE ""DIRECTORS"" POINT OF VIEW. HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIS VIEWS TO HIMSELF. THE ORIGINAL ONE, THE FIRST RELEASE IS FAR BETTER. THIS ONE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE PUNCH OR THE KICK THAT THE FIRST ONE HAS. MAYBE THE DIRECTOR SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED SOME SCENES FROM THE , DIRECTOR'S CUT, AND ADDED IT TO THE FIRST RELEASE THEN IT REALLY WOULD'VE BEEN A MAJOR ""PAYBACK"". I SAY, RENT IT FIRST BEFORE PURCHASING FOR YOUR COLLECTION. YOU DECIDE WHAT'S WHAT IN THIS CHANGE OF DIRECTION!"
2,Straight Up Directors cut takes a good film Straight DOWN,"The original theatrical version of this move was (and still is) in my personal top 25. All I can say about the director's cut is that Brian Helgeland couldn't have screwed it up more if he intentionally tried (and I'm not so sure that he didn't).The first two thirds of the movie are more or less the same and the character development is adequate. But he totally destroyed what was a clever and entertaining ending and replaced it with short-cut tripe. For anyone who has not seen this movie yet, I strongly recommend the original theatrical version. It occurs to me that this version may be nothing more than an attempt to make more money from the same film, but they could have done that anyway by relasing the original on Blu-ray. I would have bought it, I won't now. Now that I have already purchase this garbage!"
2,Don't waste your money on the Directors's Cut,"I greatly enjoyed the theatrical version of Payback. After watching the Director's Cut of Payback, I can see why major changes were made in the final release. Don't waste your money purchasing the Director's Cut."
3,Great Friday night movie,"Mel Gibson gives cool performance in this movie. He is not a nice guy, but after all he is living on a borrowed life and has nothing to loose. If there ever was a guy who can make enemies with everyone, Porter (Gibson's character) is the guy. He is slowly taking all of his enemies down in order to collect the money that belongs to him. Considering we are only talking about $70K it is an amazing effort on his behalf. His enemies die one by one and you have to be really naive not to expect this kind of movie not to have a happy ending.Entertaining and funny, full of action. I enjoyed this film very much."
4,Mel,"Good story, great acting. I like Mel Gibson. Think about all of the great movies he has made. Good solid movie about Payback........."
2,original better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"C'mon, the original movie was much better, i love kris kristofersens role in the movie, his arrogance, egotism and and ruggid approach seemed to capture the audience. I wanst crazy about the ending, the dvd should of had both versions on this, not just the directors cut.Although some of the new scenes did me in such as porter hitting his wife for the crimes that she did against him."
1,Not the original movie,"The original 1999 movie has been destroyed for this ""directors cut"" and they didnt even have the decency to include the original theatrical release in the same package. A complete rip off.The original movie is great but you will only find it on dvd, not blu ray."
2,"'The So called Director's cut""",I saw this movie in the theater;loved it and bought the dvd when it was released.And I thought Porter hitting the Taxi Stand Clerk with a coffee mug was for some reason cut from the dvd(I remember this scene from the cinema or was I imagining the Clerk getting mugged?)So when they released the 'Director's Cut' I rushed out and bought it.What a waste of money.I watch the original dvd every now and then but the director's cut only once so far and that will be it.It has been chopped and changed so much that it's not worth the effort.I hope they release the Original in BLU RAY soon.Can anyone shed some light on the taxi stand scene? Thanks
2,This Version Is Not Good,"They destroyed the 1999 version, which is much better. I but director's cut thinking that I would get more, but I got less, it is like 11 minutes of less movies and change characters and removed interesting scenes."
1,Terrible,"My wife bought this for me for x-mas as a replacement dvd for the original vhs version thinking that it was the same movie with the usual couple of cutting room floor scenes added--WRONG! A totally different movie. Missing is the great voiceover by Mel, the dark humour of the original script replaced and from about the halfway point on a completely different plot. It ends up being what goes in Hollywood today for an action movie, that is, blood-letting and killing with a terrible script, lousy dialogue and cardboard characters. The original taut little gem of a movie ends up being a bloated mess. If I could give it zero stars I would. Do yourself a favor and stick with the original production."
5,Paybacks a B!#@h,This film is amazing on Blu-ray. To bad it wont be there for long. Shame on you Paramount.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,I have the orginal Payback DVD and now just saw the Director's Cut version. I was so very disappointed by the Director's Cut. The ending of the DC did not measure up at all to the orginal version with Kris K. They should have left well enough alone.
2,Why Root For This Worthless Anti-hero?,"We are supposedly supposed to cheer on a guy who will do anything to get back $70,000 that was stolen from him. But he stole the money in the first place; it's not his. Gibson play the role of a total sociopath who thinks nothing of stealing from or killing anyone. This man has no socially redeeming value yet we are supposed to identify with him. Hollywood has gone a bit too far with this one.The action can be fun at times, but most of the goings on are really quite ridiculous.The only reason to watch the movie is to ogle Lucy Liu (from the Ally McBeal TV series) who plays an S&M prostitute."
1,I`m glad I didn`t pay to watch this,"A typical, by-the-numbers, emotionless action movie like so many others. Mel Gibson plays a tough guy (surprise!) that fights the real bad guys. Well, that`s about it... The beginning of the story is appealing, given that the direction is actually good and creates a tense mood with a dark blue ambience, a crime noir feel. Unfortunately, that`s the only good aspect of this picture, since the plot is flat and the characters one-dimensional.Another boring blockbuster."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,"IF YOUR A FAN OF HD AND A FAN OF THE ORINGAL VERSION THEN DON`T GET THIS.sOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT I`M ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT.IN THE FIRST VERSION THE FILM HAD A TINT OF BLUE,TO GIVE IT A MORE DEEPER FEELING.I WENT OUT BUYING THIS ONE,THINKING O THIS WILL BE GREAT TO SEE THIS ON HD..TO MY SUPERSIE THEY COMPETLEY CUT THAT OUT...SO DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE...."
5,Straight up outstanding!,"This is almost a completely different film from the theatrical release (which I thoroughly enjoyed) Gone is the voice over and in it's place is an implied narrative that needs no explanation. Porter is a bad man. But he has principles. And he has no problem whatsoever in following those principles with an almost single-minded focus. The last act has none of the elements of the theatrical release. Which to me, is a vast improvement. Honestly, the version I saw in the theaters just seemed a little too... Martin Riggs. Which is not bad, but when it's supposed to be a completely different character in a completely different universe, it just doesn't seem right. Especially after watching the Director's Cut. I highly recommend watching both and making up your own mind."
1,Senseless and worthless,"Typical of Gibson's bullet flying, explosion everywhere kind of movie. One just copy the others. Looking back to the whole movie, you can't stop thinking: what are the points? No one will see this if it is not for Gibson."
1,WHAT THE HELL?!!!,This isn't even the same damn movie. I don't know what jackass got his hands on this movie for the remake but he shouldn't be allowed to work on ANYTHING again EVER. Completely ruined one of my favorite movies of all time.
2,What was wrong with the first cut?,SO GLAD that I rented this instead of buying it. This cut of the film is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the theatrical release... even going so far as to change the gender of the head of the syndicate. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT in some pivotal places. Starts soft. Ends soft. NO NARRATION. Weird. Did this filmmaker get brainwashed by Syd Field after releasing the first cut?I'm not against change. Peter Jackson scored BIG with the new cuts of all of his films. But this just seems to have been done from boredom.BAD FILM in it's Blu-Ray form.See the SD version. It's one worth owning.I only gave this two stars because the blu-ray transfer was nice.
4,Film Noir With a Twist,"Lot's of action. Everybody has an evil side in this movie. A little violent and times, but great fun overall. This is film noir with a touch of comedy."
4,A Principled Man.,"'Payback' comes as close as Hollywood dare to depicting life on the street for the professional crook. Mel Gibson is a superlative tough guy character actor without a capable film industry. With an extra 20lb and aged ten years he would have made a great DeNero alternative in 'Heat' and 'Ronin'. The movie captures the feeling of the NYC urban decay of the seventies, through music, script and prop, but continuity robs the film of it's credibility (catch the Chrysler Neon cruising by). A good action film, a story well told by hard men, bigtown hustle made art, the pathos of life in the 'business', a fight to maintain some kind of personal principle in a sewer of deceit. There are many stories in this film. Worth watching."
3,"Not Bad, But A Bit Confusing.","This movie wasn't too bad really. It was a bit confusing near the beginning though, but on the whole Payback is worth a viewing. Mel Gibson did a good job in his role. The plot was okay, but really not that interesting. Not a movie I would probably want to see again, but it's worth watching once at least."
2,zzzzzzzzz,"well whats up with the blue light through the whole movie? ok, i thought mel was supposed to be the ""bad guy"", he seems more of a anti-hero than bad guy. this movie is really boring, i was expecting mel to be a evil mo fo going around getting even, well thats what it is but mel is just not evil and kills only if shot at, what a wuss. and he has a stupid girlfriend i don't care about, some bad guy. the movie is slow and boring considering mel is not the ""bad guy"" he was advertised to be and when it finally picks up and gets violent it ends."
1,Not as good as the real version,"For those who enjoy the movie Payback in its original form, this movie is a huge disappointment. Gone are the wisecrack remarks from Mel Gibson and jokes from Lucy Lu. The original movie did a good job of portraying porter as the good guy. This movie shows his dark side. For those who enjoyed Gibson's movies in the genre including Conspiracy Theory, you will wonder why they ever made this directors cut."
3,Good. Not as good as RANSOME...but...,"I watched this one five years ago and the truth is I did not like that much. RANSOM is a very suspenseful film. Like I do with all my movie reviews, I'm not gonna tell you the plot or what's it about, but I can tell you this:If you like those kind of movies in which revenge is involved, than I think this one's for you. I don't like most of those revenge movies like THE PUNISHER. But, overall it was pretty good and suspenseful."
2,Senseless plot and violence,"""getting back to someone"" pretty much sums up the whole movie. Nothing much else. Although I like many of Mel Gibson's movies, this one was let down by senseless violence and plot. His acting is fine, but the plot is very shallow and does not make any logical sense beside getting ""payback"". Another one time rental."
1,this is one of the worst movies that I have seen.,"Killing people for just $70,000.00 is ridiculous and did you see those old car cellular phones."
1,Studio Cut Better Version,"I consider Payback to be one of my ""desert island"" movies, but the Director's Cut doesn't make that list. The director watered down the movie's character and stripped away some of the artistic stylization by making that cuts that he did. This is an inferior piece of work."
3,Mehback,"I just viewed this at a friends house and while the movie starts strong it ends weak. The real problem is a lack of strict motivation on the part of the ""hero"". As a viewer I didn't care if he got his money back (because it wasn't HIS to begin with) and he didn't care that his wife died after the first 40 minutes, so what we are left with are vanilla villians and not much icing. I thought the picture looked sharp at times but certain scenes contained excessive grain; the sound was often at odds with what the viewer was seeing; and in general the movie didn't seem to have a relevent conclusion.This could have been a fun 3/5 rental but as it turned out it ended up being a purchase by a friend and a warning flag for me to choose my HD and Bluray selections cautiously."
1,Want my Money Back,My husband bought this movie without realizing that this movie would be compeltely different than the theatrical version. We are extremely dissapointed and feel we were ripped off. It would have been nice if they could have at least put both versions on the disc.
4,"Cool, calm, collected.","Mel Gibson goes back to his Lethal Weapon roots for this one--without the badge.So he's the bad guy, but we'd root for Mel in any role, and this is no different. He's emotional without being sappy, cool without being fake. This is a movie to watch for the performance.The plot seems like it ought to ruin the movie, but it's simple enough to be fun and acceptable. Some great supporting work from Lucy Liu and Kris Kristopherson as well.This is a film that will hold an important place in my collection--I'll go to Payback when I want to watch a ""movie"". It provides laughs, action and great performances. An all-around good flick."
2,The original version hit theatres for a reason,"While the editorial review on this film certainly argues the point that this version is less mainstream, it would only make one wonder why any review has to argue anything to get you to watch the movie.This version is a very straight forward and realistic take on what would have happened in the film for sure, but personally I found it to be considerably less entertaining to watch. To be fair I personally like more main stream movies, and I would say that anyone that enjoyed the original version of the film as much as I did probably won't like the changes made in this.While this is my personal opinion I would at least treat it as a warning to the ""average"" movie watcher that you're probably better off with the original version."
2,Disappointment,"My husband and I were both completely disappointed by this product. To begin with, we did not enjoy the director's cut version. I understand this is what the director had in mind, but I found this version to be a flat story without any climax - it wound around but didn't have the finishing touches of the theatrical version. I know not every movie is meant to entertain, but I just liked the theatrical version better. That being said, I would have preferred if the disc had both versions, so you could watch the one you liked better, or at least compare the two. Many films do this, but it is frustrating that some do not. Now the director's cut is the only one you can find. Whenever a movie is released as a director's cut, I think it should have the original as well. That it didn't was a serious lack, especially because we felt cheated by the new version. My opinion."
4,Lesson Learned.....Hopefully.,"Let this be a lesson to movie production companies everywhere: Do not interfere with the directors original vision. When I saw the original theatrical release of Payback, I thought it was a pretty good movie, 3 star quality, but it wasn't really anything new. After I found out that the original movie had been altered without the directors involvement and I watched the director's cut the story gelled better and it became much more coherent and wonderful movie to watch. This is definately a much better version (or should I say TRUE version) of the film that is definately worth watching. It's not as comedic, but that fits the tone better and makes the violence seem more real rather than just poking fun at people's deaths. I'm glad the director got to see his original vision represented and I hope he, and all directors, are allowed to make movies without The Suits interfereing from now on."
4,Maybe 4 1/2 is more accurate,Haven't seen the theatrical release but really liked this version and I'll always support the writer's vision over that of the studio hacks. I think what appeared to be lost has been found again. Cheers!
4,Decent Flick,"Classic Gibson masochism. He ""suffers"" while all the people around him also pay the price. That said, minus the love story this is an ok version of _The Hunter_"
3,Payback Instant Watch is Original version,"I just watched both versions of this film back to back. Honestly I liked both version. The director's cut added and removed scenes and changed the ending. Also the commentary was removed from the directors cut. At the end of day I liked some things better in each version.However, to my main point. Reading the reviews I couldn't tell which version the instant watch was. I guess amazon is using the reviews for the dvd and instant watch and the dvd version is actually director cut instead of the original. I have no idea if that problem has been fixed but the instant watch version is indeed the original. I watched the director cut version on netflix which was mistakenly attached to the original version info page. The reviews there are just as screwed up as they are here with people complaining they got the wrong version.I say do yourself a favor and watch both versions."
4,Typical action/adventure movie?,"I say no, it was high paced, action with origonal ideas, and catchy foreshadowing. I did not like the overuse of Mel Gibson being tortured, I thought that it was good for every movie he was in, but come on! Why does this guy deserve to be tortured in all his movies. Poor fella."
2,Not really worth the payout,"Straightforward revenge plot with Lucy Liu as eye candy and many rather unbelievable plot twists. Good as cheap action Flicks go, but Mel Gibson could have gotten better scripts along the same lines. He does well with what he had just he didn't have a whole lot to work with. Something to take teenagers to that want to see explosions but that is about it."
3,"Mel Gibson's ""Blue Period"".","Depression is in the air! The look to this film is what I really enjoyed. It uses it's color schemes brilliantly. Very artsy fartsy but very very subtle and cool. I think the cinematography should at least be nominated for an oscar.The real problem I have with Payback is the hum drum plot full of cliche after cliche, and the typicality of the male driven ego type of character Mel always seems to play. I do, however like some of the dialogue in this film, derived straight out of some old classic crime movie of the 40's or 50's. At times if you squint at the screen, you may swear your watching an old balck and white crime classic.There are too many dry spots in this film though, and some of the bantering between all the crimelords is a bit confusing and just plain dull. I loved the character played by ""Ling"" (of Alley Mc Beal fame). She plays a scary dominatrix with flare and conviction! Crack that whip girl! Ouch!"
3,The Alternate Version,"On its own, it is not a bad movie, but it is misleading to call it ""Payback"" when it is essentially a different film."
4,One word; -Brilliant!-,"This is a brillant, and different action movie. Mel Gibson's usual outstanding performance shows very well in this dark and partially frightning movie. I recommend it for everybody who likes good movies."
3,Not at all what I've grown to expect from Mel Gibson.,"This movie was more of a disappointment than an enjoyment. I truly enjoy almost everything Mel Gibson has ever made, but this movie never really developed enough to draw me in. Besides, I hate to see him playing a ""semi-bad-guy"". You'll still end up rooting for him, but it doesn't live up to the typical Mel Gibson billing. I definitely paid too much to add this to my movie collection."
5,This is Rugged Mel for you,"I really enjoyed this movie mainly because of the style and the story. One of the things I really enjoyed about it is the 70's feel. the cars are also really good looking. Payback is the best mixture of fast cars smart theives and mean mobsters.""It's time to root for the bad guy!"""
1,Don't Buy,This is not the original movie. I thought it came with the directors cut and the original. The directors cut severely lacks a great story. Up until he frames the cops the movie is the same but after that it is terrible. Kris Kristopherson is not even in it. The main person of the outfit is a woman who they don't even show!!!!!!! I repeat do not buy.
1,Not as good as the Original Theatrical Version,"I enjoyed the original theatrical version much better because the ending was much more action-packed and the best part of the whole movie. The original version was a 4-star film.The Director's Cut has an anti-climactic ending that leaves you limp. When I saw the credits roll, I said WTF & OMG...it's like they chopped off the entire ending of the first film, so that you only got to watch 2/3 of a movie.I'm going to buy a DVD of the original version. If they come out with a Blu-Ray of the original version, I'd buy it in a heartbeat and then sell the DC version."
4,Typical Mel ruthless to the bone,"Porter (Mel Gibson) common criminal is just doing his thing and rather flamboyantly. He pilfers from the bob and his cut is $70,000. He is double-crossed by his buddy and wife as he was left for dead. Well Porter may be a common criminal but he does have a sense of Justus and does whatever it takes to recover his $70,000. In the process, he is roughed up a few times and the perpetrators find themselves skillfully dispatched. The questions are will he get his money back before there is no one left to give it to him.Yep it is formula; yep Mel has a tendency for over acting. We get the standard surprises. Lots of action.Be sure to check the details out on the different packaging as there are variations on the story."
2,Directors cut < Original cut,"I know the directors cut is different from another edition which is more popular, the non-directors cut is a much better movie with a way better ending. I wish this weren't the directors cut, I'd definitely buy it then. Good movie regardless."
2,"This is not the real thing, straight up it sucks.","This movie sucks, the directors cut lost its edge, I love the original version, the darkness and the style, the gore, the background music and it's dark form is gone. I'm not a big Chris Cristopherson fan but even he's gone from this version, all scenes have been deleted, no smashing of the toes or the kidnapping of his kid. This director's cut is a whole different movie, different ending, and beggining. Its just an average movie, no wonder this cut wasn't release in theaters, once again it sucks, it may be good for a ""B"" movie but very dissapointing. I would've not waste my money if I'd known, I gave it 2 stars before the movie was over and when I finished watching it I tried to change it to 1 star but I couldn't is that bad!!!."
5,MAAAAAN THATS JUST MEAN!!!!!,"HOOOAAAH THAT LINE FROM JIMMY COBURN IS THE HIGHLIGHT THIS MOVIE, THO MEL-G & KRIS-K ARE A BIT KRUSTY, THE MOVIE ROX ***! WHERE ELSE D'YA HERE THE HUMOROUS LINES ""THATZ JUSHT MEAN"" & ""MY SUITS ARE MORE EXSHPENSHIVE THAN THAT""...HAHAHAHAHAHA MEL G ROCKS! THIS MOVIE ROX!"
2,Great Picture but....,"The picture quality was great but I didn't like Devane's version, I enjoyed the original better"
2,poot,this movie was so boring.. the ending was cool... but it had the biggest cliches you've ever seen in a movie and I hate the film they used! it's all blue-ish and whatnot... not colorful enough to interest anyone...
1,If You Saw The Theatrical Version...,"If you saw the theatrical version of this movie don't bother buying this one. It is not better at all! In fact it is a completely different movie. However if you teach editing courses at school this is a perfect movie to buy along with the original to show how different one movie can be. Besides this version sucking, they also changed the score and let the guy who composes temporary scores to compose a whole new soundtrack for the movie. Not impressed at all."
5,NOT THE STUPID DIRECTORS CUT,"If you loved this movie as much as i did, do not get the ridiculously boring makes no sense cut of payback: straight up.Lucy liu is so hot in this movie you could fry an egg on my pants.Thank you"
1,They Need To Pay ME Back... A Refund!,"The original was great. It was funny with good action. It had a great balance of both. Usually when you see directors cut its a few changes the ordinary viewer wouldn't notice or the movie could have done without. Either way it still stays true to the main movie you remember. But this movie sucked big time! I see why they cut this out and went with the one in theaters. It is almost a totally different movie. The end was AWFUL. To make matters worse, They changed the mian bad guy in the movie into a women it wasn't a good idea. You see her and your like WTF. This would have got a least 3-4 if they released this on Blu-Ray with original and this as the extra disc. I enjoyed the thearter version much more. I wish they would have warned me I would not have purchased this movie."
2,original with voice-over way better than this version,"ironic but the studio people who butchered the director`s version were RIGHT. the original version is funnier due to the voice-over which reinforces the bad ass character ie jaws as a person.Brian H version is okay but losing the humor takes the joy out of porter`s desire of 70k. Plus the ending of the original was very clever vs the this version. Ending more moralistic SPOILER ie porter is almost killed.In commentary, director states that porter would not have kidnapped the kid. but i honestly wouldnt have cared if porter did. It`s not like he killed the kid in the end ie just bait to get dad.so if you can get original version or you have seen it, then dont get this one. but if you have not seen it & like anti-heroes, then it`s not a bad movie."
2,Payback-The Director's Cut,"I purchased the movie Payback (The Director's Cut) for my husband. He was very disappointed with this version because it was a lot different than the original Payback. I guess neither of us realized that because it is ""The Director's Cut"" that it would have so many differences including the ending than the regular movie. I think it would have been nice to have the options when starting the movie to choose which version you wanted to see."
1,Epic Fail- Always count on Gibson over the Hollywood,"Wow. Normally I like Director's cuts. I just watched this version of ""Payback"" on Netflix and it was horrible. They cut out Kristofferson, his son, the kidnapping, the torture of Mel and threw together a hokie, contrived ending that the viewer could see from a mile away. This movie lost all it's appeal for me and I had to apologize to my friends I invited to watch it with me. Original was strong, somewhat unique action piece. This version fell flat and I recommend that people pick the first version."
4,"4-Stars for theatrical release, don't get Directors Cut","People keep going on and on how the Director's Cut is how the movie is meant to be. I watched both. The theatrical version is a witty and funny movie with serious moments, and you walk away knowing you watched a good movie. The Director's Cut, well you don't walk away thinking it's a good movie. Very dry, very stiff, I can't believe it's the same movie it's so much worse. For me it's night and day difference, I consider them both different films as would most other people. For which one is better, up to each individual on which they prefer. I would highly suggest watching the original theatrical version first though."
1,The Gibson version of Payback with Kris Kristofferson is better !!!,The Gibson version of Payback with Kris Kristofferson is better !!!This Director's cut is not as good as the original version.
3,aint the same movie but was ok,"I love this movie but this version of the movie is totlly different.theres some added scenes in the first half of the movie and they where good but the last 20 or 30 mins of the movie is totlly different,which I didnt like that much,wish this blu ray had both versions on it and wish the blu ray transfer of the picture was better,"
3,What the.....????,"Having seen Payback on television, and not realizing there was another version of the same story, this film was (to put it mildly) a real shock. While the story itself is interesting I suppose, the violence is pretty much overwhelming in places. Mel Gibson is simply a grotesque murderer in this film, and there are few (if any) redeeming features in his ""Porter"" character. It took most of the movie before I realized this was not just filled with scenes that had been cut because of the violence, but is in fact an entirely different film. I watched most of the special feature at the end of the movie in which Gibson and the director explained, or tried to, the difference between the two movies. Personally, I prefer the other version. The world that ""Porter"" inhabits in this, the Director's Cut, is one in which the only characters not completely depraved and immoral, the only ones worth salvaging, are Rose and the dog (and I'm not too sure about Rose.)"
2,Disappointing Movie,"This is NOT a typical Mel movie. It's dark colors throughout make you think something's wrong with your TV! It's a very slow-paced movie--a near yawner. But just at the point where you're ready to turn it off something happens, usually involving bullets or explosions. There isn't much of a story line. Overall it's not a good movie--true MG fans will be disappointed compared to some of his other roles."
1,Do Not buy the Director's Cut version,"I need to read the fine print better on Amazon.com, this DVD did not include both the Director's cut AND the Theatrical Cut like most Director's cut versions do. Impact - the Director's cut only DVD...well....sucks."
2,Completely superfluous,"Okay, so I made a mistake.I wanted a not so expensive blu-ray disc to test my PS3 capability. And since Payback is quite an excellent movie, I thought I'd try this one. Wrong.This version is not better than the previous one. Its inserts make the main character slightly less likable. The ending sucks. And the format is not 16:9, which kinda defeats the whole purpose of up-scaling (since that apparently leads to down-sizing).Big mistake."
2,Go see the original version of the book this is based on...,"...its called ""Point Blank"" with Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson. It is better in every way than this typical Hollywood tripe."
4,Please step forward 32 Years,An excellent remake of the 1967 film 'Point Blank' staring Lee Marvin as Walker. In 'Payback' the main character Walker becomes Porter. Some of the character names along with parts of the basic plot have been updated in this 1999 effort. This is a very dark and hard edged film. The original movie was based on the book 'The Hunter'. If you enjoy 'Payback' I highly recommend viewing 'Point Blank'.
5,One of Mel's best.,"This is one of my favorite movies in any genre, but by far my favorite action movie. Not so much for the action: the stunts are minimal, and there are only two explosions in the entire film! For shame! This movie is a wonderfully gritty, often sadistically violent piece of modern noir, but it is frequently funny, as well. It finds a foreboding and highly believable urban backdrop in New York City, and it the colors rarely get brighter than slate grey. I've seen this film so many times that I can nearly recite it all, even while drinking copious amounts of beer and whiskey."
4,How this movie should have been released.,"After reading the book, ""The Hunter,"" this movie is based on, I was terribly disappointed with the theatrical release of Payback. While the first half of the film is pretty much faithful to the, everything after that is a complete mess and the movie ends in a typical hollywood ending. This director's cut is much more closer to the source material, since this film is much more grittier than the theatrical version. This is what should have made it onto theaters."
5,phrase on cover says it all.,"""Get ready to root for the bad guy."" I've been a Gibson fan for years. From the Lethal Weapon series, to Braveheart, to Hamlet. So, needless to say, I had to go after reading that Mel was playing a bad guy. It's a role he naturally roles into. It's against type Mel's usually good-duy role, so that makes it more fun.It's very dark, and rather violent. Not a movie for the weak of heart.(spoiler warning) spoiler warningFrom the opening scene this movie doesn't relent. He takes change from a homeless man.Lift a guys wallet, and then assumes his identity whereupon he withdraws several hundred dollars, he buys a suit, he buys 3 expsensive watches, and immediately pawns them.(spoiler over)That said the movie is just too well acted for people to say anything negative against it."
2,ADEQUATE AT BEST,"You can do much better with other cds that both of these talented women have produced. The track listing for each are a bit boring. Kim Carnes' Mistaken Identity Collection or Bette Davis Eyes compilation cds are far superior to this poorly packaged cd. In fact, the photo of Kim Carnes looks like something a friend took with a Polaroid. K-Tel could do better with this with the history of both of these wonderful singers"
3,Great Selection,This book is great for acting students. I've used several of the monologues from this book with great success. There are some classics as well as some more obscure monologues. I would recommend adding this book to your collection of monologues or to use in the classroom for students who are having trouble finding material.
3,if you're using this for a speech team...,"The reason why I bought this book was to get a speech from it. I was in Dramatic Interpretation. Nearly all of the monologues were too short for the 8 minute time limit. I like to have my speech over 5 minutes. I did get a speech out of here, The Art of Dining by Tina Howe. But I had to combine 2 monologues. This was last year. For this season, nothing is satisfactory. I am going to buy a new book. This book is good for entertainment. I friend of mine bought the book after she heard my speech. It would be a good book for a short audition speech or a drama class. But for the purpose that I purchased it for, it failed."
2,Not enough angry monologues but great sad monologues,Look if you want a book to kind a good charicter who is serious this is not the book. But if you are looking for a comedic monologue this is your book.
1,Don't Trust Amazon Reviews,"After seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon, I thought, ""why not, I'll read it and see."" But as someone who reads profusely and minored in English Lit. in college, this is one of the worst-written books I have ever read. There was so much potential, but not much came of it. No one in the book is likeable: Rory is whipped and dumb, Bruno is a total jerk, Meg is a pain, and Austin is confused and stays that way. The only characters I liked are Meg and Austin's two young boys, who we don't see enough. This book couldn't have ended fast enough for me. If you want to read something great, try some Paul Russel, Alan Hollinghurst, or Edmund White."
2,The book is dragging along so far,"so far the book is dragging along for me , but hoping it will perk up and get better, cant review the entire book as I have struggled to get to page 67 and am hoping it gets better."
2,One of the worst books read,"Of all the books writen by the author, this one had very little character development nor left me endeared to any of the characters. It was a a 'graffitti attempt' to tell how a straight Baptist man with three sons wanted to experiement with a homosexual neighbor. My Beloved Son, of his other books, was far better."
4,Easy vacation read ...,"Oh, it is so true ... men do think with their groins. The author was able to paint a visual read on several pages that encouraged me to not put the book down. I enjoyed the lite read while relaxing on the beach."
1,Looks like the price is back down to $1,"I see that Amazon lowered the price back down to $1. At the time of my original review, they price was up around $4...hence the 1 star. The product itself works as advertised, so I give it 5 stars."
1,MIU Roller Chopper,This MIU Stainless Steel Roller Chopper is a disaster of a kitchen device. The latch on the side easily comes loose and the internal metal washers come out; getting them back in and aligned is nearly impossible. A waste of money. Robert
